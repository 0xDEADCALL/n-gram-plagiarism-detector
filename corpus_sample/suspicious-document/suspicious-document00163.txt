Now, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, under and by virtue of the
powers vested in me by the foregoing resolutions and statute, and by virtue of all other powers
thereto me enabling, do hereby, through Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, take possession
and assume control at 12 o'clock noon on the twenty-eighth day of December, 1917, of each and
every system of transportation and the appurtenances thereof located wholly or in part within
the boundaries of the continental United States and consisting of railroads, and owned or controlled
systems of coastwise and inland transportation, engaged in general transportation, whether
operated by steam or by electric power, including also terminals, terminal companies and terminal
associations, sleeping and parlor cars, private cars and private car lines, elevators, warehouses,
telegraph and telephone lines and all other equipment and appurtenances commonly used upon
or operated as a part of such rail or combined rail and water systems of transportation, to
the end that such systems of transportation be utilized for the transfer and transportation
of troops, war material and equipment to the exclusion so far as may be necessary of all other
traffic thereon, and that so far as such exclusive use be not necessary or desirable, such
systems of transportation be operated and utilized in the performance of such other services
as the national interest may require and of the usual and ordinary business and duties of common
carriers.

It is hereby directed that the possession, control, operation and utilization of such transportation
systems hereby by me undertaken shall be exercised by and through William G. McAdoo, who is
hereby appointed and designated Director-General of Railroads.

Said director may perform the duties imposed upon him, so long and to such extent as he shall
determine, through the boards of directors, receivers, officers and employees of said systems
of transportation. Until and except so far as said director shall from time to time by general
or special orders otherwise provide, the boards of directors, receivers, officers and employees
of the various transportation systems shall continue the operation thereof in the usual and
ordinary course of the business of common carriers, in the names of their respective companies.

Until and except so far as said director shall from time to time otherwise by general or special
orders determine, such systems of transportation shall remain subject to all existing statutes
and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and to all statutes and orders of regulating
commissions of the various States in which said systems or any part thereof may be situated.
But any orders, general or special, hereafter made by said director shall have paramount authority
and be obeyed as such.

Nothing herein shall be construed as now affecting the possession, operation and control of
street electric passenger railways, including railways commonly called interurban, whether
such railways be or be not owned or controlled by such railroad companies or systems. By subsequent
order and proclamation, if and when it shall be found necessary or desirable, possession, control
or operation may be taken of all or any part of such street railway systems, including subways
and tunnels, and by subsequent order and proclamation possession, control and operation in
whole or in part may also be relinquished to the owners thereof of any part of the railroad
systems or rail and water systems, possession and control of which are hereby assumed.
