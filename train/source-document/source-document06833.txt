First, we have stated the eugenic postulate, failing to grant which we and our schemes, our
votes and our hopes, will assuredly disappear or decay, as must all living races which are
not recruited from their best, Secondly, we have proceeded to analyze the nature of womanhood,
its capacities and conditions, assuming that we can scarcely discover whither it should go
unless we know what it is. To the party politician, hungry for the prizes that suit his soul
or stomach, such an assumption is mere foolish pedantry; and the ardent suffragist will have
little more to say to it. That, however, cannot be helped. It is to be hoped that all parties,
as parties, will unite in banning the views herein expressed, and then one may take heart of
grace and dare to hope that there is something in them.

They may be crystallized in the dictum that woman is Nature's supreme organ of the future.
This is not a theory, but a statement of evident truth. It is an essential canon of what one
might call the philosophy of biology, and applies to the female sex throughout living nature.
Birth is of the female alone. No sub-human male, nor even man himself, can directly achieve
the future; the greatest statesman or law-giver or founder of nations can only work, if he
knew it, through womanhood. The greatest of these, and their name is very far from legion,
was evidently Moses, as history shows, and he acted on this principle. On the other hand, those
who have sought to achieve the future, as Napoleon did, failed because they defiled and flouted
womanhood. The best men died on the battlefield and the worst were left to aid the women in
that supreme work of parenthood by which alone, and only through the co-operation of men and
women, the future is made.

Thirdly, we have seen it to follow from this dedication of the greater and vastly more valuable
part of woman's energies to the future that, just in proportion as she serves it and devotes
herself thereto, she needs present support. Biology teaches us that the male sex was invented
for this purpose; doubtless one should say for this "increasing purpose," since it is scarcely
more than foreshadowed at first in the history of the male sex. The study of life has clearly
proved that the male sex is secondary and adjuvant, and that its essentially auxiliary functions
for the race have been increasing from the beginning until we find them in perfection wherever
two parents join in common consecration and devotion to their supreme task, upon which all
else depends and without which nothing else could be.

And just as woman is mediate between man and the future, so man is mediate between woman and
the present. Woman is the more immediate environment, the special providence, so to say, of
childhood; and man, in a rightly constituted society, is the special providence, the more immediate
environment of woman, standing between her and inanimate Nature, guarding her, taking thought
for her, feeding her, using his special masculine qualities for her--that is to say, in the
long run, for the future of the race; this indeed being the purpose for which Nature has contrived
all individuals of both sexes. If we prefer such phrases, we may say that the future or the
children are parasitic upon woman, and that woman is "parasitic upon the male," which is one
woman's way of putting it. Or we may say that these are the natural and therefore divine relations
of the various forms in which human life is cast, and that our business is to make them more
effective, more provident and freer from the factors which in all ages have tended to injure them.

Fourthly, we have everywhere seen cause to condemn sex-antagonism, and it is my hope that no
page or line or word of this book can be accused of illustrating or justifying or inciting
to or even attempting to palliate either form of this wholly abominable spirit of the pit.
If such places there be, there assuredly is misdirection and falsity. This spirit is one of
the great enemies of mankind. As aroused in women against men, it has done and is doing no
little harm; as exhibited by men against the righteous claims of women, it is one of the supremely
malign forces of history. Wherever and however displayed, it is false to the first and most
essential facts of life, from the moment of the evolution of sex, hundreds of millions of years
ago, until our own time. All who display it, however excellent their intentions, are enemies
of mankind; all who work upon it for their own ends, political and personal, without feeling
it, are beneath disgust. These are things true and necessary to be said, though they should
not deter us from sympathizing with the unhappy individuals, not a few, whose lives have been
blasted by individuals of the other sex, and who show the natural but tragic tendency to make
their private injury cause for resentment against one-half of mankind. Surveying the pages
that are past, I am almost inclined to regret that, the plan of the book notwithstanding, a
special chapter was not devoted to Sex-Antagonism and to a demonstration on biological grounds
of its wickedness and pestilence wherever it be found, and whatever plausible case for it may
anywhere be made.

If the sound of hope is not heard as the ground-tone of these chapters, let it ring through
all else at the end. I am an optimist because I am an evolutionist, and because I believe,
as every one of those whom I call Eugenists must, that the best is yet to be. The dawn is breaking
for womanhood, and therefore for all mankind. If we are asked to express in one phrase the
reason why this hope is justified, it is because the long struggle between two antithetic conceptions
of human society is reaching a definite issue.

These radically opposed ideas may for convenience be called the organic and the internecine.
The internecine conception of society forever sets nation against nation, race against race,
class against class, sex against sex, individual against individual, on the ground that the
interest of one must be the injury of the other. It is false. Nay, more, for man living his
life on this earth as he must and will, it is the Great Lie.

And it is being found out. Even international trade and commerce, from which such a service
could scarcely have been expected, are here contributing to philosophy. Our fathers talked
of the comity of nations; we are beginning to discover their interdependence. The coming of
that discovery is one of the few really new things under the sun. Not so very long ago, when
mankind was far less numerous, such interdependence of nations did not exist; they were self-sufficient,
just as the patriarchal family was self-sufficient still further ago.

But the interdependence of the sexes is so far from being a new fact that it is as old as the
evolution of sex, and the decadence and disappearance of parthenogenesis or reproduction from
the female sex alone. Once bi-parental reproduction becomes necessary for the continuance of
the race, both sexes sink with either, and neither can swim but with both. Yet so far are we
from realizing this most ancient of facts to-day that, on both sides of the woman question,
wonderful to relate, are to be found controversialists who are seeking to deny this continuous
lesson of so many million ages. The reader may take his choice of folly between them. On the
one hand, there are the feminists who seek to do without man,--except for the minimum physiological
purpose. The women are to sustain the present and create the future simultaneously, and man
is to be reduced, apparently, to the function of the drone. Thus Mrs. Gilman in "Women and
Economics." Over against her and those who think with her are to be set the men, and women
too, who tell us that "men made the State,"--a sufficiently shameful admission--and that women
have no business with these things. Do not their mothers blush for such; to have travailed
so much, and to have achieved so little?

Fortunately, however, the greater number of those who think and determine the deeds of the
mass are beginning, though the dawn is yet very faint, to perceive that this truth of the interdependence
of the sexes, which is part of the greater truth that mankind is an organic whole, is not only
much truer than ever to-day, but is vital to our salvation; and save us it will. In so far
as we are keeping women inferior to men, we must raise them; in so far as we are keeping men,
in other and certainly no less important respects, inferior to women, we must raise them. The
future needs and will obtain the utmost of the highest of both sexes. Thus and thus only "springs
the crowning race of human kind": wherein, as we hasten to the dust, living for a day, yet
for ever, our eyes prophetic may behold the sure and certain hope of a glorious resurrection.

[13] It it well to quote here the most recent comment of the late Sir Francis Galton upon this
subject. It is to be found in his celebrated Huxley lecture, now published by the Eugenics
Education Society, together with much of the illustrious author's other work, under the title,
"Essays in Eugenics." The passage relevant to our discussion runs as follows:--

"There appears to be a considerable difference between the earliest age at which it is physiologically
desirable that a woman should marry and that at which the ablest, or at least the most cultured,
women usually do. Acceleration in the time of marriage, often amounting to seven years, as
from twenty-eight or twenty-nine to twenty-one or twenty-two, under influences such as those
mentioned above, is by no means improbable. What would be its effect on productivity? It might
be expected to act in two ways:--

"(1) By shortening each generation by an amount equally proportionate to the diminution in
age at which marriage occurs. Suppose the span of each generation to be shortened by one-sixth,
so that six take the place of five, and that the productivity of each marriage is unaltered,
it follows that one-sixth more children will be brought into the world during the same time,
which is roughly equivalent to increasing the productivity of an unshortened generation by
that amount.

"(2) By saving from certain barrenness the earlier part of the child-bearing period of the
woman. Authorities differ so much as to the direct gain of fertility due to early marriage
that it is dangerous to express an opinion. The large and thriving families that I have known
were the offspring of mothers who married very young."
