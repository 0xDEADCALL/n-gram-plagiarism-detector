Mr. Darling is preparing for publication a new edition of his Bibliotheca Clericales, a guide
to Authors, Preachers, Students, and Literary Men. The object of this very useful publication,
which deserves to be made a Note of by all who may have Queries to solve in connection with
the bibliography of theology, cannot be better described than in Mr. Darling's own words, namely,
that it is intended to be "a Catalogue of the Books in the Clerical Library, greatly enlarged,
so as to contain every author of any note, ancient and modern, in theology, ecclesiastical
history, and the various departments connected therewith, including a selection in most branches
of literature, with complete lists of the works of each author, the contents of every volume
being minutely described; to which will be added an entirely new volume, with a scientific
as well as alphabetical arrangement of subjects, by which a ready reference may be made to
books, treatises, sermons, and dissertations, on nearly all heads of divinity, the books, chapters,
and verses of Holy Scripture, the various festivals, fasts &c., observed throughout the year,
and useful topics in literature, philosophy, and history, on a more complete system than has
yet been attempted in any language, and forming an universal index to the contents of all similar
libraries, both public and private." The work will be published in about 24 monthly parts,
and will be put to press so soon as a sufficient number of subscribers are obtained to cover
the expense of printing.

Mr. Jones, the modeller, of 125. Drury Lane, who as our readers may remember, produced some
time since so interesting "a copy in little" of the monument of our great bard in the church
of Stratford-upon-Avon, has just completed similar models of Bacon's monument, in St. Michael's
Church, St. Alban's; of Sir Isaac Newton's, in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge; and,
lastly, of that of the "Venerable Stow," from the church of St. Andrew Undershaft. Many of
the admirers of those old English worthies will, we doubt not, be glad to possess such interesting
memorials of them.

Mr. Thorpe has published a Catalog of some Interesting, Rare, and Choice Books, which he has
recently purchased, and which had been collected by the celebrated antiquary and author, Browne
Willis. Many of them contain important manuscript notes and anecdotes by him, particularly
in his own publications; and the Catalogue, therefore, like all which Mr. Thorpe issues, contains
numerous notes highly interesting to bibliographical and literary antiquaries. Thus, in a copy
of Antonini Iter Britanniarum, he tells us Browne Willis has inserted the following biographical
note:--

     *.* "My very worthy friend Roger Gale, the Author of this and many
     other learned works, dyed at his seat at Scruton, co. York, June
     26, 1744, aged about 72, and was by his own direction buried
     obscurely in the churchyard there."

The following interesting articles we reprint entire, as forming specimens of the rarities
which Mr. Thorpe offers in the present Catalogue, and the tempting manner in which he presents
them:--

3450 BOECEUS DE CONSOLACIONE PHILOSOPHIE, TRANSLATED OUT OF LATIN INTO ENGLISH BY MAISTER GEFFREY
CHAUCER, WITH EPITAPH FOR CHAUCER IN LATIN VERSE BY STEPHEN SURIGO, POET LAUREATE OF MILAN,
AT THE COST AND INSTANCE OF W. CAXTON, A MOST BEAUTIFUL AND QUITE PERFECT COPY, WITHOUT THE
SLIGHTEST DEFECT OR REPAIR, folio, in old Oxford calf binding, from Browne Willis's Library, £105.

PRINTED BY CAXTON, WITH HIS NAME.

*.* One of the most interesting specimens of Caxton's press. No other perfect copy, I believe,
has occurred for sale. The Aleborne copy, (imperfect, wanting the Epitaph upon Chaucer, WHICH
IS REPRINTED IN SOME EDITIONS OF HIS WORKS, and other leaves,) sold for 53l. 11s. It is one
of the earliest productions of the father of the English press, and claims a very great additional
interest from being translated by the Poet Chaucer. CAXTON gives us the following reasons that
induced Chaucer to translate, and himself to print it:--"Forasmoche as the stile of it is harde,
and difficile to be understoode of simple persones, therefore the worshipful Fader and first
founder and embelisher of ornate eloquence in our English, I mene Maister Geffrey Chaucer,
hath translated it out of Latyn, as neygh as is possible to be understande; wherin, in myne
oppynon, he hath deserved a perpetual lawde and thanke of al this noble Royame of England.
Thenne, forasmoche as this sayd boke so translated is rare, and not spred ne knowen as it is
digne and worthy for the erudicion of such as ben ignoraunte, atte requeste of a singuler frend
and gossop of myne, I, William Caxton, have done my devoir temprynte it in fourme as is hereafore
made."

3653 FOX (EDWARD) BISHOP OF HEREFORD, True Dyfferens Between ye Regall Power and the Ecclesiasticall
Power, translated out of Latyn by Henry Lord Stafforde, and dedicated by him to the Protector
Somerset, black letter, 8vo. fine copy, morocco, gilt edges, EXTREMELY RARE, 6l. 6s.

Imprinted at the sign of the Rose Garland, by W. Copland, n.d.

*.* This extraordinarily rare volume was written by Edward Fox, Bishop of Hereford, according
to Strype and Leland--see the latter's encomium upon it. Lord Herbert supposed it to have been
written by King Henry VIII. It is one of the most interesting and rare volumes relative to
church history. The noble translator states that it was lent him by his friend Master Morison,
and finding the difference between the power regal and ecclesiastical so plainly set out, and
so purely explained, that rather than his countrie should be utterly frustrated of so great
fruyte as myght growe by redynge thereof, I thought it well-bestowed labour to turn it into
Englishe.

3318 LANE (JOHN) TOM TEL-TROTH'S MESSAGE AND HIS PEN'S COMPLAINT, a worke not unpleasant to
be read, nor unprofitable to be followed, IN VERSE, dedicated to George Dowse, 4to. remarkably
fine copy, UNCUT, morocco elegant, gilt edges, EXCESSIVELY RARE IF NOT UNIQUE, 10l. 10s.

Imprinted for R. Howell, 1600.

*.* This curious poem, consisting of 120 verses of six lines each, is of such EXTRAORDINARY
RARITY, AS TO HAVE ESCAPED THE RESEARCHES OF ALL BIBLIOGRAPHERS. The author is styled by Phillips,
in his Theatrum Poetarum, as that "fine old Queen Elizabeth's gentleman," and is ranked in
the class of poets next to Spenser. The present volume acquires an additional interest from
being the first production of the Author, which is thus expressed in the dedication: "These
first fruites of my barren braine, the token of my love, the seale of my affection, and the
true cognizance of my unfained affection," &c.

We have also received Supplements A, B, C, and D, the last part issued, of the Catalogue of
Miscellaneous Books, in various languages, on sale by Charles Dolman, of 61. New Bond Street,
which contain many rare and curious works, more especially in the department of Foreign Divinity.

To these we may add Parts V. and VI. of Catalogues of "Cheap Books, Autographs, &c.," on sale
by Bell, 10. Bedford Street, Covent Garden; the "Cheap Catalogue," Part XXIV., of Thomas Cole,
15. Great Turnstile, Holborn; a "Miscellaneous Catalogue of remarkably cheap Old Books," on
sale by C. Hamilton, 4. Bridge Place, City Road; Russell Smith's Catalogue of "Choice, Useful,
and Curious Books," Part VII., which he describes, very justly, as "containing some very cheap
books;" Parts CV. and CVI. of Petheram's, 94. High Holborn, "Catalogue of Old and New Books,"
containing, among other things, Collections of the works of the various publishing Societies,
such as the Camden, Calvin, Parker, Shakspeare, Ray, &c., and also of the Record publications;
and lastly, which we have just received from the worthy bibliopole of Auld Reekie, T.G. Stevenson,
his curious "List of Unique, Valuable, and Interesting Works, chiefly illustrative of Scottish
History and Antiquities, printed at private expense," and "Bannatyniana,--Catalogue of the
privately printed publications of the Bannatyne Club from MDCCCXXIII. to MDCCCXLVIII.," both
of which are well deserving the attention of our bibliographical friends. 5, 6, and 7.)

This work was originally written to show how the early history of Denmark might be read through
its monuments, and has been translated and applied to the history of similar remains in England,
in the hope that it will be found a useful hand-book for the use of those who desire to know
something of the nature of the numerous primeval monuments scattered over these Islands, and
the light which their investigation is likely to throw over the earliest and most obscure periods
of our National History.

     "This volume is a curious instance of the effect of early
     association ... Early knowledge of the genius loci has left an
     impression on the editor's mind which has produced this very
     completely illustrated edition. All that research can furnish
     touching the families of Wrightson and Railton, the surnames of
     Edwin and Emma, is collected."--Spectator.

     "The editor's great merit is that of exhausting every probable
     source of information, and equal industry spent in illustration of
     a more important subject, would have led to equally curious and
     more important results."--Athenaeum. 1849.
