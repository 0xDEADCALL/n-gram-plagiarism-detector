PREFACE.

The selections in the HIGH SCHOOL READER have been chosen with the belief that to pupils of
such advancement as is required for entrance into High Schools and Collegiate Institutes, oral
reading should be taught from the best literature, inasmuch as it not only affords a wide range
of thought and sentiment, but it also demands for its appropriate vocal interpretation such
powers of sympathy and appreciation as are developed only by culture; and it is to impart culture
that these institutions of higher learning have been established.

Experience has shown that it is from their ordinary reading books that pupils obtain their
chief practical acquaintance with literature, and the selections here presented have been made
with this in remembrance. They have been taken from the writings of authors of acknowledged
representative character; and they have been arranged for the most part chronologically, so
that pupils may unconsciously obtain some little insight into the history of the development
of the literary art. They have also been so chosen as to convey a somewhat fair idea of the
relative value and productivity of authorship in the three great English-speaking communities
of the world--the mother countries, our neighbours' country, and our own.

While a limited space, if nothing else, prevents the collection here made from being a complete
anthology, yet it does pretend to represent the authors selected in characteristic moods, and
(in so far as is possible in a school book, and a reading text-book) to present a somewhat
fair perspective of the world of authorship. It may be said that, if this be so, some names
are conspicuously absent: McGee, Canada's poet-orator; Parkman, who has given to our country
a place in the portraiture of nations; William Morris, the chief of the modern school of romanticism;
Tyndall, who of the literature of science has made an art; Lamb, daintiest of humorists; Collins,
"whose range of flight," as Swinburne says, "was the highest of his generation." Either from
lack of space, or from some inherent unsuitableness in such selections as might otherwise have
been made, it was found impossible to represent these names worthily; but as they are all more
or less adequately represented in the Fourth Reader, the teacher who may wish to correct the
perspective here presented may refer his pupils to the pieces from these authors there given.
It may be added, too, that the body of recent literature is so enormous, that no adequate representation
of it (at any rate as regards quantity) is possible within the limits of one book.

The selections in poetry, with but three necessary exceptions, are complete wholes, and represent,
as fairly as single pieces can, the respective merits and styles of their authors. The selections
in prose cannot, of course, lay claim to this excellence; but they are all complete in themselves,
or have been made so by short introductions; and it is hoped that they too are not unfairly
representative of their authors. In many cases they are of somewhat unusual length; by this,
however, they gain in interest and in representative character.

In some of the prose selections, passages have occasionally been omitted, either because they
interfered with the main narrative, or because, as they added nothing to it, to omit them would
be a gain of space. In most cases these omissions are indicated by small asterisks.

All the selections, both in prose and in verse, have been made with constant reference to their
suitableness for the teaching of reading. They are fitted to exemplify every mode of expression,
except, perhaps, that appropriate to a few of the stronger passions. It is not pretended that
they are all simple and easy. Many of them will require much study and preparation before they
can be read with that precision of expression which is necessary to perfect intelligibility.
The chronological arrangement precludes grading; the teacher will decide in what order the
selections are to be read.

The introductory chapter is mainly intended to assist the teacher in imparting to his pupils
a somewhat scientific knowledge of the art of reading. Of course the teacher will choose for
himself his mode of dealing with the chapter, but it has been written with the thought that
he should use it as a convenient series of texts, which he might expand and illustrate in accordance
with his opportunities and judgment. Examples for illustration are indispensable to the successful
study of the principles described, and they should be sought for and obtained by the teacher
and pupils together (whenever possible they should be taken from the READER), and should be
kept labeled for reference and practice. If the application of these principles be thus practically
made by the pupils themselves, they will receive a much more lasting impression of their meaning
and value than if the examples were given to them at no cost of thought or search on their part.

To the teacher it is recommended that he should not be contented with the short and necessarily
imperfect exposition of the art of reading therein given. The more familiar he is with the
scientific principles the more successfully will he be able to direct the studies and practices
of his pupils. Works on elocution are numerous and accessible. Dr. Rush's Philosophy of the
Voice is perhaps the foundation of all subsequent good work in the exposition of voice culture.
Professor Murdoch's Analytic Elocution is an exhaustive and scholarly treatise based upon it,
and to the plan of treatment therein fully developed the practical part of the introductory
chapter has largely conformed.

The pleasing task remains of thanking those authors who have so kindly responded to requests
for permission to use selections from their works: to President Wilson, for a sonnet from Spring
Wild Roses, and for Our Ideal; to Mr. Charles Sangster, for two sonnets from Hesperus; to Mr.
John Reade, for two poems from The Prophecy of Merlin; to Mr. Charles Mair, for the scenes
from Tecumseh; and to Professor C. G. D. Roberts, for To Winter.

To Miss A. T. Jones, thanks are due for permission to use Abigail Becker, recently published
in the Century Magazine. The heroic acts described in this poem seem so wonderful, so greatly
superior to woman's strength, even to human strength and endurance, to accomplish, that were
it possible to doubt its truthfulness, doubt one certainly would. Nevertheless the poem is
not only strictly in accordance with the facts, it is even within and below them.

INTRODUCTORY.

The ability to read well cannot be attained without much pains and study. For even a moderate
proficiency in the art of reading two requirements are essential: (1) A cultivated mind quick
to perceive the sequence of thoughts which the words to be read logically express, and equally
quick in its power sympathetically to appreciate the sentiment with which the words are informed--the
feeling, emotion, passion, which pervades them--but which they suggest rather than actually
portray; and (2) a voice so perfected that its utterances fall upon the ear of the listener
with pleasing effect, and so flexible that it can be managed skilfully to convey to him the
full meaning and force of all the ideas and sentiments formally expressed by the words or latent
in them. Of these two requirements the first is undeniably the more important; and that training
in the art of reading in which the close, persistent, and liberal study of literature for its
own sake has not proceeded pari passu with the requisite exercises for the development of the
powers of the voice and with the study of the principles of vocal interpretation, has resulted
in a meretricious accomplishment of very illusive value.

Nor will the special study and accurate mastery of a number of individual selections give that
readiness of mental apprehension which is indispensable to a good reader. The ability quickly
to recognize word-forms and to utter them with ease, to catch the drift of ideas, and to feel
ready sympathy with change and flow in sentiment, is not to be had without a long course of
wide and varied reading. No one can become a good reader by passing through, no matter how
carefully, a set of reading text-books merely. Pupils should be encouraged to read for themselves.
They should, of course, be guided in their selection of reading matter, and they should be
helped to acquire a taste for that which is purest and most helpful in literature; but unless
they form a habit of reading, and of reading thoughtfully and with precision, they can never
become good readers.

In oral reading, readiness and accuracy depend largely upon the alertness and flexibility of
the vocal organs, and to secure ease and excellence in the working of their delicate mechanism
much practice is necessary. The pupil should persistently read aloud. A practice of this sort,
watchfully pursued, with a reasonable degree of self-discipline in the correction or avoidance
of errors, is helpful not alone in obtaining a mastery of the reading art, and in mental culture,--it
is equally beneficial as a physical exercise. It will, however, be much more efficacious of
good, both of mind and of body, if pursued in accordance with those principles of voice culture
and of vocal interpretation, which experience and special study have established.

But only a small proportion of all the reading that is done, is oral reading. It is silent
reading that is universally employed as an instrument of study, of business, of amusement.
As a rule, however, very little provision is made for the acquirement of a facility in silent
reading; this, it is thought, will result as a by-product of the regular training in oral reading.
Almost the reverse of this is true. Ease and flexibility of articulation, quickness in catching
the drift of ideas, and readiness in varying the tones of the voice in the utterance of words
so as impressively to portray their latent sentiment,--all this is possible with those alone
to whom difficult word-forms, complex sentence-structures, and the infinite variety and play
of thought and emotion, are more or less familiar through such a wide range of reading as only
the silent prosecution of it makes possible.

The art of oral reading, however, though not so generally needful as silent reading, is still
of great importance to everyone in respect of its practical utility simply,--though few of
those whose duty it is to read aloud in public, do so either with accuracy or grace; as an
accomplishment which may be used to give pleasure to others, it is, when perfectly possessed,
not excelled by any other; so that as an acquisition which puts one in a position of vantage
either for benefitting one's self or for bestowing delight or benefit upon others, it is worth
every necessary struggle for its attainment.

One of the most valuable results of oral reading when systematically pursued as a school study,
is the effect which it has in improving the tones of the voice for ordinary conversation and
discourse, and in securing some measure of orthoepy as a fixed habit of utterance. Conversational
speech is notoriously slovenly. The sonority of our vowels is lost, and their distinguishing
qualities are obscured; and with unnoticed frequency our consonants are either dropped or amalgamated
with one another. Yet, while amendment in these matters is to be striven for, there is nothing
that the teacher who wishes to establish habits of orthoepy has to be more watchful in guarding
against, than bestowing upon his pupils an affected or mincing utterance, all the more ludicrous
and objectionable, it may be, in that a certain set of words are pronounced with over-nicety,
while almost all others are left in a state of neglected vulgarity.

Too frequently the study of oral reading is pursued with reference solely to the prospective
public use of the art in the declamation of prepared passages; and the elocution-master's science
has been brought into some discredit by wide discrepancies between the performances of his
pupils in their well-drilled and often hackneyed selections and their ability to read unfamiliar
pieces at sight. It is quite true that voice culture is greatly aided by the close study and
frequent rendering of selections suitably chosen for the elocutionary difficulties which they
present; but it should never be forgotten that good reading, the sort of reading which the
schoolmaster should above all else endeavor to make his pupils proficient in, implies the ability
so to read a plain account, a story, an oration, a play, or what not, at sight, with absolute
correctness as to pronunciation, with such clearness of articulation and appropriateness of
sentence utterance as will make it perfectly audible and intelligible to one's auditors, and
with such suitable and impressive intonations as will put them in full possession of those
emotions which may be said to be the essence or spirit of the piece;--and, moreover, to do
all this with pleasure to one's hearers and with ease to one's self. Now as comparatively few
readers are ever required to read in public, and as in the home-circle everyone ought to read,
it is plain that the first duty of the teacher of elocution is to develop in his pupils a mastery
of such a style of reading as is appropriate to small audiences; and, then, if he have time
and opportunity, to extend and amplify the practice of his art so as to fit such as are capable
of fuller mastery of it to appear before greater audiences. For though all voices are capable
of being much improved through cultivation, few only can be adapted to the requirements of
a large auditorium; and the care and attention which should be devoted to the benefit of all
should not be spent for the advantage merely of the few.

And moreover, those practices and studies which voice culture and the attainment of a knowledge
of the principles of vocal interpretation demand, may be pursued by all in common. That alone
which is necessary for the public reader or orator, is a more extended, and, perhaps, a more
earnest and thoughtful practice.

Although practices for the improvement of the voice cannot proceed far without attention to
the principles of vocal interpretation, and though the study of the latter necessarily includes
the former, yet for the sake of clearness the elementary principles of voice culture may be
discussed separately from their application in the interpretation of thought and sentiment.

With respect both to articulation and expression the generic properties of the voice are five,
namely: Quality, Pitch, Force, Time, Abruptness. Of these properties there are, of course,
many modes or degrees, but the voice must, in every tone that it utters, manifest itself in
some mode or other of each; and it is the possibility of infinite choice in the ways of combining
the modes that gives to vocal expression its infinite possibility of variety. The principles
of voice culture will be best understood, however, if these properties be considered separately.

=Quality= has reference to the kind of the voice in respect of its smoothness or roughness,
sonority or thinness, musicalness or harshness; also in respect of the completeness of its
vocality.

=Pitch= has reference to the degree of elevation or depression in what is called in music the
scale. It may be used specifically, in reference to single tones or syllables (either as to
their opening, or as to their whole utterance), or generally, as descriptive of the prevailing
tone or note which the voice assumes in reading a sentence or passage.

=Force= has reference to the power or intensity with which the sounds of the voice are uttered.
When force is used in the utterance of single syllables, in whole or in part, it is spoken
of as =Stress=.

=Time= is rate of utterance. It is used with reference both to single syllables, and to phrases,
sentences, and passages. In regard to single syllables it is sometimes called =Quantity=. In
the consideration of time may be included that of pauses and rhythms.

=Abruptness= has reference to the relative suddenness with which syllables may be uttered.
It may vary from the most delicate opening to a forcible explosion.

Vocality depends upon respiration. All exercises, therefore, which are effective in increasing
the vigor, freedom, and elasticity of the breathing apparatus, may be taken as initiatory steps
in voice culture; and, in moderation, they should be practised continually. Full, slow inspirations
followed by slow, and, as far as possible, complete expirations; full, quick inspirations similarly
followed; full inspirations followed by sudden and forcible expirations; full, deep inspirations,
followed by slow, slightly but distinctly audible expirations, as in deep sighing; these and
similar practices may be pursued. What is to be aimed at is to secure complete control of the
breath, especially to the degree that, with perfect deliberateness, it can be equably and smoothly
effused.

In all exercises where vocality is required it is best first to use the sound of ä, as in far,
for in this sound the quality of the human voice is heard in most perfection, and in uttering
it the vocal organs are most flexible and most easily adapt themselves to change. It may be
preceded by the aspirate h, or by some consonant, as may be thought necessary.

In effective speaking or reading, with respect to the abruptness and rapidity of expiration
there are three modes of utterance: the =effusive=, by which the voice is poured forth smoothly
and equably, the =expulsive= and the =explosive=. Of these three modes the effusive is by far
the most important, but the others, and especially the expulsive, have their uses also. These
modes will be illustrated in the following exercise:

    EXERCISE.--1. After a full and deliberate inspiration let the
    expiration of the element h be gently effected, until the
    lungs are exhausted--the aspiration coming from the very depths
    of the throat. Let this be repeated with the syllable häh,
    audibly whispered. This is effusive utterance.

    2. After a full and deliberate inspiration let the expiration of
    the element h be suddenly effected, the expiration being
    continued until the whispering sound vanishes in the bottom of
    the throat. Let this be repeated with the syllable häh,
    audibly whispered. This is expulsive utterance.

    3. Let the exercise be the same as in (2) except that the
    expiration is to be much more forcibly effected, and completed
    almost instantaneously. This is explosive utterance.

In the cultivation of the voice either one of two ends is generally kept in view--its improvement
for speaking or its improvement for singing; but progress may be made towards both ends by
the same study, and those exercises which benefit the singing voice benefit the speaking voice,
and vice versa. The distinction between speaking tones and singing tones should be clearly
understood. Musical tones are produced by isochronous (equal-timed) vibrations of the vocal
organs continued for some length of time. Hence, a musical tone is a note, which may be prolonged
at will without varying in pitch, either up or down. A speaking tone, on the contrary, is produced
by vibrations which are not isochronous; it is not a note, properly so called, and can not
be prolonged, without varying in pitch. Musical tones are discrete,--the voice passes from
pitch to pitch through the intervals silently. In speaking, every tone, however short the time
taken in uttering it, passes from one pitch to some other through an interval concretely, that
is, with continuous vocality; though, with respect to one another, speech syllables, like notes
in music, are discrete. This may be exemplified by uttering the words, "Where are you going?"
In singing these words, they may be uttered on the same note, or on different notes, or, indeed,
with different notes for the same word; but the voice skips from note to note through the intervals.
In speaking the words, each is uttered with an inflection or intonation in which the voice
varies in pitch, but passes through the interval concretely; the separate words, however, and
the separate syllables (if there were any) being uttered discretely. Musical utterance might
be graphically illustrated by a series of horizontal lines of less or greater length succeeding
one another at different distances above or below a fixed horizontal line. In a similar notation
for speech utterance the lines would all be curved, to represent the concrete passage through
the various intervals. It is the concrete intonation of every syllable and monosyllabic word
which gives to speech its distinctive character from music. Each syllable and monosyllabic
word is called a =concrete=, and it is with the concrete in all its various possibilities of
utterance that voice culture has mainly to do.

The intervals traversed by the voice in uttering the concrete are very variable. Using the
musical scale for reference it may be said that in ordinary speech they are generally of but
one, or, at most, two notes. In animated discourse or passionate utterance the intervals may
be greater. For illustration, let the pronoun "I" be uttered in a tone of interrogative surprise;
a concrete with a rising interval will be the result. The more the surprise is emphasized,
especially if indignation be conjoined with it, the greater will be the interval that the voice
passes through in uttering the concrete. If the word "lie" be given immediately after the pronoun
with the same intensity of feeling, the voice discretely descends from the high pitch heard
at the end of the utterance of the pronoun, and in uttering the next concrete, again ascends
through an interval, of less or more extent according to the emphasis which is imparted to it.

Again, in speech of sorrow, murmuring, piteous complaint, and the like, concrete intervals
of less extent than those used in ordinary discourse are often heard. Thus, if the sentence
"Pity me, kind lady, I have no mother," be uttered with a plaintive expression, concretes with
small intervals will be distinctly noticeable; but it will be also noticed that with respect
to one another the syllables are discretely uttered, just as in the sentence where the concrete
intervals were much greater.

Without intending a scientifically accurate and rigid statement, it may be said (again borrowing
the terminology of music) that in ordinary speech the concretes are uttered with intervals
of a second, or at most a third; that in very expressive or impassioned utterance intervals
of a fifth or an octave are frequently used; and that the mode of progression from syllable
to syllable is diatonic, that is, not concretely, but discretely from tone to tone; and further,
that in plaintive language, the syllables are uttered concretely with intervals of a semitone
only, but that the mode of progression from syllable to syllable is still discrete.

Sometimes, but rarely, syllables are uttered tremulously, or with a tremor; that is, with constituent
intervals of less than a semitone, uttered discretely in rapid succession, and passing, in
the aggregate, through an interval of more or less width. An exaggerated form of this utterance
may be heard in the neighing of a horse.

    EXERCISE.--1. Utter the syllable pä as a concrete, with rising
    and falling intervals, severally, of a second, third,
    fifth, and an octave; also with intervals of a semitone;
    also with a tremor. Let the exercise be varied so as to
    include many degrees of initial pitch. Use a diagram of a
    musical staff for reference.

    2. Read with exaggerated impressiveness, "Am =I= to be your
    slave? =No!="

In the pronunciation of the letter [=a], as in pate, two sounds are heard: the first is that
of the name of the letter, which is uttered with some degree of fulness; the second is that
of [=e] in mete, but, as it were, tapering and vanishing;--in the meantime the voice traverses
a rising interval of one tone, that is, of a second. The utterance of these two sounds, although
the sounds themselves are distinct, is completely continuous, from the full opening of the
one to the vanishing close of the other, and it is impossible to say where the first ends and
where the last begins. It is essential, however, to consider them separately. The first is
called the =radical movement=, and the second the =vanishing movement=; and these together
constitute the entire concrete.

All the vowels do not equally well exemplify in their utterance a distinction of sound in their
radical and vanishing movements, because some vowel sounds are less diphthongal than others,
and some, again, are pure monophthongs; but these two movements and the concrete variation
of pitch, the result of one impulse of the voice, are the essential structure of every syllable,
and are characteristic of speech-notes as contradistinguished from those of song.

When the radical and vanishing movements are effected smoothly, distinctly, and without intensity
or emotion, commencing fully and with some abruptness, and terminating gently and almost inaudibly,
the result is the =equable concrete=. This of course may be produced with intervals, either
upward or downward, of any degree--tone, semitone, third, fifth, or octave. It must be said,
however, that some syllables, and even some vowels, lend themselves more easily than others
to that prolonged utterance which is essential to the production of wide intervals and the
perfectness of the vanishing movement.

The equable concrete is the natural, simple mode of utterance; but under the influence of interest,
excitement, passion, and so on, the utterance of the concrete may be greatly varied from this
by means of stress, or force applied to some part or to all of its extent. The different variations
may be described as follows:

(1) =Radical Stress=, where force is applied to the opening of the concrete. (It should be
said that a slight degree of radical stress is given even in the equable concrete, producing
its full, clear opening.)

(2) =Loud Concrete=, where force is applied throughout the whole concrete, the proportion of
the radical to the vanish remaining unaltered.

(3) =Median Stress=, where force is applied to the middle of the concrete, producing a swell,
or impressive fulness.

(4) =Compound Stress=, where force is applied in an unusual degree to each extremity of the
concrete.

(5) =Final Stress=, where force is applied to the end of the concrete, the radical stress being
somewhat diminished in fulness.

(6) =Thorough Stress=, where force is so applied that the concrete has the same fulness throughout.

    EXERCISE.--With the syllable pä exemplify the equable
    concrete and the several varieties of stress, using different
    degrees of initial or radical pitch, and the various intervals
    of the tone, semitone, third, fifth, and octave. The exercises
    for the radical stress should be first aspirated, then repeated
    with full vocality.

Besides the forms of the simple rising and falling intervals in which the concrete is generally
uttered, there is another form, called the =wave=, effected by a union of these modes. It is
of two varieties: (1) where a rising movement is continued into a falling movement, called
the =direct wave=; (2) where a falling movement is continued into a rising movement, called
the =inverted wave=. Waves may pass through all varieties of intervals, and may be either (1)
equal, where the voice in both members passes through the same interval; or (2) unequal, where
in one flexion the interval traversed by the voice is greater than in the other.

    EXERCISE.--With the syllable p[=a] exemplify the different
    kinds of waves, with the same variations of radical pitch,
    interval, and stress, as before.

The elementary sounds of speech are of three natural divisions; the tonics, the subtonics,
and the atonics.

The =Tonics= are the simple vowels and diphthongs. They are of perfect vocality; they admit
the concrete rise and fall through all the intervals of pitch; they may be uttered with more
abruptness than the other elements; and being capable of indefinite prolongation they can receive
the most perfect exemplification of the vanishing movement. They may be said to be: [a:], as
in all; ä, as in arm; [.a], as in ask; [)a], as in an; [=a], as in ate; â, as in air; [=e],
as in eve; [)e], as in end; ë, as in err; [=i], as in ice; [)i], as in inn; [=o], as in old;
ö, as in or; [)o], as in odd; [=u], as in use; [)u], as in up; [=o][=o], as in ooze; [)o][)o],
as in book; oi, as in oil; ou, as in out. (There are various ways of arranging and classifying
these.)

    EXERCISE.--Exemplify generally the equable concrete, loud
    concrete, radical stress, and median stress, with upward and
    downward intervals, with clear, sharp openings, and with
    gradually attenuated vanishes, upon each of the tonic
    elements.

The =Subtonics= possess the properties of vocality and prolongation in some degree, but much
less perfectly than the tonics, and their vocality (known as the vocal murmur) is the same
for all. They are as follows:--b, d, g, v, z, y, w (as in woe), th (as in then), zh (as z in
azure), j (as in judge, by some considered not elementary), l, m, n, ng (as in sing), r (as
in ran), and r (as in far). They can not, without great effort, be given an abrupt opening,
and so are not capable of much radical fulness, but from their property of vocality they can
receive, to a considerable degree, an exemplification of the vanishing movement.

    EXERCISE.--Utter the word bud slowly, and detach from the rest
    of the word the obscure murmur heard in pronouncing the first
    letter: this is the subtonic represented by b. Utter this
    sound with different degrees of initial pitch, and with
    different intervals, both downward and upward. Produce as full
    an opening of the radical movement as possible, but do not
    attempt to give it much stress. Obtain in every case a distinct
    vanish. Be careful not to convert the subtonic into a tonic.
    Proceed in a similar manner with the other subtonics. Then,
    distinctly obtaining the subtonics, unite them severally with
    the sound of ä, first forcibly, then more gently, producing
    such syllables as bä, dä, etc., which may be rendered with
    upward and downward intervals, and with different degrees of
    initial pitch. Finally, with such syllables as äb, äd, äg,
    äv, etc., exemplify all the varieties of stress.

The =Atonics= correspond with the first eleven of the subtonics as given above, from which
they differ almost alone in having no vocality. They are p, t, k, f, s, h, wh (as in when),
th (as in thin), sh, and ch (as in child, by some considered not elementary).

    EXERCISE.--1. Form a list of such words as pipe, tote,
    kick, fife, siss, etc., and severally utter them slowly,
    holding the final element for a moment, and then letting the
    breath escape suddenly; then, holding the initial letter firmly
    for a moment let it come forcibly against the sound of the
    remainder of the word, producing an abrupt opening, and radical
    stress of the vowel concrete. 2. Aspirate strongly the atonics
    as given above.

    EXERCISE RECAPITULATORY.--1. Produce the syllable pä in an
    articulate whisper in all the different varieties of pitch,
    interval, and stress. 2. Repeat with such syllables as paw,
    pooh, p[=o]h, etc. 3. Utter these syllables (1) expulsively,
    (2) explosively, with varying intervals both upward and
    downward, and producing distinct and clearly attenuated
    vanishes. 4. Select some passage of poetry involving passionate
    thought, and read in articulated whispers, with appropriate
    intonations, somewhat exaggerated, it may be. Let the intervals
    and stresses be slowly and distinctly given. 5. Repeat the
    exercise in a half whisper. 6. Next read the passage over
    several times in pure vocality, without exaggeration, increasing
    the strength of the utterance until it is as full and ringing as
    possible. Care must be taken that the utterance is in reality
    full and ringing, not sharp and hard. Let the pitch chosen be
    not too high--as low as possible; and let the tones come mainly
    from the chest and lower part of the throat.

NOTE.--In all the exercises care should be taken that they be performed easily and naturally,
with perfect deliberation and without undue force; else they will be harmful rather than useful.

    EXERCISE IN CONCRETE INTERVALS CONTINUED.--1. Read with
    appropriate intonations: "Did you say [a:], as in all?"--"No,
    I said ä, as in arm,"--producing in the emphatic syllables
    suitable rising or falling intervals of one tone. Then repeat,
    but with greater emphasis, producing intervals of a third, a
    fifth, or an octave. Vary the sentences so as to include all the
    tonic elements. 2. With each tonic element, severally, produce
    first a rising and then a falling interval, each of a tone; then
    intervals of a third, a fifth, and an octave. 3. Extend the
    exercise so as to produce with each element, and with all the
    various intervals, a series or succession of rising and falling
    intervals, thus: rising, falling, rising, falling, etc. Use
    the blackboard and the musical scale for illustration and
    reference.

Syllables vary greatly in their capacity for prolongation, and in this respect are classified
into immutable, mutable, and indefinite.

=Immutable Syllables= are almost incapable of prolongation; they are those which end in one
of the abrupt atonic elements, p, t, k; as tip, hit, kick; or in one of the abrupt subtonics,
b, d, g; as tub, thud, pug. Some syllables that so end, by virtue of tonic or subtonic elements
which they may contain, are capable of some prolongation; for example, warp, dart, block, grab,
dread, grog. These are called =Mutable Syllables=.

=Indefinite Syllables= are capable of almost indefinite prolongation; they are those which
terminate in a tonic, or any subtonic except one of the three abrupt subtonics, b, d, g; for
example, awe, fudge, hail, arm.

NOTE.--It must be remembered that when for the sake of exercise or effect syllables are extended
in time, they must be so uttered that their identity is not impaired,--that is, their enunciation
must be free from mouthing.

As has been remarked before our pronunciation of vowels is notoriously careless; but by a little
attention anyone can easily free himself from this reproach. Frequent practice in the accurate
enunciation of the tonic elements as given above, and a habit of watchfulness established as
to the orthoepy of those which are most easily obscured, in all words in which they occur,
will soon secure, if not a resonant, sonorous utterance with respect to the tonic elements,
at least a correct pronunciation. But the correct and distinct pronunciation of the subtonic,
and especially of the atonic, elements, when they occur, as is so frequent in English words,
in combination, is not so easily accomplished; and orthoepy, in this respect, as a habit, cannot
be secured without great care and incessant practice. For example, the word months is habitually
pronounced by almost everyone as if it were spelled munce. The following list for practice
will afford material to begin with; other lists should be prepared by the teacher.

Plinth, blithe, sphere, shriek, quote, whether, tipt, depth, robed, hoofed, calved, width,
hundredth, exhaust, whizzed, hushed, ached, wagged, etched, pledged, asked, dreamt, alms, adapts,
depths, lefts, heav'ns, meddl'd, beasts, wasps, hosts, exhausts, gasped, desks, selects, facts,
hints, healths, tenths, salts, builds, wilds, milked, mulcts, elms, prob'd'st, think'st, hold'st,
attempt'st, want'st, heard'st, mask'st.

    EXERCISE.--Utter the words in the above list in distinct
    articulate whispers; then with vocality, softly and gently.
    Avoid hissing and mouthing.

While, in reading, distinct enunciation is an excellence to be aimed at, yet the words of a
sentence should not be uttered as if completely severed from one another. Every sentence falls
naturally into groups, the several groups being composed of words related in sense; and for
impressive reading the words of each group should be implicated, or tied together. For example,
in the line, Once upon a midnight dreary, while I ponder'd, weak and weary, there are naturally
three groups; in the line, The quality of mercy is not strain'd, there is but one. In these
groups the terminal sound of each word is implicated with the initial sound of the succeeding
word. If the terminal sound is a tonic, or a flowing subtonic, the implication consists of
a gentle murmuring prolongation of the terminal element coalescing with the initial element
of the next word; if the terminal element is a flowing atonic the prolongation will not be
accompanied by a murmur; but in either case the vocal organs, while prolonging the sound of
one word, prepare, as it were, to begin the next. If the terminal element be one of the abrupt
subtonics the vocal murmur is difficult to produce, and in this case, and also when the terminal
element is an abrupt atonic, there is a suspension of the voice for a time equal to that occupied
by the murmuring prolongation in the other cases; but the organs keep the position which they
have in finishing the one word until they relax to take position for the utterance, with renewed
exertion, of the opening sound of the next.

It must be added that this implication is not confined to the component words of a group; for
the sake of impressiveness the groups themselves are often implicated,--but by suspension of
the voice and a maintenance of the vocal organs in their previous position, before they suddenly
relax to form the opening sound of the first word in their next group, rather than by the murmuring
prolongation above described.

    EXERCISE.--Read with suitable implication: (1) O Tiber! father
    Tiber! to whom the Romans pray, a Roman's life, a Roman's arms,
    take thou in charge this day! (2) But still the patriot, and
    the patriot-bard, in bright succession raise, her ornament and
    guard.

The nicety with which implication should be effected depends, like exactness of articulation,
upon the gravity, complexity, fervor, grace, beauty, or other distinguishing and elevated quality
of the thoughts and sentiments contained in the words to be read. Common-place ideas are couched,
as a rule, in common-place language, and require no nice discrimination of sounds, or other
refinement of utterance, for their full rendering; but in true poetry and impassioned prose
implication is no mean instrument of effectual interpretation.

The speaking voice, like the singing voice, is capable of utterance through a considerable
range of pitch--in highly cultivated voices, of three octaves; in less highly cultivated voices,
of one octave; but for all voices, not perverted by bad habit, there are three or four notes,
of moderate height, upon which utterance is most easy and natural, and most capable of great
and sustained effort. These notes should be selected as the =normal pitch= of discourse.

In speaking or reading, except in certain infrequent cases, the whole of the breath expired
from the lungs should be utilized in producing =pure vocality=. Should any breath be spent
in aspiration, or in hissing, or in guttural enunciation, the vocality is said to be =impure=.
Impure vocality, it is true, has its own appropriate use, in the representation of certain
emotional states of the mind. Pure vocality is heard naturally in the tones of children at
play; but in adults, through carelessness or injudicious education, it is often wanting.

The mechanism of the voice is very complicated and not thoroughly understood. It is a matter
of common experience, however, that in the utterance of tones of low pitch, whether speech
tones or musical, the voice seems to come from the chest rather than from the head; and, in
the utterance of tones of high pitch, on the other hand, it seems to come from the head rather
than from the chest; so that all tones are said to belong either to the lower or chest register,
or to the higher or head register. As both chest tones and head tones may be obscured by impurities,
and their resonance diminished or destroyed by defective enunciation, the pure, clear, ringing
utterance of tones of both registers should be constantly striven for. The normal pitch of
utterance, referred to above, should always be such that the tones comprised in it can be produced
either from the head or from the chest, at will; but for sustained efforts, for the best effects
both of reading and of oratory, the chest tones are much to be preferred, since, as compared
with head tones, they are capable of being produced with greater resonance and penetrating
power, and, for any considerable length of time, with greater ease to the speaker.

All tones of the human voice, whether speaking or musical, whether of the head or of the chest,
are spoken of as having =quality=, or =timbre=, and the term is also used more generally in
reference to the whole compass of utterance. The quality of the voice is its most distinguishing
characteristic, and it is upon its cultivation and improvement that the greatest efforts of
the student should be spent. Pure voice is usually spoken of as being manifested in two qualities,
the natural and the orotund.

=Natural Quality= may be described as a head tone to which some degree of resonance is given
by the chest; but the brilliancy of its resonance is produced by its reverberation against
the bony arch of the mouth. It may, of course, vary in pitch, but tones of low pitch that are
intended to be impressive are most suitably rendered in orotund quality. In its perfect manifestations,
the natural quality should be clear, ringing, light, and sparkling,--if it be possible to describe
its characteristics by such metaphorical words.

=Orotund Quality= is the result only of cultivation, but no speaker or reader can produce those
finer effects which are the appropriate symbols of strong and deep emotion, whose voice cannot
assume this mode at will. It differs from the natural mode in obtaining from the chest a greater
supply of air, and a deeper and fuller resonance, and the reverberations seem to be against
the walls of the pharynx, or posterior regions of the mouth, rather than against the palate,
or upper part of the mouth. In fulness, strength, and ringing quality, it is superior to the
natural mode, but not distinct from it; in clearness and smoothness it should be equal to it.
As it befits a chest tone rather than a head tone, it is natural to utterances in medium and
low pitch; but it must not be confounded with low pitch simply, nor must its characteristic
fulness be taken for loudness simply. With the orotund, as well as with the natural quality,
all the voice modes previously described may be conjoined.

    EXERCISE.--1. With the syllable häh, make an expiration in the
    voice of whisper, forcing slowly all air out from the chest.
    Then give to this expiration vocality, producing the
    reverberation far back in the mouth: the resulting utterance is
    a hoarse exemplification of the orotund. With the mouth in the
    position of a yawn, making the cavity of reverberation as large
    as possible, repeat the exercise until the utterance can be
    produced smoothly and without hoarseness. 2. Form similar
    syllables containing other tonic elements, and make similar
    exercises, taking care to produce a smooth, effusive utterance.
    3. Select a sentence such as "Roll on thou deep and dark blue
    ocean, roll," abounding in long open vowels and indefinite
    syllables, and using suitable intonations read it in low pitch,
    with full, resonant chest tones. Then gradually raise the pitch,
    still obtaining the tones from the chest and uttering them with
    full resonance. 4. With such syllables as häh, you, now,
    man, war, hail, fool, practise in orotund voice the
    various exercises for pitch, concrete intervals, waves, stress,
    etc., previously suggested. 5. Read with feeling and appropriate
    intonations selected sentences from compositions of elevated or
    impassioned diction, as "Solomons's Prayer" (p. 35), "The Hymn"
    (p. 68), "France" (p. 205).

Of the various qualities (as they are called) of impure voice, the =Aspirate=, the =Sibilant=,
and the =Guttural= are defined with sufficient clearness, by their names. Though these modes
can be appropriately used only occasionally, nevertheless they are of great value to the reader,
and the voice should be trained to assume them whenever necessary. Great care must be exercised,
however, that impurities shall never be present as characteristics of normal utterance; this,
whether from the head or chest, should be distinct, sonorous, and smooth, and should exhaust
every particle of air expired.

Another impure quality is the =Pectoral=, which is an aspiration produced, as it were, from
the lowest cavities of the chest; and still another is the =Falsetto=, an unnatural voice,
that seems to be produced entirely in the upper cavities of the head. The employment of the
Falsetto at any time, either in speaking or reading, is of doubtful taste.

    EXERCISE.--1. With the syllable häh exemplify severally the
    aspirate, guttural, and pectoral qualities, first with
    insufficient vocality, then with sufficient. Exemplify the
    sibilant impurity with such syllables as pish, false,
    traitress, miscreant. In those exercises employ intervals of
    varying lengths, different degrees of initial pitch, and the
    several varieties of stress; and let the utterances be made
    effusively, expulsively, and explosively. 2. Select appropriate
    passages in "The Raven" (p. 258) for exercise in natural,
    orotund, aspirate, guttural, and pectoral qualities. Read the
    passages severally with appropriate intonations,--it may be
    somewhat exaggeratingly. Then read the whole poem feelingly,
    with appropriate, but not exaggerated intonations.

So far, what has been said has had reference mainly to the cultivation and improvement of the
voice, by the analogies and description of the various effective modes in which it can be manifested,
and by the suggestion of suitable exercises for increasing its endurance, strength, flexibility,
and resonance. It remains now to discuss shortly some of the principles of vocal interpretation,--that
is, to discuss what modes of voice-action are appropriate to the representation of the various
emotions which the wide range of literature presents to the reader.

It must be said in respect of principles that only broad and easily verifiable ones are of
use, and even these may be abused by a too rigorous adherence to them. The best rule that can
be given, as indeed it is founded on a principle of widest application, is that laid down in
the Fourth Reader:--To give a faithful sympathetic attention to the full meaning and sentiment
of what is read, and to manage the voice so as effectively to express this meaning and sentiment;
since this will always ensure a certain measure of appropriateness, if not the full perfection
of it. And it cannot be too much emphasized that even the fullest knowledge and most patient
study can establish for the reading of any selection, or passage, or sentence, none but general
directions, since the same words may very frequently be rendered in several ways, with differences
of pitch, time, stress, quality, implication, and so on, but with equal effectiveness and equal
appropriateness. And, on the other hand, any whole selection, even the simplest, is far too
complex in its thought and sentiment to be disposed of in one general analysis, which shall
predetermine the pitch, tone, and stress, and the prevailing width of the intervals, and the
direction of the inflections; all these will vary from paragraph to paragraph, and from sentence
to sentence, even from word to word. To sum up, it may be said that good reading demands as
indispensable, quick-witted intelligence, ready sympathy, and a voice so trained as to be flexible
and resonant; if the reader have this much endowment his reading will always be effective,
and, moreover, appropriate and impressive.

All diction may be roughly described as exhibiting one of three states of feeling: (1) that
in which feeling, as it is generally understood, is almost wanting; (2) that in which it is
present in some considerable degree; (3) that in which the feeling is present in an extreme
degree, dominating the ideas which the several sentences logically express. To the first division,
which may be called the =diction of discourse=, belongs all language indicative of a quiet
state of mind--formal statement, narrative, description, simple argument or reasoning: it is
the language of all ordinary writing. To the second division, which may be called the =diction
of sentiment or feeling=, belongs all language which indicates that the mind of the speaker,
real or supposed, is in a state of moderate excitement; that he is interested in the relation
of himself to others, and, consequently, in the effect of his utterances upon them; or that,
subjectively, he is interested in himself: it is the language of admiration, reverence, awe,
sincerity, dignity, of pathos, supplication, penitence. To the third division, which may be
called the =diction of passion=, belongs all language expressive of deeper excitement and more
vehement interest than that described as animating the diction of feeling: it is the language
of earnest or anxious interrogation, of passionate ejaculation, of powerful appeal, strong
accusation, and fierce denunciation; also, of contempt, derision, scorn, loathing, anger, hate,
and so on.

Voice, as we have seen, possesses five generic properties, pitch, force, quality, time, and
abruptness; and, in every spoken word, it must assume some mode of each of these properties,
manifesting them in co-existence. This conjoint mode, or vocal sign, as it is called, should
be the appropriate expression of the thought and feeling of which the word, in its place in
the sentence, is the graphical sign. Hence, as each word in a sentence may be said to have
its appropriate vocal sign, so each variety of diction may be said to have its appropriate
vocal expression,--a latitude of choice in the constituent modes, and a consequent indeterminateness
in the resulting expression, being, of course, always conceded.

The appropriate vocal expression for the diction of discourse may be said to consist of the
following modes:--normal pitch, simple intonations, and waves of a second, moderate force,
the equable concrete varied by slight radical stress, in quality the natural mode, in abruptness
sufficient sharpness of opening to effect clear articulation, and in time a moderate rate with
effusive utterance.

As the diction rises above this plain unimpassioned character, and becomes more and more informed
with feeling and sentiment, the constituent vocal signs, and hence the whole vocal expression,
become more and more expressive. In pitch there is frequent variation: in expressions of joy,
astonishment, or for command, the voice assumes naturally a somewhat higher elevation; and
with equal naturalness it descends below its normal level to utter the language of grave, solemn,
and reverential feeling. Again, inasmuch as the interval of the second is the plainest and
simplest within the command of the voice, in such diction as we are now considering, intervals
of a third, a fifth, or even an octave, may be heard, both in simple intonations and in waves.
Force, too, will not be unvaryingly applied, but will be greater or less according as energy
or passion may demand. In stress the equable concrete will give place to the radical or to
the final, to express energetic resolve; or, in the language of pathos, exaltation, reverence,
supplication, and so on, to the median--the most effective of all modes for the expression
of such deep feeling as is compatible with slow utterance. In time the rate of utterance will
vary with the syllabic quantities, these being short and crisp in the language of vivacious
conversation, but extended, and with distinct, attenuated vanishes, in grave and important
monologue. In quality, whenever the diction, departing from its simple character, becomes pervaded
by some deep emotion, the natural mode will give place to the orotund. And while effusive utterance
is always the prevalent mode, it will give place to the expulsive mode or to the explosive,
when energy of thought or force of passion requires it so.

Thus, as the diction rises from plain discourse to the language of feeling, the appropriate
vocal expression gathers intensity and becomes more varied, assumes, as may be said, brighter
colors and displays greater contrasts; and so, in the third class of diction, the diction of
passion, it displays its intensest and most vivid modes--its brightest colors, its deepest
contrasts.

As it is in a general sense only, that diction can be understood to be referrible to three
classes, so also, in a general sense only, can it be understood that any particular sentence
or passage has its appropriate vocal expression. All that is intended is simply this: an analysis
of the sentence, or passage, or selection, gives to the careful student a certain conception
of the quality and intensity of the feeling or passion that pervades it; this is to be interpreted,
as well as may be, by the most appropriate vocal signs possible--the whole constituting the
vocal expression suitable to the piece. In respect to its pervading emotion, the selection
will have what is called a =drift=, or general tendency, towards one of those states described
as characteristic of the diction of discourse, the diction of feeling, and the diction of passion,
respectively; and it is the business of the reader to watch for this drift, which of course
may vary from passage to passage, from sentence to sentence, and sometimes from word to word,
and to interpret it as best he may.

To indicate what modes of voice utterance are naturally most appropriate to the expression
of these various emotional states and drifts, it will be best to take up, one by one, the different
properties of the voice, and the several modes in which they are manifested, and to state briefly,
and in general terms, the emotional state or drift of which it is an appropriate expression.
(With respect to quality and abruptness this will be sufficiently done indirectly.) The student
then must for himself, if he wishes to apply these results to the reading of any selected passage,
first by analysis ascertain what are the emotional states which it involves, what are its prevailing
drifts, then in respect to each property of the voice choose the suitable mode for the interpretation
of these several states or drifts, conjoin the selected modes into appropriate vocal signs,
and with these form the vocal expression that suitably interprets the whole passage. The teacher,
or the teacher and student together, should select from the READER, or elsewhere, sentences
or passages that fitly exemplify the different modes; these should be written upon a black-board,
or in some other way preserved, and be referred to frequently for practice both in voice culture
and in vocal interpretation.

I. PITCH. Pitch must be considered under three heads: first, as referring to the prevailing
elevation of tone assumed by the voice in the reading of a whole sentence, passage, or selection,
called general or sentential pitch; second, as referring to the degree of elevation assumed
by the voice in the utterance of the opening, or radical, of any syllable, called initial or
radical pitch; third, as referring to the tone-width of the intervals in the utterance of the
syllable concrete.

=Sentential Pitch= in its various modes is descriptive of the general position in the scale
taken by the tones of the voice in uttering a sentence or passage. It may be spoken of as medium,
high, and low. =Medium Pitch= should correspond with the normal pitch of discourse previously
described. It is natural to the expression of all unimpassioned thought, and also of all emotions,
except the livelier, and the deeper and more intense. =High Pitch= and =Low Pitch= are only
relative terms. They do not represent fixed and definite modes of utterance; and all that can
be said is, that for the interpretation of what may be called the lighter feelings and emotions,
such as cheerfulness, joy, exultation, interest, and so on, also for the expression of raillery,
facetiousness, humorous conversation, laughter, and the like, sentential pitch of a degree
somewhat higher than normal pitch is appropriate; and, on the other hand, for the interpretation
of what may be called the graver and deeper feelings, such as awe, reverence, humility, grief,
and melancholy, and the more impassioned emotions, as disgust, loathing, horror, rage, despair,
as well as for the expression of all very serious and impressive thought, sentential pitch
of a degree somewhat lower than normal pitch is appropriate. The degree of elevation and depression
must be determined by the judgment and good taste of the reader; but it must be borne in mind
that this degree may vary from passage to passage, and from sentence to sentence, and even
from phrase to phrase.

In every style of diction, no matter how unimpassioned it may be, there will be frequent changes
in the train of thought, and frequent changes in the intensity of feeling; to represent these
changes there should be corresponding variations, or =transitions in sentential pitch=. These
transitions also serve another purpose, namely, to indicate an interpolated or parenthetical
idea. In making transitions the voice follows the general law of all vocal interpretation;
strong contrasts in thought and feeling are marked by transitions of wide intervals, and lesser
contrasts by lesser intervals.

Transitions in pitch are naturally accompanied by corresponding changes in force, rate of utterance,
and phrasing; and, like all other modes of expression, these receive their color from the intensity
of thought and feeling of which they are the symbols. For example, in the rendering of a parenthetical
clause (since, as a rule, the thought expressed in the parenthesis is of less gravity than
the thought in the main sentence), the voice will manifest itself in lighter force and generally
in quicker movement, that is, in lighter, less contrasting colors; but whether the pitch be
raised or lowered depends upon the sentential pitch appropriate to the main sentence,--it should
be in contrast with that. And it may be remarked in passing, that the reading of the parenthesis
should end with a phrase melody similar to that appropriate to the words immediately before
the parenthesis, so that the ear may naturally be carried back to the proper place in the main
clause for the continuation of the expression of the principal thought.

=Radical Pitch=, that is the pitch with which the opening of a syllable is uttered, is, in
respect of appropriate employment, the most important element of reading or speaking; but all
that can be done here, is to call attention to this, and leave the student to exercise his
taste and judgment in regard to its use. The importance of appropriately varying radical pitch
so as to impart melody to continued utterance will be seen at once if a simple sentence (for
example, "Tom and Jim sat on a log") be read, first in that monotonous voice (that is, with
unvarying radical pitch) so often heard in the labored reading of improperly taught young children,
and then with those appropriate intonations heard in animated colloquy. When properly rendered,
even if read with but little animation, each syllable, or concrete, passes through an interval
of a second, and the several syllables are discretely uttered; but the radical pitch varies
from syllable to syllable, forming a diatonic melody. For the rendering of any given sentence
in appropriate diatonic melody, positive direction as to the order of succession in respect
of radical pitch cannot be given; the same words may be uttered with equal appropriateness
in many varieties of melody. The ignoring of this fact has led to the most absurd pretensions.

A group of two or three syllabic concretes is called a =phrase of melody=; and as phrases vary
with respect to pitch, in the order of succession of the radicals of their constituent syllables,
they receive different names: such as the monotone, in which the radicals are all on the same
pitch; and the ditone and the tritone, groups of two tones and three tones respectively, with
radicals of different pitch; and, again, the concretes in these phrases may have upward or
downward intonations: but fixed rules cannot be laid down for their use. The reader must bear
in mind, however, that it is upon the tasteful use of phrases and cadences, that is, upon the
tasteful employment of variation in radical pitch, that the melody of uttered language depends;
and that if it be devoid of this melody, it is both wearisome and unimpressive to the hearer.

The intonations of the voice must necessarily be through either rising intervals or falling
intervals, and there is a generic difference in the meaning of these. =The rising interval=
is heard naturally at the end of a direct question; that is, one to which "yes" or "no" is
an expected answer, as "Are you going home?" The suspensive tone which the voice assumes at
the end of the interrogation is indicative of incompleteness of thought; and indication of
incompleteness is the characteristic function of all rising intervals.

=The falling interval= is heard naturally at the close of a complete statement, as "I am here";
and hence, words indicating completeness, positiveness, resolution, are appropriately uttered
with downward intervals. In effecting a downward intonation the voice operates in one of two
ways: either the weaker mode, in which it descends from a radical pitch at or near the current
tone to a lower pitch; or the stronger mode, in which it assumes discretely a radical pitch
as much above the current tone as the emphasis requires, and descends concretely either to
the current tone or below it.

As every sentence is more or less incomplete until the end is reached, rising intervals are
the rule in intonation, and falling intervals the exception, and it is this infrequency of
use which gives to the falling movement its value as a mode of emphasis. But where the emphasis
is that of doubt, uncertainty, surprise, or interrogation, the suspensiveness of these emotional
states is appropriately expressed by rising intonations; and hence, too, in all sentences in
which the interrogative element is strongly present, the rising interval should characterize
every syllable in it, and the sentences be uttered with interrogative intonations throughout.
If in any such sentence, a particular word is to be especially emphasized, this is effected
by giving to the word a low radical pitch and retaining the rising interval indicative of interrogation.

=The width of the interval= depends, as is natural, upon the intensity of the thought or emotion
of which the concrete is intended to be an expression. For example, suppose the statement,
"=You= are the culprit," be answered by the surprised and indignant interrogation, "=I?=" The
emphatic words here used may be appropriately uttered with intervals of a tone, a third, a
fifth, or an octave, according to the emphasis supposed necessary.

=The Semitone=, as has been said before, is an interval sometimes heard in language of distress,
complaint, grief, sorrow, tenderness, compassion, pity. Occasionally it is introduced in diatonic
melody as an appropriate emphatic mode of uttering a single word; as, for example, "Other friends
have flown before; on the morrow HE will leave me." At times diction may assume what may be
called a pathetic drift, and for the suitable interpretation of this drift semitonic intervals
may be used, and the mode of progression cease for a space to be diatonic and become semitonic,
or chromatic, as it is called.

=The Wave= is one of the most impressive of the elements of expression; but its proper use
demands great flexibility in the vocal organs and a high degree of taste in the reader. Like
all other unusual modes, its employment lends color and contrast to utterance; that is, it
makes it more effective for the purposes of emphasis or distinction. The wave, as has been
described, is a concrete with an upward and a downward movement united; but its last constituent
is that which most affects the ear and leaves upon it the stronger impression, and hence, especially
if it be given with a wide interval, its dominant characteristic will be that of the second
movement; for example, if the second movement be upward, the wave may express interrogation
mingled with surprise or scorn; if the second movement be downward, the wave may express astonishment
mingled with indignation. The intervals which are given to the wave depend upon the diction
to which it is applied. To express great surprise or vehement indignation it may sweep through
a fifth or a whole octave. In these extreme modes the wave frequently is given a wider interval
in the second movement than in the first, and its effect intensified by the appropriate use
of stress, and (for the expression of such emotions as scorn, contempt, irony, ridicule, and
so on) of the impure qualities of voice. When used with intervals of the second, the characteristics
of direct and inverted forms lose some of their distinctness; but in this degree the wave is
effectively used to put into relief occasional words, or, with median stress and long quantities,
to give to the otherwise short and tripping character of the second a dignified and impressive
effect suited to the rendering of all serious and important diction that is not impassioned.

=The Wave of the Semitone= is generally employed when time, or syllabic quantity, is needed
as an element in the expression of the language of complaint or pathos. The effect is much
the same whether it be direct or indirect.

=The Tremor= may be used to express grief, supplication, tenderness, in which the interval
through which it ranges may be wide, or, for a more plaintive effect, be limited to the semitone.
With constituent intervals other than the semitone (that is, of a tone or otherwise), and ranging
through an aggregate interval of less or greater width, it may be used to express laughter;
as, for example, in the utterance of the syllables "ha, ha, ha, ha, ha," which, when rapidly
effected, resembles one syllable uttered with discrete intervals. Combined with stress, aspiration,
and guttural vibration, in suitable modifications, this laughing tone may be made to express
scorn, derision, exultation, triumph, and so on.

II. FORCE. Force must be considered under two aspects: first, as to the degree of its intensity
in the utterance of syllables, words, phrases, and sentences; and second, as to the form of
its application in the utterance of the concrete. When the term is used without qualification,
the first of these considerations is intended; when the second is intended, force is generally
spoken of as =stress=.

Force must be contradistinguished from loudness. In mere loudness the vocal organs are comparatively
relaxed--the intensity of sound being produced by the violent discharge of a great volume of
air from the lungs. In forceful utterance the vocal organs are compressed and tense, and though
the volume of air effused be small, the resulting sound-vibrations are strong, and distinct,
and of penetrating power.

In respect of intensity, force may be manifested in infinite variation, but the degrees usually
spoken of are very light, light, moderate, strong, and very strong. As with all other modes,
these degrees will vary from word to word, and from sentence to sentence; and great judgment
and taste must be exercised in employing them, so that they appropriately represent the intensity
of the thought and feeling of which they are to be the expression.

=Moderate Force= is the natural expression of tranquillity, and, therefore, of all unimpassioned
diction. As the diction becomes pervaded by the more positive emotions, the tones of the voice
naturally become stronger. Certainty requires strong force with pure quality. So all the passions,
the lighter as well as the more vehement, require the degree of force to be heightened: cheerfulness,
joy, ecstacy, requiring force moderately strong; and anger, hate, terror, revenge, being suitably
rendered by very strong force. Again, doubt, uncertainty, secrecy, as well as the gentler and
more plaintive emotions, are most suitably represented by the lighter shades of force.

As the voice assumes the intenser modes of force, the vocal organs become more and more compressed,
and utterance is more and more labored; the breath forced out cannot all be vocalized; the
voice becomes less and less pure, and manifests itself in the aspirate and guttural qualities.
Hence, strongly suppressed utterance in impure vocality, rather than mere loudness in pure
vocality, is the appropriate expression for all the intenser passions.

III. STRESS. Stress is force considered with respect of the form of its application to the
concrete. Since the equable concrete is the natural colorless expression of unimpassioned thought,
force applied to any part of it changes its character, and gives it a more or less significant
emphasis. The three most usual forms of stress are the radical, the median, and the final;
these may be effected in any of the degrees of force. Compound stress and thorough stress admit
of but little variation.

=Radical Stress=, to some extent an essential, but not an expressive element in the equable
concrete, is, in a somewhat stronger form, an element in all utterance that is intended to
be vivid and energetic, emphasizing these characteristics by its own incisive clearness. The
more animated and energetic the diction the clearer and more determined should be the opening
of the concrete, that is, the more distinct and forcible should be its radical stress; while
in graver language the radical stress is less pronounced. In its emphatic degree it ought at
no time to be allowed to become a current mode, imparting its peculiar incisive character to
every syllable; though, for especial emphasis, it may be appropriately used in this way in
the utterance of the several words of a phrase.

=Final Stress= differs from radical stress principally in this, that while it equally indicates
energy and positiveness, it does so as in accordance with predetermination and reflection.
Radical stress denotes, as it were, an involuntary state of energy; final stress, the energy
or fixedness of resolve. Hence, final stress is appropriate to the expression of resolution,
of obstinacy, of earnest conviction, of passionate resolve. It emphasizes the characteristics
of wide intervals, giving to rising intonations a more decidedly interrogatory character, and
making falling intonations more vehemently and passionately positive.

=Median Stress=, as it can be effectively applied to none but indefinite or mutable syllables,
is compatible only with such a rate of utterance as will permit of these receiving long quantities.
It may receive any degree of force, from that gentle swell which indicates a tranquil flow
of emotion, to that firm and swelling energy which is the appropriate expression of the language
of elevated feeling. With the wider intervals it should be used only for occasional emphasis;
but in its lighter forms it may prevail as a drift of dignified expression. Median stress,
being always necessarily associated with long quantity in syllables, is not an appropriate
mode in the language of colloquy, or in vivacious discourse of any kind. It is, however, the
fit interpreter of that fervid and lofty imagination which clothes itself in forms of grace
and grandeur; and hence, with intonations and waves of the lesser intervals, with medium or
low sentential pitch, a moderate degree of force, and the pure or orotund quality, it is the
appropriate expression of all exalted prose and poetry, not strongly dramatic.

=Thorough Stress= is effected by continuing the force and fulness of the radical stress throughout
the whole concrete. Used as a current mode, which should be but rarely, it is expressive of
bluntness, arrogance, bravado; and, with short quantities, of ignorant coarseness. Occasionally
it may be used instead of final stress to give emphasis to a syllable whose vanishing movement
is but little capable of receiving an increase of force.

=Compound Stress= combines the qualities of both radical and final stress; it is therefore
of extreme character, and can be only occasionally used. With wide intervals, in its stronger
modes, it is expressive of the utmost intensity of feeling; in its lighter modes it is the
natural expression of strong surprise.

=The Loud Concrete= is simply the equable concrete uttered with greater fulness of breath and
loudness of tone. It is used to break a current of light force for the sake of emphasizing
some word or phrase; and, in impassioned discourse, it may be used as a current mode, individual
words or phrases being then put in relief by receiving the forcible radical, or thorough, or
compound stress.

In reference to stress it must be remembered that, as with all other varieties of emphatic
utterance, no one form should prevail as an exclusive mode. Even a prevalent drift of thought
or feeling will be most effectively rendered by vocal signs which change in color and intensity
from word to word. It must also be borne in mind in reference both to force and stress, and
to pitch and time as well, that the modes which are employed must sustain a suitable relation
to the situation and surroundings of the speaker. Where considerable space has to be filled
and distance overcome, the energy of utterance should be correspondingly intense; but for great
distances, what is called =level speaking= is the only effectual mode,--that is, speaking exclusively
in those tones of normal pitch in which the voice has most penetrating power, with force of
almost constant intensity, and in a somewhat slow movement with long syllabic quantities, but
of course with as much needful variation of expression as is possible within these limits.

IV. TIME. Time is rate of utterance. It comprehends quantity, or rate considered in reference
to the duration of individual syllables; and movement, or rate considered in reference to the
utterance of syllables and words in succession. With it may be considered pauses, or cessations
of the voice, helpful in the expression of thought and feeling, and necessary to the working
of the vocal mechanism.

=Quantity=, as defined above, is an arbitrary thing, dependent almost entirely upon the will
of the speaker. But many words and syllables are more expressive of their meaning when, in
uttering them, the voice is somewhat prolonged,--hence quantity is an element of expression.
Again, many words and syllables can receive this prolongation of utterance more readily than
others,--hence quantity is a natural element of spoken language. As indefinite syllables are
much more capable of prolongation than mutable or immutable syllables, they are said to possess
long quantity, or, more shortly, "to possess quantity"; mutable syllables possess quantity
in a less degree, and immutable syllables are naturally deficient in quantity.

As an element of expression, quantity (that is, long quantity) lends dignity and grace to the
movement of the voice, and affords ground for the display of those expressive modes of vocal
action which are incompatible with the rapid or ejaculatory utterance of the concrete; and
hence, with median stress, the wave, moderate intervals, medium or low sentential pitch, it
is used as naturally interpretative of solemnity, reverence, awe, deep pathos, ardent admiration,
and all elevated emotion. Colloquial tones, excited argument, wit, raillery, and all the lighter
emotions, require for their expression, brilliancy rather than grace, and so are more fittingly
interpreted by short quantities and radical stress.

The discerning reader, in his work of vocal interpretation, will not fail to take advantage
of the inherent character of syllables with respect to quantity. Our language abounds in indefinite
syllables to which he may impart whatever quantity he may desire. On the other hand, immutable
syllables, while not admitting the wave and the median stress, are eminently fitted to receive
the more forcible forms of radical stress; and mutable syllables, with their abrupt closes,
permit of perfect exemplifications of thorough and final stress.

=Movement=, though it depends for its slower and more expressive forms upon the capacities
of syllables for the reception of long quantities, is, in its more rapid forms, quite independent
of syllabic structure, and dependent only on the will of the speaker; hence it may be spoken
of as being altogether under his control. A medium rate of utterance is, with respect to time,
the natural expression of an equable flow of thought. The livelier emotions should be indicated
by quicker rates, and hence, cheerfulness, joy, vivacious dialogue, animated narration, naturally
find their expression in movements more or less brisk, with short quantities, varied intonations,
and pitch higher than the normal; the more vehement emotions, eagerness, anger, excited anxiety,
demand simply heightened forms of these modes. Contrariwise, thought of grave and meditative
character, admiration, reverence, and all the deeper and calmer feelings, require a deliberative,
slow-timed utterance, with long quantities for accented syllables, and extended time for even
unaccented syllables. As these serious emotions become stronger and deeper, the syllabic quantities
become proportionately longer, and with impressive median swells, orotund quality, low pitch,
waves and simple intonations of the second, frequent phrases in monotone, and an occasional
tremor, constitute the most impressive utterance of adoration.

Occasionally an abrupt change in quantity, or movement, may be employed as a mode of emphasis,
either positive or negative; for example, in a current of rapid movement, a word may be put
into strong relief by being uttered with quantity much extended; contrariwise, a parenthetical
or explanatory phrase is usually touched upon lightly and with a more rapid movement than that
of the current in which it is found.

=Pause= may be used as an element in the expression of thought simply, that is, as a help to
the interpretation of the mere sense of the words read; or, more emphatically, as an element
in the expression of feeling and emotion. As interpretative of thought, pauses should correspond
mainly with the graphical marks of punctuation. Two things, however, must be borne in mind:
first, the use of punctuation marks in writing and in printing is always more or less an arbitrary
matter, scarcely any two authors agreeing in their employment of them; and therefore the reader's
own good sense must be to him his principal authority as to the closeness with which he follows
them: and second, pauses are to an auditor what punctuation marks are intended to be to a reader;
but, whereas the eye may constantly keep within its vision the relation of each word uttered,
both to those which preceded it and to those which are to follow, the ear hears the words that
are read only ictus by ictus, stroke by stroke, and therefore can not aid the mind to grasp
this relation--the memory alone helping to do that; and hence, in reading, pauses should be
more frequent, and perhaps more prolonged, than the punctuation marks might seem to necessitate.
The reader should also bear in mind that even the plainest and simplest diction, or that requiring
the most rapid utterance, may be so marked by appropriate pauses that those stoppages of the
voice necessarily required for inspiration, shall never occur except when they assist to interpret
the sense,--they must not interrupt it.

As interpretative of emotion pauses do not necessarily correspond to grammatical structure;
but, as with all the modes of expression previously considered, their frequency and length--their
only modifications--must harmonize with the feeling which they are to assist in interpreting.
In length, for example, they should correspond with the movement of which they may be said
to form a part; when the movement is slow, as in the expression of awe, reverence, and the
like, they are naturally long; in the brisk movement required to interpret the livelier emotions,
they should be short. As a mode of emphasis pause serves to fix the attention of the hearer,--either
backward upon a word or phrase, that the mind may dwell upon it, or forward to awaken curiosity
and expectation: it is evident then that a frequent use of it for this purpose would destroy
its value.

Pauses may be used in reading to simulate an appropriate labor of utterance, as when the mind
is supposed to be overcome by sorrow, or disturbed by anger. At such times also, they serve
as fit rests for the voice in its efforts to express the disturbed condition of the mind, and
as appropriate avenues for the escape of emotion otherwise than by vocality, as by sibling.
Pauses should be used also to indicate sudden transitions from one state of caution to another.

I. KING SOLOMON'S PRAYER AND BLESSING AT THE DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE.

From THE FIRST BOOK OF KINGS.

Translated 1611--Revised 1885.

Then spake Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. I have surely
built thee an house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever. And the king turned
his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel
stood. But the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house
for my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart: nevertheless thou shalt not build
the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for
my name. Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that
which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on
the throne of Israel; if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou
hast walked before me. And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people
Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place:
and when thou hearest, forgive. When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because
they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and
make supplication unto thee in this house: then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of
thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they
pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict
them: then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel,
when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land,
which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. Moreover concerning the stranger, that
is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name's sake; (for
they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy stretched out arm:) when
he shall come and pray toward this house; hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according
to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy
name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which
I have built is called by thy name. If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by
whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou
hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: then hear thou in heaven
their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. For thou didst separate them
from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand
of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.

II. INVITATION.

From ISAIAH.

Translated 1611--Revised 1885.

Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy,
and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend
money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently
unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

III. THE TRIAL SCENE IN THE "MERCHANT OF VENICE."[A]

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.--1564-1616.

Scene--A Court of Justice. Present--THE DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO,
SOLANIO, and others.

Duke. What, is Antonio here?

Antonio. Ready, so please your grace.

Duke. I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable
of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.

Antonio.         I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course;
but since he stands obdurate, And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach,
I do oppose My patience to his fury; and am arm'd To suffer, with a quietness of spirit, The
very tyranny and rage of his.

Duke. Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

Solanio. He's ready at the door: he comes, my lord.

Enter SHYLOCK.

Duke. Make room, and let him stand before our face.-- Shylock, the world thinks, and I think
so too, That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act; and then
'tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange Than is thy strange apparent
cruelty; And where thou now exact'st the penalty,-- Which is a pound of this poor merchant's
flesh,-- Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal; Glancing an eye of pity on his losses, That have of late
so huddled on his back, Enough to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his
state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint, From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never
train'd To offices of tender courtesy. We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

Shylock. I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose; And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond: If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter
and your city's freedom. You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh
than to receive Three thousand ducats; I'll not answer that; But, say, it is my humor; is it
answer'd? What if my house be troubled with a rat, And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats
To have it ban'd? What, are you answer'd yet? Some men there are love not a gaping pig; Some,
that are mad if they behold a cat; And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose, Cannot contain
themselves: for affection, Master of passion, sways it to the mood Of what it likes, or loathes.
Now, for your answer: As there is no firm reason to be render'd, Why he cannot abide a gaping
pig; Why he, a harmless necessary cat; Why he, a woollen bagpipe,--but of force Must yield
to such inevitable shame As to offend, himself being offended; So can I give no reason, nor
I will not, More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

Bassanio. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

Shylock. I am not bound to please thee with my answer.

Bassanio. Do all men kill the things they do not love?

Shylock. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

Bassanio. Every offence is not a hate at first.

Shylock. What, would'st thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

Antonio. I pray you, think you question with the Jew. You may as well go stand upon the beach,
And bid the main flood bate his usual height; You may as well use question with the wolf, Why
he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb; You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their
high tops, and to make no noise, When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven; You may as
well do anything most hard, As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?-- His Jewish
heart: therefore, I do beseech you, Make no more offers, use no further means, But, with all
brief and plain conveniency, Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.

Bassanio. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

Shylock. If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, I
would not draw them; I would have my bond.

Duke. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?

Shylock. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? You have among you many a purchas'd slave,
Which, like your asses, and your dogs, and mules, You use in abject and in slavish parts, Because
you bought them: shall I say to you, Let them be free, marry them to your heirs? Why sweat
they under burdens? let their beds Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates Be season'd
with such viands? You will answer, "The slaves are ours:" so do I answer you: The pound of
flesh, which I demand of him, Is dearly bought; 'tis mine, and I will have it: If you deny
me, fie upon your law! There is no force in the decrees of Venice. I stand for judgment: answer;
shall I have it?

Duke. Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor, Whom I have
sent for to determine this, Come here to-day.

Solanio.        My lord, here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor, New come
from Padua.

Duke. Bring us the letters; call the messenger.

Bassanio. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet! The Jew shall have my flesh, blood,
bones, and all, Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

Antonio. I am a tainted wether of the flock, Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit Drops
earliest to the ground, and so let me: You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio, Than to live
still, and write mine epitaph.

Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk.

Duke. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

Nerissa. From both, my lord: Bellario greets your grace.

[Presents a letter.

Bassanio. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

Shylock. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

Gratiano. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal
can, No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce
thee?

Shylock. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

Gratiano. O, be thou damn'd, inexorable dog! And for thy life let justice be accus'd. Thou
almost mak'st me waver in my faith, To hold opinion with Pythagoras, That souls of animals
infuse themselves Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for
human slaughter, Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, And, whilst thou lay'st in
thy unhallow'd dam, Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd, and
ravenous.

Shylock. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak
so loud: Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
Duke. This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learnèd doctor to our court:-- Where
is he?

Nerissa. He attendeth here hard by, To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.

Duke. With all my heart.--Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place.--
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

[Clerk reads.] Your grace shall understand, that, at the receipt of your letter, I am very
sick: but, in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young
doctor of Rome; his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er many books together: he is furnished with
my opinion: which, bettered with his own learning, the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend,
comes with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's request in my stead. I beseech you,
let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation; for I never knew
so young a body with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall
better publish his commendation.

Duke. You hear the learned Bellario, what he writes: And here, I take it, is the doctor come.--

Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws.

Give me your hand: came you from old Bellario?

Portia. I did, my lord.

Duke.                   You are welcome; take your place. Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?

Portia. I am informèd, throughly of the cause. Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?

Duke. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

Portia. Is your name Shylock?

Shylock.                      Shylock is my name.

Portia. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow; Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.-- You stand within his danger, do you not?      [To ANTONIO.

Antonio. Ay, so he says.

Portia.                  Do you confess the bond?

Antonio. I do.

Portia.        Then must the Jew be merciful.

Shylock. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.

Portia. The quality of mercy is not strain'd; It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon
the place beneath: it is twice bless'd; It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes: 'Tis
mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes The thronèd monarch better than his crown; His sceptre
shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread
and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway; It is enthronèd in the hearts of
kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God's When
mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this,-- That, in
the course of justice, none of us Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; And that same
prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much To mitigate the
justice of thy plea; Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence
'gainst the merchant there.

Shylock. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

Portia. Is he not able to discharge the money?

Bassanio. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court; Yea, twice the sum: if that will not
suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest
once the law to your authority: To do a great right, do a little wrong; And curb this cruel
devil of his will.

Portia. It must not be; there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree establishèd: 'Twill
be recorded for a precedent; And many an error, by the same example, Will rush into the state.
It cannot be.

Shylock. A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how do I honour thee!

Portia. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

Shylock. Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

Portia. Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.

Shylock. An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven: Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No,
not for Venice.

Portia.           Why, this bond is forfeit; And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound
of flesh, to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant's heart.--Be merciful; Take thrice thy
money; bid me tear the bond.

Shylock. When it is paid according to the tenor. It doth appear you are a worthy judge; You
know the law, your exposition Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law, Whereof you are
a well-deserving pillar, Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue
of man To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

Antonio. Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment.

Portia.             Why, then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife;--

Shylock. O noble judge! O excellent young man!

Portia.--For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here
appeareth due upon the bond.

Shylock. 'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge! How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

Portia. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.

Shylock.                                Ay, his breast: So says the bond:--doth it not, noble
judge?-- "Nearest his heart:" those are the very words.

Portia. It is so. Are there balance here, to weigh The flesh?

Shylock. I have them ready.

Portia. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed
to death.

Shylock. Is it so nominated in the bond?

Portia. It is not so express'd; but what of that? 'Twere good you do so much for charity.

Shylock. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.

Portia. Come, merchant, have you anything to say?

Antonio. But little: I am arm'd, and well prepar'd.-- Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you
well! Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you; For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view
with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty; from which lingering penance Of such a
misery doth she cut me off. Commend me to your honorable wife: Tell her the process of Antonio's
end; Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death; And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent not you that you shall lose your friend, And he
repents not that he pays your debt; For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I'll pay it instantly
with all my heart.

Bassanio. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself; But life itself,
my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem'd above thy life: I would lose all, ay,
sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to deliver you.

Portia. Your wife would give you little thanks for that, If she were by, to hear you make the
offer.

Gratiano. I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love: I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

Nerissa. 'Tis well you offer it behind her back; The wish would make else an unquiet house.

Shylock. [Aside.] These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter; Would any of the stock
of Bárrabas Had been her husband rather than a Christian!-- [To PORTIA.] We trifle time; I
pray thee, pursue sentence.

Portia. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine: The court awards it, and the law doth
give it.

Shylock. Most rightful judge!

Portia. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast: The law allows it, and the court awards
it.

Shylock. Most learnèd judge! A sentence!--Come, prepare.

Portia. Tarry a little; there is something else. This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are "a pound of flesh": Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate Unto the state of Venice.

Gratiano. O upright judge!--Mark, Jew:--O learnèd judge!

Shylock. Is that the law?

Portia.                   Thyself shalt see the act: For, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.

Gratiano. O learnèd judge!--Mark, Jew:--a learnèd judge!

Shylock. I take this offer, then: pay the bond thrice, And let the Christian go.

Bassanio.               Here is the money.

Portia. Soft! The Jew shall have all justice;--soft! no haste:-- He shall have nothing but
the penalty.

Gratiano. O Jew! an upright judge, a learnèd judge!

Portia. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less
nor more But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more Or less than a just pound,--be it but
so much As makes it light, or heavy, in the substance, Or the division of the twentieth part,
Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair,-- Thou diest,
and all thy goods are confiscate.

Gratiano. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew! Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip.

Portia. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.

Shylock. Give me my principal, and let me go.

Bassanio. I have it ready for thee; here it is.

Portia. He hath refus'd it in the open court: He shall have merely justice, and his bond.

Gratiano. A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel!-- I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

Shylock. Shall I not have barely my principal?

Portia. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture, To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

Shylock. Why, then the devil give him good of it! I'll stay no longer question.

Portia.                     Tarry, Jew: The law hath yet another hold on you. It is enacted
in the laws of Venice, If it be prov'd against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one
half his goods; the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state; And the offender's life
lies in the mercy Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice. In which predicament, I say, thou
stand'st; For it appears, by manifest proceeding, That, indirectly, and directly too, Thou
hast contriv'd against the very life Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd The danger formerly
by me rehears'd. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.

Gratiano. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself: And yet, thy wealth being forfeit
to the state, Thou hast not left the value of a cord; Therefore, thou must be hang'd at the
state's charge.

Duke. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, I pardon thee thy life before thou
ask it: For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's; The other half comes to the general state, Which
humbleness may drive unto a fine.

Portia. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.

Shylock. Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that: You take my house when you do take the
prop That doth sustain my house; you take my life, When you do take the means whereby I live.

Portia. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

Gratiano. A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.

Antonio. So please my lord the duke, and all the court, To quit the fine for one half of his
goods, I am content, so he will let me have The other half in use, to render it, Upon his death,
unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter: Two things provided more,--that, for this
favor, He presently become a Christian; The other, that he do record a gift, Here in the court,
of all he dies possess'd, Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

Duke. He shall do this; or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronouncèd here.

Portia. Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?

Shylock. I am content.

Portia.                Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

Shylock. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence; I am not well: send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.

Duke.             Get thee gone, but do it.

Gratiano. In christening thou shalt have two godfathers; Had I been judge, thou should'st have
had ten more, To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.      [Exit Shylock.

Duke. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

Portia. I humbly do desire your grace of pardon: I must away this night toward Padua, And it
is meet I presently set forth.

Duke. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. Antonio, gratify this gentleman, For, in
my mind, you are much bound to him.

[Exeunt omnes.

IV. OF BOLDNESS.

LORD BACON.--1561-1626.

From ESSAYS.

It is a trivial grammar-school text, but yet worthy a wise man's consideration: question was
asked of Demosthenes, what was the chief part of an orator? He answered, action: what next?
action: what next again? action. He said it that knew it best, and had by nature himself no
advantage in that he commended. A strange thing, that that part of an orator which is but superficial,
and rather the virtue of a player, should be placed so high above those other noble parts,
of invention, elocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it were all in all. But the
reason is plain. There is in human nature generally more of the fool than of the wise; and
therefore those faculties by which the foolish part of men's minds is taken, are most potent.
Wonderful like is the case of boldness in civil business; what first? boldness: what second
and third? boldness. And yet boldness is a child of ignorance and baseness, far inferior to
other parts: but, nevertheless, it doth fascinate, and bind hand and foot those that are either
shallow in judgment or weak in courage, which are the greatest part; yea, and prevaileth with
wise men at weak times; therefore we see it hath done wonders in popular states, but with senates
and princes less; and more, ever upon the first entrance of bold persons into action, than
soon after; for boldness is an ill keeper of promise. Surely, as there are mountebanks for
the natural body, so are there mountebanks for the politic body--men that undertake great cures,
and perhaps have been lucky in two or three experiments, but want the grounds of science, and
therefore cannot hold out. Nay, you shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet's miracle.
Mahomet made the people believe that he would call a hill to him, and from the top of it offer
up his prayers for the observers of his law. The people assembled: Mahomet called the hill
to come to him again and again; and when the hill stood still, he was never a whit abashed,
but said, "If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet will go to the hill." So these men,
when they have promised great matters, and failed most shamefully, yet, if they have the perfection
of boldness, they will but slight it over, and make a turn, and no more ado. Certainly, to
men of great judgment, bold persons are sport to behold; nay, and to the vulgar also boldness
hath somewhat of the ridiculous: for, if absurdity be the subject of laughter, doubt you not
but great boldness is seldom without some absurdity; especially it is a sport to see when a
bold fellow is out of countenance, for that puts his face into a most shrunken and wooden posture,
as needs it must--for in bashfulness the spirits do a little go and come--but with bold men,
upon like occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at chess, where it is no mate, but yet
the game cannot stir: but this last were fitter for a satire than for a serious observation.
This is well to be weighed, that boldness is ever blind, for it seeth not dangers and inconveniences:
therefore it is ill in counsel, good in execution; so that the right use of bold persons is,
that they never command in chief, but be seconds, and under the direction of others; for in
counsel it is good to see dangers, and in execution not to see them, except they be very great.

       *       *       *       *       *

    He that cannot see well, let him go softly.

        BACON.

V. TO DAFFODILS.

ROBERT HERRICK.--1594-1674.

    Fair Daffodils, we weep to see
      You haste away so soon;
    As yet the early-rising sun
      Has not attain'd his noon.
                  Stay, stay,
          Until the hasting day
                  Has run
          But to the even-song;
    And, having pray'd together, we
          Will go with you along.

    We have short time to stay, as you;
      We have as short a spring;
    As quick a growth to meet decay,
      As you, or anything.
                  We die
          As your hours do, and dry
                  Away,
      Like to the summer's rain;
    Or as the pearls of morning's dew,
          Ne'er to be found again.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Stone walls do not a prison make,
      Nor iron bars a cage;
    Minds innocent and quiet take
    That for a hermitage:
    If I have freedom in my love,
      And in my soul am free,
    Angels alone, that soar above,
      Enjoy such liberty.

        RICHARD LOVELACE.--1618-1658.

VI. OF CONTENTEDNESS IN ALL ESTATES AND ACCIDENTS.

JEREMY TAYLOR.--1613-1667.

From HOLY LIVING.

Virtues and discourses are, like friends, necessary in all fortunes; but those are the best,
which are friends in our sadnesses, and support us in our sorrows and sad accidents: and in
this sense, no man that is virtuous can be friendless; nor hath any man reason to complain
of the Divine Providence, or accuse the public disorder of things, or in his own infelicity,
since God hath appointed one remedy for all the evils in the world, and that is a contented
spirit: for this alone makes a man pass through fire, and not be scorched; through seas, and
not be drowned; through hunger and nakedness, and want nothing. For since all the evil in the
world consists in the disagreeing between the object and the appetite, as when a man hath what
he desires not, or desires what he hath not, or desires amiss; he that composes his spirit
to the present accident, hath variety of instances for his virtue, but none to trouble him,
because his desires enlarge not beyond his present fortune: and a wise man is placed in the
variety of chances, like the nave or centre of a wheel, in the midst of all the circumvolutions
and changes of posture, without violence or change, save that it turns gently in compliance
with its changed parts, and is indifferent which part is up, and which is down; for there is
some virtue or other to be exercised, whatever happens, either patience or thanksgiving, love
or fear, moderation or humility, charity or contentedness, and they are every one of them equally
in order to his great end and immortal felicity: and beauty is not made by white or red, by
black eyes and a round face, by a straight body and a smooth skin; but by a proportion to the
fancy. No rules can make amiability; our minds and apprehensions make that: and so is our felicity;
and we may be reconciled to poverty and a low fortune, if we suffer contentedness and the grace
of God to make the proportions. For no man is poor that does not think himself so: but if,
in a full fortune, with impatience he desires more, he proclaims his wants and his beggarly
condition. But because this grace of contentedness was the sum of all the old moral philosophy,
and a great duty in Christianity, and of most universal use in the whole course of our lives,
and the only instrument to ease the burdens of the world and the enmities of sad chances, it
will not be amiss to press it by the proper arguments by which God hath bound it upon our spirits;
it being fastened by reason and religion, by duty and interest, by necessity and conveniency,
by example, and by the proposition of excellent rewards, no less than peace and felicity.

Contentedness in all estates is a duty of religion; it is the great reasonableness of complying
with the Divine Providence, which governs all the world, and hath so ordered us in the administration
of his great family. He were a strange fool that should be angry because dogs and sheep need
no shoes, and yet himself is full of care to get some. God hath supplied those needs to them
by natural provisions, and to thee by an artificial: for he hath given thee reason to learn
a trade, or some means to make or buy them, so that it only differs in the manner of our provision:
and which had you rather want, shoes or reason? and my patron, that hath given me a farm, is
freer to me than if he gives a loaf ready baked. But, however, all these gifts come from him,
and therefore it is fit he should dispense them as he pleases; and if we murmur here, we may,
at the next melancholy, be troubled that God did not make us to be angels or stars. For if
that which we are or have do not content us, we may be troubled for every thing in the world
which is beside our being or our possessions.

God is the master of the scenes; we must not choose which part we shall act; it concerns us
only to be careful that we do it well, always saying, "If this please God, let it be as it
is:" and we, who pray that God's will may be done in earth as it is in heaven, must remember
that the angels do whatsoever is commanded them, and go wherever they are sent, and refuse
no circumstances; and if their employment be crossed by a higher decree, they sit down in peace,
and rejoice in the event; and when the angel of Judea could not prevail in behalf of the people
committed to his charge, because the angel of Persia opposed it, he only told the story at
the command of God, and was as content, and worshipped with as great an ecstasy in his proportion,
as the prevailing spirit. Do thou so likewise: keep the station where God hath placed you,
and you shall never long for things without, but sit at home, feasting upon the Divine Providence
and thy own reason, by which we are taught that it is necessary and reasonable to submit to God.

For is not all the world God's family? Are not we his creatures? Are we not as clay in the
hand of the potter? Do we not live upon his meat, and move by his strength, and do our work
by his light? Are we any thing but what we are from him? And shall there be a mutiny among
the flocks and herds, because their lord or their shepherd chooses their pastures, and suffers
them not to wander into deserts and unknown ways? If we choose, we do it so foolishly that
we cannot like it long, and most commonly not at all: but God, who can do what he pleases,
is wise to choose safely for us, affectionate to comply with our needs, and powerful to execute
all his wise decrees. Here, therefore, is the wisdom of the contented man, to let God choose
for him; for when we have given up our wills to him, and stand in that station of the battle
where our great General hath placed us, our spirits must needs rest while our conditions have
for their security the power, the wisdom, and the charity of God.

Contentedness in all accidents brings great peace of spirit, and is the great and only instrument
of temporal felicity. It removes the sting from the accident, and makes a man not to depend
upon chance and the uncertain dispositions of men for his well-being, but only on God and his
own spirit. We ourselves make our fortunes good or bad; and when God lets loose a tyrant upon
us, or a sickness, or scorn, or a lessened fortune, if we fear to die, or know not to be patient,
or are proud or covetous, then the calamity sits heavy on us. But if we know how to manage
a noble principle, and fear not death so much as a dishonest action, and think impatience a
worse evil than a fever, and pride to be the biggest disgrace, and poverty to be infinitely
desirable before the torments of covetousness; then we who now think vice to be so easy, and
make it so familiar, and think the cure so impossible, shall quickly be of another mind, and
reckon these accidents amongst things eligible.

But no man can be happy that hath great hopes and great fears of things without, and events
depending upon other men, or upon the chances of fortune. The rewards of virtue are certain,
and our provisions for our natural support are certain; or if we want meat till we die, then
we die of that disease--and there are many worse than to die with an atrophy or consumption,
or unapt and coarser nourishment. But he that suffers a transporting passion concerning things
within the power of others, is free from sorrow and amazement no longer than his enemy shall
give him leave; and it is ten to one but he shall be smitten then and there where it shall
most trouble him; for so the adder teaches us where to strike, by her curious and fearful defending
of her head. The old Stoics, when you told them of a sad story, would still answer, "What is
that to me?" Yes, for the tyrant hath sentenced you also to prison. Well, what is that? He
will put a chain upon my leg; but he cannot bind my soul. No; but he will kill you. Then I
will die. If presently, let me go, that I may presently be freer than himself: but if not till
anon, or to-morrow, I will dine first, or sleep, or do what reason or nature calls for, as
at other times. This, in Gentile philosophy, is the same with the discourse of St. Paul, "I
have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased,
and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed, both to be full and
to be hungry; both to abound and suffer need."

We are in the world like men playing at tables; the chance is not in our power, but to play
it is; and when it is fallen we must manage it as we can: and let nothing trouble us, but when
we do a base action, or speak like a fool, or think wickedly,--these things God hath put into
our powers; but concerning those things which are wholly in the choice of another, they cannot
fall under our deliberation, and therefore neither are they fit for our passions. My fear may
make me miserable, but it cannot prevent what another hath in his power and purpose; and prosperities
can only be enjoyed by them who fear not at all to lose them; since the amazement and passion
concerning the future takes off all the pleasure of the present possession. Therefore, if thou
hast lost thy land, do not also lose thy constancy; and if thou must die a little sooner, yet
do not die impatiently. For no chance is evil to him that is content: and to a man nothing
is miserable unless it be unreasonable. No man can make another man to be his slave unless
he hath first enslaved himself to life and death, to pleasure or pain, to hope or fear: command
these passions, and you are freer than the Parthian kings.

VII. TO LUCASTA, ON GOING TO THE WARS.

RICHARD LOVELACE.--1618-1658.

VIII. ANGLING.

IZAAK WALTON.--1593-1683.

From THE COMPLETE ANGLER.

Venator.--O my good master, this morning walk has been spent to my great pleasure and wonder;
but I pray, when shall I have your direction how to make artificial flies, like to those that
the trout loves best, and also how to use them?

Piscator.--My honest scholar, it is now past five of the clock; we will fish till nine, and
then go to breakfast. Go you to yon sycamore-tree, and hide your bottle of drink under the
hollow root of it; for about that time, and in that place, we will make a brave breakfast with
a piece of powdered beef, and a radish or two, that I have in my fish-bag: we shall, I warrant
you, make a good, honest, wholesome, hungry breakfast, and I will then give you direction for
the making and using of your flies; and in the meantime, there is your rod and line, and my
advice is, that you fish as you see me do, and let's try which can catch the first fish.

Venator.--I thank you, master; I will observe and practise your direction as far as I am able.

Piscator.--Look you, scholar, you see I have hold of a good fish: I now see it is a trout.
I pray put that net under him, and touch not my line, for if you do, then we break all. Well
done, scholar! I thank you.

Now for another. Trust me, I have another bite: come, scholar, come, lay down your rod, and
help me to land this as you did the other. So now we shall be sure to have a good dish for supper.

Venator.--I am glad of that; but I have no fortune: sure, master, yours is a better rod and
better tackling.

Piscator.--Nay, then, take mine; and I will fish with yours. Look you, scholar, I have another.
Come, do as you did before. And now I have a bite at another. Oh me! he has broke all: there's
half a line and a good hook lost.

Venator.--Ay, and a good trout too.

Piscator.--Nay, the trout is not lost; for pray take notice, no man can lose what he never had.

Venator.--Master, I can neither catch with the first nor second angle: I have no fortune.

Piscator.--Look you, scholar, I have yet another. And now, having caught two brace of trouts,
I will tell you a short tale as we walk towards our breakfast. A scholar, a preacher I should
say, that was to preach to procure the approbation of a parish that he might be their lecturer,
had got from his fellow-pupil the copy of a sermon that was first preached with great commendation
by him that composed it; and though the borrower of it preached it, word for word, as it was
at first, yet it was utterly disliked as it was preached by the second to his congregation;
which the sermon borrower complained of to the lender of it; and thus was answered: "I lent
you, indeed, my fiddle, but not my fiddle-stick; for you are to know, that every one cannot
make music with my words, which are fitted to my own mouth." And so, my scholar, you are to
know, that as the ill pronunciation or ill accenting of words in a sermon spoils it, so the
ill carriage of your line, or not fishing even to a foot in a right place, makes you lose your
labor; and you are to know, that though you have my fiddle, that is, my very rod and tacklings
with which you see I catch fish, yet you have not my fiddle-stick, that is, you yet have not
skill to know how to carry your hand and line, nor how to guide it to a right place; and this
must be taught you; for you are to remember, I told you angling is an art, either by practice
or a long observation, or both. But take this for a rule: when you fish for a trout with a
worm, let your line have so much and not more lead than will fit the stream in which you fish;
that is to say, more in a great troublesome stream than in a smaller that is quieter; as near
as may be, so much as will sink the bait to the bottom, and keep it still in motion, and not more.

But now let's say grace and fall to breakfast. What say you, scholar, to the providence of
an old angler? does not this meat taste well? and was not this place well chosen to eat it?
for this sycamore-tree will shade us from the sun's heat.

Venator.--All excellent good, and my stomach excellent good too. And now I remember and find
that true which devout Lessius says: "That poor men, and those that fast often, have much more
pleasure in eating than rich men and gluttons, that always feed before their stomachs are empty
of their last meal, and call for more; for by that means they rob themselves of that pleasure
that hunger brings to poor men." And I do seriously approve of that saying of yours, "that
you would rather be a civil, well-governed, well-grounded, temperate, poor angler, than a drunken
lord." But I hope there is none such: however, I am certain of this, that I have been at many
very costly dinners that have not afforded me half the content that this has done, for which
I thank God and you.

And now, good master, proceed to your promised direction for making and ordering my artificial fly.

Piscator.--My honest scholar, I will do it; for it is a debt due unto you by my promise....

... Look how it begins to rain!--and by the clouds, if I mistake not, we shall presently have
a smoking shower, and therefore sit close: this sycamore-tree will shelter us; and I will tell
you, as they shall come into my mind, more observations of fly-fishing for a trout....

... And now, scholar, my direction for fly-fishing is ended with this shower, for it has done
raining: and now look about you, and see how pleasantly that meadow looks; nay, and the earth
smells as sweetly too. Come, let me tell you what holy Mr. Herbert says of such days and flowers
as these; and then we will thank God that we enjoy them, and walk to the river and sit down
quietly, and try to catch the other brace of trouts.

    Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
    The bridal of the earth and sky:
    The dew shall weep thy fall to-night;
                          For thou must die.

    Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,
    Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,
    Thy root is ever in its grave;
                          And thou must die.

    Sweet Spring, full of sweet days and roses,
    A box where sweets compacted lie;
    Thy music shows ye have your closes;
                          And all must die.

    Only a sweet and virtuous soul,
    Like season'd timber, never gives;
    But, though the whole world turn to coal,
                          Then chiefly lives.

Venator.--I thank you, good master, for your good direction for fly-fishing, and for the sweet
enjoyment of the pleasant day, which is so far spent without offence to God or man; and I thank
you for the sweet close of your discourse with Mr. Herbert's verses, who, I have heard, loved
angling; and I do the rather believe it, because he had a spirit suitable to anglers, and to
those primitive Christians that you love and have so much commended.

Piscator.--Well, my loving scholar, and I am pleased to know that you are so well pleased with
my direction and discourse.... And now, I think it will be time to repair to our angle-rods,
which we left in the water to fish for themselves: and you shall choose which shall be yours;
and it is an even lay, one of them catches.

And, let me tell you, this kind of fishing with a dead rod, and laying night-hooks, are like
putting money to use; for they both work for the owners, when they do nothing but sleep, or
eat, or rejoice; as you know we have done this last hour, and sat as quietly, and as free from
cares under this sycamore, as Virgil's Tityrus and his Meliboeus did, under their broad beech
tree. No life, my honest scholar, no life so happy and so pleasant, as the life of a well-governed
angler; for when the lawyer is swallowed up with business, and the statesman is preventing
or contriving plots, then we sit on cowslip banks, hear the birds sing, and possess ourselves
in as much quietness as these silent silver streams, which we now see glide so quietly by us.
Indeed, my good scholar, we may say of angling as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries, "Doubtless,
God could have made a better berry, but doubtless, God never did;" and so, if I might be judge,
"God never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent recreation than angling."

IX. ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY.

(1629).

JOHN MILTON.--1608-1674.

I.

    This is the month, and this the happy morn,
    Wherein the Son of Heaven's Eternal King,
    Of wedded maid and virgin mother born,
    Our great redemption from above did bring;
    For so the holy sages once did sing,
      That he our deadly forfeit should release,
    And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.

II.

    That glorious form, that light unsufferable,
    And that far-beaming blaze of majesty,
    Wherewith he wont at Heaven's high council-table
    To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,
    He laid aside; and, here with us to be,
      Forsook the courts of everlasting day,
    And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.

III.

    Say, Heavenly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein
    Afford a present to the Infant God?
    Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,
    To welcome him to this his new abode,
    Now while the heaven, by the Sun's team untrod,
      Hath took no print of the approaching light,
    And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?

IV.

    See how from far upon the eastern road
    The star-led wizards haste with odors sweet!
    O run, prevent them with thy humble ode,
    And lay it lowly at his blessèd feet;
    Have thou the honor first thy Lord to greet,
      And join thy voice unto the Angel Choir,
    From out his secret altar touch'd with hallow'd fire.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE HYMN.

1.

    It was the winter wild,
    While the Heaven-born child,
      All meanly wrapt, in the rude manger lies;
    Nature, in awe to him,
    Had doff'd her gaudy trim,
      With her great Master so to sympathize:
    It was no season then for her
    To wanton with the Sun, her lusty paramour.

2.

    Only, with speeches fair,
    She woos the gentle Air
      To hide her guilty front with innocent snow,
    And on her naked shame,
    Pollute with sinful blame,
      The saintly veil of maiden white to throw;
    Confounded, that her Maker's eyes
    Should look so near upon her foul deformities.

3.

    But he, her fears to cease,
    Sent down the meek-ey'd Peace:
      She, crown'd with olive green, came softly sliding
    Down through the turning sphere,
    His ready harbinger,
      With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;
    And, waving wide her myrtle wand,
    She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.

4.

    No war, or battle's sound,
    Was heard the world around:
      The idle spear and shield were high up hung;
    The hookèd chariot stood,
    Unstain'd with hostile blood;
      The trumpet spake not to the armèd throng;
    And kings sat still with awful eye,
    As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.

5.

    But peaceful was the night
    Wherein the Prince of Light
      His reign of peace upon the earth began:
    The winds, with wonder whist,
    Smoothly the waters kiss'd,
      Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean,
    Who now hath quite forgot to rave,
    While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmèd wave.

6.

    The stars, with deep amaze,
    Stand fix'd in steadfast gaze,
      Bending one way their precious influence;
    And will not take their flight,
    For all the morning light,
      Or Lucifer that often warn'd them thence;
    But in their glimmering orbs did glow,
    Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.

7.

    And, though the shady gloom
    Had given day her room,
    The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed;
      And hid his head for shame,
    As his inferior flame
      The new-enlighten'd world no more should need;
    He saw a greater Sun appear
    Than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear.

8.

    The shepherds on the lawn,
    Or ere the point of dawn,
      Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;
    Full little thought they then
    That the mighty Pan
      Was kindly come to live with them below:
    Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,
    Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.

9.

    When such music sweet
    Their hearts and ears did greet,
      As never was by mortal finger strook,
    Divinely-warbled voice
    Answering the stringèd noise,
      As all their souls in blissful rapture took:
    The Air, such pleasure loth to lose,
    With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.

10.

    Nature, that heard such sound
    Beneath the hollow round
      Of Cynthia's seat, the Airy region thrilling,
    Now was almost won
    To think her part was done,
      And that her reign had here its last fulfilling:
    She knew such harmony alone
    Could hold all Heaven and Earth in happier union.

11.

    At last surrounds their sight
    A globe of circular light,
      That with long beams the shame-faced Night array'd;
    The helmèd cherubim,
    And swordèd seraphim,
      Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd,
    Harping in loud and solemn choir,
    With unexpressive notes to Heaven's new-born Heir.

12.

    Such music (as 'tis said)
    Before was never made,
      But when of old the Sons of Morning sung,
    While the Creator great
    His constellations set,
      And the well-balanced world on hinges hung,
    And cast the dark foundations deep,
    And bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep.

13.

    Ring out, ye crystal spheres!
    Once bless our human ears,
      (If ye have power to touch our senses so,)
    And let your silver chime
    Move in melodious time;
      And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow;
    And with your ninefold harmony
    Make up full consort to the angelic symphony.

14.

    For, if such holy song
    Enwrap our fancy long,
      Time will run back, and fetch the Age of Gold;
    And speckled Vanity
    Will sicken soon and die;
      And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;
    And Hell itself will pass away,
    And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.

15.

    Yea, Truth and Justice then
    Will down return to men,
      Orb'd in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,
    Mercy will sit between,
    Thron'd in celestial sheen,
      With radiant feet the tissu'd clouds down steering;
    And Heaven, as at some festival,
    Will open wide the gates of her high palace-hall.

16.

    But wisest Fate says, No,
    This must not yet be so;
      The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy,
    That on the bitter cross
    Must redeem our loss;
      So both himself and us to glorify:
    Yet first, to those ychain'd in sleep,
    The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep.

17.

    With such a horrid clang
    As on Mount Sinai rang,
      While the red fire and smould'ring clouds out brake:
    The aged Earth, aghast,
    With terror of that blast,
      Shall from the surface to the centre shake;
    When, at the world's last session,
    The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.

18.

    And then at last our bliss
    Full and perfect is,
      But now begins; for from this happy day
    The Old Dragon under ground,
    In straiter limits bound,
      Not half so far casts his usurpèd sway;
    And, wroth to see his kingdom fail,
    Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.

19.

    The Oracles are dumb;
    No voice or hideous hum
      Runs through the archèd roof in words deceiving.
    Apollo from his shrine
    Can no more divine,
      With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
    No nightly trance, or breathèd spell,
    Inspires the pale-ey'd priest from the prophetic cell.

20.

    The lonely mountains o'er,
    And the resounding shore,
      A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;
    From haunted spring, and dale
    Edg'd with poplar pale,
      The parting Genius is with sighing sent;
    With flower-inwoven tresses torn
    The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.

21.

    In consecrated earth,
    And on the holy hearth,
      The Lars, and Lemures, moan with midnight plaint;
    In urns, and altars round,
    A drear and dying sound
      Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;
    And the chill marble seems to sweat,
    While each peculiar Power forgoes his wonted seat.

22.

    Peor, and Baälim,
    Forsake their temples dim,
      With that twice-batter'd God of Palestine;
    And moonèd Ashtaroth,
    Heaven's queen and mother both,
      Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine:
    The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn;
    In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.

23.

    And sullen Moloch, fled,
    Hath left in shadows dread,
      His burning idol all of blackest hue
    In vain with cymbals' ring
    They call the grisly king,
      In dismal dance about the furnace blue;
    The brutish gods of Nile as fast,
    Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.

24.

    Nor is Osiris seen
    In Memphian grove or green,
      Trampling the unshower'd grass with lowings loud;
    Nor can he be at rest
    Within his sacred chest;
      Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud;
    In vain, with timbrell'd anthems dark,
    The sable-stolèd sorcerers bear his worshipp'd ark.

25.

    He feels from Juda's land
    The dreaded Infant's hand;
      The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
    Nor all the gods beside
    Longer dare abide,
      Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
    Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,
    Can in his swaddling bands control the damnèd crew.

26.

    So, when the sun in bed,
    Curtain'd with cloudy red,
      Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,
    The flocking shadows pale
    Troop to the infernal jail,
      Each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave;
    And the yellow-skirted fays
    Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-lov'd maze.

27.

    But see! the Virgin blest
    Hath laid her Babe to rest.
      Time is our tedious song should here have ending:
    Heaven's youngest-teemèd star,
    Hath fix'd her polish'd car,
      Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;
    And all about the courtly stable
    Bright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.

X. CHARACTER OF LORD FALKLAND.

LORD CLARENDON.--1608-1674.

From HISTORY OF THE REBELLION.

In this unhappy battle [of Newbury] was slain the Lord Viscount Falkland; a person of such
prodigious parts of learning and knowledge, of that inimitable sweetness and delight in conversation,
of so flowing and obliging a humanity and goodness to mankind, and of that primitive simplicity
and integrity of life, that if there were no other brand upon this odious and accursed civil
war, than that single loss, it must be most infamous, and execrable to all posterity.

Before this parliament, his condition of life was so happy that it was hardly capable of improvement.
Before he came to be twenty years of age, he was master of a noble fortune, which descended
to him by the gift of a grandfather, without passing through his father or mother, who were
then both alive, and not well enough contented to find themselves passed by in the descent.
His education for some years had been in Ireland, where his father was lord-deputy; so that,
when he returned into England, to the possession of his fortune, he was unentangled with any
acquaintance or friends, which usually grow up by the custom of conversation; and therefore
was to make a pure election of his company; which he chose by other rules than were prescribed
to the young nobility of that time. And it cannot be denied, though he admitted some few to
his friendship for the agreeableness of their natures, and their undoubted affection to him,
that his familiarity and friendship, for the most part, was with men of the most eminent and
sublime parts, and of untouched reputation in point of integrity; and such men had a title
to his bosom.

He was a great cherisher of wit, and fancy, and good parts in any man; and, if he found them
clouded with poverty or want, a most liberal and bountiful patron towards them, even above
his fortune; of which, in those administrations, he was such a dispenser, as, if he had been
trusted with it to such uses, and if there had been the least of vice in his expense, he might
have been thought too prodigal. He was constant and pertinacious in whatsoever he resolved
to do, and not to be wearied by any pains that were necessary to that end. And, therefore,
having once resolved not to see London, which he loved above all places, till he had perfectly
learned the Greek tongue, he went to his own house in the country, and pursued it with that
indefatigable industry, that it will not be believed in how short a time he was master of it,
and accurately read all the Greek historians.

In this time, his house being within little more than ten miles of Oxford, he contracted familiarity
and friendship with the most polite and accurate men of that university; who found such an
immenseness of wit, and such a solidity of judgment in him, so infinite a fancy, bound in by
a most logical ratiocination, such a vast knowledge, that he was not ignorant in anything,
yet such an excessive humility, as if he had known nothing, that they frequently resorted and
dwelt with him, as in a college situated in a purer air; so that his house was a university
in a less volume; whither they came not so much for repose as study; and to examine and refine
those grosser propositions, which laziness and consent made current in vulgar conversation....

He was superior to all those passions and affections which attend vulgar minds, and was guilty
of no other ambition than of knowledge, and to be reputed a lover of all good men; and that
made him too much a contemner of those arts, which must be indulged in the transactions of
human affairs....

He had a courage of the most clear and keen temper, and so far from fear, that he seemed not
without some appetite of danger; and therefore, upon any occasion of action, he always engaged
his person in those troops which he thought, by the forwardness of the commanders, to be most
like to be farthest engaged; and in all such encounters, he had about him an extraordinary
cheerfulness, without at all affecting the execution that usually attended them; in which he
took no delight, but took pains to prevent it, where it was not by resistance made necessary:
insomuch that at Edge-hill, when the enemy was routed, he was like to have incurred great peril,
by interposing to save those who had thrown away their arms, and against whom, it may be, others
were more fierce for their having thrown them away: so that a man might think he came into
the field chiefly out of curiosity to see the face of danger, and charity to prevent the shedding
of blood. Yet, in his natural inclination, he acknowledged he was addicted to the profession
of a soldier; and shortly after he came to his fortune, before he was of age, he went into
the Low Countries, with a resolution of procuring command, and to give himself up to it; from
which he was diverted by the complete inactivity of that summer; so he returned into England,
and shortly after entered upon that vehement course of study we mentioned before, till the
first alarm from the north; then again he made ready for the field, and though he received
some repulse in the command of a troop of horse, of which he had a promise, he went a volunteer
with the earl of Essex.

From the entrance into this unnatural war, his natural cheerfulness and vivacity grew clouded,
and a kind of sadness and dejection of spirit stole upon him, which he had never been used
to; yet being one of those who believed that one battle would end all differences, and that
there would be so great a victory on one side, that the other would be compelled to submit
to any conditions from the victor--which supposition and conclusion generally sunk into the
minds of most men, and prevented the looking after many advantages that might then have been
laid hold of--he resisted those indispositions. But after the king's return from Brentford,
and the furious resolution of the two Houses not to admit any treaty for peace, those indispositions,
which had before touched him, grew into a perfect habit of uncheerfulness; and he, who had
been so exactly unreserved and affable to all men, that his face and countenance was always
present, and vacant, to his company, and held any cloudiness, and less pleasantness of the
visage, a kind of rudeness or incivility, became, on a sudden, less communicable; and thence,
very sad, pale, and exceedingly affected with the spleen. In his clothes and habit, which he
had minded before always with more neatness, and industry, and expense, than is usual to so
great a soul, he was not now only incurious, but too negligent; and in his reception of suitors,
and the necessary or casual addresses to his place, so quick, and sharp, and severe, that there
wanted not some men--strangers to his nature and disposition--who believed him proud and imperious;
from which no mortal man was ever more free....

When there was any overture or hope of peace, he would be more erect and vigorous, and exceedingly
solicitous to press anything which he thought might promote it; and sitting among his friends,
often, after a deep silence, and frequent sighs, would, with a shrill and sad accent, ingeminate
the word Peace, Peace; and would passionately profess, "that the very agony of the war, and
the view of the calamities and desolation the kingdom did and must endure, took his sleep from
him, and would shortly break his heart." This made some think, or pretend to think, "that he
was so much enamoured of peace, that he would have been glad the king should have bought it
at any price;" which was a most unreasonable calumny. As if a man, that was himself the most
punctual and precise in every circumstance that might reflect upon conscience or honor, could
have wished the king to have committed a trespass against either....

In the morning before the battle, as always upon action, he was very cheerful, and put himself
into the first rank of the Lord Byron's regiment, then advancing upon the enemy, who had lined
the hedges on both sides with musketeers; from whence he was shot with a musket in the lower
part of the belly, and in the instant falling from his horse, his body was not found till the
next morning; till when, there was some hope he might have been a prisoner; though his nearest
friends, who knew his temper, received small comfort from that imagination. Thus fell that
incomparable young man, in the four-and-thirtieth year of his age, having so much despatched
the true business of life, that the oldest rarely attain to that immense knowledge, and the
youngest enter not into the world with more innocency: whosoever leads such a life, needs be
the less anxious upon how short warning it is taken from him.

XI. VENI, CREATOR SPIRITUS.

JOHN DRYDEN.--1631-1700.

    Creator Spirit, by whose aid
    The world's foundations first were laid,
    Come, visit every pious mind;
    Come, pour thy joys on humankind;
    From sin and sorrow set us free,
    And make thy temples worthy thee.

      O source of uncreated light,
    The Father's promis'd Paraclete!
    Thrice holy fount, thrice holy fire,
    Our hearts with heavenly love inspire;
    Come, and thy sacred unction bring
    To sanctify us, while we sing.

      Plenteous of grace, descend from high,
    Rich in thy sevenfold energy!
    Thou strength of his Almighty hand,
    Whose power does heaven and earth command;
    Proceeding Spirit, our defence,
    Who dost the gift of tongues dispense,
    And crown'st thy gift with eloquence.

      Refine and purge our earthy parts;
    But, oh, inflame and fire our hearts!
    Our frailties help, our vice control,
    Submit the senses to the soul;
    And when rebellious they are grown,
    Then lay thy hand, and hold them down.

      Chase from our minds the infernal foe,
    And peace, the fruit of Love, bestow;
    And lest our feet should step astray,
    Protect and guide us in the way.

      Make us eternal truths receive,
    And practise all that we believe:
    Give us thy self, that we may see
    The Father and the Son by thee.

      Immortal honor, endless fame,
    Attend the Almighty Father's name:
    The Saviour Son be glorified,
    Who for lost man's redemption died:
    And equal adoration be,
    Eternal Paraclete, to thee!

XII. LINES PRINTED UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF MILTON.

DRYDEN.

    Three poets, in three distant ages born,
    Greece, Italy, and England did adorn.
    The first in loftiness of thought surpass'd,
    The next in majesty, in both the last.
    The force of Nature could no farther go;
    To make a third she join'd the former two.

XIII. REASON.

DRYDEN.

From RELIGIO LAICI.

    Dim as the borrowed beams of moon and stars
    To lonely, weary, wandering travellers,
    Is Reason to the soul; and as on high
    Those rolling fires discover but the sky,
    Not light us here; so Reason's glimmering ray
    Was lent, not to assure our doubtful way,
    But guide us upward to a better day
    And as those nightly tapers disappear,
    When day's bright lord ascends our hemisphere;
    So pale grows Reason at Religion's sight;
    So dies, and so dissolves, in supernatural light.

XIV. ON THE LOVE OF COUNTRY AS A PRINCIPLE OF ACTION.

RICHARD STEELE.--1672-1729.

From THE TATLER, June 10, 1710.

When men look into their own bosoms, and consider the generous seeds which are there planted,
that might, if rightly cultivated, ennoble their lives, and make their virtue venerable to
futurity; how can they, without tears, reflect on the universal degeneracy from that public
spirit, which ought to be the first and principal motive of all their actions? In the Grecian
and Roman nations, they were wise enough to keep up this great incentive, and it was impossible
to be in the fashion without being a patriot. All gallantry had its first source from hence;
and to want a warmth for the public welfare, was a defect so scandalous, that he who was guilty
of it had no pretence to honor or manhood. What makes the depravity among us, in this behalf,
the more vexatious and irksome to reflect upon, is, that the contempt of life is carried as
far amongst us, as it could be in those memorable people; and we want only a proper application
of the qualities which are frequent among us, to be as worthy as they. There is hardly a man
to be found who will not fight upon any occasion, which he thinks may taint his own honor.
Were this motive as strong in everything that regards the public, as it is in this our private
case, no man would pass his life away without having distinguished himself by some gallant
instance of his zeal towards it in the respective incidents of his life and profession. But
it is so far otherwise, that there cannot at present be a more ridiculous animal, than one
who seems to regard the good of others. He, in civil life, whose thoughts turn upon schemes
which may be of general benefit, without further reflection, is called a projector; and the
man whose mind seems intent upon glorious achievements, a knight-errant. The ridicule among
us runs strong against laudable actions; nay, in the ordinary course of things, and the common
regards of life, negligence of the public is an epidemic vice. The brewer in his excise, the
merchant in his customs, and, for aught we know, the soldier in his muster-rolls, think never
the worse of themselves for being guilty of their respective frauds towards the public. This
evil is come to such a fantastical height, that he is a man of a public spirit, and heroically
affected to his country, who can go so far as even to turn usurer with all he has in her funds.
There is not a citizen in whose imagination such a one does not appear in the same light of
glory, as Codrus, Scævola, or any other great name in old Rome. Were it not for the heroes
of so much per cent. as have regard enough for themselves and their nation to trade with her
with their wealth, the very notion of public love would long ere now have vanished from among
us. But however general custom may hurry us away in the stream of a common error, there is
no evil, no crime, so great as that of being cold in matters relating to the common good. This
is in nothing more conspicuous than in a certain willingness to receive anything that tends
to the diminution of such as have been conspicuous instruments in our service. Such inclinations
proceed from the most low and vile corruption, of which the soul of man is capable. This effaces
not only the practice, but the very approbation of honor and virtue; and has had such an effect,
that, to speak freely, the very sense of public good has no longer a part even in our conversations.
Can then the most generous motive of life, the good of others, be so easily banished the breast
of man? Is it possible to draw all our passions inward? Shall the boiling heat of youth be
sunk in pleasures, the ambition of manhood in selfish intrigues? Shall all that is glorious,
all that is worth the pursuit of great minds, be so easily rooted out? When the universal bent
of a people seems diverted from the sense of their common good, and common glory, it looks
like a fatality, and crisis of impending misfortune.

The generous nations we just now mentioned understood this so very well, that there was hardly
an oration ever made, which did not turn upon this general sense, "That the love of their country
was the first and most essential quality in an honest mind." Demosthenes, in a cause wherein
his fame, reputation, and fortune, were embarked, puts his all upon this issue; "Let the Athenians,"
says he, "be benevolent to me, as they think I have been zealous for them." This great and
discerning orator knew, there was nothing else in nature could bear him up against his adversaries,
but this one quality of having shown himself willing or able to serve his country. This certainly
is the test of merit; and the first foundation for deserving good-will is, having it yourself.
The adversary of this orator at that time was Æschines, a man of wily arts and skill in the
world, who could, as occasion served, fall in with a national start of passion, or sullenness
of humor, which a whole nation is sometimes taken with as well as a private man; and by that
means divert them from their common sense, into an aversion for receiving anything in its true
light. But when Demosthenes had awakened his audience with that one hint of judging by the
general tenor of his life towards them, his services bore down his opponent before him, who
fled to the covert of his mean arts, until some more favorable opportunity should offer against
the superior merit of Demosthenes.

It were to be wished, that love of their country were the first principle of action in men
of business, even for their own sakes; for when the world begins to examine into their conduct,
the generality, who have no share in, or hopes of any part in power or riches, but what is
the effect of their own labor or prosperity, will judge of them by no other method, than that
of how profitable their administration has been to the whole. They who are out of the influence
of men's fortune or favor, will let them stand or fall by this one only rule; and men who can
bear being tried by it, are always popular in their fall. Those, who cannot suffer such a scrutiny,
are contemptible in their advancement.

But I am here running into shreds of maxims from reading Tacitus this morning, which has driven
me from my recommendation of public spirit, which was the intended purpose of this lucubration.
There is not a more glorious instance of it, than in the character of Regulus. This same Regulus
was taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, and was sent by them to Rome, in order to demand some
Punic noblemen, who were prisoners, in exchange for himself; and was bound by an oath that
he would return to Carthage, if he failed in his commission. He proposes this to the senate,
who were in suspense upon it, which Regulus observing, without having the least notion of putting
the care of his own life in competition with the public good, desired them to consider that
he was old, and almost useless; that those demanded in exchange were men of daring tempers,
and great merit in military affairs; and wondered they would make any doubt of permitting him
to go back to the short tortures prepared for him at Carthage, where he should have the advantage
of ending a long life both gloriously and usefully. This generous advice was consented to;
and he took his leave of his country and his weeping friends, to go to certain death, with
that cheerful composure, as a man, after the fatigue of business in a court or a city, retires
to the next village for the air.

XV. THE GOLDEN SCALES.

JOSEPH ADDISON.--1672-1719.

From THE SPECTATOR, August 21, 1712.

I was lately entertaining myself with comparing Homer's balance, in which Jupiter is represented
as weighing the fates of Hector and Achilles, with a passage of Virgil, wherein that deity
is introduced as weighing the fates of Turnus and Æneas. I then considered how the same way
of thinking prevailed in the eastern parts of the world, as in those noble passages of Scripture,
where we are told, that the great king of Babylon, the day before his death, had been weighed
in the balance, and been found wanting. In other places of the holy writings the Almighty is
described as weighing the mountains in scales, making the weight for the winds, knowing the
balancings of the clouds; and, in others, as weighing the actions of men, and laying their
calamities together in a balance. Milton, as I have observed in a former paper, had an eye
to several of these foregoing instances, in that beautiful description wherein he represents
the archangel and the evil spirit as addressing themselves for the combat, but parted by the
balance which appeared in the heavens, and weighed the consequences of such a battle.

    The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,
    Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen
    Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,
    Wherein all things created first he weigh'd,
    The pendulous round earth with balanced air
    In counterpoise; now ponder; all events,
    Battles and realms: in these he puts two weights,
    The sequel each of parting and of fight:
    The latter quick up flew, and kick'd the beam;
    Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend.

    "Satan, I know thy strength, and thou know'st mine,
    Neither our own, but given; what folly then
    To boast what arms can do! since thine no more
    Than Heaven permits; nor mine, though doubled now
    To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,
    And read thy lot in yon celestial sign,
    Where thou art weigh'd, and shewn how light, how weak,
    If thou resist." The fiend look'd up and knew
    His mounted scale aloft; nor more: but fled
    Murm'ring, and with him fled the shades of night.

These several amusing thoughts having taken possession of my mind some time before I went to
sleep, and mingling themselves with my ordinary ideas, raised in my imagination a very odd
kind of vision. I was, methought, replaced in my study, and seated in my elbow-chair, where
I had indulged the foregoing speculations, with my lamp burning by me, as usual. Whilst I was
here meditating on several subjects of morality, and considering the nature of many virtues
and vices, as materials for those discourses with which I daily entertain the public; I saw,
methought, a pair of golden scales hanging by a chain in the same metal over the table that
stood before me; when, on a sudden, there were great heaps of weights thrown down on each side
of them. I found upon examining these weights, they showed the value of everything that is
in esteem among men. I made an essay of them, by putting the weight of wisdom in one scale,
and that of riches in another, upon which the latter, to show its comparative lightness, immediately
"flew up and kicked the beam."

But, before I proceed, I must inform my reader, that these weights did not exert their natural
gravity, till they were laid in the golden balance, insomuch that I could not guess which was
light or heavy, whilst I held them in my hand. This I found by several instances, for upon
my laying a weight in one of the scales, which was inscribed by the word Eternity; though I
threw in that of time, prosperity, affliction, wealth, poverty, interest, success, with many
other weights, which in my hand seemed very ponderous, they were not able to stir the opposite
balance, nor could they have prevailed, though assisted with the weight of the sun, the stars,
and the earth.

Upon emptying the scales, I laid several titles and honors, with pomps, triumphs, and many
weights of the like nature, in one of them, and seeing a little glittering weight lie by me,
I threw it accidentally into the other scale, when, to my great surprise, it proved so exact
a counterpoise, that it kept the balance in an equilibrium. This little glittering weight was
inscribed upon the edges of it with the word Vanity. I found there were several other weights
which were equally heavy, and exact counterpoises to one another; a few of them I tried, as
avarice and poverty, riches and content, with some others.

There were likewise several weights that were of the same figure, and seemed to correspond
with each other, but were entirely different when thrown into the scales, as religion and hypocrisy,
pedantry and learning, wit and vivacity, superstition and devotion, gravity and wisdom, with
many others.

I observed one particular weight lettered on both sides, and upon applying myself to the reading
of it, I found on one side written "In the dialect of men," and underneath it, "CALAMITIES;"
on the other side was written, "In the language of the gods," and underneath, "BLESSINGS."
I found the intrinsic value of this weight to be much greater than I imagined, for it overpowered
health, wealth, good-fortune, and many other weights, which were much more ponderous in my
hand than the other.

There is a saying among the Scotch, that "an ounce of mother is worth a pound of clergy;" I
was sensible of the truth of this saying, when I saw the difference between the weight of natural
parts and that of learning. The observation which I made upon these two weights opened to me
a new field of discoveries, for notwithstanding the weight of natural parts was much heavier
than that of learning, I observed that it weighed an hundred times heavier than it did before,
when I put learning into the same scale with it. I made the same observation upon faith and
morality; for notwithstanding the latter outweighed the former separately, it received a thousand
times more additional weight from its conjunction with the former, than what it had by itself.
This odd phenomenon showed itself in other particulars, as in wit and judgment, philosophy
and religion, justice and humanity, zeal and charity, depth of sense and perspicuity of style,
with innumerable other particulars, too long to be mentioned in this paper.

As a dream seldom fails of dashing seriousness with impertinence, mirth with gravity, methought
I made several other experiments of a more ludicrous nature, by one of which I found that an
English octavo was very often heavier than a French folio; and by another, that an old Greek
or Latin author weighed down a whole library of moderns. Seeing one of my Spectators lying
by me, I laid it into one of the scales, and flung a twopenny piece in the other. The reader
will not inquire into the event, if he remembers the first trial which I have recorded in this
paper. I afterwards threw both the sexes into the balance; but as it is not for my interest
to disoblige either of them, I shall desire to be excused from telling the result of this experiment.
Having an opportunity of this nature in my hands, I could not forbear throwing into one scale
the principles of a Tory, and in the other those of a Whig; but as I have all along declared
this to be a neutral paper, I shall likewise desire to be silent under this head also, though
upon examining one of the weights, I saw the word TEKEL engraven on it in capital letters.

I made many other experiments, and though I have not room for them all in this day's speculation,
I may perhaps reserve them for another. I shall only add, that upon my awaking I was sorry
to find my golden scales vanished, but resolved for the future to learn this lesson from them,
not to despise or value any things for their appearances, but to regulate my esteem and passions
towards them according to their real and intrinsic value.

       *       *       *       *       *

    It must be so--Plato, thou reasonest well!--
    Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
    This longing after immortality?
    Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,
    Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul
    Back on herself, and startles at destruction?
    'Tis the divinity that stirs within us;
    'Tis heaven itself that points out an hereafter,
    And intimates eternity to man.

        From Cato.--ADDISON.

XVI. MISJUDGED HOSPITALITY.

JONATHAN SWIFT.--1667-1745.

From THE TATLER, March 6, 1711.

Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes Emollit mores.

OVID.

Those inferior duties of life which the French call les petites morales, or the smaller morals,
are with us distinguished by the name of good manners or breeding. This I look upon, in the
general notion of it, to be a sort of artificial good sense, adapted to the meanest capacities,
and introduced to make mankind easy in their commerce with each other. Low and little understandings,
without some rules of this kind, would be perpetually wandering into a thousand indecencies
and irregularities in behavior; and in their ordinary conversation, fall into the same boisterous
familiarities that one observeth amongst them when a debauch hath quite taken away the use
of their reason. In other instances, it is odd to consider, that for want of common discretion,
the very end of good breeding is wholly perverted; and civility, intended to make us easy,
is employed in laying chains and fetters upon us, in debarring us of our wishes, and in crossing
our most reasonable desires and inclinations. This abuse reigneth chiefly in the country, as
I found to my vexation, when I was last there, in a visit I made to a neighbor about two miles
from my cousin. As soon as I entered the parlor, they put me into the great chair that stood
close by a huge fire, and kept me there by force, until I was almost stifled. Then a boy came
in great hurry to pull off my boots, which I in vain opposed, urging that I must return soon
after dinner. In the meantime, the good lady whispered her eldest daughter, and slipped a key
into her hand. The girl returned instantly with a beer-glass half full of aqua mirabilis and
syrup of gillyflowers. I took as much as I had a mind for; but madam avowed I should drink
it off--for she was sure it would do me good, after coming out of the cold air--and I was forced
to obey; which absolutely took away my stomach. When dinner came in, I had a mind to sit at
a distance from the fire; but they told me it was as much as my life was worth, and set me
with my back just against it. Although my appetite was quite gone, I resolved to force down
as much as I could; and desired the leg of a pullet. "Indeed, Mr. Bickerstaff," says the lady,
"you must eat a wing, to oblige me;" and so put a couple upon my plate. I was persecuted at
this rate during the whole meal. As often as I called for small-beer, the master tipped the
wink, and the servant brought me a brimmer of October. Some time after dinner, I ordered my
cousin's man, who came with me, to get ready the horses; but it was resolved I should not stir
that night; and when I seemed pretty much bent upon going, they ordered the stable door to
be locked; and the children hid my cloak and boots. The next question was, what I would have
for supper. I said I never ate anything at night; but was at last, in my own defence, obliged
to name the first thing that came into my head. After three hours spent chiefly in apologies
for my entertainment, insinuating to me, "that this was the worst time of the year for provisions;
that they were at a great distance from any market; that they were afraid I should be starved;
and that they knew they kept me to my loss," the lady went, and left me to her husband--for
they took special care I should never be alone. As soon as her back was turned, the little
misses ran backward and forward every moment; and constantly as they came in, or went out,
made a courtesy directly at me, which, in good manners, I was forced to return with a bow,
and, "Your humble servant, pretty miss." Exactly at eight the mother came up, and discovered
by the redness of her face that supper was not far off. It was twice as large as the dinner,
and my persecution doubled in proportion. I desired, at my usual hour, to go to my repose,
and was conducted to my chamber by the gentleman, his lady, and the whole train of children.
They importuned me to drink something before I went to bed; and upon my refusing, at last left
a bottle of stingo, as they called it, for fear I should wake and be thirsty in the night.
I was forced in the morning to rise and dress myself in the dark, because they would not suffer
my kinsman's servant to disturb me at the hour I desired to be called. I was now resolved to
break through all measures to get away; and after sitting down to a monstrous breakfast of
cold beef, mutton, neats' tongues, venison-pasty, and stale-beer, took leave of the family.
But the gentleman would needs see me part of my way, and carry me a short-cut through his own
grounds, which he told me would save half a mile's riding. This last piece of civility had
like to have cost me dear, being once or twice in danger of my neck, by leaping over his ditches,
and at last forced to alight in the dirt; when my horse, having slipped his bridle, ran away,
and took us up more than an hour to recover him again. It is evident that none of the absurdities
I met with in this visit proceeded from an ill intention, but from a wrong judgment of complaisance,
and a misapplication in the rules of it.

XVII. FROM THE "ESSAY ON MAN."[B]

ALEXANDER POPE.--1688-1744.

    Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate,
    All but the page prescrib'd, their present state;
    From brutes what men, from men what spirits know;
    Or who could suffer being here below?
    The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,
    Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?
    Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flowery food,
    And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.
    O blindness to the future! kindly given,
    That each may fill the circle mark'd by heaven;
    Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,
    A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,
    Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,
    And now a bubble burst, and now a world.
      Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;
    Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.
    What future bliss he gives not thee to know,
    But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.
    Hope springs eternal in the human breast:
    Man never is, but always to be, blest.
    The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home,
    Rests and expatiates in a life to come.
      Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind
    Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
    His soul proud science never taught to stray
    Far as the solar walk, or milky way;
    Yet simple nature to his hope has given,
    Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heaven;
    Some safer world in depth of woods embraced,
    Some happier island in the watery waste,
    Where slaves once more their native land behold,
    No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.
    To be, contents his natural desire;
    He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;
    But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
    His faithful dog shall bear him company.

      What if the foot, ordain'd the dust to tread,
    Or hand, to toil, aspir'd to be the head?
    What if the head, the eye, or ear repin'd
    To serve mere engines to the ruling mind?
    Just as absurd for any part to claim
    To be another, in this general frame;
    Just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains
    The great directing Mind of All ordains.
      All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
    Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;
    That changed through all, and yet in all the same,
    Great in the earth, as in the ethereal frame,
    Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,
    Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees;
    Lives through all life, extends through all extent,
    Spreads undivided, operates unspent;
    Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,
    As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;
    As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,
    As the rapt seraph that adores and burns:
    To him no high, no low, no great, no small;
    He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.

      All nature is but art unknown to thee;
    All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;
    All discord, harmony not understood;
    All partial evil, universal good:
    And spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,
    One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right.

      Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
    As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;
    Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
    We first endure, then pity, then embrace.

      Virtuous and vicious every man must be,
    Few in the extreme, but all in the degree:
    The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise;
    And even the best by fits what they despise.

      Behold the child, by Nature's kindly law,
    Pleas'd with a rattle, tickled with a straw:
    Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight,
    A little louder, but as empty quite:
    Scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage,
    And beads and prayer-books are the toys of age:
    Pleas'd with this bauble still, as that before,
    Till tired he sleeps, and life's poor play is o'er.

      Has God, thou fool! work'd solely for thy good
    Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food?
    Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn,
    For him as kindly spreads the flowery lawn.
    Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings?
    Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings.
    Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat?
    Loves of his own and raptures swell the note.
    The bounding steed you pompously bestride
    Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride.
    Is thine alone the seed that strews the plain?
    The birds of heaven shall vindicate their grain.
    Thine the full harvest of the golden year?
    Part pays, and justly, the deserving steer.
    The hog, that ploughs not, nor obeys thy call,
    Lives on the labors of this lord of all.
      Know, Nature's children all divide her care;
    The fur that warms a monarch warm'd a bear.
    While man exclaims, "See all things for my use!"
    "See man for mine!" replies a pamper'd goose:
    And just as short of reason he must fall,
    Who thinks all made for one, not one for all.

      For forms of government let fools contest;
    Whate'er is best administer'd is best:
    For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight;
    His can't be wrong whose life is in the right.
    In faith and hope the world will disagree,
    But all mankind's concern is charity:
    All must be false that thwart this one great end,
    And all of God that bless mankind or mend.

      Honor and shame from no condition rise;
    Act well your part, there all the honor lies.
    Fortune in men has some small difference made,
    One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade;
    The cobbler apron'd, and the parson gown'd,
    The friar hooded, and the monarch crown'd.
    "What differ more (you cry) than crown and cowl?"
    I'll tell you, friend, a wise man and a fool.
    You'll find, if once the monarch acts the monk,
    Or, cobbler-like, the parson will be drunk,
    Worth makes the man, and want of it, the fellow;
    The rest is all but leather or prunello.

      Go! if your ancient but ignoble blood
    Has crept through scoundrels ever since the flood,
    Go! and pretend your family is young,
    Nor own your fathers have been fools so long.
    What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards?
    Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards.

      Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave,
    Is but the more a fool, the more a knave.
    Who noble ends by noble means obtains,
    Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,
    Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed
    Like Socrates,--that man is great indeed.

    An honest man's the noblest work of God.

    Know then this truth (enough for man to know),
    "Virtue alone is happiness below."

    ... Never elated while one man's oppress'd;
    Never dejected while another's bless'd....[C]

    See the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow!
    Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know:
    Yet poor with fortune, and with learning blind,
    The bad must miss, the good untaught will find:
    Slave to no sect, who takes no private road,
    But looks through nature up to nature's God;
    Pursues that chain which links the immense design,
    Joins heaven and earth, and mortal and divine:
    Sees that no being any bliss can know,
    But touches some above and some below;
    Learns from this union of the rising whole,
    The first, last purpose of the human soul;
    And knows where faith, law, morals, all began,
    All end, in love of God and love of man.

XVIII. RULE, BRITANNIA.

JAMES THOMSON.--1700-1748.

    When Britain first, at Heaven's command,
      Arose from out the azure main,
    This was the charter of the land,
      And guardian angels sang this strain:
          Rule, Britannia, rule the waves!
          Britons never will be slaves!

    The nations not so blest as thee,
      Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall,
    Whilst thou shalt flourish, great and free,
      The dread and envy of them all.
          Rule, Britannia, rule the waves!
          Britons never will be slaves!

    Still more majestic shalt thou rise,
      More dreadful from each foreign stroke;
    As the loud blast that tears the skies,
      Serves but to root thy native oak.
          Rule, Britannia, rule the waves!
          Britons never will be slaves!

    Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame;
      All their attempts to bend thee down
    Will but arouse thy generous flame,
      But work their woe and thy renown.
          Rule, Britannia, rule the waves!
          Britons never will be slaves!

    To thee belongs the rural reign;
      Thy cities shall with commerce shine;
    All thine shall be the subject main,
      And every shore it circles thine.
          Rule, Britannia, rule the waves!
          Britons never will be slaves!

    The Muses, still with freedom found,
      Shall to thy happy coast repair;
    Blest isle! with matchless beauty crown'd,
      And manly hearts to guard the fair.
          Rule, Britannia, rule the waves!
          Britons never will be slaves!

XIX. THE FIRST CRUSADE.

DAVID HUME.--1711-1776.

From HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

After Mahomet had, by means of his pretended revelations, united the dispersed Arabians under
one head, they issued forth from their deserts in great multitudes; and being animated with
zeal for their new religion, and supported by the vigor of their new government, they made
deep impression on the eastern empire, which was far in the decline, with regard both to military
discipline and to civil policy. Jerusalem, by its situation, became one of their most early
conquests; and the Christians had the mortification to see the holy sepulchre, and the other
places, consecrated by the presence of their religious founder, fallen into the possession
of infidels. But the Arabians or Saracens were so employed in military enterprises, by which
they spread their empire in a few years from the banks of the Ganges to the Straits of Gibraltar,
that they had no leisure for theological controversy: and though the Alcoran, the original
monument of their faith, seems to contain some violent precepts, they were much less infected
with the spirit of bigotry and persecution than the indolent and speculative Greeks, who were
continually refining on the several articles of their religious system. They gave little disturbance
to those zealous pilgrims, who daily flocked to Jerusalem; and they allowed every man, after
paying a moderate tribute, to visit the holy sepulchre, to perform his religious duties, and
to return in peace. But the Turcomans or Turks, a tribe of Tartars, who had embraced Mahometanism,
having wrested Syria from the Saracens, and having, in the year 1065, made themselves masters
of Jerusalem, rendered the pilgrimage much more difficult and dangerous to the Christians.
The barbarity of their manners, and the confusions attending their unsettled government, exposed
the pilgrims to many insults, robberies, and extortions: and these zealots, returning from
their meritorious fatigues and sufferings, filled all Christendom with indignation against
the infidels, who profaned the holy city by their presence, and derided the sacred mysteries
in the very place of their completion. Gregory VII., among the other vast ideas which he entertained,
had formed the design of uniting all the Western Christians against the Mahometans; but the
egregious and violent invasions of that pontiff on the civil power of princes, had created
him so many enemies, and had rendered his schemes so suspicious, that he was not able to make
great progress in this undertaking. The work was reserved for a meaner instrument, whose low
condition in life exposed him to no jealousy, and whose folly was well calculated to coincide
with the prevailing principles of the times.

Peter, commonly called the Hermit, a native of Amiens in Picardy, had made the pilgrimage to
Jerusalem. Being deeply affected with the dangers to which that act of piety now exposed the
pilgrims, as well as with the instances of oppression under which the Eastern Christians labored,
he entertained the bold, and, in all appearance, impracticable project of leading into Asia,
from the farthest extremities of the West, armies sufficient to subdue those potent and warlike
nations which now held the holy city in subjection. He proposed his views to Martin II., who
filled the papal chair, and who, though sensible of the advantages which the head of the Christian
religion must reap from a religious war, and though he esteemed the blind zeal of Peter a proper
means for effecting the purpose, resolved not to interpose his authority, till he saw a greater
probability of success. He summoned a council at Placentia, which consisted of four thousand
ecclesiastics, and thirty thousand seculars; and which was so numerous that no hall could contain
the multitude, and it was necessary to hold the assembly in a plain. The harangues of the Pope,
and of Peter himself, representing the dismal situation of their brethren in the East, and
the indignity suffered by the Christian name, in allowing the holy city to remain in the hands
of infidels, here found the minds of men so well prepared, that the whole multitude suddenly
and violently declared for the war, and solemnly devoted themselves to perform this service,
so meritorious, as they believed it, to God and religion.

But though Italy seemed thus to have zealously embraced the enterprise, Martin knew, that,
in order to insure success, it was necessary to enlist the greater and more warlike nations
in the same engagement; and having previously exhorted Peter to visit the chief cities and
sovereigns of Christendom, he summoned another council at Clermont in Auvergne. The fame of
this great and pious design being now universally diffused, procured the attendance of the
greatest prelates, nobles, and princes; and when the Pope and the Hermit renewed their pathetic
exhortations, the whole assembly, as if impelled by an immediate inspiration, not moved by
their preceding impressions, exclaimed with one voice, It is the will of God, It is the will
of God!--words deemed so memorable, and so much the result of a divine influence, that they
were employed as the signal of rendezvous and battle in all the future exploits of those adventurers.
Men of all ranks flew to arms with the utmost ardor; and an exterior symbol, too, a circumstance
of chief moment, was here chosen by the devoted combatants. The sign of the cross, which had
been hitherto so much revered among Christians, and which, the more it was an object of reproach
among the Pagan world, was the more passionately cherished by them, became the badge of union,
and was affixed to their right shoulder, by all who enlisted themselves in this sacred warfare.

Europe was at this time sunk into profound ignorance and superstition. The ecclesiastics had
acquired the greatest ascendant over the human mind: the people, who, being little restrained
by honor, and less by law, abandoned themselves to the worst crimes and disorders, knew of
no other expiation than the observances imposed on them by their spiritual pastors: and it
was easy to represent the holy war as an equivalent for all penances, and an atonement for
every violation of justice and humanity. But amidst the abject superstition which now prevailed,
the military spirit also had universally diffused itself; and though not supported by art or
discipline, was become the general passion of the nations governed by the feudal law. All the
great lords possessed the right of peace and war: they were engaged in perpetual hostilities
with each other: the open country was become a scene of outrage and disorder: the cities, still
mean and poor, were neither guarded by walls nor protected by privileges, and were exposed
to every insult: individuals were obliged to depend for safety on their own force, or their
private alliances: and valor was the only excellence which was held in esteem, or gave one
man the pre-eminence above another. When all the particular superstitions, therefore, were
here united in one great object, the ardor for military enterprises took the same direction;
and Europe, impelled by its two ruling passions, was loosened, as it were, from its foundations,
and seemed to precipitate itself in one united body upon the East.

All orders of men, deeming the Crusades the only road to heaven, enlisted themselves under
these sacred banners, and were impatient to open the way with their sword to the holy city.
Nobles, artisans, peasants, even priests, enrolled their names; and to decline this meritorious
service was branded with the reproach of impiety, or, what perhaps was esteemed still more
disgraceful, of cowardice and pusillanimity. The infirm and aged contributed to the expedition
by presents and money; and many of them, not satisfied with the merit of this atonement, attended
it in person, and were determined, if possible, to breathe their last in sight of that city
where their Saviour had died for them. Women themselves, concealing their sex under the disguise
of armor, attended the camp. The greatest criminals were forward in a service, which they regarded
as a propitiation for all crimes; and the most enormous disorders were, during the course of
those expeditions, committed by men enured to wickedness, encouraged by example, and impelled
by necessity. The multitude of the adventurers soon became so great, that their more sagacious
leaders, Hugh count of Vermandois, brother to the French king, Raymond count of Toulouse, Godfrey
of Bouillon, prince of Brabant, and Stephen count of Blois, became apprehensive lest the greatness
itself of the armament should disappoint its purpose; and they permitted an undisciplined multitude,
computed at 300,000 men, to go before them, under the command of Peter the Hermit and Walter
the Moneyless. These men took the road towards Constantinople through Hungary and Bulgaria;
and trusting that Heaven, by supernatural assistance, would supply all their necessities, they
made no provision for subsistance on their march. They soon found themselves obliged to obtain
by plunder, what they had vainly expected from miracles; and the enraged inhabitants of the
countries through which they passed, gathering together in arms, attacked the disorderly multitude
and put them to slaughter without resistance. The more disciplined armies followed after; and
passing the straights at Constantinople, they were mustered in the plains of Asia, and amounted
in the whole to the number of 700,000 combatants....

After the adventurers in the holy war were assembled on the banks of the Bosphorus, opposite
to Constantinople, they proceeded on their enterprise; but immediately experienced those difficulties
which their zeal had hitherto concealed from them, and for which, even if they had foreseen
them, it would have been almost impossible to provide a remedy. The Greek emperor, Alexis Comnenus,
who had applied to the Western Christians for succor against the Turks, entertained hopes,
and those but feeble ones, of obtaining such a moderate supply, as, acting under his command,
might enable him to repulse the enemy: but he was extremely astonished to see his dominions
overwhelmed, on a sudden, by such an inundation of licentious barbarians, who, though they
pretended friendship, despised his subjects as unwarlike, and detested them as heretical. By
all the arts of policy, in which he excelled, he endeavored to divert the torrent; but while
he employed professions, caresses, civilities, and seeming services towards the leaders of
the crusade, he secretly regarded those imperious allies as more dangerous than the open enemies
by whom his empire had been formerly invaded. Having effected that difficult point of disembarking
them safely in Asia, he entered into a private correspondence with Soliman, emperor of the
Turks; and practised every insidious art, which his genius, his power, or his situation, enabled
him to employ, for disappointing the enterprise, and discouraging the Latins from making thenceforward
any such prodigious migrations. His dangerous policy was seconded by the disorders inseparable
from so vast a multitude, who were not united under one head, and were conducted by leaders
of the most independent intractable spirit, unacquainted with military discipline, and determined
enemies to civil authority and submission. The scarcity of provisions, the excesses of fatigue,
the influence of unknown climates, joined to the want of concert in their operations, and to
the sword of a warlike enemy, destroyed the adventurers by thousands, and would have abated
the ardor of men impelled to war by less powerful motives. Their zeal, however, their bravery,
and their irresistible force, still carried them forward, and continually advanced them to
the great end of their enterprise. After an obstinate siege they took Nice, the seat of the
Turkish empire; they defeated Soliman in two great battles; they made themselves masters of
Antioch; and entirely broke the force of the Turks, who had so long retained those countries
in subjection. The soldan of Egypt, whose alliance they had hitherto courted, recovered, on
the fall of the Turkish power, his former authority in Jerusalem; and he informed them by his
ambassadors, that if they came disarmed to that city, they might now perform their religious
vows, and that all Christian pilgrims, who should thenceforth visit the holy sepulchre, might
expect the same good treatment which they had ever received from his predecessors. The offer
was rejected; the soldan was required to yield up the city to the Christians; and on his refusal,
the champions of the cross advanced to the siege of Jerusalem, which they regarded as the consummation
of their labors. By the detachments which they had made, and the disasters which they had undergone,
they were diminished to the number of twenty thousand foot, and fifteen hundred horse; but
these were still formidable, from their valor, their experience, and the obedience which, from
past calamities, they had learned to pay to their leaders. After a siege of five weeks, they
took Jerusalem by assault; and, impelled by a mixture of military and religious rage, they
put the numerous garrison and inhabitants to the sword without distinction.

Neither arms defended the valiant, nor submission the timorous: no age or sex was spared: infants
on the breast were pierced by the same blow with their mothers, who implored for mercy: even
a multitude to the number of ten thousand persons, who had surrendered themselves prisoners,
and were promised quarter, were butchered in cold blood by those ferocious conquerors. The
streets of Jerusalem were covered with dead bodies; and the triumphant warriors, after every
enemy was subdued and slaughtered, immediately turned themselves, with the sentiments of humiliation
and contrition, towards the holy sepulchre. They threw aside their arms, still streaming with
blood: they advanced with reclined bodies, and naked feet and heads, to that sacred monument:
they sang anthems to their Saviour, who had there purchased their salvation by his death and
agony: and their devotion, enlivened by the presence of the place where he had suffered, so
overcame their fury, that they dissolved in tears, and bore the appearance of every soft and
tender sentiment. So inconsistent is human nature with itself! and so easily does the most
effeminate superstition ally, both with the most heroic courage and with the fiercest barbarity!

This great event happened on the fifth of July in the last year of the eleventh century. The
Christian princes and nobles, after choosing Godfrey of Bouillon king of Jerusalem, began to
settle themselves in their new conquests; while some of them returned to Europe, in order to
enjoy at home that glory, which their valor had acquired them in this popular and meritorious
enterprise.

XX. THE BARD.

A Pindaric Ode.[D]

THOMAS GRAY.--1716-1771.

I. 1.
    Helm, nor hauberk's twisted mail,
    Nor e'en thy virtues, Tyrant, shall avail
      To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,
      From Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears!"
    Such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride
      Of the first Edward scatter'd wild dismay,
    As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side
      He wound with toilsome march his long array.
    Stout Glo'ster stood aghast in speechless trance:
    "To arms!" cried Mortimer, and couch'd his quivering lance.

I. 2.

      On a rock, whose haughty brow
    Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood,
      Rob'd in the sable garb of woe,
    With haggard eyes the Poet stood;
    (Loose his beard, and hoary hair
    Stream'd, like a meteor, to the troubled air),
    And with a master's hand, and prophet's fire,
    Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre.
      "Hark, how each giant-oak, and desert cave,
    Sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath!
    O'er thee, O King! their hundred arms they wave,
      Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe;
    Vocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day,
    To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay.

I. 3.

      "Cold is Cadwallo's tongue,
      That hush'd the stormy main:
    Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed:
      Mountains, ye mourn in vain
      Modred, whose magic song
    Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head.
      On dreary Arvon's shore they lie,
    Smear'd with gore, and ghastly pale:
    Far, far aloof the affrighted ravens sail;
      The famish'd eagle screams, and passes by. They do not sleep.
      On yonder cliffs, a grisly band,
    I see them sit; they linger yet,
      Avengers of their native land:
    With me in dreadful harmony they join,
    And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line.

II. 1.

      "Weave the warp, and weave the woof,
    The winding-sheet of Edward's race.
      Give ample room, and verge enough
    The characters of hell to trace.
    Mark the year, and mark the night,
    When Severn shall re-echo with affright
    The shrieks of death, through Berkley's roof that ring,
    Shrieks of an agonizing king!
      She-wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs,
    That tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate,
      From thee be born, who o'er thy country hangs
    The scourge of heaven. What terrors round him wait!
    Amazement in his van, with flight combin'd,
    And Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind.

II. 2.

      "Mighty victor, mighty lord!
    Low on his funeral couch he lies!
      No pitying heart, no eye, afford
    A tear to grace his obsequies.
      Is the sable warrior fled?
    Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead.
    The swarm, that in thy noontide beam were born?
    Gone to salute the rising morn.
    Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the Zephyr blows,
      While proudly riding o'er the azure realm
    In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes;
      Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;
    Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway,
    That, hush'd in grim repose, expects his evening prey.

II. 3.

      "Fill high the sparkling bowl,
    The rich repast prepare;
      Reft of a crown, he yet may share the feast:
    Close by the regal chair
      Fell Thirst and Famine scowl
      A baleful smile upon their baffled guest.
    Heard ye the din of battle bray,
      Lance to lance, and horse to horse?
      Long years of havoc urge their destin'd course,
    And through the kindred squadrons mow their way.
      Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,
    With many a foul and midnight murder fed,
      Revere his consort's faith, his father's fame,
    And spare the meek usurper's holy head.
    Above, below, the rose of snow,
      Twin'd with her blushing foe, we spread:
    The bristled boar in infant-gore
      Wallows beneath the thorny shade.
    Now, brothers, bending o'er the accursèd loom,
    Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.

III. 1.

      "Edward, lo! to sudden fate
    (Weave we the woof. The thread is spun.)
      Half of thy heart we consecrate.
    (The web is wove. The work is done.)
    Stay, O stay! nor thus forlorn
    Leave me unbless'd, unpitied, here to mourn:
    In yon bright track, that fires the western skies,
    They melt, they vanish from my eyes.
    But oh! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height
      Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll?
    Visions of glory, spare my aching sight!
      Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul!
    No more our long-lost Arthur we bewail.
    All hail, ye genuine kings, Britannia's issue, hail!

III. 2.

      "Girt with many a baron bold
    Sublime their starry fronts they rear;
      And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old
    In bearded majesty, appear.
    In the midst a form divine!
    Her eye proclaims her of the Briton-line;
    Her lion-port, her awe-commanding face,
    Attemper'd sweet to virgin-grace.
    What strings symphonious tremble in the air,
      What strains of vocal transport round her play.
    Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear
      They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.
    Bright Rapture calls, and soaring, as she sings,
    Waves in the eye of heaven her many-color'd wings.

III. 3.

    "The verse adorn again
      Fierce War, and faithful Love,
    And Truth severe, by fairy Fiction drest.
      In buskin'd measures move
    Pale Grief, and pleasing Pain,
    With Horror, tyrant of the throbbing breast.
      A voice, as of the cherub-choir,
    Gales from blooming Eden bear;
    And distant warblings lessen on my ear,
      That lost in long futurity expire.
    Fond impious man, thinks thou yon sanguine cloud,
      Rais'd by thy breath, has quench'd the orb of day?
    To-morrow he repairs the golden flood,
      And warms the nations with redoubled ray.
    Enough for me: with joy I see
      The different doom our fates assign.
    Be thine despair, and sceptred care;
      To triumph, and to die, are mine."
    He spoke, and headlong from the mountain's height
    Deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night.

the conquest of that country, ordered all the Bards that fell into his hands to be put to death.--GRAY.

XXI. ON AN ADDRESS TO THE THRONE CONCERNING AFFAIRS IN AMERICA.

HOUSE OF LORDS--November 18th, 1777.

LORD CHATHAM.--1708-1778.

I rise, my Lords, to declare my sentiments on this most solemn and serious subject. It has
imposed a load upon my mind, which, I fear, nothing can remove, but which impels me to endeavor
its alleviation, by a free and unreserved communication of my sentiments.

In the first part of the address, I have the honor of heartily concurring with the noble Earl
who moved it. No man feels sincerer joy than I do; none can offer more genuine congratulations
on every accession of strength to the Protestant succession. I therefore join in every congratulation
on the birth of another princess, and the happy recovery of her Majesty.

But I must stop here. My courtly complaisance will carry me no farther. I will not join in
congratulation on misfortune and disgrace. I cannot concur in a blind and servile address,
which approves and endeavors to sanctify the monstrous measures which have heaped disgrace
and misfortune upon us. This, my Lords, is a perilous and tremendous moment! It is not a time
for adulation. The smoothness of flattery cannot now avail--cannot save us in this rugged and
awful crisis. It is now necessary to instruct the Throne in the language of truth. We must
dispel the illusion and the darkness which envelop it, and display, in its full danger and
true colors, the ruin that is brought to our doors.

This, my Lords, is our duty. It is the proper function of this noble assembly, sitting, as
we do, upon our honors in this House, the hereditary council of the Crown. Who is the minister--where
is the minister, that has dared to suggest to the Throne the contrary, unconstitutional language
this day delivered from it? The accustomed language from the Throne has been application to
Parliament for advice, and a reliance on its constitutional advice and assistance. As it is
the right of Parliament to give, so it is the duty of the Crown to ask it. But on this day,
and in this extreme momentous exigency, no reliance is reposed on our constitutional counsels!
no advice is asked from the sober and enlightened care of Parliament! but the Crown, from itself
and by itself, declares an unalterable determination to pursue measures--and what measures,
my Lords? The measures that have produced the imminent perils that threaten us; the measures
that have brought ruin to our doors.

Can the minister of the day now presume to expect a continuance of support in this ruinous
infatuation? Can Parliament be so dead to its dignity and its duty as to be thus deluded into
the loss of the one and the violation of the other? To give an unlimited credit and support
for the steady perseverance in measures not proposed for our parliamentary advice, but dictated
and forced upon us--in measures, I say, my Lords, which have reduced this late flourishing
empire to ruin and contempt! "But yesterday, and England might have stood against the world:
now none so poor to do her reverence." I use the words of a poet; but, though it be poetry,
it is no fiction. It is a shameful truth, that not only the power and strength of this country
are wasting away and expiring, but her well-earned glories, her true honor, and substantial
dignity are sacrificed.

France, my Lords, has insulted you; she has encouraged and sustained America; and, whether
America be wrong or right, the dignity of this country ought to spurn at the officious insult
of French interference. The ministers and ambassadors of those who are called rebels and enemies
are in Paris; in Paris they transact the reciprocal interests of America and France. Can there
be a more mortifying insult? Can even our ministers sustain a more humiliating disgrace? Do
they dare to resent it? Do they presume even to hint a vindication of their honor, and the
dignity of the State, by requiring the dismission of the plenipotentiaries of America? Such
is the degradation to which they have reduced the glories of England! The people whom they
affect to call contemptible rebels, but whose growing power has at last obtained the name of
enemies; the people with whom they have engaged this country in war, and against whom they
now command our implicit support in every measure of desperate hostility--this people, despised
as rebels, or acknowledged as enemies, are abetted against you, supplied with every military
store, their interests consulted, and their ambassadors entertained, by your inveterate enemy!
and our ministers dare not interpose with dignity or effect. Is this the honor of a great kingdom?
Is this the indignant spirit of England, who "but yesterday" gave law to the house of Bourbon?
My Lords, the dignity of nations demands a decisive conduct in a situation like this....

My Lords, this ruinous and ignominious situation, where we can not act with success, nor suffer
with honor, calls upon us to remonstrate in the strongest and loudest language of truth, to
rescue the ear of majesty from the delusions which surround it. The desperate state of our
arms abroad is in part known. No man thinks more highly of them than I do. I love and honor
the English troops. I know their virtues and their valor. I know they can achieve anything
except impossibilities; and I know that the conquest of English America is an impossibility.
You cannot, I venture to say it, you cannot conquer America. Your armies in the last war effected
everything that could be effected; and what was it? It cost a numerous army, under the command
of a most able general [Lord Amherst], now a noble Lord in this House, a long and laborious
campaign, to expel five thousand Frenchmen from French America. My Lords, you cannot conquer
America. What is your present situation there? We do not know the worst; but we know that in
three campaigns we have done nothing and suffered much. Besides the sufferings, perhaps total
loss of the Northern force, the best appointed army that ever took the field, commanded by
Sir William Howe, has retired from the American lines. He was obliged to relinquish his attempt,
and with great delay and danger to adopt a new and distant plan of operations. We shall soon
know, and in any event have reason to lament, what may have happened since. As to conquest,
therefore, my Lords, I repeat, it is impossible. You may swell every expense and every effort
still more extravagantly; pile and accumulate every assistance you can buy or borrow; traffic
and barter with every little pitiful German prince that sells and sends his subjects to the
shambles of a foreign prince; your efforts are forever vain and impotent--doubly so from this
mercenary aid on which you rely; for it irritates, to an incurable resentment, the minds of
your enemies, to overrun them with the mercenary sons of rapine and plunder, devoting them
and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty! If I were an American, as I am an
Englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my arms--never--never--never.

But, my Lords, who is the man, that, in addition to these disgraces and mischiefs of our army,
has dared to authorize and associate to our arms the tomahawk and scalping-knife of the savage?
to call into civilized alliance the wild and inhuman savage of the woods; to delegate to the
merciless Indian the defence of disputed rights, and to wage the horrors of his barbarous war
against our brethren? My Lords, these enormities cry aloud for redress and punishment. Unless
thoroughly done away, it will be a stain on the national character. It is a violation of the
Constitution. I believe it is against law. It is not the least of our national misfortunes
that the strength and character of our army are thus impaired. Infected with the mercenary
spirit of robbery and rapine, familiarized to the horrid scenes of savage cruelty, it can no
longer boast of the noble and generous principles which dignify a soldier, no longer sympathize
with the dignity of the royal banner, nor feel the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious
war, "that make ambition virtue!" What makes ambition virtue?--the sense of honor. But is the
sense of honor consistent with a spirit of plunder, or the practice of murder? Can it flow
from mercenary motives, or can it prompt to cruel deeds?

The independent views of America have been stated and asserted as the foundation of this address.
My Lords, no man wishes for the due dependence of America on this country more than I do. To
preserve it, and not confirm that state of independence into which your measures hitherto have
driven them, is the object which we ought to unite in attaining. The Americans, contending
for their rights against arbitrary exactions, I love and admire. It is the struggle of free
and virtuous patriots. But, contending for independency and total disconnection from England,
as an Englishman, I cannot wish them success; for in a due constitutional dependency, including
the ancient supremacy of this country in regulating their commerce and navigation, consists
the mutual happiness and prosperity both of England and America. She derived assistance and
protection from us; and we reaped from her the most important advantages. She was, indeed,
the fountain of our wealth, the nerve of our strength, the nursery and basis of our naval power.
It is our duty, therefore, my Lords, if we wish to save our country, most seriously to endeavor
the recovery of these most beneficial subjects; and in this perilous crisis, perhaps the present
moment may be the only one in which we can hope for success. For in their negotiations with
France, they have, or think they have, reason to complain; though it be notorious that they
have received from that power important supplies and assistance of various kinds, yet it is
certain they expected it in a more decisive and immediate degree. America is in ill humor with
France; on some points they have not entirely answered her expectations. Let us wisely take
advantage of every possible moment of reconciliation. Besides, the natural disposition of America
herself still leans toward England; to the old habits of connection and mutual interest that
united both countries. This was the established sentiment of all the continent; and still,
my Lords, in the great and principal part, the sound part of America, this wise and affectionate
disposition prevails. And there is a very considerable part of America yet sound--the middle
and the southern provinces. Some parts may be factious and blind to their true interests; but
if we express a wise and benevolent disposition to communicate with them those immutable rights
of nature and those constitutional liberties to which they are equally entitled with ourselves,
by a conduct so just and humane we shall confirm the favorable and conciliate the adverse.
I say, my Lords, the rights and liberties to which they are equally entitled with ourselves,
but no more. I would participate to them every enjoyment and freedom which the colonizing subjects
of a free state can possess, or wish to possess; and I do not see why they should not enjoy
every fundamental right in their property, and every original substantial liberty, which Devonshire,
or Surrey, or the county I live in, or any other county in England, can claim; reserving always,
as the sacred right of the mother country, the due constitutional dependency of the colonies.
The inherent supremacy of the state in regulating and protecting the navigation and commerce
of all her subjects, is necessary for the mutual benefit and preservation of every part, to
constitute and preserve the prosperous arrangement of the whole empire.

The sound parts of America, of which I have spoken, must be sensible of these great truths
and of their real interests. America is not in that state of desperate and contemptible rebellion
which this country has been deluded to believe. It is not a wild and lawless banditti, who,
having nothing to lose, might hope to snatch something from public convulsions. Many of their
leaders and great men have a great stake in this great contest. The gentleman who conducts
their armies, I am told, has an estate of four or five thousand pounds a year; and when I consider
these things, I cannot but lament the inconsiderate violence of our penal acts, our declaration
of treason and rebellion, with all the fatal effects of attainder and confiscation.

As to the disposition of foreign powers which is asserted [in the King's speech] to be pacific
and friendly, let us judge, my Lords, rather by their actions and the nature of things than
by interested assertions. The uniform assistance supplied to America by France suggests a different
conclusion. The most important interests of France in aggrandizing and enriching herself with
what she most wants, supplies of every naval store from America, must inspire her with different
sentiments. The extraordinary preparations of the House of Bourbon, by land and by sea, from
Dunkirk to the Straits, equally ready and willing to overwhelm these defenceless islands, should
rouse us to a sense of their real disposition and our own danger. Not five thousand troops
in England! hardly three thousand in Ireland! What can we oppose to the combined force of our
enemies? Scarcely twenty ships of the line so fully or sufficiently manned, that any admiral's
reputation would permit him to take the command of. The river of Lisbon in the possession of
our enemies! The seas swept by American privateers! Our Channel trade torn to pieces by them!
In this complicated crisis of danger, weakness at home, and calamity abroad, terrified and
insulted by the neighboring powers, unable to act in America, or acting only to be destroyed,
where is the man with the forehead to promise or hope for success in such a situation, or from
perseverance in the measures that have driven us to it? Who has the forehead to do so? Where
is that man? I should be glad to see his face.

You cannot conciliate America by your present measures. You cannot subdue her by your present
or by any measures. What, then, can you do? You cannot conquer; you cannot gain; but you can
address; you can lull the fears and anxieties of the moment into an ignorance of the danger
that should produce them. But, my Lords, the time demands the language of truth. We must not
now apply the flattering unction of servile compliance or blind complaisance. In a just and
necessary war, to maintain the rights or honor of my country, I would strip the shirt from
my back to support it. But in such a war as this, unjust in its principle, impracticable in
its means, and ruinous in its consequences, I would not contribute a single effort nor a single
shilling. I do not call for vengeance on the heads of those who have been guilty; I only recommend
to them to make their retreat. Let them walk off; and let them make haste, or they may be assured
that speedy and condign punishment will overtake them.

My Lords, I have submitted to you, with the freedom and truth which I think my duty, my sentiments
on your present awful situation. I have laid before you the ruin of your power, the disgrace
of your reputation, the pollution of your discipline, the contamination of your morals, the
complication of calamities, foreign and domestic, that overwhelm your sinking country. Your
dearest interests, your own liberties, the Constitution itself totters to the foundation. All
this disgraceful danger, this multitude of misery, is the monstrous offspring of this unnatural
war. We have been deceived and deluded too long. Let us now stop short. This is the crisis--the
only crisis of time and situation, to give us a possibility of escape from the fatal effects
of our delusions. But if, in an obstinate and infatuated perseverance in folly, we slavishly
echo the peremptory words this day presented to us, nothing can save this devoted country from
complete and final ruin. We madly rush into multiplied miseries, and "confusion worse confounded."

Is it possible, can it be believed, that ministers are yet blind to this impending destruction?
I did hope, that instead of this false and empty vanity, this overweening pride, engendering
high conceits and presumptuous imaginations, ministers would have humbled themselves in their
errors, would have confessed and retracted them, and by an active, though a late, repentance,
have endeavored to redeem them. But, my Lords, since they had neither sagacity to foresee,
nor justice nor humanity to shun these oppressive calamities--since not even severe experience
can make them feel, nor the imminent ruin of their country awaken them from their stupefaction,
the guardian care of Parliament must interpose. I shall, therefore, my Lords, propose to you
an amendment of the address to his Majesty, to be inserted immediately after the two first
paragraphs of congratulation on the birth of a princess, to recommend an immediate cessation
of hostilities, and the commencement of a treaty to restore peace and liberty to America, strength
and happiness to England, security and permanent prosperity to both countries. This, my Lords,
is yet in our power; and let not the wisdom and justice of your Lordships neglect the happy,
and, perhaps, the only opportunity. By the establishment of irrevocable law, founded on mutual
rights, and ascertained by treaty, these glorious enjoyments may be firmly perpetuated. And
let me repeat to your Lordships, that the strong bias of America, at least of the wise and
sounder parts of it, naturally inclines to this happy and constitutional reconnection with
you. Notwithstanding the temporary intrigues with France, we may still be assured of their
ancient and confirmed partiality to us. America and France cannot be congenial.

My Lords, to encourage and confirm that innate inclination to this country, founded on every
principle of affection, as well as consideration of interest; to restore that favorable disposition
into a permanent and powerful reunion with this country; to revive the mutual strength of the
empire; again to awe the House of Bourbon, instead of meanly truckling, as our present calamities
compel us, to every insult of French caprice and Spanish punctilio; to re-establish our commerce;
to reassert our rights and our honor; to confirm our interests, and renew our glories forever--a
consummation most devoutly to be endeavored! and which, I trust, may yet arise from reconciliation
with America--I have the honor of submitting to you the following amendment, which I move to
be inserted after the two first paragraphs of the address:

    "And that this House does most humbly advise and supplicate his
    Majesty to be pleased to cause the most speedy and effectual
    measures to be taken for restoring peace in America; and that no
    time may be lost in proposing an immediate opening of a treaty
    for the final settlement of the tranquillity of these invaluable
    provinces, by a removal of the unhappy causes of this ruinous
    civil war, and by a just and adequate security against the
    return of the like calamities in times to come. And this House
    desire to offer the most dutiful assurances to his Majesty, that
    they will, in due time, cheerfully co-operate with the
    magnanimity and tender goodness of his Majesty for the
    preservation of his people, by such explicit and most solemn
    declarations, and provisions of fundamental and irrevocable
    laws, as may be judged necessary for the ascertaining and fixing
    forever the respective rights of Great Britain and her
    colonies."

XXII. FROM "THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD."

THE FAMILY USE ART, WHICH IS OPPOSED WITH STILL GREATER.

OLIVER GOLDSMITH.--1728-1774.

Whatever might have been Sophia's sensations, the rest of the family was easily consoled for
Mr. Burchell's absence by the company of our landlord, whose visits now became more frequent
and longer. Though he had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the
town, as he designed, he took every opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations
which our retirement would admit of. He usually came in the morning, and while my son and I
followed our occupations abroad, he sat with the family at home, and amused them by describing
the town, with every part of which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat all the
observations that were retailed in the atmosphere of the play-houses, and had all the good
things of the high wits by rote long before they made their way into the jest-books. The intervals
between conversation were employed in teaching my daughters piquet, or sometimes in setting
my two little ones to box to make them sharp, as he called it; but the hopes of having him
for a son-in-law, in some measure blinded us to all his imperfections. It must be owned that
my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him; or, to speak it more tenderly, used every art
to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the cakes at tea ate short and crisp, they were made
by Olivia: if the gooseberry wine was well knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering: it
was her fingers that gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in the composition of a pudding,
it was her judgment that mixed the ingredients. Then the poor woman would sometimes tell the
'squire, that she thought him and Olivia extremely of a size, and would bid both stand up to
see which was tallest. These instances of cunning, which she thought impenetrable, yet which
everybody saw through, were very pleasing to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs
of his passion, which, though they had not risen to proposals of marriage, yet we thought fell
but little short of it; and his slowness was attributed sometimes to native bashfulness, and
sometimes to his fear of offending his uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened soon after,
put it beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of our family; my wife even regarded it
as an absolute promise.

My wife and daughters happening to return a visit to neighbor Flamborough's, found that family
had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and took likenesses
for fifteen shillings a head. As this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in point of
taste, our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march upon us, and notwithstanding all I could
say, and I said much, it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too. Having, therefore,
engaged the limner, for what could I do? our next deliberation was to shew the superiority
of our taste in the attitudes. As for our neighbor's family, there were seven of them, and
they were drawn with seven oranges, a thing quite out of taste, no variety in life, no composition
in the world. We desired to have something in a brighter style, and after many debates, at
length came to an unanimous resolution of being drawn together in one large historical family
piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for all, and it would be infinitely
more genteel; for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same manner. As we did not
immediately recollect an historical subject to hit us, we were contented each with being drawn
as independent historical figures. My wife desired to be represented as Venus, and the painter
was desired not to be too frugal of his diamonds in her stomacher and hair. Her two little
ones were to be as Cupids by her side, while I, with my gown and band, was to present her with
my books on the Whistonian controversy. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, sitting upon a
bank of flowers, dressed in a green Joseph richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand.
Sophia was to be a shepherdess, with as many sheep as the painter could put in for nothing;
and Moses was to be dressed out with an hat and white feather. Our taste so much pleased the
'squire, that he insisted on being put in as one of the family, in the character of Alexander
the Great, at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us all as an indication of his desire to
be introduced into the family, nor could we refuse his request. The painter was therefore set
to work, and as he wrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than four days the whole
was completed. The piece was large, and it must be owned he did not spare his colors; for which
my wife gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly satisfied with his performance; but
an unfortunate circumstance had not occurred till the picture was finished, which now struck
us with dismay. It was so very large that we had no place in the house to fix it. How we all
came to disregard so material a point is inconceivable; but certain it is, we had been all
greatly remiss. The picture, therefore, instead of gratifying our vanity, as we hoped, leaned,
in a most mortifying manner, against the kitchen wall, where the canvas was stretched and painted,
much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the jest of all our neighbors. One compared
it to Robinson Crusoe's long-boat, too large to be removed; another thought it more resembled
a reel in a bottle; some wondered how it could be got out, but still more were amazed how it
ever got in.

But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually raised more malicious suggestions
in many. The 'squire's portrait being found united with ours, was an honor too great to escape
envy. Scandalous whispers began to circulate at our expense, and our tranquillity was continually
disturbed by persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us by enemies. These reports
we always resented with becoming spirit; but scandal ever improves by opposition.

We once again therefore entered into a consultation upon obviating the malice of our enemies,
and at last came to a resolution which had too much cunning to give me entire satisfaction.
It was this: as our principal object was to discover the honor of Mr. Thornhill's addresses,
my wife undertook to sound him by pretending to ask his advice in the choice of an husband
for her eldest daughter. If this was not found sufficient to induce him to a declaration, it
was then resolved to terrify him with a rival. To this last step, however, I would by no means
give my consent, till Olivia gave me the most solemn assurances that she would marry the person
provided to rival him upon this occasion, if he did not prevent it, by taking her himself.
Such was the scheme laid, which, though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not entirely approve.

The next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to see us, my girls took care to be out of
the way, in order to give their mamma an opportunity of putting her scheme in execution; but
they only retired to the next room, whence they could overhear the whole conversation: my wife
artfully introduced it, by observing, that one of the Miss Flamboroughs was like to have a
very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the 'squire assenting, she proceeded to remark,
that they who had warm fortunes were always sure of getting good husbands: "But heaven help,"
continued she, "the girls that have none. What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what signifies
all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of self-interest? It is
not, what is she? but, what has she? is all the cry."

"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the justice, as well as the novelty, of your remarks,
and if I were a king, it should be otherwise. It should then, indeed, be fine times for the
girls without fortunes: our two young ladies should be the first for whom I would provide."

"Ah, sir," returned my wife, "you are pleased to be facetious: but I wish I were a queen, and
then I know where my eldest daughter should look for an husband. But now that you have put
it into my head, seriously, Mr. Thornhill, can't you recommend me a proper husband for her?
She is now nineteen years old, well grown and well educated, and, in my humble opinion, does
not want for parts."

"Madam," replied he, "if I were to choose, I would find out a person possessed of every accomplishment
that can make an angel happy. One with prudence, fortune, taste, and sincerity; such, madam,
would be, in my opinion, the proper husband." "Ay, sir," said she, "but do you know of any
such person?"--"No, Madam," returned he, "it is impossible to know any person that deserves
to be her husband: she's too great a treasure for one man's possession: she's a goddess. Upon
my soul, I speak what I think, she's an angel"--"Ah, Mr. Thornhill, you only flatter my poor
girl: but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants, whose mother is lately
dead, and who wants a manager; you know whom I mean, farmer Williams; a warm man, Mr. Thornhill,
able to give her good bread; and who has several times made her proposals:" (which was actually
the case) "but, sir," concluded she, "I should be glad to have your approbation of our choice."--"How,
Madam," replied he, "my approbation! My approbation of such a choice! Never. What! Sacrifice
so much beauty and sense, and goodness, to a creature insensible of the blessing! Excuse me,
I can never approve of such a piece of injustice! And I have my reasons!"--"Indeed, sir," cried
Deborah, "If you have your reasons, that's another affair; but I should be glad to know those
reasons."--"Excuse me, madam," returned he, "they lie too deep for discovery;" (laying his
hand upon his bosom) "they remain buried, rivetted here."

After he was gone, upon general consultation, we could not tell what to make of these fine
sentiments. Olivia considered them as instances of the most exalted passion; but I was not
quite so sanguine: yet, whatever they might portend, it was resolved to prosecute the scheme
of farmer Williams, who, from my daughter's first appearance in the country, had paid her his
addresses.

XXIII. MEETING OF JOHNSON WITH WILKES.

(1776).

JAMES BOSWELL.--1740-1795.

From LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. Johnson. "Well, Sir, and what then? What care I for his patriotic
friends? Poh!" Boswell.

FOOTNOTES:

[E] Johnson's dislike of Mr. Wilkes was so great that it extended even to his connections.
He happened to dine one day at Sir Joshua Reynolds's with a large and distinguished company,
amongst whom were Mr. Wilkes's brother, Israel, and his lady. In the course of conversation,
Mr. Israel Wilkes was about to make some remark, when Johnson suddenly stopped him with, "I
hope, sir, what you are going to say may be better worth hearing than what you have already
said." This rudeness shocked and spread a gloom over the whole party, particularly as Mr. Israel
Wilkes was a gentleman of a very amiable character and of refined taste, and, what Dr. Johnson
little suspected, a very loyal subject. Johnson afterwards owned to me that he was very sorry
that he had "snubbed Wilkes, as his wife was present." I replied, that he should be sorry for
many reasons. "No," said Johnson, who was very reluctant to apologize for offences of this
nature; "no, I only regret it because his wife was by." I believe that he had no kind of motive
for this incivility to Mr. Israel Wilkes but disgust at his brother's political principles.

    MISS REYNOLDS'S RECOLLECTIONS.

XXIV. THE POLICY OF THE EMPIRE IN THE FIRST CENTURY.

EDWARD GIBBON.--1737-1794.

From THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

In the second century of the Christian era, the empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part
of the earth, and the most civilized portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive monarchy
were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valor. The gentle but powerful influence of
laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants
enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was
preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority,
and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period
of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities
of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines.

The principal conquests of the Romans were achieved under the republic; and the emperors, for
the most part, were satisfied with preserving those dominions which had been acquired by the
policy of the senate, the active emulation of the consuls, and the martial enthusiasm of the
people. The seven first centuries were filled with a rapid succession of triumphs; but it was
reserved for Augustus to relinquish the ambitious design of subduing the whole earth, and to
introduce a spirit of moderation into the public councils. Inclined to peace by his temper
and situation, it was easy for him to discover that Rome, in her present exalted situation,
had much less to hope than to fear from the chance of arms; and that, in the prosecution of
remote wars, the undertaking became every day more difficult, the event more doubtful, and
the possession more precarious and less beneficial. The experience of Augustus added weight
to these salutary reflections, and effectually convinced him that, by the prudent vigor of
his counsels, it would be easy to secure every concession which the safety or the dignity of
Rome might require from the most formidable barbarians. Instead of exposing his person and
his legions to the arrows of the Parthians, he obtained, by an honorable treaty, the restitution
of the standards and prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of Crassus.

His generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the reduction of Æthiopia and Arabia
Felix. They marched near a thousand miles to the south of the tropic; but the heat of the climate
soon repelled the invaders, and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered regions.
The northern countries of Europe scarcely deserved the expense and labor of conquest. The forests
and morasses of Germany were filled with a hardy race of barbarians, who despised life when
it was separated from freedom; and though, on the first attack, they seemed to yield to the
weight of the Roman power, they soon, by a signal act of despair, regained their independence,
and reminded Augustus of the vicissitude of fortune. On the death of that emperor, his testament
was publicly read in the senate. He bequeathed, as a valuable legacy to his successors, the
advice of confining the empire within those limits which nature seemed to have placed as its
permanent bulwarks and boundaries: on the west the Atlantic Ocean; the Rhine and Danube on
the north; the Euphrates on the east; and towards the south, the sandy deserts of Arabia and
Africa.

Happily for the repose of mankind, the moderate system recommended by the wisdom of Augustus
was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate successors. Engaged in the pursuit of pleasure,
or in the exercise of tyranny, the first Cæsars seldom showed themselves to the armies or to
the provinces; nor were they disposed to suffer that those triumphs which their indolence neglected
should be usurped by the conduct and valor of their lieutenants. The military fame of a subject
was considered as an insolent invasion of the imperial prerogative; and it became the duty,
as well as interest, of every Roman general to guard the frontiers intrusted to his care, without
aspiring to conquests which might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished
barbarians.

The only accession which the Roman empire received during the first century of the Christian
era was the province of Britain. In this single instance the successors of Cæsar and Augustus
were persuaded to follow the example of the former, rather than the precept of the latter.
The proximity of its situation to the coast of Gaul seemed to invite their arms; the pleasing,
though doubtful, intelligence of a pearl-fishery attracted their avarice; and as Britain was
viewed in the light of a distinct and insulated world, the conquest scarcely formed any exception
to the general system of continental measures. After a war of about forty years, undertaken
by the most stupid, maintained by the most dissolute, and terminated by the most timid of all
the emperors, the far greater part of the island submitted to the Roman yoke. The various tribes
of Britons possessed valor without conduct, and the love of freedom without the spirit of union.
They took up arms with savage fierceness; they laid them down, or turned them against each
other, with wild inconstancy; and while they fought singly, they were successively subdued.
Neither the fortitude of Caractacus, nor the despair of Boadicea, nor the fanaticism of the
Druids, could avert the slavery of their country, or resist the steady progress of the imperial
generals, who maintained the national glory, when the throne was disgraced by the weakest or
the most vicious of mankind. At the very time when Domitian, confined to his palace, felt the
terrors which he inspired, his legions, under the command of the virtuous Agricola, defeated
the collected force of the Caledonians at the foot of the Grampian hills; and his fleets, venturing
to explore an unknown and dangerous navigation, displayed the Roman arms round every part of
the island. The conquest of Britain was considered as already achieved; and it was the design
of Agricola to complete and insure his success by the easy reduction of Ireland, for which,
in his opinion, one legion and a few auxiliaries were sufficient. The western isle might be
improved into a valuable possession, and the Britons would wear their chains with the less
reluctance, if the prospect and example of freedom was on every side removed from before their
eyes.

But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his removal from the government of Britain;
and forever disappointed this rational, though extensive, scheme of conquest. Before his departure
the prudent general had provided for security as well as for dominion. He had observed that
the island is almost divided into two unequal parts by the opposite gulfs, or, as they are
now called, the Friths of Scotland. Across the narrow interval of about forty miles he had
drawn a line of military stations, which was afterwards fortified, in the reign of Antoninus
Pius, by a turf rampart, erected on foundations of stone. This wall of Antoninus, at a small
distance beyond the modern cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, was fixed as the limit of the Roman
province. The native Caledonians preserved, in the northern extremity of the island, their
wild independence, for which they were not less indebted to their poverty than to their valor.
Their incursions were frequently repelled and chastised, but their country was never subdued.
The masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of the globe turned with contempt from
gloomy hills assailed by the winter tempest, from lakes concealed in a blue mist, and from
cold and lonely heaths, over which the deer of the forest were chased by a troop of naked barbarians.

Such was the state of the Roman frontiers, and such the maxims of imperial policy, from the
death of Augustus to the accession of Trajan.

XXV. ON THE ATTACKS UPON HIS PENSION.[F]

EDMUND BURKE.--1729-1797.

In one thing I can excuse the Duke of Bedford for his attack upon me and my mortuary pension:
He cannot readily comprehend the transaction he condemns. What I have obtained was the fruit
of no bargain, the production of no intrigue, the result of no compromise, the effect of no
solicitation. The first suggestion of it never came from me, mediately or immediately, to his
Majesty or any of his ministers. It was long known that the instant my engagements would permit
it, and before the heaviest of all calamities had forever condemned me to obscurity and sorrow,
I had resolved on a total retreat. I had executed that design. I was entirely out of the way
of serving or of hurting any statesman or any party, when the ministers so generously and so
nobly carried into effect the spontaneous bounty of the crown. Both descriptions have acted
as became them. When I could no longer serve them, the ministers have considered my situation.
When I could no longer hurt them, the revolutionists have trampled on my infirmity. My gratitude,
I trust, is equal to the manner in which the benefit was conferred. It came to me, indeed,
at a time of life, and in a state of mind and body, in which no circumstance of fortune could
afford me any real pleasure. But this was no fault in the royal donor, or in his ministers,
who were pleased, in acknowledging the merits of an invalid servant of the public, to assuage
the sorrows of a desolate old man....

I was not like his Grace of Bedford, swaddled, and rocked, and dandled into a legislator: "Nitor
in adversum" is the motto for a man like me. I possessed not one of the qualities, nor cultivated
one of the arts, that recommend men to the favor and protection of the great. I was not made
for a minion or a tool. As little did I follow the trade of winning the hearts by imposing
on the understandings of the people. At every step of my progress in life--for in every step
was I traversed and opposed--and at every turnpike I met, I was obliged to shew my passport,
and again and again to prove my sole title to the honor of being useful to my country, by a
proof that I was not wholly unacquainted with its laws, and the whole system of its interests
both abroad and at home. Otherwise, no rank, no toleration even, for me. I had no arts but
manly arts. On them I have stood, and, please God, in spite of the Duke of Bedford and the
Earl of Lauderdale, to the last gasp will I stand....

The Duke of Bedford conceives that he is obliged to call the attention of the House of Peers
to his Majesty's grant to me, which he considers as excessive and out of all bounds.

I know not how it has happened, but it really seems, that, whilst his Grace was meditating
his well-considered censure upon me, he fell into a sort of sleep. Homer nods, and the Duke
of Bedford may dream; and as dreams--even his golden dreams--are apt to be ill-pieced and incongruously
put together, his Grace preserved his idea of reproach to me, but took the subject-matter from
the crown grants to his own family. This is "the stuff of which his dreams are made." In that
way of putting things together, his Grace is perfectly in the right. The grants to the house
of Russell were so enormous, as not only to outrage economy, but even to stagger credibility.
The Duke of Bedford is the leviathan among all the creatures of the crown. He tumbles about
his unwieldy bulk; he plays and frolics in the ocean of the royal bounty. Huge as he is, and
whilst "he lies floating many a rood," he is still a creature. His ribs, his fins, his whalebone,
his blubber, the very spiracles through which he spouts a torrent of brine against his origin,
and covers me all over with the spray--everything of him and about him is from the throne.
Is it for him to question the dispensation of the royal favor?

I really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public merits of his Grace,
by which he justifies the grants he holds, and these services of mine, on the favorable construction
of which I have obtained what his Grace so much disapproves. In private life I have not at
all the honor of acquaintance with the noble Duke; but I ought to presume, and it costs me
nothing to do so, that he abundantly deserves the esteem and love of all who live with him.
But as to public service, why, truly, it would not be more ridiculous for me to compare myself,
in rank, in fortune, in splendid descent, in youth, strength, or figure, with the Duke of Bedford,
than to make a parallel between his services and my attempts to be useful to my country. It
would not be gross adulation, but uncivil irony, to say that he has any public merit of his
own to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed pensions were obtained.
My merits, whatever they are, are original and personal: his are derivative. It is his ancestor,
the original pensioner, that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit, which makes his
Grace so very delicate and exceptious about the merit of all other grantees of the crown. Had
he permitted me to remain in quiet, I should have said: "'Tis his estate; that's enough. It
is his by law; what have I to do with it or its history?" He would naturally have said on his
side: "'Tis this man's fortune. He is as good now as my ancestor was two hundred and fifty
years ago. I am a young man with very old pensions: he is an old man with very young pensions--that's
all."

Why will his Grace, by attacking me, force me reluctantly to compare my little merit with that
which obtained from the crown those prodigies of profuse donation by which he tramples on the
mediocrity of humble and laborious individuals?... Since the new grantees have war made on
them by the old, and that the word of the sovereign is not to be taken, let us turn our eyes
to history, in which great men have always a pleasure in contemplating the heroic origin of
their house.

The first peer of the name, the first purchaser of the grants, was a Mr. Russell, a person
of an ancient gentleman's family, raised by being a minion of Henry the Eighth. As there generally
is some resemblance of character to create these relations, the favorite was in all likelihood
much such another as his master. The first of those immoderate grants was not taken from the
ancient demesne of the crown, but from the recent confiscation of the ancient nobility of the
land. The lion, having sucked the blood of his prey, threw the offal carcass to the jackal
in waiting. Having tasted once the food of confiscation, the favorites became fierce and ravenous.
This worthy favorite's first grant was from the lay nobility. The second, infinitely improving
on the enormity of the first, was from the plunder of the church. In truth, his Grace is somewhat
excusable for his dislike to a grant like mine, not only in its quantity, but in its kind,
so different from his own.

Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign: his, from Henry the Eighth. Mine had not its
fund in the murder of any innocent person of illustrious rank, or in the pillage of any body
of unoffending men: his grants were from the aggregate and consolidated funds of judgments
iniquitously legal, and from possessions voluntarily surrendered by the lawful proprietors
with the gibbet at their door.

The merit of the grantee whom he derives from, was that of being a prompt and greedy instrument
of a levelling tyrant, who oppressed all descriptions of his people, but who fell with particular
fury on everything that was great and noble. Mine has been in endeavoring to screen every man,
in every class, from oppression, and particularly in defending the high and eminent, who, in
the bad times of confiscating princes, confiscating chief-governors, or confiscating demagogues,
are the most exposed to jealousy, avarice, and envy.

The merit of the original grantee of his Grace's pensions was in giving his hand to the work,
and partaking the spoil with a prince who plundered a part of the national church of his time
and country. Mine was in defending the whole of the national church of my own time and my own
country, and the whole of the national churches of all countries, from the principles and the
examples which lead to ecclesiastical pillage, thence to a contempt of all prescriptive titles,
thence to the pillage of all property, and thence to universal desolation.

The merit of the origin of his Grace's fortune was in being a favorite and chief adviser to
a prince who left no liberty to his native country. My endeavor was to obtain liberty for the
municipal country in which I was born, and for all descriptions and denominations in it. Mine
was to support, with unrelaxing vigilance, every right, every privilege, every franchise, in
this my adopted, my dearer, and more comprehensive country; and not only to preserve those
rights in this chief seat of empire, but in every nation, in every land, in every climate,
language, and religion, in the vast domain that still is under the protection, and the larger
that was once under the protection, of the British crown.

His founder's merits were, by arts in which he served his master and made his fortune, to bring
poverty, wretchedness, and depopulation on his country. Mine were under a benevolent prince,
in promoting the commerce, manufactures, and agriculture of his kingdom.

His founder's merit was the merit of a gentleman raised by the arts of a court and the protection
of a Wolsey to the eminence of a great and potent lord. His merit in that eminence was, by
instigating a tyrant to injustice, to provoke a people to rebellion. My merit was, to awaken
the sober part of the country, that they might put themselves on their guard against any one
potent lord, or any greater number of potent lords, or any combination of great leading men
of any sort, if ever they should attempt to proceed in the same courses, but in the reverse
order,--that is, by instigating a corrupted populace to rebellion, and, through that rebellion,
introducing a tyranny yet worse than the tyranny which his Grace's ancestor supported, and
of which he profited in the manner we behold in the despotism of Henry the Eighth.

The political merit of the first pensioner of his Grace's house was that of being concerned
as a counsellor of state in advising, and in his person executing, the conditions of a dishonorable
peace with France,--the surrendering of the fortress of Boulogne, then our outguard on the
Continent. By that surrender, Calais, the key of France, and the bridle in the mouth of that
power, was not many years afterwards finally lost. My merit has been in resisting the power
and pride of France, under any form of its rule; but in opposing it with the greatest zeal
and earnestness, when that rule appeared in the worst form it could assume,--the worst, indeed,
which the prime cause and principle of all evil could possibly give it. It was my endeavor
by every means to excite a spirit in the House, where I had the honor of a seat, for carrying
on with early vigor and decision the most clearly just and necessary war that this or any nation
ever carried on, in order to save my country from the iron yoke of its power, and from the
more dreadful contagion of its principles,--to preserve, while they can be preserved, pure
and untainted, the ancient, inbred integrity, piety, good-nature, and good-humor of the people
of England, from the dreadful pestilence which, beginning in France, threatens to lay waste
the whole moral and in a great degree the whole physical world, having done both in the focus
of its most intense malignity.

The labors of his Grace's founder merited the "curses, not loud, but deep," of the Commons
of England, on whom he and his master had effected a complete Parliamentary Reform, by making
them, in their slavery and humiliation, the true and adequate representatives of a debased,
degraded, and undone people. My merits were in having had an active, though not always an ostentatious
share, in every one act, without exception, of undisputed constitutional utility in my time,
and in having supported, on all occasions, the authority, the efficiency, and the privileges
of the Commons of Great Britain. I ended my services by a recorded and fully reasoned assertion
on their own journals of their constitutional rights, and a vindication of their constitutional
conduct. I labored in all things to merit their inward approbation, and (along with the assistants
of the largest, the greatest, and best of my endeavors) I received their free, unbiased, public,
and solemn thanks.

Thus stands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants which compose the Duke
of Bedford's fortune, as balanced against mine. 1796.

XXVI. TWO EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SCENES.

WILLIAM COWPER.--1731-1800.

From letters to the Rev. John Newton.

Nov. 17th, 1783.

... Since our conflagration here, we have sent two women and a boy to the justice, for depredation;
S. R. for stealing a piece of beef, which, in her excuse, she said she intended to take care
of. This lady, whom you well remember, escaped for want of evidence; not that evidence was
wanting, but our men of Gotham judged it unnecessary to send it. With her went the woman I
mentioned before, who, it seems, has made some sort of profession, but upon this occasion allowed
herself a latitude of conduct rather inconsistent with it, having filled her apron with wearing-apparel,
which she likewise intended to take care of. She would have gone to the county gaol, had William
Raban, the baker's son, who prosecuted, insisted upon it; but he, good-naturedly, though I
think weakly, interposed in her favor, and begged her off. The young gentleman who accompanied
these fair ones is the junior son of Molly Boswell. He had stolen some iron-work, the property
of Griggs the butcher. Being convicted, he was ordered to be whipped, which operation he underwent
at the cart's tail, from the stone-house to the high arch, and back again. He seemed to show
great fortitude, but it was all an imposition upon the public. The beadle, who performed it,
had filled his left hand with yellow ochre, through which, after every stroke, he drew the
lash of his whip, leaving the appearance of a wound upon the skin, but in reality not hurting
him at all. This being perceived by Mr. Constable H., who followed the beadle, he applied his
cane, without any such management or precaution, to the shoulders of the too merciful executioner.
The scene immediately became more interesting. The beadle could by no means be prevailed upon
to strike hard, which provoked the constable to strike harder; and this double flogging continued,
till a lass of Silver-End, pitying the pitiful beadle thus suffering under the hands of the
pitiless constable, joined the procession, and placing herself immediately behind the latter,
seized him by his capillary club, and pulling him backwards by the same, slapped his face with
a most Amazon fury. This concatenation of events has taken up more of my paper than I intended
it should, but I could not forbear to inform you how the beadle thrashed the thief, the constable
the beadle, and the lady the constable, and how the thief was the only person concerned who
suffered nothing.

March 29th, 1784.

It being his Majesty's pleasure, that I should yet have another opportunity to write before
he dissolves the Parliament, I avail myself of it with all possible alacrity. I thank you for
your last, which was not the less welcome for coming, like an extraordinary gazette, at a time
when it was not expected.

As when the sea is uncommonly agitated, the water finds its way into creeks and holes of rocks,
which in its calmer state it never reaches, in like manner the effect of these turbulent times
is felt even at Orchard Side, where in general we live as undisturbed by the political element
as shrimps or cockles that have been accidentally deposited in some hollow beyond the water-mark,
by the usual dashing of the waves. We were sitting yesterday after dinner, the two ladies and
myself, very composedly, and without the least apprehension of any such intrusion in our snug
parlor, one lady knitting, the other netting, and the gentleman winding worsted, when to our
unspeakable surprise a mob appeared before the window; a smart rap was heard at the door, the
boys bellowed, and the maid announced Mr. Grenville. Puss was unfortunately let out of her
box, so that the candidate, with all his good friends at his heels, was refused admittance
at the grand entry, and referred to the back door, as the only possible way of approach.

Candidates are creatures not very susceptible of affronts, and would rather, I suppose, climb
in at the window, than be absolutely excluded. In a minute, the yard, the kitchen, and the
parlor were filled. Mr. Grenville, advancing toward me, shook me by the hand with a degree
of cordiality that was extremely seducing. As soon as he, and as many more as could find chairs,
were seated, he began to open the intent of his visit. I told him I had no vote, for which
he readily gave me credit. I assured him I had no influence, which he was not equally inclined
to believe, and the less, no doubt, because Mr. Ashburner, the draper, addressing himself to
me at this moment, informed me that I had a great deal. Supposing that I could not be possessed
of such a treasure without knowing it, I ventured to affirm my first assertion, by saying,
that if I had any I was utterly at a loss to imagine where it could be, or wherein it consisted.
Thus ended the conference. Mr. Grenville squeezed me by the hand again, kissed the ladies,
and withdrew. He kissed likewise the maid in the kitchen, and seemed upon the whole a most
loving, kissing, kind-hearted gentleman. He is very young, genteel, and handsome. He has a
pair of very good eyes in his head, which not being sufficient, as it should seem, for the
many nice and difficult purposes of a senator, he has a third also, which he suspended from
his buttonhole. The boys halloo'd, the dogs barked, puss scampered, the hero, with his long
train of obsequious followers, withdrew. We made ourselves very merry with the adventure, and
in a short time settled into our former tranquillity, never probably to be thus interrupted
more. I thought myself, however, happy in being able to affirm truly that I had not that influence
for which he sued; and which, had I been possessed of it, with my present views of the dispute
between the Crown and the Commons, I must have refused him, for he is on the side of the former.
It is comfortable to be of no consequence in a world where one cannot exercise any without
disobliging somebody. The town, however, seems to be much at his service, and if he be equally
successful throughout the country, he will undoubtedly gain his election. Mr. Ashburner, perhaps,
was a little mortified, because it was evident I owed the honor of this visit to his misrepresentation
of my importance. But had he thought proper to assure Mr. Grenville that I had three heads,
I should not, I suppose, have been bound to produce them....

       *       *       *       *       *

    Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,
    Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,
    And while the bubbling and loud hissing urn
    Throws up a steamy column, and the cups
    That cheer but not inebriate wait on each,
    So let us welcome peaceful evening in.

XXVII. FROM "THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL."[G]

RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN.--1751-1816.

SCENE.--A Room in SIR PETER TEAZLE'S House.

Enter SIR PETER TEAZLE.

Sir Pet. When an old bachelor marries a young wife, what is he to expect? 'Tis now six months
since Lady Teazle made me the happiest of men--and I have been the most miserable dog ever
since. We tiffed a little going to church, and fairly quarrelled before the bells had done
ringing. I was more than once nearly choked with gall during the honeymoon, and had lost all
comfort in life before my friends had done wishing me joy. Yet I chose with caution--a girl
bred wholly in the country, who never knew luxury beyond one silk gown, nor dissipation above
the annual gala of a race ball. Yet she now plays her part in all the extravagant fopperies
of fashion and the town with as ready a grace as if she never had seen a bush or a grass-plot
out of Grosvenor Square! I am sneered at by all my acquaintance, and paragraphed in the newspapers.
She dissipates my fortune, and contradicts all my humors; yet the worst of it is, I doubt I
love her, or I should never bear all this. However, I'll never be weak enough to own it. But
I meet with nothing but crosses and vexations--and the fault is entirely hers. I am, myself,
the sweetest-tempered man alive, and hate a teasing temper; and so I tell her a hundred times
a day.--Ay! and what is very extraordinary, in all our disputes she is always in the wrong.
But Lady Sneerwell, and the set she meets at her house, encourage the perverseness of her disposition.
Then, to complete my vexation, Maria, my ward, whom I ought to have the power of a father over,
is determined to turn rebel too, and absolutely refuses the man whom I have long resolved on
for her husband--

Enter LADY TEAZLE.

Lady Teazle, Lady Teazle, I'll not bear it!

Lady Teaz. Sir Peter, Sir Peter, you may bear it or not, as you please; but I ought to have
my own way in everything, and, what's more, I will too. What! though I was educated in the
country, I know very well that women of fashion in London are accountable to nobody after they
are married.

Sir Pet. Very well, ma'am, very well; so a husband is to have no influence, no authority?

Lady Teaz. Authority! No, to be sure. If you wanted authority over me, you should have adopted
me, and not married me: I am sure you were old enough.

Sir Pet. Old enough!--ay, there it is. Well, well, Lady Teazle, though my life may be made
unhappy by your temper, I'll not be ruined by your extravagance!

Lady Teaz. My extravagance! I'm sure I'm not more extravagant than a woman of fashion ought to be.

Sir Pet. No, no, madam, you shall throw away no more sums on such unmeaning luxury. Such wastefulness!
to spend as much to furnish your dressing-room with flowers in winter as would suffice to turn
the Pantheon into a greenhouse, and give a fête champêtre at Christmas.

Lady Teaz. And am I to blame, Sir Peter, because flowers are dear in cold weather? You should
find fault with the climate, and not with me. For my part, I'm sure I wish it was spring all
the year round, and that roses grew under our feet.

Sir Pet. Oons! madam--if you had been born to this, I shouldn't wonder at your talking thus;
but you forget what your situation was when I married you.

Lady Teaz. No, no, I don't; 'twas a very disagreeable one, or I should never have married you.

Sir Pet. Yes, yes, madam, you were then in somewhat a humbler style--the daughter of a plain
country squire. Recollect, Lady Teazle, when I saw you first sitting at your tambour, in a
pretty figured linen gown, with a bunch of keys at your side, your hair combed smooth over
a roll, and your apartment hung round with fruits in worsted, of your own working.

Lady Teaz. Oh, yes! I remember it very well, and a curious life I led. My daily occupation--to
inspect the dairy, superintend the poultry, make extracts from the family receipt-book, and
comb my aunt Deborah's lap-dog.

Sir Pet. Yes, yes, ma'am, 'twas so indeed.

Lady Teaz. And then you know my evening amusements! To draw patterns for ruffles, which I had
not materials to make up; to play Pope Joan with the curate; to read a sermon to my aunt; or
to be stuck down to an old spinet to strum my father to sleep after a fox-chase.

Sir Pet. I am glad you have so good a memory. Yes, madam, these were the recreations I took
you from; but now you must have your coach--vis-à-vis--and three powdered footmen before your
chair; and, in the summer, a pair of white cats to draw you to Kensington Gardens. No recollection,
I suppose, when you were content to ride double, behind the butler, on a docked coach-horse.

Lady Teaz. No--I vow I never did that: I deny the butler and the coach-horse.

Sir Pet. This, madam, was your situation; and what have I done for you? I have made you a woman
of fashion, of fortune, of rank--in short, I have made you my wife.

Lady Teaz. Well, then, and there is but one thing more you can make me to add to the obligation,
that is----

Sir Pet. My widow, I suppose?

Lady Teaz. Hem! hem!

Sir Pet. I thank you, madam--but don't flatter yourself; for, though your ill conduct may disturb
my peace of mind, it shall never break my heart, I promise you: however, I am equally obliged
to you for the hint.

Lady Teaz. Then why will you endeavor to make yourself so disagreeable to me, and thwart me
in every little elegant expense?

Sir Pet. Madam, I say, had you any of these little elegant expenses when you married me?

Lady Teaz. Sir Peter! would you have me be out of the fashion?

Sir Pet. The fashion, indeed! what had you to do with the fashion before you married me?

Lady Teaz. For my part, I should think you would like to have your wife thought a woman of taste.

Sir Pet. Ay--there again--taste! Zounds! madam, you had no taste when you married me!

Lady Teaz. That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter! and after having married you, I should never
pretend to taste again, I allow. But now, Sir Peter, since we have finished our daily jangle,
I presume I may go to my engagement at Lady Sneerwell's.

Sir Pet. Ay, there's another precious circumstance--a charming set of acquaintances you have
made there!

Lady Teaz. Nay, Sir Peter, they are all people of rank and fortune, and remarkably tenacious
of reputation.

Sir Pet. Yes, they are tenacious of reputation with a vengeance; for they don't choose anybody
should have a character but themselves! Such a crew! Ah! many a wretch has rid on a hurdle
who has done less mischief than these utterers of forged tales; coiners of scandal, and clippers
of reputation.

Lady Teaz. What, would you restrain the freedom of speech?

Sir Pet. Ah! they have made you just as bad as any one of the society.

Lady Teaz. Why, I believe I do bear a part with a tolerable grace.

Sir Pet. Grace, indeed!

Lady Teaz. But I vow I bear no malice against the people I abuse; when I say an ill-natured
thing, 'tis out of pure good humor; and I take it for granted they deal exactly in the same
manner with me. But, Sir Peter, you know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell's too.

Sir Pet. Well, well, I'll call in, just to look after my own character.

Lady Teaz. Then, indeed, you must make haste after me, or you'll be too late. So good-bye to
ye.      [Exit.

Sir Pet. So--I have gained much by my intended expostulation! Yet with what a charming air
she contradicts everything I say; and how pleasantly she shows her contempt for my authority!
Well, though I can't make her love me; there is great satisfaction in quarrelling with her;
and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she is doing everything in her power
to plague me.      [Exit.

SCENE.--A room in LADY SNEERWELL'S House.

LADY SNEERWELL, MRS. CANDOUR, CRABTREE, SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE, and JOSEPH SURFACE, discovered.

Enter LADY TEAZLE and MARIA.

Lady Sneer. Lady Teazle, I hope we shall see Sir Peter?

Lady Teaz. I believe he'll wait on your ladyship presently.

Lady Sneer. Maria, my love, you look grave. Come, you shall sit down to piquet with Mr. Surface.

Mar. I take very little pleasure in cards--however, I'll do as your ladyship pleases.

Mrs. Can. Now I'll die; but you are so scandalous, I'll forswear your society.

Lady Teaz. What's the matter, Mrs. Candour?

Mrs. Can. They'll not allow our friend Miss Vermillion to be handsome.

Lady Sneer. Oh, surely she is a pretty woman.

Crab. I am very glad you think so, ma'am.

Mrs. Can. She has a charming fresh color.

Lady Teaz. Yes, when it is fresh put on.

Mrs. Can. Oh, fie! Her color is natural: I have seen it come and go!

Lady Teaz. I dare say you have, ma'am: it goes off at night, and comes again in the morning.

Sir Ben. True, ma'am, it not only comes and goes; but, what's more, her maid can fetch and
carry it!

Mrs. Can. Ha! ha! ha! how I hate to hear you talk so! But surely now, her sister is, or was,
very handsome.

Crab. Who? Mrs. Evergreen? Oh! she's six-and-fifty if she's an hour!

Mrs. Can. Now positively you wrong her; fifty-two or fifty-three is the utmost--and I don't
think she looks more.

Sir Ben. Ah! there's no judging by her looks, unless one could see her face.

Lady Sneer. Well, well, if Mrs. Evergreen does take some pains to repair the ravages of time,
you must allow she effects it with great ingenuity; and surely that's better than the careless
manner in which the widow Ochre caulks her wrinkles.

Sir Ben. Nay, now, Lady Sneerwell, you are severe upon the widow. Come, come, 'tis not that
she paints so ill--but, when she has finished her face, she joins it on so badly to her neck,
that she looks like a mended statue, in which the connoisseur may see at once that the head
is modern, though the trunk's antique.

Crab. Ha! ha! ha! Well said, nephew!

Mrs. Can. Ha! ha! ha! Well, you make me laugh; but I vow I hate you for it. What do you think
of Miss Simper?

Sir Ben. Why, she has very pretty teeth.

Lady Teaz. Yes, and on that account, when she is neither speaking nor laughing (which very
seldom happens), she never absolutely shuts her mouth, but leaves it always on a-jar, as it
were--thus.

[Shows her teeth.

Mrs. Can. How can you be so ill-natured?

Lady Teaz. Nay, I allow even that's better than the pains Mrs. Prim takes to conceal her losses
in front. She draws her mouth till it positively resembles the aperture of a poor's-box, and
all her words appear to slide out edgewise as it were--thus: How do you do, madam? Yes, madam.
[Mimics.

Lady Sneer. Very well, Lady Teazle; I see you can be a little severe.

Lady Teaz. In defence of a friend it is but justice. But here comes Sir Peter to spoil our
pleasantry.

Enter SIR PETER TEAZLE.

Sir Pet. Ladies, your most obedient.--[Aside,] Mercy on me, here is the whole set! a character
dead at every word, I suppose.

Mrs. Can. I am rejoiced you are come, Sir Peter. They have been so censorious--and Lady Teazle
as bad as any one.

Sir Pet. That must be very distressing to you, indeed, Mrs. Candour.

Mrs. Can. Oh, they will allow good qualities to nobody: not even good nature to our friend
Mrs. Pursy.

Lady Teaz. What, the fat dowager who was at Mrs. Quadrille's last night?

Mrs. Can. Nay, her bulk is her misfortune; and, when she takes so much pains to get rid of
it, you ought not to reflect on her.

Lady Sneer. That's very true, indeed.

Lady Teaz. Yes, I know she almost lives on acids and small whey; laces herself by pulleys;
and often, in the hottest noon in summer, you may see her on a little squat pony, with her
hair plaited up behind like a drummer's, and puffing round the ring on a full trot.

Mrs. Can. I thank you, Lady Teazle, for defending her.

Sir Pet. Yes, a good defence, truly.

Mrs. Can. Truly, Lady Teazle is as censorious as Miss Sallow.

Crab. Yes, and she is a curious being to pretend to be censorious--an awkward thing, without
any one good point under the sun.

Mrs. Can. Positively you shall not be so very severe. Miss Sallow is a near relation of mine
by marriage, and, as for her person, great allowance is to be made; for, let me tell you, a
woman labors under many disadvantages who tries to pass for a girl of six-and-thirty.

Lady Sneer. Though, surely, she is handsome still--and for the weakness in her eyes, considering
how much she reads by candlelight, it is not to be wondered at.

Mrs. Can. True, and then as to her manner; upon my word I think it is particularly graceful,
considering she never had the least education; for you know her mother was a Welsh milliner,
and her father a sugar-baker at Bristol.

Sir Ben. Ah! you are both of you too good-natured!

Sir Pet. Yes, distressingly good-natured! This their own relation! Mercy on me!      [Aside.

Mrs. Can. For my part, I own I cannot bear to hear a friend ill-spoken of.

Sir Pet. No, to be sure!

Sir Ben. Oh! you are of a moral turn. Mrs. Candour and I can sit for an hour and hear Lady
Stucco talk sentiment.

Lady Teas. Nay, I vow Lady Stucco is very well with the dessert after dinner; for she's just
like the French fruit one cracks for mottoes--made up of paint and proverb.

Mrs. Can. Well, I will never join in ridiculing a friend; and so I constantly tell my cousin
Ogle, and you all know what pretensions she has to be critical on beauty.

Crab. Oh, to be sure! she has herself the oddest countenance that ever was seen; 'tis a collection
of features from all the different countries of the globe.

Sir Ben. So she has, indeed--an Irish front----

Crab. Caledonian locks----

Sir Ben. Dutch nose----

Crab. Austrian lips----

Sir Ben. Complexion of a Spaniard----

Crab. And teeth à la Chinoise.

Sir Ben. In short, her face resembles a table d'hôte at Spa--where no two guests are of a nation----

Crab. Or a congress at the close of a general war--wherein all the members, even to her eyes,
appear to have a different interest, and her nose and chin are the only parties likely to join
issue.

Mrs. Can. Ha! ha! ha!

Sir Pet. Mercy on my life!--a person they dine with twice a week!      [Aside.

Mrs. Can. Nay, but I vow you shall not carry the laugh off so--for give me leave to say that
Mrs. Ogle----

Sir Pet. Madam, madam, I beg your pardon--there's no stopping these good gentlemen's tongues.
But when I tell you, Mrs. Candour, that the lady they are abusing is a particular friend of
mine, I hope you'll not take her part.

Lady Sneer. Ha! ha! ha! well said, Sir Peter! but you are a cruel creature--too phlegmatic
yourself for a jest, and too peevish to allow wit in others.

Sir Pet. Ah, madam, true wit is more nearly allied to good nature than your ladyship is aware of.

Lady Teas. True, Sir Peter; I believe they are so near akin that they can never be united.

Sir Ben. Or rather, suppose them man and wife, because one seldom sees them together.

Lady Teaz. But Sir Peter is such an enemy to scandal, I believe he would have it put down by
parliament.

Sir Pet. Positively, madam, if they were to consider the sporting with reputation of as much
importance as poaching on manors, and pass an act for the preservation of fame, as well as
game, I believe many would thank them for the bill.

Lady Sneer. Why! Sir Peter; would you deprive us of our privileges?

Sir Pet. Ay, madam; and then no person should be permitted to kill characters and run down
reputations but qualified old maids and disappointed widows.

Lady Sneer. Go, you monster!

Mrs. Can. But, surely, you would not be quite so severe on those who only report what they hear?

Sir Pet. Yes, madam, I would have law merchant for them too; and in all cases of slander currency,
whenever the drawer of the lie was not to be found, the injured parties should have a right
to come on any of the indorsers.

Crab. Well, for my part, I believe there never was a scandalous tale without some foundation.

Lady Sneer. Come, ladies, shall we sit down to cards in the next room?

Enter Servant, who whispers Sir Peter.

Sir Pet. I'll be with them directly.--[Exit SERVANT.] I'll get away unperceived.      [Aside.

Lady Sneer. Sir Peter, you are not going to leave us?

Sir Pet. Your ladyship must excuse me; I'm called away by particular business. But I leave
my character behind me.      [Exit.

Sir Ben. Well--certainly, Lady Teazle, that lord of yours is a strange being: I could tell
you some stories of him would make you laugh heartily if he were not your husband.

Lady Teaz. Oh, pray, don't mind that; come, do let's hear them.      [Exeunt all but JOSEPH
SURFACE and MARIA.

Jos. Surf. Maria, I see you have no satisfaction in this society.

Mar. How is it possible I should? If to raise malicious smiles at the infirmities or misfortunes
of those who have never injured us be the province of wit or humor, Heaven grant me a double
portion of dulness!

Jos. Surf. Yet they appear more ill-natured than they are; they have no malice at heart.

Mar. Then is their conduct still more contemptible; for, in my opinion, nothing could excuse
the intemperance of their tongues but a natural and uncontrollable bitterness of mind.

FOOTNOTES:

[G] For the sake of brevity a part of the first scene has been excised. It subsequently appears
that Lady Teazle abandons the society of the scandal-mongers, and she and her fond but somewhat
irascible husband become happily reconciled.

XXVIII. THE COTTER'S SATURDAY NIGHT.[H]

ROBERT BURNS.--1759-1796.

    Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
      Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
    Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
      The short and simple annals of the poor.

        GRAY.

    My lov'd, my honor'd, much respected friend!
      No mercenary bard his homage pays;
    With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end,--
      My dearest meed, a friend's esteem and praise:
      To you I sing, in simple Scottish lays,
    The lowly train in life's sequester'd scene;
      The native feelings strong, the guileless ways;
    What Aiken in a cottage would have been;
    Ah! though his worth unknown, far happier there, I ween.

    November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh;[1]
      The short'ning winter-day is near a close;
    The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh;
      The black'ning trains o' craws to their repose:
      The toil-worn Cotter frae his labor goes--
    This night his weekly moil is at an end,--
      Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes,
    Hoping the morn[2] in ease and rest to spend,
    And, weary, o'er the moor, his course does hameward bend.

    At length his lonely cot appears in view,
      Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;
    The expectant wee-things, toddlin, stacher[3] through,
      To meet their dad, wi' flichterin[4] noise an' glee.
      His wee bit ingle,[5] blinkin bonnily,
    His clean hearth-stane, his thriftie wifie's smile,
      The lisping infant prattling on his knee,
    Does a' his weary carking cares beguile,
      An' makes him quite forget his labor an' his toil.

    Belyve,[6] the elder bairns come drapping in,
      At service out, amang the farmers roun';
    Some ca'[7] the pleugh, some herd, some tentie[8] rin
      A canny[9] errand to a neebor town:
      Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman grown,
    In youthfu' bloom, love sparkling in her e'e,
      Comes hame, perhaps, to show a braw[10] new gown,
    Or deposite[11] her sair-won[12] penny-fee,[13]
    To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be.

    Wi' joy unfeign'd, brothers and sisters meet
      And each for other's welfare kindly spiers:[14]
    The social hours, swift-wing'd, unnoticed fleet;
      Each tells the uncos[15] that he sees or hears;
      The parents, partial, eye their hopeful years;
    Anticipation forward points the view.
      The mother, wi' her needle an' her shears,
    Gars[16] auld claes look amaist as weel's the new;
    The father mixes a' wi' admonition due.

    Their master's an' their mistress's command
      The younkers a' are warnèd to obey;
    An' mind their labors wi' an eydent[17] hand,
      An' ne'er, though out o' sight, to jauk[18] or play:
      "An' oh! be sure to fear the Lord alway,
    An' mind your duty, duly, morn an' night!
      Lest in temptation's path ye gang astray,
    Implore His counsel and assisting might:
    They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright!"

    But, hark! a rap comes gently to the door;
      Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same,
    Tells how a neebor lad cam o'er the moor
      To do some errands, and convoy her hame.
      The wily mother sees the conscious flame
    Sparkle in Jenny's e'e, an' flush her cheek;
      Wi' heart-struck, anxious care, inquires his name,
    While Jenny hafflins[19] is afraid to speak;
    Weel pleas'd the mother hears it's nae wild, worthless rake.

    Wi' kindly welcome Jenny brings him ben;[20]
      A strappan youth; he taks the mother's eye;
    Blithe Jenny sees the visit's no ill ta'en;
      The father cracks[21] of horses, pleughs, and kye.
      The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy,
    But, blate[22] an' laithfu',[23] scarce can weel behave;
      The mother, wi' a woman's wiles, can spy
    What makes the youth sae bashfu' an' sae grave;
    Weel pleas'd to think her bairn's respected like the lave.[24]

    O happy love! where love like this is found!
      O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare!
    I've pacèd much this weary, mortal round,
      And sage experience bids me this declare--
      "If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare,
    One cordial in this melancholy vale,
      'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair,
    In other's arms breathe out the tender tale,
    Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening gale."

    Is there, in human form, that bears a heart--
      A wretch! a villain! lost to love and truth!
    That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art,
      Betray sweet Jenny's unsuspecting youth?
      Curse on his perjur'd arts! dissembling smooth!
    Are honor, virtue, conscience, all exil'd?
      Is there no pity, no relenting ruth,
    Points to the parents fondling o'er their child?
    Then paints the ruin'd maid, and their distraction wild!

    But now the supper crowns their simple board,
      The halesome parritch, chief of Scotia's food
    The soupe[25] their only hawkie[26] does afford,
      That 'yont the hallan[27] snugly chows her cood;
      The dame brings forth, in complimental mood,
    To grace the lad, her weel-hain'd[28] kebbuck,[29] fell,[30]
      An' aft he's prest, an' aft he ca's it guid:
    The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell
    How 'twas a towmond[31] auld, sin' lint was i' the bell.[32]

    The cheerfu' supper done, wi' serious face,
      They, round the ingle, form a circle wide;
    The sire turns o'er, wi' patriarchal grace,
      The big ha'-Bible,[33] ance his father's pride:
      His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside,
    His lyart[34] haffets[35] wearing thin an' bare;
      Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide,
    He wales[36] a portion with judicious care;
    And "Let us worship God!" he says, with solemn air.

    They chant their artless notes in simple guise;
      They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim:
    Perhaps "Dundee's" wild warbling measures rise,
      Or plaintive "Martyrs," worthy of the name;
      Or noble "Elgin" beets[37] the heavenward flame,
    The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays:
      Compar'd with these, Italian trills are tame;
    The tickled ears no heart-felt raptures raise;
    Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.

    The priest-like father reads the sacred page--
      How Abram was the friend of God on high;
    Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage
      With Amalek's ungracious progeny;
      Or how the royal bard did groaning lie
    Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire;
      Or Job's pathetic plaint, and wailing cry;
    Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire;
    Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.

    Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme--
      How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;
    How He, who bore in Heaven the second name,
      Had not on earth whereon to lay His head;
      How His first followers and servants sped;
    The precepts sage they wrote to many a land;
      How he, who lone in Patmos banishèd,
    Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand;
    And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounced by Heaven's command.

    Then kneeling down, to Heaven's Eternal King,
      The saint, the father, and the husband prays:
    Hope "springs exulting on triumphant wing,"
      That thus they all shall meet in future days:
      There ever bask in uncreated rays,
    No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear;
      Together hymning their Creator's praise,
    In such society, yet still more dear;
    While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere.

    Compar'd with this, how poor Religion's pride,
      In all the pomp of method, and of art,
    When men display to congregations wide
      Devotion's every grace, except the heart!
      The Power, incens'd, the pageant will desert,
    The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole;
      But, haply, in some cottage far apart,
    May hear, well pleas'd, the language of the soul;
    And in His book of life the inmates poor enroll.

    Then homeward all take off their several way:
      The youngling cottagers retire to rest;
    The parent-pair their secret homage pay,
      And proffer up to Heaven the warm request
      That He, who stills the raven's clam'rous nest,
    And decks the lily fair in flowery pride,
      Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best,
    For them, and for their little ones provide;
    But chiefly, in their hearts with grace divine preside.

    From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs,
      That makes her lov'd at home, rever'd abroad:
    Princes and lords are but the breath of kings;
      "An honest man's the noblest work of God;"
      And certes, in fair virtue's heavenly road,
    The cottage leaves the palace far behind;
      What is a lordling's pomp?--a cumbrous load,
    Disguising oft the wretch of human kind,
    Studied in arts of hell, in wickedness refin'd!

    O Scotia! my dear, my native soil!
      For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent!
    Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil
      Be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content!
      And, oh! may Heaven their simple lives prevent
    From luxury's contagion, weak and vile!
      Then, howe'er crowns and coronets be rent,
    A virtuous populace may rise the while,
    And stand a wall of fire around their much-lov'd Isle.

XXIX. THE LAND O' THE LEAL.

LADY NAIRN.--1766-1845.

    I'm wearin' awa', John,
    Like snaw-wreaths in thaw, John,
    I'm wearin' awa'
      To the land o' the leal.
    There's nae sorrow there, John;
    There's neither cauld nor care, John;
    The day is aye fair
      In the land o' the leal.

    Our bonnie bairn's there, John;
    She was baith gude and fair, John;
    And oh! we grudg'd her sair
      To the land o' the leal.
    But sorrow's sel' wears past, John,
    And joy's a-comin' fast, John,
    The joy that's aye to last
      In the land o' the leal.

    Sae dear that joy was bought, John,
    Sae free the battle fought, John,
    That sinfu' man e'er brought
      To the land o' the leal.
    Oh! dry your glistening e'e, John,
    My soul langs to be free, John,
    And angels beckon me
      To the land o' the leal.

    Oh! haud ye leal and true, John,
    Your day it's wearin' through, John,
    And I'll welcome you
      To the land o' the leal.
    Now fare-ye weel, my ain John,
    This warld's cares are vain, John,
    We'll meet, and we'll be fain
      In the land o' the leal.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Life! we've been long together,
    Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;
      'Tis hard to part when friends are dear;
      Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear;
      Then steal away, give little warning,
        Choose thine own time;
    Say not Good-night, but in some brighter clime
        Bid me Good-morning.

         MRS. BARBAULD.--1743-1825.

XXX. THE TRIAL BY COMBAT AT THE DIAMOND OF THE DESERT.[I]

From THE TALISMAN.

SIR WALTER SCOTT.--1771-1832.

It had been agreed, on account of the heat of the climate, that the judicial combat, which
was the cause of the present assemblage of various nations at the Diamond of the Desert, should
take place at one hour after sunrise. The wide lists, which had been constructed under the
inspection of the Knight of the Leopard, enclosed a space of hard sand, which was one hundred
and twenty yards long by forty in width. They extended in length from north to south, so as
to give both parties the equal advantage of the rising sun. Saladin's royal seat was erected
on the western side of the enclosure, just in the centre, where the combatants were expected
to meet in mid encounter. Opposed to this was a gallery with closed casements, so contrived,
that the ladies, for whose accommodation it was erected, might see the fight without being
themselves exposed to view. At either extremity of the lists was a barrier, which could be
opened or shut at pleasure. Thrones had been also erected, but the Archduke, perceiving that
his was lower than King Richard's, refused to occupy it; and Coeur de Lion, who would have
submitted to much ere any formality should have interfered with the combat, readily agreed
that the sponsors, as they were called, should remain on horseback during the fight. At one
extremity of the lists were placed the followers of Richard, and opposed to them were those
who accompanied the defender, Conrade. Around the throne destined for the Soldan were ranged
his splendid Georgian Guards, and the rest of the enclosure was occupied by Christian and Mohammedan
spectators.

Long before daybreak, the lists were surrounded by even a larger number of Saracens than Richard
had seen on the preceding evening. When the first ray of the sun's glorious orb arose above
the desert, the sonorous call, "To prayer, to prayer!" was poured forth by the Soldan himself,
and answered by others, whose rank and zeal entitled them to act as muezzins. It was a striking
spectacle to see them all sink to earth, for the purpose of repeating their devotions, with
their faces turned to Mecca. But when they arose from the ground, the sun's rays, now strengthening
fast, seemed to confirm the Lord of Gilsland's conjecture of the night before. They were flashed
back from many a spear-head, for the pointless lances of the preceding day were certainly no
longer such. De Vaux pointed it out to his master, who answered with impatience, that he had
perfect confidence in the good faith of the Soldan; but if De Vaux was afraid of his bulky
body, he might retire.

Soon after this the noise of timbrels was heard, at the sound of which the whole Saracen cavaliers
threw themselves from their horses, and prostrated themselves, as if for a second morning prayer.
This was to give an opportunity to the Queen, with Edith and her attendants, to pass from the
pavilion to the gallery intended for them. Fifty guards of Saladin's seraglio escorted them,
with naked sabres, whose orders were, to cut to pieces whomsoever, were he prince or peasant,
should venture to gaze on the ladies as they passed, or even presume to raise his head until
the cessation of the music should make all men aware that they were lodged in their gallery,
not to be gazed on by the curious eye.

This superstitious observance of Oriental reverence to the fair sex called forth from Queen
Berengaria some criticisms very unfavorable to Saladin and his country. But their den, as the
royal fair called it, being securely closed and guarded by their sable attendants, she was
under the necessity of contenting herself with seeing, and laying aside for the present the
still more exquisite pleasure of being seen.

Meantime the sponsors of both champions went, as was their duty, to see that they were duly
armed, and prepared for combat. The Archduke of Austria was in no hurry to perform this part
of the ceremony, having had rather an unusually severe debauch upon wine of Schiraz the preceding
evening. But the Grand Master of the Temple, more deeply concerned in the event of the combat,
was early before the tent of Conrade of Montserrat. To his great surprise, the attendants refused
him admittance.

"Do you not know me, ye knaves?" said the Grand Master in great anger.

"We do, most valiant and reverend," answered Conrade's squire; "but even you may not at present
enter--the Marquis is about to confess himself."

"Confess himself!" exclaimed the Templar, in a tone where alarm mingled with surprise and scorn--"and
to whom I pray thee?"

"My master bid me be secret," said the squire; on which the Grand Master pushed past him, and
entered the tent almost by force.

The Marquis of Montserrat was kneeling at the feet of the Hermit of Engaddi, and in the act
of beginning his confession.

"What means this, Marquis?" said the Grand Master, "up, for shame--or, if you must needs confess,
am not I here?"

"I have confessed to you too often already," replied Conrade, with a pale cheek and a faltering
voice. "For God's sake, Grand Master, begone, and let me unfold my conscience to this holy man."

"In what is he holier than I am?" said the Grand Master.--"Hermit, prophet, madman--say, if
thou darest, in what thou excellest me?"

"Bold and bad man," replied the Hermit, "know that I am like the latticed window, and the divine
light passes through to avail others, though alas! it helpeth not me. Thou art like the iron
stanchions, which neither receive light themselves, nor communicate it to any one."

"Prate not to me, but depart from this tent," said the Grand Master; "the Marquis shall not
confess this morning, unless it be to me, for I part not from his side."

"Is this your pleasure?" said the Hermit to Conrade; "for think not I will obey that proud
man, if you continue to desire my assistance."

"Alas!" said Conrade irresolutely, "what would you have me say? Farewell for a while--we will
speak anon."

"O, procrastination!" exclaimed the Hermit, "thou art a soul-murderer!--Unhappy man, farewell;
not for a while, but until we both shall meet--no matter where.--And for thee," he added, turning
to the Grand Master, "TREMBLE!"

"Tremble!" replied the Templar contemptuously, "I cannot if I would."

The Hermit heard not his answer, having left the tent.

"Come! to this gear hastily," said the Grand Master, "since thou wilt needs go through the
foolery.--Hark thee--I think I know most of thy frailties by heart, so we may omit the detail,
which may be somewhat a long one, and begin with the absolution. What signifies counting the
spots of dirt that we are about to wash from our hands?"

"Knowing what thou art thyself," said Conrade, "it is blasphemous to speak of pardoning another."

"That is not according to the canon, Lord Marquis," said the Templar; "thou art more scrupulous
than orthodox. The absolution of the wicked priest is as effectual as if he were himself a
saint; otherwise,--God help the poor penitent! What wounded man inquires whether the surgeon
that tents his gashes have clean hands or not?--Come, shall we to this toy?"

"No," said Conrade, "I will rather die unconfessed than mock the sacrament."

"Come, noble Marquis," said the Templar, "rouse up your courage, and speak not thus. In an
hour's time thou shalt stand victorious in the lists, or confess thee in thy helmet, like a
valiant knight."

"Alas, Grand Master!" answered Conrade, "all augurs ill for this affair. The strange discovery
by the instinct of a dog, the revival of this Scottish knight, who comes into the lists like
a spectre,--all betokens evil."

"Pshaw!" said the Templar, "I have seen thee bend thy lance boldly against him in sport, and
with equal chance of success. Think thou art but in a tournament, and who bears him better
in the tilt-yard than thou?--Come, squires and armorers, your master must be accoutred for
the field."

The attendants entered accordingly, and began to arm the Marquis.

"What morning is without?" said Conrade.

"The sun rises dimly," answered a squire.

"Thou seest, Grand Master," said Conrade, "naught smiles on us."

"Thou wilt fight the more coolly, my son," answered the Templar. "Thank Heaven that hath tempered
the sun of Palestine to suit thine occasion."

Thus jested the Grand Master; but his jests had lost their influence on the harassed mind of
the Marquis, and, notwithstanding his attempts to seem gay, his gloom communicated itself to
the Templar.

"This craven," he thought, "will lose the day in pure faintness and cowardice of heart, which
he calls tender conscience. I, whom visions and auguries shake not--who am firm in my purpose
as the living rock--I should have fought the combat myself.--Would to God the Scot may strike
him dead on the spot; it were next best to his winning the victory. But, come what will, he
must have no other confessor than myself. Our sins are too much in common, and he might confess
my share with his own."

While these thoughts passed through his mind, he continued to assist the Marquis in arming,
but it was in silence.

The hour at length arrived, the trumpets sounded, the knights rode into the lists armed at
all points, and mounted like men who were to do battle for a kingdom's honor. They wore their
visors up, and, riding around the lists three times, showed themselves to the spectators. Both
were goodly persons, and both had noble countenances. But there was an air of manly confidence
on the brow of the Scot, a radiancy of hope, which amounted even to cheerfulness, while, although
pride and effort had recalled much of Conrade's natural courage, there lowered still on his
brow a cloud of ominous despondence. Even his steed seemed to tread less lightly and blithely
to the trumpet-sound than the noble Arab which was bestrode by Sir Kenneth; and the spruch-sprecher
shook his head while he observed, that while the challenger rode around the lists in the course
of the sun--that is, from right to left--the defender made the same circuit widder-sins--that
is, from left to right--which is in most countries held ominous.

A temporary altar was erected just beneath the gallery occupied by the Queen, and beside it
stood the Hermit in the dress of his order, as a Carmelite friar. Other churchmen were also
present. To this altar the challenger and defender were successively brought forward, conducted
by their respective sponsors. Dismounting before it, each knight avouched the justice of his
cause by a solemn oath on the Evangelists, and prayed that his success might be according to
the truth or falsehood of what he then swore. They also made oath, that they came to do battle
in knightly guise, and with the usual weapons, disclaiming the use of spells, charms, or magical
devices, to incline victory to their side. The challenger pronounced his vow with a firm and
manly voice, and a bold and cheerful countenance. When the ceremony was finished, the Scottish
Knight looked at the gallery, and bent his head to the earth, as if in honor of those invisible
beauties which were enclosed within; then, loaded with armor as he was, sprung to the saddle
without the use of the stirrup, and made his courser carry him in a succession of caracoles
to his station at the eastern extremity of the lists. Conrade also presented himself before
the altar with boldness enough; but his voice, as he took the oath, sounded hollow, as if drowned
in his helmet. The lips with which he appealed to Heaven to adjudge victory to the just quarrel,
grew white as they uttered the impious mockery. As he turned to remount his horse, the Grand
Master approached him closer, as if to rectify something about the sitting of his gorget, and
whispered, "Coward and fool! recall thy senses, and do me this battle bravely; else, by Heaven,
shouldst thou escape him, thou escapest not me!"

The savage tone in which this was whispered, perhaps completed the confusion of the Marquis's
nerves, for he stumbled as he made to horse; and though he recovered his feet, sprung to the
saddle with his usual agility, and displayed his address in horsemanship as he assumed his
position opposite to the challenger's, yet the accident did not escape those who were on the
watch for omens, which might predict the fate of the day.

The priests, after a solemn prayer that God would show the rightful quarrel, departed from
the lists. The trumpets of the challenger then rung a flourish, and the herald-at-arms proclaimed
at the eastern end of the lists,--"Here stands a good knight, Sir Kenneth of Scotland, champion
for the royal King Richard of England, who accuseth Conrade, Marquis of Montserrat, of foul
treason and dishonor done to the said King."

When the words Kenneth of Scotland announced the name and character of the champion, hitherto
scarce generally known, a loud and cheerful acclaim burst from the followers of King Richard,
and hardly, notwithstanding repeated commands of silence, suffered the reply of the defendant
to be heard. He, of course, avouched his innocence, and offered his body for battle. The esquires
of the combatants now approached, and delivered to each his shield and lance, assisting to
hang the former around his neck, that his two hands might remain free, one for the management
of the bridle, the other to direct the lance.

The shield of the Scot displayed his old bearing, the leopard, but with the addition of a collar
and broken chain, in allusion to his late captivity. The shield of the Marquis bore, in reference
to his title, a serrated and rocky mountain. Each shook his lance aloft, as if to ascertain
the weight and toughness of the unwieldy weapon, and then laid it in the rest. The sponsors,
heralds, and squires, now retired to the barriers, and the combatants sat opposite to each
other, face to face, with couched lance and closed visor, the human form so completely enclosed,
that they looked more like statues of molten iron than beings of flesh and blood. The silence
of suspense was now general--men breathed thicker, and their very souls seemed seated in their
eyes, while not a sound was to be heard save the snorting and pawing of the good steeds, who,
sensible of what was about to happen, were impatient to dash into career. They stood thus for
perhaps three minutes, when at a signal given by the Soldan, an hundred instruments rent the
air with their brazen clamors, and each champion striking his horse with the spurs, and slacking
the rein, the horses started into full gallop, and the knights met in mid space with a shock
like a thunderbolt. The victory was not in doubt--no, not one moment. Conrade, indeed, showed
himself a practised warrior; for he struck his antagonist knightly in the midst of his shield,
bearing his lance so straight and true, that it shivered into splinters from the steel spear-head
up to the very gauntlet. The horse of Sir Kenneth recoiled two or three yards and fell on his
haunches, but the rider easily raised him with hand and rein. But for Conrade there was no
recovery. Sir Kenneth's lance had pierced through the shield, through a plated corselet of
Milan steel, through a secret, or coat of linked mail, worn beneath the corselet, had wounded
him deep in the bosom, and borne him from his saddle, leaving the truncheon of the lance fixed
in his wound. The sponsors, heralds, and Saladin himself, descending from his throne, crowded
around the wounded man; while Sir Kenneth, who had drawn his sword ere yet he discovered his
antagonist was totally helpless, now commanded him to avow his guilt. The helmet was hastily
unclosed, and the wounded man, gazing wildly on the skies, replied, "What would you more? God
hath decided justly. I am guilty--but there are worse traitors in the camp than I.--In pity
to my soul, let me have a confessor!"

He revived as he uttered these words.

"The talisman--the powerful remedy, royal brother," said King Richard to Saladin.

"The traitor," answered the Soldan, "is more fit to be dragged from the lists to the gallows
by the heels, than to profit by its virtues: and some such fate is in his look," he added,
after gazing fixedly upon the wounded man; "for though his wound may be cured, yet Azrael's
seal is on the wretch's brow."

"Nevertheless," said Richard, "I pray you do for him what you may, that he may at least have
time for confession. Slay not soul and body! To him one half-hour of time may be worth more,
by ten thousand fold, than the life of the oldest patriarch."

"My royal brother's wish shall be obeyed," said Saladin.--"Slaves, bear this wounded man to
our tent."

"Do not so," said the Templar, who had hitherto stood gloomily looking on in silence. "The
royal Duke of Austria and myself will not permit this unhappy Christian prince to be delivered
over to the Saracens, that they may try their spells upon him. We are his sponsors, and demand
that he be assigned to our care."

"That is, you refuse the certain means offered to recover him?" said Richard.

"Not so," said the Grand Master, recollecting himself. "If the Soldan useth lawful medicines,
he may attend the patient in my tent."

"Do so, I pray thee, good brother," said Richard to Saladin, "though the permission be ungraciously
yielded.--But now to a more glorious work. Sound, trumpets--shout, England, in honor of England's
champion!"

Drum, clarion, trumpet, and cymbal, rung forth at once, and the deep and regular shout, which
for ages has been the English acclamation, sounded amidst the shrill and irregular yells of
the Arabs, like the diapason of the organ amid the howling of a storm. There was silence at length.

"Brave Knight of the Leopard," resumed Coeur de Lion, "thou hast shown that the Ethiopian may
change his skin and the Leopard his spots, though clerks quote Scripture for the impossibility.
Yet I have more to say to you when I have conducted you to the presence of the ladies, the
best judges, and best rewarders, of deeds of chivalry."

The Knight of the Leopard bowed assent.

"And thou, princely Saladin, wilt also attend them. I promise thee our Queen will not think
herself welcome, if she lacks the opportunity to thank her royal host for her most princely
reception."

Saladin bent his head gracefully, but declined the invitation.

"I must attend the wounded man," he said. "The leech leaves not his patient more than the champion
the lists, even if he be summoned to a bower like those of Paradise.... At noon," said the
Soldan, as he departed, "I trust ye will all accept a collation under the black camel-skin
tent of a chief of Curdistan."

The same invitation was circulated among the Christians, comprehending all those of sufficient
importance to be admitted to sit at a feast made for princes.

"Hark!" said Richard, "the timbrels announce that our Queen and her attendants are leaving
their gallery; and see, the turbans sink on the ground, as if struck down by a destroying angel.
All lie prostrate, as if the glance of an Arab's eye could sully the lustre of a lady's cheek!
Come, we will to the pavillion, and lead our conqueror thither in triumph. How I pity that
noble Soldan, who knows but of love as it is known to those of inferior nature!"

Blondel tuned his harp to its boldest measure, to welcome the introduction of the victor into
the pavilion of Queen Berengaria. He entered, supported on either side by his sponsors, Richard
and William Longsword, and knelt gracefully down before the Queen, though more than half the
homage was silently rendered to Edith, who sat on her right hand.

"Unarm him, my mistresses," said the King, whose delight was in the execution of such chivalrous
usages; "let Beauty honor Chivalry! Undo his spurs, Berengaria; Queen though thou be, thou
owest him what marks of favor thou canst give.--Unlace his helmet, Edith; by this hand, thou
shalt, wert thou the proudest Plantagenet of the line, and he the poorest knight on earth!"

Both ladies obeyed the royal commands,--Berengaria with bustling assiduity, as anxious to gratify
her husband's humor, and Edith blushing and growing pale alternately, as slowly and awkwardly
she undid, with Longsword's assistance, the fastenings which secured the helmet to the gorget.

"And what expect you from beneath this iron shell?" said Richard, as the removal of the casque
gave to view the noble countenance of Sir Kenneth, his face glowing with recent exertion, and
not less so with present emotion. "What think ye of him, gallants and beauties?" said Richard.
"Doth he resemble an Ethiopian slave, or doth he present the face of an obscure and nameless
adventurer? No, by my good sword! Here terminate his various disguises. He hath knelt down
before you, unknown save by his worth; he arises, equally distinguished by birth and by fortune.
The adventurous knight, Kenneth, arises David, Earl of Huntingdon, Prince Royal of Scotland!"

There was a general exclamation of surprise, and Edith dropped from her hand the helmet which
she had just received....

"May we know of your grace by what strange and happy chance this riddle has been read?" said
the Queen Berengaria.

"Letters were brought to us from England," said the King, "in which we learned, among other
unpleasant news, that the King of Scotland had seized upon three of our nobles, when on a pilgrimage
to Saint Ninian, and alleged as a cause, that his heir being supposed to be fighting in the
ranks of the Teutonic Knights, against the heathen of Borussia, was, in fact, in our camp and
in our power; and, therefore, William proposed to hold these nobles as hostages for his safety.
This gave me the first light on the real rank of the Knight of the Leopard, and my suspicions
were confirmed by De Vaux, who, on his return from Ascalon, brought back with him the Earl
of Huntingdon's sole attendant, a thick-skulled slave, who had gone thirty miles to unfold
to De Vaux a secret he should have told to me."

"Old Strauchan must be excused," said the Lord of Gilsland. "He knew from experience that my
heart is somewhat softer than if I wrote myself Plantagenet."

"Thy heart soft? thou commodity of old iron, and Cumberland flint that thou art!" exclaimed
the King. "It is we Plantagenets who boast soft and feeling hearts, Edith," he continued, turning
to his cousin, with an expression which called the blood into her cheek.--"Give me thy hand,
my fair cousin, and, Prince of Scotland, thine."...

It is needless to follow into further particulars the conferences at the royal tent, or to
enquire whether David, Earl of Huntingdon, was as mute in the presence of Edith Plantagenet,
as when he was bound to act under the character of an obscure and nameless adventurer. It may
be well believed that he there expressed, with suitable earnestness, the passion to which he
had so often before found it difficult to give words.

The hour of noon now approached, and Saladin waited to receive the Princes of Christendom in
a tent, which, but for its large size, differed little from that of the ordinary shelter of
the common Curdman, or Arab; yet, beneath its ample and sable covering, was prepared a banquet
after the most gorgeous fashion of the East, extended upon carpets of the richest stuffs, with
cushions laid for the guests. But we cannot stop to describe the cloth of gold and silver,
the superb embroidery in Arabesque, the shawls of Cashmere, and the muslins of India, which
were here unfolded in all their splendor; far less to tell the different sweetmeats, ragouts
edged with rice colored in various manners, with all the other niceties of Eastern cookery.
Lambs roasted whole, and game and poultry dressed in pilaus, were piled in vessels of gold,
and silver, and porcelain, and intermixed with large mazers of sherbet, cooled in snow and
ice from the caverns of Mount Lebanon. A magnificent pile of cushions at the head of the banquet,
seemed prepared for the master of the feast, and such dignitaries as he might call to share
that place of distinction, while from the roof of the tent in all quarters, but over this seat
of eminence in particular, waved many a banner and pennon, the trophies of battles won, and
kingdoms overthrown. But amongst and above them all, a long lance displayed a shroud, the banner
of Death, with this impressive inscription, "SALADIN, KING OF KINGS--SALADIN, VICTOR OF VICTORS--SALADIN
MUST DIE." Amid these preparations, the slaves who had arranged the refreshments stood with
drooped heads and folded arms, mute and motionless as monumental statuary, or as automata,
which waited the touch of the artist to put them in motion.

Expecting the approach of his princely guests, the Soldan, imbued, as most were, with the superstitions
of his time, paused over a horoscope and corresponding scroll, which had been sent to him by
the Hermit of Engaddi when he departed from the camp.

"Strange and mysterious science," he muttered to himself, "which, pretending to draw the curtain
of futurity, misleads those whom it seems to guide, and darkens the scene which it pretends
to illuminate! Who would not have said that I was that enemy most dangerous to Richard, whose
enmity was to be ended by marriage with his kinswoman? Yet it now appears that a union betwixt
this gallant Earl and the lady will bring about friendship betwixt Richard and Scotland, an
enemy more dangerous than I, as a wild cat in a chamber is more to be dreaded than a lion in
a distant desert.--But then,...--How now, what means this intrusion?"

He spoke to the dwarf Nectabanus, who rushed into the tent fearfully agitated, with each strange
and disproportioned feature wrenched by horror into still more extravagant ugliness,--his mouth
open, his eyes staring, his hands, with their shrivelled and deformed fingers, wildly expanded.

"What now?" said the Soldan, sternly.

"Accipe hoc!" groaned out the dwarf.

"Ha! say'st thou?" answered Saladin.

"Accipe hoc!" replied the panic-struck creature, unconscious, perhaps, that he repeated the
same words as before.

"Hence! I am in no vein for foolery," said the Emperor.

"Nor am I further fool," said the dwarf, "than to make my folly help out my wits to earn my
bread, poor helpless wretch!--Hear, hear me, great Soldan!"

"Nay, if thou hast actual wrong to complain of," said Saladin, "fool or wise, thou art entitled
to the ear of a King.--Retire hither with me;" and he led him into the inner tent.

Whatever their conference related to, it was soon broken off by the fanfare of the trumpets,
announcing the arrival of the various Christian princes, whom Saladin welcomed to his tent
with a royal courtesy well becoming their rank and his own; but chiefly he saluted the young
Earl of Huntingdon, and generously congratulated him upon prospects, which seemed to have interfered
with and overclouded those which he had himself entertained.

"But think not," said the Soldan, "thou noble youth, that the Prince of Scotland is more welcome
to Saladin, than was Kenneth to the solitary Ilderim when they met in the desert, or the distressed
Ethiop to the Hakim Adonbec. A brave and generous disposition like thine hath a value independent
of condition and birth, as the cool draught which I here proffer thee, is as delicious from
an earthen vessel as from a goblet of gold."

The Earl of Huntingdon made a suitable reply, gratefully acknowledging the various important
services he had received from the generous Soldan; but when he had pledged Saladin in the bowl
of sherbet which the Soldan had proffered to him, he could not help remarking with a smile,
"The brave cavalier, Ilderim, knew not of the formation of ice, but the munificent Soldan cools
his sherbet with snow."

"Wouldst thou have an Arab or a Curdman as wise as a Hakim?" said the Soldan. "He who does
on a disguise must make the sentiments of his heart and the learning of his head accord with
the dress which he assumes. I desired to see how a brave and single-hearted cavalier of Frangistan
would conduct himself in debate with such a chief as I then seemed; and I questioned the truth
of a well-known fact, to know by what arguments thou wouldst support thy assertion."

While they were speaking, the Archduke of Austria, who stood a little apart, was struck with
the mention of iced sherbet, and took with pleasure and some bluntness the deep goblet, as
the Earl of Huntingdon was about to replace it.

"Most delicious!" he exclaimed, after a deep draught, which the heat of the weather, and the
feverishness following the debauch of the preceding day, had rendered doubly acceptable. He
sighed as he handed the cup to the Grand Master of the Templars. Saladin made a sign to the
dwarf, who advanced and pronounced, with a harsh voice, the words, Accipe hoc! The Templar
started, like a steed who sees a lion under a bush, beside the pathway; yet instantly recovered,
and to hide, perhaps, his confusion, raised the goblet to his lips;--but those lips never touched
that goblet's rim. The sabre of Saladin left its sheath as lightning leaves the cloud. It was
waved in the air,--and the head of the Grand Master rolled to the extremity of the tent, while
the trunk remained, for a second, standing, with the goblet still clenched in its grasp, then
fell, the liquor mingling with the blood that spurted from the veins.

There was a general exclamation of treason, and Austria, nearest to whom Saladin stood with
the bloody sabre in his hand, started back as if apprehensive that his turn was to come next.
Richard and others laid hand on their swords.

"Fear nothing, noble Austria," said Saladin, as composedly as if nothing had happened, "nor
you, royal England, be wroth at what you have seen. Not for his manifold treasons;--not for
the attempt which, as may be vouched by his own squire, he instigated against King Richard's
life;--not that he pursued the Prince of Scotland and myself in the desert, reducing us to
save our lives by the speed of our horses;--not that he had stirred up the Maronites to attack
us upon this very occasion, had I not brought up unexpectedly so many Arabs as rendered the
scheme abortive;--not for any or all of these crimes does he now lie there, although each were
deserving such a doom;--but because, scarce half-an-hour ere he polluted our presence, as the
simoom empoisons the atmosphere, he poniarded his comrade and accomplice, Conrade of Montserrat,
lest he should confess the infamous plots in which they had both been engaged."

"How! Conrade murdered?--And by the Grand Master, his sponsor and most intimate friend!" exclaimed
Richard. "Noble Soldan, I would not doubt thee; yet this must be proved; otherwise"----

"There stands the evidence," said Saladin, pointing to the terrified dwarf. "Allah, who sends
the fire-fly to illuminate the night-season, can discover secret crimes by the most contemptible
means."

The Soldan proceeded to tell the dwarf's story, which amounted to this.--In his foolish curiosity,
or as he partly confessed, with some thoughts of pilfering, Nectabanus had strayed into the
tent of Conrade, which had been deserted by his attendants, some of whom had left the encampment
to carry the news of his defeat to his brother, and others were availing themselves of the
means which Saladin had supplied for revelling. The wounded man slept under the influence of
Saladin's wonderful talisman, so that the dwarf had opportunity to pry about at pleasure, until
he was frightened into concealment by the sound of a heavy step. He skulked behind a curtain,
yet could see the motions, and hear the words of the Grand Master, who entered, and carefully
secured the covering of the pavillion behind him. His victim started from sleep, and it would
appear that he instantly suspected the purpose of his old associate, for it was in a tone of
alarm that he demanded wherefore he disturbed him.

"I come to confess and absolve thee," answered the Grand Master.

Of their further speech the terrified dwarf remembered little, save that Conrade implored the
Grand Master not to break a wounded reed, and that the Templar struck him to the heart with
a Turkish dagger, with the words Accipe hoc,--words which long afterward haunted the terrified
imagination of the concealed witness.

"I verified the tale," said Saladin, "by causing the body to be examined; and I made this unhappy
being, whom Allah hath made the discoverer of the crime, repeat in your own presence the words
which the murderer spoke, and you yourselves saw the effect which they produced upon his conscience."

The Soldan paused, and the King of England broke silence:--

"If this be true, as I doubt not, we have witnessed a great act of justice, though it bore
a different aspect. But wherefore in this presence? wherefore with thine own hand?"

"I had designed otherwise," said Saladin, "but had I not hastened his doom, it had been altogether
averted, since, if I had permitted him to taste of my cup, as he was about to do, how could
I, without incurring the brand of inhospitality, have done him to death as he deserved? Had
he murdered my father, and afterward partaken of my food and my bowl, not a hair of his head
could have been injured by me. But enough of him; let his carcass and his memory be removed
from amongst us."

The body was carried away, and the marks of the slaughter obliterated or concealed with such
ready dexterity, as showed that the case was not altogether so uncommon, as to paralyze the
assistants and officers of Saladin's household.

But the Christian princes felt that the scene which they had beheld weighed heavily on their
spirits, and although, at the courteous invitation of the Soldan, they assumed their seats
at the banquet, yet it was with the silence of doubt and amazement. The spirits of Richard
alone surmounted all cause for suspicion or embarrassment. Yet he, too, seemed to ruminate
on some proposition, as if he were desirous of making it in the most insinuating and acceptable
manner which was possible. At length he drank off a large bowl of wine, and addressing the
Soldan, desired to know whether it was not true that he had honored the Earl of Huntingdon
with a personal encounter.

Saladin answered with a smile, that he had proved his horse and his weapons with the heir of
Scotland, as cavaliers are wont to do with each other when they meet in the desert; and modestly
added that, though the combat was not entirely decisive, he had not, on his part, much reason
to pride himself on the event. The Scot, on the other hand, disclaimed the attributed superiority,
and wished to assign it to the Soldan.

"Enough of honor thou hast had in the encounter," said Richard, "and I envy thee more for that,
than for the smiles of Edith Plantagenet, though one of them might reward a bloody day's work.--But
what say you, noble princes; is it fitting that such a royal ring of chivalry should break
up without something being done for future times to speak of? What is the overthrow and death
of a traitor, to such a fair garland of honor as is here assembled, and which ought not to
part without witnessing something more worthy of their regard? How say you, princely Soldan;
what if we two should now, and before this fair company, decide the long-contended question
for this land of Palestine, and end at once these tedious wars? Yonder are the lists ready,
nor can Paynimrie ever hope a better champion than thou. I, unless worthier offers, will lay
down my gauntlet in behalf of Christendom, and, in all love and honor, we will do mortal battle
for the possession of Jerusalem."

There was a deep pause for the Soldan's answer. His cheek and brow colored highly, and it was
the opinion of many present that he hesitated whether he should accept the challenge. At length
he said: "Fighting for the Holy City against those whom we regard as idolaters, and worshippers
of stocks and stones, and graven images, I might confide that Allah would strengthen my arm;
or if I fell beneath the sword of the Melech Ric, I could not pass to Paradise by a more glorious
death. But Allah has already given Jerusalem to the true believers, and it were a tempting
the God of the Prophet to peril, upon my own personal strength and skill, that which I hold
securely by the superiority of my forces."

"If not for Jerusalem, then," said Richard, in the tone of one who would entreat a favor of
an intimate friend, "yet, for the love of honor, let us run at least three courses with grinded
lances."

"Even this," said Saladin, half smiling at Coeur de Lion's affectionate earnestness for the
combat, "even this I may not lawfully do. The Master places the shepherd over the flock, not
for the shepherd's own sake, but for the sake of the sheep. Had I a son to hold the sceptre
when I fell, I might have had the liberty, as I have the will, to brave this bold encounter;
but your own Scripture sayeth, that when the herdsman is smitten, the sheep are scattered."

"Thou hast had all the fortune," said Richard, turning to the Earl of Huntingdon with a sigh.
"I would have given the best year of my life for that one half-hour beside the Diamond of the
Desert!"

The chivalrous extravagance of Richard awakened the spirits of the assembly, and when at length
they arose to depart, Saladin advanced and took Coeur de Lion by the hand.

"Noble King of England," he said, "we now part, never to meet again. That your league is dissolved,
no more to be reunited, and that your native forces are far too few to enable you to prosecute
your enterprise, is as well known to me as to yourself. I may not yield you up that Jerusalem
which you so much desire to hold. It is to us, as to you, a Holy City. But whatever other terms
Richard demands of Saladin, shall be as willingly yielded as yonder fountain yields its waters.
Ay, and the same should be as frankly afforded by Saladin, if Richard stood in the desert with
but two archers in his train!"

FOOTNOTES:

[I] While the army of the crusaders was inactive near Ascalon, a truce having been agreed to
between the Saracens and their assailants, the Grand Master of the Templars, Conrade Marquis
of Montserrat, and others of the Christian Princes, were plotting to effect its dismemberment.
Richard of England was the leading spirit of the crusade, and the plotters wished either to
get rid of him or to inspire his colleagues with jealousy of his leadership. The Grand Master
sought to have the King assassinated. Conrade tried to break up the league by milder means:
he first provoked the Duke of Austria to insult the English banner; and then thinking rightly
that the suspicion and wrath of Richard would fall upon Austria, he secretly stole the banner
from its place. Its safe-keeping, after Austria's insult, had been entrusted by the King to
Sir Kenneth, known as the Knight of the Leopard, in reality David Prince of Scotland, who in
the disguise of an obscure gentleman had joined the crusade as a follower of the English King.
Sir Kenneth was innocently decoyed from his watch, and in his absence, the banner, left with
but his dog to guard it, was stolen by Conrade. For his failure of duty. Sir Kenneth was condemned
to immediate death, but Saladin, who in the disguise of an Arab physician was in the English
camp, and who had rescued the King from death by fever, urgently interceding, his life was
spared. Saladin took Sir Kenneth to the camp of the Saracens, and knowing his worth and valor,
having previously had knightly encounter with him in the desert, disguised him as a Nubian
slave, and sent him as a present to Richard with the hope that he might in some way discover
by whom the banner had been stolen. Attending Richard as a slave Sir Kenneth saved the king
from the assassination which the Grand Master had instigated, and aided by the instinct of
his dog, also disguised, he detected the thief in Conrade. Richard thereupon, at once charged
Conrade with the theft, and challenged him to mortal combat. The King was prevented by the
Council of the Princes from fighting in person, but having divined in the Nubian slave the
former Knight of the Leopard, he permitted Sir Kenneth to fight in his stead, that the knight
might atone for the dishonor of being faithless in his watch. Conrade's cause was espoused
by the Grand Master, who had been his confidant, and by the Duke of Austria. The encounter
was appointed to take place at the Diamond of the Desert, in the territory of Saladin, who
was asked to act as umpire. It had been stipulated that but five hundred Saracens should be
present at the trial; Saladin, however, having been apprised of further plotting on the part
of the Grand Master, for safety's sake caused a larger attendance of his followers. Sir Kenneth
had long loved Edith Plantagenet, but being known to her only as a poor and nameless adventurer,
he had not yet openly avowed his love.

XXXI. TO A HIGHLAND GIRL.

(AT INVERSNEYDE, UPON LOCH LOMOND.)

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.--1770-1850.

    Sweet Highland girl, a very shower
    Of beauty is thy earthly dower!
    Twice seven consenting years have shed
    Their utmost bounty on thy head:
    And these gray rocks; this household lawn;
    These trees, a veil just half withdrawn;
    This fall of water, that doth make
    A murmur near the silent lake;
    This little bay, a quiet road
    That holds in shelter thy abode;
    In truth, together do ye seem
    Like something fashion'd in a dream;
    Such forms as from their covert peep
    When earthly cares are laid asleep!
    Yet, dream and vision as thou art,
    I bless thee with a human heart:
    God shield thee to thy latest years!
    Thee neither know I nor thy peers;
    And yet my eyes are fill'd with tears.

      With earnest feeling I shall pray
    For thee when I am far away:
    For never saw I mien, or face,
    In which more plainly I could trace
    Benignity and home-bred sense
    Ripening in perfect innocence.
    Here scatter'd like a random seed,
    Remote from men, thou dost not need
    The embarrass'd look of shy distress,
    And maidenly shamefacèdness:
    Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
    The freedom of a mountaineer:
    A face with gladness overspread!
    Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!
    And seemliness complete, that sways
    Thy courtesies, about thee plays;
    With no restraint, but such as springs
    From quick and eager visitings
    Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach
    Of thy few words of English speech:
    A bondage sweetly brook'd, a strife
    That gives thy gestures grace and life!
    So have I, not unmov'd in mind,
    Seen birds of tempest-loving kind,
    Thus beating up against the wind.

      What hand but would a garland cull
    For thee who art so beautiful?
    O happy pleasure! here to dwell
    Beside thee in some heathy dell;
    Adopt your homely ways, and dress,
    A shepherd, thou a shepherdess!
    But I could frame a wish for thee
    More like a grave reality:
    Thou art to me but as a wave
    Of the wild sea; and I would have
    Some claim upon thee, if I could,
    Though but of common neighborhood.
    What joy to hear thee, and to see!
    Thy elder brother I would be,
    Thy father, anything to thee!

      Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace
    Hath led me to this lonely place.
    Joy have I had; and going hence
    I bear away my recompense.
    In spots like these it is we prize
    Our memory, feel that she hath eyes:
    Then, why should I be loth to stir?
    I feel this place was made for her;
    To give new pleasure like the past,
    Continued long as life shall last.
    Nor am I loth, though pleas'd at heart,
    Sweet Highland girl! from thee to part;
    For I, methinks, till I grow old,
    As fair before me shall behold,
    As I do now, the cabin small,
    The lake, the bay, the waterfall;
    And thee, the spirit of them all!

XXXII. FRANCE: AN ODE.

(1797.)

SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.--1772-1834.

I.

    Ye Clouds! that far above me float and pause,
      Whose pathless march no mortal may control!
      Ye Ocean-Waves! that, wheresoe'er ye roll,
    Yield homage only to eternal laws!
    Ye Woods! that listen to the night-birds singing,
      Midway the smooth and perilous slope reclin'd,
    Save when your own imperious branches, swinging,
      Have made a solemn music of the wind!
        Where, like a man belov'd of God,
        Through glooms, which never woodman trod,
      How oft, pursuing fancies holy,
    My moonlight way o'er flowering weeds I wound,
      Inspir'd, beyond the guess of folly,
    By each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound!
    O ye loud Waves! and O ye Forests high!
      And O ye Clouds that far above me soar'd!
    Thou rising Sun! thou blue rejoicing Sky!
    Yea, every thing that is and will be free!
    Bear witness for me, wheresoe'er ye be,
      With what deep worship I have still ador'd
    The spirit of divinest Liberty.

II.

    When France in wrath her giant-limbs uprear'd,
      And with that oath, which smote air, earth, and sea,
      Stamp'd her strong foot and said she would be free,
    Bear witness for me, how I hoped and fear'd!
    With what a joy my lofty gratulation
      Unaw'd I sang, amid a slavish band;
    And when to whelm the disenchanted nation,
      Like fiends embattled by a wizard's wand.
        The Monarchs march'd in evil day,
        And Britain join'd the dire array,
      Though dear her shores and circling ocean,
    Though many friendships, many youthful loves,
      Had swoll'n the patriot emotion,
    And flung a magic light o'er all her hills and groves;
    Yet still my voice, unalter'd, sang defeat
      To all that brav'd the tyrant-quelling lance,
    And shame too long delay'd and vain retreat!
    For ne'er, O Liberty! with partial aim
    I dimm'd thy light or damp'd thy holy flame;
      But bless'd the pæans of deliver'd France,
    And hung my head and wept at Britain's name.

III.

    "And what," I said, "though Blasphemy's loud scream
      With that sweet music of deliverance strove!
      Though all the fierce and drunken passions wove
    A dance more wild than e'er was maniac's dream!
    Ye Storms, that round the dawning east assembled,
      The Sun was rising, though ye hid his light!"
    And when, to soothe my soul, that hoped and trembled,
      The dissonance ceas'd, and all seem'd calm and bright;
        When France her front deep-scarr'd and gory
        Conceal'd with clustering wreaths of glory;
      When, insupportably advancing,
    Her arm made mockery of the warrior's tramp,
      While, timid looks of fury glancing,
    Domestic treason, crush'd beneath her fatal stamp,
    Writh'd like a wounded dragon in his gore:
      Then I reproach'd my fears that would not flee;
    "And soon," I said, "shall Wisdom teach her lore
    In the low huts of them that toil and groan!
    And, conquering by her happiness alone,
      Shall France compel the nations to be free,
    Till Love and Joy look round, and call the earth their own."

IV.

    Forgive me, Freedom! O forgive those dreams!
      I hear thy voice, I hear thy loud lament,
      From bleak Helvetia's icy cavern sent,--
    I hear thy groans upon her blood-stain'd streams!
    Heroes, that for your peaceful country perish'd,
      And ye that, fleeing, spot your mountain-snows
    With bleeding wounds, forgive me, that I cherish'd
      One thought that ever bless'd your cruel foes!
        To scatter rage, and traitorous guilt,
        Where Peace her jealous home had built;
      A patriot-race to disinherit
    Of all that made their stormy wilds so dear,
      And with inexpiable spirit
    To taint the bloodless freedom of the mountaineer,--
    O France, that mockest Heaven, adulterous, blind,
      And patriot only in pernicious toils,
    Are these thy boasts, champion of human kind?
    To mix with kings in the low lust of sway,
    Yell in the hunt, and share the murderous prey;
      To insult the shrine of Liberty with spoils
    From freemen torn; to tempt and to betray?

V.

    The Sensual and the Dark rebel in vain,
      Slaves by their own compulsion! In mad game
      They burst their manacles and wear the name
    Of Freedom, graven on a heavier chain!
    O Liberty! with profitless endeavor
      Have I pursued thee, many a weary hour;
    But thou nor swell'st the victor's strain, nor ever
      Didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power.
        Alike from all, howe'er they praise thee
        (Nor prayer, nor boastful name delays thee),
      Alike from Priestcraft's harpy minions,
    And factious Blasphemy's obscener slaves,
      Thou speedest on thy subtle pinions,
    The guide of homeless winds, and playmate of the waves!
    And there I felt thee!--on that sea-cliff's verge,
      Whose pines, scarce travell'd by the breeze above,
    Had made one murmur with the distant surge!
    Yes, while I stood and gaz'd, my temples bare,
    And shot my being through earth, sea, and air,
      Possessing all things with intensest love,
    O Liberty! my spirit felt thee there.

XXXIII. COMPLAINT AND REPROOF.

COLERIDGE.

I.

    How seldom, friend! a good great man inherits
    Honor or wealth, with all his worth and pains!
    It sounds like stories from the land of spirits,
    If any man obtain that which he merits,
    Or any merit that which he obtains.

II.

    For shame, dear friend! renounce this canting strain!
    What wouldst thou have a good great man obtain?
    Place--titles--salary--a gilded chain--
    Or throne of corses which his sword hath slain?--
    Greatness and goodness are not means but ends!
    Hath he not always treasures, always friends,
    The good great man?--three treasures,--love, and light,
    And calm thoughts, regular as infant's breath;--
    And three firm friends, more sure than day and night,--
    Himself, his Maker, and the angel Death.

XXXIV. THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE.

ROBERT SOUTHEY.--1774-1843.

    A well there is in the west country,
      And a clearer one never was seen;
    There is not a wife in the west country
      But has heard of the Well of St. Keyne.

    An oak and an elm-tree stand beside,
      And behind doth an ash-tree grow,
    And a willow from the bank above
      Droops to the water below.

    A traveller came to the Well of St. Keyne;
      Joyfully he drew nigh;
    For from cock-crow he had been travelling,
      And there was not a cloud in the sky.

    He drank of the water so cool and clear,
      For thirsty and hot was he;
    And he sat down upon the bank
      Under the willow-tree.

    There came a man from the house hard by,
      At the well to fill his pail;
    On the well-side he rested it,
      And he bade the stranger hail.

    "Now, art thou a bachelor, stranger?" quoth he;
      "For, an if thou hast a wife,
    The happiest draught thou hast drank this day
      That ever thou didst in thy life.

    "Or has thy good woman, if one thou hast,
      Ever here in Cornwall been?
    For, an if she have, I'll venture my life
      She has drank of the Well of St. Keyne."

    "I have left a good woman who never was here,"
      The stranger he made reply;
    "But that my draught should be the better for that,
      I pray you answer me why."

    "St. Keyne," quoth the Cornish-man, "many a time
      Drank of this crystal well;
    And, before the angel summon'd her,
      She laid on the water a spell,--

    "If the husband of this gifted well
      Shall drink before his wife,
    A happy man thenceforth is he,
      For he shall be master for life;

    "But if the wife should drink of it first,
      God help the husband then!"
    The stranger stoop'd to the Well of St. Keyne,
      And drank of the water again.

    "You drank of the well, I warrant, betimes?"
      He to the Cornish-man said;
    But the Cornish-man smiled as the stranger spake,
      And sheepishly shook his head:--

    "I hasten'd, as soon as the wedding was done,
      And left my wife in the porch;
    But i' faith she had been wiser than me,
      For she took a bottle to church."

XXXV. THE ISLES OF GREECE.

LORD BYRON.--1788-1824.

    The isles of Greece! the isles of Greece!
      Where burning Sappho lov'd and sung,
    Where grew the arts of war and peace,
      Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
    Eternal summer gilds them yet,
    But all, except their sun, is set.

    The Scian and the Teian muse,
      The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
    Have found the fame your shores refuse:
      Their place of birth alone is mute
    To sounds which echo further west
    Than your sires' "Islands of the Blest."

    The mountains look on Marathon--
      And Marathon looks on the sea;
    And musing there an hour alone,
      I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
    For standing on the Persians' grave,
    I could not deem myself a slave.

    A king sate on the rocky brow
      Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
    And ships, by thousands, lay below,
      And men in nations;--all were his!
    He counted them at break of day--
    And when the sun set, where were they?

    And where are they? and where art thou,
      My country? On thy voiceless shore
    The heroic lay is tuneless now--
      The heroic bosom beats no more!
    And must thy lyre, so long divine,
    Degenerate into hands like mine?

    'Tis something, in the dearth of fame,
      Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
    To feel at least a patriot's shame,
      Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
    For what is left the poet here?
    For Greeks a blush--for Greece a tear.

    Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
      Must we but blush?--Our fathers bled.
    Earth! render back from out thy breast
      A remnant of our Spartan dead!
    Of the three hundred grant but three,
    To make a new Thermopylæ!

    In vain--in vain: strike other chords;
      Fill high the cup with Samian wine!
    Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
      And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
    Hark! rising to the ignoble call--
    How answers each bold Bacchanal!

    You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet;
      Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
    Of two such lessons, why forget
      The nobler and the manlier one?
    You have the letters Cadmus gave--
    Think ye he meant them for a slave?

    Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
      We will not think of themes like these!
    It made Anacreon's song divine:
      He served--but served Polycrates--
    A tyrant; but our masters then
    Were still, at least, our countrymen.

    The tyrant of the Chersonese
      Was freedom's best and bravest friend;
    That tyrant was Miltiades!
      Oh! that the present hour would lend
    Another despot of the kind!
    Such chains as his were sure to bind.

    Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
      On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
    Exists the remnant of a line
      Such as the Doric mothers bore;
    And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
    The Heracleidan blood might own.

    Trust not for freedom to the Franks--
      They have a king who buys and sells:
    In native swords, and native ranks,
      The only hope of courage dwells;
    But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
    Would break your shield, however broad.

    Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
      Our virgins dance beneath the shade--
    I see their glorious black eyes shine;
      But gazing on each glowing maid,
    My own the burning tear-drop laves,
    To think such breasts must suckle slaves.

    Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,
      Where nothing, save the waves and I,
    May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
      There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
    A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine--
    Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!

XXXVI. GO WHERE GLORY WAITS THEE.

THOMAS MOORE.--1779-1852.

    Go where glory waits thee;
    But, while fame elates thee,
        O, still remember me!
    When the praise thou meetest
    To thine ear is sweetest,
        O, then remember me!
    Other arms may press thee,
    Dearer friends caress thee,
    All the joys that bless thee
        Sweeter far may be;
    But when friends are nearest,
    And when joys are dearest,
        O, then remember me!

    When, at eve, thou rovest
    By the star thou lovest,
        O, then remember me!
    Think, when home returning,
    Bright we've seen it burning,
        O, thus remember me!
    Oft as summer closes,
    When thine eye reposes
    On its lingering roses,
        Once so lov'd by thee,
    Think of her who wove them,
    Her who made thee love them,
        O, then remember me!

    When, around thee dying,
    Autumn leaves are lying,
        O, then remember me!
    And, at night, when gazing
    On the gay hearth blazing,
        O, still remember me!
    Then, should music, stealing
    All the soul of feeling,
    To thy heart appealing,
        Draw one tear from thee;
    Then let memory bring thee
    Strains I used to sing thee,--
        O, then remember me!

XXXVII. DEAR HARP OF MY COUNTRY.

MOORE.

    Dear Harp of my Country! in darkness I found thee,
      The cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee long,
    When proudly, my own Island Harp, I unbound thee,
      And gave all thy chords to light, freedom, and song!

    The warm lay of love and the light note of gladness
      Have waken'd thy fondest, thy liveliest thrill;
    But, so oft hast thou echo'd the deep sigh of sadness,
      That ev'n in thy mirth it will steal from thee still.

    Dear Harp of my Country! farewell to thy numbers,
      This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall twine!
    Go, sleep with the sunshine of fame on thy slumbers,
      Till touch'd by some hand less unworthy than mine;

    If the pulse of the patriot, soldier, or lover,
      Have throbb'd at our lay, 'tis thy glory alone;
    I was but as the wind, passing heedlessly over,
      And all the wild sweetness I waked was thy own.

XXXVIII. COME, YE DISCONSOLATE.

MOORE.

    Come, ye disconsolate, where'er you languish,
      Come, at God's altar fervently kneel;
    Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish--
      Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.

    Joy of the desolate, Light of the straying,
      Hope, when all others die, fadeless and pure,
    Here speaks the Comforter, in God's name saying,--
      "Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot cure."

    Go, ask the infidel, what boon he brings us,
      What charm for aching hearts he can reveal,
    Sweet as that heavenly promise Hope sings us,
      "Earth has no sorrow that God cannot heal."

XXXIX. ON A LOCK OF MILTON'S HAIR.

LEIGH HUNT.--1784-1859.

    It lies before me there, and my own breath
    Stirs its thin outer threads, as though beside
    The living head I stood in honor'd pride,
    Talking of lovely things that conquer death.
    Perhaps he press'd it once, or underneath
    Ran his fine fingers, when he leant, blank-ey'd,
    And saw, in fancy, Adam and his bride
    With their rich locks, or his own Delphic wreath.
    There seems a love in hair, though it be dead.
    It is the gentlest, yet the strongest thread
    Of our frail plant,--a blossom from the tree
    Surviving the proud trunk;--as though it said
    Patience and gentleness is power; in me
    Behold affectionate eternity.

XL. THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS.

LEIGH HUNT.

    King Francis was a hearty king, and lov'd a royal sport,
    And one day, as his lions strove, sat looking on the court:
    The nobles fill'd the benches round, the ladies by their side,
    And 'mongst them Count de Lorge, with one he hoped to make
              his bride;
    And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,
    Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.

    Ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;
    They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with
              their paws;
    With wallowing might and stifled roar they roll'd one on another,
    Till all the pit, with sand and mane, was in a thund'rous smother;
    The bloody foam above the bars came whizzing through the air;
    Said Francis then, "Good gentlemen, we're better here than there!"

    De Lorge's love o'erheard the King, a beauteous, lively dame,
    With smiling lips, and sharp bright eyes, which always seem'd
              the same:
    She thought, "The Count, my lover, is as brave as brave can be;
    He surely would do desperate things to show his love of me!
    King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the chance is wondrous fine;
    I'll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory will be mine!"

    She dropp'd her glove to prove his love: then look'd on him
              and smiled;
    He bow'd, and in a moment leap'd among the lions wild:
    The leap was quick; return was quick; he soon regain'd his place;
    Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face!
    "In truth!" cried Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose from where
              he sat:
    "No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task like that!"

XLII. ON FIRST LOOKING INTO CHAPMAN'S HOMER.

JOHN KEATS.--1795-1821.

    Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
    And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
    Round many western islands have I been
    Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
    Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
    That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne:
    Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
    Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
    Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
    When a new planet swims into his ken;
    Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
    He stared at the Pacific--and all his men
    Look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
    Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

XLIII. ON THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET.

XLIV. THE POWER AND DANGER OF THE CÆSARS.

THOMAS DE QUINCEY.--1785-1859.

From THE CÆSARS.

To this view of the imperial character and relations must be added one single circumstance,
which in some measure altered the whole for the individual who happened to fill the office.
The emperor de facto might be viewed under two aspects; there was the man, and there was the
office. In his office he was immortal and sacred: but as a question might still be raised,
by means of a mercenary army, as to the claims of the particular individual who at any time
filled the office, the very sanctity and privilege of the character with which he was clothed
might actually be turned against himself; and here it is, at this point, that the character
of Roman emperor became truly and mysteriously awful. Gibbon has taken notice of the extraordinary
situation of a subject in the Roman empire who should attempt to fly from the wrath of the
Cæsar. Such was the ubiquity of the emperor that this was metaphysically hopeless. Except across
pathless deserts or amongst barbarous nomads, it was impossible to find even a transient sanctuary
from the imperial pursuit. If the fugitive went down to the sea, there he met the emperor:
if he took the wings of the morning, and fled to the uttermost parts of the earth, there was
also Cæsar in the person of his lieutenants. But, by a dreadful counter-charm, the same omnipresence
of imperial anger and retribution which withered the hopes of the poor humble prisoner, met
and confounded the emperor himself, when hurled from his elevation by some fortunate rival.
All the kingdoms of the earth, to one in that situation, became but so many wards of the same
infinite prison. Flight, if it were even successful for the moment, did but a little retard
his inevitable doom. And so evident was this, that hardly in one instance did the fallen prince
attempt to fly; passively he met the death which was inevitable, in the very spot where ruin
had overtaken him. Neither was it possible even for a merciful conqueror to show mercy; for,
in the presence of an army so mercenary and factious, his own safety was but too deeply involved
in the extermination of rival pretenders to the crown.

Such, amidst the sacred security and inviolability of the office, was the hazardous tenure
of the individual. Nor did his dangers always arise from persons in the rank of competitors
and rivals. Sometimes it menaced him in quarters which his eye had never penetrated, and from
enemies too obscure to have reached his ear. By way of illustration we will cite a case from
the life of the Emperor Commodus, which is wild enough to have furnished the plot of a romance,
though as well authenticated as any other passage in that reign. The story is narrated by Herodian,
and the outline was this:--A slave of noble qualities, and of magnificent person, having liberated
himself from the degradations of bondage, determined to avenge his own wrongs by inflicting
continual terror upon the town and neighborhood which had witnessed his humiliation. For this
purpose he resorted to the woody recesses of the province (somewhere in the modern Transylvania),
and, attracting to his wild encampment as many fugitives as he could, by degrees he succeeded
in training a very formidable troop of freebooters. Partly from the energy of his own nature,
and partly from the neglect and remissness of the provincial magistrates, the robber captain
rose from less to more, until he had formed a little army, equal to the task of assaulting
fortified cities. In this stage of his adventures he encountered and defeated several of the
imperial officers commanding large detachments of troops; and at length grew of consequence
sufficient to draw upon himself the emperor's eye, and the honor of his personal displeasure.
In high wrath and disdain at the insults offered to his eagles by this fugitive slave, Commodus
fulminated against him such an edict as left him no hope of much longer escaping with impunity.

Public vengeance was now awakened; the imperial troops were marching from every quarter upon
the same centre; and the slave became sensible that in a very short space of time he must be
surrounded and destroyed. In this desperate situation he took a desperate resolution: he assembled
his troops, laid before them his plan, concerted the various steps for carrying it into effect,
and then dismissed them as independent wanderers. So ends the first chapter of the tale.

The next opens in the passes of the Alps, whither, by various routes, of seven or eight hundred
miles in extent, these men had threaded their way in manifold disguises, through the very midst
of the emperor's camps. According to this man's gigantic enterprise, in which the means were
as audacious as the purpose, the conspirators were to rendezvous, and first to recognize each
other, at the gates of Rome. From the Danube to the Tiber did this band of robbers severally
pursue their perilous routes through all the difficulties of the road and the jealousies of
the military stations, sustained by the mere thirst of vengeance--vengeance against that mighty
foe whom they knew only by his proclamations against themselves. Everything continued to prosper;
the conspirators met under the walls of Rome; the final details were arranged; and those also
would have prospered but for a trifling accident. The season was one of general carnival at
Rome; and, by the help of those disguises which the license of this festival time allowed,
the murderers were to have penetrated as maskers to the emperor's retirement, when a casual
word or two awoke the suspicions of a sentinel. One of the conspirators was arrested; under
the terror and uncertainty of the moment, he made much ampler discoveries than were expected
of him; the other accomplices were secured: and Commodus was delivered from the uplifted daggers
of those who had sought him by months of patient wanderings, pursued through all the depths
of the Illyrian forests, and the difficulties of the Alpine passes. It is not easy to find
words of admiration commensurate to the energetic hardihood of a slave--who, by way of answer
and reprisal to an edict summarily consigning him to persecution and death, determines to cross
Europe in quest of its author, though no less a person than the master of the world--to seek
him out in the inmost recesses of his capital city, of his private palace, of his consecrated
bed-chamber--and there to lodge a dagger in his heart, as the adequate reply to the imperial
sentence of proscription against himself.

Such, amidst the superhuman grandeur and hallowed privileges of the Roman emperor's office,
were the extraordinary perils which menaced the individual officer. The office rose by its
grandeur to a region above the clouds and vapors of earth: the officer might find his personal
security as unsubstantial as those wandering vapors. Nor is it possible that these circumstances
of violent opposition can be better illustrated than in this tale of Herodian. Whilst the emperor's
mighty arms were stretched out to arrest some potentate in the heart of Asia, a poor slave
is silently and stealthily creeping round the base of the Alps, with the purpose of winning
his way as a murderer to the imperial bed-chamber; Cæsar is watching some potent rebel of the
Orient, at a distance of two thousand leagues, and he overlooks the dagger which is within
three stealthy steps, and one tiger's leap, of his own heart. All the heights and the depths
which belong to man's frailty, all the contrasts of glory and meanness, the extremities of
what is highest and lowest in human casualties, meeting in the station of the Roman Cæsar Semper
Augustus--have combined to call him into high marble relief, and to make him the most interesting
study of all whom history has emblazoned with colors of fire and blood, or has crowned most
lavishly with diadems of cyprus and laurel.

XLV. UNTHOUGHTFULNESS.

DR. ARNOLD.--1795-1842.

A Lecture delivered in Rugby Chapel.

The state of spiritual folly is, I suppose, one of the most universal evils in the world. For
the number of those who are naturally foolish is exceedingly great; of those, I mean, who understand
no worldly thing well; of those who are careless about everything, carried about by every breath
of opinion, without knowledge, and without principle. But the term spiritual folly includes,
unhappily, a great many more than these; it takes in not those only who are in the common sense
of the term foolish, but a great many who are in the common sense of the term clever, and many
who are even in the common sense of the terms, prudent, sensible, thoughtful, and wise. It
is but too evident that some of the ablest men who have ever lived upon earth, have been in
no less a degree spiritually fools. And thus, it is not without much truth that Christian writers
have dwelt upon the insufficiency of worldly wisdom, and have warned their readers to beware,
lest, while professing themselves to be wise, they should be accounted as fools in the sight
of God.

But the opposite to this notion, that those who are, as it were, fools in worldly matters are
wise before God,--although this also is true in a certain sense, and under certain peculiar
circumstances, yet taken generally, it is the very reverse of truth; and the careless and incautious
language which has been often used on this subject, has been extremely mischievous. On the
contrary, he who is foolish in worldly matters is likely also to be, and most commonly is,
no less foolish in the things of God. And the opposite belief has arisen mainly from that strange
confusion between ignorance and innocence, with which many ignorant persons seem to solace
themselves. Whereas, if you take away a man's knowledge, you do not bring him to the state
of an infant, but to that of a brute; and of one of the most mischievous and malignant of the
brute creation. For you do not lessen or weaken the man's body by lowering his mind; he still
retains his strength and his passions, the passions leading to self-indulgence, the strength
which enables him to feed them by continued gratification. He will not think, it is true, to
any good purpose; it is very possible to destroy in him the power of reflection, whether as
exercised upon outward things, or upon himself and his own nature, or upon God. But you cannot
destroy the power of adapting means to ends, nor that of concealing his purposes by fraud or
falsehood; you take only his wisdom, and leave that cunning which marks so notoriously both
the savage and the madman. He, then, who is a fool as far as regards earthly things, is much
more a fool with regard to heavenly things; he who cannot raise himself even to the lower height,
how is he to attain to the higher? he who is without reason and conscience, how shall he be
endowed with the spirit of God?

It is my deep conviction and long experience of this truth, which makes me so grieve over a
want of interest in your own improvement in human learning, whenever I observe it,--over the
prevalence of a thoughtless and childish spirit amongst you.... The idleness and want of interest
which I grieve for, is one which extends itself, but too impartially, to knowledge of every
kind: to divine knowledge, as might be expected, even more than to human. Those whom we commonly
find careless about their general lessons, are quite as ignorant and as careless about their
Bibles; those who have no interest in general literature, in poetry, or in history, or in philosophy,
have certainly no greater interest, I do not say in works of theology, but in works of practical
devotion, in the lives of holy men, in meditations, or in prayers. Alas, the interest of their
minds is bestowed on things far lower than the very lowest of all which I have named; and therefore,
to see them desiring something only a little higher than their present pursuits, could not
but be encouraging; it would, at least, show that the mind was rising upwards. It may, indeed,
stop at a point short of the highest, it may learn to love earthly excellence, and rest there
contented, and seek for nothing more perfect; but that, at any rate, is a future and merely
contingent evil. It is better to love earthly excellence than earthly folly; it is far better
in itself, and it is, by many degrees, nearer to the Kingdom of God.

There is another case, however, which I cannot but think is more frequent now than formerly;
and if it is so, it may be worth while to direct our attention to it. Common idleness and absolute
ignorance are not what I wish to speak of now, but a character advanced above these; a character
which does not neglect its school-lessons, but really attains to considerable proficiency in
them; a character at once regular and amiable, abstaining from evil, and for evil in its low
and grosser forms having a real abhorrence. What, then, you will say, is wanting here? I will
tell you what seems to be wanting--a spirit of manly, and much more of Christian, thoughtfulness.
There is quickness and cleverness; much pleasure, perhaps, in distinction, but little in improvement;
there is no desire of knowledge for its own sake, whether human or divine. There is, therefore,
but little power of combining and digesting what is read; and, consequently, what is read passes
away, and takes no root in the mind. This same character shows itself in matters of conduct;
it will adopt, without scruple, the most foolish, commonplace notions of boys, about what is
right and wrong; it will not, and cannot, from the lightness of its mind, concern itself seriously
about what is evil in the conduct of others, because it takes no regular care of its own, with
reference to pleasing God; it will not do anything low or wicked, but it will sometimes laugh
at those who do; and it will by no means take pains to encourage, nay, it will sometimes thwart
and oppose anything that breathes a higher spirit, and asserts a more manly and Christian standard
of duty.

One cause of this consists in the number and character and cheapness, and peculiar mode of
publication, of the works of amusement of the present day. The works of amusement published
only a very few years since were comparatively few in number; they were less exciting, and
therefore less attractive; they were dearer, and therefore less accessible; and, not being
published periodically, they did not occupy the mind for so long a time, nor keep alive so
constant an expectation; nor, by thus dwelling upon the mind, and distilling themselves into
it as it were drop by drop, did they possess it so largely, coloring even, in many instances,
its very language, and affording frequent matter for conversation.

The evil of all these circumstances is actually enormous. The mass of human minds, and much
more of the minds of young persons, have no great appetite for intellectual exercise; but they
have some, which by careful treatment may be strengthened and increased. But here to this weak
and delicate appetite is presented an abundance of the most stimulating and least nourishing
food possible. It snatches it greedily, and is not only satisfied, but actually conceives a
distaste for anything simpler and more wholesome. That curiosity which is wisely given us to
lead us on to knowledge, finds its full gratification in the details of an exciting and protracted
story, and then lies down as it were gorged, and goes to sleep. Other faculties claim their
turn, and have it. We know that in youth the healthy body and lively spirits require exercise,
and in this they may and ought to be indulged; but the time and interest which remain over
when the body has had its enjoyment, and the mind desires its share, this has been already
wasted and exhausted upon things utterly unprofitable: so that the mind goes to its work hurriedly
and languidly, and feels it to be no more than a burden. The mere lessons may be learnt from
a sense of duty; but that freshness of power which in young persons of ability would fasten
eagerly upon some one portion or other of the wide field of knowledge, and there expatiate,
drinking in health and strength to the mind, as surely as the natural exercise of the body
gives to it bodily vigor,--that is tired prematurely, perverted, and corrupted; and all the
knowledge which else it might so covet, it now seems a wearying effort to retain.

Great and grievous as is the evil, it is peculiarly hard to find the remedy for it. If the
books to which I have been alluding were books of downright wickedness, we might destroy them
wherever we found them; we might forbid their open circulation; we might conjure you to shun
them as you would any other clear sin, whether of word or deed. But they are not wicked books
for the most part; they are of that class which cannot be actually prohibited; nor can it be
pretended that there is a sin in reading them. They are not the more wicked for being published
so cheap, and at regular intervals; but yet these two circumstances make them so peculiarly
injurious. All that can be done is to point out the evil; that it is real and serious I am
very sure, and its defects are most deplorable on the minds of the fairest promise; but the
remedy for it rests with yourselves, or rather with each of you individually, so far as he
is himself concerned. That an unnatural and constant excitement of the mind is most injurious,
there is no doubt; that excitement involves a consequent weakness, is a law of our nature than
which none is surer; that the weakness of mind thus produced is and must be adverse to quiet
study and thought, to that reflection which alone is wisdom, is also clear in itself, and proved
too largely by experience. And that without reflection there can be no spiritual understanding,
is at once evident; while without spiritual understanding, that is, without a knowledge and
a study of God's will, there can be no spiritual life. And therefore childishness and unthoughtfulness
cannot be light evils; and if I have rightly traced the prevalence of these defects to its
cause, although that cause may seem to some to be trifling, yet surely it is well to call your
attention to it, and to remind you that in reading works of amusement, as in every other lawful
pleasure, there is and must be an abiding responsibility in the sight of God; that, like other
lawful pleasures, we must beware of excess in it; and not only so, but if we find it hurtful
to us, either because we have used it too freely in times past, or because our nature is too
weak to bear it, that then we are bound most solemnly to abstain from it; because, however
lawful in itself, or to others who can practise it without injury, whatever is to us an hindrance
in the way of our intellectual and moral and spiritual improvement, that is in our case a positive
sin.

XLVI. THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS.

THOMAS HOOD.--1799-1845.

    One more Unfortunate,
    Weary of breath,
    Rashly importunate,
    Gone to her death!

    Take her up tenderly,
    Lift her with care;
    Fashion'd so slenderly,
    Young, and so fair!

    Look at her garments
    Clinging like cerements;
    Whilst the wave constantly
    Drips from her clothing;
    Take her up instantly,
    Loving, not loathing.--

    Touch her not scornfully;
    Think of her mournfully,
    Gently and humanly;
    Not of the stains of her,--
    All that remains of her
    Now is pure womanly.

    Make no deep scrutiny
    Into her mutiny
    Rash and undutiful:
    Past all dishonor,
    Death has left on her
    Only the beautiful.

    Still, for all slips of hers,
    One of Eve's family,--
    Wipe those poor lips of hers
    Oozing so clammily.

    Loop up her tresses
    Escaped from the comb,--
    Her fair auburn tresses;
    Whilst wonderment guesses
    Where was her home?

    Who was her father?
    Who was her mother?
    Had she a sister?
    Had she a brother?
    Or was there a dearer one
    Still, and a nearer one
    Yet, than all other?

    Alas! for the rarity
    Of Christian charity
    Under the sun!
    Oh! it was pitiful!
    Near a whole city full,
    Home she had none.

    Sisterly, brotherly,
    Fatherly, motherly
    Feelings had changed:
    Love, by harsh evidence,
    Thrown from its eminence;
    Even God's providence
    Seeming estranged.

    Where the lamps quiver
    So far in the river,
    With many a light
    From window and casement,
    From garret to basement,
    She stood, with amazement,
    Houseless by night.

    The bleak wind of March
    Made her tremble and shiver;
    But not the dark arch,
    Or the black flowing river:
    Mad from life's history,
    Glad to death's mystery,
    Swift to be hurl'd--
    Anywhere, anywhere
    Out of the world!

    In she plunged boldly,--
    No matter how coldly
    The dark river ran,--
    Over the brink of it,
    Picture it,--think of it,
    Dissolute Man!
    Lave in it, drink of it,
    Then, if you can!

    Take her up tenderly,
    Lift her with care;
    Fashion'd so slenderly,
    Young, and so fair!

    Ere her limbs frigidly
    Stiffen too rigidly,
    Decently,--kindly,--
    Smooth and compose them;
    And her eyes, close them,
    Staring so blindly!

    Dreadfully staring
    Through muddy impurity,
    As when with the daring
    Last look of despairing
    Fix'd on futurity.

    Perishing gloomily,
    Spurr'd by contumely,
    Cold inhumanity,
    Burning insanity,
    Into her rest.--
    Cross her hands humbly,
    As if praying dumbly,
    Over her breast!

    Owning her weakness,
    Her evil behavior,
    And leaving, with meekness,
    Her sins to her Saviour!

XLVII. A PARENTAL ODE TO MY SON.

AGED THREE YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS.

THOMAS HOOD.

          Thou happy, happy elf!
    (But stop,--first let me kiss away that tear)--
          Thou tiny image of myself!
    (My love, he's poking peas into his ear!)
          Thou merry, laughing sprite!
          With spirits feather-light,
    Untouch'd by sorrow, and unsoil'd by sin--
    (Good heavens! the child is swallowing a pin!)
          Thou little tricksy Puck!
    With antic toys so funnily bestuck,
    Light as the singing bird that wings the air--
    (The door! the door! he'll tumble down the stair!)
          Thou darling of thy sire!
    (Why, Jane, he'll set his pinafore a-fire!)
          Thou imp of mirth and joy!
    In Love's dear chain so strong and bright a link,
    Thou idol of thy parents--(Drat the boy!
          There goes my ink!)

          Thou cherub--but of earth;
    Fit playfellow for Fays, by moonlight pale,
          In harmless sport and mirth,
    (That dog will bite him if he pulls its tail!)
          Thou human humming-bee extracting honey
    From ev'ry blossom in the world that blows,
          Singing in Youth's Elysium ever sunny,
    (Another tumble!--that's his precious nose!)
          Thy father's pride and hope!
    (He'll break the mirror with that skipping-rope!)
    With pure heart newly stamp'd from Nature's mint--
          (Where did he learn that squint?)

          Thou young domestic dove!
    (He'll have that jug off with another shove!)
          Dear nursling of the hymeneal nest!
          (Are those torn clothes his best?)
          Little epitome of man!
    (He'll climb upon the table, that's his plan!)
    Touch'd with the beauteous tints of dawning life--
          (He's got a knife!)

          Thou enviable being!
    No storms, no clouds, in thy blue sky foreseeing,
          Play on, play on,
          My elfin John!
          Toss the light ball--bestride the stick--
    (I knew so many cakes would make him sick!)
    With fancies buoyant as the thistle-down,
    Prompting the face grotesque, and antic brisk,
          With many a lamb-like frisk,
    (He's got the scissors, snipping at your gown!)

          Thou pretty opening rose!
    (Go to your mother, child, and wipe your nose!)
    Balmy, and breathing music like the South,
    (He really brings my heart into my mouth!)
    Fresh as the morn, and brilliant as its star,--
    (I wish that window had an iron bar!)
    Bold as the hawk, yet gentle as the dove,--
          (I tell you what, my love,
    I cannot write, unless he's sent above!)

XLVIII. METAPHYSICS.

THOMAS CHANDLER HALIBURTON.--1796-1865.

From TRAITS OF AMERICAN HUMOR.

Old Doctor Sobersides, the minister of Pumpkinville, where I lived in my youth, was one of
the metaphysical divines of the old school, and could cavil upon the ninth part of a hair about
entities and quiddities, nominalism and realism, free-will and necessity, with which sort of
learning he used to stuff his sermons and astound his learned hearers, the bumpkins. They never
doubted that it was all true, but were apt to say with the old woman in Molière: "He speaks
so well that I don't understand him a bit."

I remember a conversation that happened at my grandfather's, in which the Doctor had some difficulty
in making his metaphysics all "as clear as preaching." There was my grandfather; Uncle Tim,
who was the greatest hand at raising onions in our part of the country, but "not knowing metaphysics,
had no notion of the true reason of his not being sad"; my Aunt Judy Keturah Titterwell, who
could knit stockings "like all possest," but could not syllogise; Malachi Muggs, our hired
man that drove the oxen; and Isaac Thrasher, the district schoolmaster, who had dropped in
to warm his fingers and get a drink of cider. Something was under discussion, and my grandfather
could make nothing of it; but the Doctor said it was "metaphysically true."

"Pray, Doctor," said Uncle Tim, "tell me something about metaphysics; I have often heard of
that science, but never for my life could find out what it was."

"Metaphysics," said the Doctor, "is the science of abstraction."

"I'm no wiser for that explanation," said Uncle Tim.

"It treats," said the Doctor, "of matters most profound and sublime, a little difficult perhaps
for a common intellect or an unschooled capacity to fathom, but not the less important on that
account, to all living beings."

"What does it teach?" asked the Schoolmaster.

"It is not applied so much to the operation of teaching," answered the Doctor, "as to that
of inquiring; and the chief inquiry is, whether things are, or whether they are not."

"I don't understand the question," said Uncle Tim, taking the pipe out of his mouth.

"For example, whether this earth on which we tread," said the Doctor, giving a heavy stamp
on the floor, and setting his foot on the cat's tail, "whether the earth does really exist,
or whether it does not exist."

"That is a point of considerable consequence to settle," said my grandfather.

"Especially," added the schoolmaster, "to the holders of real estate."

"Now the earth," continued the Doctor, "may exist--"

"Why, who ever doubted that?" asked Uncle Tim.

"A great many men," said the Doctor, "and some very learned ones."

Uncle Tim stared a moment, and then began to fill his pipe, whistling the tune of "Heigh! Betty
Martin," while the Doctor went on:

"The earth, I say, may exist, although Bishop Berkeley has proved beyond all possible gainsaying
or denial, that it does not exist. The case is clear; the only difficulty is, to know whether
we shall believe it or not."

"And how," asked Uncle Tim, "is all this to be found out?"

"By digging down to the first principles," answered the Doctor.

"Ay," interrupted Malachi, "there is nothing equal to the spade and pickaxe."

"That is true," said my grandfather, going on in Malachi's way, "'tis by digging for the foundation,
that we shall find out whether the world exists or not; for, if we dig to the bottom of the
earth and find the foundation--why then we are sure of it. But if we find no foundation, it
is clear that the world stands upon nothing, or, in other words, that it does not stand at
all; therefore, it stands to reason--"

"I beg your pardon," interrupted the Doctor, "but you totally mistake me; I used the word digging
metaphorically, meaning the profoundest cogitation and research into the nature of things.
That is the way in which we may ascertain whether things are, or whether they are not."

"But if a man can't believe his eyes," said Uncle Tim, "what signifies talking about it?"

"Our eyes," said the Doctor, "are nothing at all but the inlets of sensation, and when we see
a thing, all we are aware of is, that we have a sensation of it: we are not aware that the
thing exists. We are sure of nothing that we see with our eyes."

"Not without spectacles," said Aunt Judy.

"Plato, for instance, maintains that the sensation of any object is produced by a perpetual
succession of copies, images, or counterfeits, streaming off from the object to the organ of
sensation. Descartes, too, has explained the matter upon the principle of whirligigs."

"But does the world exist?" asked the Schoolmaster.

"A good deal may be said on both sides," replied the Doctor, "though the ablest heads are for
non-existence."

"In common cases," said Uncle Tim, "those who utter nonsense are considered blockheads."

"But in metaphysics," said the Doctor, "the case is different."

"Now all this is hocus-pocus to me," said Aunt Judy, suspending her knitting-work, and scratching
her forehead with one of the needles, "I don't understand a bit more of the business than I
did at first."

"I'll be bound there is many a learned professor," said Uncle Tim, "could say the same after
spinning a long yarn of metaphysics."

The Doctor did not admire this gibe at his favorite science.

"That is as the case may be," said he; "this thing or that thing may be dubious, but what then?
Doubt is the beginning of wisdom."

"No doubt of that," said my grandfather, beginning to poke the fire, "and when a man has got
through his doubting, what does he begin to build up in the metaphysical way?"

"Why, he begins by taking something for granted," said the Doctor.

"But is that a sure way of going to work?"

"'Tis the only thing he can do," replied the Doctor, after a pause, and rubbing his forehead
as if he was not altogether satisfied that his foundation was a solid one. My grandfather might
have posed him with another question, but he poked the fire and let him go on.

"Metaphysics, to speak exactly----"

"Ah," interrupted the Schoolmaster, "bring it down to vulgar fractions, and then we shall understand
it."

"'Tis the consideration of immateriality, or the mere spirit and essence of things."

"Come, come," said Aunt Judy, taking a pinch of snuff, "now I see into it."

"Thus, man is considered, not in his corporeality, but in his essence or capability of being;
for a man, metaphysically, or to metaphysical purposes, hath two natures, that of spirituality,
and that of corporeality, which may be considered separate."

"What man?" asked Uncle Tim.

"Why, any man; Malachi there, for example; I may consider him as Malachi spiritual, or Malachi
corporeal."

"That is true," said Malachi, "for when I was in the militia they made me a sixteenth corporal,
and I carried grog to the drummer."

"That is another affair," said the Doctor in continuation; "we speak of man in his essence;
we speak, also, of the essence of locality, the essence of duration--"

"And essence of peppermint," said Aunt Judy.

"Pooh!" said the Doctor, "the essence I mean is quite a different essence."

"Something too fine to be dribbled through the worm of a still," said my grandfather.

"Then I am all in the dark again," rejoined Aunt Judy.

"By the spirit and essence of things I mean things in the abstract."

"And what becomes of a thing when it goes into the abstract?" asked Uncle Tim.

"Why, it becomes an abstraction."

"There we are again," said Uncle Tim; "but what on earth is an abstraction?"

"It is a thing that has no matter: that is, it cannot be felt, seen, heard, smelt, or tasted;
it has no substance or solidity; it is neither large nor small, hot nor cold, long nor short."

"Then what is the long and short of it?" asked the Schoolmaster.

"Abstraction," replied the Doctor.

"Suppose, for instance," said Malachi, "that I had a pitchfork----"

"Ay," said the Doctor, "consider a pitchfork in general; that is, neither this one nor that
one, nor any particular one, but a pitchfork or pitchforks divested of their materiality--these
are things in the abstract."

"They are things in the hay-mow," said Malachi.

"Pray," said Uncle Tim, "have there been many such things discovered?"

"Discovered!" returned the Doctor, "why, all things, whether in heaven, or upon the earth,
or in the waters under the earth, whether small or great, visible or invisible, animate or
inanimate; whether the eye can see, or the ear can hear, or the nose can smell, or the fingers
touch; finally, whatever exists or is imaginable in the nature of things, past, present, or
to come, all may be abstractions."

"Indeed!" said Uncle Tim, "pray, what do you make of the abstraction of a red cow?"

"A red cow," said the Doctor, "considered metaphysically or as an abstraction, is an animal
possessing neither hide nor horns, bones nor flesh, but is the mere type, eidolon, and fantastical
semblance of these parts of a quadruped. It has a shape without any substance, and no color
at all, for its redness is the mere counterfeit or imagination of such. As it lacks the positive,
so is it also deficient in the accidental properties of all the animals in its tribe, for it
has no locomotion, stability, or endurance, neither goes to pasture, gives milk, chews the
cud, nor performs any other function of the horned beast, but is a mere creation of the brain,
begotten by a freak of the fancy and nourished by a conceit of the imagination."

"Pshaw!" exclaimed Aunt Judy. "All the metaphysics under the sun wouldn't make a pound of butter!"

"That's a fact," said Uncle Tim.

XLIX. INDIAN SUMMER.[J]

SAMUEL LOVER.--1797-1868.

    When summer's verdant beauty flies,
    And autumn glows with richer dyes,
    A softer charm beyond them lies--
        It is the Indian summer.
    Ere winter's snows and winter's breeze
    Bereave of beauty all the trees,
    The balmy spring renewal sees
        In the sweet Indian summer.

    And thus, dear love, if early years
    Have drown'd the germ of joy in tears,
    A later gleam of hope appears--
        Just like the Indian summer:
    And ere the snows of age descend,
    O trust me, dear one, changeless friend,
    Our falling years may brightly end--
        Just like the Indian summer.

JULY 7, 1839.

WINTHROP MACKWORTH PRAED.--1802-1839.

    Dearest, I did not dream, four years ago,
      When through your veil I saw your bright tear shine,
    Caught your clear whisper, exquisitely low,
      And felt your soft hand tremble into mine,

    That in so brief--so very brief a space,
      He, who in love both clouds and cheers our life,
    Would lay on you, so full of light, joy, grace,
      The darker, sadder duties of the wife,--
    Doubts, fears, and frequent toil, and constant care
      For this poor frame, by sickness sore bested;
    The daily tendance on the fractious chair,
      The nightly vigil by the feverish bed.

    Yet not unwelcom'd doth this morn arise,
      Though with more gladsome beams it might have shone:
    Strength of these weak hands, light of these dim eyes,
      In sickness, as in health,--bless you, My Own!

LI. HORATIUS.[L]

A LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.

LORD MACAULAY.--1800-1859.

    Lars Porsena of Clusium by the Nine Gods he swore
    That the great house of Tarquin should suffer wrong no more.
    By the Nine Gods he swore it, and named a trysting day,
    And bade his messengers ride forth, east and west and south
              and north,
      To summon his array.

    East and west and south and north the messengers ride fast,
    And tower and town and cottage have heard the trumpet's blast.
    Shame on the false Etruscan who lingers in his home,
    When Porsena of Clusium is on the march for Rome.

    The horsemen and the footmen are pouring in amain
    From many a stately market-place; from many a fruitful plain;
    From many a lonely hamlet, which, hid by beech and pine,
    Like an eagle's nest, hangs on the crest of purple Apennine;
    From lordly Volaterræ, where scowls the far-famed hold
    Piled by the hands of giants for godlike kings of old;
    From seagirt Populonia, whose sentinels descry
    Sardinia's snowy mountain-tops fringing the southern sky;
    From the proud mart of Pisæ, queen of the western waves,
    Where ride Massilia's triremes heavy with fair-hair'd slaves;
    From where sweet Clanis wanders through corn and vines and
              flowers;
    From where Cortona lifts to heaven her diadem of towers.

    Tall are the oaks whose acorns drop in dark Auser's rill;
    Fat are the stags that champ the boughs of the Ciminian hill;
    Beyond all streams Clitumnus is to the herdsman dear;
    Best of all pools the fowler loves the great Volsinian mere.
    But now no stroke of woodman is heard by Auser's rill;
    No hunter tracks the stag's green path up the Ciminian hill;
    Unwatch'd along Clitumnus grazes the milk-white steer;
    Unharm'd the waterfowl may dip in the Volsinian mere.
    The harvests of Arretium, this year, old men shall reap;
    This year, young boys in Umbro shall plunge the struggling sheep;
    And in the vats of Luna, this year, the must shall foam
    Round the white feet of laughing girls whose sires have march'd
              to Rome.

    There be thirty chosen prophets, the wisest of the land,
    Who alway by Lars Porsena both morn and evening stand:
    Evening and morn the Thirty have turn'd the verses o'er,
    Traced from the right on linen white by mighty seers of yore.
    And with one voice the Thirty have their glad answer given:
    "Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena; go forth, belov'd of heaven.
    Go, and return in glory to Clusium's royal dome;
    And hang round Nurscia's altars the golden shields of Rome."

    And now hath every city sent up her tale of men:
    The foot are fourscore thousand, the horse are thousands ten.
    Before the gates of Sutrium is met the great array.
    A proud man was Lars Porsena upon the trysting day.
    For all the Etruscan armies were ranged beneath his eye,
    And many a banish'd Roman, and many a stout ally;
    And with a mighty following to join the muster came
    The Tusculan Mamilius, prince of the Latian name.

    But by the yellow Tiber was tumult and affright:
    From all the spacious champaign to Rome men took their flight.
    A mile around the city, the throng stopp'd up the ways;
    A fearful sight it was to see through two long nights and days.
    For aged folks on crutches, and women great with child,
    And mothers sobbing over babes that clung to them and smiled,
    And sick men borne in litters high on the necks of slaves,
    And troops of sun-burn'd husbandmen with reaping-hooks and staves,
    And droves of mules and asses laden with skins of wine,
    And endless flocks of goats and sheep, and endless herds of kine,
    And endless trains of wagons that creak'd beneath the weight
    Of corn-sacks and of household goods, choked every roaring gate.

    Now, from the rock Tarpeian, could the wan burghers spy
    The line of blazing villages red in the midnight sky.
    The Fathers of the City, they sat all night and day,
    For every hour some horseman came with tidings of dismay.
    To eastward and to westward have spread the Tuscan bands;
    Nor house, nor fence, nor dovecote in Crustumerium stands.
    Verbenna down to Ostia hath wasted all the plain;
    Astur hath storm'd Janiculum, and the stout guards are slain.
    I wis, in all the Senate, there was no heart so bold,
    But sore it ached, and fast it beat, when that ill news was told.
    Forthwith up rose the Consul, up rose the Fathers all;
    In haste they girded up their gowns, and hied them to the wall.
    They held a council standing, before the River-Gate;
    Short time was there, ye well may guess, for musing or debate.
    Out spake the Consul roundly: "The bridge must straight go down;
    For, since Janiculum is lost, nought else can save the town."

    Just then a scout came flying, all wild with haste and fear:
    "To arms! to arms! Sir Consul: Lars Porsena is here."
    On the low hills to westward the Consul fix'd his eye,
    And saw the swarthy storm of dust rise fast along the sky.
    And nearer fast and nearer doth the red whirlwind come;
    And louder still and still more loud, from underneath that rolling
              cloud,
    Is heard the trumpet's war-note proud, the trampling, and the hum.
    And plainly and more plainly now through the gloom appears,
    Far to left and far to right, in broken gleams of dark-blue light,
    The long array of helmets bright, the long array of spears.
    And plainly and more plainly above that glimmering line,
    Now might ye see the banners of twelve fair cities shine;
    But the banner of proud Clusium was highest of them all,
    The terror of the Umbrian, the terror of the Gaul.
    And plainly and more plainly now might the burghers know,
    By port and vest, by horse and crest, each warlike Lucumo.
    There Cilnius of Arretium on his fleet roan was seen;
    And Astur of the four-fold shield, girt with the brand none else
              may wield,
    Tolumnius with the belt of gold, and dark Verbenna from the hold
      By reedy Thrasymene.

    Fast by the royal standard, o'erlooking all the war,
    Lars Porsena of Clusium sat in his ivory car.
    By the right wheel rode Mamilius, prince of the Latian name;
    And by the left false Sextus, that wrought the deed of shame.
    But when the face of Sextus was seen among the foes,
    A yell that rent the firmament from all the town arose.
    On the house-tops was no woman but spat towards him and hiss'd,
    No child but scream'd out curses, and shook its little fist.
    But the Consul's brow was sad, and the Consul's speech was low,
    And darkly look'd he at the wall, and darkly at the foe.
    "Their van will be upon us before the bridge goes down;
    And if they once may win the bridge, what hope to save the town?"

    Then out spake brave Horatius, the Captain of the Gate:
    "To every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late.
    And how can man die better than facing fearful odds,
    For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods,
    And for the tender mother who dandled him to rest,
    And for the wife who nurses his baby at her breast,
    And for the holy maidens who feed the eternal flame,
    To save them from false Sextus that wrought the deed of shame?
    Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, with all the speed ye may;
    I, with two more to help me, will hold the foe in play.
    In yon strait path a thousand may well be stopp'd by three.
    Now who will stand on either hand, and keep the bridge with me?"

    Then out spake Spurius Lartius; a Ramnian proud was he:
    "Lo, I will stand at thy right hand, and keep the bridge with thee."
    And out spake strong Herminius; of Titian blood was he:
    "I will abide on thy left side, and keep the bridge with thee."

    "Horatius," quoth the Consul, "as thou sayest, so let it be."
    And straight against that great array forth went the dauntless
              Three.
    For Romans in Rome's quarrel spared neither land nor gold,
    Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life, in the brave days of old.
    Then none was for a party; then all were for the state;
    Then the great man help'd the poor, and the poor man lov'd
              the great:
    Then lands were fairly portion'd; then spoils were fairly sold:
    The Romans were like brothers in the brave days of old.
    Now Roman is to Roman more hateful than a foe,
    And the Tribunes beard the high, and the Fathers grind the low.
    As we wax hot in faction, in battle we wax cold:
    Wherefore men fight not as they fought in the brave days of old.

    Now while the Three were tightening their harness on their backs,
    The Consul was the foremost man to take in hand an axe:
    And Fathers mix'd with Commons seized hatchet, bar, and crow,
    And smote upon the planks above, and loosed the props below.

    Meanwhile the Tuscan army, right glorious to behold,
    Came flashing back the noonday light, rank behind rank, like
              surges bright
        Of a broad sea of gold.
    Four hundred trumpets sounded a peal of warlike glee,
    As that great host, with measured tread, and spears advanced,
              and ensigns spread,
    Roll'd slowly towards the bridge's head, where stood the dauntless
              Three.

    The Three stood calm and silent, and look'd upon the foes,
    And a great shout of laughter from all the vanguard rose:
    And forth three chiefs came spurring before that deep array;
    To earth they sprang, their swords they drew, and lifted high their
              shields, and flew
      To win the narrow way;
    Aunus from green Tifernum, lord of the Hill of Vines;
    And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves sicken in Ilva's mines;
    And Picus, long to Clusium vassal in peace and war,
    Who led to fight his Umbrian powers from that gray crag where,
              girt with towers,
    The fortress of Nequinum lowers o'er the pale waves of Nar.

    Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus into the stream beneath:
    Herminius struck at Seius, and clove him to the teeth:
    At Picus brave Horatius darted one fiery thrust;
    And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms clash'd in the bloody dust.

    Then Ocnus of Falerii rush'd on the Roman Three;
    And Lausulus of Urgo, the rover of the sea;
    And Aruns of Volsinium, who slew the great wild boar,
    The great wild boar that had his den amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,
    And wasted fields, and slaughter'd men, along Albinia's shore.

    Herminius smote down Aruns: Lartius laid Ocnus low:
    Right to the heart of Lausulus Horatius sent a blow.
    "Lie there," he cried, "fell pirate! no more, aghast and pale,
    From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark the track of thy destroying
              bark.
    No more Campania's hinds shall fly to woods and caverns when
              they spy.
      Thy thrice accursèd sail."

    But now no sound of laughter was heard among the foes.
    A wild and wrathful clamor from all the vanguard rose.
    Six spears' lengths from the entrance halted that deep array,
    And for a space no man came forth to win the narrow way.

    But hark! the cry is Astur: and lo! the ranks divide;
    And the great Lord of Luna comes with his stately stride.
    Upon his ample shoulders clangs loud the four-fold shield,
    And in his hand he shakes the brand which none but he can wield.

    He smiled on those bold Romans a smile serene and high;
    He eyed the flinching Tuscans, and scorn was in his eye.
    Quoth he, "The she-wolf's litter stand savagely at bay:
    But will ye dare to follow, if Astur clears the way?"
    Then, whirling up his broadsword with both hands to the height,
    He rush'd against Horatius, and smote with all his might.
    With shield and blade Horatius right deftly turn'd the blow.
    The blow, though turn'd, came yet too nigh; it miss'd his helm,
              but gash'd his thigh:
    The Tuscans raised a joyful cry to see the red blood flow.
    He reel'd, and on Herminius he lean'd one breathing-space;
    Then, like a wild-cat mad with wounds, sprang right at Astur's face.
    Through teeth, and skull, and helmet, so fierce a thrust he sped,
    The good sword stood a hand-breadth out behind the Tuscan's head.
    And the great Lord of Luna fell at that deadly stroke,
    As falls on Mount Alvernus a thunder-smitten oak.
    Far o'er the crashing forest the giant arms lie spread;
    And the pale augurs, muttering low, gaze on the blasted head.
    On Astur's throat Horatius right firmly press'd his heel,
    And thrice and four times tugg'd amain, ere he wrench'd out the
              steel.
    "And see," he cried, "the welcome, fair guests, that waits you here!
    What noble Lucumo comes next to taste our Roman cheer?"

    But at his haughty challenge a sullen murmur ran,
    Mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread, along that glittering van.
    There lack'd not men of prowess, nor men of lordly race;
    For all Etruria's noblest were round the fatal place.
    But all Etruria's noblest felt their hearts sink to see
    On the earth the bloody corpses, in the path the dauntless Three:
    And, from the ghastly entrance where those bold Romans stood,
    All shrank, like boys who unaware, ranging the woods to start a hare,
    Come to the mouth of the dark lair where, growling low, a fierce old
              bear
      Lies amidst bones and blood.
    Was none who would be foremost to lead such dire attack:
    But those behind cried "Forward!" and those before cried "Back!"
    And backward now and forward wavers the deep array;
    And on the tossing sea of steel, to and fro the standards reel;
    And the victorious trumpet-peal dies fitfully away.

    Yet one man for one moment stood out before the crowd;
    Well known was he to all the Three, and they gave him greeting loud.
    "Now welcome, welcome, Sextus! now welcome to thy home!
    Why dost thou stay, and turn away? here lies the road to Rome."
    Thrice look'd he at the city; thrice look'd he at the dead;
    And thrice came on in fury, and thrice turn'd back in dread;
    And, white with fear and hatred, scowl'd at the narrow way
    Where, wallowing in a pool of blood, the bravest Tuscans lay.

    But meanwhile axe and lever have manfully been plied;
    And now the bridge hangs tottering above the boiling tide.
    "Come back, come back, Horatius!" loud cried the Fathers all.
    "Back, Lartius! back, Herminius! back, ere the ruin fall!"
    Back darted Spurius Lartius; Herminius darted back:
    And, as they pass'd, beneath their feet they felt the timbers crack.
    But when they turn'd their faces, and on the farther shore
    Saw brave Horatius stand alone, they would have cross'd once more.
    But with a crash like thunder fell every loosen'd beam,
    And, like a dam, the mighty wreck lay right athwart the stream:
    And a long shout of triumph rose from the walls of Rome,
    As to the highest turret-tops was splash'd the yellow foam.
    And, like a horse unbroken when first he feels the rein,
    The furious river struggled hard, and toss'd his tawny mane,
    And burst the curb, and bounded, rejoicing to be free,
    And whirling down, in fierce career, battlement, and plank, and
              pier,
      Rush'd headlong to the sea.

    Alone stood brave Horatius, but constant still in mind;
    Thrice thirty thousand foes before, and the broad flood behind.
    "Down with him!" cried false Sextus, with a smile on his pale face.
    "Now yield thee," cried Lars Porsena, "now yield thee to our grace."
    Round turn'd he, as not deigning those craven ranks to see;
    Nought spake he to Lars Porsena, to Sextus nought spake he;
    But he saw on Palatinus the white porch of his home;
    And he spake to the noble river that rolls by the towers of Rome.
    So he spake, and speaking sheathed the good sword by his side,
    And with his harness on his back plunged headlong in the tide.

    No sound of joy or sorrow was heard from either bank;
    But friends and foes in dumb surprise, with parted lips and
              straining eyes,
      Stood gazing where he sank;
    And when above the surges they saw his crest appear,
    All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry, and even the ranks of Tuscany
      Could scarce forbear to cheer.
    But fiercely ran the current, swollen high by months of rain:
    And fast his blood was flowing, and he was sore in pain,
    And heavy with his armor, and spent with changing blows:
    And oft they thought him sinking, but still again he rose.
    Never, I ween, did swimmer, in such an evil case,
    Struggle through such a raging flood safe to the landing-place:
    But his limbs were borne up bravely by the brave heart within,
    And our good father Tiber bare bravely up his chin.

    "Curse on him!" quoth false Sextus; "will not the villain drown?
    But for this stay, ere close of day we should have sack'd the town!"
    "Heaven help him!" quoth Lars Porsena, "and bring him safe to shore;
    For such a gallant feat of arms was never seen before."
    And now he feels the bottom; now on dry earth he stands;
    Now round him throng the Fathers to press his gory hands;
    And now, with shouts and clapping, and noise of weeping loud,
    He enters through the River-Gate, borne by the joyous crowd.

    They gave him of the corn-land, that was of public right,
    As much as two strong oxen could plough from morn till night;
    And they made a molten image, and set it up on high,
    And there it stands unto this day to witness if I lie.
    It stands in the Comitium, plain for all folk to see;
    Horatius in his harness, halting upon one knee:
    And underneath is written, in letters all of gold,
    How valiantly he kept the bridge in the brave days of old.

    And still his name sounds stirring unto the men of Rome,
    As the trumpet-blast that cries to them to charge the Volscian home;
    And wives still pray to Juno for boys with hearts as bold
    As his who kept the bridge so well in the brave days of old.
    And in the nights of winter, when the cold north-winds blow,
    And the long howling of the wolves is heard amidst the snow;
    When round the lonely cottage roars loud the tempest's din,
    And the good logs of Algidus roar louder yet within;
    When the oldest cask is open'd, and the largest lamp is lit;
    When the chestnuts glow in the embers, and the kid turns on the
              spit;
    When young and old in circle around the firebrands close;
    When the girls are weaving baskets, and the lads are shaping bows;
    When the goodman mends his armor, and trims his helmet's plume;
    When the goodwife's shuttle merrily goes flashing through the loom;
    With weeping and with laughter still is the story told,
    How well Horatius kept the bridge in the brave days of old.

LII. THE RAVEN.

EDGAR ALLAN POE.--1809-1849.

    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I ponder'd, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,--
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber-door.
    "'Tis some visitor," I mutter'd, "tapping at my chamber-door,--
              Only this, and nothing more."

    Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wish'd the morrow: vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow,--sorrow for the lost Lenore;
    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,
              Nameless here forevermore.

    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
    Thrill'd me--fill'd me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
    "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber-door,--
    Some late visitor, entreating entrance at my chamber-door;
              This it is, and nothing more."

    Presently my soul grew stronger: hesitating then no longer,
    "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber-door,
    That I scarce was sure I heard you";--here I open'd wide the door;--
              Darkness there, and nothing more.

    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,
        fearing,
    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
    And the only word there spoken was the whisper'd word "Lenore?"
    This I whisper'd, and an echo murmur'd back the word "Lenore!"
              Merely this, and nothing more.

    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
    Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before.
    "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window-lattice;
    Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,--
    Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore:--
              'Tis the wind, and nothing more."

    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
    In there stepp'd a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
    Not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopp'd or stay'd he,
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perch'd above my chamber-door;
    Perch'd upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber-door;--
              Perch'd, and sat, and nothing more.

    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
    "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure
        no craven,
    Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the Nightly
        shore;--
    Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore."
              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

    Much I marvell'd this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
    Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;
    For we can not help agreeing that no living human being
    Ever yet was bless'd with seeing bird above his chamber-door,--
    Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber-door,
              With such name as "Nevermore."

    But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
    That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    Nothing further then he utter'd, not a feather then he flutter'd,
    Till I scarcely more than mutter'd, "Other friends have flown
        before:
    On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
              Then the bird said, "Nevermore."

    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
    "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
    Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster
    Follow'd fast, and follow'd faster, till his songs one burden
        bore,--
    Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore,
              Of--'Never--Nevermore.'"

    But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
    Straight I wheel'd a cushion'd seat in front of bird, and bust,
        and door;
    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
    What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore--
              Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
    To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burn'd into my bosom's core:
    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er;
    But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
              She shall press--ah! nevermore.

    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
    Swung by seraphim, whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
    "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath
        sent thee--
    Respite, respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
    Quaff, Oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"
              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

    "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!
    Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest toss'd thee here ashore,
    Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,
    On this home by Horror haunted,--tell me truly, I implore,
    Is there--is there balm in Gilead? tell me--tell me, I implore!"
    By that heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,
    Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore,--
    Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore."
              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

    "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shriek'd,
        upstarting,--
    "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
    Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my
        door!"
              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
    On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door;
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
    And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
        floor:
    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
              Shall be lifted--NEVERMORE!

LIII. DAVID SWAN--A FANTASY.

NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.--1804-1864.

From "TWICE-TOLD TALES."

We can be but partially acquainted even with the events which actually influence our course
through life, and our final destiny. There are innumerable other events, if such they may be
called, which come close upon us, yet pass away without actual results, or even betraying their
near approach by the reflection of any light or shadow across our minds. Could we know all
the vicissitudes of our fortunes, life would be too full of hope and fear, exultation or disappointment,
to afford us a single hour of true serenity. This idea may be illustrated by a page from the
secret history of David Swan.

We have nothing to do with David until we find him, at the age of twenty, on the high road
from his native place to the city of Boston, where his uncle, a small dealer in the grocery
line, was to take him behind the counter. Be it enough to say, that he was a native of New
Hampshire, born of respectable parents, and had received an ordinary school education, with
a classic finish by a year at Gilmanton Academy. After journeying on foot from sunrise till
nearly noon of a summer's day, his weariness and the increasing heat determined him to sit
down in the first convenient shade, and await the coming up of the stage-coach. As if planted
on purpose for him, there soon appeared a little tuft of maples, with a delightful recess in
the midst, and such a fresh bubbling spring, that it seemed never to have sparkled for any
wayfarer but David Swan. Virgin or not, he kissed it with his thirsty lips, and then flung
himself along the brink, pillowing his head upon some shirts and a pair of pantaloons, tied
up in a striped cotton handkerchief. The sunbeams could not reach him; the dust did not yet
rise from the road, after the heavy rain of yesterday; and his grassy lair suited the young
man better than a bed of down. The spring murmured drowsily beside him; the branches waved
dreamily across the blue sky overhead; and a deep sleep, perchance hiding dreams within its
depths, fell upon David Swan. But we are to relate events which he did not dream of.

While he lay sound asleep in the shade, other people were wide-awake, and passed to an fro,
afoot, on horseback, and in all sorts of vehicles, along the sunny road by his bed-chamber.
Some looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, and knew not that he was there; some
merely glanced that way, without admitting the slumberer among their busy thoughts; some laughed
to see how soundly he slept; and several, whose hearts were brimming full of scorn, ejected
their venomous superfluity upon David Swan. A middle-aged widow, when nobody else was near,
thrust her head a little way into the recess, and vowed that the young fellow looked charming
in his sleep. A temperance lecturer saw him, and wrought poor David into the texture of his
evening's discourse, as an awful instance of dead-drunkenness by the road-side. But censure,
praise, merriment, scorn, and indifference, were all one, or rather all nothing, to David Swan.

He had slept only a few moments when a brown carriage, drawn by a handsome pair of horses,
bowled easily along, and was brought to a stand-still nearly in front of David's resting-place.
A linch-pin had fallen out, and permitted one of the wheels to slide off. The damage was slight,
and occasioned merely a momentary alarm to an elderly merchant and his wife, who were returning
to Boston in the carriage. While the coachman and a servant were replacing the wheel, the lady
and gentleman sheltered themselves beneath the maple-trees, and there espied the bubbling fountain,
and David Swan asleep beside it. Impressed with the awe which the humblest sleeper usually
sheds around him, the merchant trod as lightly as the gout would allow; and his spouse took
good heed not to rustle her silk gown, lest David should start up, all of a sudden.

"How soundly he sleeps!" whispered the old gentleman. "From what a depth he draws that easy
breath! Such sleep as that, brought on without an opiate, would be worth more to me than half
my income, for it would suppose health and an untroubled mind."

"And youth besides," said the lady. "Healthy and quiet age does not sleep thus. Our slumber
is no more like his than our wakefulness."

The longer they looked, the more did this elderly couple feel interested in the unknown youth,
to whom the wayside and the maple shade were as a secret chamber, with the rich gloom of damask
curtains brooding over him. Perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon his face, the
lady contrived to twist a branch aside, so as to intercept it. And having done this little
act of kindness, she began to feel like a mother to him.

"Providence seems to have laid him here," whispered she to her husband, "and to have brought
us hither to find him, after our disappointment in our cousin's son. Methinks I can see a likeness
to our departed Henry. Shall we waken him?"

"To what purpose?" said the merchant, hesitating. "We know nothing of the youth's character."

"That open countenance!" replied his wife, in the same hushed voice, yet earnestly. "This innocent
sleep!"

While these whispers were passing, the sleeper's heart did not throb, nor his breath become
agitated, nor his features betray the least token of interest. Yet Fortune was bending over
him, just ready to let fall a burthen of gold. The old merchant had lost his only son, and
had no heir to his wealth, except a distant relative, with whose conduct he was dissatisfied.
In such cases, people sometimes do stranger things than to act the magician, and awaken a young
man to splendor, who fell asleep in poverty.

"Shall we not waken him?" repeated the lady, persuasively.

"The coach is ready, sir," said the servant, behind.

The old couple started, reddened, and hurried away, mutually wondering that they should ever
have dreamed of doing anything so very ridiculous. The merchant threw himself back in the carriage,
and occupied his mind with the plan of a magnificent asylum for unfortunate men of business.
Meanwhile, David Swan enjoyed his nap.

The carriage could not have gone above a mile or two, when a pretty young girl came along with
a tripping pace, which showed precisely how her little heart was dancing in her bosom. Perhaps
it was this merry kind of motion that caused--is there any harm in saying it?--her garter to
slip its knot. Conscious that the silken girth, if silk it were, was relaxing its hold, she
turned aside into the shelter of the maple-trees, and there found a young man asleep by the
spring! Blushing as red as any rose, that she should have intruded into a gentleman's bed-chamber,
and for such a purpose, too, she was about to make her escape on tiptoe. But there was peril
near the sleeper. A monster of a bee had been wandering overhead--buzz, buzz, buzz--now among
the leaves, now flashing through the strips of sunshine, and now lost in the dark shade, till
finally he appeared to be settling on the eyelid of David Swan. The sting of a bee is sometimes
deadly. As free-hearted as she was innocent, the girl attacked the intruder with her handkerchief,
brushed him soundly, and drove him from the maple shade. How sweet a picture! This good deed
accomplished, with quickened breath, and a deeper blush, she stole a glance at the youthful
stranger, for whom she had been battling with a dragon in the air.

"He is handsome!" thought she, and blushed redder yet.

How could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong within him, that, shattered by its very
strength, it should part asunder, and allow him to perceive the girl among its phantoms? Why,
at least, did no smile of welcome brighten upon his face? She was come, the maid whose soul,
according to the old and beautiful idea, had been severed from his own, and whom, in all his
vague but passionate desires, he yearned to meet. Her only could he love with a perfect love--him
only could she receive into the depths of her heart--and now her image was faintly blushing
in the fountain by his side; should it pass away, its happy lustre would never gleam upon his
life again.

"How sound he sleeps!" murmured the girl.

She departed, but did not trip along the road so lightly as when she came.

Now, this girl's father was a thriving country merchant in the neighborhood, and happened,
at that identical time, to be looking out for just such a young man as David Swan. Had David
formed a wayside acquaintance with the daughter, he would have become the father's clerk, and
all else in natural succession. So here, again, had good fortune--the best of fortunes--stolen
so near, that her garments brushed against him; and he knew nothing of the matter.

The girl was hardly out of sight, when two men turned aside beneath the maple shade. Both had
dark faces, set off by cloth caps, which were drawn down aslant over their brows. Their dresses
were shabby, yet had a certain smartness. These were a couple of rascals, who got their living
by whatever the devil sent them, and now, in the interim of other business, had staked the
joint profits of their next piece of villainy on a game of cards, which was to have been decided
here under the trees. But, finding David asleep by the spring, one of the rogues whispered
to his fellow--

"Hist!--Do you see that bundle under his head?"

The other villain nodded, winked, and leered.

"I'll bet you a horn of brandy," said the first, "that the chap has either a pocket-book or
a snug little hoard of small change, stowed away amongst his shirts. And if not there, we shall
find it in his pantaloons' pocket."

"But how if he wakes?" said the other.

His companion thrust aside his waistcoat, pointed to the handle of a dirk, and nodded.

"So be it!" muttered the second villain.

They approached the unconscious David, and, while one pointed the dagger towards his heart,
the other began to search the bundle beneath his head. Their two faces, grim, wrinkled, and
ghastly with guilt and fear, bent over their victim, looking horribly enough to be mistaken
for fiends, should he suddenly awake. Nay, had the villains glanced aside into the spring,
even they would hardly have known themselves, as reflected there. But David Swan had never
worn a more tranquil aspect, even when asleep on his mother's breast.

"I must take away the bundle," whispered one.

"If he stirs, I'll strike," muttered the other.

But, at this moment, a dog, scenting along the ground, came in beneath the maple-trees, and
gazed alternately at each of these wicked men, and then at the quiet sleeper. He then lapped
out of the fountain.

"Pshaw!" said one villain. "We can do nothing now. The dog's master must be close behind."

"Let's take a drink, and be off," said the other.

The man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into his bosom, and drew forth a pocket-pistol,
but not of that kind which kills by a single discharge. It was a flask of liquor, with a block-tin
tumbler screwed upon the mouth. Each drank a comfortable dram, and left the spot, with so many
jests, and such laughter at their unaccomplished wickedness, that they might be said to have
gone on their way rejoicing. In a few hours they had forgotten the whole affair, nor once imagined
that the recording angel had written down the crime of murder against their souls, in letters
as durable as eternity. As for David Swan, he still slept quietly, neither conscious of the
shadow of death when it hung over him, nor of the glow of renewed life when that shadow was
withdrawn.

He slept, but no longer so quietly as at first. An hour's repose had snatched from his elastic
frame the weariness with which many hours of toil had burthened it. Now he stirred--now moved
his lips, without a sound--now talked in an inward tone to the noonday spectres of his dream.
But a noise of wheels came rattling louder and louder along the road, until it dashed through
the dispersing mist of David's slumber--and there was the stage-coach. He started up, with
all his ideas about him.

"Hallo, driver! Take a passenger?" shouted he.

"Room on top!" answered the driver.

Up mounted David, and bowled away merrily towards Boston, without so much as a parting glance
at that fountain of dreamlike vicissitude. He knew not that a phantom of Wealth had thrown
a golden hue upon its waters, nor that one of Love had sighed softly to their murmur, nor that
one of Death had threatened to crimson them with his blood--all, in the brief hour since he
lay down to sleep. Sleeping or waking, we hear not the airy footsteps of the strange things
that almost happen. Does it not argue a superintending Providence, that, while viewless and
unexpected events thrust themselves continually athwart our path, there should still be regularity
enough in mortal life, to render foresight even partially available?

LIV. MY KATE.

ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.--1809-1861.

    She was not as pretty as women I know,
    And yet all your best made of sunshine and snow
    Drop to shade, melt to nought in the long-trodden ways,
    While she's still remember'd on warm and cold days--
              My Kate.

    Her air had a meaning, her movements a grace;
    You turn'd from the fairest to gaze on her face:
    And when you had once seen her forehead and mouth,
    You saw as distinctly her soul and her truth--
              My Kate.

    Such a blue inner light from her eyelids outbroke,
    You look'd at her silence and fancied she spoke:
    When she did, so peculiar yet soft was the tone,
    Though the loudest spoke also, you heard her alone--
              My Kate.

    I doubt if she said to you much that could act
    As a thought or suggestion: she did not attract
    In the sense of the brilliant or wise: I infer
    'Twas her thinking of others, made you think of her--
              My Kate.

    She never found fault with you, never implied
    Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side
    Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town
    The children were gladder that pull'd at her gown--
              My Kate.

    None knelt at her feet confess'd lovers in thrall;
    They knelt more to God than they used,--that was all;
    If you praised her as charming, some ask'd what you meant,
    But the charm of her presence was felt when she went--
              My Kate.

    The weak and the gentle, the ribald and rude,
    She took as she found them, and did them all good:
    It always was so with her: see what you have!
    She has made the grass greener even here ... with her grave--
              My Kate.

    My dear one!--when thou wast alive with the rest,
    I held thee the sweetest and lov'd thee the best:
    And now thou art dead, shall I not take thy part
    As thy smiles used to do for thyself, my sweet Heart--
              My Kate?

LV. A DEAD ROSE.

MRS. BROWNING.

        O Rose, who dares to name thee?
    No longer roseate now, nor soft nor sweet,
    But pale and hard and dry as stubble wheat,--
      Kept seven years in a drawer, thy titles shame thee.

        The breeze that used to blow thee
    Between the hedgerow thorns, and take away
    An odor up the lane to last all day,--
      If breathing now, unsweeten'd would forego thee.

        The sun that used to smite thee,
    And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn
    Till beam appear'd to bloom, and flower to burn,--
      If shining now, with not a hue would light thee.

        The dew that used to wet thee,
    And, white first, grow incarnadined because
    It lay upon thee where the crimson was,--
      If dropping now, would darken where it met thee.

        The fly that 'lit upon thee
    To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet
    Along thy leafs pure edges after heat,--
      If 'lighting now, would coldly overrun thee.

        The bee that once did suck thee,
    And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,
    And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,--
      If passing now, would blindly overlook thee.

        The heart doth recognize thee,
    Alone, alone! the heart doth smell thee sweet,
    Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete,
      Perceiving all those changes that disguise thee.

        Yes, and the heart doth owe thee
    More love, dead rose, than to any roses bold
    Which Julia wears at dances, smiling cold:--
      Lie still upon this heart which breaks below thee!

LVI. TO THE EVENING WIND.

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.--1794-1878.

    Spirit that breathest through my lattice, thou
      That cool'st the twilight of the sultry day,
    Gratefully flows thy freshness round my brow;
      Thou hast been out upon the deep at play,
    Riding all day the wild blue waves till now,
      Roughening their crests, and scattering high their spray,
    And swelling the white sail. I welcome thee
    To the scorch'd land, thou wanderer of the sea.

    Nor I alone;--a thousand bosoms round
      Inhale thee in the fulness of delight;
    And languid forms rise up, and pulses bound
      Livelier at coming of the wind of night;
    And languishing to hear thy grateful sound,
      Lies the vast inland stretch'd beyond the sight.
    Go forth into the gathering shade; go forth,
    God's blessing breathed upon the fainting earth!

    Go, rock the little wood-bird in his nest,
      Curl the still waters, bright with stars, and rouse
    The wide old wood from his majestic rest,
      Summoning from the innumerable boughs
    The strange deep harmonies that haunt his breast;
      Pleasant shall be thy way where meekly bows
    The shutting flower, and darkling waters pass,
    And where the o'er-shadowing branches sweep the grass.

    The faint old man shall lean his silver head
      To feel thee; thou shalt kiss the child asleep,
    And dry the moisten'd curls that overspread
      His temples, while his breathing grows more deep;
    And they who stand about the sick man's bed
      Shall joy to listen to thy distant sweep,
    And softly part his curtains to allow
    Thy visit, grateful to his burning brow.

    Go,--but the circle of eternal change,
      Which is the life of nature, shall restore,
    With sounds and scents from all thy mighty range,
      Thee to thy birthplace of the deep once more;
    Sweet odors in the sea-air, sweet and strange,
      Shall tell the homesick mariner of the shore;
    And, listening to thy murmur, he shall dream
    He hears the rustling leaf and running stream.

LVII.--DEATH OF THE PROTECTOR.[M]

THOMAS CARLYLE.--1795-1881.

From OLIVER CROMWELL'S LETTERS AND SPEECHES.

And so we have now nothing more;--and Oliver has nothing more. His Speakings, and also his
Actings, all his manifold Strugglings, more or less victorious, to utter the great God's-Message
that was in him,--have here what we call ended. This Summer of 1658, likewise victorious after
struggle, is his last in our World of Time. Thenceforth he enters the Eternities; and rests
upon his arms there.

Oliver's look was yet strong; and young for his years, which were Fifty-nine last April. The
"Three-score and ten years," the Psalmist's limit, which probably was often in Oliver's thoughts
and in those of others there, might have been anticipated for him: Ten Years more of Life;--which,
we may compute, would have given another History to all the Centuries of England. But it was
not to be so, it was to be otherwise. Oliver's health, as we might observe, was but uncertain
in late times; often "indisposed" the spring before last. His course of life had not been favorable
to health! "A burden too heavy for man!" as he himself, with a sigh, would sometimes say. Incessant
toil; inconceivable labor, of head and heart and hand; toil, peril, and sorrow manifold, continued
for near Twenty years now, had done their part: those robust life-energies, it afterwards appeared,
had been gradually eaten out. Like a Tower strong to the eye, but with its foundations undermined;
which has not long to stand; the fall of which, on any shock, may be sudden.--

The Manzinis and Ducs de Crequi, with their splendors, and congratulations about Dunkirk, interesting
to the street-populations and general public, had not yet withdrawn, when at Hampton Court
there had begun a private scene, of much deeper and quite opposite interest there. The Lady
Claypole, Oliver's favorite Daughter, a favorite of all the world, had fallen sick we know
not when; lay sick now,--to death, as it proved. Her disease was of a nature, the painfullest
and most harassing to mind and sense, it is understood, that falls to the lot of a human creature.
Hampton Court we can fancy once more, in those July days, a house of sorrow; pale Death knocking
there, as at the door of the meanest hut. "She had great sufferings, great exercises of spirit."
Yes:--and in the depths of the old Centuries, we see a pale anxious Mother, anxious Husband,
anxious weeping Sisters, a poor young Frances weeping anew in her weeds. "For the last fourteen
days" his Highness had been by her bedside at Hampton Court, unable to attend to any public
business whatever. Be still, my Child; trust thou yet in God: in the waves of the Dark River,
there too is He a God of help!--On the 6th day of August she lay dead; at rest forever. My
young, my beautiful, my brave! She is taken from me; I am left bereaved of her. The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the Name of the Lord!--...

In the same dark days, occurred George Fox's third and last interview with Oliver.--.... George
dates nothing; and his facts everywhere lie round him like the leather-parings of his old shop:
but we judge it may have been about the time when the Manzinis and the Ducs de Crequi were
parading in their gilt coaches, That George and two Friends "going out of Town," on a summer
day, "two of Hacker's men" had met them,--taken them, brought them to the Mews. "Prisoners
there awhile:"--but the Lord's power was over Hacker's men; they had to let us go. Whereupon:

"The same day, taking boat I went down" (up) "to Kingston, and from thence to Hampton Court,
to speak with the Protector about the Sufferings of Friends. I met him riding into Hampton-Court
Park; and before I came to him, as he rode at the head of his Lifeguard, I saw and felt a waft"
(whiff) "of death go forth against him."----Or in favor of him, George? His life, if thou knew
it, has not been a merry thing for this man, now or heretofore! I fancy he has been looking,
this long while, to give it up, whenever the Commander-in-Chief required. To quit his laborious
sentry-post; honorably lay-up his arms, and be gone to his rest:--all Eternity to rest in,
O George! Was thy own life merry, for example, in the hollow of the tree; clad permanently
in leather? And does kingly purple, and governing refractory worlds instead of stitching coarse
shoes, make it merrier? The waft of death is not against him, I think,--perhaps against thee,
and me, and others, O George, when the Nell-Gwynn Defender and Two Centuries of all-victorious
Cant have come in upon us! My unfortunate George----"a waft of death go forth against him;
and when I came to him, he looked like a dead man. After I had laid the Sufferings of Friends
before him, and had warned him according as I was moved to speak to him, he bade me come to
his house. So I returned to Kingston; and, the next day, went up to Hampton Court to speak
farther with him. But when I came, Harvey, who was one that waited on him, told me the Doctors
were not willing that I should speak with him. So I passed away, and never saw him more."

Friday the 20th of August 1658, this was probably the day on which George Fox saw Oliver riding
into Hampton Park with his Guards, for the last time. That Friday, as we find, his Highness
seemed much better: but on the morrow a sad change had taken place; feverish symptoms, for
which the Doctors rigorously prescribed quiet. Saturday to Tuesday the symptoms continued ever
worsening: a kind of tertian ague, "bastard tertian" as the old Doctors name it; for which
it was ordered that his Highness should return to Whitehall, as to a more favorable air in
that complaint. On Tuesday accordingly he quitted Hampton Court;--never to see it more.

"His time was come," says Harvey; "and neither prayers nor tears could prevail with God to
lengthen out his life and continue him longer to us. Prayers abundantly and incessantly poured
out on his behalf, both publicly and privately, as was observed, in a more than ordinary way.
Besides many a secret sigh,--secret and unheard by men, yet like the cry of Moses, more loud,
and strongly laying hold on God, than many spoken supplications. All which,--the hearts of
God's People being thus mightily stirred up,--did seem to beget confidence in some, and hopes
in all; yea some thoughts in himself, that God would restore him."

"Prayers public and private:" they are worth imagining to ourselves. Meetings of Preachers,
Chaplains, and Godly Persons; "Owen, Goodwin, Sterry, with a company of others, in an adjoining
room"; in Whitehall, and elsewhere over religious London and England, fervent outpourings of
many a loyal heart. For there were hearts to whom the nobleness of this man was known; and
his worth to the Puritan Cause was evident. Prayers,--strange enough to us; in a dialect fallen
obsolete, forgotten now. Authentic wrestlings of ancient Human Souls,--who were alive then,
with their affections, awestruck pieties; with their Human Wishes, risen to be transcendent,
hoping to prevail with the Inexorable. All swallowed now in the depths of dark Time; which
is full of such, since the beginning!--Truly it is a great scene of World-History, this in
old Whitehall: Oliver Cromwell drawing nigh to his end. The exit of Oliver Cromwell and of
English Puritanism; a great Light, one of our few authentic Solar Luminaries, going down now
amid the clouds of Death. Like the setting of a great victorious Summer Sun; its course now
finished. "So stirbt ein Held," says Schiller, "So dies a Hero! Sight worthy to be worshipped!"--He
died, this Hero Oliver, in Resignation to God; as the Brave have all done. "We could not be
more desirous he should abide," says the pious Harvey, "than he was content and willing to
be gone." The struggle lasted, amid hope and fear, for ten days....

On Monday August 30th, there roared and howled all day a mighty storm of wind.... It was on
this stormy Monday, while rocking winds, heard in the sickroom and everywhere, were piping
aloud, that Thurloe and an Official person entered to enquire, Who, in case of the worst, was
to be his Highness's Successor? The Successor is named in a sealed Paper already drawn-up,
above a year ago, at Hampton Court; now lying in such and such a place. The Paper was sent
for, searched for; it could never be found. Richard's is the name understood to have been written
in that Paper: not a good name; but in fact one does not know. In ten years' time, had ten
years more been granted, Richard might have become a fitter man; might have been cancelled,
if palpably unfit. Or perhaps it was Fleetwood's name,--and the Paper, by certain parties,
was stolen? None knows. On the Thursday night following, "and not till then," his Highness
is understood to have formally named "Richard",--or perhaps it might only be some heavy-laden
"Yes, yes!" spoken, out of the thick death-slumbers, in answer to Thurloe's question "Richard?"
The thing is a little uncertain. It was, once more, a matter of much moment;--giving color
probably to all the subsequent Centuries of England, this answer!--...

Thursday night the Writer of our old Pamphlet [Harvey] was himself in attendance on his Highness;
and has preserved a trait or two; with which let us hasten to conclude. Tomorrow is September
Third, always kept as a Thanksgiving day, since the Victories of Dunbar and Worcester. The
wearied one, "that very night before the Lord took him to his everlasting rest," was heard
thus, with oppressed voice, speaking:

"'Truly God is good; indeed He is; He will not'----Then his speech failed him, but as I apprehended,
it was, 'He will not leave me.' This saying, 'God is good,' he frequently used all along; and
would speak it with much cheerfulness, and fervor of spirit, in the midst of his pains.--Again
he said: 'I would be willing to live to be farther serviceable to God and His People: but my
work is done. Yet God will be with His People.'

"He was very restless most part of the night, speaking often to himself. And there being something
to drink offered him, he was desired To take the same, and endeavor to sleep.--Unto which he
answered: 'It is not my design to drink or sleep; but my design is, to make what haste I can
to be gone.'--

"Afterwards, towards morning, he used divers holy expressions, implying much inward consolation
and peace; among the rest he spake some exceeding self-debasing words, annihilating and judging
himself. And truly it was observed, that a public spirit to God's Cause did breathe in him,--as
in his lifetime, so now to his very last."

When the morrow's sun rose, Oliver was speechless; between three and four in the afternoon,
he lay dead. Friday 3rd September 1658. "The consternation and astonishment of all people,"
writes Fauconberg, "are inexpressible; their hearts seem as if sunk within them. My poor Wife,--I
know not what on earth to do with her. When seemingly quieted, she bursts out again into a
passion that tears her very heart in pieces."--Husht, poor weeping Mary! Here is a Life-battle
right nobly done. Seest thou not,

    "The storm is changed into a calm,
    At His command and will;
    So that the waves which raged before
    Now quiet are and still!

    "Then are they glad,--because at rest
    And quiet now they be:
    So to the haven He them brings
    Which they desired to see."

"Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord;" blessed are the valiant that have lived in the
Lord. "Amen, saith the Spirit,"--Amen. "They do rest from their labors, and their works follow
them."

"Their works follow them." As, I think, this Oliver Cromwell's works have done and are still
doing! We have had our "Revolutions of Eighty-eight," officially called "glorious"; and other
Revolutions not yet called glorious; and somewhat has been gained for poor Mankind. Men's ears
are not now slit-off by rash Officiality; Officiality will, for long henceforth, be more cautious
about men's ears. The tyrannous Star-chambers, branding-irons, chimerical Kings and Surplices
at All-hallowtide, they are gone, or with immense velocity going. Oliver's works do follow
him!--The works of a man, bury them under what guano-mountains and obscene owl-droppings you
will, do not perish, cannot perish. What of Heroism, what of Eternal Light was in a Man and
his Life, is with very great exactness added to the Eternities; remains forever a new divine
portion of the Sum of Things; and no owl's voice, this way or that, in the least avails in
the matter.--But we have to end here.

Oliver is gone; and with him England's Puritanism, laboriously built together by this man,
and made a thing far-shining, miraculous to its own Century, and memorable to all the Centuries,
soon goes. Puritanism, without its King, is kingless, anarchic; falls into dislocation, self-collision;
staggers, plunges into ever deeper anarchy; King, Defender of the Puritan Faith there can now
none be found;--and nothing is left but to recall the old disowned Defender with the remnants
of his Four Surplices, and Two Centuries of Hypocrisis (or Play-acting not so-called), and
put-up with all that, the best we may. The Genius of England no longer soars Sunward, world-defiant,
like an Eagle through the storms, "mewing her mighty youth," as John Milton saw her do: the
Genius of England, much liker a greedy Ostrich intent on provender and a whole skin mainly,
stands with its other extremity Sunward; with its Ostrich-head stuck into the readiest bush,
of old Church-tippets, King-cloaks, or what other "sheltering Fallacy" there may be, and so
awaits the issue. The issue has been slow; but it is now seen to have been inevitable. No Ostrich,
intent on gross terrene provender, and sticking its head into Fallacies, but will be awakened
one day,--in a terrible à-posteriori manner, if not otherwise!----Awake before it come to that;
gods and men bid us awake! The Voices of our Fathers, with thousand-fold stern monition to
one and all, bid us awake.

LVIII. EACH AND ALL.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON.--1803-1882.

    Little thinks, in the field, yon red-cloak'd clown
    Of thee from the hill-top looking down;
    The heifer that lows in the upland farm,
    Far-heard, lows not thine ear to charm;
    The sexton, tolling his bell at noon,
    Deems not that great Napoleon
    Stops his horse, and lists with delight,
    While his files sweep round yon Alpine height;
    Nor knowest thou what argument
    Thy life to thy neighbor's creed has lent.
    All are needed by each one--
    Nothing is fair or good alone.

    I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,
    Singing at dawn on the alder bough;
    I brought him home in his nest, at even,
    He sings the song, but it pleases not now;
    For I did not bring home the river and sky;
    He sang to my ear--they sang to my eye.

    The delicate shells lay on the shore;
    The bubbles of the latest wave
    Fresh pearls to their enamel gave,
    And the bellowing of the savage sea
    Greeted their safe escape to me.
    I wiped away the weeds and foam--
    I fetch'd my sea-born treasures home;
    But the poor unsightly, noisome things
    Had left their beauty on the shore,
    With the sun and the sand, and the wild uproar.

    The lover watch'd his graceful maid,
    As 'mid the virgin train she stray'd;
    Nor knew her beauty's best attire
    Was woven still by the snow-white choir.
    At last she came to his hermitage,
    Like the bird from the woodlands to the cage;
    The gay enchantment was undone--
    A gentle wife, but fairy none.

    Then I said, "I covet truth;
    Beauty is unripe childhoods cheat--
    I leave it behind with the games of youth."
    As I spoke, beneath my feet
    The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath,
    Running over the club-moss burrs;
    I inhaled the violet's breath;
    Around me stood the oaks and firs;
    Pine-cones and acorns lay on the ground;
    Over me soar'd the eternal sky,
    Full of light and of deity;
    Again I saw, again I heard,
    The rolling river, the morning bird;
    Beauty through my senses stole--
    I yielded myself to the perfect whole.

LIX. WATERLOO.

CHARLES JAMES LEVER.--1806-1872.

From CHARLES O'MALLEY.

"This is the officer that I spoke of," said an aid-de-camp, as he rode up to where I was standing,
bare-headed and without a sword. "He has just made his escape from the French lines, and will
be able to give your lordship some information."

The handsome features and gorgeous costume of Lord Uxbridge were known to me; but I was not
aware, till afterwards, that a soldierlike, resolute looking officer beside him, was General
Graham. It was the latter who first addressed me.

"Are you aware, Sir," said he, "if Grouchy's force is arrived?"

"They had not: on the contrary, shortly before I escaped, an aid-de-camp was despatched to
Gembloux, to hasten his coming. And the troops, for they must be troops, debouching from the
wood yonder--they seem to form a junction with the corps to the right--they are the Prussians.
They arrived there before noon from St. Lambert, and are part of Bülow's corps. Count Löbau
and his division of ten thousand men were despatched, about an hour since, to hold them in check."

"This is great news," said Lord Uxbridge. "Fitzroy must know it at once."

So saying he dashed spurs into his horse, and soon disappeared amid the crowd on the hill top.

"You had better see the Duke, Sir," said Graham: "your information is too important to be delayed.
Captain Calvert, let this officer have a horse; his own is too tired to go much further."

"And a cap, I beg of you," added I, in an under tone; "for I have already found a sabre."

By a slight circuitous route, we reached the road upon which a mass of dismounted artillery-carts,
baggage-wagons, and tumbrils, were heaped together as a barricade against the attack of the
French dragoons, who more than once had penetrated to the very crest of our position. Close
to this, and on a little rising ground, from which a view of the entire field extended from
Hougoumont to the far left, the Duke of Wellington stood, surrounded by his staff. His eye
was bent upon the valley before him, where the advancing columns of Ney's attack still pressed
onwards; while the fire of sixty great guns poured death and carnage into his lines. The second
Belgian division, routed and broken, had fallen back upon the twenty-seventh regiment, who
had merely time to throw themselves into square, when Milhaud's cuirassiers, armed with a terrible
long straight sword, came sweeping down upon them. A line of impassable bayonets, a living
chevaux-de-frise of the best blood of Britain, stood firm and motionless before the shock:
the French mitraille played mercilessly on the ranks; but the chasms were filled up like magic,
and in vain the bold horsemen of Gaul galloped round the bristling files. At length the word
"fire!" was heard within the square, and as the bullets at pistol range rattled upon them,
the cuirass afforded them no defence against the deadly volley. Men and horses rolled indiscriminately
upon the earth: then would come a charge of our dashing squadrons, who, riding recklessly upon
the foe, were, in their turn, to be repulsed by numbers, when fresh attacks would pour down
upon our unshaken infantry.

"That column yonder is wavering: why does he not bring up his supporting squadrons?" inquired
the Duke, pointing to a Belgian regiment of light dragoons, who were formed in the same brigade
with the seventh hussars.

"He refuses to oppose his light cavalry to cuirassiers, my lord," said an aid-de-camp, who
had just returned from the division in question.

"Tell him to march his men off the ground," said the Duke, with a quiet and impassive tone.

In less than ten minutes the regiment was seen to defile from the mass, and take the road to
Brussels, to increase the panic of that city, by circulating and strengthening the report,
that the English were beaten,--and Napoleon in full march upon the capital.

"What's Ney's force? can you guess, Sir?" said Lord Wellington turning to me.

"About twelve thousand men, my lord."

"Are the Guard among them?"

"No, Sir; the Guard are in reserve above La Belle Alliance."

"In what part of the field is Buonaparte?"

"Nearly opposite to where we stand."

"I told you, gentlemen, Hougoumont never was the great attack. The battle must be decided here,"
pointing, as he spoke, to the plain beneath us, where still Ney poured on his devoted columns,
where yet the French cavalry rode down upon our firm squares.

As he spoke an aid-de-camp rode up from the valley.

"The ninety-second requires support, my lord: they cannot maintain their positions half an
hour longer, without it."

"Have they given way, Sir?"

"No----"

"Well, then, they must stand where they are. I hear cannon towards the left; yonder, near Frischermont."

At this moment the light cavalry swept past the base of the hill on which we stood, hotly followed
by the French heavy cuirassier brigade. Three of our guns were taken; and the cheering of the
French infantry, as they advanced to the charge, presaged their hope of victory.

"Do it, then," said the Duke, in reply to some whispered question of Lord Uxbridge; and shortly
after the heavy trot of advancing squadrons was heard behind.

They were the Life Guards and the Blues, who, with the first Dragoon Guards and the Enniskilleners,
were formed into close column.

"I know the ground, my Lord," said I to Lord Uxbridge.

"Come along, Sir, come along," said he, as he threw his hussar jacket loosely behind him, to
give freedom to his sword-arm.--"Forward, my men, forward; but steady, hold your horses in
hand; threes about, and together charge."

"Charge!" he shouted; while, as the word flew from squadron to squadron, each horseman bent
upon his saddle, and that mighty mass, as though instinct with but one spirit, dashed like
a thunder-bolt upon the column beneath them. The French, blown and exhausted, inferior beside
in weight both of man and horse, offered but a short resistance. As the tall corn bends beneath
the sweeping hurricane, wave succeeding wave, so did the steel-clad squadrons of France fall
before the nervous arm of Britain's cavalry. Onward they went, carrying death and ruin before
them, and never stayed their course, until the guns were recaptured, and the cuirassiers, repulsed,
disordered, and broken, had retired beneath the protection of their artillery.

There was, as a brilliant and eloquent writer on the subject mentions, a terrible sameness
in the whole of this battle. Incessant charges of cavalry upon the squares of our infantry,
whose sole manoeuvre consisted in either deploying into line to resist the attack of infantry,
or falling back into square when the cavalry advanced--performing those two evolutions under
the devastating fire of artillery, before the unflinching heroism of that veteran infantry
whose glories had been reaped upon the blood-stained fields of Austerlitz, Marengo, and Wagram--or
opposing an unbroken front to the whirlwind swoop of infuriated cavalry;--such were the enduring
and devoted services demanded from the English troops, and such they failed not to render.
Once or twice had temper nearly failed them, and the cry ran through the ranks, "Are we never
to move forward?--Only let us at them!" But the word was not yet spoken which was to undam
the pent-up torrent, and bear down with unrelenting vengeance upon the now exulting columns
of the enemy.

It was six o'clock: the battle had continued with unchanged fortune for three hours. The French,
masters of La Haye Sainte, could never advance further into our position. They had gained the
orchard of Hougoumont, but the château was still held by the British Guards, although its blazing
roof and crumbling walls made its occupation rather the desperate stand of unflinching valor
than the maintenance of an important position. The smoke which hung upon the field rolled in
slow and heavy masses back upon the French lines, and gradually discovered to our view the
entire of the army. We quickly perceived that a change was taking place in their position.
The troops which on their left stretched far beyond Hougoumont, were now moved nearer to the
centre. The attack upon the château seemed less vigorously supported, while the oblique direction
of their right wing, which, pivoting upon Planchenoit, opposed a face to the Prussians,--all
denoted a change in their order of battle. It was now the hour when Napoleon was at last convinced
that nothing but the carnage he could no longer support could destroy the unyielding ranks
of British infantry; that although Hougoumont had been partially, La Haye Sainte, completely,
won; that although upon the right the farm-houses Papelotte and La Haye were nearly surrounded
by his troops, which with any other army must prove the forerunner of defeat: yet still the
victory was beyond his grasp. The bold stratagems, whose success the experience of a life had
proved, were here to be found powerless. The decisive manoeuvre of carrying one important point
of the enemy's lines, of turning him upon the flank, or piercing him through the centre, were
here found impracticable. He might launch his avalanche of grape-shot, he might pour down his
crashing columns of cavalry, he might send forth the iron storm of his brave infantry; but,
though death in every shape heralded their approach, still were others found to fill the fallen
ranks, and feed with their heart's blood the unslaked thirst for slaughter. Well might the
gallant leader of this gallant host, as he watched the reckless onslaught of the untiring enemy,
and looked upon the unflinching few, who, bearing the proud badge of Britain, alone sustained
the fight, well might he exclaim, "Night, or Blücher!"

It was now seven o'clock, when a dark mass was seen to form upon the heights above the French
centre, and divide into three gigantic columns, of which the right occupied the Brussels road.
These were the reserves, consisting of the Old and Young Guards, and amounting to twelve thousand--the
élite of the French army--reserved by the Emperor for a great coup-de-main. These veterans
of a hundred battles had been stationed, from the beginning of the day, inactive spectators
of the fight; their hour was now come, and, with a shout of "Vive l'Empereur!" which rose triumphantly
over the din and crash of battle, they began their march. Meanwhile, aids-de-camp galloped
along the lines, announcing the arrival of Grouchy, to reanimate the drooping spirits of the
men; for, at last, a doubt of victory was breaking upon the minds of those who never before,
in the most adverse hour of fortune, deemed his star could set that led them on to glory.

"They are coming: the attack will be made on the centre, my lord," said Lord Fitzroy Somerset,
as he directed his glass upon the column. Scarcely had he spoke when the telescope fell from
his hand, as his arm, shattered by a French bullet, fell motionless to his side.

"I see it," was the cool reply of the Duke, as he ordered the Guards to deploy into line, and
lie down behind the ridge, which now the French artillery had found the range of, and were
laboring at with their guns. In front of them the fifty-second, seventy-first, and ninety-fifth
were formed; the artillery, stationed above and partly upon the road, loaded with grape, and
waited but the word to open.

It was an awful, a dreadful moment: the Prussian cannon thundered on our left; but so desperate
was the French resistance, they made but little progress: the dark columns of the Guard had
now commenced the ascent, and the artillery ceased their fire as the bayonets of the grenadiers
showed themselves upon the slope. Then began that tremendous cheer from right to left of our
line which those who heard never can forget. It was the impatient, long-restrained burst of
unslaked vengeance. With the instinct which valor teaches, they knew the hour of trial was
come; and that wild cry flew from rank to rank, echoing from the blood-stained walls of Hougoumont
to the far-off valley of La Papelotte. "They come! they come!" was the cry; and the shout of
"Vive l'Empereur!" mingled with the outburst of the British line.

Under an overwhelming shower of grape, to which succeeded a charge of cavalry of the Imperial
Guard, the head of Ney's column fired its volley and advanced with the bayonet. The British
artillery now opened at half range, and although the plunging fire scathed and devastated the
dark ranks of the Guards, on they came,--Ney himself, on foot, at their head. Twice the leading
division of that gallant column turned completely round, as the withering fire wasted and consumed
them; but they were resolved to win.

Already they had gained the crest of the hill, and the first line of the British were falling
back before them. The artillery closes up; the flanking fire from the guns upon the road opens
upon them; the head of their column breaks like a shell; the Duke seizes the moment, and advances
on foot towards the ridge.

"Up, Guards, and at them!" he cried.

The hour of triumph and vengeance had arrived. In a moment the Guards were on their feet; one
volley was poured in; the bayonets were brought to the charge; they closed upon the enemy:
then was seen the most dreadful struggle that the history of all war can present. Furious with
long restrained passion, the guards rushed upon the leading divisions; the seventy-first, and
ninety-fifth, and twenty-sixth overlapped them on the flanks. Their generals fell thickly on
every side; Michel, Jamier, and Mallet are killed: Friant lies wounded upon the ground; Ney,
his dress pierced and ragged with balls, shouts still to advance; but the leading files waver;
they fall back; the supporting divisions thicken; confusion, panic succeeds; the British press
down; the cavalry come galloping up to their assistance; and, at last, pell-mell, overwhelmed
and beaten, the French fall back upon the Old Guard. This was the decisive moment of the day;--the
Duke closed his glass, as he said:

"The field is won. Order the whole line to advance."

On they came, four deep, and poured like a torrent from the height.

"Let the Life Guards charge them," said the Duke; but every aid-de-camp on his staff was wounded,
and I myself brought the order to Lord Uxbridge.

Lord Uxbridge had already anticipated his orders, and bore down with four regiments of heavy
cavalry upon the French centre. The Prussian artillery thundered upon their flank, and at their
rear. The British bayonet was in their front; while a panic fear spread through their ranks,
and the cry "Sauve qui peut!" resounded on all sides. In vain Ney, the bravest of the brave;
in vain Soult, Bertrand, Gourgaud, and Labedoyère, burst from the broken disorganized mass,
and called on them to stand fast. A battalion of the Old Guard, with Cambronne at their head,
alone obeyed the summons: forming into square, they stood between the pursuers and their prey,
offering themselves a sacrifice to the tarnished honor of their arms: to the order to surrender,
they answered with a cry of defiance; and, as our cavalry, flushed and elated with victory,
rode round their bristling ranks, no quailing look, no craven spirit was there. The Emperor
himself endeavored to repair the disaster; he rode with lightening speed hither and thither,
commanding, ordering, nay imploring too; but already the night was falling, the confusion became
each moment more inextricable, and the effort was a fruitless one. A regiment of the Guards,
and two batteries were in reserve behind Planchenoit; he threw them rapidly into position;
but the overwhelming impulse of flight drove the mass upon them, and they were carried away
upon the torrent of the beaten army. No sooner did the Emperor see this his last hope desert
him, than he dismounted from his horse, and, drawing his sword, threw himself into a square,
which the first regiment of chasseurs of the Old Guard had formed with a remnant of the battalion;
Jerome followed him, as he called out:

"You are right, brother: here should perish all who bear the name of Buonaparte."

The same moment the Prussian light artillery rend the ranks asunder, and the cavalry charge
down upon the scattered fragments. A few of his staff, who never left him, place the Emperor
upon a horse,--and fly.

LX. THE DIVER.

EDWARD BULWER, LORD LYTTON.--1805-1873.

Translated from the German of Schiller.

    "O where is the knight or the squire so bold
      As to dive to the howling Charybdis below?--
    I cast in the whirlpool a goblet of gold,
      And o'er it already the dark waters flow;
    Whoever to me may the goblet bring,
    Shall have for his guerdon that gift of his king."

    He spoke, and the cup from the terrible steep,
      That, rugged and hoary, hung over the verge
    Of the endless and measureless world of the deep,
      Swirl'd into the maelstrom that madden'd the surge.
    "And where is the diver so stout to go--
    I ask ye again--to the deep below?"

    And the knights and the squires that gather'd around,
      Stood silent--and fix'd on the ocean their eyes;
    They look'd on the dismal and savage profound,
      And the peril chill'd back every thought of the prize.
    And thrice spoke the monarch: "The cup to win,
    Is there never a wight who will venture in?"

    And all as before heard in silence the king,
      Till a youth with an aspect unfearing but gentle,
    'Mid the tremulous squires stepp'd out from the ring,
      Unbuckling his girdle, and doffing his mantle;
    And the murmuring crowd, as they parted asunder,
    On the stately boy cast their looks of wonder.

    As he strode to the marge of the summit, and gave
      One glance on the gulf of that merciless main,
    Lo! the wave that for ever devours the wave,
      Casts roaringly up the Charybdis again:
    And, as with the swell of the far thunder-boom,
    Rushes foamingly forth from the heart of the gloom.

    And it bubbles and seethes, and it hisses and roars,
      As when fire is with water commix'd and contending,
    And the spray of its wrath to the welkin up-soars,
      And flood upon flood hurries on, never ending;
    And it never will rest, nor from travail be free,
    Like a sea that is laboring the birth of a sea.

    Yet, at length, comes a lull o'er the mighty commotion,
      And dark through the whiteness, and still through the swell,
    The whirlpool cleaves downward and downward in ocean
      A yawning abyss, like the pathway to hell;
    The stiller and darker the farther it goes,
    Suck'd into that smoothness the breakers repose.

    The youth gave his trust to his Maker! Before
      That path through the riven abyss closed again,
    Hark! a shriek from the gazers that circle the shore,--
      And, behold! he is whirl'd in the grasp of the main!
    And o'er him the breakers mysteriously roll'd,
    And the giant-mouth closed on the swimmer so bold.

    All was still on the height, save the murmur that went
      From the grave of the deep, sounding hollow and fell,
    Or save when the tremulous, sighing lament
      Thrill'd from lip unto lip, "Gallant youth, fare thee well!"
    More hollow and more wails the deep on the ear,--
    More dread and more dread grows suspense in its fear.

    --If thou shouldst in those waters thy diadem fling,
      And cry, "Who may find it shall win it and wear";
    God wot, though the prize were the crown of a king,
      A crown at such hazard were valued too dear.
    For never shall lips of the living reveal
    What the deeps that howl yonder in terror conceal.

    Oh, many a bark, to that breast grappled fast,
      Has gone down to the fearful and fathomless grave;
    Again, crash'd together the keel and the mast,
      To be seen toss'd aloft in the glee of the wave!--
    Like the growth of a storm ever louder and clearer,
    Grows the roar of the gulf rising nearer and nearer.

    And, lo! from the heart of that far-floating gloom,
      Like the wing of the cygnet--what gleams on the sea?
    Lo! an arm and a neck glancing up from the tomb!
      Steering stalwart and shoreward: O joy, it is he!
    The left hand is lifted in triumph; behold,
    It waves as a trophy the goblet of gold!

    And he breathèd deep, and he breathèd long,
      And he greeted the heavenly light of the day.
    They gaze on each other,--they shout as they throng,
      "He lives--lo, the ocean has render'd its prey!
    And safe from the whirlpool, and free from the grave,
    Comes back to the daylight the soul of the brave!"

    And he comes, with the crowd in their clamor and glee;
      And the goblet his daring has won from the water
    He lifts to the king as he sinks on his knee
      And the king from her maidens has beckon'd his daughter.
    She pours to the boy the bright wine which they bring,
    And thus spoke the diver; "Long life to the King!

    "Happy they whom the rose-hues of daylight rejoice,
      The air and the sky that to mortals are given!
    May the horror below nevermore find a voice,--
      Nor man stretch too far the wide mercy of Heaven!
    Nevermore,--nevermore may he lift from the sight
    The veil which is woven with terror and night!

    "Quick brightening like lightning the ocean rush'd o'er me,
      Wild floating, borne down fathom-deep from the day;
    Till a torrent rush'd out on the torrents that bore me,
      And doubled the tempest that whirl'd me away.
    Vain, vain was my struggle,--the circle had won me,
    Round and round in its dance the mad element spun me.

    "From the deep then I call'd upon God, and He heard me;
      In the dread of my need, He vouchsafed to mine eye
    A rock jutting out from the grave that interr'd me;
      I sprung there, I clung there,--and death pass'd me by.
    And, lo! where the goblet gleam'd through the abyss,
    By a coral reef saved from the far Fathomless.

    "Below, at the foot of that precipice drear,
      Spread the gloomy and purple and pathless Obscure!
    A silence of horror that slept on the ear,
      That the eye more appall'd might the horror endure;
    Salamander, snake, dragon--vast reptiles that dwell
    In the deep--coil'd about the grim jaws of their hell.

    "Dark crawl'd, glided dark, the unspeakable swarms,
      Clump'd together in masses, misshapen and vast;
    Here clung and here bristled the fashionless forms;
      Here the dark-moving bulk of the hammer-fish pass'd;
    And, with teeth grinning white, and a menacing motion,
    Went the terrible shark,--the hyena of ocean.

    "There I hung, and the awe gather'd icily o'er me,
      So far from the earth, where man's help there was none!
    The one human thing, with the goblins before me--
      Alone--in a loneness so ghastly--ALONE!
    Deep under the reach of the sweet living breath,
    And begirt with the broods of the desert of Death.

    "Methought, as I gazed through the darkness, that now
      IT saw--a dread hundred-limb'd creature--its prey!
    And darted, devouring; I sprang from the bough
      Of the coral, and swept on the horrible way;
    And the whirl of the mighty wave seized me once more,
    It seized me to save me, and dash to the shore."

    On the youth gazed the monarch, and marvell'd: quoth he,
      "Bold diver, the goblet I promised is thine;
    And this ring I will give, a fresh guerdon to thee--
      Never jewels more precious shone up from the mine--
    If thou'lt bring me fresh tidings, and venture again,
    To say what lies hid in the innermost main."

    Then out spake the daughter in tender emotion:
      "Ah! father, my father, what more can there rest?
    Enough of this sport with the pitiless ocean:
      He has serv'd thee as none would, thyself hast confest.
    If nothing can slake thy wild thirst of desire,
    Let thy knights put to shame the exploit of the squire!"

    The king seized the goblet, he swung it on high,
      And whirling, it fell in the roar of the tide;
    "But bring back that goblet again to my eye,
      And I'll hold thee the dearest that rides by my side;
    And thine arms shall embrace as thy bride, I decree,
    The maiden whose pity now pleadeth for thee."

    And Heaven, as he listen'd, spoke out from the space,
      And the hope that makes heroes shot flame from his eyes;
    He gazed on the blush in that beautiful face--
      It pales--at the feet of her father she lies!
    How priceless the guerdon!--a moment--a breath--
    And headlong he plunges to life and to death!

    They hear the loud surges sweep back in their swell,
      Their coming the thunder-sound heralds along!
    Fond eyes yet are tracking the spot where he fell.
      They come, the wild waters, in tumult and throng,
    Roaring up to the cliff,--roaring back as before,
    But no wave ever brings the lost youth to the shore!

LXI. THE PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS.

CARDINAL NEWMAN.--1801-

From CALLISTA.

Juba's finger was directed to a spot where, amid the thick foliage, the gleam of a pool or
of a marsh was visible. The various waters round about, issuing from the gravel, or drained
from the nightly damps, had run into a hollow, filled with the decaying vegetation of former
years. Its banks were bordered with a deep, broad layer of mud, a transition substance between
the rich vegetable matter which it once had been, and the multitudinous world of insect life
which it was becoming. A cloud or mist at this time was hanging over it, high in air. A harsh
and shrill sound, a whizzing or a chirping, proceeded from that cloud to the ear of the attentive
listener. What these indications portended was plain....

The plague of locusts, one of the most awful visitations to which the countries included in
the Roman empire were exposed, extended from the Atlantic to Ethiopia, from Arabia to India,
and from the Nile and Red Sea to Greece and the north of Asia Minor. Instances are recorded
in history of clouds of the devastating insect crossing the Black Sea to Poland, and the Mediterranean
to Lombardy. It is as numerous in its species as it is wide in its range of territory. Brood
follows brood, with a sort of family likeness, yet with distinct attributes. It wakens into
existence and activity as early as the month of March; but instances are not wanting, as in
our present history, of its appearance as late as June. Even one flight comprises myriads upon
myriads passing imagination, to which the drops of rain or the sands of the sea are the only
fit comparison; and hence it is almost a proverbial mode of expression in the East, by way
of describing a vast invading army, to liken it to the locusts. So dense are they, when upon
the wing, that it is no exaggeration to say that they hide the sun, from which circumstance
indeed their name in Arabic is derived. And so ubiquitous are they when they have alighted
on the earth, that they simply cover or clothe its surface.

This last characteristic is stated in the sacred account of the plagues of Egypt, where their
faculty of devastation is also mentioned. The corrupting fly and the bruising and prostrating
hail preceded them in that series of visitations, but they came to do the work of ruin more
thoroughly. For not only the crops and fruits, but the foliage of the forest itself, nay, the
small twigs and the bark of the trees are the victims of their curious and energetic rapacity.
They have been known even to gnaw the door-posts of the houses. Nor do they execute their task
in so slovenly a way, that, as they have succeeded other plagues, so they may have successors
themselves. They take pains to spoil what they leave. Like the Harpies, they smear every thing
that they touch with a miserable slime, which has the effect of a virus in corroding, or as
some say, in scorching and burning. And then, perhaps, as if all this were little, when they
can do nothing else, they die; as if out of sheer malevolence to man, for the poisonous elements
of their nature are then let loose and dispersed abroad, and create a pestilence; and they
manage to destroy many more by their death than in their life.

Such are the locusts. And now they are rushing upon a considerable tract of that beautiful
region of which we have spoken with such admiration. The swarm to which Juba pointed grew and
grew till it became a compact body, as much as a furlong square; yet it was but the vanguard
of a series of similar hosts, formed one after another out of the hot mould or sand, rising
into the air like clouds, enlarging into a dusky canopy, and then discharged against the fruitful
plain. At length the huge innumerous mass was put into motion, and began its career, darkening
the face of day. As became an instrument of divine power, it seemed to have no volition of
its own; it was set off, it drifted, with the wind, and thus made northwards, straight for
Sicca. Thus they advanced, host after host, for a time wafted on the air, and gradually declining
to the earth, while fresh broods were carried over the first, and neared the earth, after a
longer flight, in their turn. For twelve miles did they extend from front to rear, and their
whizzing and hissing could be heard for six miles on every side of them. The bright sun, though
hidden by them, illumined their bodies, and was reflected from their quivering wings; and as
they heavily fell earthward, they seemed like the innumerable flakes of a yellow-colored snow.
And like snow did they descend, a living carpet, or rather pall, upon fields, crops, gardens,
copses, groves, orchards, vineyards, olive woods, orangeries, palm plantations, and the deep
forests, sparing nothing within their reach, and where there was nothing to devour, lying helpless
in drifts, or crawling forward obstinately, as they best might, with the hope of prey. They
could spare their hundred thousand soldiers twice or thrice over, and not miss them; their
masses filled the bottoms of the ravines and hollow ways, impeding the traveller as he rode
forward on his journey and trampled by thousands under his horse-hoofs. In vain was all this
overthrow and waste by the roadside, in vain their loss in river, pool, and watercourse. The
poor peasants hastily dug pits and trenches as their enemy came on; in vain they filled them
from the wells or with lighted stubble. Heavily and thickly did the locusts fall; they were
lavish of their lives; they choked the flame and the water, which destroyed them the while,
and the vast living hostile armament still moved on.

They moved right on like soldiers in their ranks, stopping at nothing, and straggling for nothing;
they carried a broad furrow or wheal all across the country, black and loathsome, while it
was as green and smiling on each side of them and in front, as it had been before they came.
Before them, in the language of prophets, was a paradise, and behind them a desert. They are
daunted by nothing they surmount walls and hedges, and enter enclosed gardens or inhabited
houses. A rare and experimental vineyard has been planted in a sheltered grove. The high winds
of Africa will not commonly allow the light trellice or the slim pole; but here the lofty poplar
of Campania has been possible, on which the vine plant mounts so many yards into the air, that
the poor grape-gatherers bargain for a funeral pile and a tomb as one of the conditions of
their engagement. The locusts have done what the winds and lightning could not do, and the
whole promise of the vintage, leaves and all, is gone, and the slender stems are left bare.
There is another yard, less uncommon, but still tended with more than common care; each plant
is kept within due bounds by a circular trench round it, and by upright canes on which it is
to trail; in an hour the solicitude and long toil of the vine-dresser are lost, and his pride
humbled. There is a smiling farm; another sort of vine, of remarkable character, is found against
the farmhouse. This vine springs from one root, and has clothed and matted with its many branches
the four walls. The whole of it is covered thick with long clusters, which another month will
ripen. On every grape and leaf there is a locust. Into the dry caves and pits, carefully strewed
with straw, the harvest-men have (safely, as they thought just now) been lodging the far-famed
African wheat. One grain or root shoots up into ten, twenty, fifty, eighty, nay, three or four
hundred stalks: sometimes the stalks have two ears apiece, and these shoot into a number of
lesser ones. These stores are intended for the Roman populace, but the locusts have been beforehand
with them. The small patches of ground belonging to the poor peasants up and down the country,
for raising the turnips, garlic, barley, water-melons, on which they live, are the prey of
these glutton invaders as much as the choicest vines and olives. Nor have they any reverence
for the villa of the civic decurion or the Roman official. The neatly arranged kitchen garden,
with its cherries, plums, peaches, and apricots, is a waste; as the slaves sit round, in the
kitchen in the first court, at their coarse evening meal, the room is filled with the invading
force, and news comes to them that the enemy has fallen upon the apples and pears in the basement,
and is at the same time plundering and sacking the preserves of quince and pomegranate, and
revelling in the jars of precious oil of Cyprus and Mendes in the store-rooms.

They come up to the walls of Sicca, and are flung against them into the ditch. Not a moment's
hesitation or delay; they recover their footing, they climb up the wood or stucco, they surmount
the parapet, or they have entered in at the windows, filling the apartments, and the most private
and luxurious chambers, not one or two, like stragglers at forage or rioters after a victory,
but in order of battle, and with the array of an army. Choice plants or flowers about the impluvia
and xysti, for ornament or refreshment, myrtles, oranges, pomegranates, the rose and the carnation,
have disappeared. They dim the bright marbles of the walls and the gilding of the ceilings.
They enter the triclinium in the midst of the banquet; they crawl over the viands and spoil
what they do not devour. Unrelaxed by success and by enjoyment, onward they go; a secret mysterious
instinct keeps them together, as if they had a king over them. They move along the floor in
so strange an order that they seem to be a tessellated pavement themselves, and to be the artificial
embellishment of the place; so true are their lines, and so perfect is the pattern they describe.
Onward they go, to the market, to the temple sacrifices, to the bakers' stores, to the cookshops,
to the confectioners, to the druggists; nothing comes amiss to them; wherever man has aught
to eat or drink, there are they, reckless of death, strong of appetite, certain of conquest....

Another and a still worse calamity. The invaders, as we have already hinted, could be more
terrible still in their overthrow than in their ravages. The inhabitants of the country had
attempted, where they could, to destroy them by fire and water. It would seem as if the malignant
animals had resolved that the sufferers should have the benefit of this policy to the full;
for they had not got more than twenty miles beyond Sicca when they suddenly sickened and died.
When they thus had done all the mischief they could by their living, when they thus had made
their foul maws the grave of every living thing, next they died themselves, and made the desolated
land their own grave. They took from it its hundred forms and varieties of beautiful life,
and left it their own fetid and poisonous carcases in payment. It was a sudden catastrophe;
they seemed making for the Mediterranean, as if, like other great conquerors, they had other
worlds to subdue beyond it; but, whether they were overgorged, or struck by some atmospheric
change, or that their time was come and they paid the debt of nature, so it was that suddenly
they fell, and their glory came to nought, and all was vanity to them as to others, and "their
stench rose up, and their corruption rose up, because they had done proudly."

The hideous swarms lay dead in the moist steaming underwoods, in the green swamps, in the sheltered
valleys, in the ditches and furrows of the fields, amid the monuments of their own prowess,
the ruined crops and the dishonored vineyards. A poisonous element, issuing from their remains,
mingled with the atmosphere, and corrupted it. The dismayed peasant found that a plague had
begun; a new visitation, not confined to the territory which the enemy had made its own, but
extending far and wide, as the atmosphere extends, in all directions. Their daily toil, no
longer claimed by the fruits of the earth, which have ceased to exist, is now devoted to the
object of ridding themselves of the deadly legacy which they have received in their stead.
In vain; it is their last toil; they are digging pits, they are raising piles, for their own
corpses, as well as for the bodies of their enemies. Invader and victim lie in the same grave,
burn in the same heap; they sicken while they work, and the pestilence spreads.

LXII. THE CANE-BOTTOM'D CHAIR.

WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.--1811-1863.

    In tatter'd old slippers that toast at the bars,
    And a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars,
    Away from the world and its toils and its cares,
    I've a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs.

    To mount to this realm is a toil, to be sure,
    But the fire there is bright and the air rather pure;
    And the view I behold on a sunshiny day
    Is grand through the chimney-pots over the way.

    This snug little chamber is cramm'd in all nooks
    With worthless old knicknacks and silly old books,
    And foolish old odds and foolish old ends,
    Crack'd bargains from brokers, cheap keepsakes from friends.

    Old armor, prints, pictures, pipes, china, (all crack'd,)
    Old rickety tables, and chairs broken-back'd;
    A twopenny treasury, wondrous to see;
    What matter? 'tis pleasant to you, friend, and me.

    No better divan need the Sultan require,
    Than the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire;
    And 'tis wonderful, surely, what music you get
    From the rickety, ramshackle, wheezy spinet.

    That praying-rug came from a Turcoman's camp;
    By Tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp;
    A Mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn:
    'Tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon.

    Long, long through the hours, and the night, and the chimes,
    Here we talk of old books, and old friends, and old times;
    As we sit in a fog made of rich Latakie
    This chamber is pleasant to you, friend, and me.

    But of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest,
    There's one that I love and I cherish the best;
    For the finest of couches that's padded with hair
    I never would change thee, my cane-bottom'd chair.

    'Tis a bandy-legg'd, high-shoulder'd, worm-eaten seat,
    With a creaking old back, and twisted old feet;
    But since the fair morning when Fanny sat there,
    I bless thee, and love thee, old cane-bottom'd chair.

    If chairs have but feeling, in holding such charms,
    A thrill must have pass'd through your wither'd old arms!
    I look'd, and I long'd, and I wish'd in despair;
    I wish'd myself turn'd to a cane-bottom'd chair.

    It was but a moment she sat in this place,
    She'd a scarf on her neck, and a smile on her face!
    A smile on her face, and a rose in her hair,
    And she sat there, and bloom'd in my cane-bottom'd chair.

    And so I have valued my chair ever since,
    Like the shrine of a saint, or the throne of a prince;
    Saint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare,
    The queen of my heart and my cane-bottom'd chair.

    When the candles burn low, and the company's gone,
    In the silence of night as I sit here alone--
    I sit here alone, but we yet are a pair--
    My Fanny I see in my cane-bottom'd chair.

    She comes from the past and revisits my room;
    She looks as she then did, all beauty and bloom;
    So smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair,
    And yonder she sits in my cane-bottom'd chair.

LXIII. THE RECONCILIATION.[N]

THACKERAY. But I knew you would come back--I own that.

The late Lord Castlewood had been killed in a duel, and young Esmond, who had lived in his
house as a dependant (reputed to have been illegitimately related to a former Viscount of Castlewood),
devotedly attending him at his death-bed, received from the dying man confession and proof
that he, the supposed obscure orphan, was the true inheritor, and in justice ought to have
been the possessor, of the Castlewood titles and estates. But Esmond, for the love he had borne
his patron, and from devotion to Lady Castlewood, who had much befriended him, immediately
destroyed the proofs which were given him of his honorable parentage, and ever afterwards kept
his claim a secret. After the duel, while Esmond was in prison, Lady Castlewood visited him,
and in the wildness of her grief for her murdered husband, reproached her loyal kinsman for
not having saved her lord's life, or avenged his death. In the estrangement which these reproaches
occasioned, Esmond sought his fortune abroad in war; but subsequently, desiring to learn of
the welfare of his mistress and her family, whose happiness he prized more than his own, he
returned to England, and went to Winchester, near which was Walcote, Lady Castlewood's home.
The family were attending service in the cathedral, and there the reconciliation took place.--Esmond
had formerly been promised the living of Walcote, but the vacancy occurring while the estrangement
continued. Lady Castlewood had given it to one Mr. Tusher.

LXIV. THE ISLAND OF THE SCOTS.

(DECEMBER, 1697.)

WILLIAM EDMONDSTOUNE AYTOUN.--1813-1865.

    The Rhine is running deep and red, the island lies before,--
    "Now is there one of all the host will dare to venture o'er?
    For not alone the river's sweep might make a brave man quail;
    The foe are on the further side, their shot comes fast as hail.
    God help us, if the middle isle we may not hope to win!
    Now is there any of the host will dare to venture in?"

    "The ford is deep, the banks are steep, the island-shore lies wide;
    Nor man nor horse could stem its force, or reach the further side.
    See there! amidst the willow-boughs the serried bayonets gleam;
    They've flung their bridge,--they've won the isle; the foe have
              cross'd the stream!
    Their volley flashes sharp and strong,--by all the saints! I trow
    There never yet was soldier born could force that passage now!"

    So spoke the bold French Mareschal with him who led the van,
    Whilst rough and red before their view the turbid river ran.
    Nor bridge nor boat had they to cross the wild and swollen Rhine,
    And thundering on the other bank far stretch'd the German line.
    Hard by there stood a swarthy man was leaning on his sword,
    And a sadden'd smile lit up his face as he heard the Captain's word.
    "I've seen a wilder stream ere now than that which rushes there;
    I've stemm'd a heavier torrent yet and never thought to dare.
    If German steel be sharp and keen, is ours not strong and true?
    There may be danger in the deed, but there is honor too."

    The old lord in his saddle turn'd, and hastily he said,
    "Hath bold Duguesclin's fiery heart awaken'd from the dead?
    Thou art the leader of the Scots,--now well and sure I know,
    That gentle blood in dangerous hour ne'er yet ran cold nor slow,
    And I have seen ye in the fight do all that mortal may:
    If honor is the boon ye seek, it may be won this day,--
    The prize is in the middle isle, there lies the adventurous way,
    And armies twain are on the plain, the daring deed to see,--
    Now ask thy gallant company if they will follow thee!"

    Right gladsome look'd the Captain then, and nothing did he say,
    But he turn'd him to his little band,--O, few, I ween, were they!
    The relics of the bravest force that ever fought in fray.
    No one of all that company but bore a gentle name,
    Not one whose fathers had not stood in Scotland's fields of fame.
    All they had march'd with great Dundee to where he fought and fell,
    And in the deadly battle-strife had venged their leader well:
    And they had bent the knee to earth when every eye was dim,
    As o'er their hero's buried corpse they sang the funeral hymn;
    And they had trod the Pass once more, and stoop'd on either side
    To pluck the heather from the spot where he had dropp'd and died;
    And they had bound it next their hearts, and ta'en a last farewell
    Of Scottish earth and Scottish sky, where Scotland's glory fell.
    Then went they forth to foreign lands like bent and broken men,
    Who leave their dearest hope behind, and may not turn again.

    "The stream," he said, "is broad and deep, and stubborn is
              the foe,--
    Yon island-strength is guarded well,--say, brothers, will ye go?
    From home and kin for many a year our steps have wander'd wide,
    And never may our bones be laid our fathers' graves beside.
    No children have we to lament, no wives to wail our fall;
    The traitor's and the spoiler's hand have reft our hearths of all.
    But we have hearts, and we have arms, as strong to will and dare
    As when our ancient banners flew within the northern air.
    Come, brothers! let me name a spell shall rouse your souls again,
    And send the old blood bounding free through pulse and heart
              and vein.
    Call back the days of bygone years,--be young and strong once more;
    Think yonder stream, so stark and red, is one we've cross'd before.
    Rise, hill and glen! rise, crag and wood! rise up on either hand,--
    Again upon the Garry's banks, on Scottish soil we stand!
    Again I see the tartans wave, again the trumpets ring;
    Again I hear our leader's call: 'Upon them for the King!'
    Stay'd we behind that glorious day for roaring flood or linn?
    The soul of Græme is with us still,--now, brothers, will ye in?"

    No stay,--no pause. With one accord, they grasp'd each other's hand,
    Then plunged into the angry flood, that bold and dauntless band.
    High flew the spray above their heads, yet onward still they bore,
    Midst cheer, and shout, and answering yell, and shot, and
              cannon-roar,--
    "Now, by the Holy Cross! I swear, since earth and sea began,
    Was never such a daring deed essay'd by mortal man!"

    Thick blew the smoke across the stream, and faster flash'd the
              flame:
    The water plash'd in hissing jets as ball and bullet came.
    Yet onwards push'd the Cavaliers all stern and undismay'd,
    With thousand armèd foes before, and none behind to aid.
    Once, as they near'd the middle stream, so strong the torrent swept,
    That scarce that long and living wall their dangerous footing kept.
    Then rose a warning cry behind, a joyous shout before:
    "The current's strong,--the way is long,--they'll never reach the
              shore!
    See, see! they stagger in the midst, they waver in their line!
    Fire on the madmen! break their ranks, and whelm them in the Rhine!"

    Have you seen the tall trees swaying when the blast is sounding
              shrill,
    And the whirlwind reels in fury down the gorges of the hill?
    How they toss their mighty branches struggling with the tempest's
              shock;
    How they keep their place of vantage, cleaving firmly to the rock?
    Even so the Scottish warriors held their own against the river;
    Though the water flash'd around them, not an eye was seen to quiver;
    Though the shot flew sharp and deadly, not a man relax'd his hold;
    For their hearts were big and thrilling with the mighty thoughts
              of old.
    One word was spoke among them, and through the ranks it spread,--
    "Remember our dead Claverhouse!" was all the Captain said.
    Then, sternly bending forward, they wrestled on a while,
    Until they clear'd the heavy stream, then rush'd towards the isle.

    The German heart is stout and true, the German arm is strong;
    The German foot goes seldom back where armèd foemen throng.
    But never had they faced in field so stern a charge before,
    And never had they felt the sweep of Scotland's broad claymore.
    Not fiercer pours the avalanche adown the steep incline,
    That rises o'er the parent-springs of rough and rapid Rhine,--
    Scarce swifter shoots the bolt from heaven than came the Scottish
              band
    Right up against the guarded trench, and o'er it sword in hand.
    In vain their leaders forward press,--they meet the deadly brand!

    O lonely island of the Rhine,--where seed was never sown,
    What harvest lay upon thy sands, by those strong reapers thrown?
    What saw the winter moon that night, as, struggling through the
              rain,
    She pour'd a wan and fitful light on marsh, and stream, and plain?
    A dreary spot with corpses strewn, and bayonets glistening round;
    A broken bridge, a stranded boat, a bare and batter'd mound;
    And one huge watch-fire's kindled pile, that sent its quivering
              glare
    To tell the leaders of the host the conquering Scots were there!

    And did they twine the laurel-wreath, for those who fought so well?
    And did they honor those who liv'd, and weep for those who fell?
    What meed of thanks was given to them let agèd annals tell.
    Why should they bring the laurel-wreath,--why crown the cup with
              wine?
    It was not Frenchmen's blood that flow'd so freely on the Rhine,--
    A stranger band of beggar'd men had done the venturous deed:
    The glory was to France alone, the danger was their meed.
    And what cared they for idle thanks from foreign prince and peer?
    What virtue had such honey'd words the exiled heart to cheer?
    What matter'd it that men should vaunt and loud and fondly swear,
    That higher feat of chivalry was never wrought elsewhere?
    They bore within their breasts the grief that fame can never heal,--
    The deep, unutterable woe which none save exiles feel.
    Their hearts were yearning for the land they ne'er might see
              again,--
    For Scotland's high and heather'd hills, for mountain, loch and
              glen--
    For those who haply lay at rest beyond the distant sea,
    Beneath the green and daisied turf where they would gladly be!

    Long years went by. The lonely isle in Rhine's tempestuous flood
    Has ta'en another name from those who bought it with their blood:

    And, though the legend does not live,--for legends lightly die--
    The peasant, as he sees the stream in winter rolling by,
    And foaming o'er its channel-bed between him and the spot
    Won by the warriors of the sword, stills calls that deep and
              dangerous ford
        The Passage of the Scot.

    Sacrifice and Self-Devotion hallow earth and fill the skies.

        LORD HOUGHTON.--1809-1885.

LXV. THE GAMBLING PARTY.

EARL OF BEACONSFIELD.--1805-1881.

From THE YOUNG DUKE.

The young Duke had accepted the invitation of the Baron de Berghem for to-morrow, and accordingly,
himself, Lords Castlefort and Dice, and Temple Grace assembled in Brunswick Terrace at the
usual hour. The dinner was studiously plain, and very little wine was drunk; yet everything
was perfect. Tom Cogit stepped in to carve in his usual silent manner. He always came in and
went out of a room without anyone observing him. He winked familiarly to Temple Grace, but
scarcely presumed to bow to the Duke. He was very busy about the wine, and dressed the wild
fowl in a manner quite unparalleled. He took particular care to send a most perfect portion
to the young Duke, and he did this, as he paid all attentions to influential strangers, with
the most marked consciousness of the sufferance which permitted his presence: never addressing
his Grace, but audibly whispering to the servant, "Take this to the Duke"; or asking the attendant,
"whether his Grace would try the Hermitage?"

After dinner, with the exception of Cogit, who was busied in compounding some wonderful liquid
for the future refreshment, they sat down to écarté. Without having exchanged a word upon the
subject, there seemed a general understanding among all the parties that to-night was to be
a pitched battle, and they began at once, briskly. Yet, in spite of their universal determination,
midnight arrived without anything decisive. Another hour passed over, and then Tom Cogit kept
touching the Baron's elbow and whispering in a voice which everybody could understand. All
this meant that supper was ready. It was brought into the room.

Gaming has one advantage, it gives you an appetite; that is to say, so long as you have a chance
remaining. The Duke had thousands; for at present his resources were unimpared, and he was
exhausted by the constant attention and anxiety of five hours. He passed over the delicacies
and went to the side-table, and began cutting himself some cold roast beef. Tom Cogit ran up,
not to his Grace, but to the Baron, to announce the shocking fact that the Duke of St. James
was enduring great trouble; and then the Baron asked his Grace to permit Mr. Cogit to serve
him. Our hero devoured: we use the word advisedly, as fools say in the House of Commons: he
devoured the roast beef, and rejecting the Hermitage with disgust, asked for porter.

They set to again fresh as eagles. At six o'clock accounts were so complicated that they stopped
to make up their books. Each played with his memoranda and pencil at his side. Nothing fatal
had yet happened. The Duke owed Lord Dice about five thousand pounds, and Temple Grace owed
him as many hundreds. Lord Castlefort also was his debtor to the tune of seven hundred and
fifty, and the Baron was in his books, but slightly. Every half-hour they had a new pack of
cards, and threw the used one on the floor. All this time Tom Cogit did nothing but snuff the
candles, stir the fire, bring them a new pack, and occasionally make a tumbler for them. At
eight o'clock the Duke's situation was worsened. The run was greatly against him, and perhaps
his losses were doubled. He pulled up again the next hour or two; but nevertheless, at ten
o'clock, owed every one something. No one offered to give over; and everyone, perhaps, felt
that his object was not obtained. They made their toilets and went down-stairs to breakfast.
In the meantime the shutters were opened, the room aired, and in less than an hour they were
at it again.

They played till dinner-time without intermission; and though the Duke made some desperate
efforts, and some successful ones, his losses were, nevertheless, trebled. Yet he ate an excellent
dinner and was not at all depressed; because the more he lost, the more his courage and his
resources seemed to expand. At first he had limited himself to ten thousand; after breakfast
it was to have been twenty thousand; then thirty thousand was the ultimatum; and now he dismissed
all thoughts of limits from his mind, and was determined to risk or gain everything.

At midnight, he had lost forty-eight thousand pounds. Affairs now began to be serious. His
supper was not so hearty. While the rest were eating, he walked about the room, and began to
limit his ambition to recovery, and not to gain. When you play to win back, the fun is over:
there is nothing to recompense you for your bodily tortures and your degraded feelings; and
the very best result that can happen, while it has no charms, seems to your cowed mind impossible.

On they played, and the Duke lost more. His mind was jaded. He floundered, he made desperate
efforts, but plunged deeper in the slough. Feeling that, to regain his ground, each card must
tell, he acted on each as if it must win, and the consequences of this insanity (for a gamester
at such a crisis is really insane) were, that his losses were prodigious.

Another morning came, and there they sat, ankle-deep in cards. No attempt at breakfast now,
no affectation of making a toilet or airing the room. The atmosphere was hot, to be sure, but
it well became such a Hell. There they sat, in total, in positive forgetfulness of everything
but the hot game they were hunting down. There was not a man in the room, except Tom Cogit,
who could have told you the name of the town in which they were living. There they sat, almost
breathless, watching every turn with the fell look in their cannibal eyes which showed their
total inability to sympathize with their fellow-beings. All forms of society had been long
forgotten. There was no snuff-box handed about now, for courtesy, admiration, or a pinch; no
affectation of occasionally making a remark upon any other topic but the all-engrossing one.
Lord Castlefort rested with his arms on the table: a false tooth had got unhinged. His Lordship,
who, at any other time, would have been most annoyed, coolly put it in his pocket. His cheeks
had fallen, and he looked twenty years older. Lord Dice had torn off his cravat, and his hair
hung down over his callous, bloodless cheeks, straight as silk. Temple Grace looked as if he
were blighted by lightning; and his deep blue eyes gleamed like a hyena's. The Baron was least
changed. Tom Cogit, who smelt that the crisis was at hand, was as quiet as a bribed rat.

On they played till six o'clock in the evening, and then they agreed to desist till after dinner.
Lord Dice threw himself on a sofa. Lord Castlefort breathed with difficulty. The rest walked
about. While they were resting on their oars, the young Duke roughly made up his accounts.
He found that he was minus about one hundred thousand pounds.

Immense as this loss was, he was more struck, more appalled, let us say, at the strangeness
of the surrounding scene, than even by his own ruin. As he looked upon his fellow gamesters,
he seemed, for the first time in his life, to gaze upon some of those hideous demons of whom
he had read. He looked in the mirror at himself. A blight seemed to have fallen over his beauty,
and his presence seemed accursed. He had pursued a dissipated, even more than a dissipated
career. Many were the nights that had been spent by him not on his couch; great had been the
exhaustion that he had often experienced; haggard had sometimes even been the lustre of his
youth. But when had been marked upon his brow this harrowing care? when had his features before
been stamped with this anxiety, this anguish, this baffled desire, this strange unearthly scowl,
which made him even tremble? What! was it possible? it could not be, that in time he was to
be like those awful, those unearthly, those unhallowed things that were around him. He felt
as if he had fallen from his state, as if he had dishonored his ancestry, as if he had betrayed
his trust. He felt a criminal. In the darkness of his meditations a flash burst from his lurid
mind, a celestial light appeared to dissipate this thickening gloom, and his soul felt as if
it were bathed with the softening radiancy. He thought of May Dacre, he thought of everything
that was pure, and holy, and beautiful, and luminous, and calm. It was the innate virtue of
the man that made this appeal to his corrupted nature. His losses seemed nothing; his dukedom
would be too slight a ransom for freedom from these ghouls, and for the breath of the sweet air.

He advanced to the Baron, and expressed his desire to play no more. There was an immediate
stir. All jumped up, and now the deed was done. Cant, in spite of their exhaustion, assumed
her reign. They begged him to have his revenge, were quite annoyed at the result, had no doubt
he would recover if he proceeded. Without noticing their remarks, he seated himself at the
table, and wrote cheques for their respective amounts, Tom Cogit jumping up and bringing him
the inkstand. Lord Castlefort, in the most affectionate manner, pocketed the draft; at the
same time recommending the Duke not to be in a hurry, but to send it when he was cool. Lord
Dice received his with a bow, Temple Grace with a sigh, the Baron with an avowal of his readiness
always to give him his revenge.

The Duke, though sick at heart, would not leave the room with any evidence of a broken spirit;
and when Lord Castlefort again repeated, "Pay us when we meet again," he said, "I think it
very improbable that we shall meet again, my Lord. I wished to know what gaming was. I had
heard a great deal about it. It is not so very disgusting; but I am a young man, and cannot
play tricks with my complexion."

He reached his house. He gave orders for himself not to be disturbed, and he went to bed; but
in vain he tried to sleep. What rack exceeds the torture of an excited brain and an exhausted
body? His hands and feet were like ice, his brow like fire; his ears rung with supernatural
roaring; a nausea had seized upon him, and death he would have welcomed. In vain, in vain he
courted repose; in vain, in vain he had recourse to every expedient to wile himself to slumber.
Each minute he started from his pillow with some phrase which reminded him of his late fearful
society. Hour after hour moved on with its leaden pace; each hour he heard strike, and each
hour seemed an age. Each hour was only a signal to cast off some covering, or shift his position.
It was, at length, morning. With a feeling that he should go mad if he remained any longer
in bed, he rose, and paced his chamber. The air refreshed him. He threw himself on the floor;
the cold crept over his senses, and he slept.

LXVI. THE PICKWICKIANS DISPORT THEMSELVES ON ICE.[O]

CHARLES DICKENS.--1812-1870.

From THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK CLUB.

"Now," said Wardle, after a substantial lunch had been done ample justice to; "what say you
to an hour on the ice? We shall have plenty of time."

"Capital!" said Mr. Benjamin Allen.

"Prime!" ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer.

"You skate, of course, Winkle?" said Wardle.

"Ye-yes; oh, yes," replied Mr. Winkle. "I--I--am rather out of practice."

"Oh, do skate, Mr. Winkle," said Arabella. "I like to see it so much."

"Oh, it is so graceful," said another young lady.

A third young lady said it was elegant, and a fourth expressed her opinion that it was "swan-like."

"I should be very happy, I'm sure," said Mr. Winkle, reddening; "but I have no skates."

This objection was at once over-ruled. Trundle had a couple of pair, and the fat boy announced
that there were half a dozen more down stairs: whereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight,
and looked exquisitely uncomfortable.

Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the fat boy and Mr. Weller, having
shovelled and swept away the snow which had fallen on it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted
his skates with a dexterity which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and described circles
with his left leg, and cut figures of eight, and inscribed upon the ice, without once stopping
for breath, a great many other pleasant and astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction
of Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman, and the ladies: which reached a pitch of positive enthusiasm,
when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the aforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some mystic
evolutions, which they called a reel.

All this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue with the cold, had been forcing a gimlet
into the soles of his feet, and putting his skates on, with the points behind, and getting
the straps into a very complicated and entangled state, with the assistance of Mr. Snodgrass,
who knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo. At length, however, with the assistance of
Mr. Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised
to his feet.

"Now, then, sir," said Sam, in an encouraging tone; "off vith you, and show 'em how to do it."

"Stop, Sam, stop!" said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently, and clutching hold of Sam's arms with
the grasp of a drowning man. "How slippery it is, Sam!"

"Not an uncommon thing upon ice, sir," replied Mr. Weller. "Hold up, sir!"

This last observation of Mr. Weller's bore reference to a demonstration Mr. Winkle made at
the instant, of a frantic desire to throw his feet in the air, and dash the back of his head
on the ice.

"These--these--are very awkward skates; ain't they, Sam?" inquired Mr. Winkle, staggering.

"I'm afeerd there's a orkard gen'l'm'n in 'em, sir," replied Sam.

"Now, Winkle," cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that there was anything the matter. "Come;
the ladies are all anxiety."

"Yes, yes," replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. "I'm coming."

"Just a goin' to begin," said Sam, endeavoring to disengage himself. "Now, sir, start off!"

"Stop an instant, Sam," gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging most affectionately to Mr. Weller. "I find
I've got a couple of coats at home that I don't want, Sam. You may have them, Sam."

"Thank'ee, sir," replied Mr. Weller.

"Never mind touching your hat, Sam," said Mr. Winkle, hastily. "You needn't take your hand
away to do that. I meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a Christmas-box,
Sam. I'll give it you this afternoon, Sam."

"You're wery good, sir," replied Mr. Weller.

"Just hold me at first, Sam; will you?" said Mr. Winkle. "There--that's right. I shall soon
get in the way of it, Sam. Not too fast, Sam; not too fast."

Mr. Winkle stooping forward, with his body half doubled up, was being assisted over the ice
by Mr. Weller, in a very singular and un-swan-like manner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently
shouted from the opposite bank:

"Sam!"

"Sir?"

"Here. I want you."

"Let go, sir," said Sam. "Don't you hear the governor a callin'? Let go, sir."

With a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself from the grasp of the agonized Pickwickian,
and, in so doing, administered a considerable impetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle. With an accuracy
which no degree of dexterity or practice could have insured, that unfortunate gentleman bore
swiftly down into the centre of the reel, at the very moment when Mr. Bob Sawyer was performing
a flourish of unparalleled beauty. Mr. Winkle struck wildly against him, and with a loud crash
they both fell heavily down. Mr. Pickwick ran to the spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to his feet,
but Mr. Winkle was far too wise to do anything of the kind, in skates. He was seated on the
ice, making spasmodic efforts to smile; but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his
countenance.

"Are you hurt?" inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with great anxiety.

"Not much," said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very hard.

"I wish you'd let me bleed you," said Mr. Benjamin, with great eagerness.

"No, thank you," replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly.

"I really think you had better," said Allen.

"Thank you," replied Mr. Winkle; "I'd rather not."

"What do you think, Mr. Pickwick?" inquired Bob Sawyer.

Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr. Weller, and said in a stern voice,
"Take his skates off."

"No; but really I had scarcely begun," remonstrated Mr. Winkle.

"Take his skates off," repeated Mr. Pickwick firmly.

The command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle allowed Sam to obey it in silence.

"Lift him up," said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to rise.

Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders; and beckoning his friend to approach,
fixed a searching look upon him, and uttered in a low, but distinct and emphatic tone, these
remarkable words:

"You're a humbug, sir."

"A what?" said Mr. Winkle, starting.

"A humbug, sir. I will speak plainer, if you wish it. An impostor, sir."

With these words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel, and rejoined his friends.

While Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment just recorded, Mr. Weller and the
fat boy, having by their joint endeavors cut out a slide, were exercising themselves thereupon,
in a very masterly and brilliant manner. Sam Weller, in particular, was displaying that beautiful
feat of fancy-sliding which is currently denominated "knocking at the cobbler's door," and
which is achieved by skimming over the ice on one foot, and occasionally giving a postman's
knock upon it with the other. It was a good long slide, and there was something in the motion
which Mr. Pickwick, who was very cold with standing still, could not help envying.

"It looks a nice warm exercise that, doesn't it?" he inquired of Wardle, when that gentleman
was thoroughly out of breath, by reason of the indefatigable manner in which he had converted
his legs into a pair of compasses, and drawn complicated problems on the ice.

"Ah, it does indeed," replied Wardle. "Do you slide?"

"I used to do so on the gutters, when I was a boy," replied Mr. Pickwick.

"Try it now," said Wardle.

"Oh do, please, Mr. Pickwick!" cried all the ladies.

"I should be very happy to afford you any amusement," replied Mr. Pickwick, "but I haven't
done such a thing these thirty years."

"Pooh! pooh! Nonsense!" said Wardle, dragging off his skates with the impetuosity which characterized
all his proceedings. "Here; I'll keep you company; come along!" And away went the good tempered
old fellow down the slide, with a rapidity which came very close upon Mr. Weller, and beat
the fat boy all to nothing.

Mr. Pickwick paused, considered, pulled off his gloves and put them in his hat: took two or
three short runs, baulked himself as often, and at last took another run, and went slowly and
gravely down the slide, with his feet about a yard and a quarter apart, amidst the gratified
shouts of all the spectators.

"Keep the pot a bilin', sir!" said Sam; and down went Wardle again, and then Mr. Pickwick,
and then Sam, and then Mr. Winkle, and then Mr. Bob Sawyer, and then the fat boy, and then
Mr. Snodgrass, following closely upon each other's heels, and running after each other with
as much eagerness as if all their future prospects in life depended on their expedition.

It was the most intensely interesting thing, to observe the manner in which Mr. Pickwick performed
his share in the ceremony; to watch the torture of anxiety with which he viewed the person
behind, gaining upon him at the imminent hazard of tripping him up; to see him gradually expend
the painful force he had put on at first, and turn slowly round on the slide, with his face
towards the point from which he had started; to contemplate the playful smile which mantled
on his face when he had accomplished the distance, and the eagerness with which he turned round
when he had done so, and ran after his predecessor: his black gaiters tripping pleasantly through
the snow, and his eyes beaming cheerfulness and gladness through his spectacles. And when he
was knocked down (which happened upon the average every third round), it was the most invigorating
sight that can possibly be imagined, to behold him gather up his hat, gloves, and handkerchief,
with a glowing countenance, and resume his station in the rank, with an ardor and enthusiasm
that nothing could abate.

The sport was at its height, the sliding was at the quickest, the laughter was at the loudest,
when a sharp smart crack was heard. There was a quick rush towards the bank, a wild scream
from the ladies, and a shout from Mr. Tupman. A large mass of ice disappeared; the water bubbled
up over it; Mr. Pickwick's hat, gloves, and handkerchief were floating on the surface; and
this was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody could see.

Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance, the males turned pale, and the females
fainted, Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle grasped each other by the hand, and gazed at the spot
where their leader had gone down, with frenzied eagerness: while Mr. Tupman, by way of rendering
the promptest assistance, and at the same time conveying to any persons who might be within
hearing, the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe, ran off across the country at his
utmost speed, screaming "Fire!" with all his might.

It was at this moment, when old Wardle and Sam Weller were approaching the hole with cautious
steps, and Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried consultation with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the
advisability of bleeding the company generally, as an improving little bit of professional
practice--it was at this very moment, that a face, head, and shoulders, emerged from beneath
the water, and disclosed the features and spectacles of Mr. Pickwick.

"Keep yourself up for an instant--for only one instant!" bawled Mr. Snodgrass.

"Yes, do; let me implore you--for my sake!" roared Mr. Winkle, deeply affected. The adjuration
was rather unnecessary; the probability being, that if Mr. Pickwick had declined to keep himself
up for anybody else's sake, it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so, for his own.

"Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow?" said Wardle.

"Yes, certainly," replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the water from his head and face, and gasping
for breath. "I fell upon my back. I couldn't get on my feet at first."

The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick's coat as was yet visible, bore testimony to the accuracy
of this statement; and as the fears of the spectators were still further relieved by the fat
boy's suddenly recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep, prodigies
of valor were performed to get him out. After a vast quantity of splashing, and cracking, and
struggling, Mr. Pickwick was at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position, and
once more stood on dry land.

"Oh, he'll catch his death of cold," said Emily.

"Dear old thing!" said Arabella. "Let me wrap this shawl round you, Mr. Pickwick."

"Ah, that's the best thing you can do," said Wardle; "and when you've got it on, run home as
fast as your legs can carry you, and jump into bed directly."

A dozen shawls were offered on the instant. Three or four of the thickest having been selected,
Mr. Pickwick was wrapped up, and started off, under the guidance of Mr. Weller: presenting
the singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman, dripping wet, and without a hat, with his
arms bound down to his sides, skimming over the ground, without any clearly defined purpose,
at the rate of six good English miles an hour.

But Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case, and urged on by Sam Weller,
he kept at the very top of his speed until he reached the door of Manor Farm, where Mr. Tupman
had arrived some five minutes before, and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of
the heart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen chimney was on
fire--a calamity which always presented itself in glowing colors to the old lady's mind, when
anybody about her evinced the smallest agitation.

Mr. Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed. Sam Weller lighted a blazing fire
in his room, and took up his dinner, and afterwards a great rejoicing was held in honor of
his safety.

FOOTNOTES:

[O] MR. PICKWICK, a benevolent, simple-minded old gentleman, is the founder of the Pickwick
Club. He and three other members, Mr. Winkle, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr. Tupman, form the Corresponding
Society of the club, and they travel over England together, meeting with many laughable adventures.
They are accompanied by Samuel Weller, Mr. Pickwick's servant, an inimitable compound of cool
impudence, quaint humor, and fidelity. The Pickwickians have accepted the invitation of Mr.
Wardle, of Manor Farm, Dingley Dell, to be present at the marriage of his daughter, Isabella,
to Mr. Trundle. Among the guests are also Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen, two medical
students, and Mr. Allen's sister, Arabella. Other members of Mr. Wardle's household are Mr.
Wardle's mother, the "old lady" of Manor Farm, his daughter, Emily, and Joe, a servant lad,
known as the "fat boy." The wedding takes place on the twenty-third of December, and then follow
the Christmas festivities, of which the skating forms a part.

LXVII. THE HANGING OF THE CRANE.

HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.--1807-1882.

I.

    The lights are out, and gone are all the guests
    That thronging came with merriment and jests
      To celebrate the Hanging of the Crane
    In the new house,--into the night are gone;
    But still the fire upon the hearth burns on,
        And I alone remain.

        O fortunate, O happy day,
        When a new household finds its place
        Among the myriad homes of earth,
        Like a new star just sprung to birth,
        And roll'd on its harmonious way
        Into the boundless realms of space!
        So said the guests in speech and song,
        As in the chimney, burning bright,
        We hung the iron crane to-night,
        And merry was the feast and long.

II.

    And now I sit and muse on what may be,
    And in my vision see, or seem to see,
      Through floating vapors interfused with light,
    Shapes indeterminate, that gleam and fade,
    As shadows passing into deeper shade
        Sink and elude the sight.

        For two alone, there in the hall,
        Is spread the table round and small;
        Upon the polish'd silver shine
        The evening lamps, but, more divine,
        The light of love shines over all;
        Of love, that says not mine and thine,
        But ours, for ours is thine and mine.

        They want no guests, to come between
        Their tender glances like a screen,
        And tell them tales of land and sea,
        And whatsoever may betide
        The great, forgotten world outside;
        They want no guests; they needs must be
        Each other's own best company.

III.

    The picture fades; as at a village fair
    A showman's views, dissolving into air,
      Again appear transfigured on the screen,
    So in my fancy this; and now once more,
    In part transfigured, through the open door
        Appears the selfsame scene.

        Seated, I see the two again,
        But not alone; they entertain
        A little angel unaware,
        With face as round as is the moon;
        A royal guest with flaxen hair,
        Who, throned upon his lofty chair,
        Drums on the table with his spoon,
        Then drops it careless on the floor,
        To grasp at things unseen before.

        Are these celestial manners? these
        The ways that win, the arts that please?
        Ah yes; consider well the guest,
        And whatsoe'er he does seems best;
        He ruleth by the right divine
        Of helplessness, so lately born
        In purple chambers of the morn,
        As sovereign over thee and thine.
        He speaketh not; and yet there lies
        A conversation in his eyes;
        The golden silence of the Greek,
        The gravest wisdom of the wise,
        Not spoken in language, but in looks
        More legible than printed books,
        As if he could but would not speak.
        And now, O monarch absolute,
        Thy power is put to proof; for, lo!
        Resistless, fathomless, and slow,
        The nurse comes rustling like the sea,
        And pushes back thy chair and thee,
        And so good night to King Canute.

IV.

    As one who walking in a forest sees
    A lovely landscape through the parted trees,
      Then sees it not, for boughs that intervene;
    Or, as we see the moon sometimes reveal'd
    Through drifting clouds, and then again conceal'd,
        So I behold the scene.

        There are two guests at table now;
        The king, deposed and older grown,
        No longer occupies the throne,--
        The crown is on his sister's brow;
        A Princess from the Fairy Isles,
        The very pattern girl of girls,
        All cover'd and embower'd in curls,
        Rose-tinted from the Isle of Flowers,
        And sailing with soft, silken sails
        From far-off Dreamland into ours.
        Above their bowls with rims of blue
        Four azure eyes of deeper hue
        Are looking, dreamy with delight;
        Limpid as planets that emerge
        Above the ocean's rounded verge,
        Soft-shining through the summer night.
        Steadfast they gaze, yet nothing see
        Beyond the horizon of their bowls;
        Nor care they for the world that rolls
        With all its freight of troubled souls
        Into the days that are to be.

V.

    Again the tossing boughs shut out the scene,
    Again the drifting vapors intervene,
      And the moon's pallid disk is hidden quite:
    And now I see the table wider grown,
    As round a pebble into water thrown
        Dilates a ring of light.

        I see the table wider grown,
        I see it garlanded with guests,
        As if fair Ariadne's Crown
        Out of the sky had fallen down;
        Maidens within whose tender breasts
        A thousand restless hopes and fears,
        Forth reaching to the coming years,
        Flutter awhile, then quiet lie,
        Like timid birds that fain would fly,
        But do not dare to leave their nests;--
        And youths, who in their strength elate
        Challenge the van and front of fate,
        Eager as champions to be
        In the divine knight-errantry
        Of youth, that travels sea and land
        Seeking adventures, or pursues,
        Through cities, and through solitudes
        Frequented by the lyric Muse,
        The phantom with the beckoning hand,
        That still allures and still eludes.
        O sweet illusions of the brain!
        O sudden thrills of fire and frost!
        The world is bright while ye remain,
        And dark and dead when ye are lost!

VI.

    The meadow-brook, that seemeth to stand still,
    Quickens its current as it nears the mill;
      And so the stream of Time that lingereth
    In level places, and so dull appears,
    Runs with a swifter current as it nears
      The gloomy mills of Death.

        And now, like the magician's scroll,
        That in the owner's keeping shrinks
        With every wish he speaks or thinks,
        Till the last wish consumes the whole,
        The table dwindles, and again
        I see the two alone remain.
        The crown of stars is broken in parts;
        Its jewels, brighter than the day,
        Have one by one been stolen away
        To shine in other homes and hearts.
        One is a wanderer now afar
        In Ceylon or in Zanzibar,
        Or sunny regions of Cathay;
        And one is in the boisterous camp
        Mid clink of arms and horses' tramp,
        And battle's terrible array.
        I see the patient mother read,
        With aching heart, of wrecks that float
        Disabled on those seas remote,
        Or of some great heroic deed
        On battle-fields, where thousands bleed
        To lift one hero into fame.
        Anxious she bends her graceful head
        Above these chronicles of pain,
        And trembles with a secret dread
        Lest there among the drown'd or slain
        She find the one belovèd name.

VII.

    After a day of cloud and wind and rain
    Sometimes the setting sun breaks out again,
      And, touching all the darksome woods with light.
    Smiles on the fields, until they laugh and sing,
    Then like a ruby from the horizon's ring
        Drops down into the night.

        What see I now? The night is fair,
        The storm of grief, the clouds of care,
        The wind, the rain, have pass'd away;
        The lamps are lit, the fires burn bright,
        The house is full of life and light:
        It is the Golden Wedding day.
        The guests come thronging in once more,
        Quick footsteps sound along the floor,
        The trooping children crowd the stair,
        And in and out and everywhere
        Flashes along the corridor
        The sunshine of their golden hair.

        On the round table in the hall
        Another Ariadne's Crown
        Out of the sky hath fallen down;
        More than one Monarch of the Moon
        Is drumming with his silver spoon;
        The light of love shines over all.

        O fortunate, O happy day!
        The people sing, the people say.
        The ancient bridegroom and the bride,
        Smiling contented and serene,
        Upon the blithe, bewildering scene,
        Behold, well pleas'd, on every side
        Their forms and features multiplied,
        As the reflection of a light
        Between two burnish'd mirrors gleams,
        Or lamps upon a bridge at night
        Stretch on and on before the sight,
        Till the long vista endless seems.

LXVIII. EARTHWORMS.

CHARLES DARWIN--1809-1882.

From THE FORMATION OF VEGETABLE MOULD THROUGH THE ACTION OF WORMS.

Worms have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would
at first suppose. In almost all humid countries they are extraordinarily numerous, and for
their size possess great muscular power. In many parts of England a weight of more than ten
tons of dry earth annually passes through their bodies and is brought to the surface on each
acre of land; so that the whole superficial bed of vegetable mould passes through their bodies
in the course of every few years. From the collapsing of the old burrows the mould is in constant
though slow movement, and the particles composing it are thus rubbed together. By these means
fresh surfaces are continually exposed to the action of the carbonic acid in the soil, and
of the humus-acids which appear to be still more efficient in the decomposition of rocks. The
generation of the humus-acids is probably hastened during the digestion of the many half-decayed
leaves which worms consume. Thus the particles of earth, forming the superficial mould, are
subjected to conditions eminently favorable for their decomposition and disintegration. Moreover,
the particles of the softer rocks suffer some amount of mechanical trituration in the muscular
gizzards of worms, in which small stones serve as mill-stones....

Archæologists ought to be grateful to worms, as they protect and preserve for an indefinitely
long period every object, not liable to decay, which is dropped on the surface of the land,
by burying it beneath their castings. Thus, also, many elegant and curious tesselated pavements
and other ancient remains have been preserved; though no doubt the worms have in these cases
been largely aided by earth washed and blown from the adjoining land, especially when cultivated.
The old tesselated pavements have, however, often suffered by having subsided unequally from
being unequally undermined by the worms. Even old massive walls may be undermined and subside;
and no building is in this respect safe, unless the foundations lie six or seven feet beneath
the surface, at a depth at which worms cannot work. It is probable that many monoliths and
some old walls have fallen down from having been undermined by worms.

Worms prepare the ground in an excellent manner for the growth of fibrous-rooted plants and
for seedlings of all kinds. They periodically expose the mould to the air, and sift it so that
no stones larger than the particles which they can swallow are left in it. They mingle the
whole intimately together, like a gardener who prepares fine soil for his choicest plants.
In this state it is well fitted to retain moisture and to absorb all soluble substances, as
well as for the process of nitrification. The bones of dead animals, the harder parts of insects,
the shells of land-molluscs, leaves, twigs, etc., are before long all buried beneath the accumulated
castings of worms, and are thus brought in a more or less decayed state within reach of the
roots of plants. Worms likewise drag an infinite number of dead leaves and other parts of plants
into their burrows, partly for the sake of plugging them up and partly as food.

The leaves which are dragged into the burrows as food, after being torn into the finest shreds,
partially digested, and saturated with the intestinal secretions, are commingled with much
earth. This earth forms the dark-colored, rich humus which almost everywhere covers the surface
of the land with a fairly well-defined layer or mantle. Von Hensen placed two worms in a vessel
eighteen inches in diameter, which was filled with sand, on which fallen leaves were strewed;
and these were soon dragged into their burrows to a depth of three inches. After about six
weeks an almost uniform layer of sand, a centimetre (.4 inch) in thickness, was converted into
humus by having passed through the alimentary canals of these two worms. It is believed by
some persons that worm-burrows, which often penetrate the ground almost perpendicularly to
a depth of five or six feet, materially aid in its drainage; notwithstanding that the viscid
castings piled over the mouths of the burrows prevent or check the rain-water directly entering
them. They allow the air to penetrate deeply into the ground. They also greatly facilitate
the downward passage of roots of moderate size; and these will be nourished by the humus with
which the burrows are lined. Many seeds owe their germination to having been covered by castings;
and others buried to a considerable depth beneath accumulated castings lie dormant, until at
some future time they are accidentally uncovered and germinate.

Worms are poorly provided with sense-organs, for they cannot be said to see, although they
can just distinguish between light and darkness; they are completely deaf, and have only a
feeble power of smell; the sense of touch alone is well developed. They can therefore learn
little about the outside world, and it is surprising that they should exhibit some skill in
lining their burrows with their castings and with leaves, and in the case of some species in
piling up their castings into tower-like constructions. But it is far more surprising that
they should apparently exhibit some degree of intelligence instead of a mere blind instinctive
impulse, in their manner of plugging up the mouths of their burrows. They act in nearly the
same manner as would a man, who had to close a cylindrical tube with different kinds of leaves,
petioles, triangles of paper, etc., for they commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends.
But with thin objects a certain number are drawn in by their broader ends. They do not act
in the same unvarying manner in all cases, as do most of the lower animals; for instance, they
do not drag in leaves by their foot-stalks, unless the basal part of the blade is as narrow
as the apex, or narrower than it.

When we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we should remember that its smoothness, on which
so much of its beauty depends, is mainly due to all the inequalities having been slowly levelled
by worms. It is a marvellous reflection that the whole of the superficial mould over any such
expanse has passed, and will again pass, every few years, through the bodies of worms. The
plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable of man's inventions; but long before he
existed the land was in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to be thus ploughed by
earth-worms. It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important
a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures.

LXIX. "AS SHIPS, BECALMED AT EVE."

ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH.--1819-1861.

    As ships, becalm'd at eve, that lay
      With canvas drooping, side by side,
    Two towers of sail at dawn of day
      Are scarce long leagues apart descried;

    When fell the night, upsprung the breeze,
      And all the darkling hours they plied,
    Nor dreamt but each the self-same seas
      By each was cleaving, side by side:

    E'en so--but why the tale reveal
      Of those, whom year by year unchanged,
    Brief absence join'd anew to feel,
      Astounded, soul from soul estranged?

    At dead of night their sails were fill'd,
      And onward each rejoicing steer'd--
    Ah, neither blame, for neither will'd,
      Or wist, what first with dawn appear'd!

    To veer, how vain! On, onward strain,
      Brave barks! In light, in darkness too,
    Through winds and tides one compass guides--
      To that, and your own selves, be true.

    But O blithe breeze! and O great seas,
      Though ne'er, that earliest parting past,
    On your wide plain they join again,
      Together lead them home at last.

    One port, methought, alike they sought,
      One purpose hold where'er they fare,--
    O bounding breeze, O rushing seas!
      At last, at last, unite them there.

LXX. DUTY.

ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH.

    Duty--that's to say, complying
      With whate'er's expected here;
    On your unknown cousin's dying,
      Straight be ready with the tear;
    Upon etiquette relying,
    Unto usage nought denying,
    Lend your waist to be embraced,
      Blush not even, never fear;
    Claims of kith and kin connection,
      Claims of manners honor still,
    Ready money of affection
      Pay, whoever drew the bill.
    With the form conforming duly,
    Senseless what it meaneth truly,
    Go to church--the world require you,
      To balls--the world require you too,
    And marry--papa and mamma desire you,
      And your sisters and schoolfellows do.

    Duty--'tis to take on trust
    What things are good, and right, and just;
      And whether indeed they be or be not,
      Try not, test not, feel not, see not:
      'Tis walk and dance, sit down and rise
      By leading, opening ne'er your eyes;
    Stunt sturdy limbs that Nature gave,
    And be drawn in a Bath chair along to the grave.

    'Tis the stern and prompt suppressing,
      As an obvious deadly sin,
    All the questing and the guessing
      Of the soul's own soul within:
        'Tis the coward acquiescence
          In a destiny's behest,
        To a shade by terror made,
        Sacrificing, aye, the essence
          Of all that's truest, noblest, best:
        'Tis the blind non-recognition
          Or of goodness, truth, or beauty,
        Save by precept and submission;
          Moral blank, and moral void,
          Life at very birth destroy'd.
        Atrophy, exinanition!
        Duty!
        Yea, by duty's prime condition
          Pure nonentity of duty!

LXXI. SONNETS.

CHARLES HEAVYSEGE.--1816-1876.

I.

    The day was lingering in the pale north-west,
    And night was hanging o'er my head,--
    Night where a myriad stars were spread;
    While down in the east, where the light was least,
    Seem'd the home of the quiet dead.
    And, as I gazed on the field sublime,
    To watch the bright, pulsating stars,
    Adown the deep where the angels sleep
    Came drawn the golden chime
    Of those great spheres that sound the years
    For the horologe of time.
    Millenniums numberless they told,
    Millenniums a million-fold
    From the ancient hour of prime.

II.

    The stars are glittering in the frosty sky,
    Frequent as pebbles on a broad sea-coast;
    And o'er the vault the cloud-like galaxy
    Has marshall'd its innumerable host.
    Alive all heaven seems! with wondrous glow
    Tenfold refulgent every star appears,
    As if some wide, celestial gale did blow,
    And thrice illume the ever-kindled spheres.
    Orbs, with glad orbs rejoicing, burning, beam,
    Ray-crown'd, with lambent lustre in their zones,
    Till o'er the blue, bespangled spaces seem
    Angels and great archangels on their thrones;
    A host divine, whose eyes are sparkling gems,
    And forms more bright than diamond diadems.

III.

    Hush'd in a calm beyond mine utterance,
    See in the western sky the evening spread;
    Suspended in its pale, serene expanse,
    Like scatter'd flames, the glowing cloudlets red.
    Clear are those clouds; and that pure sky's profound,
    Transparent as a lake of hyaline;
    Nor motion, nor the faintest breath of sound,
    Disturbs the steadfast beauty of the scene.
    Far o'er the vault, the winnow'd welkin wide,
    From the bronzed east unto the whiten'd west,
    Moor'd, seem, in their sweet, tranquil, roseate pride,
    Those clouds the fabled islands of the blest;--
    The lands where pious spirits breathe in joy,
    And love and worship all their hours employ.

LXXII. DOCTOR ARNOLD AT RUGBY.

ARTHUR PENRHYN STANLEY.--1815-1880.

With his usual and undoubting confidence in what he believed to be a general law of Providence,
he based his whole management of the school on his early-formed and yearly-increasing conviction
that what he had to look for, both intellectually and morally, was not performance but promise;
that the very freedom and independence of school life, which in itself he thought so dangerous,
might be made the best preparation for Christian manhood; and he did not hesitate to apply
to his scholars the principle which seemed to him to have been adopted in the training of the
childhood of the human race itself. He shrunk from pressing on the conscience of boys rules
of action which he felt they were not yet able to bear, and from enforcing actions which, though
right in themselves, would in boys be performed from wrong motives. Keenly as he felt the risk
and fatal consequences of the failure of this trial, still it was his great, sometimes his
only support to believe that "the character is braced amid such scenes to a greater beauty
and firmness than it ever can attain without enduring and witnessing them. Our work here would
be absolutely unendurable if we did not bear in mind that we should look forward as well as
backward--if we did not remember that the victory of fallen man lies not in innocence but in
tried virtue." "I hold fast," he said, "to the great truth, that 'blessed is he that overcometh;'"
and he writes in 1837: "Of all the painful things connected with my employment, nothing is
equal to the grief of seeing a boy come to school innocent and promising, and tracing the corruption
of his character from the influence of the temptations around him, in the very place which
ought to have strengthened and improved it. But in most cases those who come with a character
of positive good are benefited; it is the neutral and indecisive characters which are apt to
be decided for evil by schools, as they would be in fact by any other temptation."

But this very feeling led him with the greater eagerness to catch at every means by which the
trial might be shortened or alleviated. "Can the change from childhood to manhood be hastened,
without prematurely exhausting the faculties of body or mind?" was one of the chief questions
on which his mind was constantly at work, and which in the judgment of some he was disposed
to answer too readily in the affirmative. It was with the elder boys, of course, that he chiefly
acted on this principle, but with all above the very young ones he trusted to it more or less.
Firmly as he believed that a time of trial was inevitable, he believed no less firmly that
it might be passed at public schools sooner than under other circumstances; and, in proportion
as he disliked the assumption of a false manliness in boys, was his desire to cultivate in
them true manliness, as the only step to something higher, and to dwell on earnest principle
and moral thoughtfulness, as the great and distinguishing mark between good and evil. Hence
his wish that as much as possible should be done by the boys, and nothing for them; hence arose
his practice, in which his own delicacy of feeling and uprightness of purpose powerfully assisted
him, of treating the boys as gentlemen and reasonable beings, of making them respect themselves
by the mere respect he showed to them; of showing that he appealed and trusted to their own
common sense and conscience. Lying, for example, to the masters, he made a great moral offence:
placing implicit confidence in a boy's assertion, and then, if a falsehood was discovered,
punishing it severely,--in the upper part of the school, when persisted in, with expulsion.
Even with the lower forms he never seemed to be on the watch for boys; and in the higher forms
any attempt at further proof of an assertion was immediately checked: "If you say so, that
is quite enough--of course I believe your word;" and there grew up in consequence a general
feeling that "it was a shame to tell Arnold a lie--he always believes one."

Perhaps the liveliest representation of this general spirit, as distinguished from its exemplification
in particular parts of the discipline and instruction, would be formed by recalling his manner,
as he appeared in the great school, where the boys used to meet when the whole school was assembled
collectively, and not in its different forms or classes. Then, whether on his usual entrance
every morning to prayers before the first lesson, or on the more special emergencies which
might require his presence, he seemed to stand before them, not merely as the head-master,
but as the representative of the school. There he spoke to them as members together with himself
of the same great institution, whose character and reputation they had to sustain as well as
he. He would dwell on the satisfaction he had in being head of a society, where noble and honorable
feelings were encouraged, or on the disgrace which he felt in hearing of acts of disorder or
violence, such as in the humbler ranks of life would render them amenable to the laws of their
country; or again, on the trust which he placed in their honor as gentlemen, and the baseness
of any instance in which it was abused. "Is this a Christian school?" he indignantly asked
at the end of one of those addresses, in which he had spoken of an extensive display of bad
feeling amongst the boys; and then added,--"I cannot remain here if all this is to be carried
on by constraint and force; if I am to be here as a jailer, I will resign my office at once."
And few scenes can be recorded more characteristic of him than on one of these occasions, when,
in consequence of a disturbance, he had been obliged to send away several boys, and when in
the midst of the general spirit of discontent which this excited, he stood in his place before
the assembled school and said: "It is not necessary that this should be a school of three hundred,
or one hundred, or of fifty boys; but it is necessary that it should be a school of Christian
gentlemen."

LXXIII. ODE TO THE NORTH-EAST WIND.

CHARLES KINGSLEY.--1819-1875.

    Welcome, wild North-easter!
      Shame it is to see
    Odes to every zephyr;
      Ne'er a verse to thee.
    Welcome, black North-easter!
      O'er the German foam;
    O'er the Danish moorlands,
      From thy frozen home.
    Tired we are of summer,
      Tired of gaudy glare,
    Showers soft and steaming,
      Hot and breathless air.
    Tired of listless dreaming
      Through the lazy day:
    Jovial wind of winter
      Turns us out to play!
    Sweep the golden reed-beds;
      Crisp the lazy dyke;
    Hunger into madness
      Every plunging pike.
    Fill the lake with wild-fowl;
      Fill the marsh with snipe;
    While on dreary moorlands
      Lonely curlew pipe.
    Through the black fir-forest
      Thunder harsh and dry,
    Shattering down the snow-flakes
      Off the curdled sky.
    Hark! The brave North-easter!
      Breast-high lies the scent,
    On by holt and headland,
      Over heath and bent.
    Chime, ye dappled darlings,
      Through the sleet and snow.
    Who can over-ride you?
      Let the horses go!
    Chime, ye dappled darlings,
      Down the roaring blast;
    You shall see a fox die
      Ere an hour be past.
    Go! and rest to-morrow,
      Hunting in your dreams,
    While our skates are ringing
      O'er the frozen streams.
    Let the luscious South-wind
      Breathe in lovers' sighs,
    While the lazy gallants
      Bask in ladies' eyes.
    What does he but soften
      Heart alike and pen?
    'Tis the hard grey weather
      Breeds hard English men.
    What's the soft South-wester?
      'Tis the ladies' breeze,
    Bringing home their true-loves
      Out of all the seas.
    But the black North-easter,
      Through the snow-storm hurl'd,
    Drives our English hearts of oak
      Seaward round the world.
    Come, as came our fathers,
      Heralded by thee,
    Conquering from the eastward,
      Lords by land and sea.
    Come; and strong within us
      Stir the Vikings' blood,
    Bracing brain and sinew;
      Blow, thou wind of God!

LXXIV. FROM "THE MILL ON THE FLOSS."

GEORGE ELIOT.--1820-1880.

It was one of their happy mornings. They trotted along and sat down together, with no thought
that life would ever change much for them: they would only get bigger and not go to school,
and it would always be like the holidays; they would always live together and be fond of each
other. And the mill with its booming--the great chestnut-tree under which they played at houses--their
own little river, the Ripple, where the banks seemed like home, and Tom was always seeing the
water-rats, while Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the reeds, which she forgot and
dropped afterward--above all, the great Floss, along which they wandered with a sense of travel,
to see the rushing spring-tide, the awful Eagre, come up like a hungry monster, or to see the
Great Ash which had once wailed and groaned like a man--these things would always be just the
same to them. Tom thought people were at a disadvantage who lived on any other spot of the
globe; and Maggie, when she read about Christiana passing "the river over which there is no
bridge," always saw the Floss between the green pastures by the Great Ash.

Life did change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they were not wrong in believing that the thoughts
and loves of these first years would always make part of their lives. We could never have loved
the earth so well if we had had no childhood in it--if it were not the earth where the same
flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping
to ourselves on the grass--the same hips and haws on the autumn hedgerows--the same red-breasts
that we used to call "God's birds," because they did no harm to the precious crops. What novelty
is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known, and loved because it is known?

The wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the young yellow-brown foliage of the oaks between
me and the blue sky, the white star-flowers, and the blue-eyed speedwell, and the ground-ivy
at my feet--what grove of tropic palms, what strange ferns or splendid broad-petaled blossoms,
could ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres within me as this home-scene? These familiar
flowers, these well-remembered bird-notes, this sky with its fitful brightness, these furrowed
and grassy fields, each with a sort of personality given to it by the capricious hedgerows--such
things as these are the mother tongue of our imagination, the language that is laden with all
the subtle inextricable associations the fleeting hours of our childhood left behind them.
Our delight in the sunshine on the deep-bladed grass to-day might be no more than the faint
perception of wearied souls, if it were not for the sunshine and the grass in the far-off years,
which still live in us, and transform our perception into love.

LXXV. THE CLOUD CONFINES.

DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.--1828-1882.

    The day is dark and the night
      To him that would search their heart;
      No lips of cloud that will part
    Nor morning song in the light:
      Only, gazing alone,
      To him wild shadows are shown,
      Deep under deep unknown
    And height above unknown height.
            Still we say as we go,--
              "Strange to think by the way,
            Whatever there is to know,
              That shall we know one day."

    The Past is over and fled;
      Named new, we name it the old;
      Thereof some tale hath been told,
    But no word comes from the dead;
      Whether at all they be,
      Or whether as bond or free,
      Or whether they too were we,
    Or by what spell they have sped.
            Still we say as we go,--
              "Strange to think by the way,
            Whatever there is to know,
              That shall we know one day."

    What of the heart of hate
      That beats in thy breast, O Time?--
      Red strife from the furthest prime,
    And anguish of fierce debate;
      War that shatters her slain,
      And peace that grinds them as grain,
      And eyes fix'd ever in vain
    On the pitiless eyes of Fate.
            Still we say as we go,--
              "Strange to think by the way,
            Whatever there is to know,
              That shall we know one day."

    What of the heart of love
      That bleeds in thy breast, O Man?--
      Thy kisses snatch'd 'neath the ban
    Of fangs that mock them above;
      Thy bells prolong'd unto knells,
      Thy hope that a breath dispels,
      Thy bitter forlorn farewells
    And the empty echoes thereof?
            Still we say as we go,--
              "Strange to think by the way,
            Whatever there is to know,
              That shall we know one day."

    The sky leans dumb on the sea,
      Aweary with all its wings;
      And oh! the song the sea sings
    Is dark everlastingly.
      Our past is clean forgot,
      Our present is and is not,
      Our future's a seal'd seedplot,
    And what betwixt them are we?--
            We who say as we go,--
              "Strange to think by the way,
            Whatever there is to know,
              That shall we know one day."

LXXVI. BARBARA FRIETCHIE.

JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.--1807-

    Up from the meadows rich with corn,
    Clear in the cool September morn,

    The cluster'd spires of Frederick stand
    Green-wall'd by the hills of Maryland.

    Round about them orchards sweep,
    Apple and peach tree fruited deep,--

    Fair as a garden of the Lord
    To the eyes of the famish'd rebel horde,

    On that pleasant morn of the early fall
    When Lee march'd over the mountain wall,--

    Over the mountains winding down,
    Horse and foot, into Frederick town.

    Forty flags with their silver stars,
    Forty flags with their crimson bars,

    Flapp'd in the morning wind: the sun
    Of noon look'd down, and saw not one.

    Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
    Bow'd with her fourscore years and ten;

    Bravest of all in Frederick town,
    She took up the flag the men haul'd down;

    In her attic-window the staff she set,
    To show that one heart was loyal yet.

    Up the street came the rebel tread,
    Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.

    Under his slouch'd hat left and right
    He glanced: the old flag met his sight.

    "Halt!"--the dust-brown ranks stood fast
    "Fire!"--out blazed the rifle-blast.

    It shiver'd the window, pane and sash;
    It rent the banner with seam and gash.

    Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
    Dame Barbara snatch'd the silken scarf;

    She lean'd far out on the window-sill,
    And shook it forth with a royal will.

    "Shoot, if you must, this old grey head,
    But spare your country's flag!" she said.

    A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
    Over the face of the leader came;

    The nobler nature within him stirr'd
    To life at that woman's deed and word:

    "Who touches a hair of yon grey head,
    Dies like a dog! March on!" he said.

    All day long through Frederick street
    Sounded the tread of marching feet:

    All day long that free flag toss'd
    Over the heads of the rebel host.

    Ever its torn folds rose and fell
    On the loyal winds that lov'd it well;

    And through the hill-gaps sunset light
    Shone over it with a warm good-night.

    Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,
    And the Rebel rides on his raids no more

    Honor to her! and let a tear
    Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.

    Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,
    Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!

    Peace and order and beauty draw
    Round thy symbol of light and law;

    And ever the stars above look down
    On thy stars below in Frederick town!

LXXVIII. THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION.

THE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE.--1809-

From KIN BEYOND SEA.

The Constitution has not been the offspring of the thought of man. The Cabinet, and all the
present relations of the Constitutional powers in this country, have grown into their present
dimensions, and settled into their present places, not as the fruit of a philosophy, not in
the effort to give effect to an abstract principle; but by the silent action of forces, invisible
and insensible, the structure has come up into the view of all the world. It is, perhaps, the
most conspicuous object on the wide political horizon; but it has thus risen, without noise,
like the temple of Jerusalem.

    "No workman steel, no ponderous hammers rung;
    Like some tall palm the stately fabric sprung."

When men repeat the proverb which teaches us that "marriages are made in heaven," what they
mean is that, in the most fundamental of all social operations, the building up of the family,
the issues involved in the nuptial contract, lie beyond the best exercise of human thought,
and the unseen forces of providential government make good the defect in our imperfect capacity.
Even so would it seem to have been in that curious marriage of competing influences and powers,
which brings about the composite harmony of the British Constitution. More, it must be admitted,
than any other, it leaves open doors which lead into blind alleys; for it presumes, more boldly
than any other, the good sense and good faith of those who work it. If, unhappily, these personages
meet together, on the great arena of a nation's fortunes, as jockeys meet upon a racecourse,
each to urge to the uttermost, as against the others, the power of the animal he rides; or
as counsel in a court, each to procure the victory of his client, without respect to any other
interest or right: then this boasted Constitution of ours is neither more nor less than a heap
of absurdities. The undoubted competency of each reaches even to the paralysis or destruction
of the rest. The House of Commons is entitled to refuse every shilling of the Supplies. That
House, and also the House of Lords, is entitled to refuse its assent to every Bill presented
to it. The Crown is entitled to make a thousand Peers to-day, and as many to-morrow: it may
dissolve all and every Parliament before it proceeds to business; may pardon the most atrocious
crimes; may declare war against all the world; may conclude treaties involving unlimited responsibilities,
and even vast expenditure, without the consent, nay without the knowledge, of Parliament, and
this not merely in support or in development, but in reversal, of policy already known to and
sanctioned by the nation. But the assumption is that the depositaries of power will all respect
one another; will evince a consciousness that they are working in a common interest for a common
end; that they will be possessed, together with not less than an average intelligence, of not
less than an average sense of equity and of the public interest and rights. When these reasonable
expectations fail, then, it must be admitted, the British Constitution will be in danger.

Apart from such contingencies, the offspring only of folly or of crime, this Constitution is
peculiarly liable to subtle change. Not only in the long-run, as man changes between youth
and age, but also, like the human body, with a quotidian life, a periodical recurrence of ebbing
and flowing tides. Its old particles daily run to waste, and give place to new. What is hoped
among us is, that which has usually been found, that evils will become palpable before they
have grown to be intolerable....

Meantime, we of this island are not great political philosophers; and we contend with an earnest,
but disproportioned, vehemence about changes which are palpable, such as the extension of the
suffrage, or the redistribution of Parliamentary seats, neglecting wholly other processes of
change which work beneath the surface, and in the dark, but which are even more fertile of
great organic results. The modern English character reflects the English Constitution in this,
that it abounds in paradox; that it possesses every strength, but holds it tainted with every
weakness; that it seems alternately both to rise above and to fall below the standard of average
humanity; that there is no allegation of praise or blame which, in some one of the aspects
of its many-sided formation, it does not deserve; that only in the midst of much default, and
much transgression, the people of this United Kingdom either have heretofore established, or
will hereafter establish, their title to be reckoned among the children of men, for the eldest
born of an imperial race.

       *       *       *       *       *

    It fortifies my soul to know
    That, though I perish, Truth is so:
    That, howsoe'er I stray and range,
    Whate'er I do, Thou dost not change.
    I steadier step when I recall
    That, if I slip Thou dost not fall.

        ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH.

LXXIX. THE LORD OF BURLEIGH.

LORD TENNYSON.--1809-

    In her ear he whispers gayly,
      "If my heart by signs can tell,
    Maiden, I have watch'd thee daily,
      And I think thou lov'st me well."
    She replies, in accents fainter,
      "There is none I love like thee."
    He is but a landscape-painter,
      And a village maiden she.
    He to lips, that fondly falter,
      Presses his without reproof:
    Leads her to the village altar,
      And they leave her father's roof.
    "I can make no marriage present;
      Little can I give my wife.
    Love will make our cottage pleasant,
      And I love thee more than life."
    They by parks and lodges going
      See the lordly castles stand:
    Summer woods, about them blowing,
      Made a murmur in the land.
    From deep thought himself he rouses
      Says to her that loves him well,
    "Let us see these handsome houses
      Where the wealthy nobles dwell."
    So she goes by him attended,
      Hears him lovingly converse,
    Sees whatever fair and splendid
      Lay betwixt his home and hers;
    Parks with oak and chestnut shady,
      Parks and order'd gardens great,
    Ancient homes of lord and lady,
      Built for pleasure and for state.
    All he shows her makes him dearer:
      Evermore she seems to gaze
    On that cottage growing nearer,
      Where they twain will spend their days.
    O but she will love him truly!
      He shall have a cheerful home;
    She will order all things duly,
      When beneath his roof they come.
    Thus her heart rejoices greatly,
      Till a gateway she discerns
    With armorial bearings stately,
      And beneath the gate she turns;
    Sees a mansion more majestic
      Than all those she saw before:
    Many a gallant gay domestic
      Bows before him at the door.
    And they speak in gentle murmur,
      When they answer to his call,
    While he treads with footsteps firmer,
      Leading on from hall to hall.
    And, while now she wonders blindly,
      Nor the meaning can divine,
    Proudly turns he round and kindly,
      "All of this is mine and thine."
    Here he lives in state and bounty,
      Lord of Burleigh, fair and free,
    Not a lord in all the county
      Is so great a lord as he.
    All at once the color flushes
      Her sweet face from brow to chin:
    As it were with shame she blushes,
      And her spirit changed within.
    Then her countenance all over
      Pale again as death did prove;
    But he clasp'd her like a lover,
      And he cheer'd her soul with love.
    So she strove against her weakness,
      Tho' at times her spirits sank:
    Shaped her heart with woman's meekness
      To all duties of her rank:
    And a gentle consort made he,
      And her gentle mind was such
    That she grew a noble lady,
      And the people lov'd her much.
    But a trouble weigh'd upon her,
    And perplex'd her, night and morn,
      With the burden of an honor
    Unto which she was not born.
      Faint she grew, and ever fainter,
    As she murmur'd, "O, that he
      Were once more that landscape-painter,
    Which did win my heart from me!"
      So she droop'd and droop'd before him,
    Fading slowly from his side:
      Three fair children first she bore him,
    Then before her time she died.
      Weeping, weeping late and early,
    Walking up and pacing down,
      Deeply mourn'd the Lord of Burleigh,
    Burleigh-house by Stamford-town.
      And he came to look upon her,
    And he look'd at her and said,
      "Bring the dress and put it on her,
    That she wore when she was wed."
      Then her people, softly treading,
    Bore to earth her body, drest
      In the dress that she was wed in,
    That her spirit might have rest.

       *       *       *       *       *

    And yet, dear heart! remembering thee,
      Am I not richer than of old?

        WHITTIER.

LXXX. "BREAK, BREAK, BREAK."

LORD TENNYSON.

    Break, break, break,
      On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
    And I would that my tongue could utter
      The thoughts that arise in me.

    O well for the fisherman's boy,
      That he shouts with his sister at play!
    O well for the sailor lad,
      That he sings in his boat on the bay!

    And the stately ships go on
      To their haven under the hill;
    But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
      And the sound of a voice that is still!

    Break, break, break,
      At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!
    But the tender grace of a day that is dead
      Will never come back to me.

LXXXI. THE "REVENGE."

A BALLAD OF THE FLEET, 1591.

       *       *       *       *       *

    There is no land like England, where'er the light of day be;
    There are no hearts like English hearts, such hearts of oak as
              they be.

        TENNYSON.

LXXXII. HERVÉ RIEL.

ROBERT BROWNING.--1812-

    On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two,
        Did the English fight the French,--woe to France!
    And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter through the blue,
    Like a crowd of frighten'd porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,
        Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance,
    With the English fleet in view.

    'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;
        First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;
            Close on him fled, great and small,
            Twenty-two good ships in all;
    And they signall'd to the place
    "Help the winners of a race!
        Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick;--or, quicker
              still,
        Here's the English can and will!"

    Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board:
        "Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?"
              laugh'd they:
    "Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarr'd and
              scored,
    Shall the Formidable here with her twelve and eighty guns
        Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,
    Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,
            And with flow at full beside?
            Now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide.
        Reach the mooring? Rather say,
    While rock stands or water runs,
        Not a ship will leave the bay!"

    Then was call'd a council straight.
    Brief and bitter the debate:
    "Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow
    All that's left us of the fleet, link'd together stern and bow,
    For a prize to Plymouth Sound?
    Better run the ships aground!"
        (Ended Damfreville his speech.)
    Not a minute more to wait!
        "Let the captains all and each
        Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!
    France must undergo her fate.

    "Give the word!" But no such word
    Was ever spoke or heard;
        For up stood, for out stepp'd, for in struck, amid all these,--
    A captain? a lieutenant? a mate,--first, second, third?
        No such man of mark, and meet
        With his betters to compete!
        But a simple Breton sailor press'd by Tourville for the fleet,
    A poor coasting-pilot he,--Hervé Riel, the Croisickese.

    And "What mockery or malice have we here?" cries Hervé Riel:
        "Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues?
    Talk to me of rocks and shoals?--me, who took the soundings, tell
    On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
        'Twixt the offing here and Grève where the river disembogues?
    Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?
        Morn and eve, night and day,
        Have I piloted your bay,
    Enter'd free and anchor'd fast at the foot of Solidor.
        Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than fifty
              Hogues!
            Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's
              a way!
    Only let me lead the line,
        Have the biggest ship to steer,
        Get this Formidable clear,
    Make the others follow mine,
    And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well,
        Right to Solidor past Grève,
            And there lay them safe and sound;
        And if one ship misbehave,--
            Keel so much as grate the ground,--
    Why, I've nothing but my life,--here's my head!" cries Hervé Riel.

    Not a minute more to wait.
    "Steer us in, then, small and great!
        Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its
              chief.
    Captains, give the sailor place!
        He is admiral, in brief.
    Still the north-wind, by God's grace!
    See the noble fellow's face
    As the big ship, with a bound,
    Clears the entry like a hound,
    Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound!
        See, safe through shoal and rock,
        How they follow in a flock!
    Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,
        Not a spar that comes to grief!
    The peril, see, is past!
    All are harbor'd to the last!
    And just as Hervé Riel hollas "Anchor!"--sure as fate
    Up the English come,--too late!

    So, the storm subsides to calm:
        They see the green trees wave
        On the heights o'erlooking Grève.
    Hearts that bled are stanch'd with balm.
    "Just our rapture to enhance,
        Let the English rake the bay,
    Gnash their teeth and glare askance
        As they cannonade away!
    'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!"
    Now hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance!
    Out burst all with one accord,
        "This is Paradise for Hell!
            Let France, let France's king,
            Thank the man that did the thing!"
    What a shout, and all one word,
        "Hervé Riel!"
    As he stepp'd in front once more,
        Not a symptom of surprise
        In the frank blue Breton eyes,--
    Just the same man as before.

    Then said Damfreville, "My friend,
    I must speak out at the end,
        Though I find the speaking hard.
    Praise is deeper than the lips;
    You have saved the king his ships,
        You must name your own reward.
    'Faith our sun was near eclipse!
    Demand whate'er you will,
    France remains your debtor still.
    Ask to heart's content, and have! or my name's not Damfreville."

    Then a beam of fun outbroke
    On the bearded mouth that spoke,
    As the honest heart laugh'd through
    Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
    "Since I needs must say my say,
        Since on board the duty's done,
        And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a run?--
    Since 'tis ask and have, I may,--
        Since the others go ashore,--
    Come! A good whole holiday!
        Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!"
        That he ask'd and that he got,--nothing more.

    Name and deed alike are lost:
    Not a pillar nor a post
        In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;
    Not a head in white and black
    On a single fishing smack,
    In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
        All that France saved from the fight whence England bore
              the bell.
    Go to Paris: rank on rank
        Search the heroes flung pell-mell
    On the Louvre, face and flank!
        You shall look long enough ere you come to Hervé Riel.
    So, for better and for worse,
    Hervé Riel, accept my verse!
    In my verse, Hervé Riel, do thou once more
    Save the squadron, honor France, love thy wife the Belle Aurore!

       *       *       *       *       *

    The Summum Pulchrum rests in heaven above;
      Do thou, as best thou may'st, thy duty do:
    Amid the things allow'd thee live and love,
      Some day thou shalt it view.

LXXXIII. SONNET.

PRESIDENT WILSON.--1816-

    Great things were ne'er begotten in an hour;
    Ephemerons in birth, are such in life;
    And he who dareth, in the noble strife
    Of intellects, to cope for real power,--
    Such as God giveth as His rarest dower
    Of mastery, to the few with greatness rife,--
    Must, ere the morning mists have ceased to lower
    Till the long shadows of the night arrive,
    Stand in the arena. Laurels that are won,
    Pluck'd from green boughs, soon wither; those that last
    Are gather'd patiently, when sultry noon
    And summer's fiery glare in vain are past.
    Life is the hour of labor; on Earth's breast
    Serene and undisturb'd shall be thy rest.

LXXXIV. OUR IDEAL.

PRESIDENT WILSON.

    Did ever on painter's canvas live
      The power of his fancy's dream?
    Did ever poet's pen achieve
      Fruition of his theme?
    Did marble ever take the life
      That the sculptor's soul conceiv'd?
    Or ambition win in passion's strife
      What its glowing hopes believ'd?
    Did ever racer's eager feet
      Rest as he reach'd the goal,
    Finding the prize achiev'd was meet
      To satisfy his soul?

LXXXV. FROM THE APOLOGY OF SOCRATES.

BENJAMIN JOWETT.--1817-

From THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO.

Not much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil name which you will get from
the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed Socrates, a wise man; for they will
call me wise, even although I am not wise, when they want to reproach you. If you had waited
a little while, your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature. For I am far
advanced in years, as you may perceive, and not far from death. I am speaking now only to those
of you who have condemned me to death. And I have another thing to say to them: You think that
I was convicted through deficiency of words--I mean, that if I had thought fit to leave nothing
undone, nothing unsaid, I might have gained an acquittal. Not so; the deficiency which led
to my conviction was not of words--certainly not. But I had not the boldness or impudence or
inclination to address you as you would have liked me to address you, weeping and wailing and
lamenting, and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed to hear from others,
and which, as I say, are unworthy of me. But I thought that I ought not to do anything common
or mean in the hour of danger: nor do I now repent of the manner of my defense, and I would
rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and live. For neither in
war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there
is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers,
he may escape death; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man
is willing to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but
in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. I am old and move slowly, and
the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are keen and quick, and the faster runner,
who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them. And now I depart hence, condemned by you to suffer
the penalty of death, and they too go their ways, condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty
of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award--let them abide by theirs. I suppose that
these things may be regarded as fated,--and I think that they are well.

And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; for I am about to die,
and that is the hour in which men are gifted with prophetic power. And I prophesy to you who
are my murderers, that immediately after my death punishment far heavier than you have inflicted
on me will surely await you. Me you have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser, and
not to give an account of your lives. But that will not be as you suppose: far otherwise. For
I say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now; accusers whom hitherto I
have restrained: and as they are younger they will be more severe with you, and you will be
more offended at them. For if you think that by killing men you can avoid the accuser censuring
your lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or honorable;
the easiest and the noblest way is not to be crushing others, but to be improving yourselves.
This is the prophecy which I utter before my departure to the judges who have condemned me.

Friends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk with you about this thing which
has happened, while the magistrates are busy, and before I go to the place at which I must
die. Stay then a while, for we may as well talk with one another while there is time. You are
my friends, and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me.
O my judges--for you I may truly call judges--I should like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance.
Hitherto the familiar oracle within me has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even
about trifles, if I was going to make a slip or error about anything; and now as you see there
has come upon me that which may be thought, and is generally believed to be, the last and worst
evil. But the oracle made no sign of opposition, either as I was leaving my house and going
out in the morning, or when I was going up into this court, or while I was speaking, at anything
which I was going to say; and yet I have often been stopped in the middle of a speech, but
now in nothing I either said or did touching this matter has the oracle opposed me. What do
I take to be the explanation of this? I will tell you. I regard this as a proof that what has
happened to me is a good, and that those of us who think that death is an evil are in error.
This is a great proof to me of what I am saying, for the customary sign would surely have opposed
me had I been going to evil and not to good.

Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to hope that death
is a good, for one of two things: either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness,
or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another. Now
if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed
even by the sight of dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select
the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this
the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he
had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that
any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will not find many such days
or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death is like this, I say that to die is gain;
for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey to another place, and
there, as men say, all the dead are, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than
this? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors
of justice in this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there, Minos
and Rhadamanthus, and, Æacus, and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in
their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if he might
converse with Orpheus and Musæus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again
and again. I, too, shall have a wonderful interest in a place where I can converse with Palamedes,
and Ajax the son of Telamon, and other heroes of old, who have suffered death through an unjust
judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with
theirs. Above all, I shall be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as
in this world, so also in that; I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise,
and is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine the leader of the great
Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or numberless others, men and women too? What infinite
delight would there be in conversing with them and asking them questions! For in that world
they do not put a man to death for this; certainly not. For besides being happier in that world
than in this, they will be immortal, if what is said is true.

Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know this of a truth--that no evil can
happen to a good man, either in life or after death. He and his are not neglected by the gods;
nor has my own approaching end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to die and be
released was better for me; and therefore the oracle gave no sign. For which reason, also,
I am not angry with my accusers or my condemners; they have done me no harm, although neither
of them meant to do me any good; and for this I may gently blame them.

Still I have a favor to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, I would ask you, O my friends,
to punish them, and I would have you trouble them, as I have troubled you, if they seem to
care about riches, or anything, more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something
when they are really nothing,--then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about
that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when they are really
nothing. And if you do this, I and my sons will have received justice at your hands.

The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways--I to die, and you to live. Which is
better God only knows.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Be of good cheer then, my dear Crito, and say that you
    are burying my body only.

LXXXVI. THE EMPIRE OF THE CÆSARS.

JAMES ANTHONY FROUDE.--1818-

From CÆSAR.

Of Cæsar it may be said that he came into the world at a special time and for a special object.
The old religions were dead, from the Pillars of Hercules to the Euphrates and the Nile, and
the principles on which human society had been constructed were dead also. There remained of
spiritual conviction only the common and human sense of justice and morality; and out of this
sense some ordered system of government had to be constructed, under which quiet men could
live, and labor, and eat the fruit of their industry. Under a rule of this material kind there
can be no enthusiasm, no chivalry, no saintly aspirations, no patriotism of the heroic type.
It was not to last forever. A new life was about to dawn for mankind. Poetry, and faith, and
devotion were to spring again out of the seeds which were sleeping in the heart of humanity.
But the life which is to endure grows slowly; and as the soil must be prepared before the wheat
can be sown, so before the Kingdom of Heaven could throw up its shoots there was needed a kingdom
of this world where the nations were neither torn in pieces by violence nor were rushing after
false ideals and spurious ambitions. Such a kingdom was the Empire of the Cæsars--a kingdom
where peaceful men could work, think, and speak as they pleased, and travel freely among provinces
ruled for the most part by Gallios who protected life and property, and forbade fanatics to
tear each other in pieces for their religious opinions. "It is not lawful for us to put any
man to death," was the complaint of the Jewish priests to the Roman governor. Had Europe and
Asia been covered with independent nations, each with a local religion represented in its ruling
powers, Christianity must have been stifled in its cradle. If St. Paul had escaped the Sanhedrim
at Jerusalem, he would have been torn to pieces by the silversmiths at Ephesus. The appeal
to Cæsar's judgment-seat was the shield of his mission, and alone made possible his success.

LXXXVII. OF THE MYSTERY OF LIFE.

JOHN RUSKIN--1819-

From SESAME AND LILIES.

And now, returning to the broader question what these arts and labors of life have to teach
us of its mystery, this is the first of their lessons--that the more beautiful the art, the
more it is essentially the work of people who feel themselves wrong;--who are striving for
the fulfilment of a law, and the grasp of a loveliness, which they have not yet attained, which
they feel even farther and farther from attaining, the more they strive for it. And yet, in
still deeper sense, it is the work of people who know also that they are right. The very sense
of inevitable error from their purpose marks the perfectness of that purpose, and the continued
sense of failure arises from the continued opening of the eyes more clearly to all the sacredest
laws of truth.

This is one lesson. The second is a very plain, and greatly precious one, namely:--that whenever
the arts and labors of life are fulfilled in this spirit of striving against misrule, and doing
whatever we have to do, honorably and perfectly, they invariably bring happiness, as much as
seems possible to the nature of man. In all other paths, by which that happiness is pursued,
there is disappointment, or destruction: for ambition and for passion there is no rest--no
fruition; the fairest pleasures of youth perish in a darkness greater than their past light;
and the loftiest and purest love too often does but inflame the cloud of life with endless
fire of pain. But, ascending from lowest to highest, through every scale of human industry,
that industry worthily followed, gives peace. Ask the laborer in the field, at the forge, or
in the mine; ask the patient, delicate-fingered artisan, or the strong-armed, fiery-hearted
worker in bronze, and in marble, and with the colors of light; and none of these, who are true
workmen, will ever tell you, that they have found the law of heaven an unkind one--that in
the sweat of their face they should eat bread, till they return to the ground; nor that they
ever found it an unrewarded obedience, if, indeed, it was rendered faithfully to the command--"Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do--do it with thy might."

These are the two great and constant lessons which our laborers teach us of the mystery of
life. But there is another, and a sadder one, which they cannot teach us, which we must read
on their tombstones.

"Do it with thy might." There have been myriads upon myriads of human creatures who have obeyed
this law--who have put every breath and nerve of their being into its toil--who have devoted
every hour, and exhausted every faculty--who have bequeathed their unaccomplished thoughts
at death--who being dead, have yet spoken, by majesty of memory, and strength of example. And,
at last, what has all this "Might" of humanity accomplished, in six thousand years of labor
and sorrow? What has it done? Take the three chief occupations and arts of men, one by one,
and count their achievements. Begin with the first--the lord of them all--agriculture. Six
thousand years have passed since we were set to till the ground, from which we were taken.
How much of it is tilled? How much of that which is, wisely or well? In the very centre and
chief garden of Europe--where the two forms of parent Christianity have had their fortresses--where
the noble Catholics of the Forest Cantons, and the noble Protestants of the Vaudois valleys,
have maintained, for dateless ages, their faiths and liberties--there the unchecked Alpine
rivers yet run wild in devastation: and the marshes, which a few hundred men could redeem with
a year's labor, still blast their helpless inhabitants into fevered idiotism. That is so, in
the centre of Europe! While, on the near coast of Africa, once the Garden of the Hesperides,
an Arab woman, but a few sunsets since, ate her child, for famine. And, with all the treasures
of the East at our feet, we, in our own dominion, could not find a few grains of rice, for
a people that asked of us no more; but stood by, and saw five hundred thousand of them perish
of hunger.

Then, after agriculture, the art of kings, take the next head of human arts--weaving; the art
of queens, honored of all noble Heathen women, in the person of their virgin goddess--honored
of all Hebrew women, by the word of their wisest king--"She layeth her hands to the spindle,
and her hands hold the distaff; she stretcheth out her hand to the poor. She maketh herself
covering of tapestry, her clothing is silk and purple. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it,
and delivereth girdles to the merchant." What have we done in all these thousands of years
with this bright art of Greek maid and Christian matron? Six thousand years of weaving, and
have we learned to weave? Might not every naked wall have been purple with tapestry, and every
feeble breast fenced with sweet colors from the cold? What have we done? Our fingers are too
few, it seems, to twist together some poor covering for our bodies. We set our streams to work
for us, and choke the air with fire, to turn our spinning-wheels,--and--are we yet clothed?
Are not the streets of the capitals of Europe foul with the sale of cast clouts and rotten
rags? Is not the beauty of your sweet children left in wretchedness of disgrace, while, with
better honor, nature clothes the brood of the bird in its nest, and the suckling of the wolf
in her den? And does not every winter's snow robe what you have not robed, and shroud what
you have not shrouded; and every winter's wind bear up to heaven its wasted souls, to witness
against you hereafter, by the voice of their Christ,--"I was naked, and ye clothed me not"?

Lastly--take the Art of Building--the strongest-proudest--most orderly--most enduring of the
arts of man, that of which the produce is in the surest manner accumulative, and need not perish,
or be replaced; but if once well done will stand more strongly than the unbalanced rocks--more
prevalently than the crumbling hills. The art which is associated with all civic pride and
sacred principle; with which men record their power--satisfy their enthusiasm--make sure their
defence--define and make dear their habitation. And, in six thousand years of building, what
have we done? Of the greater part of all that skill and strength, no vestige is left, but fallen
stones, that encumber the fields and impede the streams. But from this waste of disorder, and
of time, and of rage, what is left to us? Constructive and progressive creatures, that we are,
with ruling brains, and forming hands; capable of fellowship, and thirsting for fame, can we
not contend, in comfort, with the insects of the forest, or, in achievement, with the worm
of the sea? The white surf rages in vain against the ramparts built by poor atoms of scarcely
nascent life; but only ridges of formless ruin mark the places where once dwelt our noblest
multitudes. The ant and the moth have cells for each of their young, but our little ones lie
in festering heaps, in homes that consume them like graves; and night by night, from the corners
of our streets, rises up the cry of the homeless--"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in."

Must it be always thus? Is our life forever to be without profit--without possession? Shall
the strength of its generations be as barren as death; or cast away their labor, as the wild
fig-tree casts her untimely figs? Is it all a dream then--the desire of the eyes and the pride
of life--or, if it be, might we not live in nobler dream than this? The poets and prophets,
the wise men, and the scribes, though they have told us nothing about a life to come, have
told us much about the life that is now. They have had--they also,--their dreams, and we have
laughed at them. They have dreamed of mercy, and of justice; they have dreamed of peace and
good-will; they have dreamed of labor undisappointed, and of rest undisturbed; they have dreamed
of fulness in harvest, and overflowing in store; they have dreamed of wisdom in council, and
of providence in law; of gladness of parents, and strength of children, and glory of gray hairs.
And at these visions of theirs we have mocked, and held them for idle and vain, unreal and
unaccomplishable. What have we accomplished with our realities? Is this what has come of our
worldly wisdom, tried against their folly? this our mightiest possible, against their impotent
ideal? or have we only wandered among the spectra of a baser felicity, and chased phantoms
of the tombs, instead of visions of the Almighty; and walked after the imaginations of our
evil hearts, instead of after the counsels of Eternity, until our lives--not in the likeness
of the cloud of heaven, but of the smoke of hell--have become "as a vapor, that appeareth for
a little time, and then vanisheth away"?

Does it vanish then? Are you sure of that?--sure, that the nothingness of the grave will be
a rest from this troubled nothingness; and that the coiling shadow, which disquiets itself
in vain, cannot change into the smoke of the torment that ascends forever? Will any answer
that they are sure of it, and that there is no fear, nor hope, nor desire, nor labor, whither
they go? Be it so; will you not, then, make as sure of the Life, that now is, as you are of
the Death that is to come? Your hearts are wholly in this world--will you not give them to
it wisely, as well as perfectly? And see, first of all, that you have hearts, and sound hearts,
too, to give. Because you have no heaven to look for, is that any reason that you should remain
ignorant of this wonderful and infinite earth, which is firmly and instantly given you in possession?
Although your days are numbered, and the following darkness sure, is it necessary that you
should share the degradation of the brute, because you are condemned to its mortality; or live
the life of the moth, and of the worm, because you are to companion them in the dust? Not so;
we may have but a few thousands of days to spend, perhaps hundreds only--perhaps tens; nay,
the longest of our time and best, looked back on, will be but as a moment, as the twinkling
of an eye; still, we are men, not insects; we are living spirits, not passing clouds. "He maketh
the winds His messengers; the momentary fire, His minister;" and shall we do less than these?
Let us do the work of men while we bear the form of them; and, as we snatch our narrow portion
of time out of Eternity, snatch also our narrow inheritance of passion out of Immortality--even
though our lives be as a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

But there are some of you who believe not this--who think this cloud of life has no such close--that
it is to float, revealed and illumined, upon the floor of heaven, in the day when He cometh
with clouds, and every eye shall see Him. Some day, you believe, within these five, or ten,
or twenty years, for every one of us the judgment will be set, and the books opened. If that
be true, far more than that must be true. Is there but one day of judgment? Why, for us every
day is a day of judgment--every day is a Dies Iræ, and writes its irrevocable verdict in the
flame of its West. Think you that judgment waits till the doors of the grave are opened? It
waits at the doors of your houses--it waits at the corners of your streets; we are in the midst
of judgment--the insects that we crush are our judges--the moments we fret away are our judges--the
elements that feed us, judge, as they minister--and the pleasures that deceive us, judge as
they indulge. Let us, for our lives, do the work of Men while we bear the Form of them, if
indeed those lives are Not as a vapor, and do Not vanish away.

LXXXVIII. THE ROBIN.

JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.--1819-

From MY GARDEN ACQUAINTANCE.

The return of the robin is commonly announced by the newspapers, like that of eminent or notorious
people to a watering-place, as the first authentic notification of spring. And such his appearance
in the orchard and garden undoubtedly is. But, in spite of his name of migratory thrush, he
stays with us all winter, and I have seen him when the thermometer marked 15 degrees below
zero of Fahrenheit, armed impregnably within, like Emerson's Titmouse, and as cheerful as he.
The robin has a bad reputation among people who do not value themselves less for being fond
of cherries. There is, I admit, a spice of vulgarity in him, and his song is rather of the
Bloomfield sort, too largely ballasted with prose. His ethics are of the Poor Richard school,
and the main chance which calls forth all his energy is altogether of the belly. He never has
those fine intervals of lunacy into which his cousins, the catbird and the mavis, are apt to
fall. But for a' that and twice as muckle 's a' that, I would not exchange him for all the
cherries that ever came out of Asia Minor. With whatever faults, he has not wholly forfeited
that superiority which belongs to the children of nature. He has a finer taste in fruit than
could be distilled from many successive committees of the Horticultural Society, and he eats
with a relishing gulp not inferior to Dr. Johnson's. He feels and freely exercises his right
of eminent domain. His is the earliest mess of green peas; his all the mulberries I had fancied
mine. But if he get also the lion's share of the raspberries, he is a great planter, and sows
those wild ones in the woods, that solace the pedestrian and give a momentary calm even to
the jaded victims of the White Hills. He keeps a strict eye over one's fruit, and knows to
a shade of purple when your grapes have cooked long enough in the sun. During a severe drought
a few years ago, the robins wholly vanished from my garden. I neither saw nor heard one for
three weeks. Meanwhile a small foreign grape-vine, rather shy of bearing, seemed to find the
dusty air congenial, and, dreaming perhaps of its sweet Argos across the sea, decked itself,
with a score or so of fair bunches. I watched them from day to day till they should have secreted
sugar enough from the sunbeams, and at last made up my mind that I would celebrate my vintage
the next morning. But the robins too had somehow kept note of them. They must have sent out
spies, as did the Jews into the promised land, before I was stirring. When I went with my basket,
at least a dozen of these winged vintagers bustled out from among the leaves, and alighting
on the nearest trees interchanged some shrill remarks about me of a derogatory nature. They
had fairly sacked the vine. Not Wellington's veterans made cleaner work of a Spanish town;
not Federals or Confederates were ever more impartial in the confiscation of neutral chickens.
I was keeping my grapes a secret to surprise the fair Fidele with, but the robins made them
a profounder secret to her than I had meant. The tattered remnant of a single bunch was all
my harvest-home. How paltry it looked at the bottom of my basket,--as if a humming-bird had
laid her egg in an eagle's nest! I could not help laughing; and the robins seemed to join heartily
in the merriment. There was a native grape-vine close by, blue with its less refined abundance,
but my cunning thieves preferred the foreign flavor. Could I tax them with want of taste?

The robins are not good solo singers, but their chorus, as, like primitive fire-worshippers,
they hail the return of light and warmth to the world, is unrivalled. There are a hundred singing
like one. They are noisy enough then, and sing, as poets should, with no afterthought. But
when they come after cherries to the tree near my window, they muffle their voices, and their
faint pip, pip, pop! sounds far away at the bottom of the garden, where they know I shall not
suspect them of robbing the great black-walnut of its bitter-rinded store.[P] They are feathered
Pecksniffs, to be sure, but then how brightly their breasts, that look rather shabby in the
sunlight, shine in a rainy day against the dark green of the fringe-tree! After they have pinched
and shaken all the life out of an earthworm, as Italian cooks pound all the spirit out of a
steak, and then gulped him, they stand up in honest self-confidence, expand their red waistcoats
with the virtuous air of a lobby member, and outface you with an eye that calmly challenges
inquiry. "Do I look like a bird that knows the flavor of raw vermin? I throw myself upon a
jury of my peers. Ask any robin if he ever ate anything less ascetic than the frugal berry
of the juniper, and he will answer that his vow forbids him." Can such an open bosom cover
such depravity? Alas, yes! I have no doubt his breast was redder at that very moment with the
blood of my raspberries. On the whole, he is a doubtful friend in the garden. He makes his
dessert of all kinds of berries, and is not averse from early pears. But when we remember how
omnivorous he is, eating his own weight in an incredibly short time, and that Nature seems
exhaustless in her invention of new insects hostile to vegetation, perhaps we may reckon that
he does more good than harm. For my own part, I would rather have his cheerfulness and kind
neighborhood than many berries.

LXXXIX. THE OLD CRADLE.

FREDERICK LOCKER.--1821-

    And this was your Cradle? Why, surely, my Jenny,
      Such cosy dimensions go clearly to show
    You were an exceedingly small pickaninny
      Some nineteen or twenty short summers ago.

    Your baby-days flow'd in a much-troubled channel;
      I see you, as then, in your impotent strife,
    A tight little bundle of wailing and flannel,
      Perplex'd with the newly-found fardel of Life.

    To hint at an infantile frailty's a scandal;
      Let bygones be bygones, for somebody knows
    It was bliss such a Baby to dance and to dandle,--
      Your cheeks were so dimpled, so rosy your toes.

    Ay, here is your Cradle; and Hope, a bright spirit,
      With Love now is watching beside it, I know.
    They guard the wee nest it was yours to inherit
      Some nineteen or twenty short summers ago.

    It is Hope gilds the future, Love welcomes it smiling,
      Thus wags this old world, therefore stay not to ask,
    "My future bids fair, is my future beguiling?"
      If mask'd, still it pleases--then raise not its mask.

    Is Life a poor coil some would gladly be doffing?
      He is riding post-haste who their wrongs will adjust;
    For at most 'tis a footstep from cradle to coffin--
      From a spoonful of pap to a mouthful of dust.

    Then smile as your future is smiling, my Jenny;
      I see you, except for those infantine woes,
    Little changed since you were but a small pickaninny--
      Your cheeks were so dimpled, so rosy your toes!

    Ay, here is your Cradle, much, much to my liking,
      Though nineteen or twenty long winters have sped.
    Hark! As I'm talking there's six o'clock striking,--
      It is time JENNY'S BABY should be in its bed.

XC. RUGBY CHAPEL.

NOVEMBER, 1857.

MATTHEW ARNOLD.--1822-

    Coldly, sadly descends
    The autumn-evening. The field
    Strewn with its dank yellow drifts
    Of wither'd leaves, and the elms,
    Fade into dimness apace,
    Silent;--hardly a shout
    From a few boys late at their play!
    The lights come out in the street,
    In the school-room windows--but cold,
    Solemn, unlighted, austere,
    Through the gathering darkness, arise
    The chapel-walls, in whose bound
    Thou, my father! art laid.

    There thou dost lie, in the gloom
    Of the autumn evening. But ah!
    That word, gloom, to my mind
    Brings thee back in the light
    Of thy radiant vigor again:
    In the gloom of November we pass'd
    Days not dark at thy side;
    Seasons impair'd not the ray
    Of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear.
    Such thou wast! and I stand
    In the autumn evening, and think
    Of bygone autumns with thee.

    Fifteen years have gone round
    Since thou arosest to tread,
    In the summer-morning, the road
    Of death, at a call unforeseen,
    Sudden. For fifteen years,
    We who till then in thy shade
    Rested as under the boughs
    Of a mighty oak, have endured
    Sunshine and rain as we might,
    Bare, unshaded, alone,
    Lacking the shelter of thee.

    O strong soul, by what shore
    Tarriest thou now? For that force,
    Surely, has not been left vain!
    Somewhere, surely, afar,
    In the sounding labor-house vast
    Of being, is practis'd that strength,
    Zealous, beneficent, firm!
    Yes, in some far-shining sphere,
    Conscious or not of the past,
    Still thou performest the word
    Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live--
    Prompt, unwearied, as here!
    Still thou upraisest with zeal
    The humble good from the ground,
    Sternly repressest the bad!
    Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse
    Those who with half-open eyes
    Tread the border-land dim
    'Twixt vice and virtue; reviv'st,
    Succorest!--this was thy work.
    This was thy life upon earth.

    What is the course of the life
    Of mortal men on the earth?--
    Most men eddy about
    Here and there--eat and drink,
    Chatter and love and hate,
    Gather and squander, are rais'd
    Aloft, are hurl'd in the dust,
    Striving blindly, achieving
    Nothing; and then they die--
    Perish--and no one asks
    Who or what they have been,
    More than he asks what waves,
    In the moonlit solitudes mild
    Of the midmost Ocean, have swell'd,
    Foam'd for a moment, and gone.

    And there are some, whom a thirst
    Ardent, unquenchable, fires,
    Not with the crowd to be spent,
    Not without aim to go round
    In an eddy of purposeless dust
    Effort unmeaning and vain.
    Ah yes! some of us strive
    Not without action to die
    Fruitless, but something to snatch
    From dull oblivion, nor all
    Glut the devouring grave!
    We, we have chosen our path--
    Path to a clear-purpos'd goal,
    Path of advance!--but it leads
    A long, steep journey, through sunk
    Gorges, o'er mountains in snow.
    Cheerful, with friends, we set forth--
    Then, on the height, comes the storm.
    Thunder crashes from rock
    To rock, the cataracts reply;
    Lightnings dazzle our eyes;
    Roaring torrents have breach'd
    The track, the stream-bed descends
    In the place where the wayfarer once
    Planted his footstep--the spray
    Boils o'er its borders! aloft
    The unseen snow-beds dislodge
    Their hanging ruin!--alas,
    Havoc is made in our train!
    Friends, who set forth at our side,
    Falter, are lost in the storm.
    We, we only are left!--
    With frowning foreheads, with lips
    Sternly compress'd, we strain on
    On--and at nightfall at last
    Come to the end of our way,
    To the lonely inn 'mid the rocks;
    Where the gaunt and taciturn host
    Stands on the threshold, the wind
    Shaking his thin white hairs--
    Holds his lantern to scan
    Our storm-beat figures, and asks:
    Whom in our party we bring?
    Whom we have left in the snow?

    Sadly we answer: We bring
    Only ourselves! we lost
    Sight of the rest in the storm.
    Hardly ourselves we fought through,
    Stripp'd, without friends, as we are.
    Friends, companions, and train,
    The avalanche swept from our side.

    But thou would'st not alone
    Be saved, my father! alone
    Conquer and come to thy goal,
    Leaving the rest in the wild.
    We were weary; and we
    Fearful, and we in our march
    Fain to drop down and to die.
    Still thou turnedst, and still
    Beckonedst the trembler, and still
    Gavest the weary thy hand.
    If, in the paths of the world,
    Stones might have wounded thy feet,
    Toil or dejection have tried
    Thy spirit, of that we saw
    Nothing--to us thou wast still
    Cheerful, and helpful, and firm!
    Therefore to thee it was given
    Many to save with thyself;
    And, at the end of thy day,
    O faithful shepherd! to come,
    Bringing thy sheep in thy hand,
    And through thee I believe
    In the noble and great who are gone;
    Pure souls honor'd and blest
    By former ages, who else--
    Such, so soulless, so poor,
    Is the race of men whom I see--
    Seem'd but a dream of the heart,
    Seem'd but a cry of desire.
    Yes! I believe that there liv'd
    Others like thee in the past,
    Not like the men of the crowd
    Who all round me to-day
    Bluster or cringe, and make life
    Hideous, and arid, and vile;
    But souls temper'd with fire,
    Fervent, heroic, and good,
    Helpers and friends of mankind.

    Servants of God!--or sons
    Shall I not call you? because
    Not as servants ye knew
    Your Father's innermost mind,
    His, who unwillingly sees
    One of his little ones lost--
    Yours is the praise, if mankind
    Hath not as yet in its march
    Fainted, and fallen, and died!

    See! In the rocks of the world
    Marches the host of mankind,
    A feeble, wavering line.
    Where are they tending?--A God
    Marshall'd them, gave them their goal.--
    Ah, but the way is so long!

    Years they have been in the wild!
    Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks,
    Rising all round, overawe;
    Factions divide them, their host
    Threatens to break, to dissolve.--
    Ah, keep, keep them combined!
    Else, of the myriads who fill
    That army, not one shall arrive;
    Sole they shall stray; on the rocks
    Batter forever in vain,
    Die one by one in the waste.

    Then, in such hour of need
    Of your fainting, dispirited race,
    Ye, like angels, appear,
    Radiant with ardor divine.
    Beacons of hope, ye appear!
    Languor is not in your heart,
    Weakness is not in your word,
    Weariness not on your brow.
    Ye alight in our van! at your voice,
    Panic, despair, flee away.
    Ye move through the ranks, recall
    The stragglers, refresh the outworn,
    Praise, re-inspire the brave.
    Order, courage, return;
    Eyes rekindling, and prayers,
    Follow your steps as ye go.
    Ye fill up the gaps in our files,
    Strengthen the wavering line,
    Stablish, continue our march,
    On, to the bound of the waste,
    On, to the City of God.

       *       *       *       *       *

    What know we greater than the soul?
    On God and Godlike men we build our trust.

        TENNYSON.

XCI. IN THE ORILLIA WOODS.

CHARLES SANGSTER.--1822-

      My footsteps press where, centuries ago,
      The Red Men fought and conquer'd; lost and won.
      Whole tribes and races, gone like last year's snow,
      Have found the Eternal Hunting-Grounds, and run
      The fiery gauntlet of their active days,
      Till few are left to tell the mournful tale:
      And these inspire us with such wild amaze
      They seem like spectres passing down a vale
      Steep'd in uncertain moonlight, on their way
      Towards some bourn where darkness blinds the day,
      And night is wrapp'd in mystery profound.
      We cannot lift the mantle of the past:
      We seem to wander over hallow'd ground:
    We scan the trail of Thought, but all is overcast.

      THERE WAS A TIME--and that is all we know!
      No record lives of their ensanguin'd deeds:
      The past seems palsied with some giant blow,
      And grows the more obscure on what it feeds.
      A rotted fragment of a human leaf;
      A few stray skulls; a heap of human bones!
      These are the records--the traditions brief--
      'Twere easier far to read the speechless stones.
      The fierce Ojibwas, with tornado force,
      Striking white terror to the hearts of braves!
      The mighty Hurons, rolling on their course,
      Compact and steady as the ocean waves!
      The fiery Iroquois, a warrior host!
    Who were they?--Whence?--And why? no human tongue can boast!

XCII. MORALS AND CHARACTER IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.

GOLDWIN SMITH.--1823-

From COWPER.

The world into which Cowper came was one very adverse to him, and at the same time very much
in need of him. It was a world from which the spirit of poetry seemed to have fled. There could
be no stronger proof of this than the occupation of the throne of Spenser, Shakespeare, and
Milton, by the arch-versifier Pope. The Revolution of 1688 was glorious, but unlike the Puritan
Revolution which it followed, and in the political sphere partly ratified, it was profoundly
prosaic. Spiritual religion, the source of Puritan grandeur and of the poetry of Milton, was
almost extinct; there was not much more of it among the Nonconformists, who had now become
to a great extent mere Whigs, with a decided Unitarian tendency. The Church was little better
than a political force cultivated and manipulated by political leaders for their own purposes.
The Bishops were either politicians, or theological polemics collecting trophies of victory
over free-thinkers as titles to higher preferment. The inferior clergy as a body were far nearer
in character to Trulliber than to Dr. Primrose; coarse, sordid, neglectful of their duties,
shamelessly addicted to sinecurism and pluralities, fanatics in their Toryism and in attachment
to their corporate privileges, cold, rationalistic, and almost heathen in their preachings,
if they preached at all. The society of the day is mirrored in the pictures of Hogarth in the
works of Fielding and Smollett; hard and heartless polish was the best of it; and not a little
of it was Marriage à la Mode. Chesterfield, with his soulless culture, his court graces, and
his fashionable immoralities, was about the highest type of an English gentleman; but the Wilkeses,
Potters, and Sandwiches, whose mania for vice culminated in the Hell-fire Club, were more numerous
than the Chesterfields. Among the country squires, for one Allworthy, or Sir Roger de Coverley,
there were many Westerns. Among the common people religion was almost extinct, and assuredly
no new morality or sentiment, such as Positivists now promise, had taken its place. Sometimes
the rustic thought for himself, and scepticism took formal possession of his mind; but as we
see from one of Cowper's letters, it was a coarse scepticism which desired to be buried with
its hounds. Ignorance and brutality reigned in the cottage. Drunkenness reigned in palace and
cottage alike. Gambling, cock-fighting, and bull-fighting were the amusements of the people.
Political life, which, if it had been pure and vigorous, might have made up for the absence
of spiritual influences, was corrupt from the top of the scale to the bottom: its effect on
national character is portrayed in Hogarth's Election. That property had its duties as well
as its rights, nobody had yet ventured to say or think. The duty of a gentleman towards his
own class was to pay his debts of honor, and to fight a duel whenever he was challenged by
one of his own order; towards the lower class his duty was none. Though the forms of government
were elective, and Cowper gives us a description of the candidate at election time obsequiously
soliciting votes, society was intensely aristocratic, and each rank was divided from that below
it by a sharp line which precluded brotherhood or sympathy. Says the Duchess of Buckingham
to Lady Huntingdon, who had asked her to come and hear Whitefield, "I thank your ladyship for
the information concerning the Methodist preachers; their doctrines are most repulsive, and
strongly tinctured with disrespect towards their superiors, in perpetually endeavoring to level
all ranks and do away with all distinctions. It is monstrous to be told you have a heart as
sinful as the common wretches that crawl on the earth. This is highly offensive and insulting;
and I cannot but wonder that your ladyship should relish any sentiments so much at variance
with high rank and good breeding. I shall be most happy to come and hear your favorite preacher."
Her Grace's sentiments towards the common wretches that crawl on the earth were shared, we
may be sure, by her Grace's waiting-maid. Of humanity there was as little as there was of religion.
It was the age of the criminal law which hanged men for petty thefts, of life-long imprisonment
for debt, of the stocks and the pillory, of a Temple Bar garnished with the heads of traitors,
of the unreformed prison system, of the press-gang, of unrestrained tyranny and savagery at
public schools. That the slave trade was iniquitous hardly any one suspected; even men who
deemed themselves religious took part in it without scruple. But a change was at hand, and
a still mightier change was in prospect. At the time of Cowper's birth, John Wesley was twenty-eight,
and Whitefield was seventeen. With them the revival of religion, was at hand. Johnson, the
moral reformer, was twenty-two. Howard was born, and in less than a generation Wilberforce
was to come.

       *       *       *       *       *

    That is best blood that hath most iron in 't
    To edge resolve with, pouring without stint
      For what makes manhood dear.

        JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.

XCIII. A LIBERAL EDUCATION.

THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY.--1825-

From LAY SERMONS, ADDRESSES, AND REVIEWS.

Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune of every one of us would, one day
or other, depend upon his winning or losing a game at chess. Don't you think that we should
all consider it to be a primary duty to learn at least the names and the moves of the pieces;
to have a notion of a gambit, and a keen eye for all the means of giving and getting out of
check? Do you not think that we should look with a disapprobation amounting to scorn, upon
the father who allowed his son, or the state which allowed its members, to grow up without
knowing a pawn from a knight?

Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth, that the life, the fortune, and the happiness
of every one of us, and, more or less, of those who are connected with us, do depend upon our
knowing something of the rules of a game infinitely more difficult and complicated than chess.
It is a game which has been played for untold ages, every man and woman of us being one of
the two players in a game of his or her own. The chess-board is the world, the pieces are the
phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The player
on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always fair, just, and patient.
But also we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance
for ignorance. To the man who plays well, the highest stakes are paid, with that sort of overflowing
generosity with which the strong shows delight in strength. And one who plays ill is checkmated--without
haste, but without remorse.

My metaphor will remind some of you of the famous picture in which Retzsch has depicted Satan
playing at chess with man for his soul. Substitute for the mocking fiend in that picture, a
calm, strong angel, who is playing for love, as we say, and would rather lose than win--and
I should accept it as an image of human life.

Well, what I mean by Education, is learning the rules of this mighty game. In other words,
education is the instruction of the intellect in the laws of Nature, under which name I include
not merely things and their forces, but men and their ways; and the fashioning of the affections
and of the will into an earnest and loving desire to move in harmony with those laws. For me,
education means neither more nor less than this. Anything which professes to call itself education
must be tried by this standard, and if it fails to stand the test, I will not call it education,
whatever may be the force of authority, or of numbers, upon the other side.

It is important to remember that, in strictness, there is no such thing as an uneducated man.
Take an extreme case. Suppose that an adult man, in the full vigor of his faculties, could
be suddenly placed in the world, as Adam is said to have been, and then left to do as he best
might. How long would he be left uneducated? Not five minutes. Nature would begin to teach
him, through the eye, the ear, the touch, the properties of objects. Pain and pleasure would
be at his elbow telling him to do this and avoid that; and by slow degrees the man would receive
an education, which, if narrow, would be thorough, real, and adequate to his circumstances,
though there would be no extras and very few accomplishments.

And if to this solitary man entered a second Adam, or, better still, an Eve, a new and greater
world, that of social and moral phenomena, would be revealed. Joys and woes, compared with
which all others might seem but faint shadows, would spring from the new relations. Happiness
and sorrow would take the place of the coarser monitors, pleasure and pain; but conduct would
still be shaped by the observation of the natural consequences of actions; or, in other words,
by the laws of the nature of man.

To every one of us the world was once as fresh and new as to Adam. And then, long before we
were susceptible of any other mode of instruction, Nature took us in hand, and every minute
of waking life brought its educational influence, shaping our actions into rough accordance
with Nature's laws, so that we might not be ended untimely by too gross disobedience. Nor should
I speak of this process of education as past for any one, be he as old as he may. For every
man, the world is as fresh as it was at the first day, and as full of untold novelties for
him who has the eyes to see them. And Nature is still continuing her patient education of us
in that great university, the universe, of which we are all members--Nature having no Test-Acts.

Those who take honors in Nature's university, who learn the laws which govern men and things,
and obey them, are the really great and successful men in this world. The great mass of mankind
are the "Poll," who pick up just enough to get through without much discredit. Those who won't
learn at all are plucked; and then you can't come up again. Nature's pluck means extermination.

Thus the question of compulsory education is settled so far as Nature is concerned. Her bill
on that question was framed and passed long ago. But, like all compulsory legislation, that
of Nature is harsh and wasteful in its operation. Ignorance is visited as sharply as wilful
disobedience--incapacity meets with the same punishment as crime. Nature's discipline is not
even a word and a blow, and the blow first; but the blow without the word. It is left to you
to find out why your ears are boxed.

The object of what we commonly call education--that education in which man intervenes and which
I shall distinguish as artificial education--is to make good these defects in Nature's methods;
to prepare the child to receive Nature's education, neither incapably nor ignorantly, nor with
wilful disobedience; and to understand the preliminary symptoms of her displeasure, without
waiting for the box on the ear. In short, all artificial education ought to be an anticipation
of natural education. And a liberal education is an artificial education, which has not only
prepared a man to escape the great evils of disobedience to natural laws, but has trained him
to appreciate and to seize upon the rewards which Nature scatters with as free a hand as her
penalties.

That man, I think, has had a liberal education, who has been so trained in youth that his body
is the ready servant of his will, and does with ease and pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism,
it is capable of; whose intellect is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts of equal
strength, and in smooth working order; ready, like a steam engine, to be turned to any kind
of work, and spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind; whose mind is stored
with a knowledge of the great and fundamental truths of Nature and of the laws of her operations;
one, who, no stunted ascetic, is full of life and fire, but whose passions are trained to come
to heel by a vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience; who has learned to love all
beauty, whether of Nature or of art, to hate all vileness, and to respect others as himself.

Such an one and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal education; for he is, as completely
as a man can be, in harmony with Nature. He will make the best of her, and she of him. They
will get on together rarely; she as his ever beneficent mother; he as her mouth-piece, her
conscious self, her minister and interpreter.

XCIV. TOO LATE.

DINAH MARIA MULOCK CRAIK.--1826-

    Could ye come back to me, Douglas, Douglas,
      In the old likeness that I knew,
    I would be so faithful, so loving, Douglas,
      Douglas, Douglas, tender and true.

    Never a scornful word should grieve ye,
      I'd smile on ye sweet as the angels do,--
    Sweet as your smile on me shone ever,
      Douglas, Douglas, tender and true.

    O to call back the days that are not!
      My eyes were blinded, your words were few;
    Do you know the truth now up in heaven,
      Douglas, Douglas, tender and true?

    I never was worthy of you, Douglas,
      Not half worthy the like of you;
    Now all men beside seem to me like shadows,--
      I love you, Douglas, tender and true.

    Stretch out your hand to me, Douglas, Douglas,
      Drop forgiveness from heaven like dew,
    As I lay my heart on your dead heart, Douglas,
      Douglas, Douglas, tender and true.

XCV. AMOR MUNDI.

CHRISTINA GEORGINA ROSSETTI.--1830-

    "O where are you going with your love-locks flowing,
      On the west wind blowing along this valley track?"
    "The down-hill path is easy, come with me an it please ye,
      We shall escape the up-hill by never turning back."

    So they two went together in glowing August weather,
      The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right;
    And dear she was to doat on, her swift feet seem'd to float on
      The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight.

    "Oh, what is that in heaven where grey cloud-flakes are seven,
      Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?"
    "Oh, that's a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous,
      An undecipher'd solemn signal of help or hurt."

    "Oh, what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly,
      Their scent comes rich and sickly?" "A scaled and hooded worm."
    "Oh, what's that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?"
      "Oh, that's a thin dead body which waits the eternal term."

    "Turn again, O my sweetest,--turn again, false and fleetest:
      This beaten way thou beatest, I fear is hell's own track."
    "Nay, too steep for hill mounting; nay, too late for cost counting:
      This down-hill path is easy, but there's no turning back."

XCVI. TOUJOURS AMOUR.

EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN.--1833-

      Prithee tell me, Dimple-Chin,
      At what age does love begin?
      Your blue eyes have scarcely seen
      Summers three, my fairy queen,
      But a miracle of sweets,
      Soft approaches, sly retreats,
      Show the little archer there,
      Hidden in your pretty hair;
      When didst learn a heart to win?
      Prithee tell me, Dimple-Chin!
      "Oh!" the rosy lips reply,
      "I can't tell you if I try.
    Tis so long I can't remember:
      Ask some younger lass than I."

      Tell, O tell me, Grizzled-Face,
      Do your heart and head keep pace?
      When does hoary Love expire,
      When do frosts put out the fire?
      Can its embers burn below
      All that chill December snow?
      Care you still soft hands to press,
      Bonny heads to smooth and bless?
      When does Love give up the chase?
      Tell, O tell me, Grizzled-Face!
      "Ah!" the wise old lips reply,
      "Youth may pass and strength may die;
    But of Love I can't foretoken:
      Ask some older sage than I!"

XCVII. ENGLAND.

THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH.--1836-

    While men pay reverence to mighty things,
    They must revere thee, thou blue-cinctured isle
    Of England--not to-day, but this long while
    In the front of nations, Mother of great kings,
    Soldiers, and poets. Round thee the Sea flings
    His steel-bright arm, and shields thee from the guile
    And hurt of France. Secure, with august smile,
    Thou sittest, and the East its tribute brings.
    Some say thy old-time power is on the wane,
    Thy moon of grandeur fill'd, contracts at length--
    They see it darkening down from less to less.
    Let but a hostile hand make threat again,
    And they shall see thee in thy ancient strength,
    Each iron sinew quivering, lioness!

       *       *       *       *       *

    Such kings of shreds have woo'd and won her,
      Such crafty knaves her laurel own'd,
    It has become almost an honor
      Not to be crown'd.

        THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH.
            On Popularity.

XCVIII. ROCOCO.

THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH.

    By studying my lady's eyes
      I've grown so learnèd day by day,
    So Machiavelian in this wise,
      That when I send her flowers, I say

    To each small flower (no matter what,
      Geranium, pink, or tuberose,
    Syringa, or forget-me-not,
      Or violet) before it goes:

    "Be not triumphant, little flower,
      When on her haughty heart you lie,
    But modestly enjoy your hour:
      She'll weary of you by-and-by."

XCIX. KINGS OF MEN.

JOHN READE.--1837-

    As hills seem Alps, when veil'd in misty shroud,
      Some men seem kings, through mists of ignorance;
    Must we have darkness, then, and cloud on cloud,
      To give our hills and pigmy kings a chance?
    Must we conspire to curse the humbling light,
      Lest some one, at whose feet our fathers bow'd,
    Should suddenly appear, full length, in sight,
      Scaring to laughter the adoring crowd?
    Oh, no! God send us light!--Who loses then?
      The king of slaves and not the king of men.
    True kings are kings for ever, crown'd of God,
      The King of Kings,--we need not fear for them.
    'Tis only the usurper's diadem
      That shakes at touch of light, revealing fraud.

C. THALATTA! THALATTA!

JOHN READE.

    In my ear is the moan of the pines--in my heart is the song of
              the sea,
    And I feel his salt breath on my face as he showers his kisses
              on me,
    And I hear the wild scream of the gulls, as they answer the call
              of the tide,
    And I watch the fair sails as they glisten like gems on the breast
              of a bride.

    From the rock where I stand to the sun is a pathway of sapphire
              and gold,
    Like a waif of those Patmian visions that wrapt the lone seer
              of old,
    And it seems to my soul like an omen that calls me far over
              the sea--
    But I think of a little white cottage and one that is dearest to me.

    Westward ho! Far away to the East is a cottage that looks to
              the shore,--
    Though each drop in the sea were a tear, as it was, I can see it
              no more;
    For the heart of its pride with the flowers of the "Vale of the
              Shadow" reclines,
    And--hush'd is the song of the sea and hoarse is the moan of
              the pines.

CI. THE FORSAKEN GARDEN.

ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE.--1837-

    In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,
      At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee,
    Wall'd round with rocks as an inland island,
      The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.
    A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses
      The steep square slope of the blossomless bed
    Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses
          Now lie dead.

    The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,
      To the low last edge of the long lone land.
    If a step should sound or a word be spoken,
      Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?
    So long have the gray bare walks lain guestless,
      Through branches and briers if a man make way,
    He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless
          Night and day.

    The dense hard passage is blind and stifled,
      That crawls by a track none turn to climb
    To the strait waste place that the years have rifled
      Of all but the thorns that are touch'd not of time.
    The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;
      The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.
    The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,
          These remain.

    Not a flower to be prest of the foot that falls not;
      As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;
    From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,
      Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.
    Over the meadows that blossom and wither
      Rings but the note of sea-bird's song;
    Only the sun and the rain come hither
          All year long.

    The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels
      One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.
    Only the wind here hovers and revels
      In a round where life seems barren as death.
    Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,
      Haply, of lovers none ever will know,
    Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping
          Years ago.

    Heart handfast in heart as they stood, "Look thither,"
      Did he whisper? "Look forth from the flowers to the sea;
    For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,
      And men that love lightly may die--but we?"
    And the same wind sang and the same waves whiten'd,
      And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,
    In the lips that had whisper'd, the eyes that had lighten'd,
          Love was dead.

    Or they lov'd their life through, and then went whither?
      And were one to the end--but what end who knows?
    Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,
      As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.
    Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?
      What love was ever as deep as a grave?
    They are loveless now as the grass above them
          Or the wave.

    All are at one now, roses and lovers,
      Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea.
    Not a breath of the time that has been hovers
      In the air now soft with a summer to be.
    Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter
      Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,
    When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter
          We shall sleep.

    Here death may deal not again for ever;
      Here change may come not till all change end.
    From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,
      Who have left nought living to ravage and rend.
    Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing,
      When the sun and the rain live, these shall be;
    Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing
          Roll the sea.

    Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,
      Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,
    Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble
      The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,
    Here now in his triumph where all things falter,
      Stretch'd out on the spoils that his own hand spread,
    As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,
          Death lies dead.

CII. A BALLAD TO QUEEN ELIZABETH OF THE SPANISH ARMADA.

(BALLADE.)

AUSTIN DOBSON.--1840-

    King Philip had vaunted his claims;
      He had sworn for a year he would sack us;
    With an army of heathenish names
      He was coming to fagot and stack us;
    Like the thieves of the sea he would track us,
      And shatter our ships on the main;
    But we had bold Neptune to back us,--
      And where are the galleons of Spain?

    His carackes were christen'd of dames
      To the kirtles whereof he would tack us;
    With his saints and his gilded stern-frames,
      He had thought like an egg-shell to crack us;
      Now Howard may get to his Flaccus,
    And Drake to his Devon again,
      And Hawkins bowl rubbers to Bacchus,--
    For where are the galleons of Spain?

    Let his Majesty hang to St. James
      The axe that he whetted to hack us;
    He must play at some lustier games
      Or at sea he can hope to out-thwack us;
      To his mines of Peru he would pack us
    To tug at his bullet and chain;
      Alas! that his Greatness should lack us!--
    But where are the galleons of Spain?

          ENVOY.

        GLORIANA!--the Don may attack us
      Whenever his stomach be fain;
      He must reach us before he can rack us, ...
    And where are the galleons of Spain?

       *       *       *       *       *

    He lives not best who dreads the coming pain
      And shunneth each delight desirable:
    FLEE THOU EXTREMES, this word alone is plain,
      Of all that God hath given to Man to spell!

        ANDREW LANG.--1844.

CIV. SCENES FROM "TECUMSEH."[Q]

CHARLES MAIR.--1840-

SCENE.--TECUMSEH'S Cabin.

Enter IENA.

Iena. 'Tis night, and Mamatee is absent still! Why should this sorrow weigh upon my heart,
And other lonely things on earth have rest? Oh, could I be with them! The lily shone All day
upon the stream, and now it sleeps Under the wave in peace--in cradle soft Which sorrow soon
may fashion for my grave. Ye shadows which do creep into my thoughts-- Ye curtains of despair!
what is my fault, That ye should hide the happy earth from me? Once I had joy of it, when tender
Spring, Mother of beauty, hid me in her leaves; When Summer led me by the shores of song, And
forests and far-sounding cataracts Melted my soul with music. I have heard The rough chill
harpings of dismantled woods, When Fall had stripp'd them, and have felt a joy Deeper than
ear could lend unto the heart; And when the Winter from his mountains wild Look'd down on death,
and, in the frosty sky, The very stars seem'd hung with icicles, Then came a sense of beauty
calm and cold, That wean'd me from myself, yet knit me still With kindred bonds to Nature.
All is past, And he--who won from me such love for him, And he--my valiant uncle and my friend,
Comes not to lift the cloud that drapes my soul, And shield me from the fiendish Prophet's power.

Enter MAMATEE.

Give me his answer in his very words!

Mamatee. There is a black storm raging in his mind-- His eye darts lightning like the angry
cloud Which hangs in woven darkness o'er the earth. Brief is his answer--you must go to him.
The Long-Knife's camp-fires gleam among the oaks Which dot yon western hill. A thousand men
Are sleeping there cajoled to fatal dreams By promises the Prophet breaks to-night. Hark! 'tis
the war-song.

Iena.                  Dares the Prophet now Betray Tecumseh's trust, and break his faith?

Mamatee. He dares do anything will feed ambition. His dancing braves are frenzied by his tongue,
Which prophesies revenge and victory. Before the break of day he will surprise The Long-Knife's
camp, and hang our people's fate Upon a single onset.

Iena.              Should he fail?

Mamatee. Then all will fail;--Tecumseh's scheme will fail.[R]

Iena. It shall not! Let us go to him at once!

Mamatee. And risk your life?

Iena.                        Risk hovers everywhere When night and man combine for darksome
deeds. I'll go to him, and argue on my knees-- Yea, yield my hand--would I could give my heart
To stay his purpose and this act of ruin.

Mamatee. He is not in the mood for argument. Rash girl! they die who would oppose him now.

Iena. Such death were sweet as life--I go! But, first-- Great Spirit! I commit my soul to Thee.
[Kneels.

SCENE.--An open space in the forest near the Prophet's Town. A fire of billets burning. War-cries
are heard from the town.

Enter the PROPHET.

Prophet. My spells do work apace! Shout yourselves hoarse,
Ye howling ministers by whom I climb!
For this I've wrought until my weary tongue,
Blister'd with incantation, flags in speech,
And half declines its office. Every brave
Inflamed by charms and oracles, is now
A vengeful serpent, who will glide ere morn
To sting the Long-Knife's sleeping camp to death.
Why should I hesitate? My promises!
My duty to Tecumseh! What are these
Compared with duty here? Where I perceive
A near advantage, there my duty lies;
Consideration strong which overweighs
All other reason. Here is Harrison--
Trepann'd to dangerous lodgment for the night--
Each deep ravine which grooves the prairie's breast
A channel of approach; each winding creek
A screen for creeping death. Revenge is sick
To think of such advantage flung aside.
For what? To let Tecumseh's greatness grow,
Who gathers his rich harvest of renown
Out of the very fields that I have sown!
By Manitou, I will endure no more!
Nor, in the rising flood of our affairs,
Fish like an osprey for this eagle longer.
                                           But, soft!
It is the midnight hour when comes
Tarhay to claim his bride. [Calls.] Tarhay! Tarhay!

Enter TARHAY with several braves.

Tarhay. Tarhay is here!

Prophet.                The Long-Knives die to-night. The spirits which do minister to me Have
breathed this utterance within my ear. You know my sacred office cuts me off From the immediate
leadership in fight. My nobler work is in the spirit-world, And thence come promises which
make us strong. Near to the foe I'll keep the Magic Bowl, Whilst you, Tarhay, shall lead our
warriors on.

Tarhay. I'll lead them; they are wild with eagerness. But fill my cold and empty cabin first
With light and heat! You know I love your niece, And have the promise of her hand to-night.

Prophet. She shall be yours!
            [To the braves.] Go bring her here at once--
But, look! Fulfilment of my promise comes
In her own person.

Enter IENA and MAMATEE.

                   Welcome, my sweet niece!
You have forstall'd my message by these braves,
And come unbidden to your wedding-place.

Iena. Uncle! you know my heart is far away--

Prophet. But still your hand is here! this little hand!
                                    [Pulling her forward.

Iena. Dare you enforce a weak and helpless girl, Who thought to move you by her misery? Stand
back! I have a message for you too. What means the war-like song, the dance of braves, And
bustle in our town?

Prophet.              It means that we Attack the foe to-night.

Iena.                  And risk our all? O that Tecumseh knew! his soul would rush In arms
to intercept you. What! break faith, And on the hazard of a doubtful strife, Stake his great
enterprise and all our lives! The dying curses of a ruin'd race Will wither up your wicked
heart for this!

Prophet. False girl! your heart is with our foes; Your hand I mean to turn to better use.

Iena. Oh, could it turn you from your mad intent How freely would I give it! Drop this scheme,
Dismiss your frenzied warriors to their beds; And, if contented with my hand, Tarhay Can have
it here.

Tarhay.         I love you, Iena!

Iena. Then must you love what I do! Love our race! 'Tis this love nerves Tecumseh to unite
Its scatter'd tribes--his fruit of noble toil, Which you would snatch unripen'd from his hand,
And feed to sour ambition. Touch it not-- Oh, touch it not, Tarhay! and though my heart Breaks
for it, I am yours.

Prophet.                 His anyway, Or I am not the Prophet!

Tarhay.                For my part I have no leaning to this rash attempt, Since Iena consents
to be my wife.

Prophet. Shall I be thwarted by a yearning fool!      [Aside. This soft, sleek girl, to outward
seeming good, I know to be a very fiend beneath-- Whose sly affections centre on herself, And
feed the gliding snake within her heart.

Tarhay. I cannot think her so--

Mamatee.                        She is not so! There is the snake that creeps among our race;
Whose venom'd fangs would bile into our lives, And poison all our hopes.

Prophet.                She is the head-- The very neck of danger to me here, Which I must
break at once! [Aside.] Tarhay--attend! I can see dreadful visions in the air; I can dream
awful dreams of life and fate; I can bring darkness on the heavy earth; I can fetch shadows
from our fathers' graves, And spectres from the sepulchres of hell. Who dares dispute with
me, disputes with death! Dost hear, Tarhay?

[TARHAY and braves cower before the PROPHET.

Tarhay.          I hear, and will obey. Spare me! Spare me!

Prophet.          As for this foolish girl, The hand she offers you on one condition, I give
to you upon a better one; And, since she has no mind to give her heart-- Which, rest assured,
is in her body still-- There,--take it at my hands!

[Flings IENA violently towards TARHAY, into whose arms she falls fainting, and is then borne
away by MAMATEE.

[To TARHAY.] Go bring the braves to view the Mystic Torch And belt of Sacred Beans grown from
my flesh-- One touch of it makes them invulnerable-- Then creep, like stealthy panthers, on
the foe!

SCENE.--Morning. The field of Tippecanoe after the battle. The ground strewn with dead soldiers
and warriors.

Enter HARRISON, officers and soldiers, and BARRON.

Harrison. A costly triumph reckon'd by our slain! Look how some lie still clench'd with savages
In all-embracing death, their bloody hands Glued in each other's hair! Make burial straight
Of all alike in deep and common graves: Their quarrel now is ended.

1st Officer.              I have heard The red man fears our steel--'twas not so here; From
the first shots, which drove our pickets in, Till daylight dawn'd, they rush'd upon our lines,
And flung themselves upon our bayonet points In frenzied recklessness of bravery.

Barron. They trusted in the Prophet's rites and spells, Which promis'd them immunity from death.
All night he sat on yon safe eminence, Howling his songs of war and mystery, Then fled, at
dawn, in fear of his own braves.

Enter an AIDE.

Harrison. What tidings bring you from the Prophet's Town?

Aide. The wretched women with their children fly To distant forests for concealment. In Their
village is no living thing save mice Which scamper'd as we oped each cabin door. Their pots
still simmer'd on the vacant hearths, Standing in dusty silence and desertion. Naught else
we saw, save that their granaries Were cramm'd with needful corn.

Harrison.                     Go bring it all-- Then burn their village down!      [Exit AIDE.

2nd Officer.                This victory Will shake Tecumseh's project to the base. Were I
the Prophet I should drown myself Rather than meet him.

Barron.             We have news of him-- Our scouts report him near in heavy force.

Harrison. 'Twill melt, or draw across the British line, And wait for war. But double the night
watch, Lest he should strike, and give an instant care To all our wounded men: to-morrow's
sun Must light us on our backward march for home. Thence Rumor's tongue will spread so proud
a story New England will grow envious of our glory; And, greedy for renown so long abhorr'd,
Will on old England draw the tardy sword!

SCENE.--The Ruins of the Prophet's Town.

Enter the PROPHET, who gloomily surveys the place.

Prophet. Our people scatter'd, and our town in ashes! To think these hands could work such
madness here-- This envious head devise this misery! Tecumseh, had not my ambition drawn Such
sharp and fell destruction on our race You might have smiled at me! for I have match'd My cunning
'gainst your wisdom, and have dragg'd Myself and all into a sea of ruin.

Enter TECUMSEH.

Tecumseh. Devil! I have discover'd you at last! You sum of treacheries, whose wolfish fangs
Have torn our people's flesh--you shall not live!

[The PROPHET retreats facing and followed by TECUMSEH.

Prophet. Nay--strike me not! I can explain it all! It was a woman touch'd the Magic Bowl, And
broke the brooding spell.

Tecumseh.                   Impostor! Slave! Why should I spare you?      [Lifts his hand as
if to strike.

Prophet.              Stay, stay, touch me not! One mother bore us in the self-same hour.

Tecumseh. Then good and evil came to light together.
Go to the corn-dance, change your name to villain!
Away! Your presence tempts my soul to mischief.
                                          [Exit the PROPHET hastily.
Would that I were a woman, and could weep,
And slake hot rage with tears! O spiteful fortune,
To lure me to the limit of my dreams,
Then turn and crowd the ruin of my toil
Into the narrow compass of a night!
My brother's deep disgrace--myself the scorn
Of envious harriers and thieves of fame,
Who fain would rob me of the lawful meed
Of faithful services and duties done--
Oh, I could bear it all! But to behold
Our ruin'd people hunted to their graves--
To see the Long-Knife triumph in their shame--
This is the burning shaft, the poison'd wound
That rankles in my soul! But, why despair?
All is not lost--the English are our friends.
My spirit rises--manhood bear me up!
I'll haste to Malden, join my force to theirs,
And fall with double fury on our foes.
Farewell ye plains and forests, but rejoice!
Ye yet shall echo to Tecumseh's voice.

Enter LEFROY.

Lefroy. What tidings have you glean'd of Iena?

Tecumseh. My brother meant to wed her to Tarhay-- The chief who led his warriors to ruin; But,
in the gloom and tumult of the night, She fled into the forest all alone.

Lefroy. Alone! In the wide forest all alone! Angels are with her now, for she is dead.

Tecumseh. You know her to be skilful with the bow. 'Tis certain she would strike for some great
Lake-- Erie or Michigan. At the Detroit Are people of our nation, and perchance She fled for
shelter there. I go at once To join the British force.      [Exit TECUMSEH.

Lefroy.                  But yesterday I climb'd to Heaven upon the shining stairs Of love
and hope, and here am quite cast down. My little flower amidst a weedy world, Where art thou
now? In deepest forest shade? Or onward, where the sumach stands array'd In autumn splendor,
its alluring form Fruited, yet odious with the hidden worm? Or, farther, by some still sequester'd
lake, Loon-haunted, where the sinewy panthers slake Their noon-day thirst, and never voice
is heard Joyous of singing waters, breeze or bird, Save their wild wailings.--[A halloo without.]
'Tis Tecumseh calls! Oh Iena! If dead, where'er thou art-- Thy saddest grave will be this ruin'd
heart!      [Exit.

FOOTNOTES:

[Q] These scenes are enacted at the "Prophet's Town," an Indian village, situated at the junction
of the Tippecanoe river with the Wabash, the latter a tributary of the Ohio. Tecumseh is gone
on a mission to the Southern Indians to induce them to unite in a confederation of all the
Indian tribes, leaving his brother, the Prophet, in charge of the tribes already assembled,
having strictly enjoined upon him not to quarrel with the Americans, or Long-Knives, as the
Indians called them, during his absence. General Harrison, Governor of Indiana, and commander
of the American forces, having learned of Tecumseh's plans, marches to attack the Prophet;
but the latter, pretending to be friendly, sends out some chiefs to meet Harrison. By the advice
of these chiefs, the Americans encamp on an elevated plateau, near the Prophet's Town,--"a
very fitting place," to the mind of Harrison's officers, but to the practised eye of Harrison
himself, also well fitted for a night attack by the Indians. He, therefore, very wisely makes
all necessary preparations for defence against any sudden attack. Tecumseh has left behind
him, under the protection of the Prophet, his wife, Mamatee, and his niece, Iena. He is accompanied
on his mission by Lefroy, an English poet-artist, "enamoured of Indian life, and in love with
Iena." The Prophet, who is hostile to Lefroy, intends to marry Iena to Tarhay, one of his chiefs,
but Mamatee has gone to intercede with her brother-in-law for Iena, and, if possible, to turn
him from his purpose.

[R] Tecumseh had long foreseen that nothing but combination could prevent the encroachments
of the whites upon the Ohio, and had long been successfully endeavoring to bring about a union
of the tribes who inhabited its valley. The Fort Wayne treaties gave a wider scope to his design,
and he now originated his great scheme of a federation of the entire red race. In pursuance
of this object, his exertions, hitherto very arduous, became almost superhuman. He made repeated
journeys, and visited almost every tribe from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes, and even
north of them, and far to the west of the Mississippi. In order to further his scheme he took
advantage of his brother's growing reputation as a prophet, and allowed him to gain a powerful
hold upon the superstitious minds of his people by his preaching and predictions. The Prophet
professed to have obtained from the Great Spirit a magic bowl, which possessed miraculous qualities;
also a mystic torch, presumably from Nanabush, the keeper of the sacred fire. He asserted that
a certain belt, said to make those invulnerable who touched it whilst in his hands, was composed
of beans which had grown from his flesh; and this belt was circulated far and wide by Indian
runners, finding its way even to the Red River of the North. These, coupled with his oratory
and mummeries, greatly enhanced an influence which was possibly added to by a gloomy and saturnine
countenance, made more forbidding still by the loss of an eye. Unfortunately for Tecumseh's
enterprise, the Prophet was more bent upon personal notoriety than upon the welfare of his
people; and, whilst professing the latter, indulged his ambition, in Tecumseh's absence, by
a precipitate attack upon Harrison's force on the Tippecanoe. His defeat discredited his assumption
of supernatural powers, led to distrust and defection, and wrecked Tecumseh's plan of independent
action. But the protection of his people was Tecumseh's sole ambition; and, true statesman
that he was, he joined the British at Amherstburg (Fort Malden), in Upper Canada, with a large
force, and in the summer of 1812 began that series of services to the British interest which
has made his name a household word in Canada, and endeared him to the Canadian heart.--From
AUTHOR'S NOTE.

CV. THE RETURN OF THE SWALLOWS.

EDMUND WILLIAM GOSSE.--1849-

    "Out in the meadows the young grass springs,
      Shivering with sap," said the larks, "and we
    Shoot into air with our strong young wings
      Spirally up over level and lea;
    Come, O Swallows, and fly with us
    Now that horizons are luminous!
      Evening and morning the world of light,
      Spreading and kindling, is infinite!"

    Far away, by the sea in the south,
      The hills of olive and slopes of fern
    Whiten and glow in the sun's long drouth,
      Under the heavens that beam and burn;
    And all the swallows were gather'd there
    Flitting about in the fragrant air,
      And heard no sound from the larks, but flew
      Flashing under the blinding blue.

    Out of the depths of their soft rich throats
      Languidly fluted the thrushes, and said:
    "Musical thought in the mild air floats,
      Spring is coming and winter is dead!
    Come, O Swallows, and stir the air,
    For the buds are all bursting unaware,
      And the drooping eaves and the elm-trees long
      To hear the sound of your low sweet song."

    Over the roofs of the white Algiers,
      Flashingly shadowing the bright bazaar,
    Flitted the swallows, and not one hears
      The call of the thrushes from far, from far;
    Sigh'd the thrushes; then, all at once,
    Broke out singing the old sweet tones,
      Singing the bridal of sap and shoot,
      The tree's slow life between root and fruit.

    But just when the dingles of April flowers
      Shine with the earliest daffodils,
    When, before sunrise, the cold clear hours
      Gleam with a promise that noon fulfils,--
    Deep in the leafage the cuckoo cried,
    Perch'd on a spray by a rivulet-side,
      "Swallows, O Swallows, come back again
      To swoop and herald the April rain."

    And something awoke in the slumbering heart
      Of the alien birds in their African air,
    And they paused, and alighted, and twitter'd apart,
      And met in the broad white dreamy square;
    And the sad slave woman, who lifted up
    From the fountain her broad-lipp'd earthen cup,
      Said to herself, with a weary sigh,
      "To-morrow the swallows will northward fly!"

CVI. DAWN ANGELS.

A. MARY F. ROBINSON.--1856-

    All night I watch'd, awake, for morning:
      At last the East grew all aflame,
    The birds for welcome sang, or warning,
      And with their singing morning came.

    Along the gold-green heavens drifted
      Pale wandering souls that shun the light,
    Whose cloudy pinions, torn and rifted,
      Had beat the bars of Heaven all night.

    These cluster'd round the Moon; but higher
      A troop of shining spirits went,
    Who were not made of wind or fire,
      But some divine dream-element.

    Some held the Light, while those remaining
      Shook out their harvest-color'd wings,
    A faint unusual music raining
      (Whose sound was Light) on earthly things.

    They sang, and as a mighty river
      Their voices wash'd the night away:
    From East to West ran one white shiver,
      And waxen strong their song was Day.

CVII. LE ROI EST MORT.

A. MARY F. ROBINSON.

    And shall I weep that Love's no more,
    And magnify his reign?
    Sure never mortal man before
        Would have his grief again.
    Farewell the long-continued ache,
    The days a-dream, the nights awake,
    I will rejoice and merry make,
        And never more complain.

    King Love is dead and gone for aye,
    Who ruled with might and main,
    For with a bitter word one day,
        I found my tyrant slain,
    And he in Heathenesse was bred,
    Nor ever was baptized, 'tis said,
    Nor is of any creed, and dead
        Can never rise again.

CVIII. TO WINTER.

CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS.--1859-

    Ruling with an iron hand
    O'er the intermediate land
    'Twixt the plains of rich completeness,
    And the realms of budding sweetness,
    Winter! from thy crystal throne,
    With a keenness all thy own
    Dartest thou, through gleaming air,
    O'er the glorious barren glare
    Of thy sunlit wildernesses,
    Thine undazzled level glances,
    Where thy minions' silver tresses
    Stream among their icy lances;
    While thy universal breathing,
    Frozen to a radiant swathing
    For the trees, their bareness hides,
    And upon their sunward sides
    Shines and flushes rosily
    To the chill pink morning sky.
    Skilful artists thou employest,
    And in chastest beauty joyest--
    Forms most delicate, pure, and clear,
    Frost-caught starbeams fallen sheer
    In the night, and woven here
    In jewel-fretted tapestries.
    But what magic melodies,
    As in the bord'ring realms are throbbing,
    Hast thou, Winter?--Liquid sobbing
    Brooks, and brawling waterfalls,
    Whose responsive-voicèd calls
    Clothe with harmony the hills,
    Gurgling meadow-threading rills,
    Lakelets' lisping wavelets lapping
    Round a flock of wild ducks napping,
    And the rapturous-noted wooings,
    And the molten-throated cooings,
    Of the amorous multitudes
    Flashing through the dusky woods,
    When a veering wind hath blown
    A glare of sudden daylight down?--
    Naught of these!--And fewer notes
    Hath the wind alone that floats
    Over naked trees and snows;
    Half its minstrelsy it owes
    To its orchestra of leaves.
    Ay! weak the meshes music weaves
    For thy snarèd soul's delight,
    'Less, when thou dost lie at night
    'Neath the star-sown heavens bright,
    To thy sin-unchokèd ears
    Some dim harmonies may pierce
    From the high-consulting spheres:
    'Less the silent sunrise sing
    Like a vibrant silver string
    When its prison'd splendors first
    O'er the crusted snow-fields burst.
    But thy days the silence keep,
    Save for grosbeaks' feeble cheep,
    Or for snow-birds' busy twitter
    When thy breath is very bitter.

    So my spirit often acheth
    For the melodies it lacketh
    'Neath thy sway, or cannot hear
    For its mortal-cloakèd ear.
    And full thirstily it longeth
    For the beauty that belongeth
    To the Autumn's ripe fulfilling;--
    Heapèd orchard-baskets spilling
    'Neath the laughter-shaken trees;
    Fields of buckwheat full of bees,
    Girt with ancient groves of fir
    Shod with berried juniper;
    Beech-nuts mid their russet leaves;
    Heavy-headed nodding sheaves;
    Clumps of luscious blackberries;
    Purple-cluster'd traceries
    Of the cottage climbing-vines;
    Scarlet-fruited eglantines;
    Maple forests all aflame
    When thy sharp-tongued legates came.

    Ruler with an iron hand
    O'er an intermediate land!
    Glad am I thy realm is border'd
    By the plains more richly order'd,--
    Stock'd with sweeter-glowing forms,--
    Where the prison'd brightness warms
    In lush crimsons through the leaves,
    And a gorgeous legend weaves.

CIX. ABIGAIL BECKER.

(Off Long Point Island, Lake Erie, November 24th, 1854.)

AMANDA T. JONES.

    The wind, the wind where Erie plunged,
      Blew, blew nor'-east from land to land;
    The wandering schooner dipp'd and lunged,--
      Long Point was close at hand.

    Long Point--a swampy island-slant,
      Where, busy in their grassy homes,
    Woodcock and snipe the hollows haunt,
      And musk-rats build their domes;

    Where gulls and eagles rest at need,
      Where either side, by lake or sound,
    Kingfishers, cranes, and divers feed,
      And mallard ducks abound.

    The lowering night shut out the sight:
      Careen'd the vessel, pitch'd and veer'd,--
    Raved, raved the wind with main and might;
      The sunken reef she near'd.

    She pounded over, lurch'd, and sank;
      Between two sand-bars settling fast,
    Her leaky hull the waters drank,
      And she had sail'd her last.

    Into the rigging, quick as thought,
      Captain and mate and sailors sprung,
    Clamber'd for life, some vantage caught,
      And there all night they swung.

    And it was cold--oh, it was cold!
      The pinching cold was like a vise:
    Spoondrift flew freezing,--fold on fold
      It coated them with ice.

    Now when the dawn began to break,
      Light up the sand-path drench'd and brown,
    To fill her bucket from the lake,
      Came Mother Becker down.

    From where her cabin crown'd the bank
      Came Abigail Becker tall and strong:
    She dipp'd, and lo! a broken plank
      Came rocking close along!

    She pois'd her glass with anxious ken:
      The schooner's top she spied from far,
    And there she counted seven men
      That clung to mast and spar.

    And oh, the gale! the rout and roar!
      The blinding drift, the mounting wave,
    A good half-mile from wreck to shore,
      With seven men to save!

    Sped Mother Becker: "Children! wake!
      A ship's gone down! they're needing me!
    Your father's off on shore; the lake
      Is just a raging sea!

    "Get wood, cook fish, make ready all."
      She snatch'd her stores, she fled with haste,
    In cotton gown and tatter'd shawl,
      Barefoot across the waste,

    Through sinking sands, through quaggy lands,
      And nearer, nearer, full in view,
    Went shouting through her hollow'd hands:
      "Courage! we'll get you through!"

    Ran to and fro, made cheery signs,
      Her bonfire lighted, steeped her tea,
    Brought drift-wood, watch'd Canadian lines
      Her husband's boat to see.

    Cold, cold it was--oh, it was cold!
      The bitter cold made watching vain:
    With ice the channel laboring roll'd,--
      No skiff could stand the strain.

    On all that isle, from outer swell
      To strait between the landings shut,
    Was never place where man might dwell,
      Save trapper Becker's hut.

    And it was twelve and one and two,
      And it was three o'clock and more.
    She call'd: "Come on! there's nought to do,
      But leap and swim ashore!"

    Blew, blew the gale; they did not hear:
      She waded in the shallow sea;
    She waved her hands, made signals clear,
      "Swim! swim, and trust to me!"

    "My men," the captain cried, "I'll try:
      The woman's judgment may be right;
    For, swim or sink, seven men must die
      If here we swing to-night."

    Far out he mark'd the gathering surge;
      Across the bar he watch'd it pour,
    Let go, and on its topmost verge
      Came riding in to shore.

    It struck the breaker's foamy track,--
      Majestic wave on wave uphurl'd,
    Went grandly toppling, tumbling back,
      As loath to flood the world.

    There blindly whirling, shorn of strength,
      The captain drifted, sure to drown;
    Dragg'd seaward half a cable's length,
      Like sinking lead went down.

    Ah, well for him that on the strand
      Had Mother Becker waited long!
    And well for him her grasping hand
      And grappling arm were strong!

    And well for him that wind and sun,
      And daily toil for scanty gains,
    Had made such daring blood to run
      Within such generous veins!

    For what to do but plunge and swim?
      Out on the sinking billow cast,
    She toil'd, she dived, she groped for him,
      She found and clutch'd him fast.

    She climb'd the reef, she brought him up,
      She laid him gasping on the sands;
    Built high the fire and fill'd the cup,--
      Stood up and waved her hands!

    Oh, life is dear! The mate leap'd in.
      "I know," the captain said, "right well,
    Not twice can any woman win
      A soul from yonder hell.

    "I'll start and meet him in the wave."
      "Keep back!" she bade: "what strength have you?
    And I shall have you both to save,--
      Must work to pull you through!"

    But out he went. Up shallow sweeps
      Raced the long white-caps, comb on comb:
    The wind, the wind that lash'd the deeps,
      Far, far it blew the foam.

    The frozen foam went scudding by,--
      Before the wind, a seething throng,
    The waves, the waves came towering high,
      They flung the mate along.

    The waves came towering high and white.
      They burst in clouds of flying spray:
    There mate and captain sank from sight,
      And, clinching, roll'd away.

    Oh, Mother Becker, seas are dread,
      Their treacherous paths are deep and blind!
    But widows twain shall mourn their dead
      If thou art slow to find.

    She sought them near, she sought them far,
      Three fathoms down she gripp'd them tight;
    With both together up the bar
      She stagger'd into sight.

    Beside the fire her burdens fell:
      She paus'd the cheering draught to pour,
    Then waved her hands: "All's well! all's well!
      Come on! swim! swim ashore!"

    Sure, life is dear, and men are brave:
      They came,--they dropp'd from mast and spar;
    And who but she could breast the wave,
      And dive beyond the bar?

    Dark grew the sky from east to west,
      And darker, darker grew the world:
    Each man from off the breaker's crest
      To gloomier deeps was hurl'd.

    And still the gale went shrieking on,
      And still the wrecking fury grew;
    And still the woman, worn and wan,
      Those gates of Death went through,--

    As Christ were walking on the waves,
      And heavenly radiance shone about,--
    All fearless trod that gulf of graves
      And bore the sailors out.

    Down came the night, but far and bright,
      Despite the wind and flying foam,
    The bonfire flamed to give them light
      To trapper Becker's home.

    Oh, safety after wreck is sweet!
      And sweet is rest in hut or hall:
    One story Life and Death repeat,--
      God's mercy over all.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Next day men heard, put out from shore,
      Cross'd channel-ice, burst in to find
    Seven gallant fellows sick and sore,
      A tender nurse and kind;

    Shook hands, wept, laugh'd, were crazy-glad;
      Cried: "Never yet, on land or sea,
    Poor dying, drowning sailors had
      A better friend than she.

    "Billows may tumble, winds may roar,
      Strong hands the wreck'd from Death may snatch:
    But never, never, nevermore
      This deed shall mortal match!"

    Dear Mother Becker dropp'd her head,
      She blush'd as girls when lovers woo:
    "I have not done a thing," she said,
      "More than I ought to do."

THE END.
