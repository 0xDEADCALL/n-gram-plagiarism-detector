Old Booty's Case (Vol. iii., p. 40.).--The most authentic report of this case is, I think,
in one of the London Gazettes for 1687 or 1688. I read the report in one of these at the British
Museum several years ago. It purported to be given only a few days after the trial had taken place.

HISTORY OF ANCIENT WILTS, by Sir R. C. HOARE. The last three Parts.

Being anxious to include as many Replies as possible in our present Number, in order that they
may be found in the same Volume with the Queries to which they relate, we have omitted for
this week our usual PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE, as well as our NOTES ON BOOKS, and several
interesting articles, which are in type.

MR. LYTE's Treatment of Positives shall appear next week.

C. MANSFIELD INGLEBY.--The passage---

 "The soul's dark cottage," &c.

is from Waller. See some curious illustrations of it in our 3rd Vol., pp. 154, 155.

W. EWART. We should he glad to have an opportunity of looking at the collection of Epithets
to which our correspondent refers.

JARLTZBERG's Query in our next. His other articles shall have early attention.

JUVENIS. We must repeat that we cannot undertake the invidious task of recommending our Correspondents
where to purchase their photographic apparatus and materials. Our advertising columns give
ample information. The demand for cheap apparatus, if it becomes general, will be sure to be
supplied.

Errata.--P. 569. col. 1. l. 45., for "ooyddes" read "Ovyddes." P. 548 col. 2. l. 47, for "1550"
read "1850."

the 16th, when we shall also publish our Seventh Volume, Price 10s. 6d., cloth, boards.
