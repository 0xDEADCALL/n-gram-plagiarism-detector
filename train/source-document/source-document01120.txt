A COMPILATION OF THE MESSAGES AND PAPERS OF THE PRESIDENTS

BY JAMES D. RICHARDSON

Andrew Johnson

April 15, 1865, to March 4, 1869

Andrew Johnson

Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, N.C., December 29, 1808. His parents were very poor. When
he was 4 years old his father died of injuries received in rescuing a person from drowning.
At the age of 10 years Andrew was apprenticed to a tailor. His early education was almost entirely
neglected, and, notwithstanding his natural craving to learn, he never spent a day in school.
Was taught the alphabet by a fellow-workman, borrowed a book, and learned to read. In 1824
removed to Laurens Court-House, S.C., where he worked as a journeyman tailor. In May, 1826,
returned to Raleigh, and in September, with his mother and stepfather, set out for Greeneville,
Tenn., in a two-wheeled cart drawn by a blind pony. Here he married Eliza McCardle, a woman
of refinement, who taught him to write, and read to him while he was at work during the day.
It was not until he had been in Congress that he learned to write with ease. From Greeneville
went to the West, but returned after the lapse of a year. In 1828 was elected alderman; was
reelected in 1829 and 1830, and in 1830 was advanced to the mayoralty, which office he held
for three years. In 1831 was appointed by the county court a trustee of Rhea Academy, and about
this time participated in the debates of a society at Greeneville College. In 1834 advocated
the adoption of a new State constitution, by which the influence of the large landholders was
abridged. In 1835 represented Greene and Washington counties in the legislature. Was defeated
for the legislature in 1837, but in 1839 was reelected. In 1836 supported Hugh L. White for
the Presidency, and in the political altercations between John Bell and James K. Polk, which
distracted Tennessee at the time, supported the former. Mr. Johnson was the only ardent follower
of Bell that failed to go over to the Whig party. Was an elector for the State at large on
the Van Buren ticket in 1840, and made a State reputation by the force of his oratory. In 1841
was elected to the State senate from Greene and Hawkins counties, and while in that body was
one of the "immortal thirteen" Democrats who, having it in their power to prevent the election
of a Whig Senator, did so by refusing to meet the house in joint convention; also proposed
that the basis of representation should rest upon white votes, without regard to the ownership
of slaves. Was elected to Congress in 1843 over John A. Asken, a United States Bank Democrat,
who was supported by the Whigs. His first speech was in support of the resolution to restore
to General Jackson the fine imposed upon him at New Orleans; also supported the annexation
of Texas. In 1845 was reelected, and supported Polk's Administration. Was regularly reelected
to Congress until 1853. During this period opposed all expenditures for internal improvements
that were not general; resisted and defeated the proposed contingent tax of 10 per cent on
tea and coffee; made his celebrated defense of the veto power; urged the adoption of the homestead
law, which was obnoxious to the extreme Southern element of his party; supported the compromise
measures of 1850 as a matter of expediency, but opposed compromises in general as a sacrifice
of principle. Was elected governor of Tennessee in 1853 over Gustavus A. Henry, the "Eagle
Orator" of the State. In his message to the legislature he dwelt upon the homestead law and
other measures for the benefit of the working classes, and earned the title of the "Mechanic
Governor." Opposed the Know-nothing movement with characteristic vehemence. Was reelected governor
in 1855, defeating Meredith P. Gentry, the Whig-American candidate, after a most remarkable
canvass. The Kansas-Nebraska bill received his earnest support. In 1857 was elected to the
United States Senate, where he urged the passage of the homestead bill, and on May 20, 1858,
made his greatest speech on this subject. Opposed the grant of aid for the construction of
a Pacific railroad. Was prominent in debate, and frequently clashed with Southern supporters
of the Administration. His pronounced Unionism estranged him from the extremists on the Southern
side, while his acceptance of slavery as an institution guaranteed by the Constitution caused
him to hold aloof from the Republicans on the other. At the Democratic convention at Charleston,
S.C., in 1860 was a candidate for the Presidential nomination, but received only the vote of
Tennessee, and when the convention reassembled in Baltimore withdrew his name. In the canvass
that followed supported John C. Breckinridge. At the session of Congress beginning in December,
1860, took decided and unequivocal grounds in opposition to secession, and on December 13 introduced
a joint resolution proposing to amend the Constitution so as to elect the President and Vice-President
by district votes, Senators by a direct popular vote, and to limit the terms of Federal judges
to twelve years, the judges to be equally divided between slaveholding and non-slaveholding
States. In his speech on this resolution, December 18 and 19, declared his unyielding opposition
to secession and announced his intention to stand by and act under the Constitution. Retained
his seat in the Senate until appointed by President Lincoln military governor of Tennessee,
March 4, 1862. March 12 reached Nashville, and organized a provisional government for the State;
March 18 issued a proclamation in which he appealed to the people to return to their allegiance,
to uphold the law, and to accept "a full and complete amnesty for all past acts and declarations;"
April 5 removed the mayor and other officials of Nashville for refusing to take the oath of
allegiance to the United States, and appointed others; urged the holding of Union meetings
throughout the State, and frequently attended them in person; completed the railroad from Nashville
to the Tennessee River; raised twenty-five regiments for service in the State; December 8,
1862, issued a proclamation ordering Congressional elections, and on the 15th levied an assessment
upon the richer Southern sympathizers "in behalf of the many helpless widows, wives, and children
in the city of Nashville who have been reduced to poverty and wretchedness in consequence of
their husbands, sons, and fathers having been forced into the armies of this unholy and nefarious
rebellion." Was nominated for Vice-President of the United States at the national Republican
convention at Baltimore June 8, 1864, and was elected on November 8. In his letter of acceptance
of the nomination Mr. Johnson virtually disclaimed any departure from his principles as a Democrat,
but placed his acceptance upon the ground of "the higher duty of first preserving the Government."
On the night of the 14th of April, 1865, President Lincoln was shot by an assassin and died
the next morning. At 11 o'clock a.m. April 15 Mr. Johnson was sworn in as President, at his
rooms in the Kirkwood House, Washington, by Chief Justice Chase, in the presence of nearly
all the Cabinet officers and others. April 29, 1865, issued a proclamation for the removal
of trade restrictions in most of the insurrectionary States, which, being in contravention
of an act of Congress, was subsequently modified. May 9 issued an Executive order restoring
Virginia to the Union. May 22 proclaimed all ports, except four in Texas, opened to foreign
commerce on July 1, 1865. May 29 issued a general amnesty proclamation, after which the fundamental
and irreconcilable differences between President Johnson and the party that had elevated him
to power became more apparent. He exercised the veto power to a very great extent, but it was
generally nullified by the two-thirds votes of both Houses. From May 29 to July 13, 1865, proclaimed
provisional governors for North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina,
and Florida, whose duties were to reorganize the State governments. The State governments were
reorganized, but the Republicans claimed that the laws passed were so stringent in reference
to the negroes that it was a worse form of slavery than the old. The thirteenth amendment to
the Constitution became a law December 18, 1865, with Mr. Johnson's concurrence. The first
breach between the President and the party in power was the veto of the Freedmen's Bureau bill,
in February, 1866, which was designed to protect the negroes. March 27 vetoed the civil-rights
bill, but it was passed over his veto. In a message of June 22, 1866, opposed the joint resolution
proposing the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution. In June, 1866, the Republicans in Congress
brought forward their plan of reconstruction, called the "Congressional plan," in contradistinction
to that of the President. The chief features of the Congressional plan were to give the negroes
the right to vote, to protect them in this right, and to prevent Confederate leaders from voting.
January 5, 1867, vetoed the act giving negroes the right of suffrage in the District of Columbia,
but it was passed over his veto. An attempt was made to impeach the President, but it failed.
In January, 1867, a bill was passed to deprive the President of the power to proclaim general
amnesty, which he disregarded. Measures were adopted looking to the meeting of the Fortieth
and all subsequent Congresses immediately after the adjournment of the preceding. The President
was deprived of the command of the Army by a rider to the army appropriation bill, which provided
that his orders should only be given through the General, who was not to be removed without
the previous consent of the Senate. The bill admitting Nebraska, providing that no law should
ever be passed in that State denying the right of suffrage to any person because of his color
or race, was vetoed by the President, but passed over his veto. March 2, 1867, vetoed the act
to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States, but it was passed over his
veto. It embodied the Congressional plan of reconstruction, and divided the Southern States
into five military districts, each under an officer of the Army not under the rank of brigadier-general,
who was to exercise all the functions of government until the citizens had "formed a constitution
of government in conformity with the Constitution of the United States in all respects." On
the same day vetoed the tenure-of-office act, which was also passed over his veto. It provided
that civil officers should remain in office until the confirmation of their successors; that
the members of the Cabinet should be removed only with the consent of the Senate, and that
when Congress was not in session the President could suspend but not remove any official, and
in case the Senate at the next session should not ratify the suspension the suspended official
should be reinducted into his office. August 5, 1867, requested Edwin M. Stanton to resign
his office as Secretary of War. Mr. Stanton refused, was suspended, and General Grant was appointed
Secretary of War ad interim. When Congress met, the Senate refused to ratify the suspension.
General Grant then resigned, and Mr. Stanton resumed the duties of his office. The President
removed him and appointed Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant-General of the Army, Secretary of War ad
interim. The Senate declared this act illegal, and Mr. Stanton refused to comply, and notified
the Speaker of the House. On February 24, 1868, the House of Representatives resolved to impeach
the President, and on March 2 and 3 articles of impeachment were agreed upon by the House of
Representatives, and on the 4th were presented to the Senate. The trial began on March 30.
May 16 the test vote was had; thirty-five Senators voted for conviction and nineteen for acquittal.
A change of one vote would have carried conviction. A verdict of acquittal was entered, and
the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment adjourned sine die. After the expiration of his
term the ex-President returned to Tennessee. Was a candidate for the United States Senate,
but was defeated. In 1872 was an unsuccessful candidate for Congressman from the State at large.
In January, 1875, was elected to the United States Senate, and took his seat at the extra session
of that year. Shortly after the session began made a speech which was a skillful but bitter
attack upon President Grant. While visiting his daughter near Elizabethton, in Carter County,
Tenn., was stricken with paralysis July 30, 1875, and died the following day. He was buried
at Greeneville, Tenn.

INAUGURAL ADDRESS.

[From the Sunday Morning Chronicle, Washington, April 16, 1865, and The Sun, Baltimore, April
17, 1865.]

GENTLEMEN: I must be permitted to say that I have been almost overwhelmed by the announcement
of the sad event which has so recently occurred. I feel incompetent to perform duties so important
and responsible as those which have been so unexpectedly thrown upon me. As to an indication
of any policy which may be pursued by me in the administration of the Government, I have to
say that that must be left for development as the Administration progresses. The message or
declaration must be made by the acts as they transpire. The only assurance that I can now give
of the future is reference to the past. The course which I have taken in the past in connection
with this rebellion must be regarded as a guaranty of the future. My past public life, which
has been long and laborious, has been founded, as I in good conscience believe, upon a great
principle of right, which lies at the basis of all things. The best energies of my life have
been spent in endeavoring to establish and perpetuate the principles of free government, and
I believe that the Government in passing through its present perils will settle down upon principles
consonant with popular rights more permanent and enduring than heretofore. I must be permitted
to say, if I understand the feelings of my own heart, that I have long labored to ameliorate
and elevate the condition of the great mass of the American people. Toil and an honest advocacy
of the great principles of free government have been my lot. Duties have been mine; consequences
are God's. This has been the foundation of my political creed, and I feel that in the end the
Government will triumph and that these great principles will be permanently established.

In conclusion, gentlemen, let me say that I want your encouragement and countenance. I shall
ask and rely upon you and others in carrying the Government through its present perils. I feel
in making this request that it will be heartily responded to by you and all other patriots
and lovers of the rights and interests of a free people.

APRIL 15, 1865.

PROCLAMATIONS.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas, by my direction, the Acting Secretary of State, in a notice to the public of the 17th,
requested the various religious denominations to assemble on the 19th instant, on the occasion
of the obsequies of Abraham Lincoln, late President of the United States, and to observe the
same with appropriate ceremonies; but

Whereas our country has become one great house of mourning, where the head of the family has
been taken away, and believing that a special period should be assigned for again humbling
ourselves before Almighty God, in order that the bereavement may be sanctified to the nation:

Now, therefore, in order to mitigate that grief on earth which can only be assuaged by communion
with the Father in heaven, and in compliance with the wishes of Senators and Representatives
in Congress, communicated to me by resolutions adopted at the National Capitol, I, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, do hereby appoint Thursday, the 25th day of May next, to be
observed, wherever in the United States the flag of the country may be respected, as a day
of humiliation and mourning, and I recommend my fellow citizens then to assemble in their respective
places of worship, there to unite in solemn service to Almighty God in memory of the good man
who has been removed, so that all shall be occupied at the same time in contemplation of his
virtues and in sorrow for his sudden and violent end.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

Whereas it appears from evidence in the Bureau of Military Justice that the atrocious murder
of the late President, Abraham Lincoln, and the attempted assassination of the Hon. William
H. Seward, Secretary of State, were incited, concerted, and procured by and between Jefferson
Davis, late of Richmond, Va., and Jacob Thompson, Clement C. Clay, Beverley Tucker, George
N. Sanders, William C. Cleary, and other rebels and traitors against the Government of the
United States harbored in Canada:

Now, therefore, to the end that justice may be done, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United
States, do offer and promise for the arrest of said persons, or either of them, within the
limits of the United States, so that they can be brought to trial, the following rewards:

One hundred thousand dollars for the arrest of Jefferson Davis.

Twenty-five thousand dollars for the arrest of Clement C. Clay.

Twenty-five thousand dollars for the arrest of Jacob Thompson, late of Mississippi.

Twenty-five thousand dollars for the arrest of George N. Sanders.

Twenty-five thousand dollars for the arrest of Beverley Tucker.

Ten thousand dollars for the arrest of William C. Cleary, late clerk of Clement C. Clay.

The Provost-Marshal-General of the United States is directed to cause a description of said
persons, with notice of the above rewards, to be published.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

Whereas the President of the United States, by his proclamation of the 19th day of April, 1861,
did declare certain States therein mentioned in insurrection against the Government of the
United States; and

Whereas armed resistance to the authority of this Government in the said insurrectionary States
may be regarded as virtually at an end, and the persons by whom that resistance, as well as
the operations of insurgent cruisers, was directed are fugitives or captives; and

Whereas it is understood that some of those cruisers are still infesting the high seas and
others are preparing to capture, burn, and destroy vessels of the United States:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, hereby
enjoin all naval, military, and civil officers of the United States diligently to endeavor,
by all lawful means, to arrest the said cruisers and to bring them into a port of the United
States, in order that they may be prevented from committing further depredations on commerce
and that the persons on board of them may no longer enjoy impunity for their crimes.

And I do further proclaim and declare that if, after a reasonable time shall have elapsed for
this proclamation to become known in the ports of nations claiming to have been neutrals, the
said insurgent cruisers and the persons on board of them shall continue to receive hospitality
in the said ports, this Government will deem itself justified in refusing hospitality to the
public vessels of such nations in ports of the United States and in adopting such other measures
as may be deemed advisable toward vindicating the national sovereignty.

ANDREW JOHNSON. If, however, any vessel from a foreign port shall enter any of the before-named
excepted ports in the State of Texas, she will continue to be held liable to the penalties
prescribed by the act of Congress approved on the 13th day of July, 1861, and the persons on
board of her to such penalties as may be incurred, pursuant to the laws of war, for trading
or attempting to trade with an enemy.

And I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby declare and make known that
the United States of America do henceforth disallow to all persons trading or attempting to
trade in any ports of the United States in violation of the laws thereof all pretense of belligerent
rights and privileges; and I give notice that from the date of this proclamation all such offenders
will be held and dealt with as pirates.

It is also ordered that all restrictions upon trade heretofore imposed in the territory of
the United States east of the Mississippi River, save those relating to contraband of war,
to the reservation of the rights of the United States to property purchased in the territory
of an enemy, and to the 25 per cent upon purchases of cotton be removed. All provisions of
the internal-revenue law will be carried into effect under the proper officers.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

Whereas the President of the United States, on the 8th day of December, A.D. 1863, and on the
26th day of March, A.D. 1864, did, with the object to suppress the existing rebellion, to induce
all persons to return to their loyalty, and to restore the authority of the United States,
issue proclamations offering amnesty and pardon to certain persons who had, directly or by
implication, participated in the said rebellion; and

Whereas many persons who had so engaged in said rebellion have, since the issuance of said
proclamations, failed or neglected to take the benefits offered thereby; and

Whereas many persons who have been justly deprived of all claim to amnesty and pardon thereunder
by reason of their participation, directly or by implication, in said rebellion and continued
hostility to the Government of the United States since the date of said proclamations now desire
to apply for and obtain amnesty and pardon.

To the end, therefore, that the authority of the Government of the United States may be restored
and that peace, order, and freedom may be established, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the
United States, do proclaim and declare that I hereby grant to all persons who have, directly
or indirectly, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, amnesty
and pardon, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and except in cases
where legal proceedings under the laws of the United States providing for the confiscation
of property of persons engaged in rebellion have been instituted; but upon the condition, nevertheless,
that every such person shall take and subscribe the following oath (or affirmation) and thenceforward
keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation
and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to wit:

  I ---- ---- do solemnly swear (or affirm), in presence of Almighty
  God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend
  the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States
  thereunder, and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully
  support all laws and proclamations which have been made during the
  existing rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves.
  So help me God.

The following classes of persons are excepted from the benefits of this proclamation:

First. All who are or shall have been pretended civil or diplomatic officers or otherwise domestic
or foreign agents of the pretended Confederate government.

Second. All who left judicial stations under the United States to aid the rebellion.

Eighth. All military and naval officers in the rebel service who were educated by the Government
in the Military Academy at West Point or the United States Naval Academy.

States and passed beyond the Federal military lines into the pretended Confederate States for
the purpose of aiding the rebellion.

Eleventh. All persons who have been engaged in the destruction of the commerce of the United
States upon the high seas and all persons who have made raids into the United States from Canada
or been engaged in destroying the commerce of the United States upon the lakes and rivers that
separate the British Provinces from the United States.

Twelfth. All persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits hereof by taking
the oath herein prescribed, are in military, naval, or civil confinement or custody, or under
bonds of the civil, military, or naval authorities or agents of the United States as prisoners
of war, or persons detained for offenses of any kind, either before or after conviction.

Thirteenth. All persons who have voluntarily participated in said rebellion and the estimated
value of whose taxable property is over $20,000.

Fourteenth. All persons who have taken the oath of amnesty as prescribed in the President's
proclamation of December 8, A.D. 1863, or an oath of allegiance to the Government of the United
States since the date of said proclamation and who have not thenceforward kept and maintained
the same inviolate.

Provided, That special application may be made to the President for pardon by any person belonging
to the excepted classes, and such clemency will be liberally extended as may be consistent
with the facts of the case and the peace and dignity of the United States.

The Secretary of State will establish rules and regulations for administering and recording
the said amnesty oath, so as to insure its benefit to the people and guard the Government against
fraud.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas by the proclamations of the President of the 19th and 27th of April, 1861, a blockade
of certain ports of the United States was set on foot; but

Whereas the reasons for that measure have ceased to exist:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby
declare and proclaim the blockade aforesaid to be rescinded as to all the ports aforesaid,
including that of Galveston and other ports west of the Mississippi River, which ports will
be open to foreign commerce on the 1st of July next on the terms and conditions set forth in
my proclamation of the 22d of May last.

It is to be understood, however, that the blockade thus rescinded was an international measure
for the purpose of protecting the sovereign rights of the United States. The greater or less
subversion of civil authority in the region to which it applied and the impracticability of
at once restoring that in due efficiency may for a season make it advisable to employ the Army
and Navy of the United States toward carrying the laws into effect wherever such employment
may be necessary.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas it has been the desire of the General Government of the United States to restore unrestricted
commercial intercourse between and in the several States as soon as the same could be safely
done in view of resistance to the authority of the United States by combinations of armed insurgents;
and

Whereas that desire has been shown in my proclamations of the 29th of April, 1865, the 13th
of June, 1865, and the 23d of June, 1865; and

Whereas it now seems expedient and proper to remove restrictions upon internal, domestic, and
coastwise trade and commercial intercourse between and within the States and Territories west
of the Mississippi River:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby
declare that all restrictions upon internal, domestic, and coastwise intercourse and trade
and upon the purchase and removal of products of States and parts of States and Territories
heretofore declared in insurrection, lying west of the Mississippi River (excepting only those
relating to property heretofore purchased by the agents or captured by or surrendered to the
forces of the United States and to the transportation thereto or therein on private account
of arms, ammunition, all articles from which ammunition is made, gray uniforms, and gray cloth),
are annulled; and I do hereby direct that they be forthwith removed, and also that the commerce
of such States and parts of States shall be conducted under the supervision of the regularly
appointed officers of the customs, [who] shall receive any captured and abandoned property
that may be turned over to them under the law by the military or naval forces of the United
States and dispose of the same in accordance with instructions on the subject issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

And I do hereby direct--

First. That the military commander of the department and all officers and persons in the military
and naval service aid and assist the said provisional governor in carrying into effect this
proclamation; and they are enjoined to abstain from in any way hindering, impeding, or discouraging
the loyal people from the organization of a State government as herein authorized.

Second. That the Secretary of State proceed to put in force all laws of the United States the
administration whereof belongs to the State Department applicable to the geographical limits
aforesaid.

Fifth. That the district judge for the judicial district in which South Carolina is included
proceed to hold courts within said State in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress.
The Attorney-General will instruct the proper officers to libel and bring to judgment, confiscation,
and sale property subject to confiscation and enforce the administration of justice within
said State in all matters within the cognizance and jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

Sixth. That the Secretary of the Navy take possession of all public property belonging to the
Navy Department within said geographical limits and put in operation all acts of Congress in
relation to naval affairs having application to the said State.

Seventh. That the Secretary of the Interior put in force the laws relating to the Interior

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas by my proclamations of the 13th and 24th of June, 1865, removing restrictions, in part,
upon internal, domestic, and coastwise intercourse and trade with those States recently declared
in insurrection, certain articles were excepted from the effect of said proclamations as contraband
of war; and

Whereas the necessity for restricting trade in said articles has now in a great measure ceased:

It is hereby ordered that on and after the 1st day of September, 1865. all restrictions aforesaid
be removed, so that the articles declared by the said proclamations to be contraband of war
may be imported into and sold in said States, subject only to such regulations as the Secretary
of the Treasury may prescribe.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

Whereas it has pleased Almighty God during the year which is now coming to an end to relieve
our beloved country from the fearful scourge of civil war and to permit us to secure the blessings
of peace, unity, and harmony, with a great enlargement of civil liberty; and

Whereas our Heavenly Father has also during the year graciously averted from us the calamities
of foreign war, pestilence, and famine, while our granaries are full of the fruits of an abundant
season; and

Whereas righteousness exalteth a nation, while sin is a reproach to any people:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby
recommend to the people thereof that they do set apart and observe the first Thursday of December
next as a day of national thanksgiving to the Creator of the Universe for these great deliverances
and blessings.

And I do further recommend that on that occasion the whole people make confession of our national
sins against His infinite goodness, and with one heart and one mind implore the divine guidance
in the ways of national virtue and holiness.

Executive Order to Reestablish the Authority of the United States and Execute the Laws within
the Geographical Limits Known as the State of Virginia.

Ordered, first. That all acts and proceedings of the political, military, and civil organizations
which have been in a state of insurrection and rebellion within the State of Virginia against
the authority and laws of the United States, and of which Jefferson Davis, John Letcher, and
William Smith were late the respective chiefs, are declared null and void. All persons who
shall exercise, claim, pretend, or attempt to exercise any political, military, or civil power,
authority, jurisdiction, or right by, through, or under Jefferson Davis, late of the city of
Richmond, and his confederates, or under John Letcher or William Smith and their confederates,

Second. That the Secretary of State proceed to put in force all laws of the United States the

aforesaid.

Third. That the Secretary of the Treasury proceed without delay to nominate for appointment

the Treasury Department as are authorized by law, and shall put in execution the revenue laws
of the United States within the geographical limits aforesaid. In making appointments the preference
shall be given to qualified loyal persons residing within the districts where their respective
duties are to be performed; but if suitable persons shall not be found residents of the districts,
then persons residing in other States or districts shall be appointed.

Fourth. That the Postmaster-General shall proceed to establish post-offices and post routes
and put into execution the postal laws of the United States within the said State, giving to
loyal residents the preference of appointment; but if suitable persons are not found, then
to appoint agents, etc., from other States.

Fifth. That the district judge of said district proceed to hold courts within said State in
accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress. The Attorney-General will instruct the

in relation to naval affairs having application to the said State.

Eighth. The Secretary of the Interior will also put in force the laws relating to the Department

Ninth. That to carry into effect the guaranty by the Federal Constitution of a republican form
of State government and afford the advantage and security of domestic laws, as well as to complete

restoration of peace within the limits aforesaid, Francis H. Peirpoint, governor of the State

GENERAL ORDERS, No. 107.

WAR DEPARTMENT,
  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,
    Washington, June 2, 1865.

Ordered, That all military restrictions upon trade in any of the States or Territories of the
United States, except in articles contraband of war--to wit, arms, ammunition, gray cloth,
and all articles from which ammunition is manufactured; locomotives, cars, railroad iron, and
machinery for operating railroads; telegraph wires, insulators, and instruments for operating
telegraphic lines--shall cease from and after the present date.

By order of the President of the United States:

E.D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, June 2, 1865.

Whereas, pursuant to the order of the President and as a means required by the public safety,
directions were issued from this Department, under date of the 17th of December, 1864, requiring
passports from all travelers entering the United States, except immigrant passengers directly
entering an American port from a foreign country; and

Whereas the necessities which required the adoption of that measure are believed no longer
to exist:

Now, therefore, the President directs that from and after this date the order above referred
to shall be, and the same is hereby, rescinded.

Nothing in this regulation, however, will be construed to relieve from due accountability any
enemies of the United States or offenders against their peace and dignity who may hereafter
seek to enter the country or at any time be found within its lawful jurisdiction.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, D.C., June 2, 1865.

Whereas by an act of Congress approved March 3, 1865, there was established in the War Department
a Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, and to which, in accordance with the said
act of Congress, is committed the supervision and management of all abandoned lands and the
control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from rebel States, or from any district
of country within the territory embraced in the operations of the Army, under such rules and
regulations as may be prescribed by the head of the Bureau and approved by the President; and

Whereas it appears that the management of abandoned lands and subjects relating to refugees
and freedmen, as aforesaid, have been and still are, by orders based on military exigencies
or legislation based on previous statutes, partly in the hands of military officers disconnected
with said Bureau and partly in charge of officers of the Treasury Department: It is therefore

Ordered, That all officers of the Treasury Department, all military officers, and all others
in the service of the United States turn over to the authorized officers of said Bureau all
abandoned lands and property contemplated in said act of Congress approved March 3, 1865, establishing
the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, that may now be under or within their
control. They will also turn over to such officers all funds collected by tax or otherwise
for the benefit of refugees or freedmen or accruing from abandoned lands or property set apart
for their use, and will transfer to them all official records connected with the administration
of affairs which pertain to said Bureau.

GENERAL ORDERS, No. 109.

WAR DEPARTMENT,
  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,
    Washington, June 6, 1865.

ORDER FOR THE DISCHARGE OF CERTAIN PRISONERS OF WAR.

The prisoners of war at the several depots in the North will be discharged under the following
regulations and restrictions:

I. All enlisted men of the rebel army and petty officers and seamen of the rebel navy will
be discharged upon taking the oath of allegiance.

II. Officers of the rebel army not above the grade of captain and of the rebel navy not above
the grade of lieutenant, except such as have graduated at the United States Military or Naval
academies and such as held a commission in either the United States Army or Navy at the beginning
of the rebellion, may be discharged upon taking the oath of allegiance.

III. When the discharges hereby ordered are completed, regulations will be issued in respect
to the discharge of officers having higher rank than captain in the army or lieutenant in the navy.

IV. The several commanders of prison stations will discharge each day as many of the prisoners
hereby authorized to be discharged as proper rolls can be prepared for, beginning with those
who have been longest in prison and from the most remote points of the country; and certified
rolls will be forwarded daily to the Commissary-General of Prisoners of those so discharged.
The oath of allegiance only will be administered, but notice will be given that all who desire
will be permitted to take the oath of amnesty after their release, in accordance with the regulations
of the Department of State respecting the amnesty.

V. The Quartermaster's Department will furnish transportation to all released prisoners to
the nearest accessible point to their homes, by rail or by steamboat.

Whereas circumstances of recent occurrence have made it no longer necessary to continue the
prohibition of the departure for her destination of the gunboat Fusyama, built at New York
for the Japanese Government, it is consequently ordered that that prohibition be removed. The
Secretary of the Treasury will therefore cause a clearance to be issued to the Fusyama, and
the Secretary of the Navy will not allow any obstacle thereto.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Washington, D.C., June 9, 1865.

It is represented to me in a communication from the Secretary of the Interior that Indians
in New Mexico have been seized and reduced into slavery, and it is recommended that the authority
of the executive branch of the Government should be exercised for the effectual suppression
of a practice which is alike in violation of the rights of the Indians and of the provisions
of the organic law of the said Territory.

Concurring in this recommendation, I do hereby order that the heads of the several Executive
Departments do enjoin upon the subordinates, agents, and employees under their respective orders
or supervision in that Territory to discountenance the practice aforesaid and to take all lawful
means to suppress the same.

WASHINGTON, August 7, 1865.

An impression seems to prevail that the interests of persons having business with the executive
government require that they should have personal interviews with the President or heads of
Departments. As this impression is believed to be entirely unfounded, it is expected that applications
relating to such business will hereafter be made in writing to the head of that Department
to which the business may have been assigned by law. Those applications will in their order
be considered and disposed of by heads of Departments, subject to the approval of the President.
This order is made necessary by the unusual numbers of persons visiting the seat of Government.
It is impracticable to grant personal interviews to all of them, and desirable that there should
be no invidious distinction in this respect. Similar business of persons who can not conveniently
leave their homes must be neglected if the time of the executive officers here is engrossed
by personal interviews with others.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

[From the Daily National Intelligencer, August 26, 1865.]

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, August 25, 1865.

Paroled prisoners asking passports as citizens of the United States, and against whom no special
charges may be pending, will be furnished with passports upon application therefor to the Department
of State in the usual form. Such passports will, however, be issued upon the condition that
the applicants do not return to the United States without leave of the President. Other persons
implicated in the rebellion who may wish to go abroad will apply to the Department of State
for passports, and the applications will be disposed of according to the merits of the several
cases.

By the President of the United States:

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE, September 7, 1865.

It is hereby ordered, That so much of the Executive order bearing date the 7th [2d] day of
June, 1865, as made it the duty of all officers of the Treasury Department, military officers,
and all others in the service of the United States to turn over to the authorized officers
of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands all funds collected by tax or otherwise
for the benefit of refugees or freedmen, or accruing from abandoned lands or property set apart
for their use, be, and the same is hereby, suspended.

refugees and freedmen may be transported at Government expense, when such stores and books
shall be turned over to the officers of the Quartermaster's Department, with the approval of

SPECIAL ORDERS, NO. 503.

WAR DEPARTMENT,
  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,
    Washington, September 19, 1865.

       *       *       *       *       *

It has been represented to the Department that commanders of military posts and districts in
Georgia, and particularly Brevet Brigadier-General C.H. Grosvenor, provost-marshal-general,
and Brevet Major-General King, commanding in the district of Augusta, have assumed to decide
questions of contracts and conflicting claims of property between individuals, and to order
the delivery, surrender, or transfer of property and documents of title as between private
persons, in which the Government is not concerned.

All such acts and proceedings on the part of military authorities in said State are declared
by the President to be without authority and null and void.

All military commanders and authorities within said State are strictly ordered to abstain from
any such acts, and not in any way to interfere with or assume to adjudicate any right, title,
or claim of property between private individuals, and to suspend all action upon any orders
heretofore made in respect to the ownership or delivery of property and the validity of contracts
between private persons.

They are also forbidden from being directly or indirectly interested in any sales or contracts
for cotton or other products of said State, and from using or suffering to be used any Government
transportation for the transporting of cotton or other products of said State for or in behalf
of private persons on any pretense whatever.

Military officers have no authority to interfere in any way in questions of sale or contracts
of any kind between individuals or to decide any question of property between them without
special instructions from this Department authorizing their action, and the usurpation of such
power will be treated as a grave military offense.

Major-General Steedman, commanding the Department of Georgia, is specially charged with the
enforcement of this order, and directed to make report as to any acts, proceedings, or orders
of Brevet Major-General King and Brevet Brigadier-General Grosvenor, provost-marshal-general,
in regard to contracts or conflicting claims of individuals in relation to cotton or other
products, and to suspend all action upon any such orders until further instructions.

By order of the President of the United States.

WAR DEPARTMENT,
  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,
    Washington, October 9, 1865.

Whereas certain tracts of land, situated on the coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida,
at the time for the most part vacant, were set apart by Major-General W. T. Sherman's special
field order No. 15 for the benefit of refugees and freedmen that had been congregated by the
operations of war or had been left to take care of themselves by their former owners; and

Whereas an expectation was thereby created that they would be able to retain possession of
said lands; and

Whereas a large number of the former owners are earnestly soliciting the restoration of the
same and promising to absorb the labor and care for the freedmen:

It is ordered, That Major-General Howard, Commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen,
and Abandoned Lands, proceed to the several above-named States and endeavor to effect an arrangement
mutually satisfactory to the freedmen and the landowners, and make report. And in case a mutually
satisfactory arrangement can be effected, he is duly empowered and directed to issue such orders
as may become necessary, after a full and careful investigation of the interests of the parties
concerned.

By order of the President of the United States:

E.D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Clark, of Mississippi, lately engaged in rebellion against the United States Government, who
are now in close custody, have made their submission to the authority of the United States
and applied to the President for pardon under his proclamation; and

Whereas the authority of the Federal Government is sufficiently restored in the aforesaid States
to admit of the enlargement of said persons from close custody:

It is ordered, That they be released on giving their respective paroles to appear at such time
and place as the President may designate to answer any charge that he may direct to be preferred
against them, and also that they will respectively abide until further orders in the places
herein designated, and not depart therefrom, to wit:

John A. Campbell, in the State of Alabama; John H. Reagan, in the State of Texas; Alexander
H. Stephens, in the State of Georgia; George A. Trenholm, in the State of South Carolina; and

In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 11th instant, requesting
information relative to a so-called decree concerning the reestablishment of slavery or peonage
in the Republic of Mexico, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents
by which it was accompanied.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., December 18, 1865.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:

In compliance with the requirements of the third section of the act approved March 3, 1865,
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of War, with the accompanying report
and estimates of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 18, 1865.

To the Senate of the United States:

In reply to the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 12th instant, I have the honor to state
that the rebellion waged by a portion of the people against the properly constituted authority
of the Government of the United States has been suppressed; that the United States are in possession
of every State in which the insurrection existed, and that, as far as it could be done, the
courts of the United States have been restored, post-offices reestablished, and steps taken
to put into effective operation the revenue laws of the country.

As the result of the measures instituted by the Executive with the view of inducing a resumption
of the functions of the States comprehended in the inquiry of the Senate, the people of North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee
have reorganized their respective State governments, and "are yielding obedience to the laws
and Government of the United States" with more willingness and greater promptitude than under
the circumstances could reasonably have been anticipated. The proposed amendment to the Constitution,
providing for the abolition of slavery forever within the limits of the country, has been ratified
by each one of those States, with the exception of Mississippi, from which no official information
has been received, and in nearly all of them measures have been adopted or are now pending
to confer upon freedmen the privileges which are essential to their comfort, protection, and
security. In Florida and Texas the people are making commendable progress in restoring their
State governments, and no doubt is entertained that they will at an early period be in a condition
to resume all of their practical relations with the General Government.

In "that portion of the Union lately in rebellion" the aspect of affairs is more promising
than, in view of all the circumstances, could well have been expected. The people throughout
the entire South evince a laudable desire to renew their allegiance to the Government and to
repair the devastations of war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful pursuits, and abiding
faith is entertained that their actions will conform to their professions, and that in acknowledging
the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States their loyalty will be unreservedly
given to the Government, whose leniency they can not fail to appreciate and whose fostering
care will soon restore them to a condition of prosperity. It is true that in some of the States
the demoralizing effects of the war are to be seen in occasional disorders; but these are local
in character, not frequent in occurrence, and are rapidly disappearing as the authority of
civil law is extended and sustained. Perplexing questions are naturally to be expected from
the great and sudden change in the relations between the two races; but systems are gradually
developing themselves under which the freedman will receive the protection to which he is justly
entitled, and, by means of his labor, make himself a useful and independent member in the community
in which he has a home.

From all the information in my possession and from that which I have recently derived from
the most reliable authority I am induced to cherish the belief that sectional animosity is
surely and rapidly merging itself into a spirit of nationality, and that representation, connected
with a properly adjusted system of taxation, will result in a harmonious restoration of the
relation of the States to the National Union.

The report of Carl Schurz is herewith transmitted, as requested by the Senate. No reports from
the Hon. John Covode have been received by the President. The attention of the Senate is invited
to the accompanying report from Lieutenant-General Grant, who recently made a tour of inspection
through several of the States whose inhabitants participated in the rebellion.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 20, 1865.

To the Senate of the United States:

In reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant, requesting that the President,
if not inconsistent with the public service, communicate to the Senate the "report of General
Howard of his observations of the condition of the seceded States and the operation of the
Freedmen's Bureau therein," I have to state that the report of the Commissioner of the Bureau
of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands was yesterday transmitted to both Houses of Congress,
as required by the third section of the act approved March 3, 1865.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 21, 1865.

To the Senate:

In compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant, respecting the occupation
by the French troops of the Republic of Mexico and the establishment of a monarchy there, I

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 5, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

In compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th ultimo, requesting information
in regard to any plans to induce the immigration of dissatisfied citizens of the United States
into Mexico, their organization there with the view to create disturbances in the United States,
and especially in regard to the plans of Dr. William M. Gwin and M.F. Maury, and to the action
taken by the Government of the United States to prevent the success of such schemes, I transmit
a report from the Acting Secretary of State and the papers by which it was accompanied.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 5, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have received the following preamble and resolution, adopted by the Senate on the 21st ultimo:

  Whereas the Constitution declares that "in all criminal prosecutions
  the accused shall enjoy the right of a speedy and public trial by an
  impartial jury of the State or district wherein the crime shall have
  been committed;" and

  Whereas several months have elapsed since Jefferson Davis, late
  president of the so-called Confederate States, was captured and confined
  for acts notoriously done by him as such, which acts, if duly proved,
  render him guilty of treason against the United States and liable to the
  penalties thereof; and

  Whereas hostilities between the Government of the United States and the
  insurgents have ceased, and not one of the latter, so far as is known to
  the Senate, is now held in confinement for the part he may have acted in
  the rebellion except said Jefferson Davis: Therefore,

  Resolved, That the President be respectfully requested, if compatible
  with the public safety, to inform the Senate upon what charges or for
  what reasons said Jefferson Davis is still held in confinement, and why
  he has not been put upon his trial.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 5, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

In compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 18th ultimo, requesting
information in regard to steps taken by the so-called Emperor of Mexico or by any European
power to obtain from the United States a recognition of the so-called Empire of Mexico, and
what action has been taken in the premises by the Government of the United States, I transmit
a report from the Acting Secretary of State and the papers by which it was accompanied.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 10, 1866.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., January 12, 1866.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I transmit herewith a communication addressed to me by Messrs. John Evans and J.B. Chaífee
as "United States Senators elect from the State of Colorado," together with the accompanying
documents.

Under authority of the act of Congress approved the 21st day of March, 1864, the people of
Colorado, through a convention, formed a constitution making provision for a State government,
which, when submitted to the qualified voters of the Territory, was rejected.

In the summer of 1865 a second convention was called by the executive committees of the several
political parties in the Territory, which assembled at Denver on the 8th of August, 1865. On
the 12th of that month this convention adopted a State constitution, which was submitted to
the people on the 5th of September, 1865, and ratified by a majority of 155 of the qualified
voters. The proceedings in the second instance for the formation of a State government having
differed in time and mode from those specified in the act of March 21, 1864, I have declined
to issue the proclamation for which provision is made in the fifth section of the law, and
therefore submit the question for the consideration and further action of Congress.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

To the Senate of the United States:

In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 17th instant, requesting the President "to
communicate to the Senate, if in his opinion not inconsistent with the public interest, any
letters from Major-General Sheridan, commanding the Military Division of the Gulf, or from
any other officer of the Department of Texas, in regard to the present condition of affairs
on the southeastern frontier of the United States, and especially in regard to any violation
of neutrality on the part of the army now occupying the right bank of the Rio Grande," I transmit
herewith a report from the Secretary of War, bearing date the 24th instant.

Concurring in his opinion that the publication of the correspondence at this time is not consistent

withheld.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 26, 1866.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 30, 1866.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

Believing that the commercial interests of our country would be promoted by a formal recognition
of the independence of the Dominican Republic, while such a recognition would be in entire
conformity with the settled policy of the United States, I have with that view nominated to
the Senate an officer of the same grade with the one now accredited to the Republic of Hayti;
and I recommend that an appropriation be made by Congress toward providing for his compensation.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, February 1, 1866.

not incompatible with the public interests, to communicate to the Senate a copy of the late
report of Major-General Sherman upon the condition of the States in his department, in which
he has lately made a tour of inspection," I transmit herewith a copy of a communication, dated
December 22, 1865, addressed to the Headquarters of the Army by Major-General Sherman, commanding
the Military Division of the Mississippi.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, February 9, 1866.

In reply to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 10th ultimo, requesting the

of the Government as to the grounds, facts, or accusations upon which Jefferson Davis, Clement
C. Clay, jr., Stephen R. Mallory, and David L. Yulee, or either of them, are held in confinement,"
I transmit herewith reports from the Secretary of War and the Attorney-General, and concur
in the opinion therein expressed that the publication of the papers called for by the resolution
is not at the present time compatible with the public interest.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, February 10, 1866.

may be allowed to assume and pay in State bonds the direct tax now due from that State to the

its bonds or by taxation make provision for the liquidation of the indebtedness.

I concur in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury "that it is desirable that the State
of Alabama and the other Southern States should be allowed to assume and pay their proportion
of the direct taxes now due," and therefore recommend the necessary legislation by Congress.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I herewith transmit communications from the Secretary of the Treasury and the Postmaster-General,
suggesting a modification of the oath of office prescribed by the act of Congress approved
July 2, 1862. I fully concur in their recommendation, and as the subject pertains to the efficient

to the early consideration of Congress.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, April 6, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit, for the constitutional action of the Senate, a supplemental article to the Pottawatomie

in reference to grants of land made by acts of Congress passed in the years 1850, 1853, and
1856 to the States of Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, and Louisiana, to aid in the
construction of certain railroads. As these acts will expire by limitation on the 11th day
of August, 1866, leaving the roads for whose benefit they were conferred in an unfinished condition,
it is recommended that the time within which they may be completed be extended for a period
of five years.

respecting General Orders, No. 17,[6] issued by the commander of the Department of California,

to the parties engaged in the existing war in Mexico, and to suffer no armed parties to pass

To the House of Representatives:

a report from the Secretary of State and the documents by which it was accompanied.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, D.C., April 24, 1866.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I submit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, the accompanying communication from the
Secretary of the Interior, in relation to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, eastern division.

It appears that the company were required to complete 100 miles of their road within three
years after their acceptance of the conditions of the original act of Congress. This period
expired December 22, 1865. Sixty-two miles had been previously accepted by the Government.
Since that date an additional section of 23 miles has been completed. Commissioners appointed
for that purpose have examined and reported upon it, and an application has been made for its
acceptance.

The failure to complete 100 miles of road within the period prescribed renders it questionable
whether the executive officers of the Government are authorized to issue the bonds and patents
to which the company would be entitled if this as well as the other requirements of the act
had been faithfully observed.

This failure may to some extent be ascribed to the financial condition of the country incident
to the recent civil war. As the company appear to be engaged in the energetic prosecution of
their work and manifest a disposition to comply with the conditions of the grant, I recommend
that the time for the completion of this part of the road be extended and that authority be
given for the issue of bonds and patents on account of the section now offered for acceptance
notwithstanding such failure, should the company in other respects be thereunto entitled.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 28, 1866.

information in regard to the rebel debt known as the cotton loan, I transmit a report from
the Secretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., May 2, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

In reply to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 23d ultimo, I transmit a
report from the Secretary of War, from which it will be perceived that it is not deemed compatible
with the public interests to communicate to the House the report made by General Smith and
the Hon. James T. Brady of their investigations at New Orleans, La.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., May 4, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th of March, 1866, requesting
the names of persons worth more than $20,000 to whom special pardons have been issued, and
a statement of the amount of property which has been seized as belonging to the enemies of
the Government, or as abandoned property, and returned to those who claimed to be the original
owners, I transmit herewith reports from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Secretary of War, and the Attorney-General, together with a copy of the amnesty proclamation
of the 29th of May, 1865, and a copy of the warrants issued in cases in which special pardons
are granted. The second, third, and fourth conditions of the warrant prescribe the terms, so
far as property is concerned, upon which all such pardons are granted and accepted.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, May 4, 1866.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

Referring to my message of the 12th of March last, communicating information in regard to a
proposed exposition of fishery and water culture at Arcachon, in France, I communicate a copy
of another dispatch from the minister of the United States in Paris to the Secretary of State,
and again invite the attention of Congress to the subject.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, May 7, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

In compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th ultimo, I transmit herewith a report
from Benjamin C. Truman, relative to the condition of the Southern people and the States in
which the rebellion existed.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, May 9, 1866.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I transmit to Congress a copy of a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the acting
chargé d'affaires of the United States at Guayaquil, in the Republic of Ecuador, from which
it appears that the Government of that Republic has failed to pay the first installment of
the award of the commissioners under the convention between the United States and Ecuador of
the 25th November, 1862, which installment was due on the 17th of February last.

As debts of this character from one government to another are justly regarded as of a peculiarly
sacred character, and as further diplomatic measures are not in this instance likely to be
successful, the expediency of authorizing other proceedings in case they should ultimately
prove to be indispensable is submitted to your consideration.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., May 10, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, in answer to the resolution
of the House of Representatives of the 3d instant, requesting information concerning discriminations

commerce from particular American ports.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

With sincere regret I announce to Congress that Winfield Scott, late Lieutenant-General in

To the House of Representatives:

In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 11th instant, requesting
information concerning the provisions of the laws and ordinances of the late insurgent States

and the document by which it was accompanied.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

To the House of Representatives:

In answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 28th of May, requesting information
as to what progress has been made in completing the maps connected with the boundary survey

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., June 20, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

In compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 21st ultimo, requesting
information as to the collection of the direct tax in the States whose inhabitants participated
in the rebellion, I transmit a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury, accompanied
by a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., June 22, 1866.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I submit to Congress a report of the Secretary of State, to whom was referred the concurrent
resolution of the 18th instant, respecting a submission to the legislatures of the States of
an additional article to the Constitution of the United States. It will be seen from this report
that the Secretary of State had, on the 16th instant, transmitted to the governors of the several
States certified copies of the joint resolution passed on the 13th instant, proposing an amendment
to the Constitution.

Even in ordinary times any question of amending the Constitution must be justly regarded as
of paramount importance. This importance is at the present time enhanced by the fact that the
joint resolution was not submitted by the two Houses for the approval of the President and
that of the thirty-six States which constitute the Union eleven are excluded from representation
in either House of Congress, although, with the single exception of Texas, they have been entirely
restored to all their functions as States in conformity with the organic law of the land, and
have appeared at the national capital by Senators and Representatives, who have applied for
and have been refused admission to the vacant seats. Nor have the sovereign people of the nation
been afforded an opportunity of expressing their views upon the important questions which the
amendment involves. Grave doubts, therefore, may naturally and justly arise as to whether the
action of Congress is in harmony with the sentiments of the people, and whether State legislatures,
elected without reference to such an issue, should be called upon by Congress to decide respecting
the ratification of the proposed amendment.

Waiving the question as to the constitutional validity of the proceedings of Congress upon
the joint resolution proposing the amendment or as to the merits of the article which it submits
through the executive department to the legislatures of the States, I deem it proper to observe
that the steps taken by the Secretary of State, as detailed in the accompanying report, are
to be considered as purely ministerial, and in no sense whatever committing the Executive to
an approval or a recommendation of the amendment to the State legislatures or to the people.
On the contrary, a proper appreciation of the letter and spirit of the Constitution, as well
as of the interests of national order, harmony, and union, and a due deference for an enlightened
public judgment may at this time well suggest a doubt whether any amendment to the Constitution
ought to be proposed by Congress and pressed upon the legislatures of the several States for
final decision until after the admission of such loyal Senators and Representatives of the
now unrepresented States as have been or as may hereafter be chosen in conformity with the
Constitution and laws of the United States.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, June 22, 1866.

of the United States at Paris.

as to whether any of the civil or military employees of the Government have assisted in the
rendition of public honors to the rebel living or dead.

at the Delaware Agency, Kans., on the 4th instant between the United States and the Delaware
Indians.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 20, 1866.

To the Senate:

I herewith submit, for the constitutional action of the Senate, a treaty negotiated at the
city of Washington, D.C., on the 19th instant, between the United States, represented by Dennis
N. Cooley, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and Elijah Sells, superintendent of Indian affairs
for the southern superintendency, and the Cherokee Nation of Indians; represented by its delegates,
James McDaniel, Smith Christie, White Catcher, L.H. Benge, J.B. Jones, and Daniel H. Ross.

The distracted condition of the Cherokee Nation and the peculiar relation of many of its members
to this Government during the rebellion presented almost insuperable difficulties to treating
with them. The treaty now submitted is a result of protracted negotiations. Its stipulations
are, it is believed, as satisfactory to the contracting parties and furnish as just provisions
for the welfare of the Indians and as strong guaranties for the maintenance of peaceful relations
with them as under the circumstances could be expected.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 24, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

I hereby transmit, for the constitutional action of the Senate, a treaty concluded on the 15th
of November, 1865, between the United States and the confederate tribes and bands of Indians
of middle Oregon, the same being amendatory and supplemental to the treaty with said Indians
of the 25th of June, 1855.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 24, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

The following "Joint resolution, restoring Tennessee to her relations in the Union," was last
evening presented for my approval:

Whereas in the year 1861 the government of the State of Tennessee was seized upon and taken
possession of by persons in hostility to the United States, and the inhabitants of said State,
in pursuance of an act of Congress, were declared to be in a state of insurrection against
the United States; and

Whereas said State government can only be restored to its former political relations in the
Union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the United States; and

Whereas the people of said State did, on the 22d day of February, 1865, by a large popular
vote, adopt and ratify a constitution of government whereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances
and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared void; and

Whereas a State government has been organized under said constitution which has ratified the
amendment to the Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery, also the amendment proposed
by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and has done other acts proclaiming and denoting loyalty: Therefore,

Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress
assembled, That the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical relations
to the Union, and is again entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives in Congress.

The preamble simply consists of statements, some of which are assumed, while the resolution
is merely a declaration of opinion. It comprises no legislation, nor does it confer any power
which is binding upon the respective Houses, the Executive, or the States. It does not admit
to their seats in Congress the Senators and Representatives from the State of Tennessee, for,
notwithstanding the passage of the resolution, each House, in the exercise of the constitutional
right to judge for itself of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members, may,
at its discretion, admit them or continue to exclude them. If a joint resolution of this kind
were necessary and binding as a condition precedent to the admission of members of Congress,
it would happen, in the event of a veto by the Executive, that Senators and Representatives
could only be admitted to the halls of legislation by a two-thirds vote of each of the Houses.

Among other reasons recited in the preamble for the declaration contained in the resolution
is the ratification by the State government of Tennessee of "the amendment to the Constitution
of the United States abolishing slavery, also the amendment proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress."
If, as is also declared in the preamble, "said State government can only be restored to its
former political relations in the Union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the United
States," it would really seem to follow that the joint resolution which at this late day has
received the sanction of Congress should have been passed, approved, and placed on the statute
books before any amendment to the Constitution was submitted to the legislature of Tennessee
for ratification. Otherwise the inference is plainly deducible that while, in the opinion of
Congress, the people of a State may be too strongly disloyal to be entitled to representation,
they may nevertheless, during the suspension of their "former proper practical relations to
the Union," have an equally potent voice with other and loyal States in propositions to amend
the Constitution, upon which so essentially depend the stability, prosperity, and very existence
of the nation.

A brief reference to my annual message of the 4th of December last will show the steps taken
by the Executive for the restoration to their constitutional relations to the Union of the
States that had been affected by the rebellion. The amendment to the Constitution abolishing
slavery forever within the limits of the country was also submitted to the States, and they
were thus invited to and did participate in its ratification, thus exercising the highest functions
pertaining to a State. In addition nearly all of these States, through their conventions and
legislatures, had adopted and ratified constitutions "of government whereby slavery was abolished
and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared
void." So far, then, the political existence of the States and their relations to the Federal
Government had been fully and completely recognized and acknowledged by the executive department
of the Government; and the completion of the work of restoration, which had progressed so favorably,
was submitted to Congress, upon which devolved all questions pertaining to the admission to
their seats of the Senators and Representatives chosen from the States whose people had engaged
in the rebellion.

All these steps had been taken when, on the 4th day of December, 1865, the Thirty-ninth Congress
assembled. Nearly eight months have elapsed since that time; and no other plan of restoration
having been proposed by Congress for the measures instituted by the Executive, it is now declared,
in the joint resolution submitted for my approval, "that the State of Tennessee is hereby restored
to her former proper practical relations to the Union, and is again entitled to be represented
by Senators and Representatives in Congress." Thus, after the lapse of nearly eight months,
Congress proposes to pave the way to the admission to representation of one of the eleven States
whose people arrayed themselves in rebellion against the constitutional authority of the Federal
Government.

Earnestly desiring to remove every cause of further delay, whether real or imaginary, on the
part of Congress to the admission to seats of loyal Senators and Representatives from the State
of Tennessee, I have, notwithstanding the anomalous character of this proceeding, affixed my
signature to the resolution. My approval, however, is not to be construed as an acknowledgment
of the right of Congress to pass laws preliminary to the admission of duly qualified Representatives
from any of the States. Neither is it to be considered as committing me to all the statements
made in the preamble, some of which are, in my opinion, without foundation in fact, especially
the assertion that the State of Tennessee has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of
the United States proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress. No official notice of such ratification
has been received by the Executive or filed in the Department of State; on the contrary, unofficial
information from the most reliable sources induces the belief that the amendment has not yet
been constitutionally sanctioned by the legislature of Tennessee. The right of each House under
the Constitution to judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members
is undoubted, and my approval or disapproval of the resolution could not in the slightest degree
increase or diminish the authority in this respect conferred upon the two branches of Congress.

In conclusion I can not too earnestly repeat my recommendation for the admission of Tennessee,
and all other States, to a fair and equal participation in national legislation when they present
themselves in the persons of loyal Senators and Representatives who can comply with all the
requirements of the Constitution and the laws. By this means harmony and reconciliation will
be effected, the practical relations of all the States to the Federal Government reestablished,
and the work of restoration, inaugurated upon the termination of the war, successfully completed.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

  Fenians to be discontinued, if compatible with the public interest--

I transmit a report on the subject from the Secretary of State, together with the documents
which accompany it.

VETO MESSAGES.

WASHINGTON, February 19, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have examined with care the bill, which originated in the Senate and has been passed by the
two Houses of Congress, to amend an act entitled "An act to establish a bureau for the relief
of freedmen and refugees," and for other purposes. Having with much regret come to the conclusion
that it would not be consistent with the public welfare to give my approval to the measure,
I return the bill to the Senate with my objections to its becoming a law.

I might call to mind in advance of these objections that there is no immediate necessity for
the proposed measure. The act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees,
which was approved in the month of March last, has not yet expired. It was thought stringent
and extensive enough for the purpose in view in time of war. Before it ceases to have effect
further experience may assist to guide us to a wise conclusion as to the policy to be adopted
in time of peace.

I share with Congress the strongest desire to secure to the freedmen the full enjoyment of
their freedom and property and their entire independence and equality in making contracts for
their labor, but the bill before me contains provisions which in my opinion are not warranted
by the Constitution and are not well suited to accomplish the end in view.

The bill proposes to establish by authority of Congress military jurisdiction over all parts
of the United States containing refugees and freedmen. It would by its very nature apply with
most force to those parts of the United States in which the freedmen most abound, and it expressly
extends the existing temporary jurisdiction of the Freedmen's Bureau, with greatly enlarged
powers, over those States "in which the ordinary course of judicial proceedings has been interrupted
by the rebellion." The source from which this military jurisdiction is to emanate is none other
than the President of the United States, acting through the War Department and the Commissioner
of the Freedmen's Bureau. The agents to carry out this military jurisdiction are to be selected
either from the Army or from civil life; the country is to be divided into districts and subdistricts,
and the number of salaried agents to be employed may be equal to the number of counties or
parishes in all the United States where freedmen and refugees are to be found.

The subjects over which this military jurisdiction is to extend in every part of the United
States include protection to "all employees, agents, and officers of this bureau in the exercise
of the duties imposed" upon them by the bill. In eleven States it is further to extend over
all cases affecting freedmen and refugees discriminated against "by local law, custom, or prejudice."
In those eleven States the bill subjects any white person who may be charged with depriving
a freedman of "any civil rights or immunities belonging to white persons" to imprisonment or
fine, or both, without, however, defining the "civil rights and immunities" which are thus
to be secured to the freedmen by military law. This military jurisdiction also extends to all
questions that may arise respecting contracts. The agent who is thus to exercise the office
of a military judge may be a stranger, entirely ignorant of the laws of the place, and exposed
to the errors of judgment to which all men are liable. The exercise of power over which there
is no legal supervision by so vast a number of agents as is contemplated by the bill must,
by the very nature of man, be attended by acts of caprice, injustice, and passion.

The trials having their origin under this bill are to take place without the intervention of
a jury and without any fixed rules of law or evidence. The rules on which offenses are to be
"heard and determined" by the numerous agents are such rules and regulations as the President,
through the War Department, shall prescribe. No previous presentment is required nor any indictment
charging the commission of a crime against the laws; but the trial must proceed on charges
and specifications. The punishment will be, not what the law declares, but such as a court-martial
may think proper; and from these arbitrary tribunals there lies no appeal, no writ of error
to any of the courts in which the Constitution of the United States vests exclusively the judicial
power of the country.

While the territory and the classes of actions and offenses that are made subject to this measure
are so extensive, the bill itself, should it become a law, will have no limitation in point
of time, but will form a part of the permanent legislation of the country. I can not reconcile
a system of military jurisdiction of this kind with the words of the Constitution which declare
that "no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on
a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces,
or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger," and that "in all
criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an
impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed." The
safeguards which the experience and wisdom of ages taught our fathers to establish as securities
for the protection of the innocent, the punishment of the guilty, and the equal administration
of justice are to be set aside, and for the sake of a more vigorous interposition in behalf
of justice we are to take the risks of the many acts of injustice that would necessarily follow
from an almost countless number of agents established in every parish or county in nearly a
third of the States of the Union, over whose decisions there is to be no supervision or control
by the Federal courts. The power that would be thus placed in the hands of the President is
such as in time of peace certainly ought never to be intrusted to any one man.

If it be asked whether the creation of such a tribunal within a State is warranted as a measure
of war, the question immediately presents itself whether we are still engaged in war. Let us
not unnecessarily disturb the commerce and credit and industry of the country by declaring
to the American people and to the world that the United States are still in a condition of
civil war. At present there is no part of our country in which the authority of the United
States is disputed. Offenses that may be committed by individuals should not work a forfeiture
of the rights of whole communities. The country has returned, or is returning, to a state of
peace and industry, and the rebellion is in fact at an end. The measure, therefore, seems to
be as inconsistent with the actual condition of the country as it is at variance with the Constitution
of the United States.

If, passing from general considerations, we examine the bill in detail, it is open to weighty
objections.

In time of war it was eminently proper that we should provide for those who were passing suddenly
from a condition of bondage to a state of freedom. But this bill proposes to make the Freedmen's
Bureau, established by the act of 1865 as one of many great and extraordinary military measures
to suppress a formidable rebellion, a permanent branch of the public administration, with its
powers greatly enlarged. I have no reason to suppose, and I do not understand it to be alleged,
that the act of March, 1865, has proved deficient for the purpose for which it was passed,
although at that time and for a considerable period thereafter the Government of the United
States remained unacknowledged in most of the States whose inhabitants had been involved in
the rebellion. The institution of slavery, for the military destruction of which the Freedmen's
Bureau was called into existence as an auxiliary, has been already effectually and finally
abrogated throughout the whole country by an amendment of the Constitution of the United States,
and practically its eradication has received the assent and concurrence of most of those States
in which it at any time had an existence. I am not, therefore, able to discern in the condition
of the country anything to justify an apprehension that the powers and agencies of the Freedmen's
Bureau, which were effective for the protection of freedmen and refugees during the actual
continuance of hostilities and of African servitude, will now, in a time of peace and after
the abolition of slavery, prove inadequate to the same proper ends. If I am correct in these
views, there can be no necessity for the enlargement of the powers of the Bureau, for which
provision is made in the bill.

The third section of the bill authorizes a general and unlimited grant of support to the destitute
and suffering refugees and freedmen, their wives and children. Succeeding sections make provision
for the rent or purchase of landed estates for freedmen, and for the erection for their benefit
of suitable buildings for asylums and schools, the expenses to be defrayed from the Treasury
of the whole people. The Congress of the United States has never heretofore thought itself
empowered to establish asylums beyond the limits of the District of Columbia, except for the
benefit of our disabled soldiers and sailors. It has never founded schools for any class of
our own people, not even for the orphans of those who have fallen in the defense of the Union,
but has left the care of education to the much more competent and efficient control of the
States, of communities, of private associations, and of individuals. It has never deemed itself
authorized to expend the public money for the rent or purchase of homes for the thousands,
not to say millions, of the white race who are honestly toiling from day to day for their subsistence.
A system for the support of indigent persons in the United States was never contemplated by
the authors of the Constitution; nor can any good reason be advanced why, as a permanent establishment,
it should be founded for one class or color of our people more than another. Pending the war
many refugees and freedmen received support from the Government, but it was never intended
that they should thenceforth be fed, clothed, educated, and sheltered by the United States.
The idea on which the slaves were assisted to freedom was that on becoming free they would
be a self-sustaining population. Any legislation that shall imply that they are not expected
to attain a self-sustaining condition must have a tendency injurious alike to their character
and their prospects.

The appointment of an agent for every county and parish will create an immense patronage, and
the expense of the numerous officers and their clerks, to be appointed by the President, will
be great in the beginning, with a tendency steadily to increase. The appropriations asked by
the Freedmen's Bureau as now established, for the year 1866, amount to $11,745,000. It may
be safely estimated that the cost to be incurred under the pending bill will require double
that amount--more than the entire sum expended in any one year under the Administration of
the second Adams. If the presence of agents in every parish and county is to be considered
as a war measure, opposition, or even resistance, might be provoked; so that to give effect
to their jurisdiction troops would have to be stationed within reach of every one of them,
and thus a large standing force be rendered necessary. Large appropriations would therefore
be required to sustain and enforce military jurisdiction in every county or parish from the
Potomac to the Rio Grande. The condition of our fiscal affairs is encouraging, but in order
to sustain the present measure of public confidence it is necessary that we practice not merely
customary economy, but, as far as possible, severe retrenchment. It does not appear that a
part of the lands to which this section refers may not be owned by minors or persons of unsound
mind, or by those who have been faithful to all their obligations as citizens of the United
States. If any portion of the land is held by such persons, it is not competent for any authority
to deprive them of it. If, on the other hand, it be found that the property is liable to confiscation,
even then it can not be appropriated to public purposes until by due process of law it shall
have been declared forfeited to the Government.

There is still further objection to the bill, on grounds seriously affecting the class of persons
to whom it is designed to bring relief. It will tend to keep the mind of the freedman in a
state of uncertain expectation and restlessness, while to those among whom he lives it will
be a source of constant and vague apprehension.

Undoubtedly the freedman should be protected, but he should be protected by the civil authorities,
especially by the exercise of all the constitutional powers of the courts of the United States
and of the States. His condition is not so exposed as may at first be imagined. He is in a
portion of the country where his labor can not well be spared. Competition for his services
from planters, from those who are constructing or repairing railroads, and from capitalists
in his vicinage or from other States will enable him to command almost his own terms. He also
possesses a perfect right to change his place of abode, and if, therefore, he does not find
in one community or State a mode of life suited to his desires or proper remuneration for his
labor, he can move to another where that labor is more esteemed and better rewarded. In truth,
however, each State, induced by its own wants and interests, will do what is necessary and
proper to retain within its borders all the labor that is needed for the development of its
resources. The laws that regulate supply and demand will maintain their force, and the wages
of the laborer will be regulated thereby. There is no danger that the exceedingly great demand
for labor will not operate in favor of the laborer.

Neither is sufficient consideration given to the ability of the freedmen to protect and take
care of themselves. It is no more than justice to them to believe that as they have received
their freedom with moderation and forbearance, so they will distinguish themselves by their
industry and thrift, and soon show the world that in a condition of freedom they are self-sustaining,
capable of selecting their own employment and their own places of abode, of insisting for themselves
on a proper remuneration, and of establishing and maintaining their own asylums and schools.
It is earnestly hoped that instead of wasting away they will by their own efforts establish
for themselves a condition of respectability and prosperity. It is certain that they can attain
to that condition only through their own merits and exertions.

In this connection the query presents itself whether the system proposed by the bill will not,
when put into complete operation, practically transfer the entire care, support, and control
of 4,000,000 emancipated slaves to agents, overseers, or taskmasters, who, appointed at Washington,
are to be located in every county and parish throughout the United States containing freedmen
and refugees. Such a system would inevitably tend to a concentration of power in the Executive
which would enable him, if so disposed, to control the action of this numerous class and use
them for the attainment of his own political ends.

I can not but add another very grave objection to this bill. The Constitution imperatively
declares, in connection with taxation, that each State shall have at least one Representative,
and fixes the rule for the number to which, in future times, each State shall be entitled.
It also provides that the Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from
each State, and adds with peculiar force "that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived
of its equal suffrage in the Senate." The original act was necessarily passed in the absence
of the States chiefly to be affected, because their people were then contumaciously engaged
in the rebellion. Now the case is changed, and some, at least, of those States are attending
Congress by loyal representatives, soliciting the allowance of the constitutional right for
representation. At the time, however, of the consideration and the passing of this bill there
was no Senator or Representative in Congress from the eleven States which are to be mainly
affected by its provisions. The very fact that reports were and are made against the good disposition
of the people of that portion of the country is an additional reason why they need and should
have representatives of their own in Congress to explain their condition, reply to accusations,
and assist by their local knowledge in the perfecting of measures immediately affecting themselves.
While the liberty of deliberation would then be free and Congress would have full power to
decide according to its judgment, there could be no objection urged that the States most interested
had not been permitted to be heard. The principle is firmly fixed in the minds of the American
people that there should be no taxation without representation. Great burdens have now to be
borne by all the country, and we may best demand that they shall be borne without murmur when
they are voted by a majority of the representatives of all the people. I would not interfere
with the unquestionable right of Congress to judge, each House for itself, "of the elections,
returns, and qualifications of its own members;" but that authority can not be construed as
including the right to shut out in time of peace any State from the representation to which
it is entitled by the Constitution. At present all the people of eleven States are excluded--those
who were most faithful during the war not less than others. The State of Tennessee, for instance,
whose authorities engaged in rebellion, was restored to all her constitutional relations to
the Union by the patriotism and energy of her injured and betrayed people. Before the war was
brought to a termination they had placed themselves in relations with the General Government,
had established a State government of their own, and, as they were not included in the emancipation
proclamation, they by their own act had amended their constitution so as to abolish slavery
within the limits of their State. I know no reason why the State of Tennessee, for example,
should not fully enjoy "all her constitutional relations to the United States."

The President of the United States stands toward the country in a somewhat different attitude
from that of any member of Congress. Each member of Congress is chosen from a single district
or State; the President is chosen by the people of all the States. As eleven States are not
at this time represented in either branch of Congress, it would seem to be his duty on all
proper occasions to present their just claims to Congress. There always will be differences
of opinion in the community, and individuals may be guilty of transgressions of the law, but
these do not constitute valid objections against the right of a State to representation. I
would in no wise interfere with the discretion of Congress with regard to the qualifications
of members; but I hold it my duty to recommend to you, in the interests of peace and the interests
of union, the admission of every State to its share in public legislation when, however insubordinate,
insurgent, or rebellious its people may have been, it presents itself, not only in an attitude
of loyalty and harmony, but in the persons of representatives whose loyalty can not be questioned
under any existing constitutional or legal test. It is plain that an indefinite or permanent
exclusion of any part of the country from representation must be attended by a spirit of disquiet
and complaint. It is unwise and dangerous to pursue a course of measures which will unite a
very large section of the country against another section of the country, however much the
latter may preponderate. The course of emigration, the development of industry and business,
and natural causes will raise up at the South men as devoted to the Union as those of any other
part of the land; but if they are all excluded from Congress, if in a permanent statute they
are declared not to be in full constitutional relations to the country, they may think they
have cause to become a unit in feeling and sentiment against the Government. Under the political
education of the American people the idea is inherent and ineradicable that the consent of
the majority of the whole people is necessary to secure a willing acquiescence in legislation.

The bill under consideration refers to certain of the States as though they had not "been fully
restored in all their constitutional relations to the United States." If they have not, let
us at once act together to secure that desirable end at the earliest possible moment. It is
hardly necessary for me to inform Congress that in my own judgment most of those States, so
far, at least, as depends upon their own action, have already been fully restored, and are
to be deemed as entitled to enjoy their constitutional rights as members of the Union. Reasoning
from the Constitution itself and from the actual situation of the country, I feel not only
entitled but bound to assume that with the Federal courts restored and those of the several
States in the full exercise of their functions the rights and interests of all classes of people
will, with the aid of the military in cases of resistance to the laws, be essentially protected
against unconstitutional infringement or violation. Should this expectation unhappily fail,
which I do not anticipate, then the Executive is already fully armed with the powers conferred
by the act of March, 1865, establishing the Freedmen's Bureau, and hereafter, as heretofore,
he can employ the land and naval forces of the country to suppress insurrection or to overcome
obstructions to the laws.

In accordance with the Constitution, I return the bill to the Senate, in the earnest hope that
a measure involving questions and interests so important to the country will not become a law,
unless upon deliberate consideration by the people it shall receive the sanction of an enlightened
public judgment.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., March 27, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

I regret that the bill, which has passed both Houses of Congress, entitled "An act to protect
all persons in the United States in their civil rights and furnish the means of their vindication,"
contains provisions which I can not approve consistently with my sense of duty to the whole
people and my obligations to the Constitution of the United States. I am therefore constrained
to return it to the Senate, the House in which it originated, with my objections to its becoming
a law.

By the first section of the bill all persons born in the United States and not subject to any
foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are declared to be citizens of the United States.
This provision comprehends the Chinese of the Pacific States, Indians subject to taxation,
the people called gypsies, as well as the entire race designated as blacks, people of color,
negroes, mulattoes, and persons of African blood. Every individual of these races born in the
United States is by the bill made a citizen of the United States. It does not purport to declare
or confer any other right of citizenship than Federal citizenship. It does not purport to give
these classes of persons any status as citizens of States, except that which may result from
their status as citizens of the United States. The power to confer the right of State citizenship
is just as exclusively with the several States as the power to confer the right of Federal
citizenship is with Congress.

The right of Federal citizenship thus to be conferred on the several excepted races before
mentioned is now for the first time proposed to be given by law. If, as is claimed by many,
all persons who are native born already are, by virtue of the Constitution, citizens of the
United States, the passage of the pending bill can not be necessary to make them such. If,
on the other hand, such persons are not citizens, as may be assumed from the proposed legislation
to make them such, the grave question presents itself whether, when eleven of the thirty-six
States are unrepresented in Congress at the present time, it is sound policy to make our entire
colored population and all other excepted classes citizens of the United States. Four millions
of them have just emerged from slavery into freedom. Can it be reasonably supposed that they
possess the requisite qualifications to entitle them to all the privileges and immunities of
citizens of the United States? Have the people of the several States expressed such a conviction?
It may also be asked whether it is necessary that they should be declared citizens in order
that they may be secured in the enjoyment of the civil rights proposed to be conferred by the
bill. Those rights are, by Federal as well as State laws, secured to all domiciled aliens and
foreigners, even before the completion of the process of naturalization; and it may safely
be assumed that the same enactments are sufficient to give like protection and benefits to
those for whom this bill provides special legislation. Besides, the policy of the Government
from its origin to the present time seems to have been that persons who are strangers to and
unfamiliar with our institutions and our laws should pass through a certain probation, at the
end of which, before attaining the coveted prize, they must give evidence of their fitness
to receive and to exercise the rights of citizens as contemplated by the Constitution of the
United States. The bill in effect proposes a discrimination against large numbers of intelligent,
worthy, and patriotic foreigners, and in favor of the negro, to whom, after long years of bondage,
the avenues to freedom and intelligence have just now been suddenly opened. He must of necessity,
from his previous unfortunate condition of servitude, be less informed as to the nature and
character of our institutions than he who, coming from abroad, has, to some extent at least,
familiarized himself with the principles of a Government to which he voluntarily intrusts "life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Yet it is now proposed, by a single legislative enactment,
to confer the rights of citizens upon all persons of African descent born within the extended
limits of the United States, while persons of foreign birth who make our land their home must
undergo a probation of five years, and can only then become citizens upon proof that they are
"of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States,
and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same."

The first section of the bill also contains an enumeration of the rights to be enjoyed by these
classes so made citizens "in every State and Territory in the United States." These rights
are "to make and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties, and give evidence; to inherit, purchase,
lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property," and to have "full and equal benefit
of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white
citizens." So, too, they are made subject to the same punishment, pains, and penalties in common
with white citizens, and to none other. Thus a perfect equality of the white and colored races
is attempted to be fixed by Federal law in every State of the Union over the vast field of
State jurisdiction covered by these enumerated rights. In no one of these can any State ever
exercise any power of discrimination between the different races. In the exercise of State
policy over matters exclusively affecting the people of each State it has frequently been thought
expedient to discriminate between the two races. By the statutes of some of the States, Northern
as well as Southern, it is enacted, for instance, that no white person shall intermarry with
a negro or mulatto. Chancellor Kent says, speaking of the blacks, that--

  Marriages between them and the whites are forbidden in some of the
  States where slavery does not exist, and they are prohibited in all the
  slaveholding States; and when not absolutely contrary to law, they are
  revolting, and regarded as an offense against public decorum.

I do not say that this bill repeals State laws on the subject of marriage between the two races,
for as the whites are forbidden to intermarry with the blacks, the blacks can only make such
contracts as the whites themselves are allowed to make, and therefore can not under this bill
enter into the marriage contract with the whites. I cite this discrimination, however, as an
instance of the State policy as to discrimination, and to inquire whether if Congress can abrogate
all State laws of discrimination between the two races in the matter of real estate, of suits,
and of contracts generally Congress may not also repeal the State laws as to the contract of
marriage between the two races. Hitherto every subject embraced in the enumeration of rights
contained in this bill has been considered as exclusively belonging to the States. They all
relate to the internal police and economy of the respective States. They are matters which
in each State concern the domestic condition of its people, varying in each according to its
own peculiar circumstances and the safety and well-being of its own citizens. I do not mean
to say that upon all these subjects there are not Federal restraints--as, for instance, in
the State power of legislation over contracts there is a Federal limitation that no State shall
pass a law impairing the obligations of contracts; and, as to crimes, that no State shall pass
an ex post facto law; and, as to money, that no State shall make anything but gold and silver
a legal tender; but where can we find a Federal prohibition against the power of any State
to discriminate, as do most of them, between aliens and citizens, between artificial persons,
called corporations, and natural persons, in the right to hold real estate? If it be granted
that Congress can repeal all State laws discriminating between whites and blacks in the subjects
covered by this bill, why, it may be asked, may not Congress repeal in the same way all State
laws discriminating between the two races on the subjects of suffrage and office? If Congress
can declare by law who shall hold lands, who shall testify, who shall have capacity to make
a contract in a State, then Congress can by law also declare who, without regard to color or
race, shall have the right to sit as a juror or as a judge, to hold any office, and, finally,
to vote "in every State and Territory of the United States." As respects the Territories, they
come within the power of Congress, for as to them the lawmaking power is the Federal power;
but as to the States no similar provision exists vesting in Congress the power "to make rules
and regulations" for them.

The object of the second section of the bill is to afford discriminating protection to colored
persons in the full enjoyment of all the rights secured to them by the preceding section. It
declares--

  That any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance,
  regulation, or custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any
  inhabitant of any State or Territory to the deprivation of any right
  secured or protected by this act, or to different punishment, pains, or
  penalties on account of such person having at any time been held in a
  condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
  for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, or by reason
  of his color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white
  persons, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction
  shall be punished by fine not exceeding $1,000, or imprisonment not
  exceeding one year, or both, in the discretion of the court.

This section seems to be designed to apply to some existing or future law of a State or Territory
which may conflict with the provisions of the bill now under consideration. It provides for
counteracting such forbidden legislation by imposing fine and imprisonment upon the legislators
who may pass such conflicting laws, or upon the officers or agents who shall put or attempt
to put them into execution. It means an official offense, not a common crime committed against
law upon the persons or property of the black race. Such an act may deprive the black man of
his property, but not of the right to hold property. It means a deprivation of the right itself,
either by the State judiciary or the State legislature. It is therefore assumed that under
this section members of State legislatures who should vote for laws conflicting with the provisions
of the bill, that judges of the State courts who should render judgments in antagonism with
its terms, and that marshals and sheriffs who should, as ministerial officers, execute processes
sanctioned by State laws and issued by State judges in execution of their judgments could be
brought before other tribunals and there subjected to fine and imprisonment for the performance
of the duties which such State laws might impose. The legislation thus proposed invades the
judicial power of the State. It says to every State court or judge, If you decide that this
act is unconstitutional; if you refuse, under the prohibition of a State law, to allow a negro
to testify; if you hold that over such a subject-matter the State law is paramount, and "under
color" of a State law refuse the exercise of the right to the negro, your error of judgment,
however conscientious, shall subject you to fine and imprisonment. I do not apprehend that
the conflicting legislation which the bill seems to contemplate is so likely to occur as to
render it necessary at this time to adopt a measure of such doubtful constitutionality.

In the next place, this provision of the bill seems to be unnecessary, as adequate judicial
remedies could be adopted to secure the desired end without invading the immunities of legislators,
always important to be preserved in the interest of public liberty; without assailing the independence
of the judiciary, always essential to the preservation of individual rights; and without impairing
the efficiency of ministerial officers, always necessary for the maintenance of public peace
and order. The remedy proposed by this section seems to be in this respect not only anomalous,
but unconstitutional; for the Constitution guarantees nothing with certainty if it does not
insure to the several States the right of making and executing laws in regard to all matters
arising within their jurisdiction, subject only to the restriction that in cases of conflict
with the Constitution and constitutional laws of the United States the latter should be held
to be the supreme law of the land.

The third section gives the district courts of the United States exclusive "cognizance of all
crimes and offenses committed against the provisions of this act," and concurrent jurisdiction
with the circuit courts of the United States of all civil and criminal cases "affecting persons
who are denied or can not enforce in the courts or judicial tribunals of the State or locality
where they may be any of the rights secured to them by the first section." The construction
which I have given to the second section is strengthened by this third section, for it makes
clear what kind of denial or deprivation of the rights secured by the first section was in
contemplation. It is a denial or deprivation of such rights "in the courts or judicial tribunals
of the State." It stands, therefore, clear of doubt that the offense and the penalties provided
in the second section are intended for the State judge who, in the clear exercise of his functions
as a judge, not acting ministerially but judicially, shall decide contrary to this Federal
law. In other words, when a State judge, acting upon a question involving a conflict between
a State law and a Federal law, and bound, according to his own judgment and responsibility,
to give an impartial decision between the two, comes to the conclusion that the State law is
valid and the Federal law is invalid, he must not follow the dictates of his own judgment,
at the peril of fine and imprisonment. The legislative department of the Government of the
United States thus takes from the judicial department of the States the sacred and exclusive
duty of judicial decision, and converts the State judge into a mere ministerial officer, bound
to decide according to the will of Congress.

It is clear that in States which deny to persons whose rights are secured by the first section
of the bill any one of those rights all criminal and civil cases affecting them will, by the
provisions of the third section, come under the exclusive cognizance of the Federal tribunals.
It follows that if, in any State which denies to a colored person any one of all those rights,
that person should commit a crime against the laws of a State--murder, arson, rape, or any
other crime--all protection and punishment through the courts of the State are taken away,
and he can only be tried and punished in the Federal courts. How is the criminal to be tried?
If the offense is provided for and punished by Federal law, that law, and not the State law,
is to govern. It is only when the offense does not happen to be within the purview of Federal
law that the Federal courts are to try and punish him under any other law. Then resort is to
be had to "the common law, as modified and changed" by State legislation, "so far as the same
is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States." So that over this
vast domain of criminal jurisprudence provided by each State for the protection of its own
citizens and for the punishment of all persons who violate its criminal laws, Federal law,
whenever it can be made to apply, displaces State law. The question here naturally arises,
from what source Congress derives the power to transfer to Federal tribunals certain classes
of cases embraced in this section. Here the judicial power of the United States is expressly
set forth and defined; and the act of September 24, 1789, establishing the judicial courts
of the United States, in conferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction over cases originating
in State tribunals, is careful to confine them to the classes enumerated in the above-recited
clause of the Constitution. This section of the bill undoubtedly comprehends cases and authorizes
the exercise of powers that are not, by the Constitution, within the jurisdiction of the courts
of the United States. To transfer them to those courts would be an exercise of authority well
calculated to excite distrust and alarm on the part of all the States, for the bill applies
alike to all of them--as well to those that have as to those that have not been engaged in
rebellion.

It may be assumed that this authority is incident to the power granted to Congress by the Constitution,
as recently amended, to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the article declaring that--

  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for
  crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist
  within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

It can not, however, be justly claimed that, with a view to the enforcement of this article
of the Constitution, there is at present any necessity for the exercise of all the powers which
this bill confers. Slavery has been abolished, and at present nowhere exists within the jurisdiction
of the United States; nor has there been, nor is it likely there will be, any attempt to revive
it by the people or the States. If, however, any such attempt shall be made, it will then become
the duty of the General Government to exercise any and all incidental powers necessary and
proper to maintain inviolate this great constitutional law of freedom.

The fourth section of the bill provides that officers and agents of the Freedmen's Bureau shall
be empowered to make arrests, and also that other officers may be specially commissioned for
that purpose by the President of the United States. It also authorizes circuit courts of the
United States and the superior courts of the Territories to appoint, without limitation, commissioners,
who are to be charged with the performance of quasi judicial duties. The fifth section empowers
the commissioners so to be selected by the courts to appoint in writing, under their hands,
one or more suitable persons from time to time to execute warrants and other processes described
by the bill. These numerous official agents are made to constitute a sort of police, in addition
to the military, and are authorized to summon a posse comitatus, and even to call to their
aid such portion of the land and naval forces of the United States, or of the militia, "as
may be necessary to the performance of the duty with which they are charged." This extraordinary
power is to be conferred upon agents irresponsible to the Government and to the people, to
whose number the discretion of the commissioners is the only limit, and in whose hands such
authority might be made a terrible engine of wrong, oppression, and fraud. The general statutes
regulating the land and naval forces of the United States, the militia, and the execution of
the laws are believed to be adequate for every emergency which can occur in time of peace.
If it should prove otherwise, Congress can at any time amend those laws in such manner as,
while subserving the public welfare, not to jeopard the rights, interests, and liberties of
the people.

The seventh section provides that a fee of $10 shall be paid to each commissioner in every
case brought before him, and a fee of $5 to his deputy or deputies "for each person he or they
may arrest and take before any such commissioner," "with such other fees as may be deemed reasonable
by such commissioner," "in general for performing such other duties as may be required in the
premises." All these fees are to be "paid out of the Treasury of the United States," whether
there is a conviction or not; but in case of conviction they are to be recoverable from the
defendant. It seems to me that under the influence of such temptations bad men might convert
any law, however beneficent, into an instrument of persecution and fraud.

By the eighth section of the bill the United States courts, which sit only in one place for
white citizens, must migrate with the marshal and district attorney (and necessarily with the
clerk, although he is not mentioned) to any part of the district upon the order of the President,
and there hold a court, "for the purpose of the more speedy arrest and trial of persons charged
with a violation of this act;" and there the judge and officers of the court must remain, upon
the order of the President, "for the time therein designated." This language seems to imply
a permanent military force, that is to be always at hand, and whose only business is to be
the enforcement of this measure over the vast region where it is intended to operate.

I do not propose to consider the policy of this bill. To me the details of the bill seem fraught
with evil. The white race and the black race of the South have hitherto lived together under
the relation of master and slave--capital owning labor. Now, suddenly, that relation is changed,
and as to ownership capital and labor are divorced. They stand now each master of itself. In
this new relation, one being necessary to the other, there will be a new adjustment, which
both are deeply interested in making harmonious. Each has equal power in settling the terms,
and if left to the laws that regulate capital and labor it is confidently believed that they
will satisfactorily work out the problem. Capital, it is true, has more intelligence, but labor
is never so ignorant as not to understand its own interests, not to know its own value, and
not to see that capital must pay that value.

This bill frustrates this adjustment. It intervenes between capital and labor and attempts
to settle questions of political economy through the agency of numerous officials whose interest
it will be to foment discord between the two races, for as the breach widens their employment
will continue, and when it is closed their occupation will terminate.

In all our history, in all our experience as a people living under Federal and State law, no
such system as that contemplated by the details of this bill has ever before been proposed
or adopted. They establish for the security of the colored race safeguards which go infinitely
beyond any that the General Government has ever provided for the white race. In fact, the distinction
of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white
race. They interfere with the municipal legislation of the States, with the relations existing
exclusively between a State and its citizens, or between inhabitants of the same State--an
absorption and assumption of power by the General Government which, if acquiesced in, must
sap and destroy our federative system of limited powers and break down the barriers which preserve
the rights of the States. It is another step, or rather stride, toward centralization and the
concentration of all legislative powers in the National Government. The tendency of the bill
must be to resuscitate the spirit of rebellion and to arrest the progress of those influences
which are more closely drawing around the States the bonds of union and peace.

My lamented predecessor, in his proclamation of the 1st of January, 1863, ordered and declared
that all persons held as slaves within certain States and parts of States therein designated
were and thenceforward should be free; and further, that the executive government of the United
States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, would recognize and maintain
the freedom of such persons. This guaranty has been rendered especially obligatory and sacred
by the amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States. I therefore
fully recognize the obligation to protect and defend that class of our people whenever and
wherever it shall become necessary, and to the full extent compatible with the Constitution
of the United States.

Entertaining these sentiments, it only remains for me to say that I will cheerfully cooperate
with Congress in any measure that may be necessary for the protection of the civil rights of
the freedmen, as well as those of all other classes of persons throughout the United States,
by judicial process, under equal and impartial laws, in conformity with the provisions of the
Federal Constitution.

I now return the bill to the Senate, and regret that in considering the bills and joint resolutions--forty-two
in number--which have been thus far submitted for my approval I am compelled to withhold my
assent from a second measure that has received the sanction of both Houses of Congress.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., May 15, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

I return to the Senate, in which House it originated, the bill, which has passed both Houses
of Congress, entitled "An act for the admission of the State of Colorado into the Union," with
my objections to its becoming a law at this time.

First. From the best information which I have been able to obtain I do not consider the establishment
of a State government at present necessary for the welfare of the people of Colorado. Under
the existing Territorial government all the rights, privileges, and interests of the citizens
are protected and secured. The qualified voters choose their own legislators and their own
local officers, and are represented in Congress by a Delegate of their own selection. They
make and execute their own municipal laws, subject only to revision by Congress--an authority
not likely to be exercised unless in extreme or extraordinary cases. The population is small,
some estimating it so low as 25,000, while advocates of the bill reckon the number at from
35,000 to 40,000 souls. The people are principally recent settlers, many of whom are understood
to be ready for removal to other mining districts beyond the limits of the Territory if circumstances
shall render them more inviting. Such a population can not but find relief from excessive taxation
if the Territorial system, which devolves the expenses of the executive, legislative, and judicial
departments upon the United States, is for the present continued. They can not but find the
security of person and property increased by their reliance upon the national executive power
for the maintenance of law and order against the disturbances necessarily incident to all newly
organized communities.

Second. It is not satisfactorily established that a majority of the citizens of Colorado desire
or are prepared for an exchange of a Territorial for a State government. In September, 1864,
under the authority of Congress, an election was lawfully appointed and held for the purpose
of ascertaining the views of the people upon this particular question. Six thousand one hundred
and ninety-two votes were cast, and of this number a majority of 3,152 was given against the
proposed change. In September, 1865, without any legal authority, the question was again presented
to the people of the Territory, with the view of obtaining a reconsideration of the result
of the election held in compliance with the act of Congress approved March 21, 1864. At this
second election 5,905 votes were polled, and a majority of 155 was given in favor of a State
organization. It does not seem to me entirely safe to receive this, the last-mentioned, result,
so irregularly obtained, as sufficient to outweigh the one which had been legally obtained
in the first election. Regularity and conformity to law are essential to the preservation of
order and stable government, and should, as far as practicable, always be observed in the formation
of new States.

Third. The admission of Colorado at this time as a State into the Federal Union appears to
me to be incompatible with the public interests of the country. While it is desirable that
Territories, when sufficiently matured, should be organized as States, yet the spirit of the
Constitution seems to require that there should be an approximation toward equality among the
several States composing the Union. No State can have less or more than two Senators in Congress.
The largest State has a population of 4,000,000; several of the States have a population exceeding
2,000,000, and many others have a population exceeding 1,000,000. A population of 127,000 is
the ratio of apportionment of Representatives among the several States.

If this bill should become a law, the people of Colorado, 30,000 in number, would have in the
House of Representatives one member, while New York, with a population of 4,000,000, has but
thirty-one; Colorado would have in the electoral college three votes, while New York has only
thirty-three; Colorado would have in the Senate two votes, while New York has no more.

Inequalities of this character have already occurred, but it is believed that none have happened
where the inequality was so great. When such inequality has been allowed, Congress is supposed
to have permitted it on the ground of some high public necessity and under circumstances which
promised that it would rapidly disappear through the growth and development of the newly admitted
State. Thus, in regard to the several States in what was formerly called the "Northwest Territory,"
lying east of the Mississippi, their rapid advancement in population rendered it certain that
States admitted with only one or two Representatives in Congress would in a very short period
be entitled to a great increase of representation. So, when California was admitted, on the
ground of commercial and political exigencies, it was well foreseen that that State was destined
rapidly to become a great, prosperous, and important mining and commercial community. In the
case of Colorado, I am not aware that any national exigency, either of a political or commercial
nature, requires a departure from the law of equality which has been so generally adhered to
in our history.

If information submitted in connection with this bill is reliable, Colorado, instead of increasing,
has declined in population. At an election for members of a Territorial legislature held in
1861, 10,580 votes were cast; at the election before mentioned, in 1864, the number of votes
cast was 6,192; while at the irregular election held in 1865, which is assumed as a basis for
legislative action at this time, the aggregate of votes was 5,905. Sincerely anxious for the
welfare and prosperity of every Territory and State, as well as for the prosperity and welfare
of the whole Union, I regret this apparent decline of population in Colorado; but it is manifest
that it is due to emigration which is going on from that Territory into other regions within
the United States, which either are in fact or are believed by the inhabitants of Colorado
to be richer in mineral wealth and agricultural resources. If, however, Colorado has not really
declined in population, another census or another election under the authority of Congress
would place the question beyond doubt, and cause but little delay in the ultimate admission
of the Territory as a State if desired by the people.

The tenor of these objections furnishes the reply which may be expected to an argument in favor
of the measure derived from the enabling act which was passed by Congress on the 21st day of
March, 1864. Although Congress then supposed that the condition of the Territory was such as
to warrant its admission as a State, the result of two years' experience shows that every reason
which existed for the institution of a Territorial instead of a State government in Colorado
at its first organization still continues in force.

The condition of the Union at the present moment is calculated to inspire caution in regard
to the admission of new States. Eleven of the old States have been for some time, and still
remain, unrepresented in Congress. It is a common interest of all the States, as well those
represented as those unrepresented, that the integrity and harmony of the Union should be restored
as completely as possible, so that all those who are expected to bear the burdens of the Federal
Government shall be consulted concerning the admission of new States; and that in the meantime
no new State shall be prematurely and unnecessarily admitted to a participation in the political
power which the Federal Government wields, not for the benefit of any individual State or section,
but for the common safety, welfare, and happiness of the whole country.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., June 15, 1866.

To the Senate of the United States:

The bill entitled "An act to enable the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing
Company to purchase a certain amount of the public lands not now in market" is herewith returned
to the Senate, in which it originated, with the objections which induce me to withhold my approval.

By the terms of this bill the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company are
authorized, at any time within one year after the date of approval, to preempt two tracts of
land in the Territory of Montana, not exceeding in the aggregate twenty sections, and not included
in any Indian reservation or in any Government reservation for military or other purposes.
Three of these sections may be selected from lands containing iron ore and coal, and the remainder
from timber lands lying near thereto. These selections are to be made under regulations from
the Secretary of the Interior and be subject to his approval. The company, on the selection
of the lands, may acquire immediate possession by permanently marking their boundaries and
publishing description thereof in any two newspapers of general circulation in the Territory
of Montana. Patents are to be issued on the performance, within two years, of the following
conditions:

First. The lands to be surveyed at the expense of the company, and each tract to be "as nearly
in a square form as may be practicable."

Second. The company to furnish evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior that
they have erected and have in operation in one or more places on said lands iron works capable
of manufacturing at least 1,500 tons of iron per annum.

Third. The company to have paid for said lands the minimum price of $1.25 per acre.

It is also provided that the "patents shall convey no title to any mineral lands except iron
and coal, or to any lands held by right of possession, or by any other title, except Indian
title, valid at the time of the selection of the said lands." The company are to have the privileges
of ordinary preemptors and be subject to the same restrictions as such preemptors with reference
to wood and timber on the lands, with the exception of so much as may be necessarily used in
the erection of buildings and in the legitimate business of manufacturing iron.

The parties upon whom these privileges are conferred are designated in the bill as "The New
York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company." Their names and residence not being
disclosed, it must be inferred that this company is a corporation, which, under color of corporate
powers derived from some State or Territorial legislative authority, proposes to carry on the
business of mining and manufacturing iron, and to accomplish these ends seeks this grant of
public land in Montana. Two questions thus arise, viz, whether the privileges the bill would
confer should be granted to any person or persons, and, secondly, whether, if unobjectionable
in other respects, they should be conferred upon a corporation.

The public domain is a national trust, set apart and held for the general welfare upon principles
of equal justice, and not to be bestowed as a special privilege upon a favored class. The proper
rules for the disposal of public land have from the earliest period been the subject of earnest
inquiry, grave discussion, and deliberate judgment. The purpose of direct revenue was the first
object, and this was attained by public sale to the highest bidder, and subsequently by the
right of private purchase at a fixed minimum. It was soon discovered that the surest and most
speedy means of promoting the wealth and prosperity of the country was by encouraging actual
settlement and occupation, and hence a system of preemption rights, resulting most beneficially,
in all the Western Territories. By progressive steps it has advanced to the homestead principle,
securing to every head of a family, widow, and single man 21 years of age and to every soldier
who has borne arms for his country a landed estate sufficient, with industry, for the purpose
of independent support.

Without tracing the system of preemption laws through the several stages, it is sufficient
to observe that it rests upon certain just and plain principles, firmly established in all
our legislation. The object of these laws is to encourage the expansion of population and the
development of agricultural interests, and hence they have been invariably restricted to settlers.
Actual residence and cultivation are made indispensable conditions; and, to guard the privilege
from abuses of speculation or monopoly, the law is rigid as to the mode of establishing claims
by adequate testimony, with penalties for perjury. Mining, trading, or any pursuit other than
culture of the soil is interdicted, mineral lands being expressly excluded from preemption
privileges, excepting those containing coal, which, in quantities not exceeding 160 acres,
are restricted to individuals in actual possession and commerce, with an enhanced minimum of
$20 per acre.

For a quarter of a century the quantity of land subject to agricultural preemption has been
limited so as not to exceed a quarter section, or 160 acres; and, still further to guard against
monopoly, the privilege of preemption is not allowed to any person who owns 320 acres of land
in any State or Territory of the United States, nor is any person entitled to more than one
preemptive right, nor is it extended to lands to which the Indian usufruct has not been extinguished.
To restrict the privilege within reasonable limits, credit to the ordinary preemptor on offered
land is not extended beyond twelve months, within which time the minimum price must be paid.
Where the settlement is upon unoffered territory, the time for payment is limited to the day
of public offering designated by proclamation of the President; while, to prevent depreciation
of the land by waste or destruction of what may constitute its value, penal enactments have
been made for the punishment of persons depredating upon public timber.

Now, supposing the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company to be entitled
to all the preemption rights which it has been found just and expedient to bestow upon natural
persons, it will be seen that the privileges conferred by the bill in question are in direct
conflict with every principle heretofore observed in respect to the disposal of the public lands.

The bill confers preemption right to mineral lands, which, excepting coal lands, at an enhanced
minimum, have heretofore, as a general principle, been carefully excluded from preemption.
The object of the company is not to cultivate the soil or to promote agriculture, but is for
the sole purpose of mining and manufacturing iron. The company is not limited, like ordinary
preemptors, to one preemptive claim of a quarter section, but may preempt two bodies of land,
amounting in the aggregate to twenty sections, containing 12,800 acres, or eighty ordinary
individual preemption rights. The timber is not protected, but, on the contrary, is devoted
to speedy destruction; for even before the consummation of title the company are allowed to
consume whatever may be necessary in the erection of buildings and the business of manufacturing
iron. For these special privileges, in contravention of the land policy of so many years, the
company are required to pay only the minimum price of $1.25 per acre, or one-sixteenth of the
established minimum, and are granted a credit of two years, or twice the time allowed ordinary
preemptors on offered lands.

Nor is this all. The preemption right in question covers three sections of land containing
iron ore and coal. The act passed on the 1st of July, 1864, made it lawful for the President
to cause tracts embracing coal beds or coal fields to be offered at public sale in suitable
legal subdivisions to the highest bidder, after public notice of not less than three months,
at a minimum price of $20 per acre, and any lands not thus disposed of were thereafter to be
liable to private entry at said minimum. By the act of March 3, 1865, the right of preemption
to coal lands is granted to any citizen of the United States who at that date was engaged in
the business of coal mining on the public domain for purposes of commerce; and he is authorized
to enter, according to legal subdivisions, at the minimum price of $20 per acre, a quantity
of land not exceeding 160 acres, to embrace his improvements and mining premises. Under these
acts the minimum price of three sections of coal lands would be thirty-eight thousand four
hundred dollars ($38,400).

By the bill now in question these sections containing coal and iron are bestowed on this company
at the nominal price of $1.25 per acre, or two thousand four hundred dollars ($2,400), thus
making a gratuity or gift to the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company
of thirty-six thousand dollars ($36,000).

On what ground can such a gratuity to this company be justified, especially at a time when
the burdens of taxation bear so heavily upon all classes of the people?

Less than two years ago it appears to have been the deliberate judgment of Congress that tracts
of land containing coal beds or coal fields should be sold, after three months' notice, to
the bidder at public auction who would give the highest price over $20 per acre, and that a
citizen engaged in the business of actual coal mining on the public domain should only secure
a tract of 160 acres, at private entry, upon payment of $20 per acre and formal and satisfactory
proof that he in all respects came within the requirements of the statute. It can not be that
the coal fields of Montana have depreciated nearly twenty fold in value since July, 1864. So
complete a revolution in the land policy as is manifested by this act can only be ascribed,
therefore, to an inadvertence, which Congress will, I trust, promptly correct.

Believing that the preemption policy--so deliberately adopted, so long practiced, so carefully
guarded with a view to the disposal of the public lands in a manner that would promote the
population and prosperity of the country--should not be perverted to the purposes contemplated
by this bill, I would be constrained to withhold my sanction even if this company were, as
natural persons, entitled to the privileges of ordinary preemptors; for if a corporation, as
the name and the absence of any designation of individuals would denote, the measure before
me is liable to another fatal objection.

Why should incorporated companies have the privileges of individual preemptors? What principle
of justice requires such a policy? What motive of public welfare can fail to condemn it? Lands
held by corporations were regarded by ancient laws as held in mortmain, or by "dead hand,"
and from the time of Magna Charta corporations required the royal license to hold land, because
such holding was regarded as in derogation of public policy and common right. Preemption is
itself a special privilege, only authorized by its supposed public benefit in promoting the
settlement and cultivation of vacant territory and in rewarding the enterprise of the persons
upon whom the privilege is bestowed. "Preemption rights," as declared by the Supreme Court
of the United States, "are founded in an enlightened public policy, rendered necessary by the
enterprise of our citizens. The adventurous pioneer, who is found in advance of our settlements,
encounters many hardships, and not unfrequently dangers from savage incursions. He is generally
poor, and it is fit that his enterprise should be rewarded by the privilege of purchasing the
spot selected by him, not to exceed 160 acres."

It may be said that this company, before they obtain a patent, must prove that within two years
they "have erected and have in operation in one or more places on the said lands iron works
with a capacity for manufacturing at least 1,500 tons of iron per annum." On the other hand,
they are to have possession for two years of more than 12,000 acres of the choice land of the
Territory, of which nearly 2,000 acres are to contain iron ore and coal and over 10,000 acres
to be of timber land selected by themselves. They will thus have the first and exclusive choice.
In fact, they are the only parties who at this time would have any privilege whatever in the
way of obtaining titles in that Territory. Inasmuch as Montana has not yet been organized into
a land district, the general preemption laws for the benefit of individual settlers have not
yet been extended to that country, nor has a single acre of public land in the Territory yet
been surveyed. With such exclusive and extraordinary privileges, how many companies would be
willing to undertake furnaces that would produce 5 tons per day in much less time than two years?

It is plain the pretended consideration on which the patent is to issue bears no just proportion
to that of the ordinary preemptor, and that this bill is but the precursor of a system of land
distribution to a privileged class, unequal, unjust, and which ought not to receive the sanction
of the General Government. Many thousand pioneers have turned their steps to the Western Territories,
seeking, with their wives and children, homesteads to be acquired by sturdy industry under
the preemption laws. On their arrival they should not find the timbered lands and the tracts
containing iron ore and coal already surveyed and claimed by corporate companies, favored by
the special legislation of Congress, and with boundaries fixed even in advance of the public
surveys--a departure from the salutary provision requiring a settler upon unsurveyed lands
to limit the boundaries of his claim to the lines of the public survey after they shall have
been established. He receives a title only to a legal subdivision, including his residence
and improvements. The survey of the company may not accord with that which will hereafter be
made by the Government, while the patent that issues will be descriptive of and confer a title
to the tract as surveyed by the company.

I am aware of no precedent for granting such exclusive rights to a manufacturing company for
a nominal consideration. Congress have made concessions to railway companies of alternate sections
within given limits of the lines of their roads. This policy originated in the belief that
the facilities afforded by reaching the parts of the country remote from the great centers
of population would expedite the settlement and sale of the public domain. These incidental
advantages were secured without pecuniary loss to the Government, by reason of the enhanced
value of the reserved sections, which are held at the double minimum. Mining and manufacturing
companies, however, have always been distinguished from public-improvement corporations. The
former are, in law and in fact, only private associations for trade and business on individual
account and for personal benefit. Admitting the proposition that railroad grants can stand
on sound principle, it is plain that such can not be the case with concessions to companies
like that contemplated by this measure. In view of the strong temptation to monopolize the
public lands, with the pernicious results, it would seem at least of doubtful expediency to
lift corporations above all competition with actual settlers by authorizing them to become
purchasers of public lands in the Territories for any purpose, and particularly when clothed
with the special benefits of this bill. For myself, I am convinced that the privileges of ordinary
preemptors ought not to be extended to incorporated companies.

A third objection may be mentioned, as it exemplifies the spirit in which special privileges
are sought by incorporated companies.

Land subject to Indian occupancy has always been scrupulously guarded by law from preemption
settlement or encroachment under any pretext until the Indian title should be extinguished.
In the fourth section of this act, however, lands held by "Indian title" are excepted from
prohibition against the patent to be issued to the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing
Company.

The bill provides that the patent "shall convey no title to any mineral lands except iron and
coal, or to any lands held by right of possession, or by any other title, except Indian title,
valid at the time of the selection of the said lands." It will be seen that by the first section
lands in "Indian reservations" are excluded from individual preemption right, but by the fourth
section the patent may cover any Indian title except a reservation; so that no matter what
may be the nature of the Indian title, unless it be in a reservation, it is unprotected from
the privilege conceded by this bill.

Without further pursuing the subject, I return the bill to the Senate without my signature,
and with the following as prominent objections to its becoming a law:

First. That it gives to the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company preemption
privileges to iron and coal lands on a large scale and at the ordinary minimum--a privilege
denied to ordinary preemptors. It bestows upon the company large tracts of coal lands at one-sixteenth
of the minimum price required from ordinary preemptors. It also relieves the company from restrictions
imposed upon ordinary preemptors in respect to timber lands; allows double the time for payment
granted to preemptors on offered lands; and these privileges are for purposes not heretofore
authorized by the preemption laws, but for trade and manufacturing.

Second. Preemption rights on such a scale to private corporations are unequal and hostile to
the policy and principles which sanction preemption laws.

Third. The bill allows this company to take possession of land, use it, and acquire a patent
thereto before the Indian title is extinguished, and thus violates the good faith of the Government
toward the aboriginal tribes.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 16, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

A careful examination of the bill passed by the two Houses of Congress entitled "An act to
continue in force and to amend 'An act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and
refugees, and for other purposes'" has convinced me that the legislation which it proposes
would not be consistent with the welfare of the country, and that it falls clearly within the
reasons assigned in my message of the 19th of February last, returning, without my signature,
a similar measure which originated in the Senate. It is not my purpose to repeat the objections
which I then urged. They are yet fresh in your recollection, and can be readily examined as
a part of the records of one branch of the National Legislature. Adhering to the principles
set forth in that message, I now reaffirm them and the line of policy therein indicated.

The only ground upon which this kind of legislation can be justified is that of the war-making
power. The act of which this bill is intended as amendatory was passed during the existence
of the war. By its own provisions it is to terminate within one year from the cessation of
hostilities and the declaration of peace. It is therefore yet in existence, and it is likely
that it will continue in force as long as the freedmen may require the benefit of its provisions.
It will certainly remain in operation as a law until some months subsequent to the meeting
of the next session of Congress, when, if experience shall make evident the necessity of additional
legislation, the two Houses will have ample time to mature and pass the requisite measures.
In the meantime the questions arise, Why should this war measure be continued beyond the period
designated in the original act, and why in time of peace should military tribunals be created
to continue until each "State shall be fully restored in its constitutional relations to the
Government and shall be duly represented in the Congress of the United States"?

It was manifest, with respect to the act approved March 3, 1865, that prudence and wisdom alike
required that jurisdiction over all cases concerning the free enjoyment of the immunities and
rights of citizenship, as well as the protection of person and property, should be conferred
upon some tribunal in every State or district where the ordinary course of judicial proceedings
was interrupted by the rebellion, and until the same should be fully restored. At that time,
therefore, an urgent necessity existed for the passage of some such law. Now, however, war
has substantially ceased; the ordinary course of judicial proceedings is no longer interrupted;
the courts, both State and Federal, are in full, complete, and successful operation, and through
them every person, regardless of race and color, is entitled to and can be heard. The protection
granted to the white citizen is already conferred by law upon the freedman; strong and stringent
guards, by way of penalties and punishments, are thrown around his person and property, and
it is believed that ample protection will be afforded him by due process of law, without resort
to the dangerous expedient of "military tribunals," now that the war has been brought to a
close. The necessity no longer existing for such tribunals, which had their origin in the war,
grave objections to their continuance must present themselves to the minds of all reflecting
and dispassionate men. Independently of the danger, in representative republics, of conferring
upon the military, in time of peace, extraordinary powers--so carefully guarded against by
the patriots and statesmen of the earlier days of the Republic, so frequently the ruin of governments
founded upon the same free principles, and subversive of the rights and liberties of the citizen--the
question of practical economy earnestly commends itself to the consideration of the lawmaking
power. With an immense debt already burdening the incomes of the industrial and laboring classes,
a due regard for their interests, so inseparably connected with the welfare of the country,
should prompt us to rigid economy and retrenchment, and influence us to abstain from all legislation
that would unnecessarily increase the public indebtedness. Tested by this rule of sound political
wisdom, I can see no reason for the establishment of the "military jurisdiction" conferred
upon the officials of the Bureau by the fourteenth section of the bill.

By the laws of the United States and of the different States competent courts, Federal and
State, have been established and are now in full practical operation. By means of these civil
tribunals ample redress is afforded for all private wrongs, whether to the person or the property
of the citizen, without denial or unnecessary delay. They are open to all, without regard to
color or race. I feel well assured that it will be better to trust the rights, privileges,
and immunities of the citizen to tribunals thus established, and presided over by competent
and impartial judges, bound by fixed rules of law and evidence, and where the right of trial
by jury is guaranteed and secured, than to the caprice or judgment of an officer of the Bureau,
who it is possible may be entirely ignorant of the principles that underlie the just administration
of the law. There is danger, too, that conflict of jurisdiction will frequently arise between
the civil courts and these military tribunals, each having concurrent jurisdiction over the
person and the cause of action--the one judicature administered and controlled by civil law,
the other by the military. How is the conflict to be settled, and who is to determine between
the two tribunals when it arises? In my opinion, it is wise to guard against such conflict
by leaving to the courts and juries the protection of all civil rights and the redress of all
civil grievances.

The fact can not be denied that since the actual cessation of hostilities many acts of violence,
such, perhaps, as had never been witnessed in their previous history, have occurred in the
States involved in the recent rebellion. I believe, however, that public sentiment will sustain
me in the assertion that such deeds of wrong are not confined to any particular State or section,
but are manifested over the entire country, demonstrating that the cause that produced them
does not depend upon any particular locality, but is the result of the agitation and derangement
incident to a long and bloody civil war. While the prevalence of such disorders must be greatly
deplored, their occasional and temporary occurrence would seem to furnish no necessity for
the extension of the Bureau beyond the period fixed in the original act.

Besides the objections which I have thus briefly stated, I may urge upon your consideration
the additional reason that recent developments in regard to the practical operations of the
Bureau in many of the States show that in numerous instances it is used by its agents as a
means of promoting their individual advantage, and that the freedmen are employed for the advancement
of the personal ends of the officers instead of their own improvement and welfare, thus confirming
the fears originally entertained by many that the continuation of such a Bureau for any unnecessary
length of time would inevitably result in fraud, corruption, and oppression. It is proper to
state that in cases of this character investigations have been promptly ordered, and the offender
punished whenever his guilt has been satisfactorily established.

As another reason against the necessity of the legislation contemplated by this measure, reference
may be had to the "civil-rights bill," now a law of the land, and which will be faithfully
executed so long as it shall remain unrepealed and may not be declared unconstitutional by
courts of competent jurisdiction. By that act it is enacted--

  That all persons born in the United States and not subject to any
  foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to
  be citizens of the United States; and such citizens, of every race
  and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery or
  involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the
  party shall have been duly convicted, shall have the same right in every
  State and Territory in the United States to make and enforce contracts;
  to sue, be parties, and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease,
  sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal
  benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and
  property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like
  punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute,
  ordinance, regulation, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.

By the provisions of the act full protection is afforded through the district courts of the
United States to all persons injured, and whose privileges, as thus declared, are in any way
impaired; and heavy penalties are denounced against the person who willfully violates the law.
I need not state that that law did not receive my approval; yet its remedies are far more preferable
than those proposed in the present bill--the one being civil and the other military.

By the sixth section of the bill herewith returned certain proceedings by which the lands in
the "parishes of St. Helena and St. Luke, South Carolina," were sold and bid in, and afterwards
disposed of by the tax commissioners, are ratified and confirmed. By the seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth, and eleventh sections provisions by law are made for the disposal of the lands thus
acquired to a particular class of citizens. As a general principle, such legislation is unsafe,
unwise, partial, and unconstitutional. It may deprive persons of their property who are equally
deserving objects of the nation's bounty as those whom by this legislation Congress seeks to
benefit. The title to the land thus to be portioned out to a favored class of citizens must
depend upon the regularity of the tax sales under the law as it existed at the time of the
sale, and no subsequent legislation can give validity to the right thus acquired as against
the original claimants. The attention of Congress is therefore invited to a more mature consideration
of the measures proposed in these sections of the bill.

In conclusion I again urge upon Congress the danger of class legislation, so well calculated
to keep the public mind in a state of uncertain expectation, disquiet, and restlessness and
to encourage interested hopes and fears that the National Government will continue to furnish
to classes of citizens in the several States means for support and maintenance regardless of
whether they pursue a life of indolence or of labor, and regardless also of the constitutional
limitations of the national authority in times of peace and tranquillity.

The bill is herewith returned to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, for
its final action.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 28, 1866.

To the House of Representatives:

I herewith return, without my approval, the bill entitled "An act erecting the Territory of
Montana into a surveying district, and for other purposes."

The bill contains four sections, the first of which erects the Territory into a surveying district
and authorizes the appointment of a surveyor-general; the second constitutes the Territory
a land district; the third authorizes the appointment of a register and receiver for said district;
and the fourth requires the surveyor-general to--

  select and survey eighteen alternate odd sections of nonmineral timber
  lands within said district for the New York and Montana Iron Mining and
  Manufacturing Company, incorporated under the laws of the State of New
  York, which lands the said company shall have immediate possession of on
  the payment of $1.25 per acre, and shall have a patent for the same
  whenever, within two years after their selection, they shall have
  furnished evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior that
  they have erected and have in operation on the said lands iron works
  with a capacity for manufacturing 1,500 tons of iron per annum:
  Provided, That the said lands shall revert to the United States in
  case the above-mentioned iron works be not erected within the specified
  time: And provided, That until the title to the said lands shall have
  been perfected the timber shall not be cut off from more than one
  section of the said lands.

To confer the special privileges specified in this fourth section appears to be the chief object
of the bill, the provisions of which are subject to some of the most important objections that
induced me to return to the Senate with my disapproval the bill entitled "An act to enable
the New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company to purchase a certain amount
of the public lands not now in market." That bill authorized the same corporation to select
and survey in the Territory of Montana, in square form, twenty-one sections of land, three
of which might contain coal and iron ore, for which the minimum rate of $1.25 per acre was
to be paid. The present bill omits these sections of mineral lands, and directs the surveyor-general
to select and survey the timber lands; but it contains the objectionable feature of granting
to a private mining and manufacturing corporation exclusive rights and privileges in the public
domain which are by law denied to individuals. The first choice of timber land in the Territory
is bestowed upon a corporation foreign to the Territory and over which Congress has no control.
The surveyor-general of the district, a public officer who should have no connection with any
purchase of public land, is made the agent of the corporation to select the land, the selections
to be made in the absence of all competition; and over 11,000 acres are bestowed at the lowest
price of public lands. It is by no means certain that the substitution of alternate sections
for the compact body of lands contemplated by the other bill is any less injurious to the public
interest, for alternate sections stripped of timber are not likely to enhance the value of
those reserved by the Government. Be this as it may, this bill bestows a large monopoly of
public lands without adequate consideration; confers a right and privilege in quantity equivalent
to seventy-two preemption rights; introduces a dangerous system of privileges to private trading
corporations; and is an unjust discrimination in favor of traders and speculators against individual
settlers and pioneers who are seeking homes and improving our Western Territories. Such a departure
from the long-established, wise, and just policy which has heretofore governed the disposition
of the public funds [lands] can not receive my sanction. The objections enumerated apply to
the fourth section of the bill. The first, second, and third sections, providing for the appointment
of a surveyor-general, register, and receiver, are unobjectionable if any necessity requires
the creation of these offices and the additional expenses of a new surveying land district.
But they appear in this instance to be only needed as a part of the machinery to enable the
"New York and Montana Iron Mining and Manufacturing Company" to secure these privileges; for
I am informed by the proper Department, in a communication hereto annexed, that there is no
public necessity for a surveyor-general, register, or receiver in Montana Territory, since
it forms part of an existing surveying and land district, wherein the public business is, under
present laws, transacted with adequate facility, so that the provisions of the first, second,
and third sections would occasion needless expense to the General Government.

And whereas these resolutions, though not joint or concurrent in form, are substantially identical,
and as such may be regarded as having expressed the sense of Congress upon the subject to which
they relate; and

Whereas by my proclamation of the 13th day of June last the insurrection in the State of Tennessee
was declared to have been suppressed, the authority of the United States therein to be undisputed,
and such United States officers as had been duly commissioned to be in the undisturbed exercise
of their official functions; and

Whereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided citizens or others to the
authority of the United States in the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida, and the laws can be sustained
and enforced therein by the proper civil authority, State or Federal, and the people of said
States are well and loyally disposed and have conformed or will conform in their legislation
to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the Constitution of the United
States prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States; and

Whereas, in view of the before-recited premises, it is the manifest determination of the American
people that no State of its own will has the right or the power to go out of, or separate itself
from, or be separated from, the American Union, and that therefore each State ought to remain
and constitute an integral part of the United States; and

Whereas the people of the several before-mentioned States have, in the manner aforesaid, given
satisfactory evidence that they acquiesce in this sovereign and important resolution of national
unity; and

Whereas it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that people who have revolted
and who have been overcome and subdued must either be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily
to become friends or else they must be held by absolute military power or devastated so as
to prevent them from ever again doing harm as enemies, which last-named policy is abhorrent
to humanity and to freedom; and

Whereas the Constitution of the United States provides for constituent communities only as
States, and not as Territories, dependencies, provinces, or protectorates; and

Whereas such constituent States must necessarily be, and by the Constitution and laws of the
United States are, made equals and placed upon a like footing as to political rights, immunities,
dignity, and power with the several States with which they are united; and

Whereas the observance of political equality, as a principle of right and justice, is well
calculated to encourage the people of the aforesaid States to be and become more and more constant
and persevering in their renewed allegiance; and

Whereas standing armies, military occupation, martial law, military tribunals, and the suspension
of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus are in time of peace dangerous to public liberty,
incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of
our free institutions, and exhaustive of the national resources, and ought not, therefore,
to be sanctioned or allowed except in cases of actual necessity for repelling invasion or suppressing
insurrection or rebellion; and

Whereas the policy of the Government of the United States from the beginning of the insurrection
to its overthrow and final suppression has been in conformity with the principles herein set
forth and enumerated:

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare
that the insurrection which heretofore existed in the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia,
North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida is at an
end and is henceforth to be so regarded.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

By the President:
  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
    Secretary of State.

ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

To all whom it may concern:

Whereas the exequatur of Claudius Edward Habicht, recognizing him as consul of Sweden and Norway
at New York, and that of S.M. Svenson as vice-consul of Sweden and Norway at New Orleans were
formally revoked on the 26th day of March last; and

Whereas representations have been made to me since that date which have effectually relieved
those gentlemen from the charges of unlawful and unfriendly conduct heretofore entertained
against them:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States of America,
do hereby annul the revocation of the exequaturs of the said Claudius Edward Habicht and S.M.
Svenson and restore to them the right to exercise the functions and privileges heretofore granted
as consular officers of the Government of Sweden and Norway.

A PROCLAMATION.

And, pursuant to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, I do furthermore authorize
and empower Major-General George G. Meade, commander of the Military Division of the Atlantic,
to employ the land and naval forces of the United States and the militia thereof to arrest
and prevent the setting on foot and carrying on the expedition and enterprise aforesaid.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

By the President:

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas a war is existing in the Republic of Mexico, aggravated by foreign military intervention;
and

Whereas the United States, in accordance with their settled habits and policy, are a neutral
power in regard to the war which thus afflicts the Republic of Mexico; and

Whereas it has become known that one of the belligerents in the said war, namely, the Prince
Maximilian, who asserts himself to be Emperor in Mexico, has issued a decree in regard to the
port of Matamoras and other Mexican ports which are in the occupation and possession of another
of the said belligerents, namely, the United States of Mexico, which decree is in the following
words:

  The port of Matamoras and all those of the northern frontier which have
  withdrawn from their obedience to the Government are closed to foreign
  and coasting traffic during such time as the empire of the law shall not
  be therein reinstated.

  ART. 2. Merchandise proceeding from the said ports, on arriving at any
  other where the excise of the Empire is collected, shall pay the duties
  on importation, introduction, and consumption, and, on satisfactory
  proof of contravention, shall be irremissibly confiscated. Our minister
  of the treasury is charged with the punctual execution of this decree.

  Given at Mexico, the 9th of July, 1866.

And whereas the decree thus recited, by declaring a belligerent blockade unsupported by competent
military or naval force, is in violation of the neutral rights of the United States as defined
by the law of nations as well as of the treaties existing between the United States of America
and the aforesaid United States of Mexico:

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare
that the aforesaid decree is held and will be held by the United States to be absolutely null
and void as against the Government and citizens of the United States, and that any attempt
which shall be made to enforce the same against the Government or the citizens of the United
States will be disallowed.

A PROCLAMATION.

And whereas these resolutions, though not joint or concurrent in form, are substantially identical,
and as such have hitherto been and yet are regarded as having expressed the sense of Congress
upon the subject to which they relate; and

Whereas the President of the United States, by proclamation of the 13th of June, 1865, declared
that the insurrection in the State of Tennessee had been suppressed, and that the authority
of the United States therein was undisputed, and that such United States officers as had been
duly commissioned were in the undisturbed exercise of their official functions; and

Whereas the President of the United States, by further proclamation, issued on the 2d day of
April, 1866, did promulgate and declare that there no longer existed any armed resistance of
misguided citizens or others to the authority of the United States in any or in all the States
before mentioned, excepting only the State of Texas, and did further promulgate and declare
that the laws could be sustained and enforced in the several States before mentioned, except
Texas, by the proper civil authorities, State or Federal, and that the people of the said States,
except Texas, are well and loyally disposed and have conformed or will conform in their legislation
to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the Constitution of the United
States prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States;

And did further declare in the same proclamation that it is the manifest determination of the
American people that no State, of its own will, has a right or power to go out of, or separate
itself from, or be separated from, the American Union; and that, therefore, each State ought
to remain and constitute an integral part of the United States;

And did further declare in the same last-mentioned proclamation that the several aforementioned
States, excepting Texas, had in the manner aforesaid given satisfactory evidence that they
acquiesce in this sovereign and important resolution of national unity; and

Whereas the President of the United States in the same proclamation did further declare that
it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that the people who have revolted
and who have been overcome and subdued must either be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily
to become friends or else they must be held by absolute military power or devastated so as
to prevent them from ever again doing harm as enemies, which last-named policy is abhorrent
to humanity and to freedom; and

Whereas the President did in the same proclamation further declare that the Constitution of
the United States provides for constituent communities only as States, and not as Territories,
dependencies, provinces, or protectorates;

And further, that such constituent States must necessarily be, and by the Constitution and
laws of the United States are, made equals and placed upon a like footing as to political rights,
immunities, dignity, and power with the several States with which they are united;

And did further declare that the observance of political equality, as a principle of right
and justice, is well calculated to encourage the people of the before named States, except
Texas, to be and to become more and more constant and persevering in their renewed allegiance; and

Whereas the President did further declare that standing armies, military occupation, martial
law, military tribunals, and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus are in time of peace
dangerous to public liberty, incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen, contrary
to the genius and spirit of our free institutions, and exhaustive of the national resources,
and ought not, therefore, to be sanctioned or allowed except in cases of actual necessity for
repelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion;

And the President did further, in the same proclamation, declare that the policy of the Government
of the United States from the beginning of the insurrection to its overthrow and final suppression
had been conducted in conformity with the principles in the last-named proclamation recited; and

Whereas the President, in the said proclamation of the 13th of June, 1865, upon the grounds
therein stated and hereinbefore recited, did then and thereby proclaim and declare that the
insurrection which heretofore existed in the several States before named, except in Texas,
was at an end and was henceforth to be so regarded; and

Whereas subsequently to the said 2d day of April, 1866, the insurrection in the State of Texas
has been completely and everywhere suppressed and ended and the authority of the United States
has been successfully and completely established in the said State of Texas and now remains
therein unresisted and undisputed, and such of the proper United States officers as have been
duly commissioned within the limits of the said State are now in the undisturbed exercise of
their official functions; and

Whereas the laws can now be sustained and enforced in the said State of Texas by the proper
civil authority, State or Federal, and the people of the said State of Texas, like the people
of the other States before named, are well and loyally disposed and have conformed or will
conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment of the
Constitution of the United States prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of
the United States; and

Whereas all the reasons and conclusions set forth in regard to the several States therein specially
named now apply equally and in all respects to the State of Texas, as well as to the other
States which had been involved in insurrection; and

Whereas adequate provision has been made by military orders to enforce the execution of the
acts of Congress, aid the civil authorities, and secure obedience to the Constitution and laws
of the United States within the State of Texas if a resort to military force for such purpose
should at any time become necessary:

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare
that the insurrection which heretofore existed in the State of Texas is at an end and is to
be henceforth so regarded in that State as in the other States before named in which the said
insurrection was proclaimed to be at an end by the aforesaid proclamation of the 2d day of
April, 1866.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

By the President:
  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
    Secretary of State.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

A PROCLAMATION.

Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, has been pleased to vouchsafe to us as a people another
year of that national life which is an indispensable condition of peace, security, and progress.
That year has, moreover, been crowned with many peculiar blessings.

The civil war that so recently closed among us has not been anywhere reopened; foreign intervention
has ceased to excite alarm or apprehension; intrusive pestilence has been benignly mitigated;
domestic tranquillity has improved, sentiments of conciliation have largely prevailed, and
affections of loyalty and patriotism have been widely renewed; our fields have yielded quite
abundantly, our mining industry has been richly rewarded, and we have been allowed to extend
our railroad system far into the interior recesses of the country, while our commerce has resumed
its customary activity in foreign seas.

These great national blessings demand a national acknowledgment.

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Johnson. President of the United States, do hereby recommend that
Thursday, the 29th day of November next, be set apart and be observed everywhere in the several
States and Territories of the United States by the people thereof as a day of thanksgiving
and praise to Almighty God, with due remembrance that "in His temple doth every man speak of
His honor." I recommend also that on the same solemn occasion they do humbly and devoutly implore
Him to grant to our national councils and to our whole people that divine wisdom which alone
can lead any nation into the ways of all good.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
    Secretary of State.

EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

[From the Daily National Intelligencer, April 9, 1866.]

EXECUTIVE MANSION, April 7, 1866.

It is eminently right and proper that the Government of the United States should give earnest
and substantial evidence of its just appreciation of the services of the patriotic men who
when the life of the nation was imperiled entered the Army and Navy to preserve the integrity
of the Union, defend the Government, and maintain and perpetuate unimpaired its free institutions.

It is therefore directed--

First. That in appointments to office in the several Executive Departments of the General Government
and the various branches of the public service connected with said Departments preference shall
be given to such meritorious and honorably discharged soldiers and sailors--particularly those
who have been disabled by wounds received or diseases contracted in the line of duty--as may
possess the proper qualifications.

Second. That in all promotions in said Departments and the several branches of the public service
connected therewith such persons shall have preference, when equally eligible and qualified,
over those who have not faithfully and honorably served in the land or naval forces of the
United States.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, April 13, 1866.

On the 14th of April, 1865, great affliction was brought upon the American people by the assassination
of the lamented Abraham Lincoln, then President of the United States. The undersigned is therefore
directed by the President to announce that in commemoration of that event the public offices
will be closed to-morrow, the 14th instant.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

GENERAL ORDERS, No. 26.

WAR DEPARTMENT,
  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE.
    Washington, May 1, 1866.

ORDER IN RELATION TO TRIALS BY MILITARY COURTS AND COMMISSIONS.

Whereas some military commanders are embarrassed by doubts as to the operation of the proclamation
of the President dated the 2d day of April, 1866, upon trials by military courts-martial and
military officers; to remove such doubts--

It is ordered by the President, That hereafter, whenever offenses committed by civilians are
to be tried where civil tribunals are in existence which can try them, their cases are not
authorized to be, and will not be, brought before military courts-martial or commissions, but
will be committed to the proper civil authorities. This order is not applicable to camp followers,
as provided for under the sixtieth article of war, or to contractors and others specified in
section 16, act of July 17, 1862, and sections 1 and 2, act of March 2, 1863. Persons and offenses
cognizable by the Rules and Articles of War and by the acts of Congress above cited will continue
to be tried and punished by military tribunals as prescribed by the Rules and Articles of War
and acts of Congress hereinafter cited, to wit:

  [Sixtieth of the Rules and Articles of War.]

  60. All sutlers and retainers to the camp, and all persons whatsoever
  serving with the armies of the United States in the field, though not
  enlisted soldiers, are to be subject to orders, according to the rules
  and discipline of war.

  [Extract from "An act to define the pay and emoluments of certain
  officers of the Army, and for other purposes," approved July 17, 1862.]

  SEC. 16. And be it further enacted, That whenever any contractor for
  subsistence, clothing, arms, ammunition, munitions of war, and for every
  description of supplies for the Army or Navy of the United States, shall
  be found guilty by a court-martial of fraud or willful neglect of duty,
  he shall be punished by fine, imprisonment, or such other punishment as
  the court-martial shall adjudge; and any person who shall contract to
  furnish supplies of any kind or description for the Army or Navy, he
  shall be deemed and taken as a part of the land or naval forces of the
  United States for which he shall contract to furnish said supplies, and
  be subject to the rules and regulations for the government of the land
  and naval forces of the United States. And every person so offending may be arrested
  and held for trial by a court-martial, and if found guilty shall be
  punished by fine and imprisonment, or such other punishment as the
  court-martial may adjudge, save the punishment of death.

  SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That any person heretofore called
  or hereafter to be called into or employed in such forces or service who
  shall commit any violation of this act, and shall afterwards receive his
  discharge or be dismissed from the service, shall, notwithstanding such
  discharge or dismissal, continue to be liable to be arrested and held
  for trial and sentence by a court-martial in the same manner and to the
  same extent as if he had not received such discharge or been dismissed.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E.D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, May 29, 1866.

The President with profound sorrow announces to the people of the United States the death of
Winfield Scott, the late Lieutenant-General of the Army. On the day which may be appointed
for his funeral the several Executive Departments of the Government will be closed.

The heads of the War and Navy Departments will respectively give orders for paying appropriate
honors to the memory of the deceased.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

[From the Daily National Intelligencer, June 6, 1866.]

ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D.C., June 5, 1866.

By direction of the President, you[7] are hereby instructed to cause the arrest of all prominent,
leading, or conspicuous persons called "Fenians" who you may have probable cause to believe
have been or may be guilty of violations of the neutrality laws of the United States.

JAMES SPEED,

Attorney-General.

[Footnote 7: Addressed to district attorneys and marshals of the United States.]

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, June 18, 1866.

The President directs the undersigned to perform the painful duty of announcing to the people
of the United States that Lewis Cass, distinguished not more by faithful service in varied
public trusts than by exalted patriotism at a recent period of political disorder, departed
this life at 4 o'clock yesterday morning. The several Executive Departments of the Government
will cause appropriate honors to be rendered to the memory of the deceased at home and abroad
wherever the national name and authority are acknowledged.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, D.C., October 26, 1866.

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SIR: Recent advices indicate an early evacuation of Mexico by the French expeditionary forces
and that the time has arrived when our minister to Mexico should place himself in communication
with that Republic.

In furtherance of the objects of his mission and as evidence of the earnest desire felt by
the United States for the proper adjustment of the questions involved, I deem it of great importance
that General Grant should by his presence and advice cooperate with our minister.

I have therefore to ask that you will request General Grant to proceed to some point on our
Mexican frontier most suitable and convenient for communication with our minister, or (if General
Grant deems it best) to accompany him to his destination in Mexico, and to give him the aid
of his advice in carrying out the instructions of the Secretary of State, a copy of which is
herewith sent for the General's information.

General Grant will make report to the Secretary of War of such matters as, in his discretion,
ought to be communicated to the Department.

Very respectfully, yours,

ANDREW JOHNSON.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, D.C., October 30, 1866.

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SIR: General Ulysses S. Grant having found it inconvenient to assume the duties specified in
my letter to you of the 26th instant, you will please relieve him from the same and assign
them in all respects to William T. Sherman, Lieutenant-General of the Army of the United States.
By way of guiding General Sherman in the performance of his duties, you will furnish him with
a copy of your special orders to General Grant, made in compliance with my letter of the 26th
instant, together with a copy of the instructions of the Secretary of State to Lewis D. Campbell,
esq., therein mentioned. The Lieutenant-General will proceed to the execution of his duties
without delay.

Very respectfully, yours,

ANDREW JOHNSON.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, D.C., November 1, 1866.

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SIR: In the report of General Grant of the 27th ultimo, inclosed in your communication of that
date, reference is made to the force at present stationed in the Military Department of Washington
(which embraces the District of Columbia, the counties of Alexander and Fairfax, Va., and the
States of Maryland and Delaware), and it is stated that the entire number of troops comprised
in the command is 2,224, of which only 1,550 are enumerated as "effective." In view of the
prevalence in various portions of the country of a revolutionary and turbulent disposition,
which might at any moment assume insurrectionary proportions and lead to serious disorders,
and of the duty of the Government to be at all times prepared to act with decision and effect,
this force is not deemed adequate for the protection and security of the seat of Government.

I therefore request that you will at once take such measures as will insure its safety, and
thus discourage any attempt for its possession by insurgent or other illegal combinations.

Very respectfully, yours,

ANDREW JOHNSON.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, D.C., November 2, 1866.

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SIR: There is ground to apprehend danger of an insurrection in Baltimore against the constituted
authorities of the State of Maryland on or about the day of the election soon to be held in
that city, and that in such contingency the aid of the United States might be invoked under
the acts of Congress which pertain to that subject. While I am averse to any military demonstration
that would have a tendency to interfere with the free exercise of the elective franchise in
Baltimore or be construed into any interference in local questions, I feel great solicitude
that should an insurrection take place the Government should be prepared to meet and promptly
put it down. I accordingly desire you to call General Grant's attention to the subject, leaving
to his own discretion and judgment the measures of preparation and precaution that should be
adopted.

Very respectfully, yours,

ANDREW JOHNSON.

SECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.

time failed to answer, as to whether any application has been made to him for the pardon of
G.E. Pickett, who acted as a major-general of the rebel forces in the late war for the suppression
of insurrection, and, if so, what has been the action thereon; and also to communicate copies
of all papers, entries, indorsements, and other documentary evidence in relation to any proceeding
in connection with such application; and that he also inform this House whether, since the
adjournment at Raleigh, N.C., on the 30th of March last, of the last board or court of inquiry

are out of place in an appropriation act. I am compelled to defeat these necessary appropriations
if I withhold my signature to the act. Pressed by these considerations, I feel constrained
to return the bill with my signature, but to accompany it with my protest against the sections
which I have indicated.

VETO MESSAGES.

WASHINGTON, January 5, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have received and considered a bill entitled "An act to regulate the elective franchise in
the District of Columbia," passed by the Senate on the 13th of December and by the House of
Representatives on the succeeding day. It was presented for my approval on the 26th ultimo--six
days after the adjournment of Congress--and is now returned with my objections to the Senate,
in which House it originated.

Measures having been introduced at the commencement of the first session of the present Congress
for the extension of the elective franchise to persons of color in the District of Columbia,
steps were taken by the corporate authorities of Washington and Georgetown to ascertain and
make known the opinion of the people of the two cities upon a subject so immediately affecting
their welfare as a community. The question was submitted to the people at special elections
held in the month of December, 1865, when the qualified voters of Washington and Georgetown,
with great unanimity of sentiment, expressed themselves opposed to the contemplated legislation.
In Washington, in a vote of 6,556--the largest, with but two exceptions, ever polled in that
city--only thirty-five ballots were cast for negro suffrage, while in Georgetown, in an aggregate
of 813 votes--a number considerably in excess of the average vote at the four preceding annual
elections--but one was given in favor of the proposed extension of the elective franchise.
As these elections seem to have been conducted with entire fairness, the result must be accepted
as a truthful expression of the opinion of the people of the District upon the question which
evoked it. Possessing, as an organized community, the same popular right as the inhabitants
of a State or Territory to make known their will upon matters which affect their social and
political condition, they could have selected no more appropriate mode of memorializing Congress
upon the subject of this bill than through the suffrages of their qualified voters.

Entirely disregarding the wishes of the people of the District of Columbia, Congress has deemed
it right and expedient to pass the measure now submitted for my signature. It therefore becomes
the duty of the Executive, standing between the legislation of the one and the will of the
other, fairly expressed, to determine whether he should approve the bill, and thus aid in placing
upon the statute books of the nation a law against which the people to whom it is to apply
have solemnly and with such unanimity protested, or whether he should return it with his objections
in the hope that upon reconsideration Congress, acting as the representatives of the inhabitants
of the seat of Government, will permit them to regulate a purely local question as to them
may seem best suited to their interests and condition.

The District of Columbia was ceded to the United States by Maryland and Virginia in order that
it might become the permanent seat of Government of the United States. Accepted by Congress,
it at once became subject to the "exclusive legislation" for which provision is made in the
Federal Constitution. It should be borne in mind, however, that in exercising its functions
as the lawmaking power of the District of Columbia the authority of the National Legislature
is not without limit, but that Congress is bound to observe the letter and spirit of the Constitution
as well in the enactment of local laws for the seat of Government as in legislation common
to the entire Union. Despotism would thus reign at the seat of government of a free republic,
and as a place of permanent residence it would be avoided by all who prefer the blessings of
liberty to the mere emoluments of official position.

It should also be remembered that in legislating for the District of Columbia under the Federal
Constitution the relation of Congress to its inhabitants is analogous to that of a legislature
to the people of a State under their own local constitution. It does not, therefore, seem to
be asking too much that in matters pertaining to the District Congress should have a like respect
for the will and interest of its inhabitants as is entertained by a State legislature for the
wishes and prosperity of those for whom they legislate. The spirit of our Constitution and
the genius of our Government require that in regard to any law which is to affect and have
a permanent bearing upon a people their will should exert at least a reasonable influence upon
those who are acting in the capacity of their legislators. Would, for instance, the legislature
of the State of New York, or of Pennsylvania, or of Indiana, or of any State in the Union,
in opposition to the expressed will of a large majority of the people whom they were chosen
to represent, arbitrarily force upon them as voters all persons of the African or negro race
and make them eligible for office without any other qualification than a certain term of residence
within the State? In neither of the States named would the colored population, when acting
together, be able to produce any great social or political result. Yet in New York, before
he can vote, the man of color must fulfill conditions that are not required of the white citizen;
in Pennsylvania the elective franchise is restricted to white freemen, while in Indiana negroes
and mulattoes are expressly excluded from the right of suffrage. It hardly seems consistent
with the principles of right and justice that representatives of States where suffrage is either
denied the colored man or granted to him on qualifications requiring intelligence or property
should compel the people of the District of Columbia to try an experiment which their own constituents
have thus far shown an unwillingness to test for themselves. Nor does it accord with our republican
ideas that the principle of self-government should lose its force when applied to the residents
of the District merely because their legislators are not, like those of the States, responsible
through the ballot to the people for whom they are the lawmaking power.

The great object of placing the seat of Government under the exclusive legislation of Congress
was to secure the entire independence of the General Government from undue State influence
and to enable it to discharge without danger of interruption or infringement of its authority
the high functions for which it was created by the people. For this important purpose it was
ceded to the United States by Maryland and Virginia, and it certainly never could have been
contemplated as one of the objects to be attained by placing it under the exclusive jurisdiction
of Congress that it would afford to propagandists or political parties a place for an experimental
test of their principles and theories. While, indeed, the residents of the seat of Government
are not citizens of any State and are not, therefore, allowed a voice in the electoral college
or representation in the councils of the nation, they are, nevertheless, American citizens,
entitled as such to every guaranty of the Constitution, to every benefit of the laws, and to
every right which pertains to citizens of our common country. In all matters, then, affecting
their domestic affairs, the spirit of our democratic form of government demands that their
wishes should be consulted and respected and they taught to feel that although not permitted
practically to participate in national concerns, they are, nevertheless, under a paternal government
regardful of their rights, mindful of their wants, and solicitous for their prosperity. It
was evidently contemplated that all local questions would be left to their decision, at least
to an extent that would not be incompatible with the object for which Congress was granted
exclusive legislation over the seat of Government. When the Constitution was yet under consideration,
it was assumed by Mr. Madison that its inhabitants would be allowed "a municipal legislature
for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages." Three years had not elapsed when Congress
was called upon to determine the propriety of retroceding to Maryland and Virginia the jurisdiction
of the territory which they had respectively relinquished to the Government of the United States.
It was urged on the one hand that exclusive jurisdiction was not necessary or useful to the
Government; that it deprived the inhabitants of the District of their political rights; that
much of the time of Congress was consumed in legislation pertaining to it; that its government
was expensive; that Congress was not competent to legislate for the District, because the members
were strangers to its local concerns; and that it was an example of a government without representation--an
experiment dangerous to the liberties of the States. On the other hand it was held, among other
reasons, and successfully, that the Constitution, the acts of cession of Virginia and Maryland,
and the act of Congress accepting the grant all contemplated the exercise of exclusive legislation
by Congress, and that its usefulness, if not its necessity, was inferred from the inconvenience
which was felt for want of it by the Congress of the Confederation; that the people themselves,
who, it was said, had been deprived of their political rights, had not complained and did not
desire a retrocession; that the evil might be remedied by giving them a representation in Congress
when the District should become sufficiently populous, and in the meantime a local legislature;
that if the inhabitants had not political rights they had great political influence; that the
trouble and expense of legislating for the District would not be great, but would diminish,
and might in a great measure be avoided by a local legislature; and that Congress could not
retrocede the inhabitants without their consent. Continuing to live substantially under the
laws that existed at the time of the cession, and such changes only having been made as were
suggested by themselves, the people of the District have not sought by a local legislature
that which has generally been willingly conceded by the Congress of the nation.

As a general rule sound policy requires that the legislature should yield to the wishes of
a people, when not inconsistent with the constitution and the laws. The measures suited to
one community might not be well adapted to the condition of another; and the persons best qualified
to determine such questions are those whose interests are to be directly affected by any proposed
law. In Massachusetts, for instance, male persons are allowed to vote without regard to color,
provided they possess a certain degree of intelligence. In a population in that State of 1,231,066
there were, by the census of 1860, only 9,602 persons of color, and of the males over 20 years
of age there were 339,086 white to 2,602 colored. By the same official enumeration there were
in the District of Columbia 60,764 whites to 14,316 persons of the colored race. Since then,
however, the population of the District has largely increased, and it is estimated that at
the present time there are nearly 100,000 whites to 30,000 negroes. The cause of the augmented
numbers of the latter class needs no explanation. Contiguous to Maryland and Virginia, the
District during the war became a place of refuge for those who escaped from servitude, and
it is yet the abiding place of a considerable proportion of those who sought within its limits
a shelter from bondage. Until then held in slavery and denied all opportunities for mental
culture, their first knowledge of the Government was acquired when, by conferring upon them
freedom, it became the benefactor of their race. The test of their capability for improvement
began when for the first time the career of free industry and the avenues to intelligence were
opened to them. Possessing these advantages but a limited time--the greater number perhaps
having entered the District of Columbia during the later years of the war, or since its termination--we
may well pause to inquire whether, after so brief a probation, they are as a class capable
of an intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage and qualified to discharge the duties of
official position. The people who are daily witnesses of their mode of living, and who have
become familiar with their habits of thought, have expressed the conviction that they are not
yet competent to serve as electors, and thus become eligible for office in the local governments
under which they live. Clothed with the elective franchise, their numbers, already largely
in excess of the demand for labor, would be soon increased by an influx from the adjoining
States. Drawn from fields where employment is abundant, they would in vain seek it here, and
so add to the embarrassments already experienced from the large class of idle persons congregated
in the District. Hardly yet capable of forming correct judgments upon the important questions
that often make the issues of a political contest, they could readily be made subservient to
the purposes of designing persons. While in Massachusetts, under the census of 1860, the proportion
of white to colored males over 20 years of age was 130 to 1, here the black race constitutes
nearly one-third of the entire population, whilst the same class surrounds the District on
all sides, ready to change their residence at a moment's notice, and with all the facility
of a nomadic people, in order to enjoy here, after a short residence, a privilege they find
nowhere else. It is within their power in one year to come into the District in such numbers
as to have the supreme control of the white race, and to govern them by their own officers
and by the exercise of all the municipal authority--among the rest, of the power of taxation
over property in which they have no interest. In Massachusetts, where they have enjoyed the
benefits of a thorough educational system, a qualification of intelligence is required, while
here suffrage is extended to all without discrimination--as well to the most incapable who
can prove a residence in the District of one year as to those persons of color who, comparatively
few in number, are permanent inhabitants, and, having given evidence of merit and qualification,
are recognized as useful and responsible members of the community. Imposed upon an unwilling
people placed by the Constitution under the exclusive legislation of Congress, it would be
viewed as an arbitrary exercise of power and as an indication by the country of the purpose
of Congress to compel the acceptance of negro suffrage by the States. It would engender a feeling
of opposition and hatred between the two races, which, becoming deep rooted and ineradicable,
would prevent them from living together in a state of mutual friendliness. Carefully avoiding
every measure that might tend to produce such a result, and following the clear and well-ascertained
popular will, we should assiduously endeavor to promote kindly relations between them, and
thus, when that popular will leads the way, prepare for the gradual and harmonious introduction
of this new element into the political power of the country.

It can not be urged that the proposed extension of suffrage in the District of Columbia is
necessary to enable persons of color to protect either their interests or their rights. They
stand here precisely as they stand in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Here as elsewhere, in
all that pertains to civil rights, there is nothing to distinguish this class of persons from
citizens of the United States, for they possess the "full and equal benefit of all laws and
proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens," and are
made "subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute,
ordinance, regulation, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding." Nor, as has been assumed,
are their suffrages necessary to aid a loyal sentiment here, for local governments already
exist of undoubted fealty to the Government, and are sustained by communities which were among
the first to testify their devotion to the Union, and which during the struggle furnished their
full quotas of men to the military service of the country.

In returning this bill to the Senate I deeply regret that there should be any conflict of opinion
between the legislative and executive departments of the Government in regard to measures that
vitally affect the prosperity and peace of the country. Sincerely desiring to reconcile the
States with one another and the whole people to the Government of the United States, it has
been my earnest wish to cooperate with Congress in all measures having for their object a proper
and complete adjustment of the questions resulting from our late civil war. Harmony between
the coordinate branches of the Government, always necessary for the public welfare, was never
more demanded than at the present time, and it will therefore be my constant aim to promote
as far as possible concert of action between them. The differences of opinion that have already
occurred have rendered me only the more cautious, lest the Executive should encroach upon any
of the prerogatives of Congress, or by exceeding in any manner the constitutional limit of
his duties destroy the equilibrium which should exist between the several coordinate departments,
and which is so essential to the harmonious working of the Government. I know it has been urged
that the executive department is more likely to enlarge the sphere of its action than either
of the other two branches of the Government, and especially in the exercise of the veto power
conferred upon it by the Constitution. It should be remembered, however, that this power is
wholly negative and conservative in its character, and was intended to operate as a check upon
unconstitutional, hasty, and improvident legislation and as a means of protection against invasions
of the just powers of the executive and judicial departments. It is remarked by Chancellor
Kent that--

  To enact laws is a transcendent power, and if the body that possesses
  it be a full and equal representation of the people there is danger of
  its pressing with destructive weight upon all the other parts of the
  machinery of Government. It has therefore been thought necessary by the
  most skillful and most experienced artists in the science of civil
  polity that strong barriers should be erected for the protection and
  security of the other necessary powers of the Government. Nothing has
  been deemed more fit and expedient for the purpose than the provision
  that the head of the executive department should be so constituted as
  to secure a requisite share of independence and that he should have a
  negative upon the passing of laws; and that the judiciary power, resting
  on a still more permanent basis, should have the right of determining
  upon the validity of laws by the standard of the Constitution.

The necessity of some such check in the hands of the Executive is shown by reference to the
most eminent writers upon our system of government, who seem to concur in the opinion that
encroachments are most to be apprehended from the department in which all legislative powers
are vested by the Constitution. Mr. Madison, in referring to the difficulty of providing some
practical security for each against the invasion of the others, remarks that "the legislative
department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its
impetuous vortex." "The founders of our Republic * * * seem never to have recollected the danger
from legislative usurpations, which by assembling all power in the same hands must lead to
the same tyranny as is threatened by Executive usurpations." "In a representative republic,
where the executive magistracy is carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of
its power, and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly which is inspired, by
a supposed influence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength, which
is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous
as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions by means which reason prescribes,
it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge
all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions." "The legislative department derives
a superiority in our governments from other circumstances. Its constitutional powers being
at once more extensive and less susceptible of precise limits, it can with the greater facility
mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the encroachments which it makes on the coordinate
departments." "On the other side, the Executive power being restrained within a narrower compass
and being more simple in its nature, and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less
uncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these departments would immediately betray and
defeat themselves. Nor is this all. As the legislative department alone has access to the pockets
of the people and has in some constitutions full discretion and in all a prevailing influence
over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created
in the latter which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former." "We have
seen that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative
at the expense of the other departments."

Mr. Jefferson, in referring to the early constitution of Virginia, objected that by its provisions
all the powers of government--legislative, executive, and judicial--resulted to the legislative
body, holding that "the concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of
despotic government. It will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality
of hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would surely be as
oppressive as one." "As little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves. An elective
despotism was not the government we fought for, but one which should not only be founded on
free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among
several bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits without being
effectually checked and restrained by the others. For this reason that convention which passed
the ordinance of government laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative, executive,
and judicial departments should be separate and distinct, so that no person should exercise
the powers of more than one of them at the same time. But no barrier was provided between these
several powers. The judiciary and executive members were left dependent on the legislative
for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their continuance in it. If, therefore,
the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made,
nor, if made, can be effectual, because in that case they may put their proceedings into the
form of an act of assembly, which will render them obligatory on the other branches. They have
accordingly in many instances decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy;
and the direction of the executive, during the whole time of their session, is becoming habitual
and familiar."

Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution, reviews the same subject, and says:

  The truth is that the legislative power is the great and overruling
  power in every free government. * * * The representatives of the people
  will watch with jealousy every encroachment of the executive magistrate,
  for it trenches upon their own authority. But who shall watch the
  encroachment of these representatives themselves? Will they be as
  jealous of the exercise of power by themselves as by others? * * *

  There are many reasons which may be assigned for the engrossing
  influence of the legislative department. In the first place, its
  constitutional powers are more extensive, and less capable of being
  brought within precise limits than those of either the other
  departments. The bounds of the executive authority are easily marked
  out and defined. It reaches few objects, and those are known. It can
  not transcend them without being brought in contact with the other
  departments. Laws may check and restrain and bound its exercise. The
  same remarks apply with still greater force to the judiciary. The
  jurisdiction is, or may be, bounded to a few objects or persons; or,
  however general and unlimited, its operations are necessarily confined
  to the mere administration of private and public justice. It can not
  punish without law. It can not create controversies to act upon. It can
  decide only upon rights and cases as they are brought by others before
  it. It can do nothing for itself. It must do everything for others. It
  must obey the laws, and if it corruptly administers them it is subjected
  to the power of impeachment. On the other hand, the legislative power
  except in the few cases of constitutional prohibition, is unlimited. It
  is forever varying its means and its ends. It governs the institutions
  and laws and public policy of the country. It regulates all its vast
  interests. It disposes of all its property. Look but at the exercise
  of two or three branches of its ordinary powers. It levies all taxes;
  it directs and appropriates all supplies; it gives the rules for the
  descent, distribution, and devises of all property held by individuals;
  it controls the sources and the resources of wealth; it changes at its
  will the whole fabric of the laws; it molds at its pleasure almost all
  the institutions which give strength and comfort and dignity to society.

  In the next place, it is the direct visible representative of the will
  of the people in all the changes of times and circumstances. It has the
  pride as well as the power of numbers. It is easily moved and steadily
  moved by the strong impulses of popular feeling and popular odium. It
  obeys without reluctance the wishes and the will of the majority for the
  time being. The path to public favor lies open by such obedience, and it
  finds not only support but impunity in whatever measures the majority
  advises, even though they transcend the constitutional limits. It has no
  motive, therefore, to be jealous or scrupulous in its own use of power;
  and it finds its ambition stimulated and its arm strengthened by the
  countenance and the courage of numbers. These views are not alone those
  of men who look with apprehension upon the fate of republics, but they
  are also freely admitted by some of the strongest advocates for popular
  rights and the permanency of republican institutions. * * *

         *       *       *       *       *

  * * * Each department should have a will of its own. * * * Each should
  have its own independence secured beyond the power of being taken away
  by either or both of the others. But at the same time the relations of
  each to the other should be so strong that there should be a mutual
  interest to sustain and protect each other. There should not only be
  constitutional means, but personal motives to resist encroachments of
  one or either of the others. Thus ambition would be made to counteract
  ambition, the desire of power to check power, and the pressure of
  interest to balance an opposing interest.

         *       *       *       *       *

  * * * The judiciary is naturally and almost necessarily, as has been
  already said, the weakest department. It can have no means of influence
  by patronage. Its powers can never be wielded for itself. It has no
  command over the purse or the sword of the nation. It can neither lay
  taxes, nor appropriate money, nor command armies, nor appoint to office.
  It is never brought into contact with the people by constant appeals and
  solicitations and private intercourse, which belong to all the other
  departments of Government. It is seen only in controversies or in trials
  and punishments. Its rigid justice and impartiality give it no claims to
  favor, however they may to respect. It stands solitary and unsupported,
  except by that portion of public opinion which is interested only in the
  strict administration of justice. It can rarely secure the sympathy or
  zealous support either of the Executive or the Legislature. If they
  are not, as is not unfrequently the case, jealous of its prerogatives,
  the constant necessity of scrutinizing the acts of each, upon the
  application of any private person, and the painful duty of pronouncing
  judgment that these acts are a departure from the law or Constitution
  can have no tendency to conciliate kindness or nourish influence. It
  would seem, therefore, that some additional guards would, under the
  circumstances, be necessary to protect this department from the absolute
  dominion of the others. Yet rarely have any such guards been applied,
  and every attempt to introduce them has been resisted with a pertinacity
  which demonstrates how slow popular leaders are to introduce checks upon
  their own power and how slow the people are to believe that the
  judiciary is the real bulwark of their liberties. * * *

         *       *       *       *       *

  * * * If any department of the Government has undue influence or
  absorbing power, it certainly has not been the executive or judiciary.

In addition to what has been said by these distinguished writers, it may also be urged that
the dominant party in each House may, by the expulsion of a sufficient number of members or
by the exclusion from representation of a requisite number of States, reduce the minority to
less than one-third. Congress by these means might be enabled to pass a law, the objections
of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, which would render impotent the other two
departments of the Government and make inoperative the wholesome and restraining power which
it was intended by the framers of the Constitution should be exerted by them. This would be
a practical concentration of all power in the Congress of the United States; this, in the language
of the author of the Declaration of Independence, would be "precisely the definition of despotic
government."

I have preferred to reproduce these teachings of the great statesmen and constitutional lawyers
of the early and later days of the Republic rather than to rely simply upon an expression of
my own opinions. We can not too often recur to them, especially at a conjuncture like the present.
Their application to our actual condition is so apparent that they now come to us a living
voice, to be listened to with more attention than at any previous period of our history. We
have been and are yet in the midst of popular commotion. The passions aroused by a great civil
war are still dominant. It is not a time favorable to that calm and deliberate judgment which
is the only safe guide when radical changes in our institutions are to be made. The measure
now before me is one of those changes. It initiates an untried experiment for a people who
have said, with one voice, that it is not for their good. This alone should make us pause,
but it is not all. The experiment has not been tried, or so much as demanded, by the people
of the several States for themselves. In but few of the States has such an innovation been
allowed as giving the ballot to the colored population without any other qualification than
a residence of one year, and in most of them the denial of the ballot to this race is absolute
and by fundamental law placed beyond the domain of ordinary legislation. In most of those States
the evil of such suffrage would be partial, but, small as it would be, it is guarded by constitutional
barriers. Here the innovation assumes formidable proportions, which may easily grow to such
an extent as to make the white population a subordinate element in the body politic.

After full deliberation upon this measure, I can not bring myself to approve it, even upon
local considerations, nor yet as the beginning of an experiment on a larger scale.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 28, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I return to the Senate, in which House it originated, a bill entitled "An act to admit the
State of Colorado into the Union," to which I can not, consistently with my sense of duty,
give my approval. With the exception of an additional section, containing new provisions, it
is substantially the same as the bill of a similar title passed by Congress during the last
session, submitted to the President for his approval, returned with the objections contained
in a message bearing date the 15th of May last, and yet awaiting the reconsideration of the Senate.

A second bill, having in view the same purpose, has now passed both Houses of Congress and
been presented for my signature. Having again carefully considered the subject, I have been
unable to perceive any reason for changing the opinions which have already been communicated
to Congress. I find, on the contrary, that there are many objections to the proposed legislation
of which I was not at that time aware, and that while several of those which I then assigned
have in the interval gained in strength, yet others have been created by the altered character
of the measures now submitted.

The constitution under which the State government is proposed to be formed very properly contains
a provision that all laws in force at the time of its adoption and the admission of the State
into the Union shall continue as if the constitution had not been adopted. Among those laws
is one absolutely prohibiting negroes and mulattoes from voting. At the recent session of the
Territorial legislature a bill for the repeal of this law, introduced into the council, was
almost unanimously rejected; and at the very time when Congress was engaged in enacting the
bill now under consideration the legislature passed an act excluding negroes and mulattoes
from the right to sit as jurors. This bill was vetoed by the governor of the Territory, who
held that by the laws of the United States negroes and mulattoes are citizens, and subject
to the duties, as well as entitled to the rights, of citizenship. The bill, however, was passed,
the objections of the governor to the contrary notwithstanding, and is now a law of the Territory.
Yet in the bill now before me, by which it is proposed to admit the Territory as a State, it
is provided that "there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or any other rights to
any person by reason of race or color, excepting Indians not taxed."

The incongruity thus exhibited between the legislation of Congress and that of the Territory,
taken in connection with the protest against the admission of the State hereinafter referred
to, would seem clearly to indicate the impolicy and injustice of the proposed enactment.

It might, indeed, be a subject of grave inquiry, and doubtless will result in such inquiry
if this bill becomes a law, whether it does not attempt to exercise a power not conferred upon
Congress by the Federal Constitution. That instrument simply declares that Congress may admit
new States into the Union. It nowhere says that Congress may make new States for the purpose
of admitting them into the Union or for any other purpose; and yet this bill is as clear an
attempt to make the institutions as any in which the people themselves could engage.

In view of this action of Congress, the house of representatives of the Territory have earnestly
protested against being forced into the Union without first having the question submitted to
the people. Nothing could be more reasonable than the position which they thus assume; and
it certainly can not be the purpose of Congress to force upon a community against their will
a government which they do not believe themselves capable of sustaining.

The following is a copy of the protest alluded to as officially transmitted to me:

  Whereas it is announced in the public prints that it is the intention
  of Congress to admit Colorado as a State into the Union: Therefore,

  Resolved by the house of representatives of the Territory, That,
  representing, as we do, the last and only legal expression of public
  opinion on this question, we earnestly protest against the passage of a
  law admitting the State without first having the question submitted to
  a vote of the people, for the reasons, first, that we have a right to a
  voice in the selection of the character of our government; second, that
  we have not a sufficient population to support the expenses of a State
  government. For these reasons we trust that Congress will not force upon
  us a government against our will.

Upon information which I considered reliable, I assumed in my message of the 15th of May last
that the population of Colorado was not more than 30,000, and expressed the opinion that this
number was entirely too small either to assume the responsibilities or to enjoy the privileges
of a State.

It appears that previous to that time the legislature, with a view to ascertain the exact condition
of the Territory, had passed a law authorizing a census of the population to be taken. The
law made it the duty of the assessors in the several counties to take the census in connection
with the annual assessments, and, in order to secure a correct enumeration of the population,
allowed them a liberal compensation for the service by paying them for every name returned,
and added to their previous oath of office an oath to perform this duty with fidelity.

From the accompanying official report it appears that returns have been received from fifteen
of the eighteen counties into which the State is divided, and that their population amounts
in the aggregate to 24,909. The three remaining counties are estimated to contain 3,000, making
a total population of 27,909.

This census was taken in the summer season, when it is claimed that the population is much
larger than at any other period, as in the autumn miners in large numbers leave their work
and return to the East with the results of their summer enterprise.

The population, it will be observed, is but slightly in excess of one-fifth of the number required
as the basis of representation for a single Congressional district in any of the States--the
number being 127,000.

I am unable to perceive any good reason for such great disparity in the right of representation,
giving, as it would, to the people of Colorado not only this vast advantage in the House of
Representatives, but an equality in the Senate, where the other States are represented by millions.
With perhaps a single exception, no such inequality as this has ever before been attempted.
I know that it is claimed that the population of the different States at the time of their
admission has varied at different periods, but it has not varied much more than the population
of each decade and the corresponding basis of representation for the different periods.

The obvious intent of the Constitution was that no State should be admitted with a less population
than the ratio for a Representative at the time of application. The limitation in the second
section of the first article of the Constitution, declaring that "each State shall have at
least one Representative," was manifestly designed to protect the States which originally composed
the Union from being deprived, in the event of a waning population, of a voice in the popular
branch of Congress, and was never intended as a warrant to force a new State into the Union
with a representative population far below that which might at the time be required of sister
members of the Confederacy. This bill, in view of the prohibition of the same section, which
declares that "the number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000," is at
least a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution.

It is respectfully submitted that however Congress, under the pressure of circumstances, may
have admitted two or three States with less than a representative population at the time, there
has been no instance in which an application for admission has ever been entertained when the
population, as officially ascertained, was below 30,000.

Were there any doubt of this being the true construction of the Constitution, it would be dispelled
by the early and long-continued practice of the Federal Government. For nearly sixty years
after the adoption of the Constitution no State was admitted with a population believed at
the time to be less than the current ratio for a Representative, and the first instance in
which there appears to have been a departure from the principle was in 1845, in the case of
Florida. Obviously the result of sectional strife, we would do well to regard it as a warning
of evil rather than as an example for imitation; and I think candid men of all parties will
agree that the inspiring cause of the violation of this wholesome principle of restraint is
to be found in a vain attempt to balance these antagonisms, which refused to be reconciled
except through the bloody arbitrament of arms. The plain facts of our history will attest that
the great and leading States admitted since 1845, viz, Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota,
and Kansas, including Texas, which was admitted that year, have all come with an ample population
for one Representative, and some of them with nearly or quite enough for two.

To demonstrate the correctness of my views on this question, I subjoin a table containing a
list of the States admitted since the adoption of the Federal Constitution, with the date of
admission, the ratio of representation, and the representative population when admitted, deduced
from the United States census tables, the calculation being made for the period of the decade
corresponding with the date of admission.

Colorado, which it is now proposed to admit as a State, contains, as has already been stated,
a population less than 28,000, while the present ratio of representation is 127,000.

There can be no reason that I can perceive for the admission of Colorado that would not apply
with equal force to nearly every other Territory now organized; and I submit whether, if this
bill become a law, it will be possible to resist the logical conclusion that such Territories
as Dakota, Montana, and Idaho must be received as States whenever they present themselves,
without regard to the number of inhabitants they may respectively contain. Eight or ten new
Senators and four or five new members of the House of Representatives would thus be admitted
to represent a population scarcely exceeding that which in any other portion of the nation
is entitled to but a single member of the House of Representatives, while the average for two
Senators in the Union, as now constituted, is at least 1,000,000 people. It would surely be
unjust to all other sections of the Union to enter upon a policy with regard to the admission
of new States which might result in conferring such a disproportionate share of influence in
the National Legislature upon communities which, in pursuance of the wise policy of our fathers,
should for some years to come be retained under the fostering care and protection of the National
Government. If it is deemed just and expedient now to depart from the settled policy of the
nation during all its history, and to admit all the Territories to the rights and privileges
of States, irrespective of their population or fitness for such government, it is submitted
whether it would not be well to devise such measures as will bring the subject before the country
for consideration and decision. This would seem to be eminently wise, because, as has already
been stated, if it is right to admit Colorado now there is no reason for the exclusion of the
other Territories.

It is no answer to these suggestions that an enabling act was passed authorizing the people
of Colorado to take action on this subject. It is well known that that act was passed in consequence
of representations that the population reached, according to some statements, as high as 80,000,
and to none less than 50,000, and was growing with a rapidity which by the time the admission
could be consummated would secure a population of over 100,000. These representations proved
to have been wholly fallacious, and in addition the people of the Territory by a deliberate
vote decided that they would not assume the responsibilities of a State government. By that
decision they utterly exhausted all power that was conferred by the enabling act, and there
has been no step taken since in relation to the admission that has had the slightest sanction
or warrant of law.

The proceeding upon which the present application is based was in the utter absence of all
law in relation to it, and there is no evidence that the votes on the question of the formation
of a State government bear any relation whatever to the sentiment of the Territory. The protest
of the house of representatives previously quoted is conclusive evidence to the contrary.

But if none of these reasons existed against this proposed enactment, the bill itself, besides
being inconsistent in its provisions in conferring power upon a person unknown to the laws
and who may never have a legal existence, is so framed as to render its execution almost impossible.
It is, indeed, a question whether it is not in itself a nullity. To say the least, it is of
exceedingly doubtful propriety to confer the power proposed in this bill upon the "governor
elect," for as by its own terms the constitution is not to take effect until after the admission
of the State, he in the meantime has no more authority than any other private citizen. But
even supposing him to be clothed with sufficient authority to convene the legislature, what
constitutes the "State legislature" to which is to be referred the submission of the conditions
imposed by Congress? Is it a new body to be elected and convened by proclamation of the "governor
elect," or is it that body which met more than a year ago under the provisions of the State
constitution? By reference to the second section of the schedule and to the eighteenth section
of the fourth article of the State constitution it will be seen that the term of the members
of the house of representatives and that of one-half of the members of the senate expired on
the first Monday of the present month. It is clear that if there were no intrinsic objections
to the bill itself in relation to purposes to be accomplished this objection would be fatal,
as, it is apparent that the provisions of the third section of the bill to admit Colorado have
reference to a period and a state of facts entirely different from the present and affairs
as they now exist, and if carried into effect must necessarily lead to confusion.

Even if it were settled that the old and not a new body were to act, it would be found impracticable
to execute the law, because a considerable number of the members, as I am informed, have ceased
to be residents of the Territory, and in the sixty days within which the legislature is to
be convened after the passage of the act there would not be sufficient time to fill the vacancies
by new elections, were there any authority under which they could be held.

It may not be improper to add that if these proceedings were all regular and the result to
be obtained were desirable, simple justice to the people of the Territory would require a longer
period than sixty days within which to obtain action on the conditions proposed by the third
section of the bill. There are, as is well known, large portions of the Territory with which
there is and can be no general communication, there being several counties which from November
to May can only be reached by persons traveling on foot, while with other regions of the Territory,
occupied by a large portion of the population, there is very little more freedom of access.
Thus, if this bill should become a law, it would be impracticable to obtain any expression
of public sentiment in reference to its provisions, with a view to enlighten the legislature,
if the old body were called together, and, of course, equally impracticable to procure the
election of a new body. This defect might have been remedied by an extension of the time and
a submission of the question to the people, with a fair opportunity to enable them to express
their sentiments.

The admission of a new State has generally been regarded as an epoch in our history marking
the onward progress of the nation; but after the most careful and anxious inquiry on the subject
I can not perceive that the proposed proceeding is in conformity with the policy which from
the origin of the Government has uniformly prevailed in the admission of new States. I therefore
return the bill to the Senate without my signature.

WASHINGTON, January 29, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I return for reconsideration a bill entitled "An act for the admission of the State of Nebraska
into the Union," which originated in the Senate and has received the assent of both Houses
of Congress. A bill having in view the same object was presented for my approval a few hours
prior to the adjournment of the last session, but, submitted at a time when there was no opportunity
for a proper consideration of the subject, I withheld my signature and the measure failed to
become a law.

It appears by the preamble of this bill that the people of Nebraska, availing themselves of
the authority conferred upon them by the act passed on the 19th day of April, 1864, "have adopted
a constitution which, upon due examination, is found to conform to the provisions and comply
with the conditions of said act, and to be republican in its form of government, and that they
now ask for admission into the Union." This proposed law would therefore seem to be based upon
the declaration contained in the enabling act that upon compliance with its terms the people
of Nebraska should be admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States.
Reference to the bill, however, shows that while by the first section Congress distinctly accepts,
ratifies, and confirms the Constitution and State government which the people of the Territory
have formed for themselves, declares Nebraska to be one of the United States of America, and
admits her into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever,
the third section provides that this measure "shall not take effect except upon the fundamental
condition that within the State of Nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise,
or of any other right, to any person by reason of race or color, excepting Indians not taxed;
and upon the further fundamental condition that the legislature of said State, by a solemn
public act, shall declare the assent of said State to the said fundamental condition, and shall
transmit to the President of the United States an authentic copy of said act, upon receipt
whereof the President, by proclamation, shall forthwith announce the fact, whereupon said fundamental
condition shall be held as a part of the organic law of the State; and thereupon, and without
any further proceeding on the part of Congress, the admission of said State into the Union
shall be considered as complete." This condition is not mentioned in the original enabling
act; was not contemplated at the time of its passage; was not sought by the people themselves;
has not heretofore been applied to the inhabitants of any State asking admission, and is in
direct conflict with the constitution adopted by the people and declared in the preamble "to
be republican in its form of government," for in that instrument the exercise of the elective
franchise and the right to hold office are expressly limited to white citizens of the United
States. Congress thus undertakes to authorize and compel the legislature to change a constitution
which, it is declared in the preamble, has received the sanction of the people, and which by
this bill is "accepted, ratified, and confirmed" by the Congress of the nation.

The first and third sections of the bill exhibit yet further incongruity. By the one Nebraska
is "admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects
whatsoever," while by the other Congress demands as a condition precedent to her admission
requirements which in our history have never been asked of any people when presenting a constitution
and State government for the acceptance of the lawmaking power. It is expressly declared by
the third section that the bill "shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition
that within the State of Nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise, or of
any other right, to any person by reason of race or color, excepting Indians not taxed." Neither
more nor less than the assertion of the right of Congress to regulate the elective franchise
of any State hereafter to be admitted, this condition is in clear violation of the Federal
Constitution, under the provisions of which, from the very foundation of the Government, each
State has been left free to determine for itself the qualifications necessary for the exercise
of suffrage within its limits. Without precedent in our legislation, it is in marked contrast
with those limitations which, imposed upon States that from time to time have become members
of the Union, had for their object the single purpose of preventing any infringement of the
Constitution of the country.

If Congress is satisfied that Nebraska at the present time possesses sufficient population
to entitle her to full representation in the councils of the nation, and that her people desire
an exchange of a Territorial for a State government, good faith would seem to demand that she
should be admitted without further requirements than those expressed in the enabling act, with
all of which, it is asserted in the preamble, her inhabitants have complied. Congress may,
under the Constitution, admit new States or reject them, but the people of a State can alone
make or change their organic law and prescribe the qualifications requisite for electors. Congress,
however, in passing the bill in the shape in which it has been submitted for my approval, does
not merely reject the application of the people of Nebraska for present admission as a State
into the Union, on the ground that the constitution which they have submitted restricts the
exercise of the elective franchise to the white population, but imposes conditions which, if
accepted by the legislature, may, without the consent of the people, so change the organic
law as to make electors of all persons within the State without distinction of race or color.
In view of this fact, I suggest for the consideration of Congress whether it would not be just,
expedient, and in accordance with the principles of our Government to allow the people, by
popular vote or through a convention chosen by themselves for that purpose, to declare whether
or not they will accept the terms upon which it is now proposed to admit them into the Union.
This course would not occasion much greater delay than that which the bill contemplates when
it requires that the legislature shall be convened within thirty days after this measure shall
have become a law for the purpose of considering and deciding the conditions which it imposes,
and gains additional force when we consider that the proceedings attending the formation of
the State constitution were not in conformity with the provisions of the enabling act; that
in an aggregate vote of 7,776 the majority in favor of the constitution did not exceed 100;
and that it is alleged that, in consequence of frauds, even this result can not be received
as a fair expression of the wishes of the people. As upon them must fall the burdens of a State
organization, it is but just that they should be permitted to determine for themselves a question
which so materially affects their interests. Possessing a soil and a climate admirably adapted
to those industrial pursuits which bring prosperity and greatness to a people, with the advantage
of a central position on the great highway that will soon connect the Atlantic and Pacific
States, Nebraska is rapidly gaining in numbers and wealth, and may within a very brief period
claim admission on grounds which will challenge and secure universal assent. She can therefore
wisely and patiently afford to wait. Her population is said to be steadily and even rapidly
increasing, being now generally conceded as high as 40,000, and estimated by some whose judgment
is entitled to respect at a still greater number. At her present rate of growth she will in
a very short time have the requisite population for a Representative in Congress, and, what
is far more important to her own citizens, will have realized such an advance in material wealth
as will enable the expenses of a State government to be borne without oppression to the taxpayer.
Of new communities it may be said with special force--and it is true of old ones--that the
inducement to emigrants, other things being equal, is in almost the precise ratio of the rate
of taxation. The great States of the Northwest owe their marvelous prosperity largely to the
fact that they were continued as Territories until they had growth to be wealthy and populous
communities.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, March 2, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have carefully examined the bill "to regulate the tenure of certain civil offices." The material
portion of the bill is contained in the first section, and is of the effect following, namely:

  That every person holding any civil office to which he has been
  appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every
  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office and shall
  become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled
  to hold such office until a successor shall have been appointed
  by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and duly
  qualified; and that the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War,
  of the Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the
  Attorney-General shall hold their offices respectively for and during
  the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed and for
  one month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and
  consent of the Senate.

These provisions are qualified by a reservation in the fourth section, "that nothing contained
in the bill shall be construed to extend the term of any office the duration of which is limited
by law." In effect the bill provides that the President shall not remove from their places
any of the civil officers whose terms of service are not limited by law without the advice
and consent of the Senate of the United States. The bill in this respect conflicts, in my judgment,
with the Constitution of the United States. The question, as Congress is well aware, is by
no means a new one. That the power of removal is constitutionally vested in the President of
the United States is a principle which has been not more distinctly declared by judicial authority
and judicial commentators than it has been uniformly practiced upon by the legislative and
executive departments of the Government. The question arose in the House of Representatives
so early as the 16th of June, 1789, on the bill for establishing an Executive Department denominated
"the Department of Foreign Affairs." The first clause of the bill, after recapitulating the
functions of that officer and defining his duties, had these words: "To be removable from office
by the President of the United States." It was moved to strike out these words and the motion
was sustained with great ability and vigor. It was insisted that the President could not constitutionally
exercise the power of removal exclusively of the Senate; that the Federalist so interpreted
the Constitution when arguing for its adoption by the several States; that the Constitution
had nowhere given the President power of removal, either expressly or by strong implication,
but, on the contrary, had distinctly provided for removals from office by impeachment only.

A construction which denied the power of removal by the President was further maintained by
arguments drawn from the danger of the abuse of the power; from the supposed tendency of an
exposure of public officers to capricious removal to impair the efficiency of the civil service;
from the alleged injustice and hardship of displacing incumbents dependent upon their official
stations without sufficient consideration; from a supposed want of responsibility on the part
of the President, and from an imagined defect of guaranties against a vicious President who
might incline to abuse the power. On the other hand, an exclusive power of removal by the President
was defended as a true exposition of the text of the Constitution. It was maintained that there
are certain causes for which persons ought to be removed from office without being guilty of
treason, bribery, or malfeasance, and that the nature of things demands that it should be so.
"Suppose," it was said, "a man becomes insane by the visitation of God and is likely to ruin
our affairs; are the hands of the Government to be confined from warding off the evil? Suppose
a person in office not possessing the talents he was judged to have at the time of the appointment;
is the error not to be corrected? Suppose he acquires vicious habits and incurable indolence
or total neglect of the duties of his office, which shall work mischief to the public welfare;
is there no way to arrest the threatened danger? Suppose he becomes odious and unpopular by
reason of the measures he pursues--and this he may do without committing any positive offense
against the law; must he preserve his office in despite of the popular will? Suppose him grasping
for his own aggrandizement and the elevation of his connections by every means short of the
treason defined by the Constitution, hurrying your affairs to the precipice of destruction,
endangering your domestic tranquillity, plundering you of the means of defense, alienating
the affections of your allies and promoting the spirit of discord; must the tardy, tedious,
desultory road by way of impeachment be traveled to overtake the man who, barely confining
himself within the letter of the law, is employed in drawing off the vital principle of the
Government? The nature of things, the great objects of society, the express objects of the
Constitution itself, require that this thing should be otherwise. To unite the Senate with
the President in the exercise of the power," it was said, "would involve us in the most serious
difficulty. Suppose a discovery of any of those events should take place when the Senate is
not in session; how is the remedy to be applied? The evil could be avoided in no other way
than by the Senate sitting always." In regard to the danger of the power being abused if exercised
by one man it was said "that the danger is as great with respect to the Senate, who are assembled
from various parts of the continent, with different impressions and opinions;" "that such a
body is more likely to misuse the power of removal than the man whom the united voice of America
calls to the Presidential chair. As the nature of government requires the power of removal,"
it was maintained "that it should be exercised in this way by the hand capable of exerting
itself with effect; and the power must be conferred on the President by the Constitution as
the executive officer of the Government."

Mr. Madison, whose adverse opinion in the Federalist had been relied upon by those who denied
the exclusive power, now participated in the debate. He declared that he had reviewed his former
opinions, and he summed up the whole case as follows:

  The Constitution affirms that the executive power is vested in the
  President. Are there exceptions to this proposition? Yes; there are.
  The Constitution says that in appointing to office the Senate shall be
  associated with the President, unless in the case of inferior officers,
  when the law shall otherwise direct. Have we (that is, Congress) a
  right to extend this exception? I believe not. If the Constitution has
  invested all executive power in the President, I venture to assert
  that the Legislature has no right to diminish or modify his executive
  authority. The question now resolves itself into this: Is the power of
  displacing an executive power? I conceive that if any power whatsoever
  is in the Executive it is the power of appointing, overseeing, and
  controlling those who execute the laws. If the Constitution had not
  qualified the power of the President in appointing to office by
  associating the Senate with him in that business, would it not be clear
  that he would have the right by virtue of his executive power to make
  such appointment? Should we be authorized in defiance of that clause
  in the Constitution, "The executive power shall be vested in the
  President," to unite the Senate with the President in the appointment
  to office? I conceive not. If it is admitted that we should not be
  authorized to do this, I think it may be disputed whether we have a
  right to associate them in removing persons from office, the one power
  being as much of an executive nature as the other; and the first one is
  authorized by being excepted out of the general rule established by the
  Constitution in these words: "The executive power shall be vested in the
  President."

The question, thus ably and exhaustively argued, was decided by the House of Representatives,
by a vote of 34 to 20, in favor of the principle that the executive power of removal is vested
by the Constitution in the Executive, and in the Senate by the casting vote of the Vice-President.

The question has often been raised in subsequent times of high excitement, and the practice
of the Government has, nevertheless, conformed in all cases to the decision thus early made.

The question was revived during the Administration of President Jackson, who made, as is well
recollected, a very large number of removals, which were made an occasion of close and rigorous
scrutiny and remonstrance. The subject was long and earnestly debated in the Senate, and the
early construction of the Constitution was, nevertheless, freely accepted as binding and conclusive
upon Congress.

The question came before the Supreme Court of the United States in January, 1839, ex parte
Hennen. It was declared by the court on that occasion that the power of removal from office
was a subject much disputed, and upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained in
the early history of the Government. This related, however, to the power of the President to
remove officers appointed with the concurrence of the Senate, and the great question was whether
the removal was to be by the President alone or with the concurrence of the Senate, both constituting
the appointing power. No one denied the power of the President and Senate jointly to remove
where the tenure of the office was not fixed by the Constitution, which was a full recognition
of the principle that the power of removal was incident to the power of appointment; but it
was very early adopted as a practical construction of the Constitution that this power was
vested in the President alone, and such would appear to have been the legislative construction
of the Constitution, for in the organization of the three great Departments of State, War,
and Treasury, in the year 1789, provision was made for the appointment of a subordinate officer
by the head of the Department, who should have charge of the records, books, and papers appertaining
to the office when the head of the Department should be removed from office by the President
of the United States. When the Navy Department was established, in the year 1798, provision
was made for the charge and custody of the books, records, and documents of the Department
in case of vacancy in the office of Secretary by removal or otherwise. It is not here said
"by removal of the President," as is done with respect to the heads of the other Departments,
yet there can be no doubt that he holds his office with the same tenure as the other Secretaries
and is removable by the President. The change of phraseology arose, probably, from its having
become the settled and well-understood construction of the Constitution that the power of removal
was vested in the President alone in such cases, although the appointment of the officer is
by the President and Senate. (13 Peters, p. 139.)

Our most distinguished and accepted commentators upon the Constitution concur in the construction
thus early given by Congress, and thus sanctioned by the Supreme Court. After a full analysis
of the Congressional debate to which I have referred, Mr. Justice Story comes to this conclusion:

  After a most animated discussion, the vote finally taken in the House
  of Representatives was affirmative of the power of removal in the
  President, without any cooperation of the Senate, by the vote of 34
  members against 20. In the Senate the clause in the bill affirming the
  power was carried by the casting vote of the Vice-President. That the
  final decision of this question so made was greatly influenced by the
  exalted character of the President then in office was asserted at the
  time and has always been believed; yet the doctrine was opposed as well
  as supported by the highest talents and patriotism of the country. The
  public have acquiesced in this decision, and it constitutes, perhaps,
  the most extraordinary case in the history of the Government of a power
  conferred by implication on the Executive by the assent of a bare
  majority of Congress which has not been questioned on many other
  occasions.

The commentator adds:

  Nor is this general acquiescence and silence without a satisfactory
  explanation.

Chancellor Kent's remarks on the subject are as follows:

  On the first organization of the Government it was made a question
  whether the power of removal in case of officers appointed to hold
  at pleasure resided nowhere but in the body which appointed, and, of
  course, whether the consent of the Senate was not requisite to remove.
  This was the construction given to the Constitution, while it was
  pending for ratification before the State conventions, by the author of
  the Federalist. But the construction which was given to the Constitution
  by Congress, after great consideration and discussion, was different.
  The words of the act [establishing the Treasury Department] are: "And
  whenever the same shall be removed from office by the President of
  the United States, or in any other case of vacancy in the office, the
  assistant shall act." This amounted to a legislative construction of the
  Constitution, and it has ever since been acquiesced in and acted upon
  as a decisive authority in the case. It applies equally to every other
  officer of the Government appointed by the President, whose term of
  duration is not specially declared. It is supported by the weighty
  reason that the subordinate officers in the executive department ought
  to hold at the pleasure of the head of the department, because he is
  invested generally with the executive authority, and the participation
  in that authority by the Senate was an exception to a general principle
  and ought to be taken strictly. The President is the great responsible
  officer for the faithful execution of the law, and the power of removal
  was incidental to that duty, and might often be requisite to fulfill it.

Thus has the important question presented by this bill been settled, in the language of the
late Daniel Webster (who, while dissenting from it, admitted that it was settled), by construction,
settled by precedent, settled by the practice of the Government, and settled by statute. The
events of the last war furnished a practical confirmation of the wisdom of the Constitution
as it has hitherto been maintained in many of its parts, including that which is now the subject
of consideration. When the war broke out, rebel enemies, traitors, abettors, and sympathizers
were found in every Department of the Government, as well in the civil service as in the land
and naval military service. They were found in Congress and among the keepers of the Capitol;
in foreign missions; in each and all the Executive Departments; in the judicial service; in
the post-office, and among the agents for conducting Indian affairs. Upon probable suspicion
they were promptly displaced by my predecessor, so far as they held their offices under executive
authority, and their duties were confided to new and loyal successors. No complaints against
that power or doubts of its wisdom were entertained in any quarter. I sincerely trust and believe
that no such civil war is likely to occur again. I can not doubt, however, that in whatever
form and on whatever occasion sedition can raise an effort to hinder or embarrass or defeat
the legitimate action of this Government, whether by preventing the collection of revenue,
or disturbing the public peace, or separating the States, or betraying the country to a foreign
enemy, the power of removal from office by the Executive, as it has heretofore existed and
been practiced, will be found indispensable.

Under these circumstances, as a depositary of the executive authority of the nation, I do not
feel at liberty to unite with Congress in reversing it by giving my approval to the bill. At
the early day when this question was settled, and, indeed, at the several periods when it has
subsequently been agitated, the success of the Constitution of the United States, as a new
and peculiar system of free representative government, was held doubtful in other countries,
and was even a subject of patriotic apprehension among the American people themselves. A trial
of nearly eighty years, through the vicissitudes of foreign conflicts and of civil war, is
confidently regarded as having extinguished all such doubts and apprehensions for the future.
During that eighty years the people of the United States have enjoyed a measure of security,
peace, prosperity, and happiness never surpassed by any nation. It can not be doubted that
the triumphant success of the Constitution is due to the wonderful wisdom with which the functions
of government were distributed between the three principal departments--the legislative, the
executive, and the judicial--and to the fidelity with which each has confined itself or been
confined by the general voice of the nation within its peculiar and proper sphere. While a
just, proper, and watchful jealousy of executive power constantly prevails, as it ought ever
to prevail, yet it is equally true that an efficient Executive, capable, in the language of
the oath prescribed to the President, of executing the laws and, within the sphere of executive
action, of preserving, protecting, and defending the Constitution of the United States, is
an indispensable security for tranquillity at home and peace, honor, and safety abroad. Governments
have been erected in many countries upon our model. If one or many of them have thus far failed
in fully securing to their people the benefits which we have derived from our system, it may
be confidently asserted that their misfortune has resulted from their unfortunate failure to
maintain the integrity of each of the three great departments while preserving harmony among
them all.

Having at an early period accepted the Constitution in regard to the Executive office in the
sense in which it was interpreted with the concurrence of its founders, I have found no sufficient
grounds in the arguments now opposed to that construction or in any assumed necessity of the
times for changing those opinions. For these reasons I return the bill to the Senate, in which
House it originated, for the further consideration of Congress which the Constitution prescribes.
Insomuch as the several parts of the bill which I have not considered are matters chiefly of
detail and are based altogether upon the theory of the Constitution from which I am obliged
to dissent, I have not thought it necessary to examine them with a view to make them an occasion
of distinct and special objections.

Experience, I think, has shown that it is the easiest, as it is also the most attractive, of
studies to frame constitutions for the self-government of free states and nations. But I think
experience has equally shown that it is the most difficult of all political labors to preserve
and maintain such free constitutions of self-government when once happily established. I know
no other way in which they can be preserved and maintained except by a constant adherence to
them through the various vicissitudes of national existence, with such adaptations as may become
necessary, always to be effected, however, through the agencies and in the forms prescribed
in the original constitutions themselves.

Whenever administration fails or seems to fail in securing any of the great ends for which
republican government is established, the proper course seems to be to renew the original spirit
and forms of the Constitution itself.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, March 2, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

I have examined the bill "to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States"
with the care and anxiety which its transcendent importance is calculated to awaken. I am unable
to give it my assent, for reasons so grave that I hope a statement of them may have some influence
on the minds of the patriotic and enlightened men with whom the decision must ultimately rest.

The bill places all the people of the ten States therein named under the absolute domination
of military rulers; and the preamble undertakes to give the reason upon which the measure is
based and the ground upon which it is justified. It declares that there exists in those States
no legal governments and no adequate protection for life or property, and asserts the necessity
of enforcing peace and good order within their limits. Is this true as matter of fact?

It is not denied that the States in question have each of them an actual government, with all
the powers--executive, judicial, and legislative--which properly belong to a free state. They
are organized like the other States of the Union, and, like them, they make, administer, and
execute the laws which concern their domestic affairs. An existing de facto government, exercising
such functions as these, is itself the law of the state upon all matters within its jurisdiction.
To pronounce the supreme law-making power of an established state illegal is to say that law
itself is unlawful.

The provisions which these governments have made for the preservation of order, the suppression
of crime, and the redress of private injuries are in substance and principle the same as those
which prevail in the Northern States and in other civilized countries. They certainly have
not succeeded in preventing the commission of all crime, nor has this been accomplished anywhere
in the world. There, as well as elsewhere, offenders sometimes escape for want of vigorous
prosecution, and occasionally, perhaps, by the inefficiency of courts or the prejudice of jurors.
It is undoubtedly true that these evils have been much increased and aggravated, North and
South, by the demoralizing influences of civil war and by the rancorous passions which the
contest has engendered. But that these people are maintaining local governments for themselves
which habitually defeat the object of all government and render their own lives and property
insecure is in itself utterly improbable, and the averment of the bill to that effect is not
supported by any evidence which has come to my knowledge. All the information I have on the
subject convinces me that the masses of the Southern people and those who control their public
acts, while they entertain diverse opinions on questions of Federal policy, are completely
united in the effort to reorganize their society on the basis of peace and to restore their
mutual prosperity as rapidly and as completely as their circumstances will permit.

The bill, however, would seem to show upon its face that the establishment of peace and good
order is not its real object. The fifth section declares that the preceding sections shall
cease to operate in any State where certain events shall have happened. These events are, first,
the selection of delegates to a State convention by an election at which negroes shall be allowed
to vote; second, the formation of a State constitution by the convention so chosen; third,
the insertion into the State constitution of a provision which will secure the right of voting
at all elections to negroes and to such white men as may not be disfranchised for rebellion
or felony; fourth, the submission of the constitution for ratification to negroes and white
men not disfranchised, and its actual ratification by their vote; fifth, the submission of
the State constitution to Congress for examination and approval, and the actual approval of
it by that body; sixth, the adoption of a certain amendment to the Federal Constitution by
a vote of the legislature elected under the new constitution; seventh, the adoption of said
amendment by a sufficient number of other States to make it a part of the Constitution of the
United States. All these conditions must be fulfilled before the people of any of these States
can be relieved from the bondage of military domination; but when they are fulfilled, then
immediately the pains and penalties of the bill are to cease, no matter whether there be peace
and order or not, and without any reference to the security of life or property. The excuse
given for the bill in the preamble is admitted by the bill itself not to be real. The military
rule which it establishes is plainly to be used, not for any purpose of order or for the prevention
of crime, but solely as a means of coercing the people into the adoption of principles and
measures to which it is known that they are opposed, and upon which they have an undeniable
right to exercise their own judgment.

I submit to Congress whether this measure is not in its whole character, scope, and object
without precedent and without authority, in palpable conflict with the plainest provisions
of the Constitution, and utterly destructive to those great principles of liberty and humanity
for which our ancestors on both sides of the Atlantic have shed so much blood and expended
so much treasure.

The ten States named in the bill are divided into five districts. For each district an officer
of the Army, not below the rank of a brigadier-general, is to be appointed to rule over the
people; and he is to be supported with an efficient military force to enable him to perform
his duties and enforce his authority. Those duties and that authority, as defined by the third
section of the bill, are "to protect all persons in their rights of person and property, to
suppress insurrection, disorder, and violence, and to punish or cause to be punished all disturbers
of the public peace or criminals." The power thus given to the commanding officer over all
the people of each district is that of an absolute monarch. His mere will is to take the place
of all law. The law of the States is now the only rule applicable to the subjects placed under
his control, and that is completely displaced by the clause which declares all interference
of State authority to be null and void. He alone is permitted to determine what are rights
of person or property, and he may protect them in such way as in his discretion may seem proper.
It places at his free disposal all the lands and goods in his district, and he may distribute
them without let or hindrance to whom he pleases. Being bound by no State law, and there being
no other law to regulate the subject, he may make a criminal code of his own; and he can make
it as bloody as any recorded in history, or he can reserve the privilege of acting upon the
impulse of his private passions in each case that arises. He is bound by no rules of evidence;
there is, indeed, no provision by which he is authorized or required to take any evidence at
all. Everything is a crime which he chooses to call so, and all persons are condemned whom
he pronounces to be guilty. He is not bound to keep any record or make any report of his proceedings.
He may arrest his victims wherever he finds them, without warrant, accusation, or proof of
probable cause. If he gives them a trial before he inflicts the punishment, he gives it of
his grace and mercy, not because he is commanded so to do.

To a casual reader of the bill it might seem that some kind of trial was secured by it to persons
accused of crime, but such is not the case. The officer "may allow local civil tribunals to
try offenders," but of course this does not require that he shall do so. If any State or Federal
court presumes to exercise its legal jurisdiction by the trial of a malefactor without his
special permission, he can break it up and punish the judges and jurors as being themselves
malefactors. He can save his friends from justice, and despoil his enemies contrary to justice.

It is also provided that "he shall have power to organize military commissions or tribunals:"
but this power he is not commanded to exercise. It is merely permissive, and is to be used
only "when in his judgment it may be necessary for the trial of offenders." Even if the sentence
of a commission were made a prerequisite to the punishment of a party, it would be scarcely
the slightest check upon the officer, who has authority to organize it as he pleases, prescribe
its mode of proceeding, appoint its members from his own subordinates, and revise all its decisions.
Instead of mitigating the harshness of his single rule, such a tribunal would be used much
more probably to divide the responsibility of making it more cruel and unjust.

Several provisions dictated by the humanity of Congress have been inserted in the bill, apparently
to restrain the power of the commanding officer; but it seems to me that they are of no avail
for that purpose. The fourth section provides: First. That trials shall not be unnecessarily
delayed; but I think I have shown that the power is given to punish without trial; and if so,
this provision is practically inoperative. Second. Cruel or unusual punishment is not to be
inflicted; but who is to decide what is cruel and what is unusual? The words have acquired
a legal meaning by long use in the courts. Can it be expected that military officers will understand
or follow a rule expressed in language so purely technical and not pertaining in the least
degree to their profession? If not, then each officer may define cruelty according to his own
temper, and if it is not usual he will make it usual. Corporal punishment, imprisonment, the
gag, the ball and chain, and all the almost insupportable forms of torture invented for military
punishment lie within the range of choice. Third. The sentence of a commission is not to be
executed without being approved by the commander, if it affects life or liberty, and a sentence
of death must be approved by the President. This applies to cases in which there has been a
trial and sentence. I take it to be clear, under this bill, that the military commander may
condemn to death without even the form of a trial by a military commission, so that the life
of the condemned may depend upon the will of two men instead of one.

It is plain that the authority here given to the military officer amounts to absolute despotism.
But to make it still more unendurable, the bill provides that it may be delegated to as many
subordinates as he chooses to appoint, for it declares that he shall "punish or cause to be
punished." Such a power has not been wielded by any monarch in England for more than five hundred
years. In all that time no people who speak the English language have borne such servitude.
It reduces the whole population of the ten States--all persons, of every color, sex, and condition,
and every stranger within their limits--to the most abject and degrading slavery. No master
ever had a control so absolute over the slaves as this bill gives to the military officers
over both white and colored persons.

It may be answered to this that the officers of the Army are too magnanimous, just, and humane
to oppress and trample upon a subjugated people. I do not doubt that army officers are as well
entitled to this kind of confidence as any other class of men. But the history of the world
has been written in vain if it does not teach us that unrestrained authority can never be safely
trusted in human hands. It is almost sure to be more or less abused under any circumstances,
and it has always resulted in gross tyranny where the rulers who exercise it are strangers
to their subjects and come among them as the representatives of a distant power, and more especially
when the power that sends them is unfriendly. Governments closely resembling that here proposed
have been fairly tried in Hungary and Poland, and the suffering endured by those people roused
the sympathies of the entire world. It was tried in Ireland, and, though tempered at first
by principles of English law, it gave birth to cruelties so atrocious that they are never recounted
without just indignation. The French Convention armed its deputies with this power and sent
them to the southern departments of the Republic. The massacres, murders, and other atrocities
which they committed show what the passions of the ablest men in the most civilized society
will tempt them to do when wholly unrestrained by law.

The men of our race in every age have struggled to tie up the hands of their governments and
keep them within the law, because their own experience of all mankind taught them that rulers
could not be relied on to concede those lights which they were not legally bound to respect.
The head of a great empire has sometimes governed it with a mild and paternal sway, but the
kindness of an irresponsible deputy never yields what the law does not extort from him. Between
such a master and the people subjected to his domination there can be nothing but enmity; he
punishes them if they resist his authority, and if they submit to it he hates them for their
servility.

I come now to a question which is, if possible, still more important. Have we the power to
establish and carry into execution a measure like this? I answer, Certainly not, if we derive
our authority from the Constitution and if we are bound by the limitations which it imposes.

This proposition is perfectly clear, that no branch of the Federal Government--executive, legislative,
or judicial--can have any just powers except those which it derives through and exercises under
the organic law of the Union. Outside of the Constitution we have no legal authority more than
private citizens, and within it we have only so much as that instrument gives us. This broad
principle limits all our functions and applies to all subjects. It protects not only the citizens
of States which are within the Union, but it shields every human being who comes or is brought
under our jurisdiction. We have no right to do in one place more than in another that which
the Constitution says we shall not do at all. If, therefore, the Southern States were in truth
out of the Union, we could not treat their people in a way which the fundamental law forbids.

Some persons assume that the success of our arms in crushing the opposition which was made
in some of the States to the execution of the Federal laws reduced those States and all their
people--the innocent as well as the guilty--to the condition of vassalage and gave us a power
over them which the Constitution does not bestow or define or limit. No fallacy can be more
transparent than this. Our victories subjected the insurgents to legal obedience, not to the
yoke of an arbitrary despotism. When an absolute sovereign reduces his rebellious subjects,
he may deal with them according to his pleasure, because he had that power before. But when
a limited monarch puts down an insurrection, he must still govern according to law. If an insurrection
should take place in one of our States against the authority of the State government and end
in the overthrow of those who planned it, would that take away the rights of all the people
of the counties where it was favored by a part or a majority of the population? Could they
for such a reason be wholly outlawed and deprived of their representation in the legislature?
I have always contended that the Government of the United States was sovereign within its constitutional
sphere; that it executed its laws, like the States themselves, by applying its coercive power
directly to individuals, and that it could put down insurrection with the same effect as a
State and no other. The opposite doctrine is the worst heresy of those who advocated secession,
and can not be agreed to without admitting that heresy to be right.

Invasion, insurrection, rebellion, and domestic violence were anticipated when the Government
was framed, and the means of repelling and suppressing them were wisely provided for in the
Constitution; but it was not thought necessary to declare that the States in which they might
occur should be expelled from the Union. Rebellions, which were invariably suppressed, occurred
prior to that out of which these questions grow; but the States continued to exist and the
Union remained unbroken. In Massachusetts, in Pennsylvania, in Rhode Island, and in New York,
at different periods in our history, violent and armed opposition to the United States was
carried on; but the relations of those States with the Federal Government were not supposed
to be interrupted or changed thereby after the rebellious portions of their population were
defeated and put down. It is true that in these earlier cases there was no formal expression
of a determination to withdraw from the Union, but it is also true that in the Southern States
the ordinances of secession were treated by all the friends of the Union as mere nullities
and are now acknowledged to be so by the States themselves. If we admit that they had any force
or validity or that they did in fact take the States in which they were passed out of the Union,
we sweep from under our feet all the grounds upon which we stand in justifying the use of Federal
force to maintain the integrity of the Government.

This is a bill passed by Congress in time of peace. There is not in any one of the States brought
under its operation either war or insurrection. The laws of the States and of the Federal Government
are all in undisturbed and harmonious operation. The courts, State and Federal, are open and
in the full exercise of their proper authority. Over every State comprised in these five military
districts, life, liberty, and property are secured by State laws and Federal laws, and the
National Constitution is everywhere in force and everywhere obeyed. What, then, is the ground
on which this bill proceeds? The title of the bill announces that it is intended "for the more
efficient government" of these ten States. It is recited by way of preamble that no legal State
governments "nor adequate protection for life or property" exist in those States, and that
peace and good order should be thus enforced. The first thing which arrests attention upon
these recitals, which prepare the way for martial law, is this, that the only foundation upon
which martial law can exist under our form of government is not stated or so much as pretended.
Actual war, foreign invasion, domestic insurrection--none of these appear; and none of these,
in fact, exist. It is not even recited that any sort of war or insurrection is threatened.
Let us pause here to consider, upon this question of constitutional law and the power of Congress,
a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in ex parte Milligan.

I will first quote from the opinion of the majority of the court:

  Martial law can not arise from a threatened invasion. The necessity
  must be actual and present, the invasion real, such as effectually
  closes the courts and deposes the civil administration.

We see that martial law comes in only when actual war closes the courts and deposes the civil
authority; but this bill, in time of peace, makes martial law operate as though we were in
actual war, and becomes the cause instead of the consequence of the abrogation of civil authority.
One more quotation:

  It follows from what has been said on this subject that there are
  occasions when martial law can be properly applied. If in foreign
  invasion or civil war the courts are actually closed, and it is
  impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on
  the theater of active military operations, where war really prevails,
  there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority
  thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as
  no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial
  rule until the laws can have their free course.

I now quote from the opinion of the minority of the court, delivered by Chief Justice Chase:

  We by no means assert that Congress can establish and apply the laws of
  war where no war has been declared or exists. Where peace exists, the
  laws of peace must prevail.

This is sufficiently explicit. Peace exists in all the territory to which this bill applies.
It asserts a power in Congress, in time of peace, to set aside the laws of peace and to substitute
the laws of war. The minority, concurring with the majority, declares that Congress does not
possess that power. Again, and, if possible, more emphatically, the Chief Justice, with remarkable
clearness and condensation, sums up the whole matter as follows:

  There are under the Constitution three kinds of military
  jurisdiction--one to be exercised both in peace and war; another to be
  exercised in time of foreign war without the boundaries of the United
  States, or in time of rebellion and civil war within States or districts
  occupied by rebels treated as belligerents; and a third to be exercised
  in time of invasion or insurrection within the limits of the United
  States, or during rebellion within the limits of the States maintaining
  adhesion to the National Government, when the public danger requires its
  exercise. The first of these may be called jurisdiction under military
  law, and is found in acts of Congress prescribing rules and articles of
  war or otherwise providing for the government of the national forces;
  the second may be distinguished as military government, superseding
  as far as may be deemed expedient the local law, and exercised by
  the military commander under the direction of the President, with
  the express or implied sanction of Congress; while the third may be
  denominated martial law proper, and is called into action by Congress,
  or temporarily, when the action of Congress can not be invited, and in
  the case of justifying or excusing peril, by the President, in times of
  insurrection or invasion or of civil or foreign war, within districts
  or localities where ordinary law no longer adequately secures public
  safety and private rights.

It will be observed that of the three kinds of military jurisdiction which can be exercised
or created under our Constitution there is but one that can prevail in time of peace, and that
is the code of laws enacted by Congress for the government of the national forces. That body
of military law has no application to the citizen, nor even to the citizen soldier enrolled
in the militia in time of peace. But this bill is not a part of that sort of military law,
for that applies only to the soldier and not to the citizen, whilst, contrariwise, the military
law provided by this bill applies only to the citizen and not to the soldier.

I need not say to the representatives of the American people that their Constitution forbids
the exercise of judicial power in any way but one--that is, by the ordained and established
courts. It is equally well known that in all criminal cases a trial by jury is made indispensable
by the express words of that instrument. I will not enlarge on the inestimable value of the
right thus secured to every freeman or speak of the danger to public liberty in all parts of
the country which must ensue from a denial of it anywhere or upon any pretense. A very recent
decision of the Supreme Court has traced the history, vindicated the dignity, and made known
the value of this great privilege so clearly that nothing more is needed. To what extent a
violation of it might be excused in time of war or public danger may admit of discussion, but
we are providing now for a time of profound peace, when there is not an armed soldier within
our borders except those who are in the service of the Government. It is in such a condition
of things that an act of Congress is proposed which, if carried out, would deny a trial by
the lawful courts and juries to 9,000,000 American citizens and to their posterity for an indefinite
period. It seems to be scarcely possible that anyone should seriously believe this consistent
with a Constitution which declares in simple, plain, and unambiguous language that all persons
shall have that right and that no person shall ever in any case be deprived of it. The Constitution
also forbids the arrest of the citizen without judicial warrant, founded on probable cause.
This bill authorizes an arrest without warrant, at the pleasure of a military commander. The
Constitution declares that "no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous
crime unless on presentment by a grand jury." This bill holds every person not a soldier answerable
for all crimes and all charges without any presentment. This bill sets aside all process of
law, and makes the citizen answerable in his person and property to the will of one man, and
as to his life to the will of two. Finally, the Constitution declares that "the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in case of rebellion or invasion,
the public safety may require it;" whereas this bill declares martial law (which of itself
suspends this great writ) in time of peace, and authorizes the military to make the arrest,
and gives to the prisoner only one privilege, and that is a trial "without unnecessary delay."
He has no hope of release from custody, except the hope, such as it is, of release by acquittal
before a military commission.

The United States are bound to guarantee to each State a republican form of government. Can
it be pretended that this obligation is not palpably broken if we carry out a measure like
this, which wipes away every vestige of republican government in ten States and puts the life,
property, liberty, and honor of all the people in each of them under the domination of a single
person clothed with unlimited authority?

The Parliament of England, exercising the omnipotent power which it claimed, was accustomed
to pass bills of attainder; that is to say, it would convict men of treason and other crimes
by legislative enactment. The person accused had a hearing, sometimes a patient and fair one,
but generally party prejudice prevailed instead of justice. It often became necessary for Parliament
to acknowledge its error and reverse its own action. The fathers of our country determined
that no such thing should occur here. They withheld the power from Congress, and thus forbade
its exercise by that body, and they provided in the Constitution that no State should pass
any bill of attainder. It is therefore impossible for any person in this country to be constitutionally
convicted or punished for any crime by a legislative proceeding of any sort. Nevertheless,
here is a bill of attainder against 9,000,000 people at once. It is based upon an accusation
so vague as to be scarcely intelligible and found to be true upon no credible evidence. Not
one of the 9,000,000 was heard in his own defense. The representatives of the doomed parties
were excluded from all participation in the trial. The conviction is to be followed by the
most ignominious punishment ever inflicted on large masses of men. It disfranchises them by
hundreds of thousands and degrades them all, even those who are admitted to be guiltless, from
the rank of freemen to the condition of slaves.

The purpose and object of the bill--the general intent which pervades it from beginning to
end--is to change the entire structure and character of the State governments and to compel
them by force to the adoption of organic laws and regulations which they are unwilling to accept
if left to themselves. The negroes have not asked for the privilege of voting; the vast majority
of them have no idea what it means. This bill not only thrusts it into their hands, but compels
them, as well as the whites, to use it in a particular way. If they do not form a constitution
with prescribed articles in it and afterwards elect a legislature which will act upon certain
measures in a prescribed way, neither blacks nor whites can be relieved from the slavery which
the bill imposes upon them. Without pausing here to consider the policy or impolicy of Africanizing
the southern part of our territory, I would simply ask the attention of Congress to that manifest,
well-known, and universally acknowledged rule of constitutional law which declares that the
Federal Government has no jurisdiction, authority, or power to regulate such subjects for any
State. To force the right of suffrage out of the hands of the white people and into the hands
of the negroes is an arbitrary violation of this principle.

This bill imposes martial law at once, and its operations will begin so soon as the general
and his troops can be put in place. The dread alternative between its harsh rule and compliance
with the terms of this measure is not suspended, nor are the people afforded any time for free
deliberation. The bill says to them, take martial law first, then deliberate. And when they
have done all that this measure requires them to do other conditions and contingencies over
which they have no control yet remain to be fulfilled before they can be relieved from martial
law. Another Congress must first approve the Constitution made in conformity with the will
of this Congress and must declare these States entitled to representation in both Houses. The
whole question thus remains open and unsettled and must again occupy the attention of Congress;
and in the meantime the agitation which now prevails will continue to disturb all portions
of the people.

The bill also denies the legality of the governments of ten of the States which participated
in the ratification of the amendment to the Federal Constitution abolishing slavery forever
within the jurisdiction of the United States and practically excludes them from the Union.
If this assumption of the bill be correct, their concurrence can not be considered as having
been legally given, and the important fact is made to appear that the consent of three-fourths
of the States--the requisite number--has not been constitutionally obtained to the ratification
of that amendment, thus leaving the question of slavery where it stood before the amendment
was officially declared to have become a part of the Constitution.

That the measure proposed by this bill does violate the Constitution in the particulars mentioned
and in many other ways which I forbear to enumerate is too clear to admit of the least doubt.
It only remains to consider whether the injunctions of that instrument ought to be obeyed or
not. I think they ought to be obeyed, for reasons which I will proceed to give as briefly as
possible.

In the first place, it is the only system of free government which we can hope to have as a
nation. When it ceases to be the rule of our conduct, we may perhaps take our choice between
complete anarchy, a consolidated despotism, and a total dissolution of the Union; but national
liberty regulated by law will have passed beyond our reach.

It is the best frame of government the world ever saw. No other is or can be so well adapted
to the genius, habits, or wants of the American people. Combining the strength of a great empire
with unspeakable blessings of local self-government, having a central power to defend the general
interests, and recognizing the authority of the States as the guardians of industrial rights,
it is "the sheet anchor of our safety abroad and our peace at home." These great ends have
been attained heretofore, and will be again by faithful obedience to it; but they are certain
to be lost if we treat with disregard its sacred obligations.

It was to punish the gross crime of defying the Constitution and to vindicate its supreme authority
that we carried on a bloody war of four years' duration. Shall we now acknowledge that we sacrificed
a million of lives and expended billions of treasure to enforce a Constitution which is not
worthy of respect and preservation?

Those who advocated the right of secession alleged in their own justification that we had no
regard for law and that their rights of property, life, and liberty would not be safe under
the Constitution as administered by us. If we now verify their assertion, we prove that they
were in truth and in fact fighting for their liberty, and instead of branding their leaders
with the dishonoring name of traitors against a righteous and legal government we elevate them
in history to the rank of self-sacrificing patriots, consecrate them to the admiration of the
world, and place them by the side of Washington, Hampden, and Sidney. No; let us leave them
to the infamy they deserve, punish them as they should be punished, according to law, and take
upon ourselves no share of the odium which they should bear alone.

It is a part of our public history which can never be forgotten that both Houses of Congress,
in July, 1861, declared in the form of a solemn resolution that the war was and should be carried
on for no purpose of subjugation, but solely to enforce the Constitution and laws, and that
when this was yielded by the parties in rebellion the contest should cease, with the constitutional
rights of the States and of individuals unimpaired. This resolution was adopted and sent forth
to the world unanimously by the Senate and with only two dissenting voices in the House. It
was accepted by the friends of the Union in the South as well as in the North as expressing
honestly and truly the object of the war. On the faith of it many thousands of persons in both
sections gave their lives and their fortunes to the cause. To repudiate it now by refusing
to the States and to the individuals within them the rights which the Constitution and laws
of the Union would secure to them is a breach of our plighted honor for which I can imagine
no excuse and to which I cannot voluntarily become a party.

The evils which spring from the unsettled state of our Government will be acknowledged by all.
Commercial intercourse is impeded, capital is in constant peril, public securities fluctuate
in value, peace itself is not secure, and the sense of moral and political duty is impaired.
To avert these calamities from our country it is imperatively required that we should immediately
decide upon some course of administration which can be steadfastly adhered to. I am thoroughly
convinced that any settlement or compromise or plan of action which is inconsistent with the
principles of the Constitution will not only be unavailing, but mischievous; that it will but
multiply the present evils, instead of removing them. The Constitution, in its whole integrity
and vigor, throughout the length and breadth of the land, is the best of all compromises. Besides,
our duty does not, in my judgment, leave us a choice between that and any other. I believe
that it contains the remedy that is so much needed, and that if the coordinate branches of
the Government would unite upon its provisions they would be found broad enough and strong
enough to sustain in time of peace the nation which they bore safely through the ordeal of
a protracted civil war. And is it not far better that the work of restoration should be accomplished
by simple compliance with the plain requirements of the Constitution than by a recourse to
measures which in effect destroy the States and threaten the subversion of the General Government?
All that is necessary to settle this simple but important question without further agitation
or delay is a willingness on the part of all to sustain the Constitution and carry its provisions
into practical operation. If to-morrow either branch of Congress would declare that upon the
presentation of their credentials members constitutionally elected and loyal to the General
Government would be admitted to seats in Congress, while all others would be excluded and their
places remain vacant until the selection by the people of loyal and qualified persons, and
if at the same time assurance were given that this policy would be continued until all the
States were represented in Congress, it would send a thrill of joy throughout the entire land,
as indicating the inauguration of a system which must speedily bring tranquillity to the public
mind.

While we are legislating upon subjects which are of great importance to the whole people, and
which must affect all parts of the country, not only during the life of the present generation,
but for ages to come, we should remember that all men are entitled at least to a hearing in
the councils which decide upon the destiny of themselves and their children. At present ten
States are denied representation, and when the Fortieth Congress assembles on the 4th day of
the present month sixteen States will be without a voice in the House of Representatives. This
grave fact, with the important questions before us, should induce us to pause in a course of
legislation which, looking solely to the attainment of political ends, fails to consider the
rights it transgresses, the law which it violates, or the institutions which it imperils.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas, in virtue of the power conferred by the act of Congress approved June 22, 1860, sections
15 and 24 of which act were designed by proper provisions to secure the strict neutrality of
citizens of the United States residing in or visiting the Empires of China and Japan, a notification
was issued on the 4th of August last by the legation of the United States in Japan, through
the consulates of the open ports of that Empire, requesting American shipmasters not to approach
the coasts of Suwo and Nagato pending the then contemplated hostilities between the Tycoon
of Japan and the Daimio of the said Provinces; and

Whereas authentic information having been received by the said legation that such hostilities
had actually commenced, a regulation in furtherance of the aforesaid notification and pursuant
to the act referred to was issued by the minister resident of the United States in Japan forbidding
American merchant vessels from stopping or anchoring at any port or roadstead in that country
except the three opened ports, viz, Kanagawa (Yokohama), Nagasaki, and Hakodate, unless in
distress or forced by stress of weather, as provided by treaty, and giving notice that masters
of vessels committing a breach of the regulation would thereby render themselves liable to
prosecution and punishment and also to forfeiture of the protection of the United States if
the visit to such nonopened port or roadstead should either involve a breach of treaty or be
construed as an act in aid of insurrection or rebellion:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States of America,
with a view to prevent acts which might injuriously affect the relations existing between the
Government of the United States and that of Japan, do hereby call public attention to the aforesaid
notification and regulation, which are hereby sanctioned and confirmed.

To the House of Representatives:

In giving my approval to the joint resolution providing for the expenses of carrying into full
effect an act entitled "An act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States,"
I am moved to do so for the following reason: The seventh section of the act supplementary
to the act for the more efficient government of the rebel States provides that the expenses
incurred under or by virtue of that act shall be paid out of any moneys in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated. This provision is wholly unlimited as to the amount to be expended,
whereas the resolution now before me limits the appropriation to $500,000. I consider this
limitation as a very necessary check against unlimited expenditure and liabilities. Yielding
to that consideration, I feel bound to approve this resolution, without modifying in any manner
any objections heretofore stated against the original and supplemental acts.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I transmit to Congress a copy of a convention between the United States and the Republic of
Venezuela for the adjustment of claims of citizens of the United States on the Government of
that Republic. The ratifications of this convention were exchanged at Caracas on the 10th of
April last. As its first article stipulates that the commissioners shall meet in that city
within four months from that date, the expediency of passing the usual act for the purpose
of carrying the convention into effect will, of course, engage the attention of Congress.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 6, 1867.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I transmit to Congress a copy of a treaty between the United States and His Majesty the Emperor
of all the Russias, the ratifications of which were exchanged in this city on the 20th day
of June last.

This instrument provides for a cession of territory to the United States in consideration of
the payment of $7,200,000 in gold. The attention of Congress is invited to the subject of an
appropriation for this payment, and also to that of proper legislation for the occupation and
government of the territory as a part of the dominion of the United States.

of December 10, 1866, requesting "a list of names of all persons engaged in the late rebellion
against the United States Government who have been pardoned by the President from April 15,
1865, to this date; that said list shall also state the rank of each person who has been so
pardoned, if he has been engaged in the military service of the so-called Confederate government,
and the position if he shall have held any civil office under said so-called Confederate government;
and shall also further state whether such person has at any time prior to April 14, 1861, held
any office under the United States Government, and, if so, what office, together with the reasons
for granting such pardon, and also the names of the person or persons at whose solicitation
such pardon was granted."

In compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th of July, requesting
the President "to inform the House what States have ratified the amendment to the Constitution
of the United States proposed by concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, June
16, 1866," I transmit a report from the Secretary of State.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 10, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

In compliance with so much of the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 8th instant
as requests information in regard to certain agreements said to have been entered into between
the United States, European and West Virginia Land and Mining Company and certain reputed agents
of the Republic of Mexico, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the papers accompanying
it.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 11, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

In compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 3d instant, requesting
me to transmit all the official correspondence between the Department of State and the Hon.
Lewis D. Campbell, late minister to Mexico, and also that with his successor, I communicate
a report from the Secretary of State and the papers accompanying it.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 12, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

In compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant, requesting me to transmit
"all the official correspondence between the Department of State and the Hon. Lewis D. Campbell,
late minister of the United States to the Republic of Mexico, from the time of his appointment,
also the correspondence of the Department with his successor," I communicate herewith a report
on the subject from the Secretary of State, from which it appears that the correspondence called
for by the Senate has already been communicated to the House of Representatives.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 15, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit herewith reports from the Secretary of War and the Attorney-General, containing
the information called for by the resolution of the Senate of the 3d instant, requesting the
President "to communicate to the Senate copies of all orders, instructions, circular letters,
or letters of advice issued to the respective military officers assigned to the command of
the several military districts under the act passed March 2, 1867, entitled 'An act to provide
for the more efficient government of the rebel States,' and the act supplementary thereto,
passed March 23, 1867; also copies of all opinions given to him by the Attorney-General of
the United States touching the construction and interpretation of said acts, and of all correspondence
relating to the operation, construction, or execution of said acts that may have taken place
between himself and any of said commanders, or between him and the General of the Army, or
between the latter and any of said commanders, touching the same subjects; also copies of all
orders issued by any of said commanders in carrying out the provisions of said acts or either
of them; also that he inform the Senate what progress has been made in the matter of registration
under said acts, and whether the sum of money heretofore appropriated for carrying them out
is probably sufficient."

In answer to that portion of the resolution which inquires whether the sum of money heretofore
appropriated for carrying these acts into effect is probably sufficient, reference is made
to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War. It will be seen from that report that the
appropriation of $500,000 made in the act approved March 30, 1867, for the purpose of carrying
into effect the "Act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States," passed
March 2, 1867, and the act supplementary thereto, passed March 23, 1867, has already been expended
by the commanders of the several military districts, and that, in addition, the sum of $1,648,277
is required for present purposes.

It is exceedingly difficult at the present time to estimate the probable expense of carrying
into full effect the two acts of March last and the bill which passed the two Houses of Congress
on the 13th instant. If the existing governments of ten States of the Union are to be deposed
and their entire machinery is to be placed under the exclusive control and authority of the
respective district commanders, all the expenditures incident to the administration of such
governments must necessarily be incurred by the Federal Government. It is believed that, in
addition to the $2,100,000 already expended or estimated for, the sum which would be required
for this purpose would not be less than $14,000,000--the aggregate amount expended prior to
the rebellion in the administration of their respective governments by the ten States embraced
in the provisions of these acts. This sum would no doubt be considerably augmented if the machinery
of these States is to be operated by the Federal Government, and would be largely increased
if the United States, by abolishing the existing State governments, should become responsible
for liabilities incurred by them before the rebellion in laudable efforts to develop their
resources, and in no wise created for insurrectionary or revolutionary purposes. The debts
of these States, thus legitimately incurred, when accurately ascertained will, it is believed,
approximate $100,000,000; and they are held not only by our own citizens, among whom are residents
of portions of the country which have ever remained loyal to the Union, but by persons who
are the subjects of foreign governments. It is worthy the consideration of Congress and the
country whether, if the Federal Government by its action were to assume such obligations, so
large an addition to our public expenditures would not seriously impair the credit of the nation,
or, on the other hand, whether the refusal of Congress to guarantee the payment of the debts
of these States, after having displaced or abolished their State governments, would not be
viewed as a violation of good faith and a repudiation by the national legislature of liabilities
which these States had justly and legally incurred.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 18, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

In compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant, requesting me to furnish
to that body copies of any correspondence on the files of the Department of State relating
to any recent events in Mexico, I communicate a report from the Secretary of State, with the
papers accompanying it.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 18, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

In compliance with that part of the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 8th instant
which requests me to transmit to the House of Representatives any official correspondence or
other information relating to the capture and execution of Maximilian and the arrest and reported
execution of Santa Anna in Mexico, I inclose herewith a report from the Secretary of State,
from which it appears that the correspondence called for by the House of Representatives has
already been communicated to the Senate of the United States.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 20, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

I have received a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives on the 8th instant, inquiring
"whether the publication which appeared in the National Intelligencer and other public prints
on the 21st of June last, and which contained a statement of the proceedings of the President
and Cabinet in respect to an interpretation of the acts of Congress commonly known as the reconstruction
acts, was made by the authority of the President or with his knowledge and consent," and "whether
the full and complete record or minute of all the proceedings, conclusions, and determinations
of the President and Cabinet relating to said acts of Congress and their interpretation is
embraced or given in said publication," and also requesting that "a true copy of the full and
complete record or minute of such proceedings, conclusions, and determinations in regard to
the interpretation of said reconstruction acts" be furnished to the House.

In compliance with the request of the House of Representatives, I have to state that the publication
to which the resolution refers was made by proper authority, and that it comprises the proceedings
in Cabinet relating to the acts of Congress mentioned in the inquiry, upon which, after taking
the opinions of the heads of the several Executive Departments of the Government, I had announced
my own conclusions. Other questions arising from these acts have been under consideration,
upon which, however, no final conclusion has been reached. No publication in reference to them
has, therefore, been authorized by me; but should it at any time be deemed proper and advantageous
to the interests of the country to make public those or any other proceedings of the Cabinet,
authority for their promulgation will be given by the President.

A correct copy of the record of the proceedings, published in the National Intelligencer and
other newspapers on the 21st ultimo, is herewith transmitted, together with a copy of the instructions
based upon the conclusions of the President and Cabinet and sent to the commanders of the several
military districts created by act of Congress of March 2, 1867.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

  IN CABINET, June 18, 1867.

  Present: The President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
  the Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the
  Postmaster-General, the Attorney-General, the Acting Secretary of
  the Interior.

  The President announced that he had under consideration the two opinions
  from the Attorney-General as to the legal questions arising upon the
  acts of Congress commonly known as the reconstruction acts, and that in
  view of the great magnitude of the subject and of the various interests
  involved he deemed it proper to have it considered fully in the Cabinet
  and to avail himself of all the light which could be afforded by the
  opinions and advice of the members of the Cabinet, to enable him to see
  that these laws be faithfully executed and to decide what orders and
  instructions are necessary and expedient to be given to the military
  commanders.

  The President said further that the branch of the subject that seemed to
  him first in order for consideration was as to the instructions to be
  sent to the military commanders for their guidance and for the guidance
  of persons offering for registration. The instructions proposed by the
  Attorney-General, as set forth in the summary contained in his last
  opinion, will therefore be now considered.

  The summary was then read at length.

  The reading of the summary having been concluded, each section was then
  considered, discussed, and voted upon as follows:

  1. The oath prescribed in the supplemental act defines all the
  qualifications required, and every person who can take that oath is
  entitled to have his name entered upon the list of voters.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who votes "nay."

  2. The board of registration have no authority to administer any other
  oath to the person applying for registration than this prescribed
  oath, nor to administer any oath to any other person touching the
  qualifications of the applicant or the falsity of the oath so taken
  by him.

  No provision is made for challenging the qualifications of the applicant
  or entering upon any trial or investigation of his qualifications,
  either by witnesses or any other form of proof.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who votes "nay."

  3. As to citizenship and residence:

  The applicant for registration must be a citizen of the State and of the
  United States, and must be a resident of a county or parish included in
  the election district. He may be registered if he has been such citizen
  for a period less than twelve months at the time he applies for
  registration, but he can not vote at any election unless his citizenship
  has then extended to the full term of one year. As to such a person, the
  exact length of his citizenship should be noted opposite his name on the
  list, so that it may appear on the day of election, upon reference to
  the list, whether the full term has then been accomplished.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  4. An unnaturalized person can not take this oath, but an alien who has
  been naturalized can take it, and no other proof of naturalization can
  be required from him.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who votes "nay."

  5. No one who is not 21 years of age at the time of registration can
  take the oath, for he must swear that he has then attained that age.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  6. No one who has been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion
  against the United States or for felony committed against the laws of
  any State or of the United States can take this oath.

  The actual participation in a rebellion or the actual commission of a
  felony does not amount to disfranchisement. The sort of disfranchisement
  here meant is that which is declared by law passed by competent
  authority, or which has been fixed upon the criminal by the sentence of
  the court which tried him for the crime.

  No law of the United States has declared the penalty of disfranchisement
  for participation in rebellion alone; nor is it known that any such law
  exists in either of these ten States, except, perhaps, Virginia, as to
  which State special instructions will be given.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who dissents as to the
  second and third paragraphs.

  7. As to disfranchisement arising from having held office followed by
  participation in rebellion:

  This is the most important part of the oath, and requires strict
  attention to arrive at its meaning.

  Two elements must concur in order to disqualify a person under these
  clauses: First, the office and official oath to support the Constitution
  of the United States; second, engaging afterwards in rebellion. Both
  must exist to work disqualification, and must happen in the order of
  time mentioned.

  A person who has held an office and taken the oath to support the
  Federal Constitution and has not afterwards engaged in rebellion is not
  disqualified. So, too, a person who has engaged in rebellion, but has
  not theretofore held an office and taken that oath, is not disqualified.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who votes "nay."

  8. Officers of the United States:

  As to these the language is without limitation. The person who has at
  any time prior to the rebellion held any office, civil or military,
  under the United States, and has taken an official oath to support the
  Constitution of the United States, is subject to disqualification.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  9. Militia officers of any State prior to the rebellion are not subject
  to disqualification.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who votes "nay."

  10. Municipal officers--that is to say, officers of incorporated cities,
  towns, and villages, such as mayors, aldermen, town council, police, and
  other city or town officers--are not subject to disqualification.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  11. Persons who have prior to the rebellion been members of the Congress
  of the United States or members of a State legislature are subject to
  disqualification, but those who have been members of conventions framing
  or amending the constitution of a State prior to the rebellion are not
  subject to disqualification.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  12. All the executive or judicial officers of any State who took an
  oath to support the Constitution of the United States are subject
  to disqualification, including county officers. They are subject to
  disqualification if they were required to take as a part of their
  official oath the oath to support the Constitution of the United States.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  13. Persons who exercised mere employments under State authority are
  not disqualified; such as commissioners to lay out roads, commissioners
  of public works, visitors of State institutions, directors of State
  institutions, examiners of banks, notaries public, commissioners to
  take acknowledgments of deeds.

  Concurred in unanimously; but the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
  the Treasury, and the Secretary of War express the opinion that lawyers
  are such officers as are disqualified if they participated in the
  rebellion. Two things must exist as to any person to disqualify him from
  voting: First, the office held prior to the rebellion, and, afterwards,
  participation in the rebellion.

  14. An act to fix upon a person the offense of engaging in rebellion
  under this law must be an overt and voluntary act, done with the intent
  of aiding or furthering the common unlawful purpose. A person forced
  into the rebel service by conscription or under a paramount authority
  which he could not safely disobey, and who would not have entered such
  service if left to the free exercise of his own will, can not be held
  to be disqualified from voting.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who votes "nay" as the
  proposition is stated.

  15. Mere acts of charity, where the intent is to relieve the wants of
  the object of such charity, and not done in aid of the cause in which he
  may have been engaged, do not disqualify; but organized contributions
  of food and clothing for the general relief of persons engaged in the
  rebellion, and not of a merely sanitary character, but contributed to
  enable them to perform their unlawful object, maybe classed with acts
  which do disqualify. Forced contributions to the rebel cause in the form
  of taxes or military assessments, which a person was compelled to pay or
  contribute, do not disqualify; but voluntary contributions to the rebel
  cause, even such indirect contributions as arise from the voluntary loan
  of money to the rebel authorities or purchase of bonds or securities
  created to afford the means of carrying on the rebellion, will work
  disqualification.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  16. All those who in legislative or other official capacity were engaged
  in the furtherance of the common unlawful purpose, where the duties of
  the office necessarily had relation to the support of the rebellion,
  such as members of the rebel conventions, congresses, and legislatures,
  diplomatic agents of the rebel Confederacy, and other officials whose
  offices were created for the purpose of more effectually carrying on
  hostilities or whose duties appertained to the support of the rebel
  cause, must be held to be disqualified; but officers who during the
  rebellion discharged official duties not incident to war, but only such
  duties as belong even to a state of peace and were necessary to the
  preservation of order and the administration of law, are not to be
  considered as thereby engaging in rebellion or as disqualified. Disloyal
  sentiments, opinions, or sympathies would not disqualify, but where a
  person has by speech or writing incited others to engage in rebellion he
  must come under the disqualification.

  All vote "aye" except the Secretary of War, who dissents to the second
  paragraph, with the exception of the words "where a person has by speech
  or by writing incited others to engage in rebellion he must come under
  the disqualification."

  17. The duties of the board appointed to superintend the elections.

  This board, having the custody of the list of registered voters in the
  district for which it is constituted, must see that the name of the
  person offering to vote is found upon the registration list, and if such
  proves to be the fact it is the duty of the board to receive his vote if
  then qualified by residence. They can not receive the vote of any person
  whose name is not upon the list, though he may be ready to take the
  registration oath, and although he may satisfy them that he was unable
  to have his name registered at the proper time, in consequence of
  absence, sickness, or other cause.

  The board can not enter into any inquiry as to the qualifications of
  any person whose name is not on the registration list, or as to the
  qualifications of any person whose name is on that list..

  Concurred in unanimously.

  18. The mode of voting is provided in the act to be by ballot. The board
  will keep a record and poll book of the election, showing the votes,
  list of voters, and the persons elected by a plurality of the votes cast
  at the election, and make returns of these to the commanding general of
  the district.

  Concurred in unanimously.

  19. The board appointed for registration and for superintending the
  elections must take the oath prescribed by the act of Congress approved
  July 2, 1862, entitled "An act to prescribe an oath of office."

  Concurred in unanimously.

  IN CABINET, June 20, 1867.

  Present: The same Cabinet officers as on the 18th, except the Acting
  Secretary of the Interior.

  The President announced to the Cabinet that after full deliberation he
  concurred with the majority upon the sections of the summary upon which
  the Secretary of War expressed his dissent, and that he concurred with
  the Cabinet upon those sections approved by unanimous vote; that as it
  appeared the military commanders entertained doubts upon the points
  covered by the summary, and as their action hitherto had not been
  uniform, he deemed it proper, without further delay, to communicate in
  a general order[27] to the respective commanders the points set forth
  in the summary.

[Footnote 27: See Executive order of June 20, 1867, pp. 552-556.]

VETO MESSAGES.

WASHINGTON, March 23, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

I have considered the bill entitled "An act supplementary to an act entitled 'An act to provide
for the more efficient government of the rebel States,' passed March 2, 1867, and to facilitate
restoration," and now return it to the House of Representatives with my objections.

This bill provides for elections in the ten States brought under the operation of the original
act to which it is supplementary. Its details are principally directed to the elections for
the formation of the State constitutions, but by the sixth section of the bill "all elections"
in these States occurring while the original act remains in force are brought within its purview.
Referring to these details, it will be found that, first of all, there is to be a registration
of the voters. No one whose name has not been admitted on the list is to be allowed to vote
at any of these elections. To ascertain who is entitled to registration, reference is made
necessary, by the express language of the supplement, to the original act and to the pending
bill. The fifth section of the original act provides, as to voters, that they shall be "male
citizens of the State, 21 years old and upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition,
who have been residents of said State for one year." This is the general qualification, followed,
however, by many exceptions. No one can be registered, according to the original act, "who
may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion"--a provision which left undetermined
the question as to what amounted to disfranchisement, and whether without a judicial sentence
the act itself produced that effect. This supplemental bill superadds an oath, to be taken
by every person before his name can be admitted upon the registration, that he has "not been
disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or civil war against the United States." It
thus imposes upon every person the necessity and responsibility of deciding for himself, under
the peril of punishment by a military commission if he makes a mistake, what works disfranchisement
by participation in rebellion and what amounts to such participation. Almost every man--the
negro as well as the white--above 21 years of age who was resident in these ten States during
the rebellion, voluntarily or involuntarily, at some time and in some way did participate in
resistance to the lawful authority of the General Government. The question with the citizen
to whom this oath is to be proposed must be a fearful one, for while the bill does not declare
that perjury may be assigned for such false swearing nor fix any penalty for the offense, we
must not forget that martial law prevails; that every person is answerable to a military commission,
without previous presentment by a grand jury, for any charge that may be made against him,
and that the supreme authority of the military commander determines the question as to what
is an offense and what is to be the measure of punishment.

The fourth section of the bill provides "that the commanding general of each district shall
appoint as many boards of registration as may be necessary, consisting of three loyal officers
or persons." The only qualification stated for these officers is that they must be "loyal."
They may be persons in the military service or civilians, residents of the State or strangers.
Yet these persons are to exercise most important duties and are vested with unlimited discretion.
They are to decide what names shall be placed upon the register and from their decision there
is to be no appeal. They are to superintend the elections and to decide all questions which
may arise. They are to have the custody of the ballots and to make return of the persons elected.
Whatever frauds or errors they may commit must pass without redress. All that is left for the
commanding general is to receive the returns of the elections, open the same, and ascertain
who are chosen "according to the returns of the officers who conducted said elections." By
such means and with this sort of agency are the conventions of delegates to be constituted.

As the delegates are to speak for the people, common justice would seem to require that they
should have authority from the people themselves. No convention so constituted will in any
sense represent the wishes of the inhabitants of these States, for under the all-embracing
exceptions of these laws, by a construction which the uncertainty of the clause as to disfranchisement
leaves open to the board of officers, the great body of the people may be excluded from the
polls and from all opportunity of expressing their own wishes or voting for delegates who will
faithfully reflect their sentiments.

I do not deem it necessary further to investigate the details of this bill. No consideration
could induce me to give my approval to such an election law for any purpose, and especially
for the great purpose of framing the constitution of a State. If ever the American citizen
should be left to the free exercise of his own judgment it is when he is engaged in the work
of forming the fundamental law under which he is to live. That work is his work, and it can
not properly be taken out of his hands. All this legislation proceeds upon the contrary assumption
that the people of each of these States shall have no constitution except such as may be arbitrarily
dictated by Congress and formed under the restraint of military rule. A plain statement of
facts makes this evident.

In all these States there are existing constitutions, framed in the accustomed way by the people.
Congress, however, declares that these constitutions are not "loyal and republican," and requires
the people to form them anew. What, then, in the opinion of Congress, is necessary to make
the constitution of a State "loyal and republican"? The original act answers the question:
It is universal negro suffrage--a question which the Federal Constitution leaves exclusively
to the States themselves. All this legislative machinery of martial law, military coercion,
and political disfranchisement is avowedly for that purpose and none other. The existing constitutions
of the ten States conform to the acknowledged standards of loyalty and republicanism. Indeed,
if there are degrees in republican forms of government, their constitutions are more republican
now than when these States, four of which were members of the original thirteen, first became
members of the Union.

Congress does not now demand that a single provision of their constitutions be changed except
such as confine suffrage to the white population. It is apparent, therefore, that these provisions
do not conform to the standard of republicanism which Congress seeks to establish. That there
may be no mistake, it is only necessary that reference should be made to the original act,
which declares "such constitution shall provide that the elective franchise shall be enjoyed
by all such persons as have the qualifications herein stated for electors of delegates." What
class of persons is here meant clearly appears in the same section; that is to say, "the male
citizens of said State 21 years old and upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition,
who have been resident in said State for one year previous to the day of such election."

Without these provisions no constitution which can be framed in any one of the ten States will
be of any avail with Congress. This, then, is the test of what the constitution of a State
of this Union must contain to make it republican. Measured by such a standard, how few of the
States now composing the Union have republican constitutions! If in the exercise of the constitutional
guaranty that Congress shall secure to every State a republican form of government universal
suffrage for blacks as well as whites is a sine qua non, the work of reconstruction may as
well begin in Ohio as in Virginia, in Pennsylvania as in North Carolina.

When I contemplate the millions of our fellow-citizens of the South with no alternative left
but to impose upon themselves this fearful and untried experiment of complete negro enfranchisement--and
white disfranchisement, it may be, almost as complete--or submit indefinitely to the rigor
of martial law, without a single attribute of freemen, deprived of all the sacred guaranties
of our Federal Constitution, and threatened with even worse wrongs, if any worse are possible,
it seems to me their condition is the most deplorable to which any people can be reduced. It
is true that they have been engaged in rebellion and that their object being a separation of
the States and a dissolution of the Union there was an obligation resting upon every loyal
citizen to treat them as enemies and to wage war against their cause.

Inflexibly opposed to any movement imperiling the integrity of the Government, I did not hesitate
to urge the adoption of all measures necessary for the suppression of the insurrection. After
a long and terrible struggle the efforts of the Government were triumphantly successful, and
the people of the South, submitting to the stern arbitrament, yielded forever the issues of
the contest. Hostilities terminated soon after it became my duty to assume the responsibilities
of the chief executive officer of the Republic, and I at once endeavored to repress and control
the passions which our civil strife had engendered, and, no longer regarding these erring millions
as enemies, again acknowledged them as our friends and our countrymen. The war had accomplished
its objects. The nation was saved and that seminal principle of mischief which from the birth
of the Government had gradually but inevitably brought on the rebellion was totally eradicated.
Then, it seemed to me, was the auspicious time to commence the work of reconciliation; then,
when these people sought once more our friendship and protection, I considered it our duty
generously to meet them in the spirit of charity and forgiveness and to conquer them even more
effectually by the magnanimity of the nation than by the force of its arms. I yet believe that
if the policy of reconciliation then inaugurated, and which contemplated an early restoration
of these people to all their political rights, had received the support of Congress, every
one of these ten States and all their people would at this moment be fast anchored in the Union
and the great work which gave the war all its sanction and made it just and holy would have
been accomplished. Then over all the vast and fruitful regions of the South peace and its blessings
would have prevailed, while now millions are deprived of rights guaranteed by the Constitution
to every citizen and after nearly two years of legislation find themselves placed under an
absolute military despotism. "A military republic, a government founded on mock elections and
supported only by the sword," was nearly a quarter of a century since pronounced by Daniel
Webster, when speaking of the South American States, as "a movement, indeed, but a retrograde
and disastrous movement, from the regular and old-fashioned monarchical systems;" and he added:

  If men would enjoy the blessings of republican government, they must
  govern themselves by reason, by mutual counsel and consultation, by a
  sense and feeling of general interest, and by the acquiescence of the
  minority in the will of the majority, properly expressed; and, above
  all, the military must be kept, according to the language of our bill of
  rights, in strict subordination to the civil authority. Wherever this
  lesson is not both learned and practiced there can be no political
  freedom. Absurd, preposterous is it, a scoff and a satire on free forms
  of constitutional liberty, for frames of government to be prescribed by
  military leaders and the right of suffrage to be exercised at the point
  of the sword.

I confidently believe that a time will come when these States will again occupy their true
positions in the Union. The barriers which now seem so obstinate must yield to the force of
an enlightened and just public opinion, and sooner or later unconstitutional and oppressive
legislation will be effaced from our statute books. When this shall have been consummated,
I pray God that the errors of the past may be forgotten and that once more we shall be a happy,
united, and prosperous people, and that at last, after the bitter and eventful experience through
which the nation has passed, we shall all come to know that our only safety is in the preservation
of our Federal Constitution and in according to every American citizen and to every State the
rights which that Constitution secures.

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 10, 1867.[28]

The first session of the Fortieth Congress adjourned on the 30th day of March, 1867. This bill,[29]
which was passed during that session, was not presented for my approval by the Hon. Edmund
G. Ross, of the Senate of the United States, and a member of the Committee on Enrolled Bills,
until Monday, the 1st day of April, 1867, two days after the adjournment. It is not believed
that the approval of any bill after the adjournment of Congress, whether presented before or
after such adjournment, is authorized by the Constitution of the United States, that instrument
expressly declaring that no bill shall become a law the return of which may have been prevented
by the adjournment of Congress. To concede that under the Constitution the President, after
the adjournment of Congress, may, without limitation in respect to time, exercise the power
of approval, and thus determine at his discretion whether or not bills shall become laws, might
subject the executive and legislative departments of the Government to influences most pernicious
to correct legislation and sound public morals, and--with a single exception, occurring during
the prevalence of civil war--would be contrary to the established practice of the Government
from its inauguration to the present time. This bill will therefore be filed in the office
of the Secretary of State without my approval.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 19, 1867.

To the House of Representatives of the United States:

I return herewith the bill entitled "An act supplementary to an act entitled 'An act to provide
for the more efficient government of the rebel States,' passed on the 2d day of March, 1867,
and the act supplementary thereto, passed, on the 23d day of March, 1867," and will state as
briefly as possible some of the reasons which prevent me from giving it my approval.

This is one of a series of measures passed by Congress during the last four months on the subject
of reconstruction. The message returning the act of the 2d of March last states at length my
objections to the passage of that measure. They apply equally well to the bill now before me,
and I am content merely to refer to them and to reiterate my conviction that they are sound
and unanswerable.

There are some points peculiar to this bill, which I will proceed at once to consider.

The first section purports to declare "the true intent and meaning," in some particulars, of
the two prior acts upon this subject.

It is declared that the intent of those acts was, first, that the existing governments in the
ten "rebel States" "were not legal State governments," and, second, "that thereafter said governments,
if continued, were to be continued subject in all respects to the military commanders of the
respective districts and to the paramount authority of Congress."

Congress may by a declaratory act fix upon a prior act a construction altogether at variance
with its apparent meaning, and from the time, at least, when such a construction is fixed the
original act will be construed to mean exactly what it is stated to mean by the declaratory
statute. There will be, then, from the time this bill may become a law no doubt, no question,
as to the relation in which the "existing governments" in those States, called in the original
act "the provisional governments," stand toward the military authority. As those relations
stood before the declaratory act, these "governments," it is true, were made subject to absolute
military authority in many important respects, but not in all, the language of the act being
"subject to the military authority of the United States, as hereinafter prescribed." By the
sixth section of the original act these governments were made "in all respects subject to the
paramount authority of the United States."

Now by this declaratory act it appears that Congress did not by the original act intend to
limit the military authority to any particulars or subjects therein "prescribed," but meant
to make it universal. Thus over all of these ten States this military government is now declared
to have unlimited authority. It is no longer confined to the preservation of the public peace,
the administration of criminal law, the registration of voters, and the superintendence of
elections, but "in all respects" is asserted to be paramount to the existing civil governments.

It is impossible to conceive any state of society more intolerable than this; and yet it is
to this condition that 12,000,000 American citizens are reduced by the Congress of the United
States. Over every foot of the immense territory occupied by these American citizens the Constitution
of the United States is theoretically in full operation. It binds all the people there and
should protect them; yet they are denied every one of its sacred guaranties.

Of what avail will it be to any one of these Southern people when seized by a file of soldiers
to ask for the cause of arrest or for the production of the warrant? Of what avail to ask for
the privilege of bail when in military custody, which knows no such thing as bail? Of what
avail to demand a trial by jury, process for witnesses, a copy of the indictment, the privilege
of counselor that greater privilege, the writ of habeas corpus?

The veto of the original bill of the 2d of March was based on two distinct grounds--the interference
of Congress in matters strictly appertaining to the reserved powers of the States and the establishment
of military tribunals for the trial of citizens in time of peace. The impartial reader of that
message will understand that all that it contains with respect to military despotism and martial
law has reference especially to the fearful power conferred on the district commanders to displace
the criminal courts and assume jurisdiction to try and to punish by military boards; that,
potentially, the suspension of the habeas corpus was martial law and military despotism. The
act now before me not only declares that the intent was to confer such military authority,
but also to confer unlimited military authority over all the other courts of the State and
over all the officers of the State--legislative, executive, and judicial. Not content with
the general grant of power, Congress, in the second section of this bill, specifically gives
to each military commander the power "to suspend or remove from office, or from the performance
of official duties and the exercise of official powers, any officer or person holding or exercising,
or professing to hold or exercise, any civil or military office or duty in such district under
any power, election, appointment, or authority derived from, or granted by, or claimed under
any so-called State, or the government thereof, or any municipal or other division thereof."

A power that hitherto all the departments of the Federal Government, acting in concert or separately,
have not dared to exercise is here attempted to be conferred on a subordinate military officer.
To him, as a military officer of the Federal Government, is given the power, supported by "a
sufficient military force," to remove every civil officer of the State. What next? The district
commander, who has thus displaced the civil officer, is authorized to fill the vacancy by the
detail of an officer or soldier of the Army, or by the appointment of "some other person."

This military appointee, whether an officer, a soldier, or "some other person," is to perform
"the duties of such officer or person so suspended or removed." In other words, an officer
or soldier of the Army is thus transformed into a civil officer. He may be made a governor,
a legislator, or a judge. However unfit he may deem himself for such civil duties, he must
obey the order. The officer of the Army must, if "detailed," go upon the supreme bench of the
State with the same prompt obedience as if he were detailed to go upon a court-martial. The
soldier, if detailed to act as a justice of the peace, must obey as quickly as if he were detailed
for picket duty.

What is the character of such a military civil officer? This bill declares that he shall perform
the duties of the civil office to which he is detailed. It is clear, however, that he does
not lose his position in the military service. He is still an officer or soldier of the Army;
he is still subject to the rules and regulations which govern it, and must yield due deference,
respect, and obedience toward his superiors.

The clear intent of this section is that the officer or soldier detailed to fill a civil office
must execute its duties according to the laws of the State. If he is appointed a governor of
a State, he is to execute the duties as provided by the laws of that State, and for the time
being his military character is to be suspended in his new civil capacity. If he is appointed
a State treasurer, he must at once assume the custody and disbursement of the funds of the
State, and must perform those duties precisely according to the laws of the State, for he is
intrusted with no other official duty or other official power. Holding the office of treasurer
and intrusted with funds, it happens that he is required by the State laws to enter into bond
with security and to take an oath of office; yet from the beginning of the bill to the end
there is no provision for any bond or oath of office, or for any single qualification required
under the State law, such as residence, citizenship, or anything else. The only oath is that
provided for in the ninth section, by the terms of which everyone detailed or appointed to
any civil office in the State is required "to take and to subscribe the oath of office prescribed
by law for officers of the United States." Thus an officer of the Army of the United States
detailed to fill a civil office in one of these States gives no official bond and takes no
official oath for the performance of his new duties, but as a civil officer of the State only
takes the same oath which he had already taken as a military officer of the United States.
He is, at last, a military officer performing civil duties, and the authority under which he
acts is Federal authority only; and the inevitable result is that the Federal Government, by
the agency of its own sworn officers, in effect assumes the civil government of the State.

A singular contradiction is apparent here. Congress declares these local State governments
to be illegal governments, and then provides that these illegal governments shall be carried
on by Federal officers, who are to perform the very duties imposed on its own officers by this
illegal State authority. It certainly would be a novel spectacle if Congress should attempt
to carry on a legal State government by the agency of its own officers. It is yet more strange
that Congress attempts to sustain and carry on an illegal State government by the same Federal
agency.

In this connection I must call attention to the tenth and eleventh sections of the bill, which
provide that none of the officers or appointees of these military commanders "shall be bound
in his action by any opinion of any civil officer of the United States," and that all the provisions
of the act "shall be construed liberally, to the end that all the intents thereof may be fully
and perfectly carried out."

It seems Congress supposed that this bill might require construction, and they fix, therefore,
the rule to be applied. But where is the construction to come from? Certainly no one can be
more in want of instruction than a soldier or an officer of the Army detailed for a civil service,
perhaps the most important in a State, with the duties of which he is altogether unfamiliar.
This bill says he shall not be bound in his action by the opinion of any civil officer of the
United States. The duties of the office are altogether civil, but when he asks for an opinion
he can only ask the opinion of another military officer, who, perhaps, understands as little
of his duties as he does himself; and as to his "action," he is answerable to the military
authority, and to the military authority alone. Strictly, no opinion of any civil officer other
than a judge has a binding force.

But these military appointees would not be bound even by a judicial opinion. They might very
well say, even when their action is in conflict with the Supreme Court of the United States,
"That court is composed of civil officers of the United States, and we are not bound to conform
our action to any opinion of any such authority."

This bill and the acts to which it is supplementary are all founded upon the assumption that
these ten communities are not States and that their existing governments are not legal. Throughout
the legislation upon this subject they are called "rebel States," and in this particular bill
they are denominated "so-called States," and the vice of illegality is declared to pervade
all of them. The obligations of consistency bind a legislative body as well as the individuals
who compose it. It is now too late to say that these ten political communities are not States
of this Union. Declarations to the contrary made in these three acts are contradicted again
and again by repeated acts of legislation enacted by Congress from the year 1861 to the year 1867.

During that period, while these States were in actual rebellion, and after that rebellion was
brought to a close, they have been again and again recognized as States of the Union. Representation
has been apportioned to them as States. They have been divided into judicial districts for
the holding of district and circuit courts of the United States, as States of the Union only
can be districted. The last act on this subject was passed July 23, 1866, by which every one
of these ten States was arranged into districts and circuits.

They have been called upon by Congress to act through their legislatures upon at least two
amendments to the Constitution of the United States. As States they have ratified one amendment,
which required the vote of twenty-seven States of the thirty-six then composing the Union.
When the requisite twenty-seven votes were given in favor of that amendment--seven of which
votes were given by seven of these ten States--it was proclaimed to be a part of the Constitution
of the United States, and slavery was declared no longer to exist within the United States
or any place subject to their jurisdiction. If these seven States were not legal States of
the Union, it follows as an inevitable consequence that in some of the States slavery yet exists.
It does not exist in these seven States, for they have abolished it also in their State constitutions;
but Kentucky not having done so, it would still remain in that State. But, in truth, if this
assumption that these States have no legal State governments be true, then the abolition of
slavery by these illegal governments binds no one, for Congress now denies to these States
the power to abolish slavery by denying to them the power to elect a legal State legislature,
or to frame a constitution for any purpose, even for such a purpose as the abolition of slavery.

As to the other constitutional amendment, having reference to suffrage, it happens that these
States have not accepted it. The consequence is that it has never been proclaimed or understood,
even by Congress, to be a part of the Constitution of the United States. The Senate of the
United States has repeatedly given its sanction to the appointment of judges, district attorneys,
and marshals for every one of these States; yet, if they are not legal States, not one of these
judges is authorized to hold a court. So, too, both Houses of Congress have passed appropriation
bills to pay all these judges, attorneys, and officers of the United States for exercising
their functions in these States. Again, in the machinery of the internal-revenue laws all these
States are districted, not as "Territories," but as "States."

So much for continuous legislative recognition. The instances cited, however, fall far short
of all that might be enumerated. Executive recognition, as is well known, has been frequent
and unwavering. The same maybe said as to judicial recognition through the Supreme Court of
the United States. That august tribunal, from first to last, in the administration of its duties
in banc and upon the circuit, has never failed to recognize these ten communities as legal
States of the Union. The cases depending in that court upon appeal and writ of error from these
States when the rebellion began have not been dismissed upon any idea of the cessation of jurisdiction.
They were carefully continued from term to term until the rebellion was entirely subdued and
peace reestablished, and then they were called for argument and consideration as if no insurrection
had intervened. New cases, occurring since the rebellion, have come from these States before
that court by writ of error and appeal, and even by original suit, where only "a State" can
bring such a suit. These cases are entertained by that tribunal in the exercise of its acknowledged
jurisdiction, which could not attach to them if they had come from any political body other
than a State of the Union. Finally, in the allotment of their circuits made by the judges at
the December term, 1865, every one of these States is put on the same footing of legality with
all the other States of the Union. Virginia and North Carolina, being a part of the fourth
circuit, are allotted to the Chief Justice. South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
and Florida constitute the fifth circuit, and are allotted to the late Mr. Justice Wayne. Louisiana,
Arkansas, and Texas are allotted to the sixth judicial circuit, as to which there is a vacancy
on the bench.

The Chief Justice, in the exercise of his circuit duties, has recently held a circuit court
in the State of North Carolina. If North Carolina is not a State of this Union, the Chief Justice
had no authority to hold a court there, and every order, judgment, and decree rendered by him
in that court were coram non judice and void.

Another ground on which these reconstruction acts are attempted to be sustained is this: That
these ten States are conquered territory; that the constitutional relation in which they stood
as States toward the Federal Government prior to the rebellion has given place to a new relation;
that their territory is a conquered country and their citizens a conquered people, and that
in this new relation Congress can govern them by military power.

A title by conquest stands on clear ground; it is a new title acquired by war; it applies only
to territory; for goods or movable things regularly captured in war are called "booty," or,
if taken by individual soldiers, "plunder."

There is not a foot of the land in any one of these ten States which the United States holds
by conquest, save only such land as did not belong to either of these States or to any individual
owner. I mean such lands as did belong to the pretended government called the Confederate States.
These lands we may claim to hold by conquest. As to all other land or territory, whether belonging
to the States or to individuals, the Federal Government has now no more title or right to it
than it had before the rebellion. Our own forts, arsenals, navy-yards, custom-houses, and other
Federal property situate in those States we now hold, not by the title of conquest, but by
our old title, acquired by purchase or condemnation for public use, with compensation to former
owners. We have not conquered these places, but have simply "repossessed" them.

If we require more sites for forts, custom-houses, or other public use, we must acquire the
title to them by purchase or appropriation in the regular mode. At this moment the United States,
in the acquisition of sites for national cemeteries in these States, acquires title in the
same way. The Federal courts sit in court-houses owned or leased by the United States, not
in the court-houses of the States. The United States pays each of these States for the use
of its jails. Finally, the United States levies its direct taxes and its internal revenue upon
the property in these States, including the productions of the lands within their territorial
limits, not by way of levy and contribution in the character of a conqueror, but in the regular
way of taxation, under the same laws which apply to all the other States of the Union.

From first to last, during the rebellion and since, the title of each of these States to the
lands and public buildings owned by them has never been disturbed, and not a foot of it has
ever been acquired by the United States, even under a title by confiscation, and not a foot
of it has ever been taxed under Federal law.

In conclusion I must respectfully ask the attention of Congress to the consideration of one
more question arising under this bill. It vests in the military commander, subject only to
the approval of the General of the Army of the United States, an unlimited power to remove
from office any civil or military officer in each of these ten States, and the further power,
subject to the same approval, to detail or appoint any military officer or soldier of the United
States to perform the duties of the officer so removed, and to fill all vacancies occurring
in those States by death, resignation, or otherwise.

The military appointee thus required to perform the duties of a civil office according to the
laws of the State, and, as such, required to take an oath, is for the time being a civil officer.
What is his character? Is he a civil officer of the State or a civil officer of the United
States? If he is a civil officer of the State, where is the Federal power under our Constitution
which authorizes his appointment by any Federal officer? If, however, he is to be considered
a civil officer of the United States, as his appointment and oath would seem to indicate, where
is the authority for his appointment vested by the Constitution? The power of appointment of
all officers of the United States, civil or military, where not provided for in the Constitution,
is vested in the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, with this exception,
that Congress "may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper
in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of Departments." But this bill,
if these are to be considered inferior officers within the meaning of the Constitution, does
not provide for their appointment by the President alone, or by the courts of law, or by the
heads of Departments, but vests the appointment in one subordinate executive officer, subject
to the approval of another subordinate executive officer. So that, if we put this question
and fix the character of this military appointee either way, this provision of the bill is
equally opposed to the Constitution.

Take the case of a soldier or officer appointed to perform the office of judge in one of these
States, and, as such, to administer the proper laws of the State. Where is the authority to
be found in the Constitution for vesting in a military or an executive officer strict judicial
functions to be exercised under State law? It has been again and again decided by the Supreme
Court of the United States that acts of Congress which have attempted to vest executive powers
in the judicial courts or judges of the United States are not warranted by the Constitution.
If Congress can not clothe a judge with merely executive duties, how can they clothe an officer
or soldier of the Army with judicial duties over citizens of the United States who are not
in the military or naval service? So, too, it has been repeatedly decided that Congress can
not require a State officer, executive or judicial, to perform any duty enjoined upon him by
a law of the United States. How, then, can Congress confer power upon an executive officer
of the United States to perform such duties in a State? If Congress could not vest in a judge
of one of these States any judicial authority under the United States by direct enactment,
how can it accomplish the same thing indirectly, by removing the State judge and putting an
officer of the United States in his place?

To me these considerations are conclusive of the unconstitutionality of this part of the bill
now before me, and I earnestly commend their consideration to the deliberate judgment of Congress.

Within a period less than a year the legislation of Congress has attempted to strip the executive
department of the Government of some of its essential powers. The Constitution and the oath
provided in it devolve upon the President the power and duty to see that the laws are faithfully
executed. The Constitution, in order to carry out this power, gives him the choice of the agents,
and makes them subject to his control and supervision. But in the execution of these laws the
constitutional obligation upon the President remains, but the power to exercise that constitutional
duty is effectually taken away. The military commander is as to the power of appointment made
to take the place of the President, and the General of the Army the place of the Senate; and
any attempt on the part of the President to assert his own constitutional power may, under
pretense of law, be met by official insubordination. It is to be feared that these military
officers, looking to the authority given by these laws rather than to the letter of the Constitution,
will recognize no authority but the commander of the district and the General of the Army.

If there were no other objection than this to this proposed legislation, it would be sufficient.
Whilst I hold the chief executive authority of the United States, whilst the obligation rests
upon me to see that all the laws are faithfully executed, I can never willingly surrender that
trust or the powers given for its execution. I can never give my assent to be made responsible
for the faithful execution of laws, and at the same time surrender that trust and the powers
which accompany it to any other executive officer, high or low, or to any number of executive
officers. If this executive trust, vested by the Constitution in the President, is to be taken
from him and vested in a subordinate officer, the responsibility will be with Congress in clothing
the subordinate with unconstitutional power and with the officer who assumes its exercise.

This interference with the constitutional authority of the executive department is an evil
that will inevitably sap the foundations of our federal system; but it is not the worst evil
of this legislation. It is a great public wrong to take from the President powers conferred
on him alone by the Constitution, but the wrong is more flagrant and more dangerous when the
powers so taken from the President are conferred upon subordinate executive officers, and especially
upon military officers. Over nearly one-third of the States of the Union military power, regulated
by no fixed law, rules supreme. Each one of the five district commanders, though not chosen
by the people or responsible to them, exercises at this hour more executive power, military
and civil, than the people have ever been willing to confer upon the head of the executive
department, though chosen by and responsible to themselves. The remedy must come from the people
themselves. They know what it is and how it is to be applied. At the present time they can
not, according to the forms of the Constitution, repeal these laws; they can not remove or
control this military despotism. The remedy is, nevertheless, in their hands; it is to be found
in the ballot, and is a sure one if not controlled by fraud, overawed by arbitrary power, or,
from apathy on their part, too long delayed. With abiding confidence in their patriotism, wisdom,
and integrity, I am still hopeful of the future, and that in the end the rod of despotism will
be broken, the armed heel of power lifted from the necks of the people, and the principles
of a violated Constitution preserved.

Whereas it has been ascertained that in the nineteenth paragraph of the proclamation of the
President of the United States of the 20th of August, 1866, declaring the insurrection at an
end which had theretofore existed in the State of Texas, the previous proclamation of the 13th
of June, 1865, instead of that of the 2d day of April, 1866, was referred to:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby
declare and proclaim that the said words "13th of June, 1865," are to be regarded as erroneous
in the paragraph adverted to, and that the words "2d day of April, 1866," are to be considered
as substituted therefor.

A PROCLAMATION.

In conformity with a recent custom that may now be regarded as established on national consent
and approval, I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby recommend to my
fellow-citizens that Thursday, the 28th day of November next, be set apart and observed throughout
the Republic as a day of national thanksgiving and praise to the Almighty Ruler of Nations,
with whom are dominion and fear, who maketh peace in His high places.

Resting and refraining from secular labors on that day, let us reverently and devoutly give
thanks to our Heavenly Father for the mercies and blessings with which He has crowned the now
closing year. Especially let us remember that He has covered our land through all its extent
with greatly needed and very abundant harvests; that He has caused industry to prosper, not
only in our fields, but also in our workshops, in our mines, and in our forests. He has permitted
us to multiply ships upon our lakes and rivers and upon the high seas, and at the same time
to extend our iron roads so far into the secluded places of the continent as to guarantee speedy
overland intercourse between the two oceans. He has inclined our hearts to turn away from domestic
contentions and commotions consequent upon a distracting and desolating civil war, and to walk
more and more in the ancient ways of loyalty, conciliation, and brotherly love. He has blessed
the peaceful efforts with which we have established new and important commercial treaties with
foreign nations, while we have at the same time strengthened our national defenses and greatly
enlarged our national borders.

While thus rendering the unanimous and heartfelt tribute of national praise and thanksgiving
which is so justly due to Almighty God, let us not fail to implore Him that the same divine
protection and care which we have hitherto so undeservedly and yet so constantly enjoyed may
be continued to our country and our people throughout all their generations forever.

II. In pursuance of the act of Congress entitled "An act to provide for the more efficient
government of the rebel States," the President directs the following assignments to be made:

First District, State of Virginia, to be commanded by Brevet Major-General J.M. Schofield.
Headquarters, Richmond, Va.

Second District, consisting of North Carolina and South Carolina, to be commanded by Major-General
D.E. Sickles. Headquarters, Columbia, S.C.

Third District, consisting of the States of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, to be commanded
by Major-General G.H. Thomas. Headquarters, Montgomery, Ala.

Fourth District, consisting of the States of Mississippi and Arkansas, to be commanded by Brevet

Fifth District, consisting of the States of Louisiana and Texas, to be commanded by Major-General

The powers of departmental commanders are hereby delegated to the above-named district commanders.

The President directs that the following change be made, at the request of Major-General Thomas,
in the assignment announced in General Orders, No. 10, of March 11, 1867, of commanders of
districts, under the act of Congress entitled "An act to provide for the more efficient government
of the rebel States," and of the Department of the Cumberland, created in General Orders, No.
14, of March 12, 1867:

Brevet Major-General John Pope to command the Third District, consisting of the States of Georgia,
Florida, and Alabama; and Major-General George H. Thomas to command the Department of the Cumberland

By command of General Grant:

E.D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,
  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,
    Washington, June 20, 1867.

Whereas several commanders of military districts created by the acts of Congress known as the
reconstruction acts have expressed doubts as to the proper construction thereof and in respect
to some of their powers and duties under said acts, and have applied to the Executive for information
in relation thereto; and

Whereas the said acts of Congress have been referred to the Attorney-General for his opinion
thereon, and the said acts and the opinion of the Attorney-General have been fully and carefully
considered by the President in conference with the heads of the respective Departments:

The President accepts the following as a practical interpretation of the aforesaid acts of
Congress on the points therein presented, and directs the same to be transmitted to the respective
military commanders for their information, in order that there may be uniformity in the execution
of said acts:

1. The oath prescribed in the supplemental act defines all the qualifications required, and
every person who can take that oath is entitled to have his name entered upon the list of voters.

2. The board of registration have no authority to administer any other oath to the person applying
for registration than this prescribed oath, nor to administer an oath to any other person touching
the qualifications of the applicant or the falsity of the oath so taken by him. The act, to
guard against falsity in the oath, provides that if false the person taking it shall be tried
and punished for perjury.

No provision is made for challenging the qualifications of the applicant or entering upon any
trial or investigation of his qualifications, either by witnesses or any other form of proof.

3. As to citizenship and residence:

The applicant for registration must be a citizen of the State and of the United States, and
must be a resident of a county or parish included in the election district. He may be registered
if he has been such citizen for a period less than twelve months at the time he applies for
registration, but he can not vote at any election unless his citizenship has then extended
to the full term of one year. As to such a person, the exact length of his citizenship should
be noted opposite his name on the list, so that it may appear on the day of election, upon
reference to the list, whether the full term has then been accomplished.

4. An unnaturalized person can not take this oath, but an alien who has been naturalized can
take it, and no other proof of naturalization can be required from him.

5. No one who is not 21 years of age at the time of registration can take the oath, for he
must swear that he has then attained that age.

6. No one who has been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion against the United
States or for felony committed against the laws of any State or of the United States can take
this oath.

The actual participation in a rebellion or the actual commission of a felony does not amount
to disfranchisement. The sort of disfranchisement here meant is that which is declared by law
passed by competent authority, or which has been fixed upon the criminal by the sentence of
the court which tried him for the crime.

No law of the United States has declared the penalty of disfranchisement for participation
in rebellion alone; nor is it known that any such law exists in either of these ten States,
except, perhaps, Virginia, as to which State special instructions will be given.

7. As to disfranchisement arising from having held office followed by participation in rebellion:

This is the most important part of the oath, and requires strict attention to arrive at its
meaning.

Two elements must concur in order to disqualify a person under these clauses: First, the office
and official oath to support the Constitution of the United States; second, engaging afterwards
in rebellion. Both must exist to work disqualification, and must happen in the order of time
mentioned.

A person who has held an office and taken the oath to support the Federal Constitution and
has not afterwards engaged in rebellion is not disqualified. So, too, a person who has engaged
in rebellion, but has not theretofore held an office and taken that oath, is not disqualified.

8. Officers of the United States:

As to these the language is without limitation. The person who has at any time prior to the
rebellion held an office, civil or military, under the United States, and has taken an official
oath to support the Constitution of the United States, is subject to disqualification.

9. Militia officers of any State prior to the rebellion are not subject to disqualification.

10. Municipal officers--that is to say, officers of incorporated cities, towns, and villages,
such as mayors, aldermen, town council, police, and other city or town officers--are not subject
to disqualification.

11. Persons who have prior to the rebellion been members of the Congress of the United States
or members of a State legislature are subject to disqualification, but those who have been
members of conventions framing or amending the Constitution of a State prior to the rebellion
are not subject to disqualification.

12. All the executive or judicial officers of any State who took an oath to support the Constitution
of the United States are subject to disqualification, including county officers. They are subject
to disqualification if they were required to take as a part of their official oath the oath
to support the Constitution of the United States.

13. Persons who exercised mere employment under State authority are not disqualified; such
as commissioners to lay out roads, commissioners of public works, visitors of State institutions,
directors of State institutions, examiners of banks, notaries public, and commissioners to
take acknowledgments of deeds.

ENGAGING IN REBELLION.

Having specified what offices held by anyone prior to the rebellion come within the meaning
of the law, it is necessary next to set forth what subsequent conduct fixes upon such person
the offense of engaging in rebellion. Two things must exist as to any person to disqualify
him from voting: First, the office held prior to the rebellion, and, afterwards, participation
in the rebellion.

14. An act to fix upon a person the offense of engaging in the rebellion under this law must
be an overt and voluntary act, done with the intent of aiding or furthering the common unlawful
purpose. A person forced into the rebel service by conscription or under a paramount authority
which he could not safely disobey, and who would not have entered such service if left to the
free exercise of his own will, can not be held to be disqualified from voting.

15. Mere acts of charity, where the intent is to relieve the wants of the object of such charity,
and not done in aid of the cause in which he may have been engaged, do not disqualify; but
organized contributions of food and clothing for the general relief of persons engaged in the
rebellion, and not of a merely sanitary character, but contributed to enable them to perform
their unlawful object, may be classed with acts which do disqualify.

Forced contributions to the rebel cause in the form of taxes or military assessments, which
a person was compelled to pay or contribute, do not disqualify; but voluntary contributions
to the rebel cause, even such indirect contributions as arise from the voluntary loan of money
to rebel authorities or purchase of bonds or securities created to afford the means of carrying
on the rebellion, will work disqualification.

16. All those who in legislative or other official capacity were engaged in the furtherance
of the common unlawful purpose, where the duties of the office necessarily had relation to
the support of the rebellion, such as members of the rebel conventions, congresses, and legislatures,
diplomatic agents of the rebel Confederacy, and other officials whose offices were created
for the purpose of more effectually carrying on hostilities or whose duties appertained to
the support of the rebel cause, must be held to be disqualified.

But officers who during the rebellion discharged official duties not incident to war, but only
such duties as belong even to a state of peace and were necessary to the preservation of order
and the administration of law, are not to be considered as thereby engaging in rebellion or
as disqualified. Disloyal sentiments, opinions, or sympathies would not disqualify, but where
a person has by speech or by writing incited others to engage in rebellion he must come under
the disqualification.

17. The duties of the board appointed to superintend the elections:

This board, having the custody of the list of registered voters in the district for which it
is constituted, must see that the name of the person offering to vote is found upon the registration
list, and if such proves to be the fact it is the duty of the board to receive his vote if
then qualified by residence. They can not receive the vote of any person whose name is not
upon the list, though he may be ready to take the registration oath, and although he may satisfy
them that he was unable to have his name registered at the proper time, in consequence of absence,
sickness, or other cause.

The board can not enter into any inquiry as to the qualifications of any person whose name
is not on the registration list, or as to the qualifications of any person whose name is on
the list.

18. The mode of voting is provided in the act to be by ballot. The board will keep a record
and poll book of the election, showing the votes, list of voters, and the persons elected by
a plurality of the votes cast at the election, and make returns of these to the commanding
general of the district.

19. The board appointed for registration and for superintending the elections must take the
oath prescribed by the act of Congress approved July 2, 1862, entitled "An act to prescribe
an oath of office."

By order of the President:

Assistant Adjutant-General.

THIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

SPECIAL MESSAGES.

WASHINGTON, December 3, 1867.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 3, 1867. This instrument has been framed pursuant to the amendments of
the Senate of the United States to the previous treaty between the parties of the 16th of March,
1859.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 4, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

I transmit herewith a final report from the Attorney-General, additional to the reports submitted
by him December 31, 1866, March 2, 1867, and July 8, 1867, in reply to a resolution of the
House of Representatives December 10, 1866, requesting "a list of the names of all persons
engaged in the late rebellion against the United States Government who have been pardoned by
the President from April 15, 1865, to this date; that said list shall also state the rank of
each person who has been so pardoned, if he has been engaged in the military service of the
so-called Confederate government, and the position if he shall have held any civil office under
said so-called Confederate government; and shall also state whether such person has at anytime
prior to April 14, 1861, held any office under the United States Government, and, if so, what
office, together with the reason for granting such pardon, and also the names of the person
or persons at whose solicitation such pardon was granted."

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 4, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the 26th ultimo, a report[30] from
the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

[Footnote 30: Relating to the removal of J. Lothrop Motley from his post as minister of the
United States at Vienna.]

WASHINGTON, December 5, 1867.

To the House of Representatives:

In compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th July last, requesting
me to communicate all information received at the several Departments of the Government touching
the organization within or near the territory of the United States of armed bodies of men for
the purpose of avenging the death of the Archduke Maximilian or of intervening in Mexican affairs,
and what measures have been taken to prevent the organization or departure of such organized
bodies for the purpose of carrying out such objects, I transmit a report from the Secretary
of State and the papers accompanying it.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 5, 1867.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 10, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the 25th ultimo, a report[31] from
the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

[Footnote 31: Relating to the formation and the functions of the Government of the united States
of North Germany.]

WASHINGTON, December 10, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit a copy of a dispatch of the 17th of July last, addressed to the Secretary of State,
and of the papers which accompanied it, from Anson Burlingame, esq., minister of the United
States to China, relating to a proposed modification of the existing treaty between this Government
and that of China.

The Senate is aware that the original treaty is chiefly ex parte in its character. The proposed
modification, though not of sufficient importance to warrant all the usual forms, does not
seem to be objectionable; but it can not be legally accepted by the executive government without
the advice and consent of the Senate. If this should be given, it may be indicated by a resolution,
upon the adoption of which the United States minister to China will be instructed to inform
the Government of that country that the modification has been assented to.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 12, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

On the 12th of August last I suspended Mr. Stanton from the exercise of the office of Secretary
of War, and on the same day designated General Grant to act as Secretary of War ad interim.

The following are copies of the Executive orders:

  EXECUTIVE MANSION,
    Washington, August 12, 1867.

  Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,
    Secretary of War.

  SIR: By virtue of the power and authority vested in me as President by
  the Constitution and laws of the United States, you are hereby suspended
  from office as Secretary of War, and will cease to exercise any and all
  functions pertaining to the same.

  You will at once transfer to General Ulysses S. Grant, who has this day
  been authorized and empowered to act as Secretary of War ad interim,
  all records, books, and other property now in your custody and charge.

  EXECUTIVE MANSION,
    Washington, D.C., August 12, 1867.

  General ULYSSES S. GRANT,
    Washington, D.C.

  SIR: The Hon. Edwin M. Stanton having been this day suspended as
  Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized and empowered to act as
  Secretary of War ad interim, and will at once enter upon the discharge
  of the duties of the office.

  The Secretary of War has been instructed to transfer to you all the
  records, books, papers, and other public property now in his custody and
  charge.

The following communication was received from Mr. Stanton:

  WAR DEPARTMENT,
    Washington City, August 12, 1867.

  The PRESIDENT.

  SIR: Your note of this date has been received, informing me that by
  virtue of the powers and authority vested in you as President by the
  Constitution and laws of the United States I am suspended from office
  as Secretary of War, and will cease to exercise any and all functions
  pertaining to the same, and also directing me at once to transfer to
  General Ulysses S. Grant, who has this day been authorized and empowered
  to act as Secretary of War ad interim, all records, books, papers, and
  other public property now in my custody and charge.

  Under a sense of public duty I am compelled to deny your right under
  the Constitution and laws of the United States, without the advice and
  consent of the Senate and without any legal cause, to suspend me from
  office as Secretary of War or the exercise of any or all functions
  pertaining to the same, or without such advice and consent to compel
  me to transfer to any person the records, books, papers, and public
  property in my custody as Secretary.

  But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States
  has been appointed ad interim, and has notified me that he has
  accepted the appointment, I have no alternative but to submit, under
  protest, to superior force.

The suspension has not been revoked, and the business of the War Department is conducted by
the Secretary ad interim.

Prior to the date of this suspension I had come to the conclusion that the time had arrived
when it was proper Mr. Stanton should retire from my Cabinet. The mutual confidence and general
accord which should exist in such a relation had ceased. I supposed that Mr. Stanton was well
advised that his continuance in the Cabinet was contrary to my wishes, for I had repeatedly
given him so to understand by every mode short of an express request that he should resign.
Having waited full time for the voluntary action of Mr. Stanton, and seeing no manifestation
on his part of an intention to resign, I addressed him the following note on the 5th of August:

  SIR: Public considerations of a high character constrain me to say
  that your resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted.

To this note I received the following reply:

  WAR DEPARTMENT,
    Washington, August 5, 1867.

  SIR: Your note of this day has been received, stating that public
  considerations of a high character constrain you to say that my
  resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted.

  In reply I have the honor to say that public considerations of a high
  character, which alone have induced me to continue at the head of this
  Department, constrain me not to resign the office of Secretary of War
  before the next meeting of Congress.

This reply of Mr. Stanton was not merely a disinclination of compliance with the request for
his resignation; it was a defiance, and something more. Mr. Stanton does not content himself
with assuming that public considerations bearing upon his continuance in office form as fully
a rule of action for himself as for the President, and that upon so delicate a question as
the fitness of an officer for continuance in his office the officer is as competent and as
impartial to decide as his superior, who is responsible for his conduct. But he goes further,
and plainly intimates what he means by "public considerations of a high character," and this
is nothing else than his loss of confidence in his superior. He says that these public considerations
have "alone induced me to continue at the head of this Department," and that they "constrain
me not to resign the office of Secretary of War before the next meeting of Congress."

This language is very significant. Mr. Stanton holds the position unwillingly. He continues
in office only under a sense of high public duty. He is ready to leave when it is safe to leave,
and as the danger he apprehends from his removal then will not exist when Congress is here,
he is constrained to remain during the interim. What, then, is that danger which can only be
averted by the presence of Mr. Stanton or of Congress? Mr. Stanton does not say that "public
considerations of a high character" constrain him to hold on to the office indefinitely. He
does not say that no one other than himself can at any time be found to take his place and
perform its duties. On the contrary, he expresses a desire to leave the office at the earliest
moment consistent with these high public considerations. He says, in effect, that while Congress
is away he must remain, but that when Congress is here he can go. In other words, he has lost
confidence in the President. He is unwilling to leave the War Department in his hands or in
the hands of anyone the President may appoint or designate to perform its duties. If he resigns,
the President may appoint a Secretary of War that Mr. Stanton does not approve; therefore he
will not resign. But when Congress is in session the President can not appoint a Secretary
of War which the Senate does not approve; consequently when Congress meets Mr. Stanton is ready
to resign.

Whatever cogency these "considerations" may have had on Mr. Stanton, whatever right he may
have had to entertain such considerations, whatever propriety there might be in the expression
of them to others, one thing is certain, it was official misconduct, to say the least of it,
to parade them before his superior officer.

Upon the receipt of this extraordinary note I only delayed the order of suspension long enough
to make the necessary arrangements to fill the office. If this were the only cause for his
suspension, it would be ample. Necessarily it must end our most important official relations,
for I can not imagine a degree of effrontery which would embolden the head of a Department
to take his seat at the council table in the Executive Mansion after such an act; nor can I
imagine a President so forgetful of the proper respect and dignity which belong to his office
as to submit to such intrusion. I will not do Mr. Stanton the wrong to suppose that he entertained
any idea of offering to act as one of my constitutional advisers after that note was written.
There was an interval of a week between that date and the order of suspension, during which
two Cabinet meetings were held. Mr. Stanton did not present himself at either, nor was he expected.

On the 12th of August Mr. Stanton was notified of his suspension and that General Grant had
been authorized to take charge of the Department. In his answer to this notification, of the
same date, Mr. Stanton expresses himself as follows:

  Under a sense of public duty I am compelled to deny your right under
  the Constitution and laws of the United States, without the advice and
  consent of the Senate and without any legal cause, to suspend me from
  office as Secretary of War or the exercise of any or all functions
  pertaining to the same, or without such advice and consent to compel
  me to transfer to any person the records, books, papers, and public
  property in my custody as Secretary.

  But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States
  has been appointed ad interim, and has notified me that he has
  accepted the appointment, I have no alternative but to submit, under
  protest, to superior force.

It will not escape attention that in his note of August 5 Mr. Stanton stated that he had been
constrained to continue in the office, even before he was requested to resign, by considerations
of a high public character. In this note of August 12 a new and different sense of public duty
compels him to deny the President's right to suspend him from office without the consent of
the Senate. This last is the public duty of resisting an act contrary to law, and he charges
the President with violation of the law in ordering his suspension.

Mr. Stanton refers generally to the Constitution and laws of the "United States," and says
that a sense of public duty "under" these compels him to deny the right of the President to
suspend him from office. As to his sense of duty under the Constitution, that will be considered
in the sequel. As to his sense of duty under "the laws of the United States," he certainly
can not refer to the law which creates the War Department, for that expressly confers upon
the President the unlimited right to remove the head of the Department. The only other law
bearing upon the question is the tenure-of-office act, passed by Congress over the Presidential
veto March 2, 1867. This is the law which, under a sense of public duty, Mr. Stanton volunteers
to defend.

There is no provision in this law which compels any officer coming within its provisions to
remain in office. It forbids removals--not resignations. Mr. Stanton was perfectly free to
resign at any moment, either upon his own motion or in compliance with a request or an order.
It was a matter of choice or of taste. There was nothing compulsory in the nature of legal
obligation. Nor does he put his action upon that imperative ground. He says he acts under a
"sense of public duty," not of legal obligation, compelling him to hold on and leaving him
no choice. The public duty which is upon him arises from the respect which he owes to the Constitution
and the laws, violated in his own case. He is therefore compelled by this sense of public duty
to vindicate violated law and to stand as its champion.

This was not the first occasion in which Mr. Stanton, in discharge of a public duty, was called
upon to consider the provisions of that law. That tenure-of-office law did not pass without
notice. Like other acts, it was sent to the President for approval. As is my custom, I submitted
its consideration to my Cabinet for their advice upon the question whether I should approve
it or not. It was a grave question of constitutional law, in which I would, of course, rely
most upon the opinion of the Attorney-General and of Mr. Stanton, who had once been Attorney-General.

Every member of my Cabinet advised me that the proposed law was unconstitutional. All spoke
without doubt or reservation, but Mr. Stanton's condemnation of the law was the most elaborate
and emphatic. He referred to the constitutional provisions, the debates in Congress, especially
to the speech of Mr. Buchanan when a Senator, to the decisions of the Supreme Court, and to
the usage from the beginning of the Government through every successive Administration, all
concurring to establish the right of removal as vested by the Constitution in the President.
To all these he added the weight of his own deliberate judgment, and advised me that it was
my duty to defend the power of the President from usurpation and to veto the law.

I do not know when a sense of public duty is more imperative upon a head of Department than
upon such an occasion as this. He acts then under the gravest obligations of law, for when
he is called upon by the President for advice it is the Constitution which speaks to him. All
his other duties are left by the Constitution to be regulated by statute, but this duty was
deemed so momentous that it is imposed by the Constitution itself.

After all this I was not prepared for the ground taken by Mr. Stanton in his note of August
12. I was not prepared to find him compelled by a new and indefinite sense of public duty,
under "the Constitution," to assume the vindication of a law which, under the solemn obligations
of public duty imposed by the Constitution itself, he advised me was a violation of that Constitution.
I make great allowance for a change of opinion, but such a change as this hardly falls within
the limits of greatest indulgence.

Where our opinions take the shape of advice, and influence the action of others, the utmost
stretch of charity will scarcely justify us in repudiating them when they come to be applied
to ourselves.

But to proceed with the narrative. I was so much struck with the full mastery of the question
manifested by Mr. Stanton, and was at the time so fully occupied with the preparation of another
veto upon the pending reconstruction act, that I requested him to prepare the veto upon this
tenure-of-office bill. This he declined, on the ground of physical disability to undergo at
the time the labor of writing, but stated his readiness to furnish what aid might be required
in the preparation of materials for the paper.

At the time this subject was before the Cabinet it seemed to be taken for granted that as to
those members of the Cabinet who had been appointed by Mr. Lincoln their tenure of office was
not fixed by the provisions of the act. I do not remember that the point was distinctly decided,
but I well recollect that it was suggested by one member of the Cabinet who was appointed by
Mr. Lincoln, and that no dissent was expressed.

Whether the point was well taken or not did not seem to me of any consequence, for the unanimous
expression of opinion against the constitutionality and policy of the act was so decided that
I felt no concern, so far as the act had reference to the gentlemen then present, that I would
be embarrassed in the future. The bill had not then become a law. The limitation upon the power
of removal was not yet imposed, and there was yet time to make any changes. If any one of these
gentlemen had then said to me that he would avail himself of the provisions of that bill in
case it became a law, I should not have hesitated a moment as to his removal. No pledge was
then expressly given or required. But there are circumstances when to give an expressed pledge
is not necessary, and when to require it is an imputation of possible bad faith. I felt that
if these gentlemen came within the purview of the bill it was as to them a dead letter, and
that none of them would ever take refuge under its provisions.

I now pass to another subject. When, on the 15th of April, 1865, the duties of the Presidential
office devolved upon me, I found a full Cabinet of seven members, all of them selected by Mr.
Lincoln. I made no change. On the contrary, I shortly afterwards ratified a change determined
upon by Mr. Lincoln, but not perfected at his death, and admitted his appointee, Mr. Harlan,
in the place of Mr. Usher, who was in office at the time.

The great duty of the time was to reestablish government, law, and order in the insurrectionary
States. Congress was then in recess, and the sudden overthrow of the rebellion required speedy
action. This grave subject had engaged the attention of Mr. Lincoln in the last days of his
life, and the plan according to which it was to be managed had been prepared and was ready
for adoption. A leading feature of that plan was that it should be carried out by the Executive
authority, for, so far as I have been informed, neither Mr. Lincoln nor any member of his Cabinet
doubted his authority to act or proposed to call an extra session of Congress to do the work.
The first business transacted in Cabinet after I became President was this unfinished business
of my predecessor. A plan or scheme of reconstruction was produced which had been prepared
for Mr. Lincoln by Mr. Stanton, his Secretary of War. It was approved, and at the earliest
moment practicable was applied in the form of a proclamation to the State of North Carolina,
and afterwards became the basis of action in turn for the other States.

Upon the examination of Mr. Stanton before the Impeachment Committee he was asked the following
question:

  Did any one of the Cabinet express a doubt of the power of the executive
  branch of the Government to reorganize State governments which had been
  in rebellion without the aid of Congress?

He answered:

  None whatever. I had myself entertained no doubt of the authority of the
  President to take measures for the organization of the rebel States on
  the plan proposed during the vacation of Congress and agreed in the plan
  specified in the proclamation in the case of North Carolina.

There is perhaps no act of my Administration for which I have been more denounced than this.
It was not originated by me, but I shrink from no responsibility on that account, for the plan
approved itself to my own judgment, and I did not hesitate to carry it into execution.

Thus far and upon this vital policy there was perfect accord between the Cabinet and myself,
and I saw no necessity for a change. As time passed on there was developed an unfortunate difference
of opinion and of policy between Congress and the President upon this same subject and upon
the ultimate basis upon which the reconstruction of these States should proceed, especially
upon the question of negro suffrage. Upon this point three members of the Cabinet found themselves
to be in sympathy with Congress. They remained only long enough to see that the difference
of policy could not be reconciled. They felt that they should remain no longer, and a high
sense of duty and propriety constrained them to resign their positions. We parted with mutual
respect for the sincerity of each other in opposite opinions, and mutual regret that the difference
was on points so vital as to require a severance of official relations. This was in the summer
of 1866. The subsequent sessions of Congress developed new complications, when the suffrage
bill for the District of Columbia and the reconstruction acts of March 2 and March 23, 1867,
all passed over the veto. It was in Cabinet consultations upon these bills that a difference
of opinion upon the most vital points was developed. Upon these questions there was perfect
accord between all the members of the Cabinet and myself, except Mr. Stanton. He stood alone,
and the difference of opinion could not be reconciled. That unity of opinion which, upon great
questions of public policy or administration, is so essential to the Executive was gone.

I do not claim that a head of Department should have no other opinions than those of the President.
He has the same right, in the conscientious discharge of duty, to entertain and express his
own opinions as has the President. What I do claim is that the President is the responsible
head of the Administration, and when the opinions of a head of Department are irreconcilably
opposed to those of the President in grave matters of policy and administration there is but
one result which can solve the difficulty, and that is a severance of the official relation.
This in the past history of the Government has always been the rule, and it is a wise one,
for such differences of opinion among its members must impair the efficiency of any Administration.

I have now referred to the general grounds upon which the withdrawal or Mr. Stanton from my
Administration seemed to me to be proper and necessary, but I can not omit to state a special
ground, which, if it stood alone, would vindicate my action.

The sanguinary riot which occurred in the city of New Orleans on the 30th of August, 1866,
justly aroused public indignation and public inquiry, not only as to those who were engaged
in it, but as to those who, more or less remotely, might be held to responsibility for its
occurrence. I need not remind the Senate of the effort made to fix that responsibility on the
President. The charge was openly made, and again and again reiterated all through the land,
that the President was warned in time, but refused to interfere.

By telegrams from the lieutenant-governor and attorney-general of Louisiana, dated the 27th
and 28th of August, I was advised that a body of delegates claiming to be a constitutional
convention were about to assemble in New Orleans; that the matter was before the grand jury,
but that it would be impossible to execute civil process without a riot; and this question
was asked:

  Is the military to interfere to prevent process of court?

This question was asked at a time when the civil courts were in the full exercise of their
authority, and the answer sent by telegraph on the same 28th of August was this:

  The military will be expected to sustain, and not to interfere with,
  the proceedings of the courts.

On the same 28th of August the following telegram was sent to Mr. Stanton by Major-General
Baird, then (owing to the absence of General Sheridan) in command of the military at New Orleans:

  Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,
    Secretary of War:

  A convention has been called, with the sanction of Governor Wells, to
  meet here on Monday. The lieutenant-governor and city authorities think
  it unlawful, and propose to break it up by arresting the delegates.
  I have given no orders on the subject, but have warned the parties that
  I could not countenance or permit such action without instructions to
  that effect from the President. Please instruct me at once by telegraph.

The 28th of August was on Saturday. The next morning, the 29th, this dispatch was received
by Mr. Stanton at his residence in this city. He took no action upon it, and neither sent instructions
to General Baird himself nor presented it to me for such instructions. On the next day (Monday)
the riot occurred. I never saw this dispatch from General Baird until some ten days or two
weeks after the riot, when, upon my call for all the dispatches, with a view to their publication,
Mr. Stanton sent it to me.

These facts all appear in the testimony of Mr. Stanton before the Judiciary Committee in the
impeachment investigation.

On the 30th, the day of the riot, and after it was suppressed, General Baird wrote to Mr. Stanton
a long letter, from which I make the following extract:

  SIR: I have the honor to inform you that a very serious riot has
  occurred here to-day. I had not been applied to by the convention
  for protection, but the lieutenant-governor and the mayor had freely
  consulted with me, and I was so fully convinced that it was so strongly
  the intent of the city authorities to preserve the peace, in order to
  prevent military interference, that I did not regard an outbreak as a
  thing to be apprehended. The lieutenant-governor had assured me that
  even if a writ of arrest was issued by the court the sheriff would not
  attempt to serve it without my permission, and for to-day they designed
  to suspend it. I inclose herewith copies of my correspondence with the
  mayor and of a dispatch which the lieutenant-governor claims to have
  received from the President. I regret that no reply to my dispatch to
  you of Saturday has yet reached me. General Sheridan is still absent
  in Texas.

The dispatch of General Baird of the 28th asks for immediate instructions, and his letter of
the 30th, after detailing the terrible riot which had just happened, ends with the expression
of regret that the instructions which he asked for were not sent. It is not the fault or the
error or the omission of the President that this military commander was left without instructions;
but for all omissions, for all errors, for all failures to instruct when instruction might
have averted this calamity, the President was openly and persistently held responsible. Instantly,
without waiting for proof, the delinquency of the President was heralded in every form of utterance.
Mr. Stanton knew then that the President was not responsible for this delinquency. The exculpation
was in his power, but it was not given by him to the public, and only to the President in obedience
to a requisition for all the dispatches.

No one regrets more than myself that General Baird's request was not brought to my notice.
It is clear from his dispatch and letter that if the Secretary of War had given him proper
instructions the riot which arose on the assembling of the convention would have been averted.

There may be those ready to say that I would have given no instructions even if the dispatch
had reached me in time, but all must admit that I ought to have had the opportunity.

The following is the testimony given by Mr. Stanton before the impeachment investigation committee
as to this dispatch:

  Q. Referring to the dispatch of the 28th of July by General Baird, I ask
  you whether that dispatch on its receipt was communicated?

  A. I received that dispatch on Sunday forenoon. I examined it carefully,
  and considered the question presented. I did not see that I could give
  any instructions different from the line of action which General Baird
  proposed, and made no answer to the dispatch.

  Q. I see it stated that this was received at 10.20 p.m. Was that the
  hour at which it was received by you?

  A. That is the date of its reception in the telegraph office Saturday
  night. I received it on Sunday forenoon at my residence. A copy of the
  dispatch was furnished to the President several days afterwards, along
  with all the other dispatches and communications on that subject, but it
  was not furnished by me before that time. I suppose it may have been ten
  or fifteen days afterwards.

  Q. The President himself being in correspondence with those parties upon
  the same subject, would it not have been proper to have advised him of
  the reception of that dispatch?

  A. I know nothing about his correspondence, and know nothing about any
  correspondence except this one dispatch. We had intelligence of the riot
  on Thursday morning. The riot had taken place on Monday.

It is a difficult matter to define all the relations which exist between the heads of Departments
and the President. The legal relations are well enough defined. The Constitution places these
officers in the relation of his advisers when he calls upon them for advice. The acts of Congress
go further. Take, for example, the act of 1789 creating the War Department.

Provision is also made for the appointment of an inferior officer by the head of the Department,
to be called the chief clerk, "who, whenever said principal officer shall be removed from office
by the President of the United States," shall have the charge and custody of the books, records,
and papers of the Department.

The legal relation is analogous to that of principal and agent. It is the President upon whom
the Constitution devolves, as head of the executive department, the duty to see that the laws
are faithfully executed; but as he can not execute them in person, he is allowed to select
his agents, and is made responsible for their acts within just limits. So complete is this
presumed delegation of authority in the relation of a head of Department to the President that
the Supreme Court of the United States have decided that an order made by a head of Department
is presumed to be made by the President himself.

The principal, upon whom such responsibility is placed for the acts of a subordinate, ought
to be left as free as possible in the matter of selection and of dismissal. To hold him to
responsibility for an officer beyond his control; to leave the question of the fitness of such
an agent to be decided for him and not by him; to allow such a subordinate, when the President,
moved by "public considerations of a high character," requests his resignation, to assume for
himself an equal right to act upon his own views of "public considerations" and to make his
own conclusions paramount to those of the President--to allow all this is to reverse the just
order of administration and to place the subordinate above the superior.

There are, however, other relations between the President and a head of Department beyond these
defined legal relations, which necessarily attend them, though not expressed. Chief among these
is mutual confidence. This relation is so delicate that it is sometimes hard to say when or
how it ceases. A single flagrant act may end it at once, and then there is no difficulty. But
confidence may be just as effectually destroyed by a series of causes too subtle for demonstration.
As it is a plant of slow growth, so, too, it may be slow in decay. Such has been the process
here. I will not pretend to say what acts or omissions have broken up this relation. They are
hardly susceptible of statement, and still less of formal proof. Nevertheless, no one can read
the correspondence of the 5th of August without being convinced that this relation was effectually
gone on both sides, and that while the President was unwilling to allow Mr. Stanton to remain
in his Administration, Mr. Stanton was equally unwilling to allow the President to carry on
his Administration without his presence.

In the great debate which took place in the House of Representatives in 1789, in the first
organization of the principal Departments, Mr. Madison spoke as follows:

  It is evidently the intention of the Constitution that the first
  magistrate should be responsible for the executive department. So far,
  therefore, as we do not make the officers who are to aid him in the
  duties of that department responsible to him, he is not responsible
  to the country. Again: Is there no danger that an officer, when he is
  appointed by the concurrence of the Senate and has friends in that body,
  may choose rather to risk his establishment on the favor of that branch
  than rest it upon the discharge of his duties to the satisfaction of the
  executive branch, which is constitutionally authorized to inspect and
  control his conduct? And if it should happen that the officers connect
  themselves with the Senate, they may mutually support each other, and
  for want of efficacy reduce the power of the President to a mere
  vapor, in which case his responsibility would be annihilated, and the
  expectation of it is unjust. The high executive officers, joined in
  cabal with the Senate, would lay the foundation of discord, and end in
  an assumption of the executive power only to be removed by a revolution
  in the Government.

Mr. Sedgwick, in the same debate, referring to the proposition that a head of Department should
only be removed or suspended by the concurrence of the Senate, used this language:

  But if proof be necessary, what is then the consequence? Why, in nine
  cases out of ten, where the case is very clear to the mind of the
  President that the man ought to be removed, the effect can not be
  produced, because it is absolutely impossible to produce the necessary
  evidence. Are the Senate to proceed without evidence? Some gentlemen
  contend not. Then the object will be lost. Shall a man under these
  circumstances be saddled upon the President who has been appointed for
  no other purpose but to aid the President in performing certain duties?
  Shall he be continued, I ask again, against the will of the President?
  If he is, where is the responsibility? Are you to look for it in the
  President, who has no control over the officer, no power to remove him
  if he acts unfeelingly or unfaithfully? Without you make him responsible
  you weaken and destroy the strength and beauty of your system. What is
  to be done in cases which can only be known from a long acquaintance
  with the conduct of an officer?

I had indulged the hope that upon the assembling of Congress Mr. Stanton would have ended this
unpleasant complication according to his intimation given in his note of August 12. The duty
which I have felt myself called upon to perform was by no means agreeable, but I feel that
I am not responsible for the controversy or for the consequences.

Unpleasant as this necessary change in my Cabinet has been to me upon personal considerations,
I have the consolation to be assured that so far as the public interests are involved there
is no cause for regret.

Salutary reforms have been introduced by the Secretary ad interim, and great reductions of
expenses have been effected under his administration of the War Department, to the saving of
millions to the Treasury.

To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit, for the consideration of the Senate, an agreement between the diplomatic representatives
of certain foreign powers in Japan, including the minister of the United States, on the one
part, and plenipotentiaries on the part of the Japanese Government, relative to the settlement
of Yokohama.

This instrument can not be legally binding upon the United States unless sanctioned by the
Senate. There appears to be no objection to its approval.

A copy of General Van Valkenburgh's dispatch to the Secretary of State, by which the agreement
was accompanied, and of the map to which it refers, are also herewith transmitted.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., December 18, 1867.

Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:

An official copy of the order issued by Major-General Winfield S. Hancock, commander of the
Fifth Military District, dated headquarters in New Orleans, La., on the 29th day of November,
has reached me through the regular channels of the War Department, and I herewith communicate
it to Congress for such action as may seem to be proper in view of all the circumstances.

It will be perceived that General Hancock announces that he will make the law the rule of his
conduct; that he will uphold the courts and other civil authorities in the performance of their
proper duties, and that he will use his military power only to preserve the peace and enforce
the law. He declares very explicitly that the sacred right of the trial by jury and the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be crushed out or trodden under foot. He goes further,
and in one comprehensive sentence asserts that the principles of American liberty are still
the inheritance of this people and ever should be.

When a great soldier, with unrestricted power in his hands to oppress his fellow-men, voluntarily
foregoes the chance of gratifying his selfish ambition and devotes himself to the duty of building
up the liberties and strengthening the laws of his country, he presents an example of the highest
public virtue that human nature is capable of practicing. The strongest claim of Washington
to be "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen" is founded
on the great fact that in all his illustrious career he scrupulously abstained from violating
the legal and constitutional rights of his fellow-citizens. When he surrendered his commission
to Congress, the President of that body spoke his highest praise in saying that he had "always
regarded the rights of the civil authorities through all dangers and disasters." Whenever power
above the law courted his acceptance, he calmly put the temptation aside. By such magnanimous
acts of forbearance he won the universal admiration of mankind and left a name which has no
rival in the history of the world.

I am far from saying that General Hancock is the only officer of the American Army who is influenced
by the example of Washington. Doubtless thousands of them are faithfully devoted to the principles
for which the men of the Revolution laid down their lives. But the distinguished honor belongs
to him of being the first officer in high command south of the Potomac, since the close of
the civil war, who has given utterance to these noble sentiments in the form of a military order.

I respectfully suggest to Congress that some public recognition of General Hancock's patriotic
conduct is due, if not to him, to the friends of law and justice throughout the country. Of
such an act as his at such a time it is but fit that the dignity should be vindicated and the
virtue proclaimed, so that its value as an example may not be lost to the nation.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, December 19, 1867.

To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit to the Senate, in answer to a resolution of that body of the 16th instant, a report[33]

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 7, 1868.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

A Spanish steamer named Nuestra Señora being in the harbor of Port Royal, S.C., on the 1st
of December, 1861, Brigadier General T.W. Sherman, who was in command of the United States
forces there, received information which he supposed justified him in seizing her, as she was
on her way from Charleston to Havana with insurgent correspondence on board. The seizure was
made accordingly, and during the ensuing spring the vessel was sent to New York, in order that
the legality of the seizure might be tried.

By a decree of June 20, 1863, Judge Betts ordered the vessel to be restored, and by a subsequent
decree, of October 15, 1863, he referred the adjustment of damages to amicable negotiations
between the two Governments.

While the proceeding in admiralty was pending, the vessel was appraised and taken by the Navy
Department at the valuation of $28,000, which sum that Department paid into the Treasury.

As the amount of this valuation can not legally be drawn from the Treasury without authority
from Congress, I recommend an appropriation for that purpose.

It is proposed to appoint a commissioner on the part of this Government to adjust, informally
in this case, with a similar commissioner on the part of Spain, the question of damages, the
commissioners to name an arbiter for points upon which they may disagree. When the amount of
the damages shall thus have been ascertained, application will be made to Congress for a further
appropriation toward paying them.

WASHINGTON CITY, January 14, 1868.

WASHINGTON, D.C., January 23, 1868.

To the Senate of the United States:

In compliance with the request of the Senate of yesterday, I return herewith their resolution
of the 21st instant, calling for information in reference to James A. Seddon, late Secretary
of War of the so-called Confederate States.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 23, 1868.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have received the following preamble and resolution, adopted by the Senate on the 8th instant:

  Whereas Senate bill No. 141, and entitled "An act for the further
  security of equal rights in the District of Columbia," having at this
  present session passed both Houses of Congress, was afterwards, on the
  11th day of December, 1867, duly presented to the President of the
  United States for his approval and signature; and

  Whereas more than ten days, exclusive of Sundays, have since elapsed in
  this session without said bill having been returned, either approved or
  disapproved: Therefore,

  Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested to
  inform the Senate whether said bill has been delivered to and received
  by the Secretary of State, as provided by the second section of the act
  of the 27th day of July, 1789.

As the act which the resolution mentions has no relevancy to the subject under inquiry, it
is presumed that it was the intention of the Senate to refer to the law of the 15th September,
1789, the second section of which prescribes--

  That whenever a bill, order, resolution, or vote of the Senate and
  House of Representatives, having been approved and signed by the
  President of the United States, or not having been returned by him with
  his objections, shall become a law or take effect, it shall forthwith
  thereafter be received by the said Secretary from the President; and
  whenever a bill, order, resolution, or vote shall be returned by the
  President with his objections, and shall, on being reconsidered, be
  agreed to be passed, and be approved by two-thirds of both Houses of
  Congress, and thereby become a law or take effect, it shall in such
  case be received by the said Secretary from the President of the Senate
  or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, in whichsoever House it
  shall last have been so approved.

Inasmuch as the bill "for the further security of equal rights in the District of Columbia"
has not become a law in either of the modes designated in the section above quoted, it has
not been delivered to the Secretary of State for record and promulgation. The Constitution
expressly declares that--

  If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days
  (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the
  same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless
  the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case
  it shall not be a law.

As stated in the preamble to the resolution, the bill to which it refers was presented for
my approval on the 11th day of December, 1867. On the 20th of same month, and before the expiration
of the ten days after the presentation of the bill to the President, the two Houses, in accordance
with a concurrent resolution adopted on the 3d [13th] of December, adjourned until the 6th
of January, 1868. Congress by their adjournment thus prevented the return of the bill within
the time prescribed by the Constitution, and it was therefore left in the precise condition
in which that instrument positively declares a bill "shall not be a law."

If the adjournment in December did not cause the failure of this bill, because not such an
adjournment as is contemplated by the Constitution in the clause which I have cited, it must
follow that such was the nature of the adjournments during the past year, on the 30th day of
March until the first Wednesday of July and from the 20th of July until the 21st of November.
Other bills will therefore be affected by the decision which may be rendered in this case,
among them one having the same title as that named in the resolution, and containing similar
provisions, which, passed by both Houses in the month of July last, failed to become a law
by reason of the adjournment of Congress before ten days for its consideration had been allowed
the Executive.

instant, together with a copy of the accompanying papers.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, February 10, 1868.

General U.S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States, Washington, D.C.

GENERAL: The extraordinary character of your letter of the 3d instant[35] would seem to preclude
any reply on my part; but the manner in which publicity has been given to the correspondence
of which that letter forms a part and the grave questions which are involved induce me to take
this mode of giving, as a proper sequel to the communications which have passed between us,
the statements of the five members of the Cabinet who were present on the occasion of our conversation
on the 14th ultimo. Copies of the letters which they have addressed to me upon the subject
are accordingly herewith inclosed.

You speak of my letter of the 31st ultimo[36] as a reiteration of the "many and gross misrepresentations"
contained in certain newspaper articles, and reassert the correctness of the statements contained
in your communication of the 28th ultimo,[37] adding--and here I give your own words--"anything
in yours in reply to it to the contrary notwithstanding."

When a controversy upon matters of fact reaches the point to which this has been brought, further
assertion or denial between the immediate parties should cease, especially where upon either
side it loses the character of the respectful discussion which is required by the relations
in which the parties stand to each other and degenerates in tone and temper. In such a case,
if there is nothing to rely upon but the opposing statements, conclusions must be drawn from
those statements alone and from whatever intrinsic probabilities they afford in favor of or
against either of the parties. I should not shrink from this test in this controversy; but,
fortunately, it is not left to this test alone. There were five Cabinet officers present at
the conversation the detail of which in my letter of the 28th [31st[37]] ultimo you allow yourself
to say contains "many and gross misrepresentations." These gentlemen heard that conversation
and have read my statement. They speak for themselves, and I leave the proof without a word
of comment.

I deem it proper before concluding this communication to notice some of the statements contained
in your letter.

You say that a performance of the promises alleged to have been made by you to the President
"would have involved a resistance to law and an inconsistency with the whole history of my
connection with the suspension of Mr. Stanton." You then state that you had fears the President
would, on the removal of Mr. Stanton, appoint someone in his place who would embarrass the
Army in carrying out the reconstruction acts, and add:

"It was to prevent such an appointment that I accepted the office of Secretary of War ad interim,
and not for the purpose of enabling you to get rid of Mr. Stanton by withholding it from him
in opposition to law, or, not doing so myself, surrendering it to one who would, as the statements
and assumptions in your communication plainly indicate was sought."

First of all, you here admit that from the very beginning of what you term "the whole history"
of your connection with Mr. Stanton's suspension you intended to circumvent the President.
It was to carry out that intent that you accepted the appointment. This was in your mind at
the time of your acceptance. It was not, then, in obedience to the order of your superior,
as has heretofore been supposed, that you assumed the duties of the office. You knew it was
the President's purpose to prevent Mr. Stanton from resuming the office of Secretary of War,
and you intended to defeat that purpose. You accepted the office, not in the interest of the
President but of Mr. Stanton. If this purpose, so entertained by you, had been confined to
yourself; if when accepting the office you had done so with a mental reservation to frustrate
the President, it would have been a tacit deception. In the ethics of some persons such a course
is allowable. But you can not stand even upon that questionable ground. The "history" of your
connection with this transaction, as written by yourself, places you in a different predicament,
and shows that you not only concealed your design from the President, but induced him to suppose
that you would carry out his purpose to keep Mr. Stanton out of office by retaining it yourself
after an attempted restoration by the Senate, so as to require Mr. Stanton to establish his
right by judicial decision.

I now give that part of this "history" as written by yourself in your letter of the 28th ultimo:[38]

"Some time after I assumed the duties of Secretary of War ad interim the President asked me
my views as to the course Mr. Stanton would have to pursue, in case the Senate should not concur
in his suspension, to obtain possession of his office. My reply was, in substance, that Mr.
Stanton would have to appeal to the courts to reinstate him, illustrating my position by citing
the ground I had taken in the case of the Baltimore police commissioners."

Now, at that time, as you admit in your letter of the 3d instant,[39] you held the office for
the very object of defeating an appeal to the courts. In that letter you say that in accepting
the office one motive was to prevent the President from appointing some other person who would
retain possession, and thus make judicial proceedings necessary. You knew the President was
unwilling to trust the office with anyone who would not by holding it compel Mr. Stanton to
resort to the courts. You perfectly understood that in this interview, "some time" after you
accepted the office, the President, not content with your silence, desired an expression of
your views, and you answered him that Mr. Stanton "would have to appeal to the courts." If
the President reposed confidence before he knew your views, and that confidence had been violated,
it might have been said he made a mistake; but a violation of confidence reposed after that
conversation was no mistake of his nor of yours. It is the fact only that needs be stated,
that at the date of this conversation you did not intend to hold the office with the purpose
of forcing Mr. Stanton into court, but did hold it then and had accepted it to prevent that
course from being carried out. In other words, you said to the President, "That is the proper
course," and you said to yourself, "I have accepted this office, and now hold it to defeat
that course." The excuse you make in a subsequent paragraph of that letter of the 28th ultimo,[38]
that afterwards you changed your views as to what would be a proper course, has nothing to
do with the point now under consideration. The point is that before you changed your views
you had secretly determined to do the very thing which at last you did--surrender the office
to Mr. Stanton. You may have changed your views as to the law, but you certainly did not change
your views as to the course you had marked out for yourself from the beginning.

I will only notice one more statement in your letter of the 3d instant[39]--that the performance
of the promises which it is alleged were made by you would have involved you in the resistance
of law. I know of no statute that would have been violated had you, carrying out your promises
in good faith, tendered your resignation when you concluded not to be made a party in any legal
proceedings. You add:

"I am in a measure confirmed in this conclusion by your recent orders directing me to disobey
orders from the Secretary of War, my superior and your subordinate, without having countermanded
his authority to issue the orders I am to disobey."

On the 24th[39] ultimo you addressed a note to the President requesting in writing an order
given to you verbally five days before to disregard orders from Mr. Stanton as Secretary of
War until you "knew from the President himself that they were his orders."

On the 29th,[40] in compliance with your request, I did give you instructions in writing "not
to obey any order from the War Department assumed to be issued by the direction of the President
unless such order is known by the General Commanding the armies of the United States to have
been authorized by the Executive."

There are some orders which a Secretary of War may issue without the authority of the President;
there are others which he issues simply as the agent of the President, and which purport to
be "by direction" of the President. For such orders the President is responsible, and he should
therefore know and understand what they are before giving such "direction." Mr. Stanton states
in his letter of the 4th instant,[41] which accompanies the published correspondence, that
he "has had no correspondence with the President since the 12th of August last;" and he further
says that since he resumed the duties of the office he has continued to discharge them "without
any personal or written communication with the President;" and he adds, "No orders have been
issued from this Department in the name of the President with my knowledge, and I have received
no orders from him."

It thus seems that Mr. Stanton now discharges the duties of the War Department without any
reference to the President and without using his name.

My order to you had only reference to orders "assumed to be issued by the direction of the
President." It would appear from Mr. Stanton's letter that you have received no such orders
from him. However, in your note to the President of the 30th ultimo,[42] in which you acknowledge
the receipt of the written order of the 29th,[43] you say that you have been informed by Mr.
Stanton that he has not received any order limiting his authority to issue orders to the Army,
according to the practice of the Department, and state that "while this authority to the War
Department is not countermanded it will be satisfactory evidence to me that any orders issued
from the War Department by direction of the President are authorized by the Executive."

The President issues an order to you to obey no order from the War Department purporting to
be made "by the direction of the President" until you have referred it to him for his approval.
You reply that you have received the President's order and will not obey it, but will obey
an order purporting to be given by his direction if it comes from the War Department. You will
not obey the direct order of the President, but will obey his indirect order. If, as you say,
there has been a practice in the War Department to issue orders in the name of the President
without his direction, does not the precise order you have requested and have received change
the practice as to the General of the Army? Could not the President countermand any such order
issued to you from the War Department? If you should receive an order from that Department,
issued in the name of the President, to do a special act, and an order directly from the President
himself not to do the act, is there a doubt which you are to obey? You answer the question
when you say to the President, in your letter of the 3d instant,[44] the Secretary of War is
"my superior and your subordinate," and yet you refuse obedience to the superior out of a deference
to the subordinate.

Without further comment upon the insubordinate attitude which you have assumed, I am at a loss
to know how you can relieve yourself from obedience to the orders of the President, who is
made by the Constitution the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, and is therefore the
official superior as well of the General of the Army as of the Secretary of War.

Respectfully, yours,

ANDREW JOHNSON.

the President and General Grant on the 14th of January, 1868, and answers thereto.]

EXECUTIVE MANSION, Washington, D.C., February 5, 1868.

SIR: The Chronicle of this morning contains a correspondence between the President and General
Grant reported from the War Department in answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives.

I beg to call your attention to that correspondence, and especially to that part of it which
refers to the conversation between the President and General Grant at the Cabinet meeting on
Tuesday, the 14th of January, and to request you to state what was said in that conversation.

Very respectfully, yours,

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., February 5, 1868.

The PRESIDENT.

SIR: Your note of this date was handed to me this evening. My recollection of the conversation
at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 14th of January, corresponds with your statement of
it in the letter of the 31st ultimo[45] in the published correspondence.

The three points specified in that letter, giving your recollection of the conversation, are
correctly stated.

Very respectfully,

GIDEON WELLES.

[Footnote 45: See pp. 615-618.]

TREASURY DEPARTMENT, February 6, 1868.

The PRESIDENT.

SIR: I have received your note of the 5th instant, calling my attention to the correspondence
between yourself and General Grant as published in the Chronicle of yesterday, especially to
that part of it which relates to what occurred at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 14th
ultimo, and requesting me to state what was said in the conversation referred to.

I can not undertake to state the precise language used, but I have no hesitation in saying
that your account of that conversation as given in your letter to General Grant under date
of the 31st ultimo[45] substantially and in all important particulars accords with my recollection
of it.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

HUGH McCULLOCH.

[Footnote 45: See pp. 615-618.]

POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT,

Washington, February 6, 1868.

The PRESIDENT.

SIR: I am in receipt of your letter of the 5th of February, calling my attention to the correspondence
published in the Chronicle between the President and General Grant, and especially to that
part of it which refers to the conversation between the President and General Grant at the
Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 14th of January, with a request that I state what was said
in that conversation.

In reply I have the honor to state that I have read carefully the correspondence in question,
and particularly the letter of the President to General Grant dated January 31, 1868.[45] The
following extract from your letter of the 31st January to General Grant is, according to my
recollection, a correct statement of the conversation that took place between the President
and General Grant at the Cabinet meeting on the 14th of January last. In the presence of the
Cabinet the President asked General Grant whether, "in conversation which took place after
his appointment as Secretary of War ad interim, he did not agree either to remain at the head
of the War Department and abide any judicial proceedings that might follow the nonconcurrence
by the Senate in Mr. Stanton's suspension, or, should he wish not to become involved in such
a controversy, to put the President in the same position with respect to the office as he occupied
previous to General Grant's appointment, by returning it to the President in time to anticipate
such action by the Senate." This General Grant admitted.

The President then asked General Grant if at the conference on the preceding Saturday he had
not, to avoid misunderstanding, requested General Grant to state what he intended to do, and,
further, if in reply to that inquiry he (General Grant) had not referred to their former conversations,
saying that from them the President understood his position, and that his (General Grant's)
action would be consistent with the understanding which had been reached.

To these questions General Grant replied in the affirmative.

The President asked General Grant if at the conclusion of their interview on Saturday it was
not understood that they were to have another conference on Monday before final action by the
Senate in the case of Mr. Stanton.

General Grant replied that such was the understanding, but that he did not suppose the Senate
would act so soon; that on Monday he had been engaged in a conference with General Sherman,
and was occupied with "many little matters," and asked if General Sherman had not called on
that day.

I take this mode of complying with the request contained in the President's letter to me, because
my attention had been called to the subject before, when the conversation between the President
and General Grant was under consideration.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALEX W. RANDALL,

Postmaster-General.

[Footnote 45: See pp. 615-618.]

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,

Washington, D.C., February 6, 1868.

The PRESIDENT.

SIR: I am in receipt of yours of yesterday, calling my attention to a correspondance between
yourself and General Grant published in the Chronicle newspaper, and especially to that part
of said correspondence "which refers to the conversation between the President and General
Grant at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 14th of January," and requesting me "to state
what was said in that conversation."

In reply I submit the following statement: At the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 14th of January,
1868, General Grant appeared and took his accustomed seat at the board. When he had been reached
in the order of business, the President asked him, as usual, if he had anything to present.

In reply the General, after referring to a note which he had that morning addressed to the
President, inclosing a copy of the resolution of the Senate refusing to concur in the reasons
for the suspension of Mr. Stanton, proceeded to say that he regarded his duties as Secretary
of War ad interim terminated by that resolution, and that he could not lawfully exercise such
duties for a moment after the adoption of the resolution by the Senate; that the resolution
reached him last night, and that this morning he had gone to the War Department, entered the
Secretary's room, bolted one door on the inside, locked the other on the outside, delivered
the key to the Adjutant-General, and proceeded to the Headquarters of the Army and addressed
the note above mentioned to the President, informing him that he (General Grant) was no longer
Secretary of War ad interim.

The President expressed great surprise at the course which General Grant had thought proper
to pursue, and, addressing himself to the General, proceeded to say, in substance, that he
had anticipated such action on the part of the Senate, and, being very desirous to have the
constitutionality of the tenure-of-office bill tested and his right to suspend or remove a
member of the Cabinet decided by the judicial tribunals of the country, he had some time ago,
and shortly after General Grant's appointment as Secretary of War ad interim, asked the General
what his action would be in the event that the Senate should refuse to concur in the suspension
of Mr. Stanton, and that the General had then agreed either to remain at the head of the War
Department till a decision could be obtained from the court or resign the office into the hands
of the President before the case was acted upon by the Senate, so as to place the President
in the same situation he occupied at the time of his (Grant's) appointment.

The President further said that the conversation was renewed on the preceding Saturday, at
which time he asked the General what he intended to do if the Senate should undertake to reinstate
Mr. Stanton, in reply to which the General referred to their former conversation upon the same
subject and said: "You understand my position, and my conduct will be conformable to that understanding;"
that he (the General) then expressed a repugnance to being made a party to a judicial proceeding,
saying that he would expose himself to fine and imprisonment by doing so, as his continuing
to discharge the duties of Secretary of War ad interim after the Senate should have refused
to concur in the suspension of Mr. Stanton would be a violation of the tenure-of-office bill;
that in reply to this he (the President) informed General Grant he had not suspended Mr. Stanton
under the tenure-of-office bill, but by virtue of the powers conferred on him by the Constitution;
and that, as to the fine and imprisonment, he (the President) would pay whatever fine was imposed
and submit to whatever imprisonment might be adjudged against him (the General); that they
continued the conversation for some time, discussing the law at length, and that they finally
separated without having reached a definite conclusion, and with the understanding that the
General would see the President again on Monday.

In reply General Grant admitted that the conversations had occurred, and said that at the first
conversation he had given it as his opinion to the President that in the event of nonconcurrence
by the Senate in the action of the President in respect to the Secretary of War the question
would have to be decided by the court--that Mr. Stanton would have to appeal to the court to
reinstate him in office; that the ins would remain in till they could be displaced and the
outs put in by legal proceedings; and that he then thought so, and had agreed that if he should
change his mind he would notify the President in time to enable him to make another appointment,
but that at the time of the first conversation he had not looked very closely into the law;
that it had recently been discussed by the newspapers, and that this had induced him to examine
it more carefully, and that he had come to the conclusion that if the Senate should refuse
to concur in the suspension Mr. Stanton would thereby be reinstated, and that he (Grant) could
not continue thereafter to act as Secretary of War ad interim without subjecting himself to
fine and imprisonment, and that he came over on Saturday to inform the President of this change
in his views, and did so inform him; that the President replied that he had not suspended Mr.
Stanton under the tenure-of-office bill, but under the Constitution, and had appointed him
(Grant) by virtue of the authority derived from the Constitution, etc.; that they continued
to discuss the matter some time, and finally he left, without any conclusion having been reached,
expecting to see the President again on Monday.

He then proceeded to explain why he had not called on the President on Monday, saying that
he had had a long interview with General Sherman, that various little matters had occupied
his time till it was late, and that he did not think the Senate would act so soon, and asked:
"Did not General Sherman call on you on Monday?"

I do not know what passed between the President and General Grant on Saturday, except as I
learned it from the conversation between them at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and the foregoing
is substantially what then occurred. The precise words used on the occasion are not, of course,
given exactly in the order in which they were spoken, but the ideas expressed and the facts
stated are faithfully preserved and presented.

I have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,

O.H. BROWNING.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, February 6, 1868.

The PRESIDENT.

SIR: The meeting to which you refer in your letter was a regular Cabinet meeting. While the
members were assembling, and before the President had entered the council chamber, General
Grant on coming in said to me that he was in attendance there, not as a member of the Cabinet,
but upon invitation, and I replied by the inquiry whether there was a change in the War Department.
After the President had taken his seat, business went on in the usual way of hearing matters
submitted by the several Secretaries. When the time came for the Secretary of War, General
Grant said that he was now there, not as Secretary of War, but upon the President's invitation;
that he had retired from the War Department. A slight difference then appeared about the supposed
invitation, General Grant saying that the officer who had borne his letter to the President
that morning announcing his retirement from the War Department had told him that the President
desired to see him at the Cabinet, to which the President answered that when General Grant's
communication was delivered to him the President simply replied that he supposed General Grant
would be very soon at the Cabinet meeting. I regarded the conversation thus begun as an incidental
one. It went on quite informally, and consisted of a statement on your part of your views in
regard to the understanding of the tenure upon which General Grant had assented to hold the
War Department ad interim and of his replies by way of answer and explanation. It was respectful
and courteous on both sides. Being in this conversational form, its details could only have
been preserved by verbatim report. So far as I know, no such report was made at the time. I
can give only the general effect of the conversation. Certainly you stated that, although you
had reported the reasons for Mr. Stanton's suspension to the Senate, you nevertheless held
that he would not be entitled to resume the office of Secretary of War even if the Senate should
disapprove of his suspension, and that you had proposed to have the question tested by judicial
process, to be applied to the person who should be the incumbent of the Department under your
designation of Secretary of War ad interim in the place of Mr. Stanton. You contended that
this was well understood between yourself and General Grant; that when he entered the War Department
as Secretary ad interim he expressed his concurrence in a belief that the question of Mr. Stanton's
restoration would be a question for the courts; that in a subsequent conversation with General
Grant you had adverted to the understanding thus had, and that General Grant expressed his
concurrence in it; that at some conversation which had been previously held General Grant said
he still adhered to the same construction of the law, but said if he should change his opinion
he would give you seasonable notice of it, so that you should in any case be placed in the
same position in regard to the War Department that you were while General Grant held it ad
interim. I did not understand General Grant as denying nor as explicitly admitting these statements
in the form and full extent to which you made them. His admission of them was rather indirect
and circumstantial, though I did not understand it to be an evasive one. He said that, reasoning
from what occurred in the case of the police in Maryland, which he regarded as a parallel one,
he was of opinion, and so assured you, that it would be his right and duty under your instructions
to hold the War Office after the Senate should disapprove of Mr. Stanton's suspension until
the question should be decided upon by the courts; that he remained until very recently of
that opinion, and that on the Saturday before the Cabinet meeting a conversation was held between
yourself and him in which the subject was generally discussed.

General Grant's statement was that in that conversation he had stated to you the legal difficulties
which might arise, involving fine and imprisonment, under the civil-tenure bill, and that he
did not care to subject himself to those penalties; that you replied to this remark that you
regarded the civil-tenure bill as unconstitutional and did not think its penalties were to
be feared, or that you would voluntarily assume them; and you insisted that General Grant should
either retain the office until relieved by yourself, according to what you claimed was the
original understanding between yourself and him, or, by seasonable notice of change of purpose
on his part, put you in the same situation which you would be if he adhered. You claimed that
General Grant finally said in that Saturday's conversation that you understood his views, and
his proceedings thereafter would be consistent with what had been so understood. General Grant
did not controvert, nor can I say that he admitted, this last statement. Certainly General
Grant did not at any time in the Cabinet meeting insist that he had in the Saturday's conversation,
either distinctly or finally, advised you of his determination to retire from the charge of
the War Department otherwise than under your own subsequent direction. He acquiesced in your
statement that the Saturday's conversation ended with an expectation that there would be a
subsequent conference on the subject, which he, as well as yourself, supposed could seasonably
take place on Monday. You then alluded to the fact that General Grant did not call upon you
on Monday, as you had expected from that conversation. General Grant admitted that it was his
expectation or purpose to call upon you on Monday. General Grant assigned reasons for the omission.
He said he was in conference with General Sherman; that there were many little matters to be
attended to; he had conversed upon the matter of the incumbency of the War Department with
General Sherman, and he expected that General Sherman would call upon you on Monday. My own
mind suggested a further explanation, but I do not remember whether it was mentioned or not,
namely, that it was not supposed by General Grant on Monday that the Senate would decide the
question so promptly as to anticipate further explanation between yourself and him if delayed
beyond that day. General Grant made another explanation--that he was engaged on Sunday with
General Sherman, and I think, also, on Monday, in regard to the War Department matter, with
a hope, though he did not say in an effort, to procure an amicable settlement of the affair
of Mr. Stanton, and he still hoped that it would be brought about.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

WASHINGTON, D.C., February 11, 1868.

To the House of Representatives:

The accompanying letter from General Grant, received since the transmission to the House of
Representatives of my communication of this date, is submitted to the House as a part of the
correspondence referred to in the resolution of the 10th instant.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES.

Washington, D.C., February 11, 1868.

His Excellency A. JOHNSON,

President of the United States.

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10th instant,[46]
accompanied by statements of five Cabinet ministers of their recollection of what occurred
in Cabinet meeting on the 14th of January. Without admitting anything in these statements where
they differ from anything heretofore stated by me, I propose to notice only that portion of
your communication wherein I am charged with insubordination. I think it will be plain to the
reader of my letter of the 30th of January[47] that I did not propose to disobey any legal
order of the President distinctly given, but only gave an interpretation of what would be regarded
as satisfactory evidence of the President's sanction to orders communicated by the Secretary
of War. I will say here that your letter of the 10th instant[48] contains the first intimation
I have had that you did not accept that interpretation.

Now for reasons for giving that interpretation. It was clear to me before my letter of January
30[47] was written that I, the person having more public business to transact with the Secretary
of War than any other of the President's subordinates, was the only one who had been instructed
to disregard the authority of Mr. Stanton where his authority was derived as agent of the President.

On the 27th of January I received a letter from the Secretary of War (copy herewith) directing
me to furnish escort to public treasure from the Rio Grande to New Orleans, etc., at the request
of the Secretary of the Treasury to him. I also send two other inclosures, showing recognition
of Mr. Stanton as Secretary of War by both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Postmaster-General,
in all of which cases the Secretary of War had to call upon me to make the orders requested
or give the information desired, and where his authority to do so is derived, in my view, as
agent of the President.

With an order so clearly ambiguous as that of the President here referred to, it was my duty
to inform the President of my interpretation of it and to abide by that interpretation until
I received other orders.

Disclaiming any intention, now or heretofore, of disobeying any legal order of the President
distinctly communicated,

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U.S. GRANT, General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, January 27, 1868.

General U.S. GRANT,

Commanding Army United States.

GENERAL: The Secretary of the Treasury has requested this Department to afford A.F. Randall,
special agent of the Treasury Department, such military aid as may be necessary to secure and
forward for deposit from Brownsville, Tex., to New Orleans public moneys in possession of custom-house
officers at Brownsville, and which are deemed insecure at that place.

You will please give such directions as you may deem proper to the officer commanding at Brownsville
to carry into effect the request of the Treasury Department, the instructions to be sent by
telegraph to Galveston, to the care of A.F. Randall, special agent, who is at Galveston waiting
telegraphic orders, there being no telegraphic communication with Brownsville, and the necessity
for military protection to the public moneys represented as urgent.

Please favor me with a copy of such instructions as you may give, in order that they may be
communicated to the Secretary of the Treasury.

Yours, truly,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT, CONTRACT OFFICE,

Washington, February 3, 1868.

The Honorable the SECRETARY OF WAR.

SIR: It has been represented to this Department that in October last a military commission
was appointed to settle upon some general plan of defense for the Texas frontiers, and that
the said commission has made a report recommending a line of posts from the Rio Grande to the
Red River.

An application is now pending in this Department for a change in the course of the San Antonio
and El Paso mail, so as to send it by way of Forts Mason, Griffin, and Stockton instead of
Camps Hudson and Lancaster. This application requires immediate decision, but before final
action can be had thereon it is desired to have some official information as to the report
of the commission above referred to.

Accordingly, I have the honor to request that you will cause this Department to be furnished
as early as possible with the information desired in the premises, and also with a copy of
the report, if any has been made by the commission.

Very respectfully, etc.,

GEO. W. McCLELLAN,

Second Assistant Postmaster-General.

FEBRUARY 3, 1868.

Referred to the General of the Army for report.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT, January 29, 1868.

The Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR.

SIR: It is represented to this Department that a band of robbers has obtained such a foothold
in the section of country between Humboldt and Lawrence, Kans., committing depredations upon
travelers, both by public and private conveyance, that the safety of the public money collected
by the receiver of the land office at Humboldt requires that it should be guarded during its
transit from Humboldt to Lawrence. I have therefore the honor to request that the proper commanding
officer of the district may be instructed by the War Department, if in the opinion of the honorable
Secretary of War it can be done without prejudice to the public interests, to furnish a sufficient
military guard to protect such moneys as may be in transitu from the above office for the purpose
of being deposited to the credit of the Treasurer of the United States. As far as we are now
advised, such service will not be necessary oftener than once a month. Will you please advise
me of the action taken, that I may instruct the receiver and the Commissioner of the General
Land Office in the matter?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. McCULLOCH,

Secretary of the Treasury.

Respectfully referred to the General of the Army to give the necessary orders in this case
and to furnish this Department a copy for the information of the Secretary of the Treasury.

By order of the Secretary of War:

ED. SCHRIVER,

Inspector-General.

of February 11, 1868, and their inclosures.]

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, February 4, 1868.

Hon. SCHUYLER COLFAX,

Speaker of the House of Representatives.

SIR: In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 3d instant, I transmit
herewith copies furnished me by General Grant of correspondence between him and the President
relating to the Secretary of War, and which he reports to be all the correspondence he has
had with the President on the subject.

I have had no correspondence with the President since the 12th of August last. After the action
of the Senate on his alleged reason for my suspension from the office of Secretary of War,
I resumed the duties of that office, as required by the act of Congress, and have continued
to discharge them without any personal or written communication with the President. No orders
have been issued from this Department in the name of the President with my knowledge, and I
have received no orders from him.

The correspondence sent herewith embraces all the correspondence known to me on the subject
referred to in the resolution of the House of Representatives.

I have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

General Grant to the President.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Washington, January 24, 1868.

His Excellency A. JOHNSON,

President of the United States.

SIR: I have the honor very respectfully to request to have in writing the order which the President
gave me verbally on Sunday, the 19th instant, to disregard the orders of the Hon. E.M. Stanton
as Secretary of War until I knew from the President himself that they were his orders.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U.S. GRANT, General.

General Grant to the President.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Washington, D.C., January 28, 1868.

His Excellency A. JOHNSON,

President of the United States.

SIR: On the 24th instant I requested you to give me in writing the instructions which you had
previously given me verbally not to obey any order from Hon. E.M. Stanton, Secretary of War,
unless I knew that it came from yourself. To this written request I received a message that
has left doubt in my mind of your intentions. To prevent any possible misunderstanding, therefore,
I renew the request that you will give me written instructions, and till they are received
will suspend action on your verbal ones.

I am compelled to ask these instructions in writing in consequence of the many and gross misrepresentations
affecting my personal honor circulated through the press for the last fortnight, purporting
to come from the President, of conversations which occurred either with the President privately
in his office or in Cabinet meeting. What is written admits of no misunderstanding.

In view of the misrepresentations referred to, it will be well to state the facts in the case.

Some time after I assumed the duties of Secretary of War ad interim the President asked me
my views as to the course Mr. Stanton would have to pursue, in case the Senate should not concur
in his suspension, to obtain possession of his office. My reply was, in substance, that Mr.
Stanton would have to appeal to the courts to reinstate him, illustrating my position by citing
the ground I had taken in the case of the Baltimore police commissioners.

In that case I did not doubt the technical right of Governor Swann to remove the old commissioners
and to appoint their successors. As the old commissioners refused to give up, however, I contended
that no resource was left but to appeal to the courts.

Finding that the President was desirous of keeping Mr. Stanton out of office, whether sustained
in the suspension or not, I stated that I had not looked particularly into the tenure-of-office
bill, but that what I had stated was a general principle, and if I should change my mind in
this particular case I would inform him of the fact.

Subsequently, on reading the tenure-of-office bill closely, I found that I could not, without
violation of the law, refuse to vacate the office of Secretary of War the moment Mr. Stanton
was reinstated by the Senate, even though the President should order me to retain it, which
he never did.

Taking this view of the subject, and learning on Saturday, the 11th instant, that the Senate
had taken up the subject of Mr. Stanton's suspension, after some conversation with Lieutenant
General Sherman and some members of my staff, in which I stated that the law left me no discretion
as to my action should Mr. Stanton be reinstated, and that I intended to inform the President,
I went to the President for the sole purpose of making this decision known, and did so make
it known.

In doing this I fulfilled the promise made in our last preceding conversation on the subject.

The President, however, instead of accepting my view of the requirements of the tenure-of-office
bill, contended that he had suspended Mr. Stanton under the authority given by the Constitution,
and that the same authority did not preclude him from reporting, as an act of courtesy, his
reasons for the suspension to the Senate; that, having appointed me under the authority given
by the Constitution, and not under any act of Congress, I could not be governed by the act.
I stated that the law was binding on me, constitutional or not, until set aside by the proper
tribunal. An hour or more was consumed, each reiterating his views on this subject, until,
getting late, the President said he would see me again.

I did not agree to call again on Monday, nor at any other definite time, nor was I sent for
by the President until the following Tuesday.

From the 11th to the Cabinet meeting on the 14th instant a doubt never entered my mind about
the President's fully understanding my position, namely, that if the Senate refused to concur
in the suspension of Mr. Stanton my powers as Secretary of War ad interim would cease and Mr.
Stanton's right to resume at once the functions of his office would under the law be indisputable,
and I acted accordingly. With Mr. Stanton I had no communication, direct nor indirect, on the
subject of his reinstatement during his suspension.

I knew it had been recommended to the President to send in the name of Governor Cox, of Ohio,
for Secretary of War, and thus save all embarrassment--a proposition that I sincerely hoped
he would entertain favorably; General Sherman seeing the President at my particular request
to urge this on the 13th instant.

On Tuesday (the day Mr. Stanton reentered the office of the Secretary of War) General Comstock,
who had carried my official letter announcing that with Mr. Stanton's reinstatement by the
Senate I had ceased to be Secretary of War ad interim, and who saw the President open and read
the communication, brought back to me from the President a message that he wanted to see me
that day at the Cabinet meeting, after I had made known the fact that I was no longer Secretary
of War ad interim.

At this meeting, after opening it as though I were a member of the Cabinet, when reminded of
the notification already given him that I was no longer Secretary of War ad interim, the President
gave a version of the conversations alluded to already. In this statement it was asserted that
in both conversations I had agreed to hold on to the office of Secretary of War until displaced
by the courts, or resign, so as to place the President where he would have been had I never
accepted the office. After hearing the President through, I stated our conversations substantially
as given in this letter. I will add that my conversation before the Cabinet embraced other
matter not pertinent here, and is therefore left out.

I in no wise admitted the correctness of the President's statement of our conversations, though,
to soften the evident contradiction my statement gave, I said (alluding to our first conversation
on the subject) the President might have understood me the way he said, namely, that I had
promised to resign if I did not resist the reinstatement. I made no such promise.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U.S. GRANT, General.

His Excellency A. JOHNSON,

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the return of my note of the 24th instant,[49] with your
indorsement thereon, that I am not to obey any order from the War Department assumed to be
issued by the direction of the President unless such order is known by me to have been authorized
by the Executive, and in reply thereto to say that I am informed by the Secretary of War that
he has not received from the Executive any order or instructions limiting or impairing his
authority to issue orders to the Army, as has heretofore been his practice under the law and
the customs of the Department. While this authority to the War Department is not countermanded
it will be satisfactory evidence to me that any orders issued from the War Department by direction
of the President are authorized by the Executive.

The President to General Grant.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, January 31, 1868.

General U.S. GRANT,

Commanding United States Armies.

GENERAL: I have received your communication of the 28th instant,[50] renewing your request
of the 24th,[49] that I should repeat in a written form my verbal instructions of the 19th
instant, viz, that you obey no order from the Hon. Edwin M. Stanton as Secretary of War unless
you have information that it was issued by the President's directions.

In submitting this request (with which I complied on the 29th instant[51]) you take occasion
to allude to recent publications in reference to the circumstances connected with the vacation
by yourself of the office of Secretary of War ad interim, and with the view of correcting statements
which you term "gross misrepresentations" give at length your own recollection of the facts
under which, without the sanction of the President, from whom you had received and accepted
the appointment, you yielded the Department of War to the present incumbent.

As stated in your communication, some time after you had assumed the duties of Secretary of
War ad interim we interchanged views respecting the course that should be pursued in the event
of nonconcurrence by the Senate in the suspension from office of Mr. Stanton. I sought that
interview, calling myself at the War Department. My sole object in then bringing the subject
to your attention was to ascertain definitely what would be your own action should such an
attempt be made for his restoration to the War Department. That object was accomplished, for
the interview terminated with the distinct understanding that if upon reflection you should
prefer not to become a party to the controversy or should conclude that it would be your duty
to surrender the Department to Mr. Stanton upon action in his favor by the Senate you were
to return the office to me prior to a decision by the Senate, in order that if I desired to
do so I might designate someone to succeed you. It must have been apparent to you that had
not this understanding been reached it was my purpose to relieve you from the further discharge
of the duties of Secretary of War ad interim and to appoint some other person in that capacity.

Other conversations upon this subject ensued, all of them having on my part the same object
and leading to the same conclusion as the first. It is not necessary, however, to refer to
any of them excepting that of Saturday, the 11th instant, mentioned in your communication.
As it was then known that the Senate had proceeded to consider the case of Mr. Stanton, I was
anxious to learn your determination. After a protracted interview, during which the provisions
of the tenure-of-office bill were freely discussed, you said that, as had been agreed upon
in our first conference, you would either return the office to my possession in time to enable
me to appoint a successor before final action by the Senate upon Mr. Stanton's suspension,
or would remain as its head, awaiting a decision of the question by judicial proceedings. It
was then understood that there would be a further conference on Monday, by which time I supposed
you would be prepared to inform me of your final decision. You failed, however, to fulfill
the engagement, and on Tuesday notified me in writing of the receipt by you of official notification
of the action of the Senate in the case of Mr. Stanton, and at the same time informed me that
according to the act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices your functions as Secretary
of War ad interim ceased from the moment of the receipt of the notice. You thus, in disregard
of the understanding between us, vacated the office without having given me notice of your
intention to do so. It is but just, however, to say that in your communication you claim that
you did inform me of your purpose, and thus "fulfilled the promise made in our last preceding
conversation on this subject." The fact that such a promise existed is evidence of an arrangement
of the kind I have mentioned. You had found in our first conference "that the President was
desirous of keeping Mr. Stanton out of office whether sustained in the suspension or not."
You knew what reasons had induced the President to ask from you a promise; you also knew that
in case your views of duty did not accord with his own convictions it was his purpose to fill
your place by another appointment. Even ignoring the existence of a positive understanding
between us, these conclusions were plainly deducible from our various conversations. It is
certain, however, that even under these circumstances you did not offer to return the place
to my possession, but, according to your own statement, placed yourself in a position where,
could I have anticipated your action, I would have been compelled to ask of you, as I was compelled
to ask of your predecessor in the War Department, a letter of resignation, or else to resort
to the more disagreeable expedient of suspending you by a successor.

As stated in your letter, the nomination of Governor Cox, of Ohio, for the office of Secretary
of War was suggested to me. His appointment as Mr. Stanton's successor was urged in your name,
and it was said that his selection would save further embarrassment. I did not think that in
the selection of a Cabinet officer I should be trammeled by such considerations. I was prepared
to take the responsibility of deciding the question in accordance with my ideas of constitutional
duty, and, having determined upon a course which I deemed right and proper, was anxious to
learn the steps you would take should the possession of the War Department be demanded by Mr.
Stanton. Had your action been in conformity to the understanding between us, I do not believe
that the embarrassment would have attained its present proportions or that the probability
of its repetition would have been so great.

I know that, with a view to an early termination of a state of affairs so detrimental to the
public interests, you voluntarily offered, both on Wednesday, the 15th instant, and on the
succeeding Sunday, to call upon Mr. Stanton and urge upon him that the good of the service
required his resignation. I confess that I considered your proposal as a sort of reparation
for the failure on your part to act in accordance with an understanding more than once repeated,
which I thought had received your full assent, and under which you could have returned to me
the office which I had conferred upon you, thus saving yourself from embarrassment and leaving
the responsibility where it properly belonged--with the President, who is accountable for the
faithful execution of the laws.

I have not yet been informed by you whether, as twice proposed by yourself, you have called
upon Mr. Stanton and made an effort to induce him voluntarily to retire from the War Department.

You conclude your communication with a reference to our conversation at the meeting of the
Cabinet held on Tuesday, the 14th instant. In your account of what then occurred you say that
after the President had given his version of our previous conversations you stated them substantially
as given in your letter; that you in no wise admitted the correctness of his statement of them,
"though, to soften the evident contradiction my statement gave, I said (alluding to our first
conversation on the subject) the President might have understood me the way he said, namely,
that I had promised to resign if I did not resist the reinstatement. I made no such promise."

My recollection of what then transpired is diametrically the reverse of your narration. In
the presence of the Cabinet I asked you--

First. If, in a conversation which took place shortly after your appointment as Secretary of
War ad interim, you did not agree either to remain at the head of the War Department and abide
any judicial proceedings that might follow nonconcurrence by the Senate in Mr. Stanton's suspension,
or, should you wish not to become involved in such a controversy, to put me in the same position
with respect to the office as I occupied previous to your appointment, by returning it to me
in time to anticipate such action by the Senate. This you admitted.

Second. I then asked you if, at our conference on the preceding Saturday, I had not, to avoid
misunderstanding, requested you to state what you intended to do, and, further, if in reply
to that inquiry you had not referred to our former conversations, saying that from them I understood
your position, and that your action would be consistent with the understanding which had been
reached. To these questions you also replied in the affirmative.

Third. I next asked if at the conclusion of our interview on Saturday it was not understood
that we were to have another conference on Monday before final action by the Senate in the
case of Mr. Stanton. You replied that such was the understanding, but that you did not suppose
the Senate would act so soon; that on Monday you had been engaged in a conference with General
Sherman and were occupied with "many little matters," and asked if General Sherman had not
called on that day. What relevancy General Sherman's visit to me on Monday had with the purpose
for which you were then to have called I am at a loss to perceive, as he certainly did not
inform me whether you had determined to retain possession of the office or to afford me an
opportunity to appoint a successor in advance of any attempted reinstatement of Mr. Stanton.

This account of what passed between us at the Cabinet meeting on the 14th instant widely differs
from that contained in your communication, for it shows that instead of having "stated our
conversations as given in the letter" which has made this reply necessary you admitted that
my recital of them was entirely accurate. Sincerely anxious, however, to be correct in my statements,
I have to-day read this narration of what occurred on the 14th instant to the members of the
Cabinet who were then present. They, without exception, agree in its accuracy.

It is only necessary to add that on Wednesday morning, the 15th instant, you called on me,
in company with Lieutenant-General Sherman. After some preliminary conversation, you remarked
that an article in the National Intelligencer of that date did you much injustice. I replied
that I had not read the Intelligencer of that morning. You then first told me that it was your
intention to urge Mr. Stanton to resign his office.

After you had withdrawn I carefully read the article of which you had spoken, and found that
its statements of the understanding between us were substantially correct. On the 17th I caused
it to be read to four of the five members of the Cabinet who were present at our conference
on the 14th, and they concurred in the general accuracy of its statements respecting our conversation
upon that occasion.

In reply to your communication, I have deemed it proper, in order to prevent further misunderstanding,
to make this simple recital of facts.

Very respectfully, yours,

ANDREW JOHNSON.

General Grant to the President.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Washington, D.C., February 3, 1868.

His Excellency A. JOHNSON,

President of the United States.

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 31st ultimo,[52]
in answer to mine of the 28th ultimo[53]. After a careful reading and comparison of it with
the article in the National Intelligencer of the 15th ultimo and the article over the initials
J.B.S. in the New York World of the 27th ultimo, purporting to be based upon your statement
and that of the members of your Cabinet therein named, I find it to be but a reiteration, only
somewhat more in detail, of the "many and gross misrepresentations" contained in these articles,
and which my statement of the facts set forth in my letter of the 28th ultimo[53] was intended
to correct; and I here reassert the correctness of my statements in that letter, anything in
yours in reply to it to the contrary notwithstanding.

I confess my surprise that the Cabinet officers referred to should so greatly misapprehend
the facts in the matter of admissions alleged to have been made by me at the Cabinet meeting
of the 14th ultimo as to suffer their names to be made the basis of the charges in the newspaper
article referred to, or agree in the accuracy, as you affirm they do, of your account of what
occurred at that meeting.

You know that we parted on Saturday, the 11th ultimo, without any promise on my part, either
express or implied, to the effect that I would hold on to the office of Secretary of War ad
interim against the action of the Senate, or, declining to do so myself, would surrender it
to you before such action was had, or that I would see you again at any fixed time on the subject.

The performance of the promises alleged by you to have been made by me would have involved
a resistance to law and an inconsistency with the whole history of my connection with the suspension
of Mr. Stanton.

From our conversations and my written protest of August 1, 1867, against the removal of Mr.
Stanton, you must have known that my greatest objection to his removal or suspension was the
fear that someone would be appointed in his stead who would, by opposition to the laws relating
to the restoration of the Southern States to their proper relations to the Government, embarrass
the Army in the performance of duties especially imposed upon it by these laws; and it was
to prevent such an appointment that I accepted the office of Secretary of War ad interim, and
not for the purpose of enabling you to get rid of Mr. Stanton by my withholding it from him
in opposition to law, or, not doing so myself, surrendering it to one who would, as the statement
and assumptions in your communication plainly indicate was sought. And it was to avoid this
same danger, as well as to relieve you from the personal embarrassment in which Mr. Stanton's
reinstatement would place you, that I urged the appointment of Governor Cox, believing that
it would be agreeable to you and also to Mr. Stanton, satisfied as I was that it was the good
of the country, and not the office, the latter desired.

On the 15th ultimo, in presence of General Sherman, I stated to you that I thought Mr. Stanton
would resign, but did not say that I would advise him to do so. On the 18th I did agree with
General Sherman to go and advise him to that course, and on the 19th I had an interview alone
with Mr. Stanton, which led me to the conclusion that any advice to him of the kind would be
useless, and I so informed General Sherman.

Before I consented to advise Mr. Stanton to resign, I understood from him, in a conversation
on the subject immediately after his reinstatement, that it was his opinion that the act of
Congress entitled "An act temporarily to supply vacancies in the Executive Departments in certain
cases," approved February 20, 1863, was repealed by subsequent legislation, which materially
influenced my action. Previous to this time I had had no doubt that the law of 1863 was still
in force, and, notwithstanding my action, a fuller examination of the law leaves a question
in my mind whether it is or is not repealed. This being the case, I could not now advise his
resignation, lest the same danger I apprehended on his first removal might follow.

The course you would have it understood I agreed to pursue was in violation of law and without
orders from you, while the course I did pursue, and which I never doubted you fully understood,
was in accordance with law and not in disobedience of any orders of my superior.

And now, Mr. President, when my honor as a soldier and integrity as a man have been so violently
assailed, pardon me for saying that I can but regard this whole matter, from the beginning
to the end, as an attempt to involve me in the resistance of law, for which you hesitated to
assume the responsibility in orders, and thus to destroy my character before the country. I
am in a measure confirmed in this conclusion by your recent orders directing me to disobey
orders from the Secretary of War, my superior and your subordinate, without having countermanded
his authority to issue the orders I am to disobey.

With the assurance, Mr. President, that nothing less than a vindication of my personal honor
and character could have induced this correspondence on my part,

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U.S. GRANT, General.

Respectfully forwarded to the Secretary of War for his information, and to be made a part of
correspondence previously furnished on same subject.

U.S. GRANT, General.

Copies of the communications upon this subject addressed to Mr. Stanton and the Adjutant-General
are herewith transmitted for the information of the Senate.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., February 22, 1868.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have received a copy of the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 21st instant, as follows:

  Whereas the Senate have received and considered the communication of
  the President stating that he had removed Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary
  of War, and had designated the Adjutant-General of the Army to act as
  Secretary of War ad interim: Therefore,

  Resolved by the Senate of the United States, That under the
  Constitution and laws of the United States the President has no power
  to remove the Secretary of War and designate any other officer to
  perform the duties of that office ad interim.

This resolution is confined to the power of the President to remove the Secretary of War and
to designate another officer to perform the duties of the office ad interim, and by its preamble
is made expressly applicable to the removal of Mr. Stanton and the designation to act ad interim
of the Adjutant-General of the Army. Without, therefore, attempting to discuss the general
power of removal as to all officers, upon which subject no expression of opinion is contained
in the resolution, I shall confine myself to the question as thus limited--the power to remove
the Secretary of War.

It is declared in the resolution--

  That under the Constitution and laws of the United States the President
  has no power to remove the Secretary of War and designate any other
  officer to perform the duties of that office ad interim.

As to the question of power under the Constitution, I do not propose at present to enter upon
its discussion.

The uniform practice from the beginning of the Government, as established by every President
who has exercised the office, and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have
settled the question in favor of the power of the President to remove all officers excepting
a class holding appointments of a judicial character. No practice nor any decision has ever
excepted a Secretary of War from this general power of the President to make removals from office.

It is only necessary, then, that I should refer to the power of the Executive, under the laws
of the United States, to remove from office a Secretary of War. The resolution denies that
under these laws this power has any existence. In other words, it affirms that no such authority
is recognized or given by the statutes of the country.

What, then, are the laws of the United States which deny the President the power to remove
that officer? I know but two laws which bear upon this question. The first in order of time
is the act of August 7, 1789, creating the Department of War, which, after providing for a
Secretary as its principal officer, proceeds as follows:

  SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That there shall be in the said
  Department an inferior officer, to be appointed by the said principal
  officer, to be employed therein as he shall deem proper, and to be
  called the chief clerk in the Department of War, and who, whenever the
  said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of
  the United States, or in any other case of vacancy, shall during such
  vacancy have the charge and custody of all records, books, and papers
  appertaining to the said Department.

It is clear that this act, passed by a Congress many of whose members participated in the formation
of the Constitution, so far from denying the power of the President to remove the Secretary
of War, recognizes it as existing in the Executive alone, without the concurrence of the Senate
or of any other department of the Government. Furthermore, this act does not purport to confer
the power by legislative authority, nor in fact was there any other existing legislation through
which it was bestowed upon the Executive. The recognition of the power by this act is therefore
complete as a recognition under the Constitution itself, for there was no other source or authority
from which it could be derived.

The other act which refers to this question is that regulating the tenure of certain civil
offices, passed by Congress on the 2d day of March, 1867. The first section of that act is
in the following words:

  That every person holding any civil office to which he has been
  appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every
  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office, and shall
  become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled to hold
  such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed
  and duly qualified, except as herein otherwise provided: Provided,
  That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, of the Navy,
  and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the Attorney-General
  shall hold their offices, respectively, for and during the term of
  the President by whom they may have been appointed and for one month
  thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of
  the Senate.

The fourth section of the same act restricts the term of offices to the limit prescribed by
the law creating them.

That part of the first section which precedes the proviso declares that every person holding
a civil office to which he has been or may be appointed by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate shall hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed.
It purports to take from the Executive, during the fixed time established for the tenure of
the office, the independent power of removal, and to require for such removal the concurrent
action of the President and the Senate.

The proviso that follows proceeds to fix the term of office of the seven heads of Departments,
whose tenure never had been defined before, by prescribing that they "shall hold their offices,
respectively, for and during the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed
and for one month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."

Thus, as to these enumerated officers, the proviso takes from the President the power of removal
except with the advice and consent of the Senate. By its terms, however, before he can be deprived
of the power to displace them it must appear that he himself has appointed them. It is only
in that case that they have any tenure of office or any independent right to hold during the
term of the President and for one month after the cessation of his official functions. The
proviso, therefore, gives no tenure of office to any one of these officers who has been appointed
by a former President beyond one month after the accession of his successor.

In the case of Mr. Stanton, the only appointment under which he held the office of Secretary
of War was that conferred upon him by my immediate predecessor, with the advice and consent
of the Senate. He has never held from me any appointment as the head of the War Department.
Whatever right he had to hold the office was derived from that original appointment and my
own sufferance. The law was not intended to protect such an incumbent of the War Department
by taking from the President the power to remove him. This, in my judgment, is perfectly clear,
and the law itself admits of no other just construction. We find in all that portion of the
first section which precedes the proviso that as to civil officers generally the President
is deprived of the power of removal, and it is plain that if there had been no proviso that
power would just as clearly have been taken from him so far as it applies to the seven heads
of Departments. But for reasons which were no doubt satisfactory to Congress these principal
officers were specially provided for, and as to them the express and only requirement is that
the President who has appointed them shall not without the advice and consent of the Senate
remove them from office. The consequence is that as to my Cabinet, embracing the seven officers
designated in the first section, the act takes from me the power, without the concurrence of
the Senate, to remove any one of them that I have appointed, but it does not protect such of
them as I did not appoint, nor give to them any tenure of office beyond my pleasure.

An examination of this act, then, shows that while in one part of the section provision is
made for officers generally, in another clause there is a class of officers, designated by
their official titles, who are excepted from the general terms of the law, and in reference
to whom a clear distinction is made as to the general power of removal limited in the first
clause of the section.

This distinction is that as to such of these enumerated officers as hold under the appointment
of the President the power of removal can only be exercised by him with the consent of the
Senate, while as to those who have not been appointed by him there is no like denial of his
power to displace them. It would be a violation of the plain meaning of this enactment to place
Mr. Stanton upon the same footing as those heads of Departments who have been appointed by
myself. As to him, this law gives him no tenure of office. The members of my Cabinet who have
been appointed by me are by this act entitled to hold for one month after the term of my office
shall cease; but Mr. Stanton could not, against the wishes of my successor, hold a moment thereafter.
If he were permitted by that successor to hold for the first two weeks, would that successor
have no power to remove him? But the power of my successor over him could be no greater than
my own. If my successor would have the power to remove Mr. Stanton after permitting him to
remain a period of two weeks, because he was not appointed by him, but by his predecessor,
I, who have tolerated Mr. Stanton for more than two years, certainly have the same right to
remove him, and upon the same ground, namely, that he was not appointed by me, but by my predecessor.

Under this construction of the tenure-of-office act, I have never doubted my power to remove
Mr. Stanton.

Whether the act were constitutional or not, it was always my opinion that it did not secure
him from removal. I was, however, aware that there were doubts as to the construction of the
law, and from the first I deemed it desirable that at the earliest possible moment those doubts
should be settled and the true construction of the act fixed by decision of the Supreme Court
of the United States. My order of suspension in August last was intended to place the case
in such a position as would make a resort to a judicial decision both necessary and proper.
My understanding and wishes, however, under that order of suspension were frustrated, and the
late order for Mr. Stanton's removal was a further step toward the accomplishment of that purpose.

I repeat that my own convictions as to the true construction of the law and as to its constitutionality
were well settled and were sustained by every member of my Cabinet, including Mr. Stanton himself.
Upon the question of constitutionality, each one in turn deliberately advised me that the tenure-of-office
act was unconstitutional. Upon the question whether, as to those members who were appointed
by my predecessor, that act took from me the power to remove them, one of those members emphatically
stated in the presence of the others sitting in Cabinet that they did not come within the provisions
of the act, and it was no protection to them. No one dissented from this construction, and
I understood them all to acquiesce in its correctness. In a matter of such grave consequence
I was not disposed to rest upon my own opinions, though fortified by my constitutional advisers.
I have therefore sought to bring the question at as early a day as possible before the Supreme
Court of the United States for final and authoritative decision.

In respect to so much of the resolution as relates to the designation of an officer to act
as Secretary of War ad interim, I have only to say that I have exercised this power under the
provisions of the first section of the act of February 13, 1795, which, so far as they are
applicable to vacancies caused by removals, I understand to be still in force.

The legislation upon the subject of ad interim appointments in the Executive Departments stands,
as to the War Office, as follows:

The second section of the act of the 7th of August, 1789, makes provision for a vacancy in
the very case of a removal of the head of the War Department, and upon such a vacancy gives
the charge and custody of the records, books, and papers to the chief clerk. Next, by the act
of the 8th of May, 1792, section 8, it is provided that in case of a vacancy occasioned by
death, absence from the seat of Government, or sickness of the head of the War Department the
President may authorize a person to perform the duties of the office until a successor is appointed
or the disability removed. The act, it will be observed, does not provide for the case of a
vacancy caused by removal. Then, by the first section of the act of February 13, 1795, it is
provided that in case of any vacancy the President may appoint a person to perform the duties
while the vacancy exists.

These acts are followed by that of the 20th of February, 1863, by the first section of which
provision is again made for a vacancy caused by death, resignation, absence from the seat of
Government, or sickness of the head of any Executive Department of the Government, and upon
the occurrence of such a vacancy power is given to the President--

  to authorize the head of any other Executive Department, or other
  officer in either of said Departments whose appointment is vested in
  the President, at his discretion, to perform the duties of the said
  respective offices until a successor be appointed or until such absence
  or inability by sickness shall cease: Provided, That no one vacancy
  shall be supplied in manner aforesaid for a longer term than six months.

This law, with some modifications, reenacts the act of 1792, and provides, as did that act,
for the sort of vacancies so to be filled; but, like the act of 1792, it makes no provision
for a vacancy occasioned by removal. It has reference altogether to vacancies arising from
other causes.

According to my construction of the act of 1863, while it impliedly repeals the act of 1792
regulating the vacancies therein described, it has no bearing whatever upon so much of the
act of 1795 as applies to a vacancy caused by removal. The act of 1795 therefore furnishes
the rule for a vacancy occasioned by removal--one of the vacancies expressly referred to in
the act of the 7th of August, 1789, creating the Department of War. Certainly there is no express
repeal by the act of 1863 of the act of 1795. The repeal, if there is any, is by implication,
and can only be admitted so far as there is a clear inconsistency between the two acts. The
act of 1795 is inconsistent with that of 1863 as to a vacancy occasioned by death, resignation,
absence, or sickness, but not at all inconsistent as to a vacancy caused by removal.

It is assuredly proper that the President should have the same power to fill temporarily a
vacancy occasioned by removal as he has to supply a place made vacant by death or the expiration
of a term. If, for instance, the incumbent of an office should be found to be wholly unfit
to exercise its functions, and the public service should require his immediate expulsion, a
remedy should exist and be at once applied, and time be allowed the President to select and
appoint a successor, as is permitted him in case of a vacancy caused by death or the termination
of an official term.

The necessity, therefore, for an ad interim appointment is just as great, and, indeed, may
be greater in cases of removal than in any others. Before it be held, therefore, that the power
given by the act of 1795 in cases of removal is abrogated by succeeding legislation an express
repeal ought to appear. So wholesome a power should certainly not be taken away by loose implication.

It may be, however, that in this, as in other cases of implied repeal, doubts may arise. It
is confessedly one of the most subtle and debatable questions which arise in the construction
of statutes. If upon such a question I have fallen into an erroneous construction, I submit
whether it should be characterized as a violation of official duty and of law.

I have deemed it proper, in vindication of the course which I have considered it my duty to
take, to place before the Senate the reasons upon which I have based my action. Although I
have been advised by every member of my Cabinet that the entire tenure-of-office act is unconstitutional,
and therefore void, and although I have expressly concurred in that opinion in the veto message
which I had the honor to submit to Congress when I returned the bill for reconsideration, I
have refrained from making a removal of any officer contrary to the provisions of the law,
and have only exercised that power in the case of Mr. Stanton, which, in my judgment, did not
come within its provisions. I have endeavored to proceed with the greatest circumspection,
and have acted only in an extreme and exceptional case, carefully following the course which
I have marked out for myself as a general rule, faithfully to execute all laws, though passed
over my objections on the score of constitutionality. In the present instance I have appealed,
or sought to appeal, to that final arbiter fixed by the Constitution for the determination
of all such questions. To this course I have been impelled by the solemn obligations which
rest upon me to sustain inviolate the powers of the high office committed to my hands.

Whatever may be the consequences merely personal to myself, I could not allow them to prevail
against a public duty so clear to my own mind, and so imperative. If what was possible had
been certain, if I had been fully advised when I removed Mr. Stanton that in thus defending
the trust committed to my hands my own removal was sure to follow, I could not have hesitated.
Actuated by public considerations of the highest character, I earnestly protest against the
resolution of the Senate which charges me in what I have done with a violation of the Constitution
and laws of the United States.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 18, 1868.

To the Senate and House of Representatives:

Experience has fully demonstrated the wisdom of the framers of the Federal Constitution. Under
all circumstances the result of their labors was as near an approximation to perfection as
was compatible with the fallibility of man. Such being the estimation in which the Constitution
is and has ever been held by our countrymen, it is not surprising that any proposition for
its alteration or amendment should be received with reluctance and distrust. While this sentiment
deserves commendation and encouragement as a useful preventive of unnecessary attempt to change
its provisions, it must be conceded that time has developed imperfections and omissions in
the Constitution, the reformation of which has been demanded by the best interests of the country.
Some of these have been remedied in the manner provided in the Constitution itself. There are
others which, although heretofore brought to the attention of the people, have never been so
presented as to enable the popular judgment to determine whether they should be corrected by
means of additional amendments. My object in this communication is to suggest certain defects
in the Constitution which seem to me to require correction, and to recommend that the judgment
of the people be taken on the amendments proposed.

The first of the defects to which I desire to direct attention is in that clause of the Constitution
which provides for the election of President and Vice-President through the intervention of
electors, and not by an immediate vote of the people. The importance of so amending this clause
as to secure to the people the election of President and Vice-President by their direct votes
was urged with great earnestness and ability by President Jackson in his first annual message,
and the recommendation was repeated in five of his subsequent communications to Congress, extending
through the eight years of his Administration.

He then proceeded to state the objections to an election of President by the House of Representatives,
the most important of which was that the choice of a clear majority of the people might be
easily defeated.

Although this recommendation was repeated with undiminished earnestness in several of his succeeding
messages, yet the proposed amendment was never adopted and submitted to the people by Congress.
The danger of a defeat of the people's choice in an election by the House of Representatives
remains unprovided for in the Constitution, and would be greatly increased if the House of
Representatives should assume the power arbitrarily to reject the votes of a State which might
not be cast in conformity with the wishes of the majority in that body.

But if President Jackson failed to secure the amendment to the Constitution which he urged
so persistently, his arguments contributed largely to the formation of party organizations,
which have effectually avoided the contingency of an election by the House of Representatives.
These organizations, first by a resort to the caucus system of nominating candidates, and afterwards
to State and national conventions, have been successful in so limiting the number of candidates
as to escape the danger of an election by the House of Representatives.

It is clear, however, that in thus limiting the number of candidates the true object and spirit
of the Constitution have been evaded and defeated. It is an essential feature in our republican
system of government that every citizen possessing the constitutional qualifications has a
right to become a candidate for the office of President and Vice-President, and that every
qualified elector has a right to cast his vote for any citizen whom he may regard as worthy
of these offices. But under the party organizations which have prevailed for years these asserted
rights of the people have been as effectually cut off and destroyed as if the Constitution
itself had inhibited their exercise.

The danger of a defeat of the popular choice in an election by the House of Representatives
is no greater than in an election made nominally by the people themselves, when by the laws
of party organizations and by the constitutional provisions requiring the people to vote for
electors instead of for the President or Vice-President it is made impracticable for any citizen
to be a candidate except through the process of a party nomination, and for any voter to cast
his suffrage for any other person than one thus brought forward through the manipulations of
a nominating convention. It is thus apparent that by means of party organizations that provision
of the Constitution which requires the election of President and Vice-President to be made
through the electoral colleges has been made instrumental and potential in defeating the great
object of conferring the choice of these officers upon the people. It may be conceded that
party organizations are inseparable from republican government, and that when formed and managed
in subordination to the Constitution they may be valuable safeguards of popular liberty; but
when they are perverted to purposes of bad ambition they are liable to become the dangerous
instruments of overthrowing the Constitution itself. Strongly impressed with the truth of these
views, I feel called upon by an imperative sense of duty to revive substantially the recommendation
so often and so earnestly made by President Jackson, and to urge that the amendment to the
Constitution herewith presented, or some similar proposition, may be submitted to the people
for their ratification or rejection. It is clear that this should be fixed by the Constitution,
and not be left to repealable enactments of doubtful constitutionality. It occurs to me that
in the event of a vacancy in the office of President by the death, resignation, disability,
or removal of both the President and Vice-President the duties of the office should devolve
upon an officer of the executive department of the Government, rather than one connected with
the legislative or judicial departments. The objections to designating either the President
pro tempore of the Senate or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, especially in the event
of a vacancy produced by removal, are so obvious and so unanswerable that they need not be
stated in detail. It is enough to state that they are both interested in producing a vacancy,
and, according to the provisions of the Constitution, are members of the tribunal by whose
decree a vacancy may be produced.

Under such circumstances the impropriety of designating either of these officers to succeed
the President so removed is palpable. The framers of the Constitution, when they referred to
Congress the settlement of the succession to the office of President in the event of a vacancy
in the offices of both President and Vice-President, did not, in my opinion, contemplate the
designation of any other than an officer of the executive department, on whom, in such a contingency,
the powers and duties of the President should devolve. Until recently the contingency has been
remote, and serious attention has not been called to the manifest incongruity between the provisions
of the Constitution on this subject and the act of Congress of 1792. Having, however, been
brought almost face to face with this important question, it seems an eminently proper time
for us to make the legislation conform to the language, intent, and theory of the Constitution,
and thus place the executive department beyond the reach of usurpation, and remove from the
legislative and judicial departments every temptation to combine for the absorption of all
the powers of government.

It has occurred to me that in the event of such a vacancy the duties of President would devolve
most appropriately upon some one of the heads of the several Executive Departments, and under
this conviction I present for your consideration an amendment to the Constitution on this subject,
with the recommendation that it be submitted to the people for their action.

Experience seems to have established the necessity of an amendment of that clause of the Constitution
which provides for the election of Senators to Congress by the legislatures of the several
States. It would be more consistent with the genius of our form of government if the Senators
were chosen directly by the people of the several States. The objections to the election of
Senators by the legislatures are so palpable that I deem it unnecessary to do more than submit
the proposition for such an amendment, with the recommendation that it be opened to the people
for their judgment.

It is strongly impressed on my mind that the tenure of office by the judiciary of the United
States during good behavior for life is incompatible with the spirit of republican government,
and in this opinion I am fully sustained by the evidence of popular judgment upon this subject
in the different States of the Union.

I therefore deem it my duty to recommend an amendment to the Constitution by which the terms
of the judicial officers would be limited to a period of years, and I herewith present it in
the hope that Congress will submit it to the people for their decision.

The foregoing views have long been entertained by me. In 1845, in the House of Representatives,
and afterwards, in 1860, in the Senate of the United States, I submitted substantially the
same propositions as those to which the attention of Congress is herein invited. Time, observation,
and experience have confirmed these convictions; and, as a matter of public duty and a deep
sense of my constitutional obligation "to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures
as I deem necessary and expedient," I submit the accompanying propositions, and urge their
adoption and submission to the judgment of the people.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

  JOINT RESOLUTION proposing amendments to the Constitution of the
  United States. The Congress of the United
  States shall be in session on the second Monday in October in the year
  18--, and on the same day in every sixth year thereafter; and the
  President of the Senate, in the presence of the Senate and House of
  Representatives, shall open all the certificates, and the votes shall
  then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes for
  President shall be President, if such number be equal to a majority of
  the whole number of votes given; but if no person have such majority,
  then a second election shall be held on the first Thursday in the month
  of December then next ensuing between the persons having the two highest
  numbers for the office of President, which second election shall be
  conducted, the result certified, and the votes counted in the same
  manner as in the first, and the person having the greatest number of
  votes for President shall be President. But if two or more persons shall
  have received the greatest and an equal number of votes at the second
  election, then the person who shall have received the greatest number of
  votes in the greatest number of States shall be President. The person
  having the greatest number of votes for Vice-President at the first
  election shall be Vice-President, if such number be equal to a majority
  of the whole number of votes given; and if no person have such majority,
  then a second election shall take place between the persons having the
  two highest numbers on the same day that the second election is held for
  President, and the person having the highest number of the votes for
  Vice-President shall be Vice-President. But if there should happen to
  be an equality of votes between the persons so voted for at the second
  election, then the person having the greatest number of votes in the
  greatest number of States shall be Vice-President. But when a second
  election shall be necessary in the case of Vice-President and not
  necessary in the case of President, then the Senate shall choose a
  Vice-President from the persons having the two highest numbers in the
  first election, as now prescribed in the Constitution: Provided,
  That after the ratification of this amendment to the Constitution the
  President and Vice-President shall hold their offices, respectively, for
  the term of six years, and that no President or Vice-President shall be
  eligible for reelection to a second term."

  Sec. 2.

  Sec. 3. And be it further resolved, That Article I, section 3, be
  amended by striking out the word "legislature," and inserting in lieu
  thereof the following words, viz: "Persons qualified to vote for members
  of the most numerous branch of the legislature," so as to make the third
  section of said article, when ratified by three-fourths of the States,
  read as follows, to wit:

  "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from
  each State, chosen by the persons qualified to vote for the members of
  the most numerous branch of the legislature thereof, for six years, and
  each Senator shall have one vote."

  Sec. 4. And be it further resolved, That Article III, section I, be
  amended by striking out the words "good behavior," and inserting the
  following words, viz: "the term of twelve years." And further, that said
  article and section be amended by adding the following thereto, viz:
  "And it shall be the duty of the President of the United States, within
  twelve months after the ratification of this amendment by three-fourths
  of all the States, as provided by the Constitution of the United States,
  to divide the whole number of judges, as near as may be practicable,
  into three classes. The seats of the judges of the first class shall be
  vacated at the expiration of the fourth year from such classification,
  of the second class at the expiration of the eighth year, and of the
  third class at the expiration of the twelfth year, so that one-third may
  be chosen every fourth year thereafter."

  The article as amended will read as follows:

  Article III.

  Sec. I. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one
  Supreme Court and such inferior courts as the Congress from time to time
  may ordain and establish. The judges, both of the Supreme and inferior
  courts, shall hold their offices during the term of twelve years, and
  shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which
  shall not be diminished during their continuance in office; and it shall
  be the duty of the President of the United States, within twelve months
  after the ratification of this amendment by three-fourths of all the
  States, as provided by the Constitution of the United States, to divide
  the whole number of judges, as near as may be practicable, into three
  classes. The seats of the judges of the first class shall be vacated at
  the expiration of the fourth year from such classification; of the
  second class, at the expiration of the eighth year; and of the third
  class, at the expiration of the twelfth year, so that one-third may be
  chosen every fourth year thereafter.

[Footnote 69: Relating to absence from his post of the consul at Panama.]

VETO MESSAGES.

WASHINGTON, D.C., March 25, 1868.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have considered, with such care as the pressure of other duties has permitted, a bill entitled
"An act to amend an act entitled 'An act to amend the judiciary act, passed the 24th of September,
1789.'" Not being able to approve all of its provisions, I herewith return it to the Senate,
in which House it originated, with a brief statement of my objections.

The first section of the bill meets my approbation, as, for the purpose of protecting the rights
of property from the erroneous decision of inferior judicial tribunals, it provides means for
obtaining uniformity, by appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, in cases which have
now become very numerous and of much public interest, and in which such remedy is not now allowed.
The second section, however, takes away the right of appeal to that court in cases which involve
the life and liberty of the citizen, and leaves them exposed to the judgment of numerous inferior
tribunals. It is apparent that the two sections were conceived in a very different spirit,
and I regret that my objections to one impose upon me the necessity of withholding my sanction
from the other.

I can not give my assent to a measure which proposes to deprive any person "restrained of his
or her liberty in violation of the Constitution or of any treaty or law of the United States"
from the right of appeal to the highest judicial authority known to our Government. To "secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity" is one of the declared objects of
the Federal Constitution. To assure these, guaranties are provided in the same instrument,
as well against "unreasonable searches and seizures" as against the suspensions of "the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus, * * * unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public
safety may require it." It was doubtless to afford the people the means of protecting and enforcing
these inestimable privileges that the jurisdiction which this bill proposes to take away was
conferred upon the Supreme Court of the nation. The act conferring that jurisdiction was approved
on the 5th day of February, 1867, with a full knowledge of the motives that prompted its passage,
and because it was believed to be necessary and right. Nothing has since occurred to disprove
the wisdom and justness of the measures, and to modify it as now proposed would be to lessen
the protection of the citizen from the exercise of arbitrary power and to weaken the safeguards
of life and liberty, which can never be made too secure against illegal encroachments.

The bill not only prohibits the adjudication by the Supreme Court of cases in which appeals
may hereafter be taken, but interdicts its jurisdiction on appeals which have already been
made to that high judicial body. If, therefore, it should become a law, it will by its retroactive
operation wrest from the citizen a remedy which he enjoyed at the time of his appeal. It will
thus operate most harshly upon those who believe that justice has been denied them in the inferior
courts.

The legislation proposed in the second section, it seems to me, is not in harmony with the
spirit and intention of the Constitution. It can not fail to affect most injuriously the just
equipoise of our system of Government, for it establishes a precedent which, if followed, may
eventually sweep away every check on arbitrary and unconstitutional legislation. Thus far during
the existence of the Government the Supreme Court of the United States has been viewed by the
people as the true expounder of their Constitution, and in the most violent party conflicts
its judgments and decrees have always been sought and deferred to with confidence and respect.
In public estimation it combines judicial wisdom and impartiality in a greater degree than
any other authority known to the Constitution, and any act which may be construed into or mistaken
for an attempt to prevent or evade its decision on a question which affects the liberty of
the citizens and agitates the country can not fail to be attended with unpropitious consequences.
It will be justly held by a large portion of the people as an admission of the unconstitutionally
of the act on which its judgment may be forbidden or forestalled, and may interfere with that
willing acquiescence in its provisions which is necessary for the harmonious and efficient
execution of any law.

For these reasons, thus briefly and imperfectly stated, and for others, of which want of time
forbids the enumeration, I deem it my duty to withhold my assent from this bill, and to return
it for the reconsideration of Congress.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., June 20, 1868.

To the House of Representatives:

I return without my signature a bill entitled "An act to admit the State of Arkansas to representation
in Congress."

The approval of this bill would be an admission on the part of the Executive that the "Act
for the more efficient government of the rebel States," passed March 2, 1867, and the acts
supplementary thereto were proper and constitutional. My opinion, however, in reference to
those measures has undergone no change, but, on the contrary, has been strengthened by the
results which have attended their execution. Even were this not the case, I could not consent
to a bill which is based upon the assumption either that by an act of rebellion of a portion
of its people the State of Arkansas seceded from the Union, or that Congress may at its pleasure
expel or exclude a State from the Union, or interrupt its relations with the Government by
arbitrarily depriving it of representation in the Senate and House of Representatives. If Arkansas
is a State not in the Union, this bill does not admit it as a State into the Union. If, on
the other hand, Arkansas is a State in the Union, no legislation is necessary to declare it
entitled "to representation in Congress as one of the States of the Union." The Constitution
already declares that "each State shall have at least one Representative;" that the Senate
"shall be composed of two Senators from each State," and "that no State, without its consent,
shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."

That instrument also makes each House "the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications
of its own members," and therefore all that is now necessary to restore Arkansas in all its
constitutional relations to the Government is a decision by each House upon the eligibility
of those who, presenting their credentials, claim seats in the respective Houses of Congress.
This is the plain and simple plan of the Constitution; and believing that had it been pursued
when Congress assembled in the month of December, 1865, the restoration of the States would
long since have been completed, I once again earnestly recommend that it be adopted by each
House in preference to legislation, which I respectfully submit is not only of at least doubtful
constitutionality, and therefore unwise and dangerous as a precedent, but is unnecessary, not
so effective in its operation as the mode prescribed by the Constitution, involves additional
delay, and from its terms may be taken rather as applicable to a Territory about to be admitted
as one of the United States than to a State which has occupied a place in the Union for upward
of a quarter of a century.

The bill declares the State of Arkansas entitled and admitted to representation in Congress
as one of the States of the Union upon the following fundamental condition:

  That the constitution of Arkansas shall never be so amended or changed
  as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States of
  the right to vote who are entitled to vote by the constitution herein
  recognized, except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies
  at common law, whereof they shall have been duly convicted under laws
  equally applicable to all the inhabitants of said State: Provided,
  That any alteration of said constitution, prospective in its effect,
  may be made in regard to the time and place of residence of voters.

I have been unable to find in the Constitution of the United States any warrant for the exercise
of the authority thus claimed by Congress. In assuming the power to impose a "fundamental condition"
upon a State which has been duly "admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original
States in all respects whatever," Congress asserts a right to enter a State as it may a Territory,
and to regulate the highest prerogative of a free people--the elective franchise. This question
is reserved by the Constitution to the States themselves, and to concede to Congress the power
to regulate the subject would be to reverse the fundamental principle of the Republic and to
place in the hands of the Federal Government, which is the creature of the States, the sovereignty
which justly belongs to the States or the people--the true source of all political power, by
whom our Federal system was created and to whose will it is subordinate.

The bill fails to provide in what manner the State of Arkansas is to signify its acceptance
of the "fundamental condition" which Congress endeavors to make unalterable and irrevocable.
Nor does it prescribe the penalty to be imposed should the people of the State amend or change
the particular portions of the constitution which it is one of the purposes of the bill to
perpetuate, but as to the consequences of such action leaves them in uncertainty and doubt.
When the circumstances under which this constitution has been brought to the attention of Congress
are considered, it is not unreasonable to suppose that efforts will be made to modify its provisions,
and especially those in respect to which this measure prohibits any alteration. It is seriously
questioned whether the constitution has been ratified by a majority of the persons who, under
the act of March 2, 1867, and the acts supplementary thereto, were entitled to registration
and to vote upon that issue. Section 10 of the schedule provides that--

  No person disqualified from voting or registering under this
  constitution shall vote for candidates for any office, nor shall be
  permitted to vote for the ratification or rejection of the constitution
  at the polls herein authorized.

Assumed to be in force before its adoption, in disregard of the law of Congress, the constitution
undertakes to impose upon the elector other and further conditions. The fifth section of the
eighth article provides that "all persons, before registering or voting," must take and subscribe
an oath which, among others, contains the following clause:

  That I accept the civil and political equality of all men, and agree
  not to attempt to deprive any person or persons, on account of race,
  color, or previous condition, of any political or civil right,
  privilege, or immunity enjoyed by any other class of men.

It is well known that a very large portion of the electors in all the States, if not a large
majority of all of them, do not believe in or accept the political equality of Indians, Mongolians,
or negroes with the race to which they belong. If the voters in many of the States of the North
and West were required to take such an oath as a test of their qualification, there is reason
to believe that a majority of them would remain from the polls rather than comply with its
degrading conditions. How far and to what extent this test oath prevented the registration
of those who were qualified under the laws of Congress it is not possible to know, but that
such was its effect, at least sufficient to overcome the small and doubtful majority in favor
of this constitution, there can be no reasonable doubt. Should the people of Arkansas, therefore,
desiring to regulate the elective franchise so as to make it conform to the constitutions of
a large proportion of the States of the North and West, modify the provisions referred to in
the "fundamental condition," what is to be the consequence? Is it intended that a denial of
representation shall follow? And if so, may we not dread, at some future day, a recurrence
of the troubles which have so long agitated the country? Would it not be the part of wisdom
to take for our guide the Federal Constitution, rather than resort to measures which, looking
only to the present, may in a few years renew, in an aggravated form, the strife and bitterness
caused by legislation which has proved to be so ill timed and unfortunate?

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., June 25, 1868.

To the House of Representatives:

In returning to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, a bill entitled "An act
to admit the States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida
to representation in Congress," I do not deem it necessary to state at length the reasons which
constrain me to withhold my approval. I will not, therefore, undertake at this time to reopen
the discussion upon the grave constitutional questions involved in the act of March 2, 1867,
and the acts supplementary thereto, in pursuance of which it is claimed, in the preamble to
this bill, these States have framed and adopted constitutions of State government. Nor will
I repeat the objections contained in my message of the 20th instant, returning without my signature
the bill to admit to representation the State of Arkansas, and which are equally applicable
to the pending measure.

Like the act recently passed in reference to Arkansas, this bill supersedes the plain and simple
mode prescribed by the Constitution for the admission to seats in the respective Houses of
Senators and Representatives from the several States. It assumes authority over six States
of the Union which has never been delegated to Congress, or is even warranted by previous unconstitutional
legislation upon the subject of restoration. It imposes conditions which are in derogation
of the equal rights of the States, and is founded upon a theory which is subversive of the
fundamental principles of the Government. In the case of Alabama it violates the plighted faith
of Congress by forcing upon that State a constitution which was rejected by the people, according
to the express terms of an act of Congress requiring that a majority of the registered electors
should vote upon the question of its ratification.

For these objections, and many others that might be presented, I can not approve this bill,
and therefore return it for the action of Congress required in such cases by the Federal Constitution.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., July 20, 1868.

To the Senate of the United States:

I have given to the joint resolution entitled "A resolution excluding from the electoral college
the votes of States lately in rebellion which shall not have been reorganized" as careful examination
as I have been able to bestow upon the subject during the few days that have intervened since
the measure was submitted for my approval.

Feeling constrained to withhold my consent, I herewith return the resolution to the Senate,
in which House it originated, with a brief statement of the reasons which have induced my action.
This joint resolution is based upon the assumption that some of the States whose inhabitants
were lately in rebellion are not now entitled to representation in Congress and participation
in the election of President and Vice-President of the United States.

Having heretofore had occasion to give in detail my reasons for dissenting from this view,
it is not necessary at this time to repeat them. It is sufficient to state that I continue
strong in my conviction that the acts of secession, by which a number of the States sought
to dissolve their connection with the other States and to subvert the Union, being unauthorized
by the Constitution and in direct violation thereof, were from the beginning absolutely null
and void. It follows necessarily that when the rebellion terminated the several States which
had attempted to secede continued to be States in the Union, and all that was required to enable
them to resume their relations to the Union was that they should adopt the measures necessary
to their practical restoration as States. Such measures were adopted, and the legitimate result
was that those States, having conformed to all the requirements of the Constitution, resumed
their former relations, and became entitled to the exercise of all the rights guaranteed to
them by its provisions.

The joint resolution under consideration, however, seems to assume that by the insurrectionary
acts of their respective inhabitants those States forfeited their rights as such, and can never
again exercise them except upon readmission into the Union on the terms prescribed by Congress.
If this position be correct, it follows that they were taken out of the Union by virtue of
their acts of secession, and hence that the war waged upon them was illegal and unconstitutional.
We would thus be placed in this inconsistent attitude, that while the war was commenced and
carried on upon the distinct ground that the Southern States, being component parts of the
Union, were in rebellion against the lawful authority of the United States, upon its termination
we resort to a policy of reconstruction which assumes that it was not in fact a rebellion,
but that the war was waged for the conquest of territories assumed to be outside of the constitutional
Union.

The mode and manner of receiving and counting the electoral votes for President and Vice-President
of the United States are in plain and simple terms prescribed by the Constitution. That instrument
imperatively requires that "the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate
and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted."
Congress has, therefore, no power, under the Constitution, to receive the electoral votes or
reject them. The whole power is exhausted when, in the presence of the two Houses, the votes
are counted and the result declared. In this respect the power and duty of the President of
the Senate are, under the Constitution, purely ministerial. When, therefore, the joint resolution
declares that no electoral votes shall be received or counted from States that since the 4th
of March, 1867, have not "adopted a constitution of State government under which a State government
shall have organized," a power is assumed which is nowhere delegated to Congress, unless upon
the assumption that the State governments organized prior to the 4th of March, 1867, were illegal
and void.

The joint resolution, by implication at least, concedes that these States were States by virtue
of their organization prior to the 4th of March, 1867, but denies to them the right to vote
in the election of President and Vice-President of the United States. It follows either that
this assumption of power is wholly unauthorized by the Constitution or that the States so excluded
from voting were out of the Union by reason of the rebellion, and have never been legitimately
restored. Being fully satisfied that they were never out of the Union, and that their relations
thereto have been legally and constitutionally restored, I am forced to the conclusion that
the joint resolution, which deprives them of the right to have their votes for President and
Vice-President received and counted, is in conflict with the Constitution, and that Congress
has no more power to reject their votes than those of the States which have been uniformly
loyal to the Federal Union.

It is worthy of remark that if the States whose inhabitants were recently in rebellion were
legally and constitutionally organized and restored to their rights prior to the 4th of March,
1867, as I am satisfied they were, the only legitimate authority under which the election for
President and Vice-President can be held therein must be derived from the governments instituted
before that period. It clearly follows that all the State governments organized in those States
under act of Congress for that purpose, and under military control, are illegitimate and of
no validity whatever; and in that view the votes cast in those States for President and Vice-President,
in pursuance of acts passed since the 4th of March, 1867, and in obedience to the so-called
reconstruction acts of Congress, can not be legally received and counted, while the only votes
in those States that can be legally cast and counted will be those cast in pursuance of the
laws in force in the several States prior to the legislation by Congress upon the subject of
reconstruction.

I can not refrain from directing your special attention to the declaration contained in the
joint resolution, that "none of the States whose inhabitants were lately in rebellion shall
be entitled to representation in the electoral college," etc. If it is meant by this declaration
that no State is to be allowed to vote for President and Vice-President all of whose inhabitants
were engaged in the late rebellion, it is apparent that no one of the States will be excluded
from voting, since it is well known that in every Southern State there were many inhabitants
who not only did not participate in the rebellion, but who actually took part in the suppression,
or refrained from giving it any aid or countenance. I therefore conclude that the true meaning
of the joint resolution is that no State a portion of whose inhabitants were engaged in the
rebellion shall be permitted to participate in the Presidential election, except upon the terms
and conditions therein prescribed.

Assuming this to be the true construction of the resolution, the inquiry becomes pertinent,
May those Northern States a portion of whose inhabitants were actually in the rebellion be
prevented, at the discretion of Congress, from having their electoral votes counted? It is
well known that a portion of the inhabitants of New York and a portion of the inhabitants of
Virginia were alike engaged in the rebellion; yet it is equally well known that Virginia, as
well as New York, was at all times during the war recognized by the Federal Government as a
State in the Union--so clearly that upon the termination of hostilities it was not even deemed
necessary for her restoration that a provisional governor should be appointed; yet, according
to this joint resolution, the people of Virginia, unless they comply with the terms it prescribes,
are denied the right of voting for President, while the people of New York, a portion of the
inhabitants of which State were also in rebellion, are permitted to have their electoral votes
counted without undergoing the process of reconstruction prescribed for Virginia. New York
is no more a State than Virginia; the one is as much entitled to representation in the electoral
college as the other. If Congress has the power to deprive Virginia of this right, it can exercise
the same authority with respect to New York or any other of the States. Thus the result of
the Presidential election may be controlled and determined by Congress, and the people be deprived
of their right under the Constitution to choose a President and Vice-President of the United
States.

If Congress were to provide by law that the votes of none of the States should be received
and counted if cast for a candidate who differed in political sentiment with a majority of
the two Houses, such legislation would at once be condemned by the country as an unconstitutional
and revolutionary usurpation of power. It would, however, be exceedingly difficult to find
in the Constitution any more authority for the passage of the joint resolution under consideration
than for an enactment looking directly to the rejection of all votes not in accordance with
the political preferences of a majority of Congress. No power exists in the Constitution authorizing
the joint resolution or the supposed law--the only difference being that one would be more
palpably unconstitutional and revolutionary than the other. Both would rest upon the radical
error that Congress has the power to prescribe terms and conditions to the right of the people
of the States to cast their votes for President and Vice-President.

For the reasons thus indicated I am constrained to return the joint resolution to the Senate
for such further action thereon as Congress may deem necessary.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, July 25, 1868

To the Senate of the United States:

Believing that a bill entitled "An act relating to the Freedmen's Bureau, and providing for
its discontinuance," interferes with the appointing power conferred by the Constitution upon
the Executive, and for other reasons, which at this late period of the session time will not
permit me to state, I herewith return it to the Senate, in which House it originated, without
my approval.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

ANDREW JOHNSON. Our highways have been lengthened, and new and prolific regions have been occupied.
We are permitted to hope that long-protracted political and sectional dissensions are at no
distant day to give place to returning harmony and fraternal affection throughout the Republic.
Many foreign states have entered into liberal agreements with us, while nations which are far
off and which heretofore have been unsocial and exclusive have become our friends.

The annual period of rest, which we have reached in health and tranquillity, and which is crowned
with so many blessings, is by universal consent a convenient and suitable one for cultivating
personal piety and practicing public devotion.

I therefore recommend that Thursday, the 26th day of November next, be set apart and observed
by all the people of the United States as a day for public praise, thanksgiving, and prayer
to the Almighty Creator and Divine Ruler of the Universe, by whose ever-watchful, merciful,
and gracious providence alone states and nations, no less than families and individual men,
do live and move and have their being.

ANDREW JOHNSON. This regulation has become necessary for the more convenient, punctual, and
regular dispatch of the public business.

By order of the President:

WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, October 10, 1868.

The following order has been received from the President, and by his direction is published
to the Army:

The following provisions from the Constitution and laws of the United States in relation to
the election of a President and Vice-President of the United States, together with an act of
Congress prohibiting all persons engaged in the military and naval service from interfering
in any general or special election in any State, are published for the information and government
of all concerned:

[Extract from Article II, section 1, Constitution of the United States.]

  The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States
  of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years,
  and, together with the Vice-President, chosen for the same term, be
  elected as follows:

  Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may
  direct, a number of electors equal to the whole number of Senators and
  Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress; but
  no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or
  profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.

[Extract from Article XII, amendment to the Constitution of the United States.]

  The electors shall meet in their respective States and vote by ballot
  for President and Vice-President, one of whom at least shall not be an
  inhabitant of the same State with themselves. They shall name in their
  ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the
  person voted for as Vice-President; and they shall make distinct lists
  of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as
  Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they
  shall sign and certify and transmit sealed to the seat of the Government
  of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The
  President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House
  of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then
  be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes for President
  shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number
  of electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from
  the persons having the highest numbers, not exceeding three, on the list
  of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall
  choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the
  President the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from
  each State having one vote. A quorum for this purpose shall consist of
  a member or members from two-thirds of the States, and a majority of
  all the States shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House of
  Representatives shall not choose a President, whenever the right of
  choice shall devolve upon them, before the 4th day of March next
  following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the
  case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President.

[Extract from "An act relative to the election of a President and Vice-President of the United
States, and declaring the officer who shall act as President in case of vacancies in the offices
both of President and Vice-President," approved March 1, 1792.]

  give their votes on the said first Wednesday in December, at such place

  electors in each State shall make and sign three certificates of all the
  votes by them given, and shall seal up the same, certifying on each that
  a list of the votes of such State for President and Vice-President is
  contained therein, and shall, by writing under their hands or under the
  hands of a majority of them, appoint a person to take charge of and
  deliver to the President of the Senate, at the seat of Government,
  before the first Wednesday in January then next ensuing, one of the said
  certificates; and the said electors shall forthwith forward by the
  post-office to the President of the Senate, at the seat of Government,
  one other of the said certificates, and shall forthwith cause the other
  of the said certificates to be delivered to the judge of that district
  in which the said electors shall assemble.

  each State shall cause three lists of the names of the electors of such
  State to be made and certified, and to be delivered to the electors on
  or before the said first Wednesday in December, and the said electors
  shall annex one of the said lists to each of the lists of their votes.

  Sec. 4. And be it further enacted, That if a list of votes from any
  State shall not have been received at the seat of Government on the said
  first Wednesday in January, that then the Secretary of State shall send
  a special messenger to the district judge in whose custody such list
  shall have been lodged, who shall forthwith transmit the same to the
  seat of Government.

  Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, That Congress shall be in session
  on the second Wednesday in February, 1793, and on the second Wednesday
  in February succeeding every meeting of the electors, and the said
  certificates, or so many of them as shall have been received, shall then
  be opened, the votes counted, and the persons who shall fill the offices
  of President and Vice-President ascertained and declared agreeably to
  the Constitution.

  Sec. 6. And be it further enacted, That in case there shall be no
  President of the Senate at the seat of Government on the arrival of the
  persons intrusted with the list of the votes of the electors, then such
  persons shall deliver the lists of votes in their custody into the
  office of the Secretary of State, to be safely kept and delivered over
  as soon as may be to the President of the Senate.

       *        *        *        *        *

  the Army or Navy of the United States to prescribe or fix, or attempt
  to prescribe or fix, by proclamation, order, or otherwise, the
  qualifications of voters in any State of the United States of America,
  or in any manner to interfere with the freedom of any election in any
  State or with the exercise of the free right of suffrage in any State of
  the United States. Any officer of the Army or Navy of the United States,
  or other person engaged in the civil, military, or naval service of the
  United States, who violates this section of this act shall for every
  such offense be liable to indictment as for a misdemeanor in any court
  of the United States having jurisdiction to hear, try, and determine
  cases of misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall pay a fine not
  exceeding $5,000 and suffer imprisonment in the penitentiary not less
  than three months nor more than five years, at the discretion of the
  court trying the same; and any person convicted as aforesaid shall,
  moreover, be disqualified from holding any office of honor, profit,
  or trust under the Government of the United States: Provided, That
  nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to prevent any
  officers, soldiers, sailors, or marines from exercising the right of
  suffrage in any election district to which he may belong, if otherwise
  qualified according to the laws of the State in which he shall offer
  to vote.

  Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That any officer or person in
  the military or naval service of the United States who shall order or
  advise, or who shall, directly or indirectly, by force, threat, menace,
  intimidation, or otherwise, prevent or attempt to prevent any qualified
  voter of any State of the United States of America from freely
  exercising the right of suffrage at any general or special election
  in any State of the United States, or who shall in like manner compel

of the two countries. An extract from that part of the dispatch of the minister of the United
States at Lima which accompanied the copy referred to, and which relates to it, is also transmitted.
It will be seen from this extract that it is desirable that the decision of the Senate upon

To the Senate of the United States:

I herewith lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon, a treaty concluded

the British dominions to the United States of America.

ANDREW JOHNSON. It is expected that the original of the convention will be forwarded by the

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., January 18, 1869.

To the Senate of the United States:

The resolution adopted on the 5th instant, requesting the President "to transmit to the Senate
a copy of any proclamation of amnesty made by him since the last adjournment of Congress, and
also to communicate to the Senate by what authority of law the same was made," has been received.

I accordingly transmit herewith a copy of a proclamation dated the 25th day of December last.
The authority of law by which it was made is set forth in the proclamation itself, which expressly
affirms that it was issued "by virtue of the power and authority in me vested by the Constitution,
and in the name of the sovereign people of the United States," and proclaims and declares "unconditionally
and without reservation, to all and to every person who, directly or indirectly, participated
in the late insurrection or rebellion, a full pardon and amnesty for the offense of treason
against the United States, or of adhering to their enemies during the late civil war, with
restoration of all rights, privileges, and immunities under the Constitution and the laws which
have been made in pursuance thereof."

The Federal Constitution is understood to be and is regarded by the Executive as the supreme
law of the land. The second section of article second of that instrument provides that the
President "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United
States, except in cases of impeachment." The proclamation of the 25th ultimo is in strict accordance
with the judicial expositions of the authority thus conferred upon the Executive, and, as will
be seen by reference to the accompanying papers, is in conformity with the precedent established
by Washington in 1795, and followed by President Adams in 1800, Madison in 1815, and Lincoln
in 1863, and by the present Executive in 1865, 1867, and 1868.

WASHINGTON, January 20, 1869.

and Georgetown" is herewith returned to the Senate, in which House it originated, without my
approval.

The accompanying paper exhibits the fact that the legislation which the bill proposes is contrary
to the wishes of the colored residents of Washington and Georgetown, and that they prefer that
the schools for their children should be under the management of trustees selected by the Secretary
of the Interior, whose term of office is for four years, rather than subject to the control
of bodies whose tenure of office, depending merely upon political considerations, may be annually
affected by the elections which take place in the two cities.

The colored people of Washington and Georgetown are at present not represented by a person
of their own race in either of the boards of trustees of public schools appointed by the municipal
authorities. Of the three trustees, however, who, under the act of July 11, 1862, compose the
board of trustees of the schools for colored children, two are persons of color. The resolutions
transmitted herewith show that they have performed their trust in a manner entirely satisfactory
to the colored people of the two cities, and no good reason is known to the Executive why the
duties which now devolve upon them should be transferred as proposed in the bill.

With these brief suggestions the bill is respectfully returned, and the consideration of Congress
invited to the accompanying preamble and resolutions.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, D.C., February 22, 1869.

To the House of Representatives:

The accompanying bill, entitled "An act regulating the duties on imported copper and copper
ores," is, for the following reasons, returned, without my approval, to the House of Representatives,
in which branch of Congress it originated.

Its immediate effect will be to diminish the public receipts, for the object of the bill can
not be accomplished without seriously affecting the importation of copper and copper ores,
from which a considerable revenue is at present derived. While thus impairing the resources
of the Government, it imposes an additional tax upon an already overburdened people, who should
not be further impoverished that monopolies may be fostered and corporations enriched.

It is represented--and the declaration seems to be sustained by evidence--that the duties for
which this bill provides are nearly or quite sufficient to prohibit the importation of certain
foreign ores of copper. Its enactment, therefore, will prove detrimental to the shipping interests
of the nation, and at the same time destroy the business, for many years successfully established,
of smelting home ores in connection with a smaller amount of the imported articles. This business,
it is credibly asserted, has heretofore yielded the larger share of the copper production of
the country, and thus the industry which this legislation is designed to encourage is actually
less than that which will be destroyed by the passage of this bill.

It seems also to be evident that the effect of this measure will be to enhance by 70 per cent
the cost of blue vitriol--an article extensively used in dyeing and in the manufacture of printed
and colored cloths. To produce such an augmentation in the price of this commodity will be
to discriminate against other great branches of domestic industry, and by increasing their
cost to expose them most unfairly to the effects of foreign competition. Legislation can neither
be wise nor just which seeks the welfare of a single interest at the expense and to the injury
of many and varied interests at least equally important and equally deserving the consideration
of Congress. Indeed, it is difficult to find any reason which will justify the interference
of Government with any legitimate industry, except so far as may be rendered necessary by the
requirements of the revenue. As has already been stated, however, the legislative intervention
proposed in the present instance will diminish, not increase, the public receipts.

The enactment of such a law is urged as necessary for the relief of certain mining interests
upon Lake Superior, which, it is alleged, are in a greatly depressed condition, and can only
be sustained by an enhancement of the price of copper. If this result should follow the passage
of the bill, a tax for the exclusive benefit of a single class would be imposed upon the consumers
of copper throughout the entire country, not warranted by any need of the Government, and the
avails of which would not in any degree find their way into the Treasury of the nation. If
the miners of Lake Superior are in a condition of want, it can not be justly affirmed that
the Government should extend charity to them in preference to those of its citizens who in
other portions of the country suffer in like manner from destitution. Least of all should the
endeavor to aid them be based upon a method so uncertain and indirect as that contemplated
by the bill, and which, moreover, proposes to continue the exercise of its benefaction through
an indefinite period of years. It is, besides, reasonable to hope that positive suffering from
want, if it really exists, will prove but temporary in a region where agricultural labor is
so much in demand and so well compensated. A careful examination of the subject appears to
show that the present low price of copper, which alone has induced any depression the mining
interests of Lake Superior may have recently experienced, is due to causes which it is wholly
impolitic, if not impracticable, to contravene by legislation. These causes are, in the main,
an increase in the general supply of copper, owing to the discovery and working of remarkably
productive mines and to a coincident restriction in the consumption and use of copper by the
substitution of other and cheaper metals for industrial purposes. It is now sought to resist
by artificial means the action of natural laws; to place the people of the United States, in
respect to the enjoyment and use of an essential commodity, upon a different basis from other
nations, and especially to compensate certain private and sectional interests for the changes
and losses which are always incident to industrial progress.

Although providing for an increase of duties, the proposed law does not even come within the
range of protection, in the fair acceptation of the term. It does not look to the fostering
of a young and feeble interest with a view to the ultimate attainment of strength and the capacity
of self-support. It appears to assume that the present inability for successful production
is inherent and permanent, and is more likely to increase than to be gradually overcome; yet
in spite of this it proposes, by the exercise of the lawmaking power, to sustain that interest
and to impose it in hopeless perpetuity as a tax upon the competent and beneficent industries
of the country.

The true method for the mining interests of Lake Superior to obtain relief, if relief is needed,
is to endeavor to make their great natural resources fully available by reducing the cost of
production. Special or class legislation can not remedy the evils which this bill is designed
to meet. They can only be overcome by laws which will effect a wise, honest, and economical
administration of the Government, a reestablishment of the specie standard of value, and an
early adjustment of our system of State, municipal, and national taxation (especially the latter)
upon the fundamental principle that all taxes, whether collected under the internal revenue
or under a tariff, shall interfere as little as possible with the productive energies of the
people.

The bill is therefore returned, in the belief that the true interests of the Government and
of the people require that it should not become a law.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

PROCLAMATION.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas the President of the United States has heretofore set forth several proclamations offering
amnesty and pardon to persons who had been or were concerned in the late rebellion against
the lawful authority of the Government of the United States, which proclamations were severally
issued on the 8th day of December, 1863, on the 26th day of March, 1864, on the 29th day of
May, 1865, on the 7th day of September, 1867, and on the 4th day of July, in the present year; and

Whereas the authority of the Federal Government having been reestablished in all the States
and Territories within the jurisdiction of the United States, it is believed that such prudential
reservations and exceptions as at the dates of said several proclamations were deemed necessary
and proper may now be wisely and justly relinquished, and that an universal amnesty and pardon
for participation in said rebellion extended to all who have borne any part therein will tend
to secure permanent peace, order, and prosperity throughout the land, and to renew and fully
restore confidence and fraternal feeling among the whole people, and their respect for and
attachment to the National Government, designed by its patriotic founders for the general good:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, by virtue
of the power and authority in me vested by the Constitution and in the name of the sovereign
people of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare, unconditionally and without reservation,
to all and to every person who, directly or indirectly, participated in the late insurrection
or rebellion a full pardon and amnesty for the offense of treason against the United States
or of adhering to their enemies during the late civil war, with restoration of all rights,
privileges, and immunities under the Constitution and the laws which have been made in pursuance
thereof.

In testimony whereof I have signed these presents with my hand and have caused the seal of
the United States to be hereunto affixed.

[SEAL.]

Done at the city of Washington, the 25th day of December, A.D. 1868, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the ninety-third.

  F.W. SEWARD,
    Acting Secretary of State.

IMPEACHMENT OF ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

On the 24th of February, 1868, the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States
resolved to impeach Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors,
of which the Senate was apprised, and arrangements were made for the trial. On the 2d and 3d

4th they were presented to the Senate by the managers on the part of the House, Mr. John A.
Bingham, Mr. George S. Boutwell, Mr. James F. Wilson, Mr. Benjamin F. Butler, Mr. Thomas Williams,

A.D. 1868, at Washington, in the District of Columbia, unmindful of the high duties of his

and laws of the United States issue an order in writing for the removal of Edwin M. Stanton
from the office of Secretary for the Department of War, said Edwin M. Stanton having been theretofore
duly appointed and commissioned, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United
States, as such Secretary; and said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, on the

SCHUYLER COLFAX,

Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Attest:

EDWARD McPHERSON,

Clerk of the House of Representatives.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, UNITED STATES, March 3, 1868.

The following additional articles of impeachment were agreed to, viz:

ART. X. That said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, unmindful of the high duties
of his office and the dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony and courtesies which
ought to exist and be maintained between the executive and legislative branches of the Government
of the United States, designing and intending to set aside the rightful authority and powers
of Congress, did attempt to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and reproach the
Congress of the United States and the several branches thereof, to impair and destroy the regard
and respect of all the good people of the United States for the Congress and legislative power
thereof (which all officers of the Government ought inviolably to preserve and maintain), and
to excite the odium and resentment of all the good people of the United States against Congress
and the laws by it duly and constitutionally enacted; and, in pursuance of his design and intent,
openly and publicly, and before divers assemblages of the citizens of the United States, convened
in divers parts thereof to meet and receive said Andrew Johnson as the Chief Magistrate of
the United States, did, on the 18th day of August, A.D. 1866, and on divers other days and
times, as well before as afterwards, make and deliver with a loud voice certain intemperate,
inflammatory, and scandalous harangues, and did therein utter loud threats and bitter menaces,
as well against Congress as the laws of the United States, duly enacted thereby, amid the cries,
jeers, and laughter of the multitudes then assembled and in hearing, which are set forth in
the several specifications hereinafter written in substance and effect; that is to say:

Specification first.--In this, that at Washington, in the District of Columbia, in the Executive
Mansion, to a committee of citizens who called upon the President of the United States, speaking
of and concerning the Congress of the United States, said Andrew Johnson, President of the
United States, heretofore, to wit, on the 18th day of August, A.D. 1866, did in a loud voice
declare in substance and effect, among other things; that is to say:

  So far as the executive department of the Government is concerned, the
  effort has been made to restore the Union, to heal the breach, to pour
  oil into the wounds which were consequent upon the struggle, and (to
  speak in common phrase) to prepare, as the learned and wise physician
  would, a plaster healing in character and coextensive with the wound.
  We thought and we think that we had partially succeeded; but as the work
  progresses, as reconstruction seemed to be taking place and the country
  was becoming reunited, we found a disturbing and marring element
  opposing us. In alluding to that element I shall go no further than your
  convention and the distinguished gentleman who has delivered to me the
  report of its proceedings. I shall make no reference to it that I do not
  believe the time and the occasion justify.

  We have witnessed in one department of the Government every endeavor
  to prevent the restoration of peace, harmony, and union. We have seen
  hanging upon the verge of the Government, as it were, a body called, or
  which assumes to be, the Congress of the United States, while in fact it
  is a Congress of only a part of the States. We have seen this Congress
  pretend to be for the Union, when its every step and act tended to
  perpetuate disunion and make a disruption of the States inevitable.
  * * * We have seen Congress gradually encroach, step by step, upon
  constitutional rights, and violate, day after day and month after month,
  fundamental principles of the Government. We have seen a Congress that
  seemed to forget that there was a limit to the sphere and scope of
  legislation. We have seen a Congress in a minority assume to exercise
  power which, allowed to be consummated, would result in despotism or
  monarchy itself.

Specification second.--In this, that at Cleveland, in the State of Ohio, heretofore, to wit,
on the 3d day of September, A.D. 1866, before a public assemblage of citizens and others, said
Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, speaking of and concerning the Congress of
the United States, did in a loud voice declare in substance and effect, among other things;
that is to say:

  I will tell you what I did do. I called upon your Congress that is
  trying to break up the Government.

  In conclusion, besides that, Congress had taken much pains to poison
  their constituents against him. But what had Congress done? Have they
  done anything to restore the Union of these States? No. On the contrary,
  they have done everything to prevent it. And because he stood now where
  he did when the rebellion commenced, he had been denounced as a traitor.
  Who had run greater risks or made greater sacrifices than himself? But
  Congress, factious and domineering, had undertaken to poison the minds
  of the American people.

Specification third.--In this, that at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, heretofore, to
wit, on the 8th day of September, A.D. 1866, before a public assemblage of citizens and others,
said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, speaking of and concerning the Congress
of the United States, did in a loud voice declare in substance and effect, among other things;
that is to say:

  Go on. Perhaps if you had a word or two on the subject of New Orleans
  you might understand more about it than you do. And if you will go
  back--if you will go back and ascertain the cause of the riot at New
  Orleans, perhaps you will not be so prompt in calling out "New Orleans."
  If you will take up the riot at New Orleans and trace it back to its
  source or its immediate cause, you will find out who was responsible
  for the blood that was shed there. If you will take up the riot at New
  Orleans and trace it back to the Radical Congress, you will find that
  the riot at New Orleans was substantially planned. If you will take up
  the proceedings in their caucuses, you will understand that they there
  knew that a convention was to be called which was extinct by its power
  having expired; that it was said that the intention was that a new
  government was to be organized, and on the organization of that
  government the intention was to enfranchise one portion of the
  population, called the colored population, who had just been
  emancipated, and at the same time disfranchise white men. When you
  design to talk about New Orleans, you ought to understand what you are
  talking about. When you read the speeches that were made and take up
  the facts on the Friday and Saturday before that convention sat, you
  will there find that speeches were made, incendiary in their character,
  exciting that portion of the population--the black population--to arm
  themselves and prepare for the shedding of blood. You will also find
  that that convention did assemble, in violation of law, and the
  intention of that convention was to supersede the reorganized
  authorities in the State government of Louisiana, which had been
  recognized by the Government of the United States; and every man engaged
  in that rebellion in that convention, with the intention of superseding
  and upturning the civil government which had been recognized by the
  Government of the United States, I say that he was a traitor to the
  Constitution of the United States; and hence you find that another
  rebellion was commenced, having its origin in the Radical Congress.

       *       *       *       *       *

  So much for the New Orleans riot. And there was the cause and the origin
  of the blood that was shed; and every drop of blood that was shed is
  upon their skirts, and they are responsible for it. I could test this
  thing a little closer, but will not do it here to-night. But when you
  talk about the causes and consequences that resulted from proceedings
  of that kind, perhaps, as I have been introduced here, and you have
  provoked questions of this kind--though it does not provoke me--I will
  tell you a few wholesome things that have been done by this Radical
  Congress in connection with New Orleans and the extension of the
  elective franchise.

  I know that I have been traduced and abused. I know it has come in
  advance of me, here as elsewhere, that I have attempted to exercise an
  arbitrary power in resisting laws that were intended to be forced upon
  the Government; that I had exercised that power; that I had abandoned
  the party that elected me, and that I was a traitor, because I exercised
  the veto power in attempting and did arrest for a time a bill that was
  called a "Freedmen's Bureau" bill; yes, that I was a traitor. And I have
  been traduced, I have been slandered, I have been maligned, I have been
  called Judas Iscariot and all that. Now, my countrymen, here to-night,
  it is very easy to indulge in epithets; it is easy to call a man a Judas
  and cry out "traitor;" but when he is called upon to give arguments and
  facts he is very often found wanting. Judas Iscariot--Judas. There was
  a Judas, and he was one of the twelve apostles. Oh, yes; the twelve
  apostles had a Christ. The twelve apostles had a Christ, and he never
  could have had a Judas unless he had had twelve apostles. If I have
  played the Judas, who has been my Christ that I have played the Judas
  with? Was it Thad. Stevens? Was it Wendell Phillips? Was it Charles
  Sumner? These are the men that stop and compare themselves with the
  Savior, and everybody that differs with them in opinion, and to try
  to stay and arrest their diabolical and nefarious policy, is to be
  denounced as a Judas.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Well, let me say to you, if you will stand by me in this action, if you
  will stand by me in trying to give the people a fair chance--soldiers
  and citizens--to participate in these offices, God being willing I will
  kick them out. I will kick them out just as fast as I can.

  Let me say to you in concluding that what I have said I intended to say.
  I was not provoked into this, and I care not for their menaces, the
  taunts and the jeers. I care not for threats. I do not intend to be
  bullied by my enemies nor overawed by my friends. But, God willing, with
  your help I will veto their measures whenever any of them come to me.

which said utterances, declarations, threats, and harangues, highly censurable in any, are
peculiarly indecent and unbecoming in the Chief Magistrate of the United States, by means whereof
said Andrew Johnson has brought the high office of the President of the United States into
contempt, ridicule, and disgrace, to the great scandal of all good citizens; whereby said Andrew
Johnson, President of the United States, did commit and was then and there guilty of a high
misdemeanor in office.

ART. XI.

SCHUYLER COLFAX,

Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Attest:

EDWARD McPHERSON,

Clerk of the House of Representatives.

IN THE SENATE, March 4, 1868.

The President pro tempore laid before the Senate the following letter from the Hon. Salmon
P. Chase, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States:

WASHINGTON, March 4, 1868.

To the Senate of the United States:

Inasmuch as the sole power to try impeachments is vested by the Constitution in the Senate,
and it is made the duty of the Chief Justice to preside when the President is on trial, I take
the liberty of submitting, very respectfully, some observations in respect to the proper mode
of proceeding upon the impeachment which has been preferred by the House of Representatives
against the President now in office.

That when the Senate sits for the trial of an impeachment it sits as a court seems unquestionable.

That for the trial of an impeachment of the President this court must be constituted of the
members of the Senate, with the Chief Justice presiding, seems equally unquestionable.

The Federalist is regarded as the highest contemporary authority on the construction of the
Constitution, and in the sixty-fourth number the functions of the Senate "sitting in their
judicial capacity as a court for the trial of impeachments" are examined.

In a paragraph explaining the reasons for not uniting "the Supreme Court with the Senate in
the formation of the court of impeachments" it is observed that--

  To a certain extent the benefits of that union will be obtained from
  making the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the president of the court
  of impeachments, as is proposed by the plan of the Convention, while the
  inconveniences of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter
  will be substantially avoided. This was, perhaps, the prudent mean.

This authority seems to leave no doubt upon either of the propositions just stated; and the
statement of them will serve to introduce the question upon which I think it my duty to state
the result of my reflections to the Senate, namely, At what period, in the case of an impeachment
of the President, should the court of impeachment be organized under oath, as directed by the
Constitution?

It will readily suggest itself to anyone who reflects upon the abilities and the learning in
the law which distinguish so many Senators that besides the reason assigned in the Federalist
there must have been still another for the provision requiring the Chief Justice to preside
in the court of impeachment. Under the Constitution, in case of a vacancy in the office of
President, the Vice-President succeeds, and it was doubtless thought prudent and befitting
that the next in succession should not preside in a proceeding through which a vacancy might
be created.

It is not doubted that the Senate, while sitting in its ordinary capacity, must necessarily
receive from the House of Representatives some notice of its intention to impeach the President
at its bar, but it does not seem to me an unwarranted opinion, in view of this constitutional
provision, that the organization of the Senate as a court of impeachment, under the Constitution,
should precede the actual announcement of the impeachment on the part of the House.

And it may perhaps be thought a still less unwarranted opinion that articles of impeachment
should only be presented to a court of impeachment; that no summons or other process should
issue except from the organized court, and that rules for the government of the proceedings
of such a court should be framed only by the court itself.

I have found myself unable to come to any other conclusions than these. I can assign no reason
for requiring the Senate to organize as a court under any other than its ordinary presiding
officer for the latter proceedings upon an impeachment of the President which does not seem
to me to apply equally to the earlier.

I am informed that the Senate has proceeded upon other views, and it is not my purpose to contest
what its superior wisdom may have directed.

All good citizens will fervently pray that no occasion may ever arise when the grave proceedings
now in progress will be cited as a precedent; but it is not impossible that such an occasion
may come.

Inasmuch, therefore, as the Constitution has charged the Chief Justice with an important function
in the trial of an impeachment of the President, it has seemed to me fitting and obligatory,
where he is unable to concur in the views of the Senate concerning matters essential to the
trial, that his respectful dissent should appear.

S.P. CHASE,

Chief Justice of the United States.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE SENATE SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE IMPEACHMENT OF ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1868.

THE UNITED STATES vs. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.

The Chief Justice of the United States entered the Senate Chamber and was conducted to the
chair by the committee appointed by the Senate for that purpose.

The following oath was administered to the Chief Justice by Associate Justice Nelson, and by
the Chief Justice to the members of the Senate:

I do solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Andrew
Johnson, President of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial justice according
to the Constitution and laws. So help me God.

FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1868.

THE UNITED STATES vs. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.

To accord with the conviction of the Chief Justice[76] that the court should adopt its own
rules, those adopted on March 2 by the Senate sitting in its legislative capacity were readopted
by the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment. The rules are as follows:

[Footnote 76: See letter from the Chief Justice, pp. 718-720.]

RULES OF PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE IN THE SENATE WHEN SITTING ON THE TRIAL OF IMPEACHMENTS.

I. Whensoever the Senate shall receive notice from the House of Representatives that managers
are appointed on their part to conduct an impeachment against any person, and are directed
to carry articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate shall immediately
inform the House of Representatives that the Senate is ready to receive the managers for the
purpose of exhibiting such articles of impeachment agreeably to said notice.

II. When the managers of an impeachment shall be introduced at the bar of the Senate and shall
signify that they are ready to exhibit articles of impeachment against any person, the Presiding
Officer of the Senate shall direct the Sergeant-at-Arms to make proclamation, who shall, after
making proclamation, repeat the following words, viz:

  All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment,
  while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the
  United States articles of impeachment against -------- --------.

after which the articles shall be exhibited; and then the Presiding Officer of the Senate shall
inform the managers that the Senate will take proper order on the subject of the impeachment,
of which due notice shall be given to the House of Representatives.

III. Upon such articles being presented to the Senate, the Senate shall, at 1 o'clock afternoon
of the day (Sunday excepted) following such presentation, or sooner if so ordered by the Senate,
proceed to the consideration of such articles, and shall continue in session from day to day
(Sundays excepted) after the trial shall commence (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate)
until final judgment shall be rendered, and so much longer as may in its judgment be needful.
Before proceeding to the consideration of the articles of impeachment the Presiding Officer
shall administer the oath hereinafter provided to the members of the Senate then present, and
to the other members of the Senate as they shall appear, whose duty it shall be to take the same.

IV. When the President of the United States, or the Vice-President of the United States upon
whom the powers and duties of the office of President shall have devolved, shall be impeached,
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States shall preside; and in a case requiring
the said Chief Justice to preside notice shall be given to him by the Presiding Officer of
the Senate of the time and place fixed for the consideration of the articles of impeachment
as aforesaid, with a request to attend; and the said Chief Justice shall preside over the Senate
during the consideration of said articles and upon the trial of the person impeached therein.

V. The Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue, by himself or by the Secretary
of the Senate, all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts authorized by these rules or by the
Senate, and to make and enforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the Senate
may authorize or provide.

VI. The Senate shall have power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to enforce obedience
to its orders, mandates, writs, precepts, and judgments, to preserve order, and to punish in
a summary way contempts of and disobedience to its authority, orders, mandates, writs, precepts,
or judgments, and to make all lawful orders, rules, and regulations which it may deem essential
or conducive to the ends of justice; and the Sergeant-at-Arms, under the direction of the Senate,
may employ such aid and assistance as may be necessary to enforce, execute, and carry into
effect the lawful orders, mandates, writs, and precepts of the Senate.

VII. The Presiding Officer of the Senate shall direct all necessary preparations in the Senate
Chamber, and the presiding officer upon the trial shall direct all the forms of proceeding
while the Senate are sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment and all forms during
the trial not otherwise specially provided for. The presiding officer may, in the first instance,
submit to the Senate, without a division, all questions of evidence and incidental questions;
but the same shall, on the demand of one-fifth of the members present, be decided by yeas and nays.

VIII. Upon the presentation of articles of impeachment and the organization of the Senate as
hereinbefore provided, a writ of summons shall issue to the accused, reciting said articles
and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the
Senate, and named in such writ, and file his answer to said articles of impeachment, and to
stand to and abide the orders and judgments of the Senate thereon, which writ shall be served
by such officer or person as shall be named in the precept thereof such number of days prior
to the day fixed for such appearance as shall be named in such precept, either by the delivery
of an attested copy thereof to the person accused or, if that can not conveniently be done,
by leaving such copy at the last known place of abode of such person or at his usual place
of business, in some conspicuous place therein; or, if such service shall be, in the judgment
of the Senate, impracticable, notice to the accused to appear shall be given in such other
manner, by publication or otherwise, as shall be deemed just; and if the writ aforesaid shall
fail of service in the manner aforesaid, the proceedings shall not thereby abate, but further
service may be made in such manner as the Senate shall direct. If the accused, after service,
shall fail to appear, either in person or by attorney, on the day so fixed therefor as aforesaid,
or, appearing, shall fail to file his answer to such articles of impeachment, the trial shall
proceed, nevertheless, as upon a plea of not guilty. If a plea of guilty shall be entered,
judgment may be entered thereon without further proceedings.

IX. At 12 o'clock and 30 minutes afternoon of the day appointed for the return of the summons
against the person impeached the legislative and executive business of the Senate shall be
suspended and the Secretary of the Senate shall administer an oath to the returning officer
in the form following, viz:

  I, -------- --------, do solemnly swear that the return made by me
  upon the process issued on the ---- day of ---- by the Senate of the
  United States against -------- -------- is truly made, and that I have
  performed such service as herein described.

  So help me God.

which oath shall be entered at large on the records.

X. The person impeached shall then be called to appear and answer the articles of impeachment
against him. If he appear, or any person for him, the appearance shall be recorded, stating
particularly if by himself or by agent or attorney, naming the person appearing and the capacity
in which he appears, If he do not appear, either personally or by agent or attorney, the same
shall be recorded.

XI. At 12 o'clock and 30 minutes afternoon of the day appointed for the trial of an impeachment
the legislative and executive business of the Senate shall be suspended and the Secretary shall
give notice to the House of Representatives that the Senate is ready to proceed upon the impeachment
of -------- --------, in the Senate Chamber, which chamber is prepared with accommodations
for the reception of the House of Representatives.

XII. The hour of the day at which the Senate shall sit upon the trial of an impeachment shall
be (unless otherwise ordered) 12 o'clock m., and when the hour for such sitting shall arrive
the Presiding Officer of the Senate shall so announce; and thereupon the presiding officer
upon such trial shall cause proclamation to be made, and the business of the trial shall proceed.
The adjournment of the Senate sitting in said trial shall not operate as an adjournment of
the Senate, but on such adjournment the Senate shall resume the consideration of its legislative
and executive business.

XIII. The Secretary of the Senate shall record the proceedings in cases of impeachment as in
the case of legislative proceedings, and the same shall be reported in the same manner as the
legislative proceedings of the Senate.

XIV. Counsel for the parties shall be admitted to appear and be heard upon an impeachment.

XV. All motions made by the parties or their counsel shall be addressed to the presiding officer,
and if he or any Senator shall require it they shall be committed to writing and read at the
Secretary's table.

XVI. Witnesses shall be examined by one person on behalf of the party producing them and then
cross-examined by one person on the other side.

XVII. If a Senator is called as a witness, he shall be sworn and give his testimony standing
in his place.

XVIII. If a Senator wishes a question to be put to a witness, or to offer a motion or order
(except a motion to adjourn), it shall be reduced to writing and put by the presiding officer.

XIX. At all times while the Senate is sitting upon the trial of an impeachment the doors of
the Senate shall be kept open, unless the Senate shall direct the doors to be closed while
deliberating upon its decisions.

XX. All preliminary or interlocutory questions and all motions shall be argued for not exceeding
one hour on each side, unless the Senate shall by order extend the time.

XXI. The case on each side shall be opened by one person. The final argument on the merits
may be made by two persons on each side (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate, upon application
for that purpose), and the argument shall be opened and closed on the part of the House of
Representatives.

XXII. On the final question whether the impeachment is sustained the yeas and nays shall be
taken on each article of impeachment separately, and if the impeachment shall not, upon any
of the articles presented, be sustained by the votes of two-thirds of the members present a
judgment of acquittal shall be entered; but if the person accused in such articles of impeachment
shall be convicted upon any of said articles by the votes of two-thirds of the members present
the Senate shall proceed to pronounce judgment, and a certified copy of such judgment shall
be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State.

XXIII. All the orders and decisions shall be made and had by yeas and nays, which shall be
entered on the record, and without debate, except when the doors shall be closed for deliberation,
and in that case no member shall speak more than once on one question, and for not more than
ten minutes on an interlocutory question, and for not more than fifteen minutes on the final
question, unless by consent of the Senate, to be had without debate; but a motion to adjourn
may be decided without the yeas and nays, unless they be demanded by one-fifth of the members
present.

XXIV. Witnesses shall be sworn in the following form, viz:

  You, -------- --------, do swear (or affirm, as the case maybe) that
  the evidence you shall give in the case now depending between the
  United States and -------- -------- shall be the truth, the whole
  truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God.

FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1868.

THE UNITED STATES vs. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.

Mr. Henry Stanbery, in behalf of Andrew Johnson, the respondent, read the following paper:

In the matter of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States.

Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE: I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, having been served with
a summons to appear before this honorable court, sitting as a court of impeachment, to answer
certain articles of impeachment found and presented against me by the honorable the House of
Representatives of the United States, do hereby enter my appearance by my counsel, Henry Stanbery,
Benjamin R. Curtis, Jeremiah S. Black, William M. Evarts, and Thomas A.R. Nelson, who have
my warrant and authority therefor, and who are instructed by me to ask of this honorable court
a reasonable time for the preparation of my answer to said articles. After a careful examination
of the articles of impeachment and consultation with my counsel, I am satisfied that at least
forty days will be necessary for the preparation of my answer, and I respectfully ask that
it be allowed.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

Mr. Stanbery then submitted the following motion:

In the matter of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States.

Henry Stanbery, Benjamin R. Curtis, Jeremiah S. Black, William M. Evarts, and Thomas A.R. Nelson,
of counsel for the respondent, move the court for the allowance of forty days for the preparation
of the answer to the articles of impeachment, and in support of the motion make the following
professional statement:

The articles are eleven in number, involving many questions of law and fact. We have during
the limited time and opportunity afforded us considered as far as possible the field of investigation
which must be explored in the preparation of the answer, and the conclusion at which we have
arrived is that with the utmost diligence the time we have asked is reasonable and necessary.

The precedents as to time for answer upon impeachments before the Senate to which we have had
opportunity to refer are those of Judge Chase and Judge Peck.

In the case of Judge Chase time was allowed from the 3d of January until the 4th of February
next succeeding to put in his answer--a period of thirty-two days; but in this case there were
only eight articles, and Judge Chase had been for a year cognizant of most of the articles,
and had been himself engaged in preparing to meet them.

In the case of Judge Peck there was but a single article. Judge Peck asked for time from the
10th to the 25th of May to put in his answer, and it was granted. It appears that Judge Peck
had been long cognizant of the ground laid for his impeachment, and had been present before
the committee of the House upon the examination of the witnesses, and had been permitted by
the House of Representatives to present to that body an elaborate answer to the charges.

It is apparent that the President is fairly entitled to more time than was allowed in either
of the foregoing cases. It is proper to add that the respondents in these cases were lawyers,
fully capable of preparing their own answers, and that no pressing official duties interfered
with their attention to that business; whereas the President, not being a lawyer, must rely
on his counsel. The charges involve his acts, declarations, and intentions, as to all which
his counsel must be fully advised upon consultation with him, step by step, in the preparation
of his defense. It is seldom that a case requires such constant communication between client
and counsel as this, and yet such communication can only be had at such intervals as are allowed
to the President from the usual hours that must be devoted to his high official duties.

We further beg leave to suggest for the consideration of this honorable court that, as counsel
careful as well of their own reputation as of the interests of their client in a case of such
magnitude as this, so out of the ordinary range of professional experience, where so much responsibility
is felt, they submit to the candid consideration of the court that they have a right to ask
for themselves such opportunity to discharge their duty as seems to them to be absolutely necessary.

  HENRY STANBERY,
  B.R. CURTIS,
  JEREMIAH S. BLACK, \ Per H.S.
  WILLIAM M. EVARTS, /
  THOMAS A.R. NELSON,

Of Counsel for the Respondent.

The above motion was denied, and the Senate adopted the following orders:

Ordered, That the respondent file answer to the articles of impeachment on or before Monday,
the 23d day of March instant.

Ordered, That unless otherwise ordered by the Senate, for cause shown, the trial of the pending
impeachment shall proceed immediately after replication shall be filed.

MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1868.

THE UNITED STATES vs. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.

The answer of the respondent to the articles of impeachment was submitted by his counsel, as
follows:

Senate of the United States, sitting as a court of impeachment for the trial of Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States.

THE ANSWER OF THE SAID ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT
EXHIBITED AGAINST HIM BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.

And this respondent, further answering, says that by force of the act aforesaid and by reason
of his appointment aforesaid the said Stanton became the principal officer in one of the Executive
Departments of the Government within the true intent and meaning of the second section of the
second article of the Constitution of the United States and according to the true intent and
meaning of that provision of the Constitution of the United States; and, in accordance with
the settled and uniform practice of each and every President of the United States, the said
Stanton then became, and so long as he should continue to hold the said office of Secretary
for the Department of War must continue to be, one of the advisers of the President of the
United States, as well as the person intrusted to act for and represent the President in matters
enjoined upon him or intrusted to him by the President touching the Department aforesaid, and
for whose conduct in such capacity, subordinate to the President, the President is by the Constitution
and laws of the United States made responsible.

And this respondent, further answering, says he succeeded to the office of President of the
United States upon and by reason of the death of Abraham Lincoln, then President of the United
States, on the 15th day of April, 1865, and the said Stanton was then holding the said office
of Secretary for the Department of War under and by reason of the appointment and commission
aforesaid; and not having been removed from the said office by this respondent, the said Stanton
continued to hold the same under the appointment and commission aforesaid, at the pleasure
of the President, until the time hereinafter particularly mentioned, and at no time received
any appointment or commission save as above detailed.

And this respondent, further answering, says that on and prior to the 5th day of August, A.D.
1867, this respondent, the President of the United States, responsible for the conduct of the
Secretary for the Department of War, and having the constitutional right to resort to and rely
upon the person holding that office for advice concerning the great and difficult public duties
enjoined on the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, became satisfied
that he could not allow the said Stanton to continue to hold the office of Secretary for the
Department of War without hazard of the public interest; that the relations between the said
Stanton and the President no longer permitted the President to resort to him for advice or
to be, in the judgment of the President, safely responsible for his conduct of the affairs
of the Department of War, as by law required, in accordance with the orders and instructions
of the President; and thereupon, by force of the Constitution and laws of the United States,
which devolve on the President the power and the duty to control the conduct of the business
of that Executive Department of the Government, and by reason of the constitutional duty of
the President to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, this respondent did necessarily
consider and did determine that the said Stanton ought no longer to hold the said office of
Secretary for the Department of War. And this respondent, by virtue of the power and authority
vested in him as President of the United States by the Constitution and laws of the United
States, to give effect to such his decision and determination, did, on the 5th day of August,
A.D. 1867, address to the said Stanton a note of which the following is a true copy:

  SIR: Public considerations of a high character constrain me to say that
  your resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted.

To which note the said Stanton made the following reply:

  WAR DEPARTMENT,

  Washington, August 5, 1867.

  SIR: Your note of this day has been received, stating that "public
  considerations of a high character constrain" you "to say that" my
  "resignation as Secretary of War will be accepted."

  In reply I have the honor to say that public considerations of a high
  character, which alone have induced me to continue at the head of this
  Department, constrain me not to resign the office of Secretary of War
  before the next meeting of Congress.

  Very respectfully, yours,

  EDWIN M. STANTON.

This respondent, as President of the United States, was thereon of opinion that, having regard
to the necessary official relations and duties of the Secretary for the Department of War to
the President of the United States, according to the Constitution and laws of the United States,
and having regard to the responsibility of the President for the conduct of the said Secretary,
and having regard to the permanent executive authority of the office which the respondent holds
under the Constitution and laws of the United States, it was impossible, consistently with
the public interests, to allow the said Stanton to continue to hold the said office of Secretary
for the Department of War; and it then became the official duty of the respondent, as President
of the United States, to consider and decide what act or acts should and might lawfully be
done by him, as President of the United States, to cause the said Stanton to surrender the
said office.

This respondent was informed and verily believed that it was practically settled by the First
Congress of the United States, and had been so considered and uniformly and in great numbers
of instances acted on by each Congress and President of the United States, in succession, from
President Washington to and including President Lincoln, and from the First Congress to the
Thirty-ninth Congress, that the Constitution of the United States conferred on the President,
as part of the executive power and as one of the necessary means and instruments of performing
the executive duty expressly imposed on him by the Constitution of taking care that the laws
be faithfully executed, the power at any and all times of removing from office all executive
officers for cause to be judged of by the President alone. This respondent had, in pursuance
of the Constitution, required the opinion of each principal officer of the Executive Departments
upon this question of constitutional executive power and duty, and had been advised by each
of them, including the said Stanton, Secretary for the Department of War, that under the Constitution
of the United States this power was lodged by the Constitution in the President of the United
States, and that, consequently, it could be lawfully exercised by him, and the Congress could
not deprive him thereof; and this respondent, in his capacity of President of the United States,
and because in that capacity he was both enabled and bound to use his best judgment upon this
question, did, in good faith and with an earnest desire to arrive at the truth, come to the
conclusion and opinion, and did make the same known to the honorable the Senate of the United
States by a message dated on the 2d day of March, 1867 (a true copy whereof is hereunto annexed
and marked A), that the power last mentioned was conferred and the duty of exercising it in
fit cases was imposed on the President by the Constitution of the United States, and that the
President could not be deprived of this power or relieved of this duty, nor could the same
be vested by law in the President and the Senate jointly, either in part or whole; and this
has ever since remained and was the opinion of this respondent at the time when he was forced
as aforesaid to consider and decide what act or acts should and might lawfully be done by this
respondent, as President of the United States, to cause the said Stanton to surrender the said
office.

This respondent was also then aware that by the first section of "An act regulating the tenure
of certain civil offices," passed March 2, 1867, by a constitutional majority of both Houses
of Congress, it was enacted as follows:

  That every person holding any civil office to which he has been
  appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every
  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office and shall
  become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled to hold
  such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed
  and duly qualified, except as herein otherwise provided: Provided,
  That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, of the Navy,
  and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the Attorney-General
  shall hold their offices, respectively, for and during the term of the
  President by whom they may have been appointed and one month thereafter,
  subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

This respondent was also aware that this act was understood and intended to be an expression
of the opinion of the Congress by which that act was passed that the power to remove executive
officers for cause might by law be taken from the President and vested in him and the Senate
jointly; and although this respondent had arrived at and still retained the opinion above expressed,
and verily believed, as he still believes, that the said first section of the last-mentioned
act was and is wholly inoperative and void by reason of its conflict with the Constitution
of the United States, yet, inasmuch as the same had been enacted by the constitutional majority
in each of the two Houses of that Congress, this respondent considered it to be proper to examine
and decide whether the particular case of the said Stanton, on which it was this respondent's
duty to act, was within or without the terms of that first section of the act, or, if within
it, whether the President had not the power, according to the terms of the act, to remove the
said Stanton from the office of Secretary for the Department of War; and having, in his capacity
of President of the United States, so examined and considered, did form the opinion that the
case of the said Stanton and his tenure of office were not affected by the first section of
the last-named act.

And this respondent, further answering, says that although a case thus existed which, in his
judgment, as President of the United States, called for the exercise of the executive power
to remove the said Stanton from the office of Secretary for the Department of War; and although
this respondent was of opinion, as is above shown, that under the Constitution of the United
States the power to remove the said Stanton from the said office was vested in the President
of the United States; and although this respondent was also of the opinion, as is above shown,
that the case of the said Stanton was not affected by the first section of the last-named act;
and although each of the said opinions had been formed by this respondent upon an actual case,
requiring him, in his capacity of President of the United States, to come to some judgment
and determination thereon, yet this respondent, as President of the United States, desired
and determined to avoid, if possible, any question of the construction and effect of the said
first section of the last-named act, and also the broader question of the executive power conferred
upon the President of the United States by the Constitution of the United States to remove
one of the principal officers of one of the Executive Departments for cause seeming to him
sufficient; and this respondent also desired and determined that if, from causes over which
he could exert no control, it should become absolutely necessary to raise and have in some
way determined either or both of the said last-named questions, it was in accordance with the
Constitution of the United States, and was required of the President thereby, that questions
of so much gravity and importance, upon which the legislative and executive departments of
the Government had disagreed, which involved powers considered by all branches of the Government,
during its entire history down to the year 1867, to have been confided by the Constitution
of the United States to the President, and to be necessary for the complete and proper execution
of his constitutional duties, should be in some proper way submitted to that judicial department
of the Government intrusted by the Constitution with the power, and subjected by it to the
duty, not only of determining finally the construction and effect of all acts of Congress,
but of comparing them with the Constitution of the United States and pronouncing them inoperative
when found in conflict with that fundamental law which the people have enacted for the government
of all their servants. And to these ends, first, that through the action of the Senate of the
United States the absolute duty of the President to substitute some fit person in place of
Mr. Stanton as one of his advisers, and as a principal subordinate officer whose official conduct
he was responsible for and had lawful right to control, might, if possible, be accomplished
without the necessity of raising any one of the questions aforesaid; and, second, if this duty
could not be so performed, then that these questions, or such of them as might necessarily
arise, should be judicially determined in manner aforesaid, and for no other end or purpose,
this respondent, as President of the United States, on the 12th day of August, 1867, seven
days after the reception of the letter of the said Stanton of the 5th of August, hereinbefore
stated, did issue to the said Stanton the order following, namely:

  EXECUTIVE MANSION,

  Washington, August 12, 1867.

  Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

  Secretary of War.

  SIR: By virtue of the power and authority vested in me as President by
  the Constitution and laws of the United States, you are hereby suspended
  from office as Secretary of War, and will cease to exercise any and all
  functions pertaining to the same.

  You will at once transfer to General Ulysses S. Grant, who has this day
  been authorized and empowered to act as Secretary of War ad interim,
  all records, books, papers, and other public property now in your
  custody and charge.

To which said order the said Stanton made the following reply:

  WAR DEPARTMENT,

  Washington City, August 12, 1867.

  The PRESIDENT.

  SIR: Your note of this date has been received, informing me that by
  virtue of the powers vested in you as President by the Constitution
  and laws of the United States I am suspended from office as Secretary
  of War, and will cease to exercise any and all functions pertaining to
  the same; and also directing me at once to transfer to General Ulysses
  S. Grant, who has this day been authorized and empowered to act as
  Secretary of War ad interim, all records, books, papers, and other
  public property now in my custody and charge.

  Under a sense of public duty, I am compelled to deny your right under
  the Constitution and laws of the United States, without the advice and
  consent of the Senate and without legal cause, to suspend me from office
  as Secretary of War, or the exercise of any or all functions pertaining
  to the same, or without such advice and consent to compel me to transfer
  to any person the records, books, papers, and public property in my
  custody as Secretary.

  But inasmuch as the General Commanding the armies of the United States
  has been appointed ad interim, and has notified me that he has
  accepted the appointment, I have no alternative but to submit, under
  protest, to superior force.

And this respondent, further answering, says that it is provided in and by the second section
of "An act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices" that the President may suspend an
officer from the performance of the duties of the office held by him, for certain causes therein
designated, until the next meeting of the Senate and until the case shall be acted on by the
Senate; that this respondent, as President of the United States, was advised, and he verily
believed, and still believes, that the executive power of removal from office confided to him
by the Constitution as aforesaid includes the power of suspension from office at the pleasure
of the President; and this respondent, by the order aforesaid, did suspend the said Stanton
from office, not until the next meeting of the Senate or until the Senate should have acted
upon the case, but, by force of the power and authority vested in him by the Constitution and
laws of the United States, indefinitely and at the pleasure of the President; and the order,
in form aforesaid, was made known to the Senate of the United States on the 12th day of December,
A.D. 1867, as will be more fully hereinafter stated.

And this respondent, further answering, says that in and by the act of February 13, 1795, it
was, among other things, provided and enacted that in case of vacancy in the office of Secretary
for the Department of War it shall be lawful for the President, in case he shall think it necessary,
to authorize any person to perform the duties of that office until a successor be appointed
or such vacancy filled, but not exceeding the term of six months; and this respondent, being
advised and believing that such law was in full force and not repealed, by an order dated August
12, 1867, did authorize and empower Ulysses S. Grant, General of the armies of the United States,
to act as Secretary for the Department of War ad interim, in the form in which similar authority
had theretofore been given, not until the next meeting of the Senate and until the Senate should
act on the case, but at the pleasure of the President, subject only to the limitation of six
months in the said last-mentioned act contained; and a copy of the last-named order was made
known to the Senate of the United States on the 12th day of December, A.D. 1867, as will be
hereinafter more fully stated; and in pursuance of the design and intention aforesaid, if it
should become necessary, to submit the said questions to a judicial determination, this respondent,
at or near the date of the last-mentioned order, did make known such his purpose to obtain
a judicial decision of the said questions, or such of them as might be necessary.

And this respondent, further answering, says that in further pursuance of his intention and
design, if possible, to perform what he judged to be his imperative duty, to prevent the said
Stanton from longer holding the office of Secretary for the Department of War, and at the same
time avoiding, if possible, any question respecting the extent of the power of removal from
executive office confided to the President by the Constitution of the United States, and any
question respecting the construction and effect of the first section of the said "Act regulating
the tenure of certain civil offices," while he should not by any act of his abandon and relinquish
either a power which he believed the Constitution had conferred on the President of the United
States to enable him to perform the duties of his office or a power designedly left to him
by the first section of the act of Congress last aforesaid, this respondent did, on the 12th
day of December, 1867, transmit to the Senate of the United States a message, a copy whereof
is hereunto annexed and marked B, wherein he made known the orders aforesaid and the reasons
which had induced the same, so far as this respondent then considered it material and necessary
that the same should be set forth, and reiterated his views concerning the constitutional power
of removal vested in the President, and also expressed his views concerning the construction
of the said first section of the last-mentioned act, as respected the power of the President
to remove the said Stanton from the said office of Secretary for the Department of War, well
hoping that this respondent could thus perform what he then believed, and still believes, to
be his imperative duty in reference to the said Stanton without derogating from the powers
which this respondent believed were confided to the President by the Constitution and laws,
and without the necessity of raising judicially any questions respecting the same.

And this respondent, further answering, says that this hope not having been realized, the President
was compelled either to allow the said Stanton to resume the said office and remain therein
contrary to the settled convictions of the President, formed as aforesaid, respecting the powers
confided to him and the duties required of him by the Constitution of the United States, and
contrary to the opinion formed as aforesaid that the first section of the last-mentioned act
did not affect the case of the said Stanton, and contrary to the fixed belief of the President
that he could no longer advise with or trust or be responsible for the said Stanton in the
said office of Secretary for the Department of War, or else he was compelled to take such steps
as might in the judgment of the President be lawful and necessary to raise for a judicial decision
the questions affecting the lawful right of the said Stanton to resume the said office or the
power of the said Stanton to persist in refusing to quit the said office if he should persist
in actually refusing to quit the same; and to this end, and to this end only, this respondent
did, on the 21st day of February, 1868, issue the order for the removal of the said Stanton,
in the said first article mentioned and set forth, and the order authorizing the said Lorenzo
Thomas to act as Secretary of War ad interim, in the said second article set forth.

And this respondent, proceeding to answer specifically each substantial allegation in the said
first article, says: He denies that the said Stanton, on the 21st day of February, 1868, was
lawfully in possession of the said office of Secretary for the Department of War. He denies
that the said Stanton, on the day last mentioned, was lawfully entitled to hold the said office
against the will of the President of the United States. He denies that the said order for the
removal of the said Stanton was unlawfully issued. He denies that the said order was issued
with intent to violate the act entitled "An act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices."
He denies that the said order was a violation of the last-mentioned act. He denies that the
said order was a violation of the Constitution of the United States, or of any law thereof,
or of his oath of office. He denies that the said order was issued with an intent to violate
the Constitution of the United States, or any law thereof, or this respondent's oath of office;
and he respectfully but earnestly insists that not only was it issued by him in the performance
of what he believed to be an imperative official duty, but in the performance of what this
honorable court will consider was, in point of fact, an imperative official duty. And he denies
that any and all substantive matters in the said first article contained, in manner and form
as the same are therein stated and set forth, do by law constitute a high misdemeanor in office
within the true intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States.

Answer to Article II.--And for answer to the second article this respondent says that he admits
he did issue and deliver to said Lorenzo Thomas the said writing set forth in said second article,
bearing date at Washington, D.C., February 21, 1868, addressed to Brevet Major-General Lorenzo
Thomas, Adjutant-General United States Army, Washington, D.C., and he further admits that the
same was so issued without the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, then
in session; but he denies that he thereby violated the Constitution of the United States or
any law thereof, or that he did thereby intend to violate the Constitution of the United States
or the provisions of any act of Congress; and this respondent refers to his answer to said
first article for a full statement of the purposes and intentions with which said order was
issued, and adopts the same as part of his answer to this article; and he further denies that
there was then and there no vacancy in the said office of Secretary for the Department of War,
or that he did then and there commit or was guilty of a high misdemeanor in office; and this
respondent maintains and will insist--

1. That at the date and delivery of said writing there was a vacancy existing in the office
of Secretary for the Department of War.

2. That notwithstanding the Senate of the United States was then in session, it was lawful
and according to long and well-established usage to empower and authorize the said Thomas to
act as Secretary of War ad interim.

3. That if the said act regulating the tenure of civil offices be held to be a valid law, no
provision of the same was violated by the issuing of said order or by the designation of said
Thomas to act as Secretary of War ad interim.

Answer to Article III.--And for answer to said third article this respondent says that he abides
by his answer to said first and second articles in so far as the same are responsive to the
allegations contained in the said third article, and, without here again repeating the same
answer, prays the same be taken as an answer to this third article as fully as if here again
set out at length; and as to the new allegation contained in said third article, that this
respondent did appoint the said Thomas to be Secretary for the Department of War ad interim,
this respondent denies that he gave any other authority to said Thomas than such as appears
in said written authority, set out in said article, by which he authorized and empowered said
Thomas to act as Secretary for the Department of War ad interim; and he denies that the same
amounts to an appointment, and insists that it is only a designation of an officer of that
Department to act temporarily as Secretary for the Department of War ad interim--until an appointment
should be made. But whether the said written authority amounts to an appointment or to a temporary
authority or designation, this respondent denies that in any sense he did thereby intend to
violate the Constitution of the United States, or that he thereby intended to give the said
order the character or effect of an appointment in the constitutional or legal sense of that
term. He further denies that there was no vacancy in said office of Secretary for the Department
of War existing at the date of said written authority.

Answer to Article IV.--And for answer to said fourth article this respondent denies that on
the said 21st day of February, 1868, at Washington aforesaid, or at any other time or place,
he did unlawfully conspire with the said Lorenzo Thomas, or with the said Thomas and any other
person or persons, with intent, by intimidations and threats, unlawfully to hinder and prevent
the said Stanton from holding said office of Secretary for the Department of War, in violation
of the Constitution of the United States or of the provisions of the said act of Congress in
said article mentioned, or that he did then and there commit or was guilty of a high crime
in office. On the contrary thereof, protesting that the said Stanton was not then and there
lawfully the Secretary for the Department of War, this respondent states that his sole purpose
in authorizing the said Thomas to act as Secretary for the Department of War ad interim was,
as is fully stated in his answer to the said first article, to bring the question of the right
of the said Stanton to hold said office, notwithstanding his said suspension, and notwithstanding
the said order of removal, and notwithstanding the said authority of the said Thomas to act
as Secretary of War ad interim, to the test of a final decision by the Supreme Court of the
United States in the earliest practicable mode by which the question could be brought before
that tribunal.

This respondent did not conspire or agree with the said Thomas, or any other person or persons,
to use intimidation or threats to hinder or prevent the said Stanton from holding the said
office of Secretary for the Department of War, nor did this respondent at any time command
or advise the said Thomas, or any other person or persons, to resort to or use either threats
or intimidation for that purpose. The only means in the contemplation or purpose of respondent
to be used are set forth fully in the said orders of February 21, the first addressed to Mr.
Stanton and the second to the said Thomas. By the first order the respondent notified Mr. Stanton
that he was removed from the said office and that his functions as Secretary for the Department
of War were to terminate upon the receipt of that order; and he also thereby notified the said
Stanton that the said Thomas had been authorized to act as Secretary for the Department of
War ad interim, and ordered the said Stanton to transfer to him all the records, books, papers,
and other public property in his custody and charge; and by the second order this respondent
notified the said Thomas of the removal from office of the said Stanton, and authorized him
to act as Secretary for the Department of War ad interim, and directed him to immediately enter
upon the discharge of the duties pertaining to that office and to receive the transfer of all
the records, books, papers, and other public property from Mr. Stanton then in his custody
and charge.

Respondent gave no instructions to the said Thomas to use intimidation or threats to enforce
obedience to these orders. He gave him no authority to call in the aid of the military or any
other force to enable him to obtain possession of the office or of the books, papers, records,
or property thereof. The only agency resorted to, or intended to be resorted to, was by means
of the said Executive orders requiring obedience. But the Secretary for the Department of War
refused to obey these orders, and still holds undisturbed possession and custody of that Department
and of the records, books, papers, and other public property therein. Respondent further states
that in execution of the orders so by this respondent given to the said Thomas he, the said
Thomas, proceeded in a peaceful manner to demand of the said Stanton a surrender to him of
the public property in the said Department, and to vacate the possession of the same, and to
allow him, the said Thomas, peaceably to exercise the duties devolved upon him by authority
of the President. That, as this respondent has been informed and believes, the said Stanton
peremptorily refused obedience to the orders so issued. Upon such refusal no force or threat
of force was used by the said Thomas, by authority of the President or otherwise, to enforce
obedience, either then or at any subsequent time.

This respondent doth here except to the sufficiency of the allegations contained in said fourth
article, and states for ground of exception that it is not stated that there was any agreement
between this respondent and the said Thomas, or any other person or persons, to use intimidation
and threats, nor is there any allegation as to the nature of said intimidation and threats,
or that there was any agreement to carry them into execution, or that any step was taken or
agreed to be taken to carry them into execution; and that the allegation in said article that
the intent of said conspiracy was to use intimidation and threats is wholly insufficient, inasmuch
as it is not alleged that the said intent formed the basis or became part of any agreement
between the said alleged conspirators; and, furthermore, that there is no allegation of any
conspiracy or agreement to use intimidation or threats.

Answer to Article V.--And for answer to the said fifth article this respondent denies that
on the said 21st day of February, 1868, or at any other time or times in the same year before
the said 2d day of March, 1868, or at any prior or subsequent time, at Washington aforesaid,
or at any other place, this respondent did unlawfully conspire with the said Thomas, or with
any other person or persons, to prevent or hinder the execution of the said act entitled "An
act regulating the tenure of certain civil offices," or that, in pursuance of said alleged
conspiracy, he did unlawfully attempt to prevent the said Edwin M. Stanton from holding the
said office of Secretary for the Department of War, or that he did thereby commit, or that
he was thereby guilty of, a high misdemeanor in office. Respondent, protesting that said Stanton
was not then and there Secretary for the Department of War, begs leave to refer to his answer
given to the fourth article and to his answer to the first article as to his intent and purpose
in issuing the orders for the removal of Mr. Stanton and the authority given to the said Thomas,
and prays equal benefit therefrom as if the same were here again repeated and fully set forth.

And this respondent excepts to the sufficiency of the said fifth article, and states his ground
for such exception that it is not alleged by what means or by what agreement the said alleged
conspiracy was formed or agreed to be carried out, or in what way the same was attempted to
be carried out, or what were the acts done in pursuance thereof.

Answer to Article VI.--And for answer to the said sixth article this respondent denies that
on the said 21st day of February, 1868, at Washington aforesaid, or at any other time or place,
he did unlawfully conspire with the said Thomas by force to seize, take, or possess the property
of the United States in the Department of War, contrary to the provisions of the said acts
referred to in the said article, or either of them, or with intent to violate either of them.
Respondent, protesting that said Stanton was not then and there Secretary for the Department
of War, not only denies the said conspiracy as charged, but also denies any unlawful intent
in reference to the custody and charge of the property of the United States in the said Department
of War, and again refers to his former answers for a full statement of his intent and purpose
in the premises.

Answer to Article VII.--And for answer to the said seventh article respondent denies that on
the said 21st day of February, 1868, at Washington aforesaid, or at any other time and place,
he did unlawfully conspire with the said Thomas with intent unlawfully to seize, take, or possess
the property of the United States in the Department of War, with intent to violate or disregard
the said act in the said seventh article referred to, or that he did then and there commit
a high misdemeanor in office. Respondent, protesting that the said Stanton was not then and
there Secretary for the Department of War, again refers to his former answers, in so far as
they are applicable, to show the intent with which he proceeded in the premises, and prays
equal benefit therefrom as if the same were here again fully repeated. Respondent further takes
exception to the sufficiency of the allegations of this article as to the conspiracy alleged
upon the same grounds as stated in the exception set forth in his answer to said article fourth.

Answer to Article VIII.--And for answer to the said eighth article this respondent denies that,
on the 21st day of February, 1868, at Washington aforesaid, or at any other time and place,
he did issue and deliver to the said Thomas the said letter of authority set forth in the said
eighth article with the intent unlawfully to control the disbursements of the money appropriated
for the military service and for the Department of War. This respondent, protesting that there
was a vacancy in the office of Secretary of War, admits that he did issue the said letter of
authority, and he denies that the same was with any unlawful intent whatever, either to violate
the Constitution of the United States or any act of Congress. On the contrary, this respondent
again affirms that his sole intent was to vindicate his authority as President of the United
States, and by peaceful means to bring the question of the right of the said Stanton to continue
to hold the said office of Secretary of War to a final decision before the Supreme Court of
the United States, as has been hereinbefore set forth; and he prays the same benefit from his
answer in the premises as if the same were here again repeated at length.

Answer to Article IX.--And for answer to the said ninth article the respondent states that
on the said 22d day of February, 1868, the following note was addressed to the said Emory by
the private secretary of the respondent:

  EXECUTIVE MANSION,

  WASHINGTON, D.C.,

  February 22, 1868.

  GENERAL: The President directs me to say that he will be pleased to have
  you call upon him as early as practicable.

  Respectfully and truly yours,

  WILLIAM G. MOORE,

  United States Army.

General Emory called at the Executive Mansion according to this request. The object of respondent
was to be advised by General Emory, as commander of the Department of Washington, what changes
had been made in the military affairs of the department. Respondent had been informed that
various changes had been made which in no wise had been brought to his notice or reported to
him from the Department of War or from any other quarter, and desired to ascertain the facts.
After the said Emory had explained in detail the changes which had taken place, said Emory
called the attention of respondent to a general order which he referred to, and which this
respondent then sent for, when it was produced. It is as follows:

  GENERAL ORDERS, No, 17.

  WAR DEPARTMENT,

  ADJUTANT-GENERALS OFFICE,

  Washington, March 14, 1867.

  The following acts of Congress are published for the information and
  government of all concerned:

  *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  "II.--PUBLIC--No. 85.

  *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  "SEC. 2. The General of the Army shall not be removed,
  suspended, or relieved from command, or assigned to duty elsewhere than
  at said headquarters, except at his own request, without the previous
  approval of the Senate; and any orders or instructions relating to
  military operations issued contrary to the requirements of this section
  shall be null and void; and any officer who shall issue orders or
  instructions contrary to the provisions of this section shall be deemed
  guilty of a misdemeanor in office; and any officer of the Army who shall
  transmit, convey, or obey any orders or instructions so issued contrary
  to the provisions of this section, knowing that such orders were so
  issued, shall be liable to imprisonment for not less than two nor more
  than twenty years upon conviction thereof in any court of competent
  jurisdiction.

  *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  "Approved, March 2, 1867."

  *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  By order of the Secretary of War:

  E.D. TOWNSEND,

  Assistant Adjutant-General.

  Official:

  -------- --------,

  Assistant Adjutant-General.

General Emory not only called the attention of respondent to this order, but to the fact that
it was in conformity with a section contained in an appropriation act passed by Congress. Respondent,
after reading the order, observed:

This is not in accordance with the Constitution of the United States, which makes me Commander
in Chief of the Army and Navy, or of the language of the commission which you hold.

General Emory then stated that this order had met the respondent's approval. Respondent then
said in reply, in substance:

  Am I to understand that the President of the United States can not give
  an order but through the General in Chief, or General Grant?

General Emory again reiterated the statement that it had met respondent's approval, and that
it was the opinion of some of the leading lawyers of the country that this order was constitutional.
With some further conversation, respondent then inquired the names of the lawyers who had given
the opinion, and he mentioned the names of two. Respondent then said that the object of the
law was very evident, referring to the clause in the appropriation act upon which the order
purported to be based. This, according to respondent's recollection, was the substance of the
conversation had with General Emory.

Respondent denies that any allegations in the said article of any instructions or declarations
given to the said Emory then or at any other time contrary to or in addition to what is hereinbefore
set forth are true. Respondent denies that in said conversation with said Emory he had any
other intent than to express the opinion then given to the said Emory, nor did he then or at
any time request or order the said Emory to disobey any law or any order issued in conformity
with any law, or intend to offer any inducement to the said Emory to violate any law. What
this respondent then said to General Emory was simply the expression of an opinion which he
then fully believed to be sound, and which he yet believes to be so, and that is that by the
express provisions of the Constitution this respondent, as President, is made the Commander
in Chief of the armies of the United States, and as such he is to be respected, and that his
orders, whether issued through the War Department, or through the General in Chief, or by any
other channel of communication, are entitled to respect and obedience, and that such constitutional
power can not be taken from him by virtue of any act of Congress. Respondent doth therefore
deny that by the expression of such opinion he did commit or was guilty of a high misdemeanor
in office; and the respondent doth further say that the said Article IX lays no foundation
whatever for the conclusion stated in the said article, that the respondent, by reason of the
allegations therein contained, was guilty of a high misdemeanor in office.

In reference to the statement made by General Emory that this respondent had approved of said
act of Congress containing the section referred to, the respondent admits that his formal approval
was given to said act, but accompanied the same by the following message, addressed and sent
with the act to the House of Representatives, in which House the said act originated, and from
which it came to respondent:

  WASHINGTON, D.C., March 2, 1867. These provisions
  are contained in the second section, which in certain cases virtually
  deprives the President of his constitutional functions as Commander in
  Chief of the Army, and in the sixth section, which denies to ten States
  of the Union their constitutional right to protect themselves in any
  emergency by means of their own militia. These provisions are out of
  place in an appropriation act, but I am compelled to defeat these
  necessary appropriations if I withhold my signature from the act.
  Pressed by these considerations, I feel constrained to return the bill
  with my signature, but to accompany it with my earnest protest against
  the sections which I have indicated.

Respondent, therefore, did no more than to express to said Emory the same opinion which he
had so expressed to the House of Representatives.

Answer to Article X.--And in answer to the tenth article and specifications thereof the respondent
says that on the 14th and 15th days of August, in the year 1866, a political convention of
delegates from all or most of the States and Territories of the Union was held in the city
of Philadelphia, under the name and style of the National Union Convention, for the purpose
of maintaining and advancing certain political views and opinions before the people of the
United States, and for their support and adoption in the exercise of the constitutional suffrage
in the elections of Representatives and Delegates in Congress which were soon to occur in many
of the States and Territories of the Union; which said convention, in the course of its proceedings,
and in furtherance of the objects of the same, adopted a "Declaration of principles" and "An
address to the people of the United States," and appointed a committee of two of its members
from each State and of one from each Territory and one from the District of Columbia to wait
upon the President of the United States and present to him a copy of the proceedings of the
convention; that on the 18th day of said month of August this committee waited upon the President
of the United States at the Executive Mansion, and was received by him in one of the rooms
thereof, and by their chairman, Hon. Reverdy Johnson, then and now a Senator of the United
States, acting and speaking in their behalf, presented a copy of the proceedings of the convention
and addressed the President of the United States in a speech of which a copy (according to
a published report of the same, and, as the respondent believes, substantially a correct report)
is hereto annexed as a part of this answer, and marked Exhibit C.

That thereupon, and in reply to the address of said committee by their chairman, this respondent
addressed the said committee so waiting upon him in one of the rooms of the Executive Mansion;
and this respondent believes that this his address to said committee is the occasion referred
to in the first specification of the tenth article; but this respondent does not admit that
the passages therein set forth, as if extracts from a speech or address of this respondent
upon said occasion, correctly or justly present his speech or address upon said occasion, but,
on the contrary, this respondent demands and insists that if this honorable court shall deem
the said article and the said first specification thereof to contain allegation of matter cognizable
by this honorable court as a high misdemeanor in office within the intent and meaning of the
Constitution of the United States, and shall receive or allow proof in support of the same,
that proof shall be required to be made of the actual speech and address of this respondent
on said occasion, which this respondent denies that said article and specification contain
or correctly or justly represent.

And this respondent, further answering the tenth article and the specifications thereof, says
that at Cleveland, in the State of Ohio, and on the 3d day of September, in the year 1866,
he was attended by a large assemblage of his fellow-citizens, and in deference and obedience
to their call and demand he addressed them upon matters of public and political consideration;
and this respondent believes that said occasion and address are referred to in the second specification
of the tenth article; but this respondent does not admit that the passages therein set forth,
as if extracts from a speech of this respondent on said occasion, correctly or justly present
his speech or address upon said occasion, but, on the contrary, this respondent demands and
insists that if this honorable court shall deem the said article and the said second specification
thereof to contain allegation of matter cognizable by this honorable court as a high misdemeanor
in office within the intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and shall
receive or allow proof in support of the same, that proof shall be required to be made of the
actual speech and address of this respondent on said occasion, which this respondent denies
that said article and specification contain or correctly or justly represent.

And this respondent, further answering the tenth article and the specifications thereof, says
that at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, and on the 8th day of September, in the year 1866,
he was attended by a numerous assemblage of his fellow-citizens, and in deference and obedience
to their call and demand he addressed them upon matters of public and political consideration;
and this respondent believes that said occasion and address are referred to in the third specification
of the tenth article; but this respondent does not admit that the passages therein set forth,
as if extracts from a speech of this respondent on said occasion, correctly or justly present
his speech or address upon said occasion, but, on the contrary, this respondent demands and
insists that if this honorable court shall deem the said article and the said third specification
thereof to contain allegation of matter cognizable by this honorable court as a high misdemeanor
in office within the intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and shall
receive or allow proof in support of the same, that proof shall be required to be made of the
actual speech and address of this respondent on said occasion, which this respondent denies
that the said article and specification contain or correctly or justly represent.

And this respondent, further answering the tenth article, protesting that he has not been unmindful
of the high duties of his office or of the harmony or courtesies which ought to exist and be
maintained between the executive and legislative branches of the Government of the United States,
denies that he has ever intended or designed to set aside the rightful authority or powers
of Congress, or attempted to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, or reproach the
Congress of the United States, or either branch thereof, or to impair or destroy the regard
or respect of all or any of the good people of the United States for the Congress or the rightful
legislative power thereof, or to excite the odium or resentment of all or any of the good people
of the United States against Congress and the laws by it duly and constitutionally enacted.
This respondent further says that at all times he has, in his official acts as President, recognized
the authority of the several Congresses of the United States as constituted and organized during
his administration of the office of President of the United States.

And this respondent, further answering, says that he has from time to time, under his constitutional
right and duty as President of the United States, communicated to Congress his views and opinions
in regard to such acts or resolutions thereof as, being submitted to him as President of the
United States in pursuance of the Constitution, seemed to this respondent to require such communications;
and he has from time to time, in the exercise of that freedom of speech which belongs to him
as a citizen of the United States, and, in his political relations as President of the United
States to the people of the United States, is upon fit occasions a duty of the highest obligation,
expressed to his fellow-citizens his views and opinions respecting the measures and proceedings
of Congress; and that in such addresses to his fellow-citizens and in such his communications
to Congress he has expressed his views, opinions, and judgment of and concerning the actual
constitution of the two Houses of Congress, without representation therein of certain States
of the Union, and of the effect that in wisdom and justice, in the opinion and judgment of
this respondent, Congress in its legislation and proceedings should give to this political
circumstance; and whatsoever he has thus communicated to Congress or addressed to his fellow-citizens
or any assemblage thereof this respondent says was and is within and according to his right
and privilege as an American citizen and his right and duty as President of the United States.

And this respondent, not waiving or at all disparaging his right of freedom of opinion and
of freedom of speech, as hereinbefore or hereinafter more particularly set forth, but claiming
and insisting upon the same, further answering the said tenth article, says that the views
and opinions expressed by this respondent in his said addresses to the assemblages of his fellow-citizens,
as in said articles or in this answer thereto mentioned, are not and were not intended to be
other or different from those expressed by him in his communications to Congress--that the
eleven States lately in insurrection never had ceased to be States of the Union, and that they
were then entitled to representation in Congress by loyal Representatives and Senators as fully
as the other States of the Union, and that consequently the Congress as then constituted was
not in fact a Congress of all the States, but a Congress of only a part of the States. This
respondent, always protesting against the unauthorized exclusion therefrom of the said eleven
States, nevertheless gave his assent to all laws passed by said Congress which did not, in
his opinion and judgment, violate the Constitution, exercising his constitutional authority
of returning bills to said Congress with his objections when they appeared to him to be unconstitutional
or inexpedient.

And further, this respondent has also expressed the opinion, both in his communications to
Congress and in his addresses to the people, that the policy adopted by Congress in reference
to the States lately in insurrection did not tend to peace, harmony, and union, but, on the
contrary, did tend to disunion and the permanent disruption of the States, and that in following
its said policy laws had been passed by Congress in violation of the fundamental principles
of the Government, and which tended to consolidation and despotism; and such being his deliberate
opinions, he would have felt himself unmindful of the high duties of his office if he had failed
to express them in his communications to Congress or in his addresses to the people when called
upon by them to express his opinions on matters of public and political consideration.

And this respondent, further answering the tenth article, says that he has always claimed and
insisted, and now claims and insists, that both in the personal and private capacity of a citizen
of the United States and in the political relations of the President of the United States to
the people of the United States, whose servant, under the duties and responsibilities of the
Constitution of the United States, the President of the United States is and should always
remain, this respondent had and has the full right, and in his office of President of the United
States is held to the high duty, of forming, and on fit occasions expressing, opinions of and
concerning the legislation of Congress, proposed or completed, in respect of its wisdom, expediency,
justice, worthiness, objects, purposes, and public and political motives and tendencies, and
within and as a part of such right and duty to form, and on fit occasions to express, opinions
of and concerning the public character and conduct, views, purposes, objects, motives, and
tendencies of all men engaged in the public service, as well in Congress as otherwise, and
under no other rules or limits upon this right of freedom of opinion and of freedom of speech,
or of responsibility and amenability for the actual exercise of such freedom of opinion and
freedom of speech, than attend upon such rights and their exercise on the part of all other
citizens of the United States and on the part of all their public servants.

And this respondent, further answering said tenth article, says that the several occasions
on which, as is alleged in the several specifications of said article, this respondent addressed
his fellow-citizens on subjects of public and political considerations were not, nor was any
one of them, sought or planned by this respondent, but, on the contrary, each of said occasions
arose upon the exercise of a lawful and accustomed right of the people of the United States
to call upon their public servants and express to them their opinions, wishes, and feelings
upon matters of public and political consideration, and to invite from such their public servants
an expression of their opinions, views, and feelings on matters of public and political consideration;
and this respondent claims and insists before this honorable court, and before all the people
of the United States, that of or concerning this his right of freedom of opinion and of freedom
of speech, and this his exercise of such rights on all matters of public and political consideration,
and in respect of all public servants or persons whatsoever engaged in or connected therewith,
this respondent, as a citizen or as President of the United States, is not subject to question,
inquisition, impeachment, or inculpation in any form or manner whatsoever.

And this respondent says that neither the said tenth article nor any specification thereof
nor any allegation therein contained touches or relates to any official act or doing of this
respondent in the office of President of the United States or in the discharge of any of its
constitutional or legal duties or responsibilities; but said article and the specifications
and allegations thereof, wholly and in every part thereof, question only the discretion or
propriety of freedom of opinion or freedom, of speech as exercised by this respondent as a
citizen of the United States in his personal right and capacity, and without allegation or
imputation against this respondent of the violation of any law of the United States touching
or relating to freedom of speech or its exercise by the citizens of the United States or by
this respondent as one of the said citizens or otherwise; and he denies that by reason of any
matter in said article or its specifications alleged he has said or done anything indecent
or unbecoming in the Chief Magistrate of the United States, or that he has brought the high
office of President of the United States into contempt, ridicule, or disgrace, or that he has
committed or has been guilty of a high misdemeanor in office.

Answer to Article XI.--And in answer to the eleventh article this respondent denies that on
the 18th day of August, in the year 1866, at the city of Washington, in the District of Columbia,
he did, by public speech or otherwise, declare or affirm, in substance or at all, that the
Thirty-ninth Congress of the United States was not a Congress of the United States authorized
by the Constitution to exercise legislative power under the same, or that he did then and there
declare or affirm that the said Thirty-ninth Congress was a Congress of only part of the States
in any sense or meaning other than that ten States of the Union were denied representation
therein, or that he made any or either of the declarations or affirmations in this behalf in
the said article alleged as denying or intending to deny that the legislation of said Thirty-ninth
Congress was valid or obligatory upon this respondent except so far as this respondent saw
fit to approve the same; and as to the allegation in said article that he did thereby intend
or mean to be understood that the said Congress had not power to propose amendments to the
Constitution, this respondent says that in said address he said nothing in reference to the
subject of amendments of the Constitution, nor was the question of the competency of the said
Congress to propose such amendments, without the participation of said excluded States, at
the time of said address in any way mentioned or considered or referred to by this respondent,
nor in what he did say had he any intent regarding the same; and he denies the allegations
so made to the contrary thereof. But this respondent, in further answer to and in respect of
the said allegations of the said eleventh article hereinbefore traversed and denied, claims
and insists upon his personal and official right of freedom of opinion and freedom of speech,
and his duty in his political relations as President of the United States to the people of
the United States in the exercise of such freedom of opinion and freedom of speech, in the
same manner, form, and effect as he has in this behalf stated the same in his answer to the
said tenth article, and with the same effect as if he here repeated the same; and he further
claims and insists, as in said answer to said tenth article he has claimed and insisted, that
he is not subject to question, inquisition, impeachment or inculpation, in any form or manner,
of or concerning such rights of freedom of opinion or freedom of speech, or his said alleged
exercise thereof.

And this respondent, further answering the said eleventh article, says that he has in his answer
to the first article set forth in detail the acts, steps, and proceedings done and taken by
this respondent to and toward or in the matter of the suspension or removal of the said Edwin
M. Stanton in or from the office of Secretary for the Department of War, with the times, modes,
circumstances, intents, views, purposes, and opinions of official obligations and duty under
and with which such acts, steps, and proceedings were done and taken; and he makes answer to
this eleventh article of the matters in his answer to the first article pertaining to the suspension
or removal of said Edwin M. Stanton, to the same intent and effect as if they were here repeated
and set forth.

And this respondent, further answering the said eleventh article, denies that by means or reason
of anything in said article alleged this respondent, as President of the United States, did,
on the 21st day of February, 1868, or at any other day or time, commit or that he was guilty
of a high misdemeanor in office.

And this respondent, further answering the said eleventh article, says that the same and the
matters therein contained do not charge or allege the commission of any act whatever by this
respondent in his office of President of the United States, nor the omission by this respondent
of any act of official obligation or duty in his office of President of the United States;
nor does the said article nor the matters therein contained name, designate, describe, or define
any act or mode or form of attempt, device, contrivance, or means, or of attempt at device,
contrivance, or means, whereby this respondent can know or understand what act or mode or form
of attempt, device, contrivance, or means, or of attempt at device, contrivance, or means,
are imputed to or charged against this respondent in his office of President of the United
States, or intended so to be, or whereby this respondent can more fully or definitely make
answer unto the said article than he hereby does.

And this respondent, in submitting to this honorable court this his answer to the articles
of impeachment exhibited against him, respectfully reserves leave to amend and add to the same
from time to time, as may become necessary or proper, and when and as such necessity and propriety
shall appear.

EXHIBIT C.

ADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT BY HON. REVERDY JOHNSON, AUGUST, 18, 1866.

Mr. PRESIDENT: We are before you as a committee of the National Union Convention, which met
in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the 14th instant, charged with the duty of presenting you with
an authentic copy of its proceedings.

Before placing it in your hands you will permit us to congratulate you that in the object for
which the convention was called, in the enthusiasm with which in every State and Territory
the call was responded to, in the unbroken harmony of its deliberations, in the unanimity with
which the principles it has declared were adopted, and more especially in the patriotic and
constitutional character of the principles themselves, we are confident that you and the country
will find gratifying and cheering evidence that there exists among the people a public sentiment
which renders an early and complete restoration of the Union as established by the Constitution
certain and inevitable. Party faction, seeking the continuance of its misrule, may momentarily
delay it, but the principles of political liberty for which our fathers successfully contended,
and to secure which they adopted the Constitution, are so glaringly inconsistent with the condition
in which the country has been placed by such misrule that it will not be permitted a much longer
duration.

We wish, Mr. President, you could have witnessed the spirit of concord and brotherly affection
which animated every member of the convention. Great as your confidence has ever been in the
intelligence and patriotism of your fellow-citizens, in their deep devotion to the Union and
their present determination to reinstate and maintain it, that confidence would have become
a positive conviction could you have seen and heard all that was done and said upon the occasion.
Every heart was evidently full of joy; every eye beamed with patriotic animation; despondency
gave place to the assurance that, our late dreadful civil strife ended, the blissful reign
of peace, under the protection, not of arms, but of the Constitution and laws, would have sway,
and be in every part of our land cheerfully acknowledged and in perfect good faith obeyed.
You would not have doubted that the recurrence of dangerous domestic insurrections in the future
is not to be apprehended.

If you could have seen the men of Massachusetts and South Carolina coming into the convention
on the first day of its meeting hand in hand, amid the rapturous applause of the whole body,
awakened by heartfelt gratification at the event, filling the eyes of thousands with tears
of joy, which they neither could nor desired to repress, you would have felt, as every person
present felt, that the time had arrived when all sectional or other perilous dissensions had
ceased, and that nothing should be heard in the future but the voice of harmony proclaiming
devotion to a common country, of pride in being bound together by a common Union, existing
and protected by forms of government proved by experience to be eminently fitted for the exigencies
of either war or peace.

In the principles announced by the convention and in the feeling there manifested we have every
assurance that harmony throughout our entire land will soon prevail. We know that as in former
days, as was eloquently declared by Webster, the nation's most gifted statesman, Massachusetts
and South Carolina went "shoulder to shoulder through the Revolution" and stood hand in hand
"around the Administration of Washington and felt his own great arm lean on them for support,"
so will they again, with like magnanimity, devotion, and power, stand round your Administration
and cause you to feel that you may also lean on them for support.

In the proceedings, Mr. President, which we are to place in your hands you will find that the
convention performed the grateful duty imposed upon them by their knowledge of your "devotion
to the Constitution and laws and interests of your country," as illustrated by your entire
Presidential career, of declaring that in you they "recognize a Chief Magistrate worthy of
the nation and equal to the great crisis upon which your lot is cast;" and in this declaration
it gives us marked pleasure to add we are confident that the convention has but spoken the
intelligent and patriotic sentiment of the country. Ever inaccessible to the low influences
which often control the mere partisan, governed alone by an honest opinion of constitutional
obligations and rights and of the duty of looking solely to the true interests, safety, and
honor of the nation, such a class is incapable of resorting to any bait for popularity at the
expense of the public good.

In the measures which you have adopted for the restoration of the Union the convention saw
only a continuance of the policy which for the same purpose was inaugurated by your immediate
predecessor. In his reelection by the people, after that policy had been fully indicated and
had been made one of the issues of the contest, those of his political friends who are now
assailing you for sternly pursuing it are forgetful or regardless of the opinions which their
support of his reelection necessarily involved. Being upon the same ticket with that much-lamented
public servant, whose foul assassination touched the heart of the civilized world with grief
and horror, you would have been false to obvious duty if you had not endeavored to carry out
the same policy; and, judging now by the opposite one which Congress has pursued, its wisdom
and patriotism are indicated by the fact that that of Congress has but continued a broken Union
by keeping ten of the States in which at one time the insurrection existed (as far as they
could accomplish it) in the condition of subjugated provinces, denying to them the right to
be represented, while subjecting their people to every species of legislation, including that
of taxation. That such a state of things is at war with the very genius of our Government,
inconsistent with every idea of political freedom, and most perilous to the peace and safety
of the country no reflecting man can fail to believe.

We hope, sir, that the proceedings of the convention will cause you to adhere, if possible,
with even greater firmness to the course which you are pursuing, by satisfying you that the
people are with you, and that the wish which lies nearest to their heart is that a perfect
restoration of our Union at the earliest moment be attained, and a conviction that the result
can only be accomplished by the measures which you are pursuing. And in the discharge of the
duties which these impose upon you we, as did every member of the convention, again for ourselves
individually tender to you our profound respect and assurance of our cordial and sincere support.

With a reunited Union, with no foot but that of a freeman treading or permitted to tread our
soil, with a nation's faith pledged forever to a strict observance of all its obligations,
with kindness and fraternal love everywhere prevailing, the desolations of war will soon be
removed; its sacrifices of life, sad as they have been, will, with Christian resignation, be
referred to a providential purpose of fixing our beloved country on a firm and enduring basis,
which will forever place our liberty and happiness beyond the reach of human peril.

Then, too, and forever, will our Government challenge the admiration and receive the respect
of the nations of the world, and be in no danger of any efforts to impeach our honor.

And permit me, sir, in conclusion, to add that, great as is your solicitude for the restoration
of our domestic peace and your labors to that end, you have also a watchful eye to the rights
of the nation, and that any attempt by an assumed or actual foreign power to enforce an illegal
blockade against the Government or citizens of the United States, to use your own mild but
expressive words, "will be disallowed." In this determination I am sure you will receive the
unanimous approval of your fellow-citizens.

Now, sir, as the chairman of this committee, and in behalf of the convention, I have the honor
to present you with an authentic copy of its proceedings.

  Counsel for the respondent submitted the following motion:

  To the Senate of the United States sitting as a court of impeachment:

  And now, on this 23d day of March, in the year 1868, the counsel for
  the President of the United States, upon reading and filing his answer
  to the articles of impeachment exhibited against him, respectfully
  represent to the honorable court that after the replication shall have
  been filed to the said answer the due and proper preparation of and for
  the trial of the cause will require, in the opinion and judgment of such
  counsel, that a period of not less than thirty days should be allowed to
  the President of the United States and his counsel for such preparation,
  and before the said trial should proceed.

TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1868.

UNITED STATES vs. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.

REPLICATION BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE ANSWER OF ANDREW JOHNSON,
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED AGAINST HIM BY THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

The House of Representatives of the United States have considered the several answers of Andrew
Johnson, President of the United States, to the several articles of impeachment against him,
by them exhibited in the name of themselves and of all the people of the United States, and
reserving to themselves all advantage of exception to the insufficiency of his answer to each
and all of the several articles of impeachment exhibited against said Andrew Johnson, President
of the United States, do deny each and every averment in said several answers, or either of
them, which denies or traverses the acts, intents, crimes, or misdemeanors charged against
said Andrew Johnson in the said articles of impeachment, or either of them, and for replication
to the said answer do say that said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, is guilty
of the high crimes and misdemeanors mentioned in said articles, and that the House of Representatives
are ready to prove the same.

SCHUYLER COLFAX,

Speaker of the House of Representatives.

EDW'D McPHERSON,

Clerk of the House of Representatives.

The motion of the counsel for the respondent, submitted on March 23, "that a period of not
less than thirty days should be allowed to the President of the United States and his counsel
for such preparation and before the said trial should proceed," was denied, and it was

  Ordered. That the Senate will commence the trial of the President
  upon the articles of impeachment exhibited against him on Monday, the
  30th of March instant, and proceed therein with all convenient dispatch
  under the rules of the Senate sitting upon the trial of an impeachment.

MONDAY, MAY 11, 1868.

THE UNITED STATES vs. ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT.

The Chief Justice stated that in compliance with the desire of the Senate he had prepared the
question to be addressed to Senators upon each article of impeachment, and that he had reduced
his views thereon to writing, which he read, as follows:

SENATORS: In conformity with what seemed to be the general wish of the Senate when it adjourned
last Thursday, the Chief Justice, in taking the vote on the articles of impeachment, will adopt
the mode sanctioned by the practice in the cases of Chase, Peck, and Humphreys.

He will direct the Secretary to read the several articles successively, and after the reading
of each article will put the question of guilty or not guilty to each Senator, rising in his
place, in the form used in the case of Judge Chase:

  Mr. Senator ----, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson,
  President of the United States, guilty or not guilty of a high
  misdemeanor, as charged in this article?

In putting the question on Articles IV and VI, each of which charges a crime, the word "crime"
will be substituted for the word "misdemeanor."

The Chief Justice has carefully considered the suggestion of the Senator from Indiana (Mr.
Hendricks), which appeared to meet the approval of the Senate, that in taking the vote on the
eleventh article the question should be put on each clause, and has found himself unable to
divide the article as suggested. The article charges several facts, but they are so connected
that they make but one allegation and they are charged as constituting one misdemeanor.

The first fact charged is, in substance, that the President publicly declared in August, 1866,
that the Thirty-ninth Congress was a Congress of only part of the States and not a constitutional
Congress, intending thereby to deny its constitutional competency to enact laws or propose
amendments of the Constitution; and this charge seems to have been made as introductory, and
as qualifying that which follows, namely, that the President, in pursuance of this declaration,
attempted to prevent the execution of the tenure-of-office act by contriving and attempting
to contrive means to prevent Mr. Stanton from resuming the functions of Secretary of War after
the refusal of the Senate to concur in his suspension, and also by contriving and attempting
to contrive means to prevent the execution of the appropriation act of March 2, 1867, and also
to prevent the execution of the rebel States governments act of the same date.

The gravamen of the article seems to be that the President attempted to defeat the execution
of the tenure-of-office act, and that he did this in pursuance of a declaration which was intended
to deny the constitutional competency of Congress to enact laws or propose constitutional amendments,
and by contriving means to prevent Mr. Stanton from resuming his office of Secretary, and also
to prevent the execution of the appropriation act and the rebel States governments act.

The single substantive matter charged is the attempt to prevent the execution of the tenure-of-office
act, and the other facts are alleged either as introductory and exhibiting this general purpose
or as showing the means contrived in furtherance of that attempt.

This single matter, connected with the other matters previously and subsequently alleged, is
charged as the high misdemeanor of which the President is alleged to have been guilty.

The general question, guilty or not guilty of a high misdemeanor as charged, seems fully to
cover the whole charge, and will be put as to this article as well as to the others, unless
the Senate direct some mode of division.

In the tenth article the division suggested by the Senator from New York (Mr. Conkling) may
be more easily made. It contains a general allegation to the effect that on the 18th of August
and on other days the President, with intent to set aside the rightful authority of Congress
and bring it into contempt, delivered certain scandalous harangues, and therein uttered loud
threats and bitter menaces against Congress and the laws of the United States enacted by Congress,
thereby bringing the office of President into disgrace, to the great scandal of all good citizens,
and sets forth in three distinct specifications the harangues, threats, and menaces complained of.

In respect to this article, if the Senate sees fit so to direct, the question of guilty or
not guilty of the facts charged may be taken in respect to the several specifications, and
then the question of guilty or not guilty of a high misdemeanor, as charged in the article,
can also be taken.

The Chief Justice, however, sees no objection to putting the general question on this article
in the same manner as on the others; for, whether particular questions be put on the specifications
or not, the answer to the final question must be determined by the judgment of the Senate whether
or not the facts alleged in the specifications have been sufficiently proved, and whether,
if sufficiently proved, they amount to a high misdemeanor within the meaning of the Constitution.

On the whole, therefore, the Chief Justice thinks that the better practice will be to put the
general question on each article without attempting to make any subdivision, and will pursue
this course if no objection is made. He will, however, be pleased to conform to such directions
as the Senate may see fit to give in this respect.

Whereupon it was

  Ordered, That the question be put as proposed by the Presiding
  Officer of the Senate, and each Senator shall rise in his place and
  answer "guilty" or "not guilty" only.

ADDENDA.

[An injunction of secrecy having been placed upon the following messages by the Senate, they
were not printed in the Executive Journal covering their period, but were found in the imprinted
Executive Journal of the Forty-first Congress while searching for copy for Volume VII, and
consequently too late for insertion in their proper places in this volume.]

WASHINGTON, January 29, 1869.

To the Senate:

Referring to the three Executive communications of the 15th instant, with which were transmitted
to the Senate, respectively, a copy of a convention between the United States and Great Britain
upon the subject of claims, a copy of a convention between the same parties in relation to
the question of boundary, and a protocol of a treaty between the same parties concerning the
rights of naturalized citizens and subjects of the respective parties, I now transmit a copy
of such correspondence upon those subjects as has not been heretofore communicated to the Senate.

In the progress of the negotiation the three subjects became to such a degree associated with
each other that it would be difficult to present separately the correspondence upon each. The
papers are therefore transmitted in the order in which they are mentioned in the accompanying list.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 30, 1869.

To the Senate of the United States:

Referring to the Executive communication of the 15th instant, which was accompanied by a copy
of a convention between the United States and Great Britain for the settlement of all outstanding
claims, I now transmit to the Senate the original of that instrument, and a report of the Secretary
of State pointing out the differences between the copy as submitted to the Senate and the original
as signed by the plenipotentiaries.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

WASHINGTON, January 30, 1869.

To the Senate of the United States:

Referring to the Executive communication of the 15th instant, which was accompanied by a copy
of a convention between the United States and Great Britain providing for the reference to
an arbiter of the question of difference between the United States and Great Britain concerning
the northwest line of water boundary between the United States and the British possessions
in North America, I now transmit to the Senate the original of that instrument, and a report
of the Secretary of State pointing out the differences between the copy as submitted to the
Senate and the original as signed by the plenipotentiaries.

ANDREW JOHNSON.
