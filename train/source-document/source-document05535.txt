Finally, perceiving that the devotion of the people of Siena was all turned to the talents
and excellent works of Domenico Beccafumi, and possessing neither house nor revenues in Siena,
and having by that time consumed almost all his property and become old and poor, Giovanni
Antonio departed from Siena almost in despair and went off to Volterra. And there, as his good
fortune would have it, chancing upon Messer Lorenzo di Galeotto de' Medici, a rich and honoured
nobleman, he proceeded to live under his protection, with the intention of staying there a
long time. And so, dwelling in the house of that nobleman, he painted for him on a canvas the
Chariot of the Sun, which, having been badly guided by Phaëthon, is falling into the Po; but
it is easy to see that he did that work to pass the time, and hurried through it by rule of
thumb, without giving any thought to it, so entirely commonplace is it and so ill-considered.
Then, having grown weary of living at Volterra and in the house of that nobleman, as one who
was accustomed to being free, he departed and went off to Pisa, where, at the instance of Battista
del Cervelliera, he executed two pictures for Messer Bastiano della Seta, the Warden of Works
of the Duomo, which were placed in the recess behind the high-altar of that Duomo, beside those
of Sogliani and Beccafumi. In one is the Dead Christ with Our Lady and the other Maries, and
in the other Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac; but since these pictures did not succeed very
well, the Warden, who had intended to make him paint some altar-pieces for the church, dismissed
him, knowing that men who do not study, once they have lost in old age the quality of excellence
that they had in their youth from nature, are left with a kind of facility of manner that is
generally little to be praised. At that same time Giovanni Antonio finished an altar-piece
that he had previously begun in oils for S. Maria della Spina, painting in it Our Lady with
the Child in her arms, with S. Mary Magdalene and S. Catharine kneeling before her, and S.
John, S. Sebastian, and S. Joseph standing at the sides; in all which figures he acquitted
himself much better than in the two pictures for the Duomo.

Then, having nothing more to do at Pisa, he made his way to Lucca, where, at S. Ponziano, a
seat of the Monks of Monte Oliveto, an Abbot of his acquaintance caused him to paint a Madonna
on the ascent of a staircase that leads to the dormitory. That work finished, he returned weary,
old, and poor to Siena, where he did not live much longer; for he fell ill, through not having
anyone to look after him or any means of sustenance, and went off to the Great Hospital, and
there in a few weeks he finished the course of his life.

Giovanni Antonio, when young and in good repute, took for his wife in Siena a girl born of
a very good family, and had by her in the first year a daughter. But after that, having grown
weary of her, because he was a beast, he would never see her more; and she, therefore, withdrawing
by herself, lived always on her own earnings and on the interest of her dowry, bearing with
great and endless patience the beastliness and the follies of that husband of hers, who was
truly worthy of the name of Mattaccio which, as has been related, the Monks of Monte Oliveto
gave him.

Riccio of Siena, the disciple of Giovanni Antonio, a passing able and well-practised painter,
having taken as his wife his master's daughter, who had been very well and decently brought
up by her mother, became the heir to all the possessions connected with art of his wife's father.
This Riccio, I say, has executed many beautiful and praiseworthy works at Siena and elsewhere,
and has decorated with stucco and pictures in fresco a chapel in the Duomo of the above-named
city, on the left hand as one enters the church; and he now lives at Lucca, where he has done,
as he still continues to do, many beautiful works worthy to be extolled.

A pupil of Giovanni Antonio, likewise, was a young man who was called Giomo del Sodoma; but,
since he died young, and was not able to give more than a small proof of his genius and knowledge,
there is no need to say more about him.

Sodoma lived seventy-five years, and died in the year 1554.
