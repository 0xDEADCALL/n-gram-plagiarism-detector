SIR,

The Bible lately presented to the Royal Society by Count de Salis, being a version into a language
as little attended to in this country, as it may appear curious to those who take pleasure
in philological inquiries; I embrace this opportunity to communicate to you, and, with your
approbation, to the Society, all that I have been able to collect concerning its history and
present state.

This language is called Romansh, and is now spoken in the most mountainous parts of the country
of the Grisons, near the sources of the Rhine and the Inn. It consists of two main dialects;
which, though partaking both of the above general name, differ however so widely as to constitute
in a manner two distinct languages. Books are printed in both of them; and each, though it
be universally understood in its respective district, is yet sub-divided into almost as many
secondary dialects as there are villages in which it is spoken; which differ, however, but
little except in the pronunciation. One of the main dialects, which is spoken in the Engadine,
a valley extending from the source of the Inn to the frontiers of the Tyrolese, is by the inhabitants
called Ladin. It admits of some variation, even in the books, according as they are printed
either in the upper or the lower part of this province. The abovementioned Bible is in the
dialect of the lower Engadine; which, however, is perfectly understood in the upper part of
that province, where they use no other version. The other dialect, which is the language of
the Grey, or Upper. League, is distinguished from the former by the name of Cialover:[A] and
I must here observe, that in the very centre, and most inaccessible parts of this latter district,
there are some villages situated in the narrow valleys, called Rheinwald, Cepina,[B] &c. in
which a third language is spoken, more similar to the German than to either of the above idioms,
although they be neither contiguous, nor have any great intercourse with the parts where the
German is used.

It being impossible to form any idea of the origin and progress of a language, without attending
to the revolutions that may have contributed to its formation and subsequent variations; and
this being particularly the case in the present instance, wherein no series of documents is
extant to guide us in our researches; I shall briefly recapitulate the principal events which
may have affected the language of the Grisons, as I find them related by authors of approved
veracity.[C]

Ambigatus, the first king of the Celtic Gaul upon record, who[D] about 400[E] years before
Christ, governed all the country situated between the Alps and the Pyrenaean mountains, sent
out two formidable armies under the command of one of his nephews; one of whom, named Segovisius,
forced his way into the heart of Germany: and the other, Bellovisius, having passed the Alps,
penetrated into Italy as far as the settlements of the Tuscans, which at that time extended
over the greatest part of the country now called Lombardy. These, and several other swarms
of invaders whom the successes of the former soon after attracted, having totally subdued that
country, built Milan, Verona, Brescia, and several other considerable towns, and governed with
such tyrannic sway, especially over the nobility, whose riches they coveted and sought by every
means to extort from them, that most of the principal families, joining under the conduct of
Rhætus[F], one of the most distinguished personages among them, retired with the best part
of their effects and attendants among the steepest mountains of the Alps, near the sources
of the Rhine, into the district which is now called the Grey League.

The motive of their flight, their civil deportment, and perhaps more so, the wealth they brought
with them, procured them a favourable reception from the original inhabitants of that inhospitable
region, who are mentioned by authors[G] as being a Celtic nation, fabulously conjectured from
their name [Greek: leipontio][H] to have been left there by Hercules in his expedition into Spain.

The new adventurers had no sooner climbed over the highest precipices, but thinking themselves
secure from the pursuits of their rapacious enemies, they fixed in a valley which, from its
great fertility in comparison of the country they had just passed, they called Domestica[I].
They intermixed with the old inhabitants, and built some towns and many castles, whose present
names manifestly bespeak their origin.[J] They soon after spread all over the country, which
took the name of Rhaetia from that of their leader; and introduced a form of government similar
to their own, of which there are evident traces at this day, especially in the administration
of justice; in which a Laertes or president, now called landamman or ministral, together with
twelve Lucumones[K] or jurors, determine all causes, both civil and criminal:[L] and Livy,[M]
although he erroneously pretends that they retained none of their ancient customs, yet allows
that they continued the use of their language, though somewhat adulterated by a mixture with
that of the Aborigines.

I must here interrupt the thread of this narration by observing, that the only way to account
for the present use of a different language in the centre and most craggy parts of the Grey
League, is by allowing that the Tuscans, who, from the delicacy of their constitutions and
habits, were little able, and less inclined, to encounter the hardships of so severe a climate
and so barren a soil, never attempted to mix with the original and more sturdy inhabitants
of that unfavoured spot; but left them and their language, which could only be a Celtic idiom,
in the primitive state in which they found them.[N]

But to proceed;--several Roman families, dreading the fury of the Carthaginians under Hannibal,
and perhaps, since during the rage of the civil wars, and the subsequent oppressive reigns,
interior commotions and foreign invasions, forsook the Latium and Campania, and resorted for
a peaceful enjoyment of their liberty, some into the islands where Venice now stands, and many
into the mountains of the Grisons, where they chiefly fixed their residence in the Engadine,[O]
as appears not only from the testimonies of authors,[P] but also from the names of several
places and families which are evidently of Roman derivation.[Q]

The inhabitants these emigrants found in that place of refuge could not but be a mixture of
the Tuscans and original Lepontii; and the two languages which met upon this occasion must,
at the very first, have had some affinity; as the Tuscan, which derived immediately from the
Greek, is known to have had a great share in the formation of the Roman. But as it is generally
observed, that the more polished people introduce their native tongue wherever they go to reside
in any considerable numbers, the arrival of these successive colonies must gradually have produced
a considerable change in the language of the country in which they settled;[R] and this change
gave rise to the dialect since called Ladin, probably from the name of the mother country of
its principal authors.[S]

Although the name of Romansh, which the whole language bears, seems to be a badge of Roman
servitude, yet the conquest of that nation, if ever effected, could not have produced a great
alteration in a language which must already have been so similar to their own; and its general
name may as well be attributed to the pacific as to the hostile Romans. But when we consider
that a coalition of the two main dialects, which differ so far as not to be reciprocally understood,
must have been the inevitable consequence of a total reduction; and that such a coalition is
known never to have taken place, we may lay the greater stress upon the many passages of ancient
authors,[T] in which it is implied that the boasted victories of the Romans over the Rhaeti,
for which public honours had been decreed to L. Munatus, M. Anthony, Drusus, and Augustus,
amounted to no more than frequent repulses of those hardy people into their mountains; out
of which their want of sufficient room and sustenance, (which in our days drives considerable
numbers into the services of foreign powers) compelled them at times to make desperate excursions
in quest of necessaries. And we may also from these collected authorities be induced to give
the greater credit to the commentator of Lucan,[U] and to the modern historians,[V] who positively
assert, that the people living near the sources of the Rhine and the Inn were never totally
subdued by the Roman arms; but only repelled in their attempts to harass their neighbours.

This whole country, however, from its central situation, could not but be annumerated to one
of the provinces of the empire; and accordingly we find that Rhaetia itself (which by the accounts
of ancient geographers[W] appears to have extended its limits beyond the lake of Constance,
Augsburg, and Trent, towards Germany, and to Como and Verona towards Italy) was formed into
a Roman province, governed by a pro-consul or procurator, who resided at Augsburg; and that
when in the year 119, the Emperor Adrian divided it into Rhaetia prima and secunda, the governor
of the former, in which the country I am now speaking of must have been comprized, took up
his residence in two castles situated where Coire now stands, whilst the other continued his
seat at Augsburg. But notwithstanding these appearances, no trace or monument of Roman servitude
is to be met with in this district, except the ambiguous name of one mountain,[X] situated
on the skirts of these highlands, and generally thought to have been the non plus ultra of
the Roman arms on the Italian side.

From the difficulty those persevering veterans experienced in keeping this stubborn people
in awe, I mean to infer that such strenuous asserters of their independence, whom the flattering
pens of Ovid and Horace represent as formidable even to Augustus, and preferring death to the
loss of their liberties,[Y] favoured by the natural strength and indigence of their country,
were not very likely to be so far subdued by any foreign power inferior to the Roman, as to
suffer any considerable revolution in their customs and language: for as to the irruptions
of the Goths, Vandals, and Lombards, in the fifth and sixth centuries, besides a profound silence
in history concerning any successful attempt of those barbarians upon this spot, it is scarce
credible, that any of them should have either wished or endeavoured to settle in a country,
perhaps far less hospitable than that which they had just forsaken, especially after they had
opened to themselves a way into the fertile plains of Lombardy.

Some stress must be laid upon this inference, as the history of what befel this country after
the decline of the Roman empire is so intimately blended with that of Suabia, the Tyrolese,
and the lower parts of the Grisons, which are known to have fallen to the share of the rising
power of the Franks, that nothing positive can be drawn from authors as to the interior state
of this small tract. The victory gained in the year 496 near Cologn, by Clovis I. king of the
Franks, over the Alemanni, who had wrested from the Romans all the dominions on the northern
side of the Alps; and the defeat of both Romans and Goths in Italy, in the year 549, by the
treacherous arms of Theodebert king of Austrasia, whose dominions soon after devolved to the
crown of France, necessarily gave the aspiring Merovingian race a great ascendency over all
the countries surrounding the Grisons; and accordingly we find, that this district also was
soon after, without any military effort, considered as part of the dominions of the reviving
western empire. But it does not appear that those monarchs ever made any other use of their
supremacy in these parts than, agreeably to the feudal system which they introduced, to constitute
dukes, earls, presidents, and bailiffs, over Rhaetia; to grant out tenures upon the usual feudal
terms; and consequently to levy forces in most of their military expeditions.

It must, however, be observed, that these feudal substitutes were seldom, if ever, strangers:
those who are upon record to the latter end of the eighth century, having all been chosen from
among the nobility of the country.[Z] And that no foreign garrisons were ever maintained for
any continuance of time in these parts, appears from a circumstance related by their annalists;[AA]
who say, that an inroad of the Huns in 670, when external forces would probably have been very
acceptable to the natives, was repulsed merely by a concourse of the inhabitants.

History continues to furnish us with proofs of the little connexion this people had with other
nations in their domestic affairs, notwithstanding their dependance upon a foreign power. In
the year 780, the Bishop of Coire, who by the constitution of that see can only be a native,[AB]
obtained from Charlemain, besides many considerable honours and privileges in the empire, a
grant of the supreme authority in this country, by the investiture of the office of hereditary
president or bailiff over all Rhaetia. His successors not only enjoyed this prerogative to
the extinction of the Carlovingian race of emperors in 911; but received accumulated favours
from other succeeding monarchs, as the bigoted devotion of those times or motives of interest
prompted them. And so far did their munificence gradually extend, that the sole property of
one of the three leagues[AC] was at one time vested in the hands of the bishop.

This prelate and the nobles, the greatest part of whom became his retainers, availed themselves,
like all the German princes, of the confusion, divisions, and interreigns which frequently
distracted the empire in the succeeding centuries, in order to establish a firm and unlimited
authority of their own. Henceforth the annals of this country furnish us with little more than
catalogues of the bishops and dukes, who were still, at times, nominated by the emperors; and
of the domains granted out by them to different indigenate families; with accounts of the atrocious
cruelties exercised by these lords over their vassals; and with anecdotes of the prowess of
the natives in several expeditions into Italy and Palestine, in which they still voluntarily
accompanied the emperors.

The repeated acts of tyranny exercised by those arbitrary despots, who had now shaken off all
manner of restraint, at length exasperated the people into a general revolt, and brought on
the confederacy; in which the bishop and most of the nobles were glad to join, in order to
screen themselves from the fury of the insurgents.

The first step towards this happy revolution was made by some venerable old men dressed in
the coarse grey cloth of the country, who in the year 1424 met privately in a wood near a place
called Truns, in the Upper League; where, impressed with a sense of their former liberties,[AD]
they determined to remonstrate against, and oppose, the violent proceedings of their oppressors.
The abbot Dissentis was the first who countenanced their measures; their joint influence gradually
prevailed over several of the most moderate among the nobles; and hence arose the league which,
from the colour of its first promoters, was ever called the Grey League; which, from its being
the first in the bold attempt to shake off the yoke of wanton tyranny, has ever since retained
the pre-eminence in rank before the two other leagues; and which has even given its name to
the whole country, whose inhabitants, from the circumstances of their deliverance, pride themselves
in the appellation of Grisones, or the grey-ones.[AE] From this period nothing has ever affected
their freedom and absolute independence, which they now enjoy in the most unlimited sense,
in spite of the repeated efforts of the house of Austria to recover some degree of ascendency
over them.

From this concise view of the history of the Grisons, in which I have carefully guarded against
favouring any particular hypothesis, it appears, that as no foreign nation ever gained any
permanent footing in the most mountainous parts of this country since the establishment of
the Tuscans and Romans, the language now spoken could never have suffered any considerable
alterations from extraneous mixtures of modern languages. And to those who may object, that
languages like all other human institutions will, though left to themselves, be inevitably
affected by the common revolutions of time, I shall observe, that a language, in which no books
are written, but which is only spoken by a people chiefly devoted to arms and agriculture,
and consequently not cultivated by the criticisms of men of taste and learning, is by no means
exposed to the vicissitudes of those that are polished by refined nations;[AF] and that, however
paradoxical it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that the degeneracy of a language is more
frequently to be attributed to an extravagant refinement than to the neglect of an illiterate
people, unless indeed external causes interfere. May we not hence conclude, that as the Romansh
has never been used in any regular composition in writing till the sixteenth century, nor affected
by any foreign invasion or intimate connexion, it is not likely to have received any material
change before the period of its being written? And we have the authority of the books since
printed to prove, that it is at present the identical language that was spoken two hundred
years ago. These arguments will receive additional weight from the proofs I shall hereafter
give of the great affinity there is between the language as it is now spoken, and the Romance
that was used in France nine centuries ago.

When we further consider the facts I have above briefly related, the wonder will cease, that
in a cluster of mountains, situated in the centre of Europe, a distinct language (not a dialect
or jargon of those spoken by the contiguous nations, as has been generally imagined) should
have maintained itself through a series of ages, in spite of the many revolutions which frequently
changed the whole face of the adjacent countries. And indeed, so obstinately tenacious are
these people of their independency, laws, customs, and consequently of their very language,
that, as has been already observed, their form of government, especially in judicial matters,
still bears evident marks of the ancient Tuscan constitution; and that, although they be frequently
exposed to inconveniences from their stubbornness in this respect, they have not yet been prevailed
upon to adopt the Gregorian reformation of the calendar.

As to the nature of this language, it may now be advanced, with some degree of confidence,
that the Cialover owes it origin to a mixture of the Tuscan and of the dialect of the Celtic
spoken by the Lepontii; and that the introduction of the vulgar Roman affected it in some degree,
but particularly gave rise to the Ladin; the vocabulary of which, as any one may be convinced
by inspecting a few lines of the bible, has a great affinity with that of the Latin tongue.
But these assertions rest merely upon historical evidence; for as to the Cialover, all that
it may have retained of the Tuscan or Roman, is so much disfigured by an uncouth pronunciation
and a vague orthography, that all etymological inquiries are thereby rendered intricate and
unsatisfactory. And as to the Ladin, although its derivation be more manifest, yet we are equally
at a loss from what period or branch of the Latin tongue to trace its real origin; for I have
found, after many tedious experiments, that even the vocabulary, in which the resemblance is
most evident, differs equally from the classical purity of Tully, Caesar, and Sallust, as it
does from the primitive Latin of the twelve tables, of Ennius, and the columna rostralis of
Duillius, which has generally been thought the parent of the Gallic Romance; as also from the
trivial language of Varro, Vegetius, and Columella. May we not from this circumstance infer,
that, as is the case in all vernacular tongues, the vulgar dialect of the Romans, the sermo
usualis, rusticus, pedestris,[AG] of which there are no monuments extant, differed very widely
both in pronunciation and construction from that which has at any time been used either in
writing or in the senate?

The grammatical variations, the syntax, and the genius of the language, must in this, as well
as in several other modern European tongues, have been derived from the Celtic; it being well
known, that the frequent use of articles, the distinction of cases by prepositions, the application
of two auxiliaries in the conjugations, do by no means agree with the Latin turn of expression;
although a late French academician[AH] who has taken great pains to prove that the Gallic Romance
was solely derived from the Roman, quotes several instances in which even the most classical
writers have in this respect offended the purity of that refined language. It cannot here be
denied, that as new ideas always require new signs to express them, some foreign words, and
perhaps phrases, must necessarily, from time to time, have insinuated themselves into the Romansh,
by the military and some commercial intercourse of the Grisons with other nations; and this
accounts for several modern German words which are now incorporated into the language of the
Engadine.[AI]

The little connexion there is in mountainous countries between the inhabitants of the different
valleys, and the absolute independence of each jurisdiction in this district, which still lessens
the frequency of their intercourse, also accounts, in a great measure, for the variety of secondary
dialects subsisting in almost every different community or even village.

The oldest specimens of writing in this language are some dramatical performances in verse
upon scriptural subjects, which are extant only in manuscript. The Histories of Susanna, of
the Prodigal Son, of Judith and Holofernes, and of Esther, are among the first; and are said
to have been composed about the year 1560. The books that have since been printed are chiefly
upon religious subjects; and among those that are not so, the only I have ever heard of are
a small code of the laws of the country in the Cialover dialect, and an epitome of Sprecher's
Chronicle, by Da Porta, in the Ladin.

The language spoken in Gaul from the fifth to the twelfth centuries being evidently a mixture
of the same Roman and Celtic ingredients, and partaking of the same name with those of the
Grisons; it will, I hope, not be thought foreign to the subject of this letter, if I enter
into a few particulars concerning it, as it seems to have been an essential part, or rather
the trunk, of the language, the history of which I am endeavouring to elucidate.

One of the many instances how little the laboured researches of philologists into the origin
of languages are to be depended upon, is the variety of opinions entertained by French authors
concerning the formation of the Gallic Romance. A learned Benedictine[AJ] first starts the
conjecture, and then maintains it against the attacks of an anonymous writer, that the vulgar
Latin became the universal language of Gaul immediately after Caesar's conquest, and that its
corruption, with very little mixture of the original language of the country, gradually produced
the Romance towards the eighth century. Bonamy,[AK] on the other hand, is of opinion, that
soon after that conquest, a corruption of vulgar Latin by the Celtic formed the Romance, which
he takes to be the language always meant by authors when they speak of the Lingua Romana used
in Gaul. The author of the Celtic Dictionary[AL] tells us, that the Romance is derived from
the Latin, the Celtic, which he more frequently calls Gallic, and the Teutonic; in admitting
of which latter he deviates from most other authors,[AM] who deny that the Teutonic had any
share in the composition of the Romance, since the Franks found it already established when
they entered Gaul, and were long before they could prevail upon their new subjects to adopt
any part of their own mother tongue, which however appears to have been afterwards instrumental
in the formation of the modern French. Duclos,[AN] guided, I imagine, by du Cange,[AO] whose
opinion appears to be the most sober and best authenticated, maintains that the vulgar Latin
was undoubtedly the foundation of the Romance; but that much of the Celtic gradually insinuated
itself in spite of the policy of the Romans, who never failed to use all their endeavours in
order to establish their language wherever they spread their arms.

Among this variety of conjectures and acute controversies, I find it however agreed on all
hands, that the vocabulary of the Roman, and the idiom of the Celtic, have chiefly contributed
to the formation of the Gallic, Romance, which is sufficient to prove that it partakes of a
common origin with that of the Grisons.

There are incontestable proofs that this language was once universal all over France; and that
this, and not immediately the Latin, has been the parent of the Provençal, and afterwards of
the modern French, the Italian, and the Spanish. The oath taken by Lewis the Germanic, in the
year 842, in confirmation of an alliance between him and Charles the Bald his brother, is a
decisive proof of the general use of the Romance by the whole French nation at that time, and
of their little knowledge of the Teutonic, which being the native tongue of Lewis, would certainly
have been used by him, in this oath, had it been understood by the French to whom he addressed
himself. But Nithardus,[AP] a contemporary writer and near relation to the contracting parties,
informs us, that Lewis took the oath in the Romance language, in order that it might be understood
by the French nobility who were the subjects of Charles; and that they, in their turn, entered
into reciprocal engagements in their own language, which the same author again declares to
have been the Romance, and not the Teutonic; although one would imagine that, had they at all
understood this latter tongue, they could not but have used it upon this occasion, in return
for the condescension of Lewis.

As a comparison between this language and the Romansh of the Grisons cannot be considered as
a mere object of curiosity, but may also serve to corroborate the proofs I have above alleged
of the antiquity of the latter, I have annexed in the appendix,[AQ] a translation of this oath
into the language of Engadine, which approaches nearest to it; although I must observe, that
there are in the other dialect some words which have a still greater affinity with the language
of the oath, as appears by another translation I have procured, in which both dialects are
indifferently used. To prevent any doubts concerning the veracity of these translations, I
must here declare, that I am indebted for them, and for several anecdotes concerning that language,
to a man of letters, who is a native and has long been an inhabitant of the Grisons, and is
lately come to reside in London. I have added to this comparative view of those two languages,
the Latin words from which both seem to have been derived; and, as a proof of the existence
of the Gallic Romance in France down to the twelfth century, I have also subjoined the words
used in that kingdom at that period, as they are given us by the author of the article (Langue)
Romane, in the French Encyclopedie.

To the comparison of the two Romances, and the similarity of their origin, I may now with confidence
add the authority of Fontanini[AR] to prove, that they are one and the same language. This
author, speaking of the ancient Gallic Romance, asserts that it is now spoken in the country
of the Grisons; though, not attending to the variety of dialects, some of which have certainly
nothing of the Italian, he supposes it to have been altogether adulterated by a mixture of
that modern tongue.

Whilst the Grisons neglected to improve their language, and rejected, or indeed were out of
the reach of every refinement it might have derived from polished strangers, the taste and
fertile genius of the Troubadours, fostered by the countenance and elegance of the brilliant
courts and splendid nobility of Provence, did not long leave theirs in the rough state in which
we find it in the ninth century. But the change having been gradual and almost imperceptible,
the French historians have fixed no epocha for the transition of the Romance into the Provençal.
That the former language had not received any considerable alteration in the twelfth Century
may be gathered from the comparison in the appendix: and, that it still bore the same name,
appears from the titles of several books which are said to have been written in, or translated
into, the Romance. But though mention is made of that name even after this aera, yet upon examining
impartially what is given us for that language in this period, it will be found so different
from the Romance of the ninth century, that to trace it any further would be both a vain and
an extravagant pursuit.

Admitting, however, the universal use of the Romance all over France down to the twelfth century,
which no French author has yet doubted or denied; and allowing that what the writers of those
times say of the Gallic is to be understood of the Romance, as appears from chronological proofs,
and the expressions of several authors prior to the fifth century;[AS] who, by distinguishing
the Gallic both from the Latin and the Celtic, plainly indicate that they thereby mean the
Romance, those being the only three languages which, before the invasion of the Franks, could
possibly have been spoken, or even understood in Gaul: admitting these premises, I say, it
necessarily follows, that the language introduced into England under Alfred, and afterwards
more universally established by Edward the Confessor, and William the Conqueror, must have
been an emanation of the Romance, very near akin to that of the abovementioned oath, and consequently
to that which is now spoken in the Alps.

The intercourse between Britain and Gaul is known to have been of a very early date; for even
in the first century we find, that the British lawyers derived the greatest part of their knowledge
from those of the continent;[AT] while on the other hand, the Gallic Druids are known to have
resorted to Britain for instruction in their mysterious rites. The Britons, therefore, could
not be totally ignorant of the Gallic language. And hence it will appear, that Grimbald, John,
and the other doctors introduced by Alfred,[AU] could find no great difficulty in propagating
their native tongue in this island; which tongue, at that interval of time, could only be the
true Romance, since they were contemporaries with Lewis the Germanic.

That the Romance was almost universally understood in this kingdom under Edward the Confessor,
it being not only used at court, but frequently at the bar, and even sometimes in the pulpit,
is a fact too well known and attested[AV] to need my further authenticating it with superfluous
arguments and testimonies.

Duclos, in his History of the Gallic' Romance,[AW] gives the abovementioned oath of Lewis as
the first monument of that language. The second he mentions is the code of laws of William
the Conqueror,[AX] whom the least proficient in the English history knows to have rendered
his language almost universal in this kingdom. How little progress it had yet made towards
the modern French; and how great an affinity it still bore with the present Romansh of the
Grisons, will appear from the annexed translation of the first paragraph of these laws into
the latter tongue.[AY]

If we may credit Du Cange,[AZ] who grounds his assertion upon various instruments of the kings
of Scotland during the twelfth century, the Romance had also penetrated into that kingdom before
that period.

The same corruption, or coalescence, which gave rise to the Gallic Romance, and to that of
the Grisons, must also have produced in Italy a language, if not perfectly similar, at least
greatly approaching to those two idioms. Nor did it want its northern nations to contribute
what the two other branches derived from that source.[BA] But be the origin what it will, certain
it is, that a jargon very different from either the Latin or the Italian was spoken in Italy
from the time of the irruptions of the barbarians to the successful labours of Dante and Petrarca;
that this jargon was usually called the vulgar idiom; but that Speroni,[BB] the father of an
Italian literature, and others, frequently call it the common Italian Romance. And if Fontanini's[BC]
authorities be sufficient, it appears that even the Gallic Romance, by the residence of the
papal court at Avignon, and from other causes, made its way into Italy before it was polished
into the Provençal.

As to Naples and Sicily, the expulsion of the Saracens by the Normans, under Robert Guiscard
in 1059, must have produced in that country nearly the same effect, a similar event soon after
brought about in England. And in fact we have the authority of William of Apulia[BD] to prove,
that the conquerors used all their efforts to propagate their language and manners among the
natives, that they might ever after be considered only as one people. And Hugo Falcland[BE]
relates, that in the year 1150, Count Henry refused to take upon him the management of public
affairs, under pretence of not knowing the language of the French; which, he adds, was absolutely
necessary at court.

That the language of the Romans penetrated very early into Spain, appears most evidently from
a passage in Strabo,[BF] who asserts that the Turditani inhabiting the banks of the Boetis,
now the Guadalquivir, forgot their original tongue, and adopted that of the conquerors. That
the Romance was used there in the fourteenth century appears from a correspondence between
St. Vincent of Ferrieres and Don Martin, son of Peter the IVth of Arragon;[BG] and that this
language must once have been common in that kingdom appears manifestly from the present name
of the Spanish, which is still usually called Romance.[BH] These circumstances considered,
I am not so much inclined to discredit a fact related by Mabillon,[BI] who says, that in the
eighth century a paralytic Spaniard, on paying his devotions at the tomb of a saint in the
church of Fulda, conversed with a monk of that abbey, who, because he was an Italian, understood
the language of the Spaniard. Neither does an oral tradition I heard some times ago appear
so absurd to me, as it did when it was first related to me, which says, that two Catalonians
travelling over the Alps, were not a little surprized when they came into the Grison country,
to find that their native tongue was understood by the inhabitants, and that they could comprehend
most of the language of that district.

This universality of the Romance in the French dominions during the eleventh century, also
accounts for its introduction in Palestine and many other parts of the Levant by Godfrey de
Bouillon, and the multitude of adventurers who engaged under him in the Crusade. The assizes
of Jerusalem, and those of Cyprus, are standing monuments of the footing that language had
obtained in those parts; and if we may trust a Spanish historian of some reputation[BJ] who
resided in Greece in the thirteenth century, the Athenians and the inhabitants of Morea spoke
at that time the same language that was used in France. And there is great reason to imagine,
that the affinity the Lingua Franca bears to the French and Italian is intirely to be derived
from the Romance, which was once commonly used in the ports of the Levant. The heroic atchievements
and gallantry of the knights of the cross also gave rise to the swarm of fabulous narratives;
which, though not an invention of those days, were yet, from the name of the language in which
they were written, ever after distinguished by the appellation of Romances.[BK]

I shall now conclude this letter by observing, that far from presuming that the Romance has
been preserved so near its primitive state only in the country of the Grisons, there is great
reason to suppose that it still exists in several other remote and unfrequented parts. When
Fontanini informs us[BL] that the ancient Romance is now spoken in the country of the Grisons,
he adds, that it is also the common dialect of the Friulese, and of some districts in Savoy
bordering upon Dauphiné. And Rivet[BM] seriously undertakes to prove, that the Patois of several
parts of the Limousin, Quercy, and Auvergne (which in fact agrees singularly with the Romansh
of the Grisons) is the very Romance of eight centuries ago. Neither do I doubt, but what some
inquisitive traveller might still meet with manifest traces of it in many parts of the Pyrenaeans
and other mountainous regions of Spain, where the Moors and other invaders have never penetrated.

I have the honour to be, &c.
