"A DAUGHTER OF ST. PETER'S"

  (MRS. WM. COX ALLEN.)

  *In Paper Cover, 30 Cents.
    "  Cloth    "   50   "*

Lovell's Canadian Authors' Series, No. 60.

The authoress is a Canadian, and her story is remarkably well told.--Advertiser, London.

In this work a new aspirant for literary honors in the field of fiction makes her first appearance
before the public. The story which she tells is neither lengthy nor involved. It is a simple,
prettily told story of love at first sight, with a happy ending, and little to divert the mind
of the reader from the hero and heroine. Mrs. Conger's literary style is pleasing, and her
production evidences a well cultured mind and a tolerable appreciation of character. Her book
will be found very pleasant reading.--"Intelligencer," Belleville.

The plot is ingeniously constructed, and its working out furnishes the opportunity for some
dramatic situations. The heroine, of whose early life the title gives us a hint, is a creature
all grace and tenderness, a true offspring of the sunny south. The hero is an American, a man
of wealth, and an artist in posse. The other dramatis personæ, who play their parts around
these central figures, are mostly Italians or Americans. The great question to be solved is:
Who is Merlina? In supplying the solution, the author takes occasion to introduce us to an
obscure but interesting class of people. The denouement of "A Daughter of St. Peter's" is somewhat
startling, but we must not impair the reader's pleasure by anticipation. We see from the advanced
sheets that it is dedicated to the Canadian public, to whom we cordially commend it.--The Gazette,
Montreal.

For a first effort, which the authoress in her preface modestly says the novel is, "A Daughter
of St. Peter's" must be pronounced a very promising achievement. The plot is well constructed
and the story entertaining and well told. The style is light and agreeable, and with a little
more experience and facility in novel-writing we may expect Mrs. Conger, if she essays a second
trial, to produce a book that will surpass the decided merits of "A Daughter of St. Peter's."--Free
Press, London.
