My conjecture about The Magic Gate (HUTCHINSON) is that its author, MAUD STEPNEY RAWSON, found
herself with two stories to choose from, one of the Gate itself, and another of the romance
of Lydia and John Wodrush. In my opinion she chose the wrong one. The history of the Wodrush
elopement, compressed to a couple of pages, seems to me far more original and interesting than
the present rather unwieldy tale. The Magic Gate is a war-novel confessed, and I can only fancy
that the thronging new sensations of the past three years have proved a little too much for
Mrs. RAWSON'S sense of form. She is so anxious that her heroine and her readers shall miss
nothing of it all that in the result the plot is lost in a maze of incidents that lead nowhere.
The effect produced on a small country society by the early phases of the War is shown deftly
enough. But perhaps posterity will find in such a record a more compelling interest than we
can to whom it is still so familiar in every unforgettable detail. One other ground of complaint
I have against the book is that its most original and attractive character, the American woman
to whose generosity Jennet owes her occupancy of Fullbrook Manor, is banished at an early page,
and submarined just when I was looking for her reappearance. Hers is yet another story with
which Mrs. RAWSON might have entertained me better than by this of The Magic Gate, which I
found a trifle creaky on its hinges.

Senlis (COLLINS) is one of the many places that have been systematically destroyed by the Germans.
It is difficult for anyone who has not seen the results with his own eyes to realise the business-like
thoroughness which the Hun brings to this congenial task. That a part (and the most beautiful)
of the town still stands does not imply that he yielded either to slackness or to æsthetic
refinement. True that Miss CICELY HAMILTON relates a pleasing story that Senlis was saved from
utter destruction by the entreaties of the curé, but, all the same, I think the real reason
why the Bosch did not complete his work was that he was bundled out bag and baggage before
he had time to add the finishing touches. Miss HAMILTON clearly and soberly states the case
against him, and makes it all the more damning by her frank recognition that many of the horrors
of war, whoever makes it, are inevitable. Her delightful account of Senlis itself, admirably
illustrated with photographs, is certain to appeal to all lovers of the charm of old French
towns; and the more poignantly when they recall how narrowly the best of its beauty escaped
from the hand of the spoiler.

MR. PUNCH AS PROPAGANDIST.

I don't know what decided him to do it. I think he must have been a little fed up with our
silly British way (rather attractive, all the same) of assuming that the whole world is bound
to recognise the justice of our point of view without the use of propaganda to stimulate its
intelligence.

Or else he had read somewhere that the Bolsheviks had been flooding the Hun trenches with Socialist
literature and that the German Headquarters Staff had protested against this kind of thing
as being contrary to etiquette, and he thought he couldn't go far wrong if he did something
that was contrary to Bosch etiquette.

Anyhow he started off in his Bouverie biplane to distribute a million or so leaflets of his
own composition over the whole expanse of the Fatherland. It has been my privilege to read
a sample which he handed to me just before leaving earth. It runs as follows:--

"GERMANS--Your Kaiser has taken good care that his Press should keep you in ignorance of the
feelings with which your nation is regarded by the civilized world. I am therefore about to
oblige you with a few home-truths.

"You have probably heard a rumour that we and our Allies have no quarrel with the German people,
but only with its rulers. Don't you believe a word of it. Possibly we still respected you when
the War began, for we had not guessed how many of you had been looking forward for years to
the coming of 'The Day.' It is what we have found out about you since you started fighting
that has made us loathe and despise you.

"When, as a nation, you accepted without protest the filthy savagery of your armies in Belgium
and other occupied lands; when even your women were vile in their cruelty to the helpless prisoners
you had taken; when you rang your church bells and waved flags and took holidays for joy of
the murder of innocent women and children, we were not deceived by apologists who explained
that your only defect was that you were the slaves of a brutal militarism (though you were
that, all right). We knew that you must have something of the beast in your hearts. How it
got there was another matter; we only knew that it was there and that while it remained you
were not fit for intercourse with decent men.

"Another thing that you may have heard (for even some of our own statesmen, reputed intelligent,
have said it, and it has no doubt been eagerly seized upon by the officials who control your
Press), is that your form of Government, the particular pattern of tyranny under which you
elect to grovel, is no concern of ours. Well, don't you believe that either. This is no question
of private taste, like the cut of your shoulder-pads or the shape of your women's waists, which
are matters of purely local interest. Your type of Government is as much our concern; as the
quality of your poison-gas or the composition of the bombs that you drop on our babies.

"I am reminded of the nonsense that used to be talked by responsible statesmen at the time
when you were feverishly building a fleet to dispute our right to ensure the freedom of the
seas. We were told that you were at perfect liberty to do so if you chose, and that it was
not for us to interfere with your arrangements. Yet everybody knew all the time that there
was nothing in the world that concerned us so closely. If France had been massing troops on
your frontier you would at once have asked her to state her intentions, or even possibly have
taken action without asking her. Well, the sea is our frontier.

"You are to understand, then (whatever anybody may say), that everything done in Germany that
bears immediately upon our relations with your State is of prime concern to us. Our desire
for peace is as strong as your need of it; but we cannot afford to make terms with a Government
whose word, as we have proved, is not worth the paper they write it on--who would treat any
peace as a mere armistice to give them breathing-space for preparing a fresh war. No, if you
want peace you will have to displace your present rulers. You are so good at 'substitutes'
that you ought to have no difficulty about that.

"And the sooner the better for you. For as this War drags on we are not getting to love you
more. Even now it will take you at least a generation to purge your offence and get back into
the community of civilized nations. But there is another thought that is more likely to affect
your thick commercial hides, and it is this. Unless you take steps, and pretty soon, to put
yourselves in a position in which we can treat with you, you will be boycotted in the markets
of the world, and you will go bankrupt. It is for you, the German people, to decide whether
you choose this fate. Meanwhile Time presses and the sands run low."

Such was the matter of the leaflet that Mr. Punch rained down from his Bouverie biplane (fortunately
invulnerable) upon the cities of the Fatherland. Till now the German people, fed on windy tales
of triumph in place of solid food, had borne their sufferings patiently as trials incident
to all wars even when you are told that you are winning them. This was the first intimation
they had received of the facts. For the first time they had a chance of seeing themselves as
others saw them.

He carried no bombs, but as he flew over Potsdam he could not refrain from letting fall, by
way of reprisal, a weighty souvenir upon the purlieus of the Imperial Palace. Dropped at a
venture, there is reason to believe that it fell within measurable distance of the head-piece
of the All-Highest. It was Mr. Punch's
