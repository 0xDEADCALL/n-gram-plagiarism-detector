I had occasionally done so when a child, and had suddenly woke up.

"Well, we will take no oaths on the subject; but you yourself believe in the soul.

"Like enough, brother; gypsies have been transported before now for choring."

"To hokkawar?"

CHAPTER XVII

The Public-house--Landlord on His Legs Again--A Blow in Season--The Way of the World--The Grateful
Mind--The Horse's Neigh.

It was rather late on the following morning when I awoke.  At first I was almost unconscious
of what had occurred on the preceding day; recollection, however, by degrees returned, and
I felt a deep melancholy coming over me, but perfectly aware that no advantage could be derived
from the indulgence of such a feeling, I sprang up, prepared my breakfast, which I ate with
a tolerable appetite, and then left the dingle, and betook myself to the gypsy encampment,
where I entered into discourse with various Romanies, both male and female.  After some time,
feeling myself in better spirits, I determined to pay another visit to the landlord of the
public-house.  From the position of his affairs when I had last visited him I entertained rather
gloomy ideas with respect to his present circumstances.  I imagined that I should either find
him alone in his kitchen smoking a wretched pipe, or in company with some surly bailiff or
his follower, whom his friend the brewer had sent into the house in order to take possession
of his effects.

Nothing more entirely differing from either of these anticipations could have presented itself
to my view than what I saw about one o'clock in the afternoon, when I entered the house.  I
had come, though somewhat in want of consolation myself, to offer any consolation which was
at my command to my acquaintance Catchpole, and perhaps like many other people who go to a
house with "drops of compassion trembling on their eyelids," I felt rather disappointed at
finding that no compassion was necessary.  The house was thronged with company, and cries for
ale and porter, hot brandy and water, cold gin and water, were numerous; moreover, no desire
to receive and not to pay for the landlord's liquids was manifested--on the contrary, everybody
seemed disposed to play the most honourable part: "Landlord, here's the money for this glass
of brandy and water--do me the favour to take it; all right, remember I have paid you."  "Landlord,
here's the money for the pint of half-and-half-fourpence halfpenny, ain't it?--here's sixpence;
keep the change--confound the change!"  The landlord, assisted by his niece, bustled about;
his brow erect, his cheeks plumped out, and all his features exhibiting a kind of surly satisfaction.
Wherever he moved, marks of the most cordial amity were shown him, hands were thrust out to
grasp his, nor were looks of respect, admiration, nay, almost of adoration, wanting.  I observed
one fellow, as the landlord advanced, take the pipe out of his mouth, and gaze upon him with
a kind of grin of wonder, probably much the same as his ancestor, the Saxon lout of old, put
on when he saw his idol Thur, dressed in a new kirtle.  To avoid the press, I got into a corner,
where on a couple of chairs sat two respectable-looking individuals, whether farmers or sow-
gelders, I know not, but highly respectable-looking, who were discoursing about the landlord.
"Such another," said one, "you will not find in a summer's day."  "No, nor in the whole of
England," said the other.  "Tom of Hopton," said the first: "ah!  Tom of Hopton," echoed the
other; "the man who could beat Tom of Hopton could beat the world."  "I glory in him," said
the first.  "So do I," said the second, "I'll back him against the world.  Let me hear any
one say anything against him, and if I don't--" then, looking at me, he added, "have you anything
to say against him, young man?"  "Not a word," said I, "save that he regularly puts me out."
"He'll put any one out," said the man, "any one out of conceit with himself;" then, lifting
a mug to his mouth, he added, with a hiccough, "I drink his health."  Presently the landlord,
as he moved about, observing me, stopped short: "Ah!" said he, "are you here?  I am glad to
see you, come this way.  Stand back," said he to his company, as I followed him to the bar,
"stand back for me and this gentleman."  Two or three young fellows were in the bar, seemingly
sporting yokels, drinking sherry and smoking.  "Come, gentlemen," said the landlord, "clear
the bar, I must have a clear bar for me and my friend here." "Landlord, what will you take,"
said one, "a glass of sherry?  I know you like it."  "- sherry and you too," said the landlord,
"I want neither sherry nor yourself; didn't you hear what I told you?"  "All right, old fellow,"
said the other, shaking the landlord by the hand, "all right, don't wish to intrude--but I
suppose when you and your friend have done, I may come in again;" then, with a "sarvant, sir,"
to me, he took himself into the kitchen, followed by the rest of the sporting yokels.

Thereupon the landlord, taking a bottle of ale from a basket, uncorked it, and pouring the
contents into two large glasses, handed me one, and motioning me to sit down, placed himself
by me; then, emptying his own glass at a draught, he gave a kind of grunt of satisfaction,
and fixing his eyes upon the opposite side of the bar, remained motionless, without saying
a word, buried apparently in important cogitations.  With respect to myself, I swallowed my
ale more leisurely, and was about to address my friend, when his niece, coming into the bar,
said that more and more customers were arriving, and how she should supply their wants she
did not know, unless her uncle would get and help her.

"The customers!" said the landlord, "let the scoundrels wait till you have time to serve them,
or till I have leisure to see after them."  "The kitchen won't contain half of them," said
his niece.  "Then let them sit out abroad," said the landlord.  "But there are not benches
enough, uncle," said the niece.  "Then let them stand or sit on the ground," said the uncle,
"what care I; I'll let them know that the man who beat Tom of Hopton stands as well again on
his legs as ever."  Then opening a side door which led from the bar into the back yard, he
beckoned me to follow him.  "You treat your customers in rather a cavalier manner," said I,
when we were alone together in the yard.

"Don't I?" said the landlord; "and I'll treat them more so yet; now I have got the whiphand
of the rascals I intend to keep it.  I dare say you are a bit surprised with regard to the
change which has come over things since you were last here.  I'll tell you how it happened.
You remember in what a desperate condition you found me, thinking of changing my religion,
selling my soul to the man in black, and then going and hanging myself like Pontius Pilate;
and I dare say you can't have forgotten how you gave me good advice, made me drink ale, and
give up sherry.  Well, after you were gone, I felt all the better for your talk, and what you
had made me drink, and it was a mercy that I did feel better; for my niece was gone out, poor
thing, and I was left alone in the house, without a soul to look at, or to keep me from doing
myself a mischief in case I was so inclined.  Well, things wore on in this way till it grew
dusk, when in came that blackguard Hunter with his train to drink at my expense, and to insult
me as usual; there were more than a dozen of them, and a pretty set they looked.  Well, they
ordered about in a very free and easy manner for upwards of an hour and a half, occasionally
sneering and jeering at me, as they had been in the habit of doing for some time past; so,
as I said before, things wore on, and other customers came in, who, though they did not belong
to Hunter's gang, also passed off their jokes upon me; for, as you perhaps know, we English
are a set of low hounds, who will always take part with the many by way of making ourselves
safe, and currying favour with the stronger side.  I said little or nothing, for my spirits
had again become very low, and I was verily scared and afraid.  All of a sudden I thought of
the ale which I had drank in the morning, and of the good it did me then, so I went into the
bar, opened another bottle, took a glass, and felt better; so I took another, and feeling better
still, I went back into the kitchen, just as Hunter and his crew were about leaving.  'Mr.
Hunter,' said I, 'you and your people will please to pay me for what you have had?'  'What
do you mean by my people?' said he, with an oath.  'Ah, what do you mean by calling us his
people?' said the clan.  'We are nobody's people;' and then there was a pretty load of abuse,
and threatening to serve me out. 'Well,' said I, 'I was perhaps wrong to call them your people,
and beg your pardon and theirs.  And now you will please to pay me for what you have had yourself,
and afterwards I can settle with them.'  'I shall pay you when I think fit,' said Hunter. 
'Yes,' said the rest, 'and so shall we.  We shall pay you when we think fit.'  'I tell you
what,' said Hunter, 'I conceives I do such an old fool as you an honour when I comes into his
house and drinks his beer, and goes away without paying for it;' and then there was a roar
of laughter from everybody, and almost all said the same thing.  'Now do you please to pay
me, Mr. Hunter?' said I.  'Pay you!' said Hunter; 'pay you!  Yes, here's the pay;' and thereupon
he held out his thumb, twirling it round till it just touched my nose.  I can't tell you what
I felt that moment; a kind of madhouse thrill came upon me, and all I know is, that I bent
back as far as I could, then lunging out, struck him under the ear, sending him reeling two
or three yards, when he fell on the floor.  I wish you had but seen how my company looked at
me and at each other.  One or two of the clan went to raise Hunter, and get him to fight, but
it was no go; though he was not killed, he had had enough for that evening.  Oh, I wish you
had seen my customers; those who did not belong to the clan, but who had taken part with them,
and helped to jeer and flout me, now came and shook me by the hand, wishing me joy, and saying
as, how 'I was a brave fellow, and had served the bully right!'  As for the clan, they all
said Hunter was bound to do me justice; so they made him pay me what he owed for himself, and
the reckoning of those among them who said they had no money.  Two or three of them then led
him away, while the rest stayed behind, and flattered me, and worshipped me, and called Hunter
all kinds of dogs' names.  What do you think of that?"

"Why," said I, "it makes good what I read in a letter which I received yesterday.  It is just
the way of the world."

"A'n't it," said the landlord.  "Well, that a'n't all; let me go on.  Good fortune never yet
came alone.  In about an hour comes home my poor niece, almost in high sterricks with joy,
smiling and sobbing.  She had been to the clergyman of M---, the great preacher, to whose church
she was in the habit of going, and to whose daughters she was well known; and to him she told
a lamentable tale about my distresses, and about the snares which had been laid for my soul;
and so well did she plead my cause, and so strong did the young ladies back all she said, that
the good clergyman promised to stand my friend, and to lend me sufficient money to satisfy
the brewer, and to get my soul out of the snares of the man in black; and sure enough the next
morning the two young ladies brought me the fifty pounds, which I forthwith carried to the
brewer, who was monstrously civil, saying that he hoped any little misunderstanding we had
had would not prevent our being good friends in future.  That a'n't all; the people of the
neighbouring county hearing as if by art witchcraft that I had licked Hunter, and was on good
terms with the brewer, forthwith began to come in crowds to look at me, pay me homage, and
be my customers. Moreover, fifty scoundrels who owed me money, and would have seen me starve
rather than help me as long as they considered me a down pin, remembered their debts, and came
and paid me more than they owed.  That a'n't all; the brewer being about to establish a stage-coach
and three, to run across the country, says it shall stop and change horses at my house, and
the passengers breakfast and sup as it goes and returns.  He wishes me--whom he calls the best
man in England--to give his son lessons in boxing, which he says he considers a fine manly
English art, and a great defence against Popery--notwithstanding that only a month ago, when
he considered me a down pin, he was in the habit of railing against it as a blackguard practice,
and against me as a blackguard for following it; so I am going to commence with young hopeful
to-morrow."

"I really cannot help congratulating you on your good fortune," said I.

"That a'n't all," said the landlord.  "This very morning the folks of our parish made me churchwarden,
which they would no more have done a month ago, when they considered me a down pin, than they--"

"Mercy upon us!" said I, "if fortune pours in upon you in this manner, who knows but that within
a year they may make you a justice of the peace?"

"Who knows, indeed!" said the landlord.  "Well, I will prove myself worthy of my good luck
by showing the grateful mind--not to those who would be kind to me now, but to those who were,
when the days were rather gloomy.  My customers shall have abundance of rough language, but
I'll knock any one down who says anything against the clergyman who lent me the fifty pounds,
or against the Church of England, of which he is parson and I am churchwarden.  I am also ready
to do anything in reason for him who paid me for the ale he drank, when I shouldn't have had
the heart to collar him for the money had he refused to pay; who never jeered or flouted me
like the rest of my customers when I was a down pin--and though he refused to fight cross for
me was never cross with me, but listened to all I had to say, and gave me all kinds of good
advice.  Now who do you think I mean by this last? why, who but yourself--who on earth but
yourself?  The parson is a good man and a great preacher, and I'll knock anybody down who says
to the contrary; and I mention him first, because why; he's a gentleman, and you a tinker.
But I am by no means sure you are not the best friend of the two; for I doubt, do you see,
whether I should have had the fifty pounds but for you.  You persuaded me to give up that silly
drink they call sherry, and drink ale; and what was it but drinking ale which gave me courage
to knock down that fellow Hunter--and knocking him down was, I verily believe, the turning
point of my disorder.  God don't love them who won't strike out for themselves; and as far
as I can calculate with respect to time, it was just the moment after I had knocked down Hunter,
that the parson consented to lend me the money, and everything began to grow civil to me. 
So, dash my buttons if I show the ungrateful mind to you!  I don't offer to knock anybody down
for you, because why--I dare say you can knock a body down yourself; but I'll offer something
more to the purpose; as my business is wonderfully on the increase, I shall want somebody to
help me in serving my customers, and keeping them in order.  If you choose to come and serve
for your board, and what they'll give you, give me your fist; or if you like ten shillings
a week better than their sixpences and ha'pence, only say so--though, to be open with you,
I believe you would make twice ten shillings out of them--the sneaking, fawning, curry-favouring
humbugs!"

"I am much obliged to you," said I, "for your handsome offer, which, however, I am obliged
to decline."

"Why so?" said the landlord.

"I am not fit for service," said I; "moreover, I am about to leave this part of the country."
As I spoke a horse neighed in the stable.  "What horse is that?" said I.

"It belongs to a cousin of mine, who put it into my hands yesterday in the hopes that I might
get rid of it for him, though he would no more have done so a week ago, when he considered
me a down pin, than he would have given the horse away.  Are you fond of horses?"

"Very much," said I.

"Then come and look at it."  He led me into the stable, where, in a stall, stood a noble-looking
animal.

"Dear me," said I, "I saw this horse at --- fair."

"Like enough," said the landlord; "he was there and was offered for seventy pounds, but didn't
find a bidder at any price.  What do you think of him?"

"He's a splendid creature."

"I am no judge of horses," said the landlord; "but I am told he's a first- rate trotter, good
leaper, and has some of the blood of Syntax.  What does all that signify?--the game is against
his master, who is a down pin, is thinking of emigrating, and wants money confoundedly.  He
asked seventy pounds at the fair; but, between ourselves, he would be glad to take fifty here."

"I almost wish," said I, "that I were a rich squire."

"You would buy him then," said the landlord.  Here he mused for some time, with a very profound
look.  "It would be a rum thing," said he, "if, some time or other, that horse should come
into your hands.  Didn't you hear how he neighed when you talked about leaving the country?
My granny was a wise woman, and was up to all kinds of signs and wonders, sounds and noises,
the interpretation of the language of birds and animals, crowing and lowing, neighing and braying.
If she had been here, she would have said at once that that horse was fated to carry you away.
On that point, however, I can say nothing, for under fifty pounds no one can have him.  Are
you taking that money out of your pocket to pay me for the ale?  That won't do; nothing to
pay; I invited you this time.  Now if you are going, you had best get into the road through
the yard-gate.  I won't trouble you to make your way through the kitchen and my fine-weather
company--confound them!"

CHAPTER XVIII

Mr. Petulengro's Device--The Leathern Purse--Consent to Purchase a Horse.

As I returned along the road I met Mr. Petulengro and one of his companions, who told me that
they were bound for the public-house; whereupon I informed Jasper how I had seen in the stable
the horse which we had admired at the fair.  "I shouldn't wonder if you buy that horse after
all, brother," said Mr. Petulengro.  With a smile at the absurdity of such a supposition, I
left him and his companion, and betook myself to the dingle.  In the evening I received a visit
from Mr. Petulengro, who forthwith commenced talking about the horse, which he had again seen,
the landlord having shown it to him on learning that he was a friend of mine. He told me that
the horse pleased him more than ever, he having examined his points with more accuracy than
he had an opportunity of doing on the first occasion, concluding by pressing me to buy him.
I begged him to desist from such foolish importunity, assuring him that I had never so much
money in all my life as would enable me to purchase the horse. Whilst this discourse was going
on, Mr. Petulengro and myself were standing together in the midst of the dingle.  Suddenly
he began to move round me--in a very singular manner, making strange motions with his hands,
and frightful contortions with his features, till I became alarmed, and asked him whether he
had not lost his senses?  Whereupon, ceasing his movements and contortions, he assured me that
he had not, but had merely been seized with a slight dizziness, and then once more returned
to the subject of the horse.  Feeling myself very angry, I told him that if he continued persecuting
me in that manner, I should be obliged to quarrel with him; adding, that I believed his only
motive for asking me to buy the animal was to insult my poverty.  "Pretty poverty," said he,
"with fifty pounds in your pocket; however, I have heard say that it is always the custom of
your rich people to talk of their poverty, more especially when they wish to avoid laying out
money." Surprised at his saying that I had fifty pounds in my pocket, I asked him what he meant;
whereupon he told me that he was very sure that I had fifty pounds in my pocket, offering to
lay me five shillings to that effect.  "Done!" said I; "I have scarcely more than the fifth
part of what you say."  "I know better, brother," said Mr. Petulengro; "if you only pull out
what you have in the pocket of your slop, I am sure you will have lost your wager."  Putting
my hand into the pocket, I felt something which I had never felt there before, and pulling
it out, perceived that it was a clumsy leathern purse, which I found on opening contained four
ten-pound-notes, and several pieces of gold.  "Didn't I tell you so, brother?" said Mr. Petulengro.
"Now, in the first place, please to pay me the five shillings you have lost."  "This is only
a foolish piece of pleasantry," said I; "you put it into my pocket whilst you were moving about
me, making faces like a distracted person.  Here, take your purse back."  "I?" said Mr. Petulengro,
"not I, indeed I don't think I am such a fool.  I have won my wager, so pay me the five shillings,
brother."  "Do drop this folly," said I, "and take your purse;" and I flung it on the ground.
"Brother," said Mr. Petulengro, "you were talking of quarrelling with me just now.  I tell
you now one thing, which is, that if you do not take back the purse I will quarrel with you;
and it shall be for good and all.  I'll drop your acquaintance, no longer call you my pal,
and not even say sarshan to you when I meet you by the roadside.  Hir mi diblis I never will."
I saw by Jasper's look and tone that he was in earnest, and, as I had really a regard for the
strange being, I scarcely knew what to do.  "Now, be persuaded, brother," said Mr. Petulengro,
taking up the purse, and handing it to me; "be persuaded; put the purse into your pocket, and
buy the horse." "Well," said I, "if I did so, would you acknowledge the horse to be yours,
and receive the money again as soon as I should be able to repay you?"

"I would, brother, I would," said he; "return me the money as soon as you please, provided
you buy the horse."  "What motive have you for wishing me to buy that horse?" said I.  "He's
to be sold for fifty pounds," said Jasper, "and is worth four times that sum; though, like
many a splendid bargain, he is now going a begging; buy him, and I'm confident that, in a little
time, a grand gentleman of your appearance may have anything he asks for him, and found a fortune
by his means.  Moreover, brother, I want to dispose of this fifty pounds in a safe manner.
If you don't take it, I shall fool it away in no time, perhaps at card-playing, for you saw
how I was cheated by those blackguard jockeys the other day--we gyptians don't know how to
take care of money: our best plan when we have got a handful of guineas is to make buttons
with them; but I have plenty of golden buttons, and don't wish to be troubled with more, so
you can do me no greater favour than vesting the money in this speculation, by which my mind
will be relieved of considerable care and trouble for some time at least."

Perceiving that I still hesitated, he said, "Perhaps, brother, you think I did not come honestly
by the money: by the honestest manner in the world, for it is the money I earnt by fighting
in the ring: I did not steal it, brother, nor did I get it by disposing of spavined donkeys,
or glandered ponies--nor is it, brother, the profits of my wife's witchcraft and dukkerin."

"But," said I, "you had better employ it in your traffic."  "I have plenty of money for my
traffic, independent of this capital," said Mr. Petulengro; "ay, brother, and enough besides
to back the husband of my wife's sister, Sylvester, against Slammocks of the Chong gav for
twenty pounds, which I am thinking of doing."

"But," said I, "after all, the horse may have found another purchaser by this time."  "Not
he," said Mr. Petulengro, "there is nobody in this neighbourhood to purchase a horse like that,
unless it be your lordship--so take the money, brother," and he thrust the purse into my hand.
Allowing myself to be persuaded, I kept possession of the purse. "Are you satisfied now?" said
I.  "By no means, brother," said Mr. Petulengro, "you will please to pay me the five shillings
which you lost to me."  "Why," said I, "the fifty pounds which I found in my pocket were not
mine, but put in by yourself."  "That's nothing to do with the matter, brother," said Mr. Petulengro,
"I betted you five shillings that you had fifty pounds in your pocket, which sum you had: I
did not say that they were your own, but merely that you had fifty pounds; you will therefore
pay me, brother, or I shall not consider you an honourable man."  Not wishing to have any dispute
about such a matter, I took five shillings out of my under pocket, and gave them to him.  Mr.
Petulengro took the money with great glee, observing--"These five shillings I will take to
the public-house forthwith, and spend in drinking with four of my brethren, and doing so will
give me an opportunity of telling the landlord that I have found a customer for his horse,
and that you are the man.  It will be as well to secure the horse as soon as possible; for
though the dook tells me that the horse is intended for you, I have now and then found that
the dook is, like myself, somewhat given to lying."

He then departed, and I remained alone in the dingle.  I thought at first that I had committed
a great piece of folly in consenting to purchase this horse; I might find no desirable purchaser
for him, until the money in my possession should be totally exhausted, and then I might be
compelled to sell him for half the price I had given for him, or be even glad to find a person
who would receive him at a gift; I should then remain sans horse, and indebted to Mr. Petulengro.
Nevertheless, it was possible that I might sell the horse very advantageously, and by so doing
obtain a fund sufficient to enable me to execute some grand enterprise or other.  My present
way of life afforded no prospect of support, whereas the purchase of the horse did afford a
possibility of bettering my condition, so, after all, had I not done right in consenting to
purchase the horse? the purchase was to be made with another person's property, it is true,
and I did not exactly like the idea of speculating with another person's property, but Mr.
Petulengro had thrust his money upon me, and if I lost his money, he could have no one but
himself to blame; so I persuaded myself that I had, upon the whole, done right, and having
come to that persuasion, I soon began to enjoy the idea of finding myself on horseback again,
and figured to myself all kinds of strange adventures which I should meet with on the roads
before the horse and I should part company.

CHAPTER XIX

Trying the Horse--The Feats of Tawno--Man with the Red Waist-coat--Disposal of Property.

I saw nothing more of Mr. Petulengro that evening--on the morrow, however, he came and informed
me that he had secured the horse for me, and that I was to go and pay for it at noon.  At the
hour appointed, therefore, I went with Mr. Petulengro and Tawno to the public, where, as before,
there was a crowd of company.  The landlord received us in the bar with marks of much satisfaction
and esteem, made us sit down, and treated us with some excellent mild draught ale.  "Who do
you think has been here this morning?" he said to me, "why, that fellow in black, who came
to carry me off to a house of Popish devotion, where I was to pass seven days and nights in
meditation, as I think he called it, before I publicly renounced the religion of my country.
I read him a pretty lecture, calling him several unhandsome names, and asking him what he meant
by attempting to seduce a church-warden of the Church of England.  I tell you what, he ran
some danger; for some of my customers, learning his errand, laid hold on him, and were about
to toss him in a blanket, and then duck him in the horse-pond.  I, however, interfered, and
said, 'that what he came about was between me and him, and that it was no business of theirs.'
To tell you the truth, I felt pity for the poor devil, more especially when I considered that
they merely sided against him because they thought him the weakest, and that they would have
wanted to serve me in the same manner had they considered me a down pin; so I rescued him from
their hands, told him not to be afraid, for that nobody should touch him, and offered to treat
him to some cold gin and water with a lump of sugar in it; and on his refusing, told him that
he had better make himself scarce, which he did, and I hope I shall never see him again.  So
I suppose you are come for the horse; mercy upon us! who would have thought you would have
become the purchaser?  The horse, however, seemed to know it by his neighing.  How did you
ever come by the money? however, that's no matter of mine.  I suppose you are strongly backed
by certain friends you have."

I informed the landlord that he was right in supposing that I came for the horse, but that,
before I paid for him, I should wish to prove his capabilities.  "With all my heart," said
the landlord.  "You shall mount him this moment."  Then going into the stable, he saddled and
bridled the horse, and presently brought him out before the door.  I mounted him, Mr. Petulengro
putting a heavy whip into my hand, and saying a few words to me in his own mysterious language.
"The horse wants no whip," said the landlord.  "Hold your tongue, daddy," said Mr. Petulengro.
"My pal knows quite well what to do with the whip, he's not going to beat the horse with it."
About four hundred yards from the house there was a hill, to the foot of which the road ran
almost on a perfect level; towards the foot of this hill I trotted the horse, who set off at
a long, swift pace, seemingly at the rate of about sixteen miles an hour.  On reaching the
foot of the hill, I wheeled the animal round, and trotted him towards the house--the horse
sped faster than before.  Ere he had advanced a hundred yards, I took off my hat, in obedience
to the advice which Mr. Petulengro had given me, in his own language, and holding it over the
horse's head commenced drumming on the crown with the knob of the whip; the horse gave a slight
start, but instantly recovering himself, continued his trot till he arrived at the door of
the public-house, amidst the acclamations of the company, who had all rushed out of the house
to be spectators of what was going on. "I see now what you wanted the whip for," said the landlord,
"and sure enough, that drumming on your hat was no bad way of learning whether the horse was
quiet or not.  Well, did you ever see a more quiet horse, or a better trotter?"  "My cob shall
trot against him," said a fellow, dressed in velveteen, mounted on a low powerful-looking animal.
"My cob shall trot against him to the hill and back again--come on!"  We both started; the
cob kept up gallantly against the horse for about half way to the hill, when he began to lose
ground; at the foot of the hill he was about fifteen yards behind.  Whereupon I turned slowly
and waited for him.  We then set off towards the house, but now the cob had no chance, being
at least twenty yards behind when I reached the door.  This running of the horse, the wild
uncouth forms around me, and the ale and beer which were being guzzled from pots and flagons,
put me wonderfully in mind of the ancient horse-races of the heathen north.  I almost imagined
myself Gunnar of Hlitharend at the race of--

"Are you satisfied?" said the landlord.  "Didn't you tell me that he could leap?" I demanded.
"I am told he can," said the landlord; "but I can't consent that he should be tried in that
way, as he might be damaged."  "That's right!" said Mr. Petulengro, "don't trust my pal to
leap that horse, he'll merely fling him down, and break his neck and his own.  There's a better
man than he close by; let him get on his back and leap him."  "You mean yourself, I suppose,"
said the landlord.  "Well, I call that talking modestly, and nothing becomes a young man more
than modesty."  "It a'n't I, daddy," said Mr. Petulengro.  "Here's the man," said he, pointing
to Tawno.  "Here's the horse-leaper of the world!"  "You mean the horse-back breaker," said
the landlord.  "That big fellow would break down my cousin's horse."  "Why, he weighs only
sixteen stone," said Mr. Petulengro.  "And his sixteen stone, with his way of handling a horse,
does not press so much as any other one's thirteen.  Only let him get on the horse's back,
and you'll see what he can do!"  "No," said the landlord, "it won't do." Whereupon Mr. Petulengro
became very much excited; and pulling out a handful of money, said, "I'll tell you what, I'll
forfeit these guineas, if my black pal there does the horse any kind of damage; duck me in
the horse-pond if I don't."  "Well," said the landlord, "for the sport of the thing I consent,
so let your white pal get down, and our black pal mount as soon as he pleases."  I felt rather
mortified at Mr. Petulengro's interference; and showed no disposition to quit my seat; whereupon
he came up to me and said, "Now, brother, do get out of the saddle--you are no bad hand at
trotting, I am willing to acknowledge that; but at leaping a horse there is no one like Tawno.
Let every dog be praised for his own gift.  You have been showing off in your line for the
last half-hour; now do give Tawno a chance of exhibiting a little; poor fellow, he hasn't often
a chance of exhibiting, as his wife keeps him so much out of sight."  Not wishing to appear
desirous of engrossing the public attention, and feeling rather desirous to see how Tawno,
of whose exploits in leaping horses I had frequently heard, would acquit himself in the affair,
I at length dismounted, and Tawno, at a bound, leaped into the saddle, where he really looked
like Gunnar of Hlitharend, save and except the complexion of Gunnar was florid, whereas that
of Tawno was of nearly Mulatto darkness; and that all Tawno's features were cast in the Grecian
model, whereas Gunnar had a snub nose. "There's a leaping-bar behind the house," said the landlord.
"Leaping- bar!" said Mr. Petulengro, scornfully.  "Do you think my black pal ever rides at
a leaping-bar?  No more than a windle-straw.  Leap over that meadow-wall, Tawno."  Just past
the house, in the direction in which I had been trotting, was a wall about four feet high,
beyond which was a small meadow.  Tawno rode the horse gently up to the wall, permitted him
to look over, then backed him for about ten yards, and pressing his calves against the horse's
sides, he loosed the rein, and the horse launching forward, took the leap in gallant style.
"Well done, man and horse!" said Mr. Petulengro, "now come back, Tawno."  The leap from the
side of the meadow was, however, somewhat higher; and the horse, when pushed at it, at first
turned away; whereupon Tawno backed him to a greater distance, pushed the horse to a full gallop,
giving a wild cry; whereupon the horse again took the wall, slightly grazing one of his legs
against it.  "A near thing," said the landlord; "but a good leap.  Now, no more leaping, so
long as I have control over the animal."  The horse was then led back to the stable; and the
landlord, myself and companions going into the bar, I paid down the money for the horse.

Scarcely was the bargain concluded, when two or three of the company began to envy me the possession
of the horse, and forcing their way into the bar, with much noise and clamour, said that the
horse had been sold too cheap.  One fellow, in particular, with a red waistcoat, the son of
a wealthy farmer, said that if he had but known that the horse had been so good a one, he would
have bought it at the first price asked for it, which he was now willing to pay, that is to-morrow,
supposing--"supposing your father will let you have the money," said the landlord, "which,
after all, might not be the case; but, however that may be, it is too late now.  I think myself
the horse has been sold for too little money, but if so all the better for the young man, who
came forward when no other body did with his money in his hand.  There, take yourselves out
of my bar," he said to the fellows; "and a pretty scoundrel you," said he to the man of the
red waistcoat, "to say the horse has been sold too cheap; why, it was only yesterday you said
he was good for nothing, and were passing all kinds of jokes at him.  Take yourself out of
my bar, I say, you and all of you," and he turned the fellows out.  I then asked the landlord
whether he would permit the horse to remain in the stable for a short time, provided I paid
for his entertainment; and on his willingly consenting, I treated my friends with ale, and
then returned with them to the encampment.

That evening I informed Mr. Petulengro and his party that on the morrow I intended to mount
my horse, and leave that part of the country in quest of adventures; inquiring of Jasper where,
in the event of my selling the horse advantageously, I might meet with him, and repay the money
I had borrowed of him; whereupon Mr. Petulengro informed me that in about ten weeks I might
find him at a certain place at the Chong gav.  I then stated that as I could not well carry
with me the property which I possessed in the dingle, which after all was of no considerable
value, I had resolved to bestow the said property, namely, the pony, tent, tinker- tools, etc.,
on Ursula and her husband, partly because they were poor, and partly on account of the great
kindness which I bore to Ursula, from whom I had, on various occasions, experienced all manner
of civility, particularly in regard to crabbed words.  On hearing this intelligence, Ursula
returned many thanks to her gentle brother, as she called me, and Sylvester was so overjoyed
that, casting aside his usual phlegm, he said I was the best friend he had ever had in the
world, and in testimony of his gratitude swore that he would permit his wife to give me a choomer
in the presence of the whole company, which offer, however, met with a very mortifying reception,
the company frowning disapprobation, Ursula protesting against anything of the kind, and I
myself showing no forwardness to avail myself of it, having inherited from nature a considerable
fund of modesty, to which was added no slight store acquired in the course of my Irish education.

CHAPTER XX

Farewell to the Romans--The Landlord and His Niece--Set Out as a Traveller.

On reaching the plain above, I found my Romany friends breakfasting, and on being asked by
Mr. Petulengro to join them, I accepted the invitation. No sooner was breakfast over than I
informed Ursula and her husband that they would find the property, which I had promised them,
in the dingle, commending the little pony Ambrol to their best care.  I took leave of the whole
company, which was itself about to break up camp and to depart in the direction of London,
and made the best of my way to the public- house.  I had a small bundle in my hand, and was
dressed in the same manner as when I departed from London, having left my waggoner's slop with
the other effects in the dingle.  On arriving at the public-house, I informed the landlord
that I was come for my horse, inquiring, at the same time, whether he could not accommodate
me with a bridle and saddle. He told me that the bridle and saddle, with which I had ridden
the horse on the preceding day, were at my service for a trifle; that he had received them
some time since in payment for a debt, and that he had himself no use for them.  The leathers
of the bridle were rather shabby, and the bit rusty, and the saddle was old fashioned; but
I was happy to purchase them for seven shillings, more especially as the landlord added a small
valise, which he said could be strapped to the saddle, and which I should find very convenient
for carrying my things in.  I then proceeded to the stable, told the horse we were bound on
an expedition, and giving him a feed of corn, left him to discuss it, and returned to the bar-room
to have a little farewell chat with the landlord, and at the same time to drink with him a
farewell glass of ale.  Whilst we were talking and drinking, the niece came and joined us:
she was a decent, sensible young woman, who appeared to take a great interest in her uncle,
whom she regarded with a singular mixture of pride and, disapprobation--pride for the renown
which he had acquired by his feats of old, and disapprobation for his late imprudences.  She
said that she hoped that his misfortunes would be a warning to him to turn more to his God
than he had hitherto done, and to give up cock-fighting and other low- life practices.  To
which the landlord replied, that with respect to cock- fighting he intended to give it up entirely,
being determined no longer to risk his capital upon birds, and with respect to his religious
duties, he should attend the church of which he was churchwarden at least once a quarter, adding,
however, that he did not intend to become either canter or driveller, neither of which characters
would befit a publican surrounded by such customers as he was, and that to the last day of
his life he hoped to be able to make use of his fists.  After a stay of about two hours I settled
accounts, and having bridled and saddled my horse, and strapped on my valise, I mounted, shook
hands with the landlord and his niece, and departed, notwithstanding that they both entreated
me to tarry until the evening, it being then the heat of the day.

CHAPTER XXI

An Adventure on the Road--The Six Flint Stone--A Rural Scene--Mead--The Old Man and His Bees.

I bent my course in the direction of the north, more induced by chance than any particular
motive; all quarters of the world having about equal attractions for me.  I was in high spirits
at finding myself once more on horse-back, and trotted gaily on, until the heat of the weather
induced me to slacken my pace, more out of pity for my horse than because I felt any particular
inconvenience from it--heat and cold being then, and still, matters of great indifference to
me.  What I thought of I scarcely know, save and except that I have a glimmering recollection
that I felt some desire to meet with one of those adventures which upon the roads of England
are generally as plentiful as blackberries in autumn; and Fortune, who has generally been ready
to gratify my inclinations, provided it cost her very little by so doing, was not slow in furnishing
me with an adventure, perhaps as characteristic of the English roads as anything which could
have happened.

I might have travelled about six miles amongst cross roads and lanes, when suddenly I found
myself upon a broad and very dusty road which seemed to lead due north.  As I wended along
this I saw a man upon a donkey riding towards me.  The man was commonly dressed, with a broad
felt hat on his head, and a kind of satchel on his back; he seemed to be in a mighty hurry,
and was every now and then belabouring the donkey with a cudgel.  The donkey, however, which
was a fine large creature of the silver-grey species, did not appear to sympathize at all with
its rider in his desire to get on, but kept its head turned back as much as possible, moving
from one side of the road to the other, and not making much forward way.  As I passed, being
naturally of a very polite disposition, I gave the man the sele of the day, asking him, at
the same time, why he beat the donkey; whereupon the fellow eyeing me askance, told me to mind
my own business, with the addition of something which I need not repeat.  I had not proceeded
a furlong before I saw seated on the dust by the wayside, close by a heap of stones, and with
several flints before him, a respectable-looking old man, with a straw hat and a white smock,
who was weeping bitterly.

"What are you crying for, father?" said I.  "Have you come to any hurt?" "Hurt enough," sobbed
the old man, "I have just been tricked out of the best ass in England by a villain, who gave
me nothing but these trash in return," pointing to the stones before him.  "I really scarcely
understand you," said I, "I wish you would explain yourself more clearly."  "I was riding on
my ass from market," said the old man, "when I met here a fellow with a sack on his back, who,
after staring at the ass and me a moment or two, asked me if I would sell her.  I told him
that I could not think of selling her, as she was very useful to me, and though an animal,
my true companion, whom I loved as much as if she were my wife and daughter.  I then attempted
to pass on, but the fellow stood before me, begging me to sell her, saying that he would give
me anything for her; well, seeing that he persisted, I said at last that if I sold her, I must
have six pounds for her, and I said so to get rid of him, for I saw that he was a shabby fellow,
who had probably not six shillings in the world; but I had better have held my tongue," said
the old man, crying more bitterly than before, "for the words were scarcely out of my mouth,
when he said he would give me what I asked, and taking the sack from his back, he pulled out
a steelyard, and going to the heap of stones there, he took up several of them and weighed
them, then flinging them down before me, he said, 'There are six pounds, neighbour; now, get
off the ass, and hand her over to me.'  Well, I sat like one dumbfoundered for a time, till
at last I asked him what he meant?  'What do I mean?' said he, 'you old rascal, why, I mean
to claim my purchase,' and then he swore so awfully, that scarcely knowing what I did I got
down, and he jumped on the animal and rode off as fast as he could."  "I suppose he was the
fellow," said I, "whom I just now met upon a fine gray ass, which he was beating with a cudgel."
"I dare say he was," said the old man, "I saw him beating her as he rode away, and I thought
I should have died." "I never heard such a story," said I; "well, do you mean to submit to
such a piece of roguery quietly?"  "Oh, dear," said the old man, "what can I do?  I am seventy-nine
years of age; I am bad on my feet, and dar'n't go after him."--"Shall I go?" said I; "the fellow
is a thief, and any one has a right to stop him."  "Oh, if you could but bring her again to
me," said the old man, "I would bless you till my dying day; but have a care; I don't know
but after all the law may say that she is his lawful purchase.  I asked six pounds for her,
and he gave me six pounds."  "Six flints, you mean," said I, "no, no, the law is not quite
so bad as that either; I know something about her, and am sure that she will never sanction
such a quibble.  At all events, I'll ride after the fellow." Thereupon turning my horse round,
I put him to his very best trot; I rode nearly a mile without obtaining a glimpse of the fellow,
and was becoming apprehensive that he had escaped me by turning down some by-path, two or three
of which I had passed.  Suddenly, however, on the road making a slight turning, I perceived
him right before me, moving at a tolerably swift pace, having by this time probably overcome
the resistance of the animal.  Putting my horse to a full gallop, I shouted at the top of my
voice, "Get off that donkey, you rascal, and give her up to me, or I'll ride you down."  The
fellow hearing the thunder of the horse's hoofs behind him, drew up on one side of the road.
"What do you want?" said he, as I stopped my charger, now almost covered with sweat and foam
close beside him.  "Do you want to rob me?"  "To rob you?" said I.  "No! but to take from you
that ass, of which you have just robbed its owner."  "I have robbed no man," said the fellow;
"I just now purchased it fairly of its master, and the law will give it to me; he asked six
pounds for it, and I gave him six pounds."  "Six stones, you mean, you rascal," said I; "get
down, or my horse shall be upon you in a moment;" then with a motion of my reins, I caused
the horse to rear, pressing his sides with my heels as if I intended to make him leap.  "Stop,"
said the man, "I'll get down, and then try if I can't serve you out."  He then got down, and
confronted me with his cudgel; he was a horrible-looking fellow, and seemed prepared for anything.
Scarcely, however, had he dismounted, when the donkey jerked the bridle out of his hand, and
probably in revenge for the usage she had received, gave him a pair of tremendous kicks on
the hip with her hinder legs, which overturned him, and then scampered down the road the way
she had come.  "Pretty treatment this," said the fellow, getting up without his cudgel, and
holding his hand to his side, "I wish I may not be lamed for life."  "And if you be," said
I, "it will merely serve you right, you rascal, for trying to cheat a poor old man out of his
property by quibbling at words."  "Rascal!" said the fellow, "you lie, I am no rascal; and
as for quibbling with words--suppose I did!  What then?  All the first people does it!  The
newspapers does it! the gentlefolks that calls themselves the guides of the popular mind does
it!  I'm no ignoramus.  I read the newspapers, and knows what's what."  "You read them to some
purpose," said I.  "Well, if you are lamed for life, and unfitted for any active line--turn
newspaper editor; I should say you are perfectly qualified, and this day's adventure may be
the foundation of your fortune," thereupon I turned round and rode off.  The fellow followed
me with a torrent of abuse.  "Confound you," said he--yet that was not the expression either--"I
know you; you are one of the horse-patrol come down into the country on leave to see your relations.
Confound you, you and the like of you have knocked my business on the head near Lunnon, and
I suppose we shall have you shortly in the country."  "To the newspaper office," said I, "and
fabricate falsehoods out of flint stones;" then touching the horse with my heels, I trotted
off, and coming to the place where I had seen the old man, I found him there, risen from the
ground, and embracing his ass.

I told him that I was travelling down the road, and said, that if his way lay in the same direction
as mine he could do no better than accompany me for some distance, lest the fellow who, for
aught I knew, might be hovering nigh, might catch him alone, and again get his ass from him.
After thanking me for my offer, which he said he would accept, he got upon his ass, and we
proceeded together down the road.  My new acquaintance said very little of his own accord;
and when I asked him a question, answered rather incoherently.  I heard him every now and then
say, "Villain!" to himself, after which he would pat the donkey's neck, from which circumstance
I concluded that his mind was occupied with his late adventure.  After travelling about two
miles, we reached a place where a drift-way on the right led from the great road; here my companion
stopped, and on my asking him whether he was going any farther, he told me that the path to
the right was the way to his home.

I was bidding him farewell, when he hemmed once or twice, and said, that as he did not live
far off, he hoped that I would go with him and taste some of his mead.  As I had never tasted
mead, of which I had frequently read in the compositions of the Welsh bards, and, moreover,
felt rather thirsty from the heat of the day, I told him that I should have great pleasure
in attending him.  Whereupon, turning off together, we proceeded about half a mile, sometimes
between stone walls, and at other times hedges, till we reached a small hamlet, through which
we passed, and presently came to a very pretty cottage, delightfully situated within a garden,
surrounded by a hedge of woodbines.  Opening a gate at one corner of the garden he led the
way to a large shed, which stood partly behind the cottage, which he said was his stable; thereupon
he dismounted and led his donkey into the shed, which was without stalls, but had a long rack
and manger.  On one side he tied his donkey, after taking off her caparisons, and I followed
his example, tying my horse at the other side with a rope halter which he gave me; he then
asked me to come in and taste his mead, but I told him that I must attend to the comfort of
my horse first, and forthwith, taking a wisp of straw, rubbed him carefully down.  Then taking
a pailful of clear water which stood in the shed, I allowed the horse to drink about half a
pint; and then turning to the old man, who all the time had stood by looking at my proceedings,
I asked him whether he had any oats?  "I have all kinds of grain," he replied; and, going out,
he presently returned with two measures, one a large and the other a small one, both filled
with oats, mixed with a few beans, and handing the large one to me for the horse, he emptied
the other before the donkey, who, before she began to despatch it, turned her nose to her master's
face, and fairly kissed him.  Having given my horse his portion, I told the old man that I
was ready to taste his mead as soon as he pleased, whereupon he ushered me into his cottage,
where, making me sit down by a deal table in a neatly sanded kitchen, he produced from an old-
fashioned closet a bottle, holding about a quart, and a couple of cups, which might each contain
about half a pint, then opening the bottle and filling the cups with a brown-coloured liquor,
he handed one to me, and taking a seat opposite to me, he lifted the other, nodded, and saying
to me--"Health and welcome," placed it to his lips and drank.

"Health and thanks," I replied; and being very thirsty, emptied my cup at a draught; I had
scarcely done so, however, when I half repented.  The mead was deliciously sweet and mellow,
but appeared strong as brandy; my eyes reeled in my head, and my brain became slightly dizzy.
"Mead is a strong drink," said the old man, as he looked at me, with a half smile on his countenance.
"This is at any rate," said I, "so strong, indeed, that I would not drink another cup for any
consideration."  "And I would not ask you," said the old man; "for, if you did, you would most
probably be stupid all day, and wake the next morning with a headache.  Mead is a good drink,
but woundily strong, especially to those who be not used to it, as I suppose you are not."
"Where do you get it?" said I.  "I make it myself," said the old man, "from the honey which
my bees make."  "Have you many bees?" I inquired.  "A great many," said the old man.  "And
do you keep them," said I, "for the sake of making mead with their honey?" "I keep them," he
replied, "partly because I am fond of them, and partly for what they bring me in; they make
me a great deal of honey, some of which I sell, and with a little I make some mead to warm
my poor heart with, or occasionally to treat a friend with like yourself."  "And do you support
yourself entirely by means of your bees?"  "No," said the old man; "I have a little bit of
ground behind my house, which is my principal means of support."  "And do you live alone?"
"Yes," said he; "with the exception of the bees and the donkey, I live quite alone."  "And
have you always lived alone?"  The old man emptied his cup, and his heart being warmed with
the mead, he told his history, which was simplicity itself.  His father was a small yeoman,
who, at his death, had left him, his only child, the cottage, with a small piece of ground
behind it, and on this little property he had lived ever since.  About the age of twenty- five
he had married an industrious young woman, by whom he had one daughter, who died before reaching
years of womanhood.  His wife, however, had survived her daughter many years, and had been
a great comfort to him, assisting him in his rural occupations; but, about four years before
the present period, he had lost her, since which time he had lived alone, making himself as
comfortable as he could; cultivating his ground, with the help of a lad from the neighbouring
village, attending to his bees, and occasionally riding his donkey to market, and hearing the
word of God, which he said he was sorry he could not read, twice a week regularly at the parish
church.  Such was the old man's tale.

When he had finished speaking, he led me behind his house, and showed me his little domain.
It consisted of about two acres in admirable cultivation; a small portion of it formed a kitchen
garden, while the rest was sown with four kinds of grain, wheat, barley, peas, and beans. The
air was full of ambrosial sweets, resembling those proceeding from an orange grove; a place
which though I had never seen at that time, I since have.  In the garden was the habitation
of the bees, a long box, supported upon three oaken stumps.  It was full of small round glass
windows, and appeared to be divided into a great many compartments, much resembling drawers
placed sideways.  He told me that, as one compartment was filled, the bees left it for another;
so that, whenever he wanted honey, he could procure some without injury to the insects.  Through
the little round windows I could see several of the bees at work; hundreds were going in and
out of the doors; hundreds were buzzing about on the flowers, the woodbines, and beans.  As
I looked around on the well-cultivated field, the garden, and the bees, I thought I had never
before seen so rural and peaceful a scene.

When we returned to the cottage we again sat down, and I asked the old man whether he was not
afraid to live alone.  He told me that he was not, for that, upon the whole, his neighbours
were very kind to him.  I mentioned the fellow who had swindled him of his donkey upon the
road. "That was no neighbour of mine," said the old man, "and, perhaps, I shall never see him
again, or his like."  "It's a dreadful thing," said I, "to have no other resource, when injured,
than to shed tears on the road." "It is so," said the old man; "but God saw the tears of the
old, and sent a helper."  "Why did you not help yourself?" said I.  "Instead of getting off
your ass, why did you not punch at the fellow, or at any rate use dreadful language, call him
villain, and shout robbery?"  "Punch!" said the old man, "shout! what, with these hands, and
this voice--Lord, how you run on!  I am old, young chap, I am old!"  "Well," said I, "it is
a shameful thing to cry even when old."  "You think so now," said the old man, "because you
are young and strong; perhaps when you are as old as I, you will not be ashamed to cry."

Upon the whole I was rather pleased with the old man, and much with all about him.  As evening
drew nigh, I told him that I must proceed on my journey; whereupon he invited me to tarry with
him during the night, telling me that he had a nice room and bed above at my service.  I, however,
declined; and bidding him farewell, mounted my horse, and departed.  Regaining the road, I
proceeded once more in the direction of the north; and, after a few hours, coming to a comfortable
public-house, I stopped, and put up for the night.

CHAPTER XXII

The Singular Noise--Sleeping in a Meadow--The Book--Cure for Wakefulness--Literary Tea Party--Poor
Byron.

I did not awake till rather late the next morning; and when I did, I felt considerable drowsiness,
with a slight headache, which I was uncharitable enough to attribute to the mead which I had
drunk on the preceding day. After feeding my horse, and breakfasting, I proceeded on my wanderings.
Nothing occurred worthy of relating till mid-day was considerably past, when I came to a pleasant
valley, between two gentle hills.  I had dismounted, in order to ease my horse, and was leading
him along by the bridle, when, on my right, behind a bank in which some umbrageous ashes were
growing, heard a singular noise.  I stopped short and listened, and presently said to myself,
"Surely this is snoring, perhaps that of a hedgehog."  On further consideration, however, I
was convinced that the noise which I heard, and which certainly seemed to be snoring, could
not possibly proceed from the nostrils of so small an animal, but must rather come from those
of a giant, so loud and sonorous was it.  About two or three yards farther was a gate, partly
open, to which I went, and peeping into the field, saw a man lying on some rich grass, under
the shade of one of the ashes; he was snoring away at a great rate.  Impelled by curiosity,
I fastened the bridle of my horse to the gate, and went up to the man.  He was a genteelly-dressed
individual; rather corpulent, with dark features, and seemingly about forty-five.  He lay on
his back, his hat slightly over his brow, and at his right hand lay an open book.  So strenuously
did he snore that the wind from his nostrils agitated, perceptibly, a fine cambric frill which
he wore at his bosom.  I gazed upon him for some time, expecting that he might awake; but he
did not, but kept on snoring, his breast heaving convulsively.  At last, the noise he made
became so terrible, that I felt alarmed for his safety, imagining that a fit might seize him,
and he lose his life while fast asleep.  I therefore exclaimed, "Sir, sir, awake! you sleep
over-much."  But my voice failed to rouse him, and he continued snoring as before; whereupon
I touched him slightly with my riding wand, but failing to wake him, I touched him again more
vigorously; whereupon he opened his eyes, and, probably imagining himself in a dream, closed
them again.  But I was determined to arouse him, and cried as loud as I could, "Sir, sir, pray
sleep no more!"  He heard what I said, opened his eyes again, stared at me with a look of some
consciousness, and, half raising himself upon his elbows, asked me what was the matter.  "I
beg your pardon," said I, "but I took the liberty of awaking you, because you appeared to be
much disturbed in your sleep--I was fearful, too, that you might catch a fever from sleeping
under a tree."  "I run no risk," said the man, "I often come and sleep here; and as for being
disturbed in my sleep, I felt very comfortable; I wish you had not awoke me."  "Well," said
I, "I beg your pardon once more.  I assure you that what I did was with the best intention."
"Oh! pray make no further apology," said the individual, "I make no doubt that what you did
was done kindly; but there's an old proverb, to the effect, 'that you should let sleeping dogs
lie,'" he added with a smile.  Then, getting up, and stretching himself with a yawn, he took
up his book and said, "I have slept quite long enough, and it's quite time for me to be going
home."  "Excuse my curiosity," said I, "if I inquire what may induce you to come and sleep
in this meadow?"  "To tell you the truth," answered he, "I am a bad sleeper."  "Pray pardon
me," said I, "if I tell you that I never saw one sleep more heartily." "If I did so," said
the individual, "I am beholden to this meadow and this book; but I am talking riddles, and
will explain myself.  I am the owner of a very pretty property, of which this valley forms
part.  Some years ago, however, up started a person who said the property was his; a lawsuit
ensued, and I was on the brink of losing my all, when, most unexpectedly, the suit was determined
in my favour.  Owing, however, to the anxiety to which my mind had been subjected for several
years, my nerves had become terribly shaken; and no sooner was the trial terminated than sleep
forsook my pillow.  I sometimes passed nights without closing an eye; I took opiates, but they
rather increased than alleviated my malady.  About three weeks ago a friend of mine put this
book into my hand, and advised me to take it every day to some pleasant part of my estate,
and try and read a page or two, assuring me, if I did, that I should infallibly fall asleep.
I took his advice, and selecting this place, which I considered the pleasantest part of my
property, I came, and lying down, commenced reading the book, and before finishing a page was
in a dead slumber.  Every day since then I have repeated the experiment, and every time with
equal success.  I am a single man, without any children; and yesterday I made my will, in which,
in the event of my friend's surviving me, I have left him all my fortune, in gratitude for
his having procured for me the most invaluable of all blessings--sleep."

"Dear me," said I, "how very extraordinary!  Do you think that your going to sleep is caused
by the meadow or the book?"  "I suppose by both," said my new acquaintance, "acting in co-operation."
"It may be so," said I; "the magic influence does certainly not proceed from the meadow alone;
for since I have been here, I have not felt the slightest inclination to sleep.  Does the book
consist of prose or poetry?"  "It consists of poetry," said the individual.  "Not Byron's?"
said I.  "Byron's!" repeated the individual, with a smile of contempt; "no, no; there is nothing
narcotic in Byron's poetry.  I don't like it.  I used to read it, but it thrilled, agitated,
and kept me awake.  No; this is not Byron's poetry, but the inimitable ---'s"--mentioning a
name which I had never heard till then.  "Will you permit me to look at it?" said I.  "With
pleasure," he answered, politely handing me the book.  I took the volume, and glanced over
the contents.  It was written in blank verse, and appeared to abound in descriptions of scenery;
there was much mention of mountains, valleys, streams, and waterfalls, harebells and daffodils.
These descriptions were interspersed with dialogues, which, though they proceeded from the
mouths of pedlars and rustics, were of the most edifying description; mostly on subjects moral
or metaphysical, and couched in the most gentlemanly and unexceptionable language, without
the slightest mixture of vulgarity, coarseness, or pie-bald grammar.  Such appeared to me to
be the contents of the book; but before I could form a very clear idea of them, I found myself
nodding, and a surprising desire to sleep coming over me.  Rousing myself, however, by a strong
effort, I closed the book, and, returning it to the owner, inquired of him, "Whether he had
any motive in coming and lying down in the meadow, besides the wish of enjoying sleep?"  "None
whatever," he replied; "indeed, I should be very glad not to be compelled to do so, always
provided I could enjoy the blessing of sleep; for by lying down under trees, I may possibly
catch the rheumatism, or be stung by serpents; and, moreover, in the rainy season and winter
the thing will be impossible, unless I erect a tent, which will possibly destroy the charm."
"Well," said I, "you need give yourself no further trouble about coming here, as I am fully
convinced that with this book in your hand, you may go to sleep anywhere, as your friend was
doubtless aware, though he wished to interest your imagination for a time by persuading you
to lie abroad; therefore, in future, whenever you feel disposed to sleep, try to read the book,
and you will be sound asleep in a minute; the narcotic influence lies in the book, and not
in the field."  "I will follow your advice," said the individual; "and this very night take
it with me to bed; though I hope in time to be able to sleep without it, my nerves being already
much quieted from the slumbers I have enjoyed in this field."  He then moved towards the gate,
where we parted; he going one way, and I and my horse the other.

More than twenty years subsequent to this period, after much wandering about the world, returning
to my native country, I was invited to a literary tea-party, where, the discourse turning upon
poetry, I, in order to show that I was not more ignorant than my neighbours, began to talk
about Byron, for whose writings I really entertained considerable admiration, though I had
no particular esteem for the man himself.  At first, I received no answer to what I said--the
company merely surveying me with a kind of sleepy stare.  At length a lady, about the age of
forty, with a large wart on her face, observed, in a drawling tone, "That she had not read
Byron--at least, since her girlhood--and then only a few passages; but that the impression
on her mind was, that his writings were of a highly objectionable character."  "I also read
a little of him in my boyhood," said a gentleman about sixty, but who evidently, from his dress
and demeanour, wished to appear about thirty, "but I highly disapproved of him; for, notwithstanding
he was a nobleman, he is frequently very coarse, and very fond of raising emotion.  Now emotion
is what I dislike;" drawling out the last syllable of the word dislike.  "There is only one
poet for me--the divine--" and then he mentioned a name which I had only once heard, and afterwards
quite forgotten; the same mentioned by the snorer in the field.  "Ah! there is no one like
him!" murmured some more of the company; "the poet of nature--of nature without its vulgarity."
I wished very much to ask these people whether they were ever bad sleepers, and whether they
had read the poet, so called, from a desire of being set to sleep.  Within a few days, however,
I learnt that it had of late become very fashionable and genteel to appear half asleep, and
that one could exhibit no better mark of superfine breeding than by occasionally in company
setting one's rhomal organ in action.  I then ceased to wonder at the popularity, which I found
nearly universal, of --- 's poetry; for, certainly in order to make one's self appear sleepy
in company, or occasionally to induce sleep, nothing could be more efficacious than a slight
prelection of his poems.  So poor Byron, with his fire and emotion--to say nothing of his mouthings
and coxcombry--was dethroned, as I prophesied he would be more than twenty years before, on
the day of his funeral, though I had little idea that his humiliation would have been brought
about by one, whose sole strength consists in setting people to sleep.  Well, all things are
doomed to terminate in sleep.  Before that termination, however, I will venture to prophesy
that people will become a little more awake--snoring and yawning be a little less in fashion--and
poor Byron be once more reinstated on his throne, though his rival will always stand a good
chance of being worshipped by those whose ruined nerves are insensible to the narcotic powers
of opium and morphine.

CHAPTER XXIII

Drivers and Front Outside Passengers--Fatigue of Body and Mind--Unexpected Greeting--My Inn--The
Governor--Engagement.

I continued my journey, passing through one or two villages.  The day was exceedingly hot,
and the roads dusty.  In order to cause my horse as little fatigue as possible, and not to
chafe his back, I led him by the bridle, my doing which brought upon me a shower of remarks,
jests, and would-be witticisms from the drivers and front outside passengers of sundry stage-coaches
which passed me in one direction or the other.  In this way I proceeded till considerably past
noon, when I felt myself very fatigued, and my horse appeared no less so; and it is probable
that the lazy and listless manner in which we were moving on, tired us both much more effectually
than hurrying along at a swift trot would have done, for I have observed that when the energies
of the body are not exerted a languor frequently comes over it.  At length arriving at a very
large building with an archway, near the entrance of a town, I sat down on what appeared to
be a stepping-block, and presently experienced a great depression of spirits.  I began to ask
myself whither I was going, and what I should do with myself and the horse which I held by
the bridle?  It appeared to me that I was alone in the world with the poor animal, who looked
for support to me, who knew not how to support myself.

As I sat in this state of mind, I suddenly felt some one clap me on the shoulder, and heard
a voice say, "Ha! comrade of the dingle, what chance has brought you into these parts?"  I
turned round, and beheld a man in the dress of a postillion, whom I instantly recognized as
he to whom I had rendered assistance on the night of the storm.

"Ah!" said I, "is it you?  I am glad to see you, for I was feeling very lonely and melancholy."

"Lonely and melancholy," he replied, "how is that? how can any one be lonely and melancholy
with such a noble horse as that you hold by the bridle?"

"The horse," said I, "is one cause of my melancholy, for I know not in the world what to do
with it."

"It is your own?"

"Yes," said I, "I may call it my own, though I borrowed the money to purchase it."

"Well, why don't you sell it?"

"It is not always easy to find a purchaser for a horse like this," said I; "can you recommend
me one?"

"I?  Why no, not exactly; but you'll find a purchaser shortly--pooh! if you have no other cause
for disquiet than that horse, cheer up, man, don't be cast down.  Have you nothing else on
your mind?  By the bye, what's become of the young woman you were keeping company with in that
queer lodging place of yours?"

"She has left me," said I.

"You quarrelled, I suppose?"

"No," said I, "we did not exactly quarrel, but we are parted."

"Well," replied he, "but you will soon come together again."

"No," said I, "we are parted for ever."

"For ever!  Pooh! you little know how people sometimes come together again who think they are
parted for ever.  Here's something on that point relating to myself.  You remember, when I
told you my story in that dingle of yours, that I mentioned a young woman, my fellow-servant
when I lived with the English family in Mumbo Jumbo's town, and how she and I, when our foolish
governors were thinking of changing their religion, agreed to stand by each other, and be true
to old Church of England, and to give our governors warning, provided they tried to make us
renegades. Well, she and I parted soon after that, and never to meet again, yet we met the
other day in the fields, for she lately came to live with a great family not far from here,
and we have since agreed to marry, to take a little farm, for we have both a trifle of money,
and live together till 'death us do part.'  So much for parting for ever!  But what do I mean
by keeping you broiling in the sun with your horse's bridle in your hand, and you on my own
ground?  Do you know where you are?  Why, that great house is my inn, that is, it's my master's,
the best fellow in ---.  Come along, you and your horse both will find a welcome at my inn."

Thereupon he led the way into a large court in which there were coaches, chaises, and a great
many people; taking my horse from me, he led it into a nice cool stall, and fastened it to
the rack--he then conducted me into a postillion's keeping-room, which at that time chanced
to be empty, and he then fetched a pot of beer and sat down by me.

After a little conversation he asked me what I intended to do, and I told him frankly that
I did not know; whereupon he observed that, provided I had no objection, he had little doubt
that I could be accommodated for some time at his inn.  "Our upper ostler," said he, "died
about a week ago; he was a clever fellow, and, besides his trade, understood reading and accounts."

"Dear me," said I, interrupting him, "I am not fitted for the place of ostler--moreover, I
refused the place of ostler at a public-house, which was offered to me only a few days ago."
The postillion burst into a laugh.  "Ostler at a public-house, indeed! why, you would not compare
a berth at a place like that with the situation of ostler at my inn, the first road-house in
England!  However, I was not thinking of the place of ostler for you; you are, as you say,
not fitted for it, at any rate, not at a house like this.  We have, moreover, the best under-ostler
in all England--old Bill, with the drawback that he is rather fond of drink.  We could make
shift with him very well, provided we could fall in with a man of writing and figures, who
could give an account of the hay and corn which comes in and goes out, and wouldn't object
to give a look occasionally at the yard.  Now it appears to me that you are just such a kind
of man, and, if you will allow me to speak to the governor, I don't doubt that he will gladly
take you, as he feels kindly disposed towards you from what he has heard me say concerning you."

"And what should I do with my horse?" said I.

"The horse need give you no uneasiness," said the postillion; "I know he will be welcome here
both for bed and manger, and, perhaps, in a little time you may find a purchaser, as a vast
number of sporting people frequent this house."  I offered two or three more objections, which
the postillion overcame with great force of argument, and the pot being nearly empty, he drained
it to the bottom drop, and then starting up, left me alone.

In about twenty minutes he returned, accompanied by a highly intelligent- looking individual,
dressed in blue and black, with a particularly white cravat, and without a hat on his head:
this individual, whom I should have mistaken for a gentleman but for the intelligence depicted
in his face, he introduced to me as the master of the inn.  The master of the inn shook me
warmly by the hand, told me that he was happy to see me in his house, and thanked me in the
handsomest terms for the kindness I had shown to his servant in the affair of the thunderstorm.
Then saying that he was informed I was out of employ, he assured me that he should be most
happy to engage me to keep his hay and corn account, and as general superintendent of the yard,
and that with respect to the horse, which he was told I had, he begged to inform me that I
was perfectly at liberty to keep it at the inn upon the very best, until I could find a purchaser,--that
with regard to wages--but he had no sooner mentioned wages than I cut him short, saying, that
provided I stayed I should be most happy to serve him for bed and board, and requested that
he would allow me until the next morning to consider of his offer; he willingly consented to
my request, and, begging that I would call for anything I pleased, left me alone with the postillion.

I passed that night until about ten o'clock with the postillion, when he left me, having to
drive a family about ten miles across the country; before his departure, however, I told him
that I had determined to accept the offer of his governor, as he called him.  At the bottom
of my heart I was most happy that an offer had been made, which secured to myself and the animal
a comfortable retreat at a moment when I knew not whither in the world to take myself and him.

CHAPTER XXIV

An Inn of Times gone by--A First-rate Publican--Hay and Corn--Old-fashioned Ostler--Highwaymen--Mounted
Police--Grooming.

The inn, of which I had become an inhabitant, was a place of infinite life and bustle.  Travellers
of all descriptions, from all the cardinal points, were continually stopping at it; and to
attend to their wants, and minister to their convenience, an army of servants, of one description
or other, was kept; waiters, chambermaids, grooms, postillions, shoe-blacks, cooks, scullions,
and what not, for there was a barber and hair-dresser, who had been at Paris, and talked French
with a cockney accent; the French sounding all the better, as no accent is so melodious as
the cockney.  Jacks creaked in the kitchens turning round spits, on which large joints of meat
piped and smoked before great big fires.  There was running up and down stairs, and along galleries,
slamming of doors, cries of "Coming, sir," and "Please to step this way, ma'am," during eighteen
hours of the four-and-twenty.  Truly a very great place for life and bustle was this inn. 
And often in after life, when lonely and melancholy, I have called up the time I spent there,
and never failed to become cheerful from the recollection.

I found the master of the house a very kind and civil person.  Before being an inn-keeper he
had been in some other line of business; but on the death of the former proprietor of the inn
had married his widow, who was still alive, but, being somewhat infirm, lived in a retired
part of the house.  I have said that he was kind and civil; he was, however, not one of those
people who suffer themselves to be made fools of by anybody; he knew his customers, and had
a calm, clear eye, which would look through a man without seeming to do so.  The accommodation
of his house was of the very best description; his wines were good, his viands equally so,
and his charges not immoderate; though he very properly took care of himself.  He was no vulgar
inn-keeper, had a host of friends, and deserved them all.  During the time I lived with him,
he was presented by a large assemblage of his friends and customers with a dinner at his own
house, which was very costly, and at which the best of wines were sported, and after the dinner
with a piece of plate estimated at fifty guineas.  He received the plate, made a neat speech
of thanks, and when the bill was called for, made another neat speech, in which he refused
to receive one farthing for the entertainment, ordering in at the same time two dozen more
of the best champagne, and sitting down amidst uproarious applause, and cries of "You shall
be no loser by it!"  Nothing very wonderful in such conduct, some people will say; I don't
say there is, nor have I any intention to endeavour to persuade the reader that the landlord
was a Carlo Boromeo; he merely gave a quid pro quo; but it is not every person who will give
you a quid pro quo.  Had he been a vulgar publican, he would have sent in a swinging bill after
receiving the plate; "but then no vulgar publican would have been presented with plate;" perhaps
not, but many a vulgar public character has been presented with plate, whose admirers never
received a quid pro quo, except in the shape of a swinging bill.

I found my duties of distributing hay and corn, and keeping an account thereof, anything but
disagreeable, particularly after I had acquired the good-will of the old ostler, who at first
looked upon me with rather an evil eye, considering me somewhat in the light of one who had
usurped an office which belonged to himself by the right of succession; but there was little
gall in the old fellow, and, by speaking kindly to him, never giving myself any airs of assumption;
but, above all, by frequently reading the newspapers to him--for though passionately fond of
news and politics, he was unable to read--I soon succeeded in placing myself on excellent terms
with him.  A regular character was that old ostler; he was a Yorkshireman by birth, but had
seen a great deal of life in the vicinity of London, to which, on the death of his parents,
who were very poor people, he went at a very early age.  Amongst other places where he had
served as ostler was a small inn at Hounslow, much frequented by highwaymen, whose exploits
he was fond of narrating, especially those of Jerry Abershaw, who, he said, was a capital rider;
and on hearing his accounts of that worthy, I half regretted that the old fellow had not been
in London, and I had not formed his acquaintance about the time I was thinking of writing the
life of the said Abershaw, not doubting that with his assistance, I could have produced a book
at least as remarkable as the life and adventures of that entirely imaginary personage Joseph
Sell; perhaps, however, I was mistaken; and whenever Abershaw's life shall appear before the
public--and my publisher credibly informs me that it has not yet appeared--I beg and entreat
the public to state which it likes best, the life of Abershaw, or that of Sell, for which latter
work I am informed that during the last few months there has been a prodigious demand.  My
old friend, however, after talking of Abershaw, would frequently add, that, good rider as Abershaw
certainly was, he was decidedly inferior to Richard Ferguson, generally called Galloping Dick,
who was a pal of Abershaw's, and had enjoyed a career as long, and nearly as remarkable as
his own.  I learned from him that both were capital customers at the Hounslow inn, and that
he had frequently drank with them in the corn-room.  He said that no man could desire more
jolly or entertaining companions over a glass of "summut;" but that upon the road it was anything
but desirable to meet them; there they were terrible, cursing and swearing, and thrusting the
muzzles of their pistols into people's mouths; and at this part of his locution the old man
winked, and said, in a somewhat lower voice, that upon the whole they were right in doing so,
and that when a person had once made up his mind to become a highwayman, his best policy was
to go the whole hog, fearing nothing, but making everybody afraid of him; that people never
thought of resisting a savage-faced, foul-mouthed highwayman, and if he were taken, were afraid
to bear witness against him, lest he should get off and cut their throats some time or other
upon the roads; whereas people would resist being robbed by a sneaking, pale-visaged rascal,
and would swear bodily against him on the first opportunity,--adding, that Abershaw and Ferguson,
two most awful fellows, had enjoyed a long career, whereas two disbanded officers of the army,
who wished to rob a coach like gentlemen, had begged the passengers' pardon, and talked of
hard necessity, had been set upon by the passengers themselves, amongst whom were three women,
pulled from their horses, conducted to Maidstone, and hanged with as little pity as such contemptible
fellows deserved.  "There is nothing like going the whole hog," he repeated, "and if ever I
had been a highwayman, I would have done so; I should have thought myself all the more safe;
and, moreover, shouldn't have despised myself.  To curry favour with those you are robbing,
sometimes at the expense of your own comrades, as I have known fellows do, why, it is the greatest--"

"So it is," interposed my friend the postillion, who chanced to be present at a considerable
part of the old ostler's discourse; "it is, as you say, the greatest of humbug, and merely,
after all, gets a fellow into trouble; but no regular bred highwayman would do it.  I say,
George, catch the Pope of Rome trying to curry favour with anybody he robs; catch old Mumbo
Jumbo currying favour with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Dean and Chapter, should he
meet them in a stage-coach; it would be with him, Bricconi Abbasso, as he knocked their teeth
out with the butt of his trombone; and the old regular-built ruffian would be all the safer
for it, as Bill would say, as ten to one the Archbishop and Chapter, after such a spice of
his quality, would be afraid to swear against him, and to hang him, even if he were in their
power, though that would be the proper way; for, if it is the greatest of all humbug for a
highwayman to curry favour with those he robs, the next greatest is to try to curry favour
with a highwayman when you have got him, by letting him off."

Finding the old man so well acquainted with the history of highwaymen, and taking considerable
interest in the subject, having myself edited a book containing the lives of many remarkable
people who had figured on the highway, I forthwith asked him how it was that the trade of highwaymen
had become extinct in England, as at present we never heard of any one following it.  Whereupon
he told me that many causes had contributed to bring about that result; the principal of which
were the following:--the refusal to license houses which were known to afford shelter to highwaymen,
which, amongst many others, had caused the inn at Hounslow to be closed; the inclosure of many
a wild heath in the country, on which they were in the habit of lurking, and particularly the
establishing in the neighbourhood of London of a well-armed mounted patrol, who rode the highwaymen
down, and delivered them up to justice, which hanged them without ceremony.

"And that would be the way to deal with Mumbo Jumbo and his gang," said the postillion, "should
they show their visages in these realms; and I hear by the newspapers that they are becoming
every day more desperate. Take away the license from their public-houses, cut down the rookeries
and shadowy old avenues in which they are fond of lying in wait, in order to sally out upon
people as they pass in the roads; but, above all, establish a good mounted police to ride after
the ruffians and drag them by the scruff of the neck to the next clink, where they might lie
till they could be properly dealt with by law; instead of which, the Government are repealing
the wise old laws enacted against such characters, giving fresh licenses every day to their
public-houses, and saying that it would be a pity to cut down their rookeries and thickets
because they look so very picturesque; and, in fact, giving them all kind of encouragement;
why, if such behaviour is not enough to drive an honest man mad, I know not what is.  It is
of no use talking, I only wish the power were in my hands, and if I did not make short work
of them, might I be a mere jackass postillion all the remainder of my life."

Besides acquiring from the ancient ostler a great deal of curious information respecting the
ways and habits of the heroes of the road, with whom he had come in contact in the early portion
of his life, I picked up from him many excellent hints relating to the art of grooming horses.
Whilst at the inn, I frequently groomed the stage and post-horses, and those driven up by travellers
in their gigs: I was not compelled, nor indeed expected, to do so; but I took pleasure in the
occupation; and I remember at that period one of the principal objects of my ambition was to
be a first-rate groom, and to make the skins of the creatures I took in hand look sleek and
glossy like those of moles.  I have said that I derived valuable hints from the old man, and,
indeed, became a very tolerable groom, but there was a certain finishing touch which I could
never learn from him, though he possessed it himself, and which I could never attain to by
my own endeavours; though my want of success certainly did not proceed from want of application,
for I have rubbed the horses down, purring and buzzing all the time, after the genuine ostler
fashion, until the perspiration fell in heavy drops upon my shoes, and when I had done my best
and asked the old fellow what he thought of my work, I could never extract from him more than
a kind of grunt, which might be translated, "Not so very bad, but I have seen a horse groomed
much better," which leads me to suppose that a person, in order to be a first-rate groom, must
have something in him when he is born which I had not, and, indeed, which many other people
have not who pretend to be grooms.  What does the reader think?

CHAPTER XXV

Stable Hartshorn--How to Manage a Horse on a Journey--Your Best Friend.

Of one thing I am certain, that the reader must be much delighted with the wholesome smell
of the stable, with which many of these pages are redolent; what a contrast to the sickly odours
exhaled from those of some of my contemporaries, especially of those who pretend to be of the
highly fashionable class, and who treat of reception-rooms, well may they be styled so, in
which dukes, duchesses, earls, countesses, archbishops, bishops, mayors, mayoresses--not forgetting
the writers themselves, both male and female--congregate and press upon one another; how cheering,
how refreshing, after having been nearly knocked down with such an atmosphere, to come in contact
with genuine stable hartshorn.  Oh! the reader shall have yet more of the stable, and of that
old ostler, for which he or she will doubtless exclaim, "Much obliged!"--and, lest I should
forget to perform my promise, the reader shall have it now.

I shall never forget an harangue from the mouth of the old man, which I listened to one warm
evening as he and I sat on the threshold of the stable, after having attended to some of the
wants of a batch of coach- horses.  It related to the manner in which a gentleman should take
care of his horse and self, whilst engaged in a journey on horseback, and was addressed to
myself, on the supposition of my one day coming to an estate, and of course becoming a gentleman.

"When you are a gentleman," said he, "should you ever wish to take a journey on a horse of
your own, and you could not have a much better than the one you have here eating its fill in
the box yonder--I wonder, by the bye, how you ever came by it--you can't do better than follow
the advice I am about to give you, both with respect to your animal and yourself. Before you
start, merely give your horse a couple of handfuls of corn and a little water, somewhat under
a quart, and if you drink a pint of water yourself out of the pail, you will feel all the better
during the whole day; then you may walk and trot your animal for about ten miles, till you
come to some nice inn, where you may get down and see your horse led into a nice stall, telling
the ostler not to feed him till you come.  If the ostler happens to be a dog-fancier, and has
an English terrier-dog like that of mine there, say what a nice dog it is, and praise its black
and tawn; and if he does not happen to be a dog-fancier, ask him how he's getting on, and whether
he ever knew worse times; that kind of thing will please the ostler, and he will let you do
just what you please with your own horse, and when your back is turned, he'll say to his comrades
what a nice gentleman you are, and how he thinks he has seen you before; then go and sit down
to breakfast, and, before you have finished breakfast, get up and go and give your horse a
feed of corn; chat with the ostler two or three minutes till your horse has taken the shine
out of his corn, which will prevent the ostler taking any of it away when your back is turned,
for such things are sometimes done--not that I ever did such a thing myself when I was at the
inn at Hounslow.  Oh, dear me, no!  Then go and finish your breakfast, and when you have finished
your breakfast and called for the newspaper, go and water your horse, letting him have one
pailful, then give him another feed of corn, and enter into discourse with the ostler about
bull-baiting, the prime minister, and the like; and when your horse has once more taken the
shine out of his corn, go back to your room and your newspaper--and I hope for your sake it
may be the Globe, for that's the best paper going--then pull the bell-rope and order in your
bill, which you will pay without counting it up--supposing you to be a gentleman.  Give the
waiter sixpence, and order out your horse, and when your horse is out, pay for the corn, and
give the ostler a shilling, then mount your horse and walk him gently for five miles; and whilst
you are walking him in this manner, it may be as well to tell you to take care that you do
not let him down and smash his knees, more especially if the road be a particularly good one,
for it is not at a desperate hiverman pace, and over very bad roads, that a horse tumbles and
smashes his knees, but on your particularly nice road, when the horse is going gently and lazily,
and is half asleep, like the gemman on his back; well, at the end of the five miles, when the
horse has digested his food, and is all right, you may begin to push your horse on, trotting
him a mile at a heat, and then walking him a quarter of a one, that his wind may be not distressed;
and you may go on in that way for thirty miles, never galloping, of course, for none but fools
or hivermen ever gallop horses on roads; and at the end of that distance you may stop at some
other nice inn to dinner.  I say, when your horse is led into the stable, after that same thirty
miles' trotting and walking, don't let the saddle be whisked off at once, for if you do your
horse will have such a sore back as will frighten you, but let your saddle remain on your horse's
back, with the girths loosened, till after his next feed of corn, and be sure that he has no
corn, much less water, till after a long hour and more; after he is fed he may be watered to
the tune of half a pail, and then the ostler can give him a regular rub down; you may then
sit down to dinner, and when you have dined get up and see to your horse as you did after breakfast,
in fact, you must do much after the same fashion you did at t'other inn; see to your horse,
and by no means disoblige the ostler. So when you have seen to your horse a second time, you
will sit down to your bottle of wine--supposing you to be a gentleman--and after you have finished
it, and your argument about the corn-laws with any commercial gentleman who happens to be in
the room, you may mount your horse again--not forgetting to do the proper thing to the waiter
and ostler; you may mount your horse again and ride him, as you did before, for about five
and twenty miles, at the end of which you may put up for the night after a very fair day's
journey, for no gentleman--supposing he weighs sixteen stone, as I suppose you will by the
time you become a gentleman--ought to ride a horse more than sixty-five miles in one day, provided
he has any regard for his horse's back, or his own either.  See to your horse at night, and
have him well rubbed down.  The next day you may ride your horse forty miles, just as you please,
but never foolishly, and those forty miles will bring you to your journey's end, unless your
journey be a plaguy long one, and if so, never ride your horse more than five and thirty miles
a day, always, however, seeing him well fed, and taking more care of him than yourself; which
is but right and reasonable, seeing as how the horse is the best animal of the two."

"When you are a gentleman," said he, after a pause, "the first thing you must think about is
to provide yourself with a good horse for your own particular riding; you will, perhaps, keep
a coach and pair, but they will be less your own than your lady's, should you have one, and
your young gentry, should you have any; or, if you have neither, for madam, your housekeeper,
and the upper female servants; so you need trouble your head less about them, though, of course,
you would not like to pay away your money for screws; but be sure you get a good horse for
your own riding; and that you may have a good chance of having a good one, buy one that's young
and has plenty of belly--a little more than the one has which you now have, though you are
not yet a gentleman; you will, of course, look to his head, his withers, legs and other points,
but never buy a horse at any price that has not plenty of belly; no horse that has not belly
is ever a good feeder, and a horse that a'n't a good feeder can't be a good horse; never buy
a horse that is drawn up in the belly behind; a horse of that description can't feed, and can
never carry sixteen stone.

"So when you have got such a horse be proud of it--as I daresay you are of the one you have
now--and wherever you go swear there a'n't another to match it in the country, and if anybody
gives you the lie, take him by the nose and tweak it off, just as you would do if anybody were
to speak ill of your lady, or, for want of her, of your housekeeper.  Take care of your horse,
as you would of the apple of your eye--I am sure I would, if I were a gentleman, which I don't
ever expect to be, and hardly wish, seeing as how I am sixty-nine, and am rather too old to
ride--yes, cherish and take care of your horse as perhaps the best friend you have in the world;
for, after all, who will carry you through thick and thin as your horse will? not your gentlemen
friends, I warrant, nor your upper servants, male or female; perhaps your lady would, that
is, if she is a whopper, and one of the right sort; the others would be more likely to take
up mud and pelt you with it, provided they saw you in trouble, than to help you.  So take care
of your horse, and feed him every day with your own hands; give him three quarters of a peck
of corn each day, mixed up with a little hay-chaff, and allow him besides one hundredweight
of hay in the course of the week; some say that the hay should be hardland hay, because it
is the wholesomest, but I say, let it be clover hay, because the horse likes it best; give
him through summer and winter, once a week, a pailful of bran mash, cold in summer and in winter
hot; ride him gently about the neighbourhood every day, by which means you will give exercise
to yourself and horse, and, moreover, have the satisfaction of exhibiting yourself and your
horse to advantage, and hearing, perhaps, the men say what a fine horse, and the ladies saying
what a fine man: never let your groom mount your horse, as it is ten to one, if you do, your
groom will be wishing to show off before company, and will fling your horse down.  I was groom
to a gemman before I went to the inn at Hounslow, and flung him a horse down worth ninety guineas,
by endeavouring to show off before some ladies that I met on the road.  Turn your horse out
to grass throughout May and the first part of June, for then the grass is sweetest, and the
flies don't sting so bad as they do later in summer; afterwards merely turn him out occasionally
in the swale of the morn and the evening; after September the grass is good for little, lash
and sour at best; every horse should go out to grass, if not his blood becomes full of greasy
humours, and his wind is apt to become affected, but he ought to be kept as much as possible
from the heat and flies, always got up at night, and never turned out late in the year--Lord!
if I had always such a nice attentive person to listen to me as you are, I could go on talking
about 'orses to the end of time."

CHAPTER XXVI

The Stage--Coachmen of England--A Bully Served Out--Broughton's Guard--The Brazen Head.

I lived on very good terms, not only with the master and the old ostler, but with all the domestics
and hangers on at the inn; waiters, chambermaids, cooks, and scullions, not forgetting the
"boots," of which there were three.  As for the postillions, I was sworn brother with them
all, and some of them went so far as to swear that I was the best fellow in the world; for
which high opinion entertained by them of me, I believe I was principally indebted to the good
account their comrade gave of me, whom I had so hospitably received in the dingle.  I repeat
that I lived on good terms with all the people connected with the inn, and was noticed and
spoken kindly to by some of the guests--especially by that class termed commercial travellers--all
of whom were great friends and patronizers of the landlord, and were the principal promoters
of the dinner, and subscribers to the gift of plate, which I have already spoken of, the whole
fraternity striking me as the jolliest set of fellows imaginable, the best customers to an
inn, and the most liberal to servants; there was one description of persons, however, frequenting
the inn, which I did not like at all, and which I did not get on well with, and these people
were the stage-coachmen.

The stage-coachmen of England, at the time of which I am speaking, considered themselves mighty
fine gentry, nay, I verily believe the most important personages of the realm, and their entertaining
this high opinion of themselves can scarcely be wondered at; they were low fellows, but masters
at driving; driving was in fashion, and sprigs of nobility used to dress as coachmen and imitate
the slang and behaviour of the coachmen, from whom occasionally they would take lessons in
driving as they sat beside them on the box, which post of honour any sprig of nobility who
happened to take a place on a coach claimed as his unquestionable right; and these sprigs would
smoke cigars and drink sherry with the coachmen in bar-rooms, and on the road; and, when bidding
them farewell, would give them a guinea or a half-guinea, and shake them by the hand, so that
these fellows, being low fellows, very naturally thought no small liquor of themselves, but
would talk familiarly of their friends lords so and so, the honourable misters so and so, and
Sir Harry and Sir Charles, and be wonderfully saucy to any one who was not a lord, or something
of the kind; and this high opinion of themselves received daily augmentation from the servile
homage paid them by the generality of the untitled male passengers, especially those on the
fore part of the coach, who used to contend for the honour of sitting on the box with the coachman
when no sprig was nigh to put in his claim.  Oh! what servile homage these craven creatures
did pay these same coach fellows, more especially after witnessing this or t'other act of brutality
practised upon the weak and unoffending--upon some poor friendless woman travelling with but
little money, and perhaps a brace of hungry children with her, or upon some thin and half-starved
man travelling on the hind part of the coach from London to Liverpool with only eighteen pence
in his pocket after his fare was paid, to defray his expenses on the road; for as the insolence
of these knights was vast, so was their rapacity enormous; they had been so long accustomed
to have crowns and half-crowns rained upon them by their admirers and flatterers, that they
would look at a shilling, for which many an honest labourer was happy to toil for ten hours
under a broiling sun, with the utmost contempt; would blow upon it derisively, or fillip it
into the air before they pocketed it; but when nothing was given them, as would occasionally
happen--for how could they receive from those who had nothing? and nobody was bound to give
them anything, as they had certain wages from their employers--then what a scene would ensue!
Truly the brutality and rapacious insolence of English coachmen had reached a climax; it was
time that these fellows should be disenchanted, and the time--thank Heaven!--was not far distant.
Let the craven dastards who used to curry favour with them, and applaud their brutality, lament
their loss now that they and their vehicles have disappeared from the roads; I, who have ever
been an enemy to insolence, cruelty, and tyranny, loathe their memory, and, what is more, am
not afraid to say so, well aware of the storm of vituperation, partly learnt from them, which
I may expect from those who used to fall down and worship them.

Amongst the coachmen who frequented the inn was one who was called "the bang-up coachman."
He drove to our inn, in the fore part of every day, one of what were called the fast coaches,
and afterwards took back the corresponding vehicle.  He stayed at our house about twenty minutes,
during which time the passengers of the coach which he was to return with dined; those at least
who were inclined for dinner, and could pay for it. He derived his sobriquet of "the bang-up
coachman" partly from his being dressed in the extremity of coach dandyism, and partly from
the peculiar insolence of his manner, and the unmerciful fashion in which he was in the habit
of lashing on the poor horses committed to his charge.  He was a large tall fellow, of about
thirty, with a face which, had it not been bloated by excess, and insolence and cruelty stamped
most visibly upon it, might have been called good-looking.  His insolence indeed was so great,
that he was hated by all the minor fry connected with coaches along the road upon which he
drove, especially the ostlers, whom he was continually abusing or finding fault with.  Many
was the hearty curse which he received when his back was turned; but the generality of people
were much afraid of him, for he was a swinging strong fellow, and had the reputation of being
a fighter, and in one or two instances had beaten in a barbarous manner individuals who had
quarrelled with him.

I was nearly having a fracas with this worthy.  One day, after he had been drinking sherry
with a sprig, he swaggered into the yard where I happened to be standing; just then a waiter
came by carrying upon a tray part of a splendid Cheshire cheese, with a knife, plate, and napkin.
Stopping the waiter, the coachman cut with the knife a tolerably large lump out of the very
middle of the cheese, stuck it on the end of the knife, and putting it to his mouth nibbled
a slight piece off it, and then, tossing the rest away with disdain, flung the knife down upon
the tray, motioning the waiter to proceed; "I wish," said I, "you may not want before you die
what you have just flung away," whereupon the fellow turned furiously towards me; just then,
however, his coach being standing at the door, there was a cry for coachman, so that he was
forced to depart, contenting himself for the present with shaking his fist at me, and threatening
to serve me out on the first opportunity; before, however, the opportunity occurred he himself
got served out in a most unexpected manner.

The day after this incident he drove his coach to the inn, and after having dismounted and
received the contributions of the generality of the passengers, he strutted up, with a cigar
in his mouth, to an individual who had come with him, and who had just asked me a question
with respect to the direction of a village about three miles off, to which he was going.  "Remember
the coachman," said the knight of the box to this individual, who was a thin person of about
sixty, with a white hat, rather shabby black coat, and buff-coloured trousers, and who held
an umbrella and a small bundle in his hand.  "If you expect me to give you anything," said
he to the coachman, "you are mistaken; I will give you nothing.  You have been very insolent
to me as I rode behind you on the coach, and have encouraged two or three trumpery fellows,
who rode along with you, to cut scurvy jokes at my expense, and now you come to me for money;
I am not so poor, but I could have given you a shilling had you been civil; as it is, I will
give you nothing."  "Oh! you won't, won't you?" said the coachman; "dear me!  I hope I shan't
starve because you won't give me anything--a shilling! why, I could afford to give you twenty
if I thought fit, you pauper! civil to you, indeed! things are come to a fine pass if I need
be civil to you!  Do you know who you are speaking to? why, the best lords in the country are
proud to speak to me. Why, it was only the other day that the Marquis of--said to me--" and
then he went on to say what the Marquis said to him; after which, flinging down his cigar,
he strutted up the road, swearing to himself about paupers.

"You say it is three miles to ---," said the individual to me; "I think I shall light my pipe,
and smoke it as I go along."  Thereupon he took out from a side-pocket a tobacco-box and short
meerschaum pipe, and implements for striking a light, filled his pipe, lighted it, and commenced
smoking.  Presently the coachman drew near.  I saw at once that there was mischief in his eye;
the man smoking was standing with his back towards him, and he came so nigh to him, seemingly
purposely, that as he passed a puff of smoke came of necessity against his face.  "What do
you mean by smoking in my face?" said he, striking the pipe of the elderly individual out of
his mouth.  The other, without manifesting much surprise, said, "I thank you; and if you will
wait a minute, I will give you a receipt for that favour;" then gathering up his pipe, and
taking off his coat and hat, he laid them on a stepping-block which stood near, and rubbing
his hands together, he advanced towards the coachman in an attitude of offence, holding his
hands crossed very near to his face.  The coachman, who probably expected anything but such
a movement from a person of the age and appearance of the individual whom he had insulted,
stood for a moment motionless with surprise; but, recollecting himself, he pointed at him derisively
with his finger; the next moment, however, the other was close upon him, had struck aside the
extended hand with his left fist, and given him a severe blow on the nose with his right, which
he immediately followed by a left-hand blow in the eye; then drawing his body slightly backward,
with the velocity of lightning he struck the coachman full in the mouth, and the last blow
was the severest of all, for it cut the coachman's lips nearly through; blows so quickly and
sharply dealt I had never seen.  The coachman reeled like a fir-tree in a gale, and seemed
nearly unsensed.  "Ho! what's this? a fight! a fight!" sounded from a dozen voices, and people
came running from all directions to see what was going on.  The coachman, coming somewhat to
himself, disencumbered himself of his coat and hat; and, encouraged by two or three of his
brothers of the whip, showed some symptoms of fighting, endeavouring to close with his foe,
but the attempt was vain, for his foe was not to be closed with; he did not shift or dodge
about, but warded off the blows of his opponent with the greatest sang-froid, always using
the guard which I have already described, and putting in, in return, short chopping blows with
the swiftness of lightning.  In a very few minutes the countenance of the coachman was literally
cut to pieces, and several of his teeth were dislodged; at length he gave in; stung with mortification,
however, he repented, and asked for another round; it was granted, to his own complete demolition.
The coachman did not drive his coach back that day, he did not appear on the box again for
a week; but he never held up his head afterwards.  Before I quitted the inn, he had disappeared
from the road, going no one knew where.

The coachman, as I have said before, was very much disliked upon the road, but there was an
esprit de corps amongst the coachmen, and those who stood by did not like to see their brother
chastised in such tremendous fashion.  "I never saw such a fight before," said one.  "Fight!
why, I don't call it a fight at all; this chap here ha'n't got a scratch, whereas Tom is cut
to pieces; it is all along of that guard of his; if Tom could have got within his guard he
would have soon served the old chap out."  "So he would," said another, "it was all owing to
that guard. However, I think I see into it, and if I had not to drive this afternoon, I would
have a turn with the old fellow and soon serve him out."  "I will fight him now for a guinea,"
said the other coachman, half taking off his coat; observing, however, that the elderly individual
made a motion towards him, he hitched it upon his shoulder again, and added, "that is, if he
had not been fighting already, but as it is, I am above taking an advantage, especially of
such a poor old creature as that."  And when he had said this, he looked around him, and there
was a feeble titter of approbation from two or three of the craven crew, who were in the habit
of currying favour with the coachmen.  The elderly individual looked for a moment at these
last, and then said, "To such fellows as you I have nothing to say;" then turning to the coachmen,
"and as for you," he said, "ye cowardly bullies, I have but one word, which is, that your reign
upon the roads is nearly over, and that a time is coming when ye will no longer be wanted or
employed in your present capacity, when ye will either have to drive dung-carts, assist as
ostlers at village ale-houses, or rot in the workhouse."  Then putting on his coat and hat,
and taking up his bundle, not forgetting his meerschaum, and the rest of his smoking apparatus,
he departed on his way.  Filled with curiosity, I followed him.

"I am quite astonished that you should be able to use your hands in the way you have done,"
said I, as I walked with this individual in the direction in which he was bound.

"I will tell you how I became able to do so," said the elderly individual, proceeding to fill
and light his pipe as he walked along.  "My father was a journeyman engraver, who lived in
a very riotous neighbourhood in the outskirts of London.  Wishing to give me something of an
education, he sent me to a day-school, two or three streets distant from where we lived, and
there, being rather a puny boy, I suffered much persecution from my schoolfellows, who were
a very blackguard set.  One day, as I was running home, with one of my tormentors pursuing
me, old Sergeant Broughton, the retired fighting-man, seized me by the arm--"

"Dear me," said I, "has it ever been your luck to be acquainted with Sergeant Broughton?"

"You may well call it luck," said the elderly individual; "but for him I should never have
been able to make my way through the world.  He lived only four doors from our house; so, as
I was running along the street, with my tyrant behind me, Sergeant Broughton seized me by the
arm.  'Stop, my boy,' said he; 'I have frequently seen that scamp ill-treating you; now I will
teach you how to send him home with a bloody nose; down with your bag of books; and now, my
game chick,' whispered he to me, placing himself between me and my adversary, so that he could
not observe his motions; 'clench your fist in this manner, and hold your arms in this, and
when he strikes at you, move them as I now show you, and he can't hurt you; now, don't be afraid,
but go at him.'  I confess that I was somewhat afraid, but I considered myself in some degree
under the protection of the famous Sergeant, and, clenching my fist, I went at my foe, using
the guard which my ally recommended.  The result corresponded to a certain degree with the
predictions of the Sergeant; I gave my foe a bloody nose and a black eye, though, notwithstanding
my recent lesson in the art of self-defence, he contrived to give me two or three clumsy blows.
From that moment I was the especial favourite of the Sergeant, who gave me further lessons,
so that in a little time I became a very fair boxer, beating everybody of my own size who attacked
me.  The old gentleman, however, made me promise never to be quarrelsome, nor to turn his instructions
to account, except in self-defence.  I have always borne in mind my promise, and have made
it a point of conscience never to fight unless absolutely compelled.  Folks may rail against
boxing if they please, but being able to box may sometimes stand a quiet man in good stead.
How should I have fared to-day, but for the instructions of Sergeant Broughton?  But for them,
the brutal ruffian who insulted me must have passed unpunished.  He will not soon forget the
lesson which I have just given him--the only lesson he could understand.  What would have been
the use of reasoning with a fellow of that description?  Brave old Broughton!  I owe him much."

"And your manner of fighting," said I, "was the manner employed by Sergeant Broughton?"

"Yes," said my new acquaintance; "it was the manner in which he beat every one who attempted
to contend with him, till, in an evil hour, he entered the ring with Slack, without any training
or preparation, and by a chance blow lost the battle to a man who had been beaten with ease
by those who, in the hands of Broughton, appeared like so many children.  It was the way of
fighting of him who first taught Englishmen to box scientifically, who was the head and father
of the fighters of what is now called the old school, the last of which were Johnson and Big Ben."

"A wonderful man, that Big Ben," said I.

"He was so," said the elderly individual; "but had it not been for Broughton, I question whether
Ben would have ever been the fighter he was.  Oh! there was no one like old Broughton; but
for him I should at the present moment be sneaking along the road, pursued by the hissings
and hootings of the dirty flatterers of that blackguard coachman."

"What did you mean," said I, "by those words of yours, that the coachmen would speedily disappear
from the roads?"

"I meant," said he, "that a new method of travelling is about to be established, which will
supersede the old.  I am a poor engraver, as my father was before me; but engraving is an intellectual
trade, and by following it, I have been brought in contact with some of the cleverest men in
England.  It has even made me acquainted with the projector of the scheme, which he has told
me many of the wisest heads of England have been dreaming of during a period of six hundred
years, and which it seems was alluded to by a certain Brazen Head in the story-book of Friar
Bacon, who is generally supposed to have been a wizard, but in reality was a great philosopher.
Young man, in less than twenty years, by which time I shall be dead and gone, England will
be surrounded with roads of metal, on which armies may travel with mighty velocity, and of
which the walls of brass and iron by which the friar proposed to defend his native land are
the types."  He then, shaking me by the hand, proceeded on his way, whilst I returned to the inn.

CHAPTER XXVII

Francis Ardry--His Misfortunes--Dog and Lion Fight--Great Men of the World.

A few days after the circumstance which I have last commemorated, it chanced that, as I was
standing at the door of the inn, one of the numerous stage-coaches which were in the habit
of stopping there, drove up, and several passengers got down.  I had assisted a woman with
a couple of children to dismount, and had just delivered to her a band-box, which appeared
to be her only property, which she had begged me to fetch down from the roof, when I felt a
hand laid upon my shoulder, and heard a voice exclaim, "Is it possible, old fellow, that I
find you in this place?"  I turned round, and, wrapped in a large blue cloak, I beheld my good
friend Francis Ardry.  I shook him most warmly by the hand, and said, "If you are surprised
to see me, I am no less so to see you; where are you bound to?"

"I am bound for L-; at any rate, I am booked for that sea-port," said my friend in reply.

"I am sorry for it," said I, "for in that case we shall have to part in a quarter of an hour,
the coach by which you came stopping no longer."

"And whither are you bound?" demanded my friend.

"I am stopping at present in this house, quite undetermined as to what to do."

"Then come along with me," said Francis Ardry.

"That I can scarcely do," said I; "I have a horse in the stall which I cannot afford to ruin
by racing to L--- by the side of your coach."

My friend mused for a moment: "I have no particular business at L---," said he; "I was merely
going thither to pass a day or two, till an affair, in which I am deeply interested, at C---
shall come off.  I think I shall stay with you for four-and-twenty hours at least; I have been
rather melancholy of late, and cannot afford to part with a friend like you at the present
moment; it is an unexpected piece of good fortune to have met you; and I have not been very
fortunate of late," he added, sighing.

"Well," said I, "I am glad to see you once more, whether fortunate, or not; where is your baggage?"

"Yon trunk is mine," said Francis, pointing to a trunk of black Russian leather upon the coach.

"We will soon have it down," said I; and at a word which I gave to one of the hangers-on of
the inn, the trunk was taken from the top of the coach. "Now," said I to Francis Ardry, "follow
me, I am a person of some authority in this house;" thereupon I led Francis Ardry into the
house, and a word which I said to a waiter forthwith installed Francis Ardry in a comfortable
private sitting-room, and his trunk in the very best sleeping-room of our extensive establishment.

It was now about one o'clock: Francis Ardry ordered dinner for two, to be ready at four, and
a pint of sherry to be brought forthwith, which I requested my friend the waiter might be the
very best, and which in effect turned out as I requested; we sat down, and when we had drunk
to each other's health, Frank requested me to make known to him how I had contrived to free
myself from my embarrassments in London, what I had been about since I quitted that city, and
the present posture of my affairs.

I related to Francis Ardry how I had composed the Life of Joseph Sell, and how the sale of
it to the bookseller had enabled me to quit London with money in my pocket, which had supported
me during a long course of ramble in the country, into the particulars of which I, however,
did not enter with any considerable degree of fulness.  I summed up my account by saying that
"I was at present a kind of overlooker in the stables of the inn, had still some pounds in
my purse, and, moreover, a capital horse in the stall."

"No very agreeable posture of affairs," said Francis Ardry, looking rather seriously at me.

"I make no complaints," said I, "my prospects are not very bright, it is true, but sometimes
I have visions both waking and sleeping, which, though always strange, are invariably agreeable.
Last night, in my chamber near the hayloft, I dreamt that I had passed over an almost interminable
wilderness--an enormous wall rose before me, the wall, methought, was the great wall of China:--strange
figures appeared to be beckoning to me from the top of the wall; such visions are not exactly
to be sneered at.  Not that such phantasmagoria," said I, raising my voice, "are to be compared
for a moment with such desirable things as fashion, fine clothes, cheques from uncles, parliamentary
interest, the love of splendid females.  Ah! woman's love," said I, and sighed.

"What's the matter with the fellow?" said Francis Ardry.

"There is nothing like it," said I.

"Like what?"

"Love, divine love," said I.

"Confound love," said Francis Ardry, "I hate the very name; I have made myself a pretty fool
by it, but trust me for ever being at such folly again.  In an evil hour I abandoned my former
pursuits and amusements for it; in one morning spent at Joey's there was more real pleasure
than in--"

"Surely," said I, "you are not hankering after dog-fighting again, a sport which none but the
gross and unrefined care anything for?  No, one's thoughts should be occupied by something
higher and more rational than dog-fighting; and what better than love--divine love?  Oh, there's
nothing like it!"

"Pray, don't talk nonsense," said Francis Ardry.

"Nonsense," said I; "why I was repeating, to the best of my recollection, what I heard you
say on a former occasion."

"If ever I talked such stuff," said Francis Ardry, "I was a fool; and indeed I cannot deny
that I have been one: no, there's no denying that I have been a fool.  What do you think? that
false Annette has cruelly abandoned me."

"Well," said I, "perhaps you have yourself to thank for her having done so; did you never treat
her with coldness, and repay her marks of affectionate interest with strange fits of eccentric
humour?"

"Lord! how little you know of women," said Francis Ardry; "had I done as you suppose, I should
probably have possessed her at the present moment. I treated her in a manner diametrically
opposite to that.  I loaded her with presents, was always most assiduous to her, always at
her feet, as I may say, yet she nevertheless abandoned me--and for whom?  I am almost ashamed
to say--for a fiddler."

I took a glass of wine, Francis Ardry followed my example, and then proceeded to detail to
me the treatment which he had experienced from Annette, and from what he said, it appeared
that her conduct to him had been in the highest degree reprehensible; notwithstanding he had
indulged her in everything, she was never civil to him, but loaded him continually with taunts
and insults, and had finally, on his being unable to supply her with a sum of money which she
had demanded, decamped from the lodgings which he had taken for her, carrying with her all
the presents which at various times he had bestowed upon her, and had put herself under the
protection of a gentleman who played the bassoon at the Italian Opera, at which place it appeared
that her sister had lately been engaged as a danseuse.  My friend informed me that at first
he had experienced great agony at the ingratitude of Annette, but at last had made up his mind
to forget her, and, in order more effectually to do so, had left London with the intention
of witnessing a fight, which was shortly coming off at a town in these parts, between some
dogs and a lion; which combat, he informed me, had for some time past been looked forward to
with intense eagerness by the gentlemen of the sporting world.

I commended him for his resolution, at the same time advising him not to give up his mind entirely
to dog-fighting, as he had formerly done, but, when the present combat should be over, to return
to his rhetorical studies, and above all to marry some rich and handsome lady on the first
opportunity, as, with his person and expectations, he had only to sue for the hand of the daughter
of a marquis to be successful, telling him, with a sigh, that all women were not Annettes,
and that, upon the whole, there was nothing like them.  To which advice he answered, that he
intended to return to rhetoric as soon as the lion fight should be over, but that he never
intended to marry, having had enough of women; adding that he was glad he had no sister, as,
with the feelings which he entertained with respect to her sex, he should be unable to treat
her with common affection, and concluded by repeating a proverb which he had learnt from an
Arab whom he had met at Venice, to the effect, that, "one who has been stung by a snake, shivers
at the sight of a sting."

After a little more conversation, we strolled to the stable, where my horse was standing; my
friend, who was a connoisseur in horseflesh, surveyed the animal with attention, and after
inquiring where and how I had obtained him, asked what I intended to do with him; on my telling
him that I was undetermined, and that I was afraid the horse was likely to prove a burden to
me, he said, "It is a noble animal, and if you mind what you are about, you may make a small
fortune by him.  I do not want such an animal myself, nor do I know any one who does; but a
great horse- fair will be held shortly at a place where, it is true, I have never been, but
of which I have heard a great deal from my acquaintances, where it is said a first-rate horse
is always sure to fetch its value; that place is Horncastle, in Lincolnshire, you should take
him thither."

Francis Ardry and myself dined together, and after dinner partook of a bottle of the best port
which the inn afforded.  After a few glasses, we had a great deal of conversation; I again
brought the subject of marriage and love, divine love, upon the carpet, but Francis almost
immediately begged me to drop it; and on my having the delicacy to comply, he reverted to dog-fighting,
on which he talked well and learnedly; amongst other things, he said it was a princely sport
of great antiquity, and quoted from Quintus Curtius to prove that the princes of India must
have been of the fancy, they having, according to that author, treated Alexander to a fight
between certain dogs and a lion.  Becoming, notwithstanding my friend's eloquence and learning,
somewhat tired of the subject, I began to talk about Alexander.  Francis Ardry said he was
one of the two great men whom the world has produced, the other being Napoleon; I replied that
I believed Tamerlane was a greater man than either; but Francis Ardry knew nothing of Tamerlane,
save what he had gathered from the play of Timour the Tartar.  "No," said he, "Alexander and
Napoleon are the great men of the world, their names are known everywhere.  Alexander has been
dead upwards of two thousand years, but the very English bumpkins sometimes christen their
boys by the name of Alexander--can there be a greater evidence of his greatness?  As for Napoleon,
there are some parts of India in which his bust is worshipped." Wishing to make up a triumvirate,
I mentioned the name of Wellington, to which Francis Ardry merely said, "bah!" and resumed
the subject of dog- fighting.

Francis Ardry remained at the inn during that day and the next, and then departed to the dog
and lion fight; I never saw him afterwards, and merely heard of him once after a lapse of some
years, and what I then heard was not exactly what I could have wished to hear.  He did not
make much of the advantages which he possessed, a pity, for how great were those advantages--person,
intellect, eloquence, connection, riches! yet, with all these advantages, one thing highly
needful seems to have been wanting in Francis.  A desire, a craving, to perform something great
and good.  Oh! what a vast deal may be done with intellect, courage, riches, accompanied by
the desire of doing something great and good!  Why, a person may carry the blessings of civilization
and religion to barbarous, yet at the same time beautiful and romantic lands; and what a triumph
there is for him who does so! what a crown of glory! of far greater value than those surrounding
the brows of your mere conquerors.  Yet who has done so in these times?  Not many; not three,
not two, something seems to have been always wanting; there is, however, one instance, in which
the various requisites have been united, and the crown, the most desirable in the world--at
least which I consider to be the most desirable--achieved, and only one, that of Brooke of Borneo.

CHAPTER XXVIII

Mr. Platitude and the Man in Black--The Postillion's Adventures--The Lone House--A Goodly Assemblage.

It never rains, but it pours.  I was destined to see at this inn more acquaintances than one.
On the day of Francis Ardry's departure, shortly after he had taken leave of me, as I was standing
in the corn-chamber, at a kind of writing-table or desk, fastened to the wall, with a book
before me, in which I was making out an account of the corn and hay lately received and distributed,
my friend the postillion came running in out of breath.  "Here they both are," he gasped out;
"pray do come and look at them."

"Whom do you mean?" said I.

"Why, that red-haired Jack Priest, and that idiotic parson, Platitude; they have just been
set down by one of the coaches, and want a postchaise to go across the country in; and what
do you think?  I am to have the driving of them.  I have no time to lose, for I must get myself
ready; so do come and look at them."

I hastened into the yard of the inn; two or three of the helpers of our establishment were
employed in drawing forward a postchaise out of the chaise-house, which occupied one side of
the yard, and which was spacious enough to contain nearly twenty of these vehicles, though
it was never full, several of them being always out upon the roads, as the demand upon us for
postchaises across the country was very great.  "There they are," said the postillion, softly,
nodding towards two individuals, in one of whom I recognized the man in black, and in the other
Mr. Platitude; "there they are; have a good look at them, while I go and get ready."  The man
in black and Mr. Platitude were walking up and down the yard, Mr. Platitude was doing his best
to make himself appear ridiculous, talking very loudly in exceedingly bad Italian, evidently
for the purpose of attracting the notice of the bystanders, in which he succeeded, all the
stable-boys and hangers-on about the yard, attracted by his vociferation, grinning at his ridiculous
figure as he limped up and down.  The man in black said little or nothing, but from the glances
which he cast sideways appeared to be thoroughly ashamed of his companion; the worthy couple
presently arrived close to where I was standing, and the man in black, who was nearest to me,
perceiving me, stood still as if hesitating, but recovering himself in a moment, he moved on
without taking any farther notice; Mr. Platitude exclaimed as they passed in broken lingo,
"I hope we shall find the holy doctors all assembled," and as they returned, "I make no doubt
that they will all be rejoiced to see me."  Not wishing to be standing an idle gazer, I went
to the chaise and assisted in attaching the horses, which had now been brought out, to the
pole.  The postillion presently arrived, and finding all ready took the reins and mounted the
box, whilst I very politely opened the door for the two travellers; Mr. Platitude got in first,
and, without taking any notice of me, seated himself on the farther side.  In got the man in
black, and seated himself nearest to me.  "All is right," said I, as I shut the door, whereupon
the postillion cracked his whip, and the chaise drove out of the yard.  Just as I shut the
door, however, and just as Mr. Platitude had recommenced talking in jergo, at the top of his
voice, the man in black turned his face partly towards me, and gave me a wink with his left eye.

I did not see my friend the postillion till the next morning, when he gave me an account of
the adventures he had met with on his expedition. It appeared that he had driven the man in
black and the Reverend Platitude across the country by roads and lanes which he had some difficulty
in threading.  At length, when he had reached a part of the country where he had never been
before, the man in black pointed out to him a house near the corner of a wood, to which he
informed him they were bound.  The postillion said it was a strange-looking house, with a wall
round it; and, upon the whole, bore something of the look of a madhouse. There was already
a postchaise at the gate, from which three individuals had alighted--one of them the postillion
said was a mean-looking scoundrel, with a regular petty-larceny expression in his countenance.
He was dressed very much like the man in black, and the postillion said that he could almost
have taken his Bible oath that they were both of the same profession.  The other two he said
were parsons, he could swear that, though he had never seen them before; there could be no
mistake about them.  Church of England parsons the postillion swore they were, with their black
coats, white cravats, and airs, in which clumsiness and conceit were most funnily blended--Church
of England parsons of the Platitude description, who had been in Italy, and seen the Pope,
and kissed his toe, and picked up a little broken Italian, and come home greater fools than
they went forth.  It appeared that they were all acquaintances of Mr. Platitude, for when the
postillion had alighted and let Mr. Platitude and his companion out of the chaise, Mr. Platitude
shook the whole three by the hand, conversed with his two brothers in a little broken jergo,
and addressed the petty-larceny looking individual by the title of Reverend Doctor.  In the
midst of these greetings, however, the postillion said the man in black came up to him, and
proceeded to settle with him for the chaise; he had shaken hands with nobody, and had merely
nodded to the others; "and now," said the postillion, "he evidently wished to get rid of me,
fearing, probably, that I should see too much of the nonsense that was going on.  It was whilst
settling with me that he seemed to recognize me for the first time, for he stared hard at me,
and at last asked whether I had not been in Italy; to which question, with a nod and a laugh,
I replied that I had.  I was then going to ask him about the health of the image of Holy Mary,
and to say that I hoped it had recovered from its horsewhipping; but he interrupted me, paid
me the money for the fare, and gave me a crown for myself, saying he would not detain me any
longer.  I say, partner, I am a poor postillion, but when he gave me the crown I had a good
mind to fling it in his face.  I reflected, however, that it was not mere gift-money, but coin
which I had earned, and hardly too, so I put it in my pocket, and I bethought me, moreover,
that, knave as I knew him to be, he had always treated me with civility; so I nodded to him,
and he said something which, perhaps, he meant for Latin, but which sounded very much like
'vails,' and by which he doubtless alluded to the money which he had given me.  He then went
into the house with the rest, the coach drove away which had brought the others, and I was
about to get on the box and follow; observing, however, two more chaises driving up, I thought
I would be in no hurry, so I just led my horses and chaise a little out of the way, and pretending
to be occupied about the harness, I kept a tolerably sharp look-out at the new arrivals.  Well,
partner, the next vehicle that drove up was a gentleman's carriage which I knew very well,
as well as those within it, who were a father and son, the father a good kind old gentleman,
and a justice of the peace, therefore not very wise, as you may suppose; the son a puppy who
has been abroad, where he contrived to forget his own language, though only nine months absent,
and now rules the roast over his father and mother, whose only child he is, and by whom he
is thought wondrous clever.  So this foreigneering chap brings his poor old father to this
out-of-the-way house to meet these Platitudes and petty-larceny villains, and perhaps would
have brought his mother too, only, simple thing, by good fortune she happens to be laid up
with the rheumatic.  Well, the father and son, I beg pardon, I mean the son and father, got
down and went in, and then after their carriage was gone, the chaise behind drove up, in which
was a huge fat fellow, weighing twenty stone at least, but with something of a foreign look,
and with him--who do you think?  Why, a rascally Unitarian minister, that is, a fellow who
had been such a minister, but who, some years ago leaving his own people, who had bred him
up and sent him to their college at York, went over to the High Church, and is now, I suppose,
going over to some other church, for he was talking, as he got down, wondrous fast in Latin,
or what sounded something like Latin, to the fat fellow, who appeared to take things wonderfully
easy, and merely grunted to the dog Latin which the scoundrel had learnt at the expense of
the poor Unitarians at York.  So they went into the house, and presently arrived another chaise,
but ere I could make any further observations, the porter of the out-of-the-way house came
up to me, asking what I was stopping there for? bidding me go away, and not pry into other
people's business. 'Pretty business,' said I to him, 'that is being transacted in a place like
this,' and then I was going to say something uncivil, but he went to attend to the new comers,
and I took myself away on my own business as he bade me, not, however, before observing that
these two last were a couple of blackcoats."

The postillion then proceeded to relate how he made the best of his way to a small public-house,
about a mile off, where he had intended to bait, and how he met on the way a landau and pair,
belonging to a Scotch coxcomb whom he had known in London, about whom he related some curious
particulars, and then continued: "Well, after I had passed him and his turn-out, I drove straight
to the public-house, where I baited my horses, and where I found some of the chaises and drivers
who had driven the folks to the lunatic-looking mansion, and were now waiting to take them
up again.  Whilst my horses were eating their bait, I sat me down, as the weather was warm,
at a table outside, and smoked a pipe, and drank some ale, in company with the coachman of
the old gentleman who had gone to the house with his son, and the coachman then told me that
the house was a Papist house, and that the present was a grand meeting of all the fools and
rascals in the country, who came to bow down to images, and to concert schemes--pretty schemes
no doubt--for overturning the religion of the country, and that for his part he did not approve
of being concerned with such doings, and that he was going to give his master warning next
day.  So, as we were drinking and discoursing, up drove the chariot of the Scotchman, and down
got his valet and the driver, and whilst the driver was seeing after the horses, the valet
came and sat down at the table where the gentleman's coachman and I were drinking.  I knew
the fellow well, a Scotchman like his master, and just of the same kidney, with white kid gloves,
red hair frizzled, a patch of paint on his face, and his hands covered with rings.  This very
fellow, I must tell you, was one of those most busy in endeavouring to get me turned out of
the servants' club in Park Lane, because I happened to serve a literary man; so he sat down,
and in a kind of affected tone cried out, 'Landlord, bring me a glass of cold negus.'  The
landlord, however, told him that there was no negus, but that if he pleased, he could have
a jug of as good beer as any in the country.  'Confound the beer,' said the valet, 'do you
think that I am accustomed to such vulgar beverage?'  However, as he found there was nothing
better to be had, he let the man bring him some beer, and when he had got it, soon showed that
he could drink it easily enough; so, when he had drunk two or three draughts, he turned his
eyes in a contemptuous manner, first, on the coachman, and then on me: I saw the scamp recollected
me, for after staring at me and my dress for about half a minute, he put on a broad grin, and
flinging his head back, he uttered a loud laugh.  Well, I did not like this, as you may well
believe, and taking the pipe out of my mouth, I asked him if he meant anything personal, to
which he answered, that he had said nothing to me, and that he had a right to look where he
pleased, and laugh when he pleased.  Well, as to a certain extent he was right, as to looking
and laughing; and as I have occasionally looked at a fool and laughed, though I was not the
fool in this instance, I put my pipe into my mouth and said no more.  This quiet and well-regulated
behaviour of mine, however, the fellow interpreted into fear; so, after drinking a little more,
he suddenly started up, and striding once or twice before the table, he asked me what I meant
by that impertinent question of mine, saying that he had a good mind to wring my nose for my
presumption.  'You have?' said I, getting up, and laying down my pipe.  'Well, I'll now give
you an opportunity.'  So I put myself in an attitude, and went up to him, saying 'I have an
old score to settle with you, you scamp; you wanted to get me turned out of the club, didn't
you?'  And thereupon, remembering that he had threatened to wring my nose, I gave him a snorter
upon his own.  I wish you could have seen the fellow when he felt the smart; so far from trying
to defend himself, he turned round, and with his hand to his face, attempted to run away; but
I was now in a regular passion, and following him up, got before him, and was going to pummel
away at him, when he burst into tears, and begged me not to hurt him, saying that he was sorry
if he had offended me, and that, if I pleased, he would go down on his knees, or do anything
else I wanted.  Well, when I heard him talk in this manner, I, of course, let him be; I could
hardly help laughing at the figure he cut; his face all blubbered with tears, and blood and
paint; but I did not laugh at the poor creature either, but went to the table and took up my
pipe, and smoked and drank as if nothing had happened; and the fellow, after having been to
the pump, came and sat down, crying, and trying to curry favour with me and the coachman; presently,
however, putting on a confidential look, he began to talk of the Popish house, and of the doings
there, and said he supposed as how we were of the party, and that it was all right; and then
he began to talk of the Pope of Rome, and what a nice man he was, and what a fine thing it
was to be of his religion, especially if folks went over to him; and how it advanced them in
the world, and gave them consideration; and how his master, who had been abroad and seen the
Pope, and kissed his toe, was going over to the Popish religion, and had persuaded him to consent
to do so, and to forsake his own, which I think the scoundrel called the 'Piscopal Church of
Scotland, and how many others of that church were going over, thinking to better their condition
in life by so doing, and to be more thought on; and how many of the English Church were thinking
of going over too--and that he had no doubt that it would all end right and comfortably.  Well,
as he was going on in this way, the old coachman began to spit, and getting up, flung all the
beer that was in his jug upon the ground, and going away, ordered another jug of beer, and
sat down at another table, saying that he would not drink in such company; and I too got up,
and flung what beer remained in my jug, there wasn't more than a drop, in the fellow's face,
saying, I would scorn to drink any more in such company; and then I went to my horses, put
them to, paid my reckoning, and drove home."

The postillion having related his story, to which I listened with all due attention, mused
for a moment, and then said, "I dare say you remember how, some time since, when old Bill had
been telling us how the Government a long time ago, had done away with robbing on the highway,
by putting down the public-houses and places which the highwaymen frequented, and by sending
a good mounted police to hunt them down, I said that it was a shame that the present Government
did not employ somewhat the same means in order to stop the proceedings of Mumbo Jumbo and
his gang now-a-days in England.  Howsomever, since I have driven a fare to a Popish rendezvous,
and seen something of what is going on there, I should conceive that the Government are justified
in allowing the gang the free exercise of their calling.  Anybody is welcome to stoop and pick
up nothing, or worse than nothing, and if Mumbo Jumbo's people, after their expeditions, return
to their haunts with no better plunder in the shape of converts than what I saw going into
yonder place of call, I should say they are welcome to what they get; for if that's the kind
of rubbish they steal out of the Church of England, or any other church, who in his senses
but would say a good riddance, and many thanks for your trouble: at any rate, that is my opinion
of the matter."

CHAPTER XXIX

Deliberations with Self-Resolution--Invitation to Dinner--The Commercial Traveller--The Landlord's
Offer--The Comet Wine.

It was now that I had frequent deliberations with myself.  Should I continue at the inn in
my present position?  I was not very much captivated with it; there was little poetry in keeping
an account of the corn, hay, and straw which came in, and was given out, and I was fond of
poetry; moreover, there was no glory at all to be expected in doing so, and I was fond of glory.
Should I give up that situation, and remaining at the inn, become ostler under old Bill?  There
was more poetry in rubbing down horses than in keeping an account of straw, hay, and corn;
there was also some prospect of glory attached to the situation of ostler, for the grooms and
stable-boys occasionally talked of an ostler, a great way down the road, who had been presented
by some sporting people, not with a silver vase, as our governor had been, but with a silver
currycomb, in testimony of their admiration for his skill; but I confess that the poetry of
rubbing down had become, as all other poetry becomes, rather prosy by frequent repetition,
and with respect to the chance of deriving glory from the employment, I entertained, in the
event of my determining to stay, very slight hope of ever attaining skill in the ostler art
sufficient to induce sporting people to bestow upon me a silver currycomb.  I was not half
so good an ostler as old Bill, who had never been presented with a silver currycomb, and I
never expected to become so, therefore what chance had I?  It was true, there was a prospect
of some pecuniary emolument to be derived by remaining in either situation.  It was very probable
that, provided I continued to keep an account of the hay and corn coming in and expended, the
landlord would consent to allow me a pound a week, which at the end of a dozen years, provided
I kept myself sober, would amount to a considerable sum.  I might, on the retirement of old
Bill, by taking his place, save up a decent sum of money, provided, unlike him, I kept myself
sober, and laid by all the shillings and sixpences I got; but the prospect of laying up a decent
sum of money was not of sufficient importance to induce me to continue either at my wooden
desk, or in the inn-yard.  The reader will remember what difficulty I had to make up my mind
to become a merchant under the Armenian's auspices, even with the prospect of making two or
three hundred thousand pounds by following the Armenian way of doing business, so it was not
probable that I should feel disposed to be a book- keeper or ostler all my life with no other
prospect than being able to make a tidy sum of money.  If indeed, besides the prospect of making
a tidy sum at the end of perhaps forty years' ostlering, I had been certain of being presented
with a silver currycomb with my name engraved upon it, which I might have left to my descendants,
or, in default thereof, to the parish church destined to contain my bones, with directions
that it might be soldered into the wall above the arch leading from the body of the church
into the chancel--I will not say with such a certainty of immortality, combined with such a
prospect of moderate pecuniary advantage,--I might not have thought it worth my while to stay,
but I entertained no such certainty, and, taking everything into consideration, I determined
to mount my horse and leave the inn.

This horse had caused me for some time past no little perplexity; I had frequently repented
of having purchased him, more especially as the purchase had been made with another person's
money, and had more than once shown him to people who, I imagined, were likely to purchase
him; but, though they were profuse in his praise, as people generally are in the praise of
what they don't intend to purchase, they never made me an offer, and now that I had determined
to mount on his back and ride away, what was I to do with him in the sequel?  I could not maintain
him long. Suddenly I bethought me of Horncastle, which Francis Ardry had mentioned as a place
where the horse was likely to find a purchaser, and not having determined upon any particular
place to which to repair, I thought that I could do no better than betake myself to Horncastle
in the first instance, and there endeavour to dispose of my horse.

On making inquiries with respect to the situation of Horncastle, and the time when the fair
would be held, I learned that the town was situated in Lincolnshire, about a hundred and fifty
miles from the inn at which I was at present sojourning, and that the fair would be held nominally
within about a month, but that it was always requisite to be on the spot some days before the
nominal day of the fair, as all the best horses were generally sold before that time, and the
people who came to purchase gone away with what they had bought.

The people of the inn were very sorry on being informed of my determination to depart.  Old
Bill told me that he had hoped as how I had intended to settle down there, and to take his
place as ostler when he was fit for no more work, adding, that though I did not know much of
the business, yet he had no doubt but that I might improve.  My friend the postillion was particularly
sorry, and taking me with him to the tap-room called for two pints of beer, to one of which
he treated me; and whilst we were drinking told me how particularly sorry he was at the thought
of my going, but that he hoped I should think better of the matter.  On my telling him that
I must go, he said that he trusted I should put off my departure for three weeks, in order
that I might be present at his marriage, the banns of which were just about to be published.
He said that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to see me dance a minuet with his
wife after the marriage dinner; but I told him it was impossible that I should stay, my affairs
imperatively calling me elsewhere; and that with respect to my dancing a minuet, such a thing
was out of the question, as I had never learned to dance.  At which he said that he was exceedingly
sorry, and finding me determined to go, wished me success in all my undertakings.

The master of the house, to whom, as in duty bound, I communicated my intention before I spoke
of it to the servants, was, I make no doubt, very sorry, though he did not exactly tell me
so.  What he said was, that he had never expected that I should remain long there, as such
a situation never appeared to him quite suitable to me, though I had been very diligent, and
had given him perfect satisfaction.  On his inquiring when I intended to depart, I informed
him next day, whereupon he begged that I would defer my departure till the next day but one,
and do him the favour of dining with him on the morrow.  I informed him that I should be only
too happy.

On the following day at four o'clock I dined with the landlord, in company with a commercial
traveller.  The dinner was good, though plain, consisting of boiled mackerel--rather a rarity
in those parts at that time--with fennel sauce, a prime baron of roast beef after the mackerel,
then a tart and noble Cheshire cheese; we had prime sherry at dinner, and whilst eating the
cheese prime porter, that of Barclay, the only good porter in the world.  After the cloth was
removed we had a bottle of very good port; and whilst partaking of the port I had an argument
with the commercial traveller on the subject of the corn-laws.

The commercial traveller, having worsted me in the argument on the subject of the corn-laws,
got up in great glee, saying that he must order his gig, as business must be attended to. 
Before leaving the room, however, he shook me patronizingly by the hand, and said something
to the master of the house, but in so low a tone that it escaped my ear.

No sooner had he departed than the master of the house told me that his friend the traveller
had just said that I was a confounded sensible young fellow, and not at all opinionated, a
sentiment in which he himself perfectly agreed--then hemming once or twice, he said that as
I was going on a journey he hoped I was tolerably well provided with money, adding that travelling
was rather expensive, especially on horseback, the manner in which he supposed, as I had a
horse in the stable, I intended to travel.  I told him that though I was not particularly well
supplied with money, I had sufficient for the expenses of my journey, at the end of which I
hoped to procure more.  He then hemmed again, and said that since I had been at the inn I had
rendered him a great deal of service in more ways than one, and that he should not think of
permitting me to depart without making me some remuneration; then putting his hand into his
waistcoat pocket, he handed me a cheque for ten pounds, which he had prepared beforehand, the
value of which he said I could receive at the next town, or that, if I wished it, any waiter
in the house would cash it for me.  I thanked him for his generosity in the best terms I could
select, but, handing him back the cheque, I told him that I could not accept it, saying, that,
so far from his being my debtor, I believed myself to be indebted to him, as not only myself
but my horse had been living at his house for several weeks.  He replied, that as for my board
at a house like his it amounted to nothing, and as for the little corn and hay which the horse
had consumed it was of no consequence, and that he must insist upon my taking the cheque. 
But I again declined, telling him that doing so would be a violation of a rule which I had
determined to follow, and which nothing but the greatest necessity would ever compel me to
break through--never to incur obligations.  "But," said he, "receiving this money will not
be incurring an obligation, it is your due."  "I do not think so," said I; "I did not engage
to serve you for money, nor will I take any from you."  "Perhaps you will take it as a loan?"
said he.  "No," I replied, "I never borrow."  "Well," said the landlord, smiling, "you are
different from all others that I am acquainted with.  I never yet knew any one else who scrupled
to borrow and receive obligations; why, there are two baronets in the neighbourhood who have
borrowed money of me, ay, and who have never repaid what they borrowed; and there are a dozen
squires who are under considerable obligations to me, who I dare say will never return them.
Come, you need not be more scrupulous than your superiors--I mean in station."  "Every vessel
must stand on its own bottom," said I; "they take pleasure in receiving obligations, I take
pleasure in being independent.  Perhaps they are wise, and I am a fool, I know not, but one
thing I am certain of, which is, that were I not independent I should be very unhappy: I should
have no visions then."  "Have you any relations?" said the landlord, looking at me compassionately;
"excuse me, but I don't think you are exactly fit to take care of yourself."  "There you are
mistaken," said I, "I can take precious good care of myself; ay, and can drive a precious hard
bargain when I have occasion, but driving bargains is a widely different thing from receiving
gifts.  I am going to take my horse to Horncastle, and when there I shall endeavour to obtain
his full value--ay to the last penny."

"Horncastle!" said the landlord, "I have heard of that place; you mustn't be dreaming visions
when you get there, or they'll steal the horse from under you.  Well," said he, rising, "I
shall not press you further on the subject of the cheque.  I intend, however, to put you under
an obligation to me."  He then rang the bell, and having ordered two fresh glasses to be brought,
he went out and presently returned with a small pint bottle, which he uncorked with his own
hand; then sitting down, he said, "The wine that I bring here, is port of eighteen hundred
and eleven, the year of the comet, the best vintage on record; the wine which we have been
drinking," he added, "is good, but not to be compared with this, which I never sell, and which
I am chary of.  When you have drunk some of it, I think you will own that I have conferred
an obligation upon you;" he then filled the glasses, the wine which he poured out diffusing
an aroma through the room; then motioning me to drink, he raised his own glass to his lips,
saying, "Come, friend, I drink to your success at Horncastle."

CHAPTER XXX

Triumphal Departure--No Season like Youth--Extreme Old Age--Beautiful England--The Ratcatcher--A
Misadventure.

I departed from the inn much in the same fashion as I had come to it, mounted on a splendid
horse indifferently well caparisoned, with the small valise attached to my crupper, in which,
besides the few things I had brought with me, was a small book of roads with a map which had
been presented to me by the landlord.  I must not forget to state that I did not ride out of
the yard, but that my horse was brought to me at the front door by old Bill, who insisted upon
doing so, and who refused a five-shilling piece which I offered him; and it will be as well
to let the reader know that the landlord shook me by the hand as I mounted, and that the people
attached to the inn, male and female--my friend the postillion at the head--assembled before
the house to see me off, and gave me three cheers as I rode away.  Perhaps no person ever departed
from an inn with more eclat or better wishes; nobody looked at me askance, except two stage-coachmen
who were loitering about, one of whom said to his companion, "I say, Jim! twig his portmanteau!
a regular Newmarket turn-out, by--!"

It was in the cool of the evening of a bright day--all the days of that summer were bright--that
I departed.  I felt at first rather melancholy at finding myself again launched into the wide
world, and leaving the friends whom I had lately made behind me; but by occasionally trotting
the horse, and occasionally singing a song of Romanvile, I had dispelled the feeling of melancholy
by the time I had proceeded three miles down the main road.  It was at the end of these three
miles, just opposite a milestone, that I struck into a cross road.  After riding about seven
miles, threading what are called, in postillion parlance, cross-country roads, I reached another
high road, tending to the east, along which I proceeded for a mile or two, when coming to a
small inn, about nine o'clock, I halted and put up for the night.

Early on the following morning I proceeded on my journey, but fearing to gall the horse, I
no longer rode him, but led him by the bridle, until I came to a town at the distance of about
ten miles from the place where I had passed the night.  Here I stayed during the heat of the
day, more on the horse's account than my own, and towards evening resumed my journey, leading
the animal by the bridle as before; and in this manner I proceeded for several days, travelling
on an average from twenty to twenty-five miles a day, always leading the animal, except perhaps
now and then of an evening, when, if I saw a good piece of road before me, I would mount and
put the horse into a trot, which the creature seemed to enjoy as much as myself, showing his
satisfaction by snorting and neighing, whilst I gave utterance to my own exhilaration by shouts,
or by "the chi she is kaulo she soves pre lakie dumo," or by something else of the same kind
in Romanvile.

On the whole, I journeyed along very pleasantly, certainly quite as pleasantly as I do at present,
now that I am become a gentleman and weigh sixteen stone, though some people would say that
my present manner of travelling is much the most preferable, riding as I now do, instead of
leading my horse; receiving the homage of ostlers instead of their familiar nods; sitting down
to dinner in the parlour of the best inn I can find, instead of passing the brightest part
of the day in the kitchen of a village alehouse; carrying on my argument after dinner on the
subject of the corn-laws, with the best commercial gentlemen on the road, instead of being
glad, whilst sipping a pint of beer, to get into conversation with blind trampers, or maimed
Abraham sailors, regaling themselves on half-pints at the said village hostelries.  Many people
will doubtless say that things have altered wonderfully with me for the better, and they would
say right, provided I possessed now what I then carried about with me in my journeys--the spirit
of youth.  Youth is the only season for enjoyment, and the first twenty-five years of one's
life are worth all the rest of the longest life of man, even though those five- and-twenty
be spent in penury and contempt, and the rest in the possession of wealth, honours, respectability,
ay, and many of them in strength and health, such as will enable one to ride forty miles before
dinner, and over one's pint of port--for the best gentleman in the land should not drink a
bottle--carry on one's argument, with gravity and decorum, with any commercial gentleman who,
responsive to one's challenge, takes the part of humanity and common sense against "protection"
and the lord of the land.

Ah! there is nothing like youth--not that after-life is valueless.  Even in extreme old age
one may get on very well, provided we will but accept of the bounties of God.  I met the other
day an old man, who asked me to drink.  "I am not thirsty," said I, "and will not drink with
you."  "Yes, you will," said the old man, "for I am this day one hundred years old; and you
will never again have an opportunity of drinking the health of a man on his hundredth birthday."
So I broke my word, and drank.  "Yours is a wonderful age," said I.  "It is a long time to
look back to the beginning of it," said the old man; "yet, upon the whole, I am not sorry to
have lived it all."  "How have you passed your time?" said I.  "As well as I could," said the
old man; "always enjoying a good thing when it came honestly within my reach; not forgetting
to praise God for putting it there."  "I suppose you were fond of a glass of good ale when
you were young?"  "Yes," said the old man, "I was; and so, thank God, I am still." And he drank
off a glass of ale.

On I went in my journey, traversing England from west to east--ascending and descending hills--crossing
rivers by bridge and ferry--and passing over extensive plains.  What a beautiful country is
England!  People run abroad to see beautiful countries, and leave their own behind unknown,
unnoticed--their own the most beautiful!  And then, again, what a country for adventures! especially
to those who travel on foot, or on horseback. People run abroad in quest of adventures, and
traverse Spain or Portugal on mule or on horseback; whereas there are ten times more adventures
to be met with in England than in Spain, Portugal, or stupid Germany to boot.  Witness the
number of adventures narrated in the present book--a book entirely devoted to England.  Why,
there is not a chapter in the present book which is not full of adventures, with the exception
of the present one, and this is not yet terminated.

After traversing two or three counties, I reached the confines of Lincolnshire.  During one
particularly hot day I put up at a public-house, to which, in the evening, came a party of
harvesters to make merry, who, finding me wandering about the house a stranger, invited me
to partake of their ale; so I drank with the harvesters, who sang me songs about rural life,
such as--

   "Sitting in the swale; and listening to the swindle of the flail, as
   it sounds dub-a-dub on the corn, from the neighbouring barn."

In requital for which I treated them with a song, not of Romanvile, but the song of "Sivory
and the horse Grayman."  I remained with them till it was dark, having, after sunset, entered
into deep discourse with a celebrated ratcatcher, who communicated to me the secrets of his
trade, saying, amongst other things, "When you see the rats pouring out of their holes, and
running up my hands and arms, it's not after me they comes, but after the oils I carries about
me they comes;" and who subsequently spoke in the most enthusiastic manner of his trade, saying
that it was the best trade in the world, and most diverting, and that it was likely to last
for ever; for whereas all other kinds of vermin were fast disappearing from England, rats were
every day becoming more abundant.  I had quitted this good company, and having mounted my horse,
was making my way towards a town at about six miles' distance, at a swinging trot, my thoughts
deeply engaged on what I had gathered from the ratcatcher, when all on a sudden a light glared
upon the horse's face, who purled round in great terror, and flung me out of the saddle, as
from a sling, or with as much violence as the horse Grayman, in the ballad, flings Sivord the
Snareswayne.  I fell upon the ground--felt a kind of crashing about my neck--and forthwith
became senseless.

CHAPTER XXXI

A Novel Situation--The Elderly Individual--The Surgeon--A Kind Offer--Chimerical Ideas--Strange
Dream.

How long I remained senseless I cannot say, for a considerable time, I believe; at length,
opening my eyes, I found myself lying on a bed in a middle-sized chamber, lighted by a candle,
which stood on a table--an elderly man stood near me, and a yet more elderly female was holding
a phial of very pungent salts to my olfactory organ.  I attempted to move, but felt very stiff--my
right arm appeared nearly paralysed, and there was a strange dull sensation in my head.  "You
had better remain still, young man," said the elderly individual, "the surgeon will be here
presently; I have sent a message for him to the neighbouring village." "Where am I?" said I,
"and what has happened?"  "You are in my house," said the old man, "and you have been flung
from a horse.  I am sorry to say that I was the cause.  As I was driving home, the lights in
my gig frightened the animal."  "Where is the horse?" said I.  "Below, in my stable," said
the elderly individual.  "I saw you fall, but knowing that on account of my age I could be
of little use to you, I instantly hurried home, the accident did not occur more than a furlong
off, and procuring the assistance of my lad, and two or three neighbouring cottagers, I returned
to the spot where you were lying senseless.  We raised you up, and brought you here.  My lad
then went in quest of the horse, who had run away as we drew nigh.  When we saw him first he
was standing near you; he caught him with some difficulty, and brought him home.  What are
you about?" said the old man, as I strove to get off the bed.  "I want to see the horse," said
I.  "I entreat you to be still," said the old man; "the horse is safe, I assure you."  "I am
thinking about his knees," said I.  "Instead of thinking about your horse's knees," said the
old man, "be thankful that you have not broke your own neck."  "You do not talk wisely," said
I; "when a man's neck is broke, he is provided for; but when his horse's knees are broke, he
is a lost jockey, that is, if he has nothing but his horse to depend upon.  A pretty figure
I should cut at Horncastle, mounted on a horse blood-raw at the knees."  "Oh, you are going
to Horncastle," said the old man, seriously, "then I can sympathize with you in your anxiety
about your horse, being a Lincolnshire man, and the son of one who bred horses.  I will myself
go down into the stable, and examine into the condition of your horse, so pray remain quiet
till I return; it would certainly be a terrible thing to appear at Horncastle on a broken-kneed
horse."

He left the room and returned in about ten minutes, followed by another person.  "Your horse
is safe," said he, "and his knees are unblemished; not a hair ruffled.  He is a fine animal,
and will do credit to Horncastle; but here is the surgeon come to examine into your own condition."
The surgeon was a man about thirty-five, thin, and rather tall; his face was long and pale,
and his hair, which was light, was carefully combed back as much as possible from his forehead.
He was dressed very neatly, and spoke in a very precise tone.  "Allow me to feel your pulse,
friend?" said he, taking me by the right wrist.  I uttered a cry, for at the motion which he
caused a thrill of agony darted through my arm.  "I hope your arm is not broke, my friend,"
said the surgeon, "allow me to see; first of all, we must divest you of this cumbrous frock."

The frock was removed with some difficulty, and then the upper vestments of my frame, with
more difficulty still.  The surgeon felt my arm, moving it up and down, causing me unspeakable
pain.  "There is no fracture," said he, at last, "but a contusion--a violent contusion.  I
am told you were going to Horncastle; I am afraid you will be hardly able to ride your horse
thither in time to dispose of him; however, we shall see--your arm must be bandaged, friend;
after which I shall bleed you, and administer a composing draught."

To be short, the surgeon did as he proposed, and when he had administered the composing draught,
he said, "Be of good cheer; I should not be surprised if you are yet in time for Horncastle."
He then departed with the master of the house, and the woman, leaving me to my repose.  I soon
began to feel drowsy, and was just composing myself to slumber, lying on my back, as the surgeon
had advised me, when I heard steps ascending the stairs, and in a moment more the surgeon entered
again, followed by the master of the house.  "I hope I don't disturb you," said the former;
"my reason for returning is to relieve your mind from any anxiety with respect to your horse.
I am by no means sure that you will be able, owing to your accident, to reach Horncastle in
time: to quiet you, however, I will buy your horse for any reasonable sum.  I have been down
to the stable, and approve of his figure.  What do you ask for him?" "This is a strange time
of night," said I, "to come to me about purchasing my horse, and I am hardly in a fitting situation
to be applied to about such a matter.  What do you want him for?"  "For my own use," said the
surgeon; "I am a professional man, and am obliged to be continually driving about; I cover
at least one hundred and fifty miles every week."  "He will never answer your purpose," said
I, "he is not a driving horse, and was never between shafts in his life; he is for riding,
more especially for trotting, at which he has few equals."  "It matters not to me whether he
is for riding or driving," said the surgeon, "sometimes I ride, sometimes drive; so, if we
can come to terms, I will buy him, though remember it is chiefly to remove any anxiety from
your mind about him."  "This is no time for bargaining," said I, "if you wish to have the horse
for a hundred guineas, you may; if not--"  "A hundred guineas!" said the surgeon, "my good
friend, you must surely be light- headed; allow me to feel your pulse," and he attempted to
feel my left wrist.  "I am not light-headed," said I, "and I require no one to feel my pulse;
but I should be light-headed if I were to sell my horse for less than I have demanded; but
I have a curiosity to know what you would be willing to offer."  "Thirty pounds," said the
surgeon, "is all I can afford to give; and that is a great deal for a country surgeon to offer
for a horse."  "Thirty pounds!" said I, "why, he cost me nearly double that sum.  To tell you
the truth, I am afraid that you want to take advantage of my situation."  "Not in the least,
friend," said the surgeon, "not in the least; I only wished to set your mind at rest about
your horse; but as you think he is worth more than I can afford to offer, take him to Horncastle
by all means; I will do my best to cure you in time.  Good night, I will see you again on the
morrow."  Thereupon he once more departed with the master of the house.  "A sharp one," I heard
him say, with a laugh, as the door closed upon him.

Left to myself, I again essayed to compose myself to rest, but for some time in vain.  I had
been terribly shaken by my fall, and had subsequently, owing to the incision of the surgeon's
lancet, been deprived of much of the vital fluid; it is when the body is in such a state that
the merest trifles affect and agitate the mind; no wonder, then, that the return of the surgeon
and the master of the house for the purpose of inquiring whether I would sell my horse, struck
me as being highly extraordinary, considering the hour of the night, and the situation in which
they knew me to be.  What could they mean by such conduct--did they wish to cheat me of the
animal?  "Well, well," said I, "if they did, what matters, they found their match; yes, yes,"
said I, "but I am in their power, perhaps"--but I instantly dismissed the apprehension which
came into my mind, with a pooh, nonsense!  In a little time, however, a far more foolish and
chimerical idea began to disturb me--the idea of being flung from my horse; was I not disgraced
for ever as a horseman by being flung from my horse?  Assuredly, I thought; and the idea of
being disgraced as a horseman, operating on my nervous system, caused me very acute misery.
"After all," said I to myself, "it was perhaps the contemptible opinion which the surgeon must
have formed of my equestrian powers, which induced him to offer to take my horse off my hands;
he perhaps thought I was unable to manage a horse, and therefore in pity returned in the dead
of night to offer to purchase the animal which had flung me;" and then the thought that the
surgeon had conceived a contemptible opinion of my equestrian powers, caused me the acutest
misery, and continued tormenting me until some other idea (I have forgot what it was, but doubtless
equally foolish) took possession of my mind.  At length, brought on by the agitation of my
spirits, there came over me the same feeling of horror that I had experienced of old when I
was a boy, and likewise of late within the dingle; it was, however, not so violent as it had
been on those occasions, and I struggled manfully against it, until by degrees it passed away,
and then I fell asleep; and in my sleep I had an ugly dream.  I dreamt that I had died of the
injuries I had received from my fall, and that no sooner had my soul departed from my body
than it entered that of a quadruped, even my own horse in the stable--in a word, I was, to
all intents and purposes, my own steed; and as I stood in the stable chewing hay (and I remember
that the hay was exceedingly tough), the door opened, and the surgeon who had attended me came
in.  "My good animal," said he, "as your late master has scarcely left enough to pay for the
expenses of his funeral, and nothing to remunerate me for my trouble, I shall make bold to
take possession of you.  If your paces are good, I shall keep you for my own riding; if not,
I shall take you to Horncastle, your original destination."  He then bridled and saddled me,
and, leading me out, mounted, and then trotted me up and down before the house, at the door
of which the old man, who now appeared to be dressed in regular jockey fashion, was standing.
"I like his paces well," said the surgeon; "I think I shall take him for my own use."  "And
what am I to have for all the trouble his master caused me?" said my late entertainer, on whose
countenance I now observed, for the first time, a diabolical squint.  "The consciousness of
having done your duty to a fellow-creature in succouring him in a time of distress, must be
your reward," said the surgeon.  "Pretty gammon, truly," said my late entertainer; "what would
you say if I were to talk in that way to you? Come, unless you choose to behave jonnock, I
shall take the bridle and lead the horse back into the stable."  "Well," said the surgeon,
"we are old friends, and I don't wish to dispute with you, so I'll tell you what I will do;
I will ride the animal to Horncastle, and we will share what he fetches like brothers."  "Good,"
said the old man, "but if you say that you have sold him for less than a hundred, I shan't
consider you jonnock; remember what the young fellow said--that young fellow--"  I heard no
more, for the next moment I found myself on a broad road leading, as I supposed, in the direction
of Horncastle, the surgeon still in the saddle, and my legs moving at a rapid trot.  "Get on,"
said the surgeon, jerking my mouth with the bit; whereupon, full of rage, I instantly set off
at a full gallop, determined, if possible, to dash my rider to the earth.  The surgeon, however,
kept his seat, and, so far from attempting to abate my speed, urged me on to greater efforts
with a stout stick, which methought he held in his hand.  In vain did I rear and kick, attempting
to get rid of my foe; but the surgeon remained as saddle- fast as ever the Maugrabin sorcerer
in the Arabian tale what time he rode the young prince transformed into a steed to his enchanted
palace in the wilderness.  At last, as I was still madly dashing on, panting and blowing, and
had almost given up all hope, I saw at a distance before me a heap of stones by the side of
the road, probably placed there for the purpose of repairing it; a thought appeared to strike
me--I will shy at those stones, and, if I can't get rid of him so, resign myself to my fate.
So I increased my speed, till arriving within about ten yards of the heap, I made a desperate
start, turning half round with nearly the velocity of a mill-stone.  Oh, the joy I experienced
when I felt my enemy canted over my neck, and saw him lying senseless in the road.  "I have
you now in my power," I said, or rather neighed, as, going up to my prostrate foe, I stood
over him.  "Suppose I were to rear now, and let my fore feet fall upon you, what would your
life be worth? that is, supposing you are not killed already; but lie there, I will do you
no further harm, but trot to Horncastle without a rider, and when there--" and without further
reflection off I trotted in the direction of Horncastle, but had not gone far before my bridle,
falling from my neck, got entangled with my off fore foot.  I felt myself falling, a thrill
of agony shot through me--my knees would be broken, and what should I do at Horncastle with
a pair of broken knees?  I struggled, but I could not disengage my off fore foot, and downward
I fell, but before I had reached the ground I awoke, and found myself half out of bed, my bandaged
arm in considerable pain, and my left hand just touching the floor.

With some difficulty I readjusted myself in bed.  It was now early morning, and the first rays
of the sun were beginning to penetrate the white curtains of a window on my left, which probably
looked into the garden, as I caught a glimpse or two of the leaves of trees through a small
uncovered part at the side.  For some time I felt uneasy and anxious, my spirits being in a
strange fluttering state.  At last my eyes fell upon a small row of tea-cups seemingly of china,
which stood on a mantelpiece exactly fronting the bottom of the bed.  The sight of these objects,
I know not why, soothed and pacified me; I kept my eyes fixed upon them, as I lay on my back
on the bed, with my head upon the pillow, till at last I fell into a calm and refreshing sleep.

CHAPTER XXXII

The Morning after a Fall--The Teapot--Unpretending Hospitality--The Chinese Student.

It might be about eight o'clock in the morning when I was awakened by the entrance of the old
man.  "How have you rested?" said he, coming up to the bedside, and looking me in the face.
"Well," said I, "and I feel much better, but I am still very sore."  I surveyed him now for
the first time with attention.  He was dressed in a sober-coloured suit, and was apparently
between sixty and seventy.  In stature he was rather above the middle height, but with a slight
stoop; his features were placid, and expressive of much benevolence, but, as it appeared to
me, with rather a melancholy cast--as I gazed upon them, I felt ashamed that I should ever
have conceived in my brain a vision like that of the preceding night, in which he appeared
in so disadvantageous a light.  At length he said, "It is now time for you to take some refreshment.
I hear my old servant coming up with your breakfast."  In a moment the elderly female entered
with a tray, on which was some bread and butter, a teapot and cup.  The cup was of common blue
earthenware, but the pot was of china, curiously fashioned, and seemingly of great antiquity.
The old man poured me out a cupful of tea, and then, with the assistance of the woman, raised
me higher, and propped me up with the pillows.  I ate and drank; when the pot was emptied of
its liquid (it did not contain much), I raised it up with my left hand to inspect it.  The
sides were covered with curious characters, seemingly hieroglyphics.  After surveying them
for some time, I replaced it upon the tray.  "You seem fond of china," said I, to the old man,
after the servant had retired with the breakfast things, and I had returned to my former posture;
"you have china on the mantelpiece, and that was a remarkable teapot out of which I have just
been drinking."

The old man fixed his eyes intently on me, and methought the expression of his countenance
became yet more melancholy.  "Yes," said he, at last, "I am fond of china--I have reason to
be fond of china--but for china I should--" and here he sighed again.

"You value it for the quaintness and singularity of its form," said I; "it appears to be less
adapted for real use than our own pottery."

"I care little about its form," said the old man; "I care for it simply on account of--however,
why talk to you on the subject which can have no possible interest to you?  I expect the surgeon
here presently."

"I do not like that surgeon at all," said I; "how strangely he behaved last night, coming back,
when I was just falling asleep, to ask me if I would sell my horse."

The old man smiled.  "He has but one failing," said he, "an itch for horse-dealing; but for
that he might be a much richer man than he is; he is continually buying and exchanging horses,
and generally finds himself a loser by his bargains: but he is a worthy creature, and skilful
in his profession--it is well for you that you are under his care."

The old man then left me, and in about an hour returned with the surgeon, who examined me and
reported favourably as to my case.  He spoke to me with kindness and feeling, and did not introduce
the subject of the horse.  I asked him whether he thought I should be in time for the fair.
"I saw some people making their way thither to-day," said he; "the fair lasts three weeks,
and it has just commenced.  Yes, I think I may promise you that you will be in time for the
very heat of it.  In a few days you will be able to mount your saddle with your arm in a sling,
but you must by no means appear with your arm in a sling at Horncastle, as people would think
that your horse had flung you, and that you wanted to dispose of him because he was a vicious
brute.  You must, by all means, drop the sling before you get to Horncastle."

For three days I kept my apartment by the advice of the surgeon.  I passed my time as I best
could.  Stretched on my bed, I either abandoned myself to reflection, or listened to the voices
of the birds in the neighbouring garden.  Sometimes, as I lay awake at night, I would endeavour
to catch the tick of a clock, which methought sounded from some distant part of the house.

The old man visited me twice or thrice every day to inquire into my state.  His words were
few on these occasions, and he did not stay long. Yet his voice and his words were kind.  What
surprised me most in connection with this individual was, the delicacy of conduct which he
exhibited in not letting a word proceed from his lips which could testify curiosity respecting
who I was, or whence I came.  All he knew of me was, that I had been flung from my horse on
my way to a fair for the purpose of disposing of the animal; and that I was now his guest.
I might be a common horse-dealer for what he knew, yet I was treated by him with all the attention
which I could have expected, had I been an alderman of Boston's heir, and known to him as such.
The county in which I am now, thought I at last, must be either extraordinarily devoted to
hospitality, or this old host of mine must be an extraordinary individual.  On the evening
of the fourth day, feeling tired of my confinement, I put my clothes on in the best manner
I could, and left the chamber.  Descending a flight of stairs, I reached a kind of quadrangle,
from which branched two or three passages; one of these I entered, which had a door at the
farther end, and one on each side; the one to the left standing partly open, I entered it,
and found myself in a middle-sized room with a large window, or rather glass-door, which looked
into a garden, and which stood open.  There was nothing remarkable in this room, except a large
quantity of china.  There was china on the mantelpiece--china on two tables, and a small beaufet,
which stood opposite the glass-door, was covered with china--there were cups, teapots, and
vases of various forms, and on all of them I observed characters--not a teapot, not a tea-cup,
not a vase of whatever form or size, but appeared to possess hieroglyphics on some part or
other.  After surveying these articles for some time with no little interest, I passed into
the garden, in which there were small parterres of flowers, and two or three trees, and which,
where the house did not abut, was bounded by a wall; turning to the right by a walk by the
side of a house, I passed by a door--probably the one I had seen at the end of the passage--and
arrived at another window similar to that through which I had come, and which also stood open;
I was about to pass through it, when I heard the voice of my entertainer exclaiming, "Is that
you? pray come in."

I entered the room, which seemed to be a counterpart of the one which I had just left.  It
was of the same size, had the same kind of furniture, and appeared to be equally well stocked
with china; one prominent article it possessed, however, which the other room did not exhibit--namely,
a clock, which, with its pendulum moving tick-a-tick, hung against the wall opposite to the
door, the sight of which made me conclude that the sound which methought I had heard in the
stillness of the night was not an imaginary one.  There it hung on the wall, with its pendulum
moving tick- a-tick.  The old gentleman was seated in an easy chair a little way into the room,
having the glass-door on his right hand.  On a table before him lay a large open volume, in
which I observed Roman letters as well as characters.  A few inches beyond the book on the
table, covered all over with hieroglyphics, stood a china vase.  The eyes of the old man were
fixed upon it.

"Sit down," said he, motioning me with his hand to a stool close by, but without taking his
eyes from the vase.

"I can't make it out," said he, at last, removing his eyes from the vase, and leaning back
on the chair, "I can't make it out."

"I wish I could assist you," said I.

"Assist me," said the old man, looking at me with a half smile.

"Yes," said I, "but I don't understand Chinese."

"I suppose not," said the old man, with another slight smile; "but--but--"

"Pray proceed," said I.

"I wished to ask you," said the old man, "how you knew that the characters on yon piece of
crockery were Chinese; or, indeed, that there was such a language?"

"I knew the crockery was china," said I, "and naturally enough supposed what was written upon
it to be Chinese; as for there being such a language--the English have a language, the French
have a language, and why not the Chinese?"

"May I ask you a question?"

"As many as you like."

"Do you know any language besides English?"

"Yes," said I, "I know a little of two or three."

"May I ask their names?"

"Why not?" said I, "I know a little French."

"Anything else?"

"Yes, a little Welsh, and a little Haik."

"What is Haik?"

"Armenian."

"I am glad to see you in my house," said the old man, shaking me by the hand; "how singular
that one coming as you did should know Armenian!"

"Not more singular," said I, "than that one living in such a place as this should know Chinese.
How came you to acquire it?"

The old man looked at me, and sighed.  "I beg pardon," said I, "for asking what is, perhaps,
an impertinent question; I have not imitated your own delicacy; you have never asked me a question
without first desiring permission, and here I have been days and nights in your house an intruder
on your hospitality, and you have never so much as asked me who I am."

"In forbearing to do that," said the old man, "I merely obeyed the Chinese precept, 'Ask no
questions of a guest;' it is written on both sides of the teapot out of which you have had
your tea."

"I wish I knew Chinese," said I.  "Is it a difficult language to acquire?"

"I have reason to think so," said the old man.  "I have been occupied upon it five-and-thirty
years, and I am still very imperfectly acquainted with it; at least, I frequently find upon
my crockery sentences the meaning of which to me is very dark, though it is true these sentences
are mostly verses, which are, of course, more difficult to understand than mere prose."

"Are your Chinese studies," said I, "confined to crockery literature?"

"Entirely," said the old man; "I read nothing else."

"I have heard," said I, "that the Chinese have no letters, but that for every word they have
a separate character--is it so?"

"For every word they have a particular character," said the old man; "though, to prevent confusion,
they have arranged their words under two hundred and fourteen what we should call radicals,
but which they call keys.  As we arrange all our words in a dictionary under twenty-four letters,
so do they arrange all their words, or characters, under two hundred and fourteen radical signs;
the simplest radicals being the first, and the more complex the last."

"Does the Chinese resemble any of the European languages in words?" said I.

"I am scarcely competent to inform you," said the old man; "but I believe not."

"What does that character represent?" said I, pointing to one on the vase.

"A knife," said the old man, "that character is one of the simplest radicals or keys."

"And what is the sound of it?" said I.

"Tau," said the old man.

"Tau!" said I; "tau!"

"A strange word for a knife is it not?" said the old man.

"Tawse!" said I; "tawse!"

"What is tawse?" said the old man.

"You were never at school at Edinburgh, I suppose?"

"Never," said the old man.

"That accounts for your not knowing the meaning of tawse," said I; "had you received the rudiments
of a classical education at the High School, you would have known the meaning of tawse full
well.  It is a leathern thong, with which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of their
duty by the dominie.  Tau--tawse--how singular!"

"I cannot see what the two words have in common, except a slight agreement in sound."

"You will see the connection," said I, "when I inform you that the thong, from the middle to
the bottom, is cut or slit into two or three parts, from which slits or cuts, unless I am very
much mistaken, it derives its name--tawse, a thong with slits or cuts, used for chastising
disorderly urchins at the High School, from the French tailler, to cut; evidently connected
with the Chinese tau, a knife--how very extraordinary!"

CHAPTER XXXIII

Convalescence--The Surgeon's Bill--Letter of Recommendation--Commencement of the Old Man's History.

Two days--three days passed away--and I still remained at the house of my hospitable entertainer;
my bruised limb rapidly recovering the power of performing its functions.  I passed my time
agreeably enough, sometimes in my chamber, communing with my own thoughts; sometimes in the
stable, attending to, and not unfrequently conversing with, my horse; and at meal- time--for
I seldom saw him at any other--discoursing with the old gentleman, sometimes on the Chinese
vocabulary, sometimes on Chinese syntax, and once or twice on English horseflesh; though on
this latter subject, notwithstanding his descent from a race of horse-traders, he did not enter
into with much alacrity.  As a small requital for his kindness, I gave him one day, after dinner,
unasked, a brief account of my history and pursuits.  He listened with attention; and when
it was concluded, thanked me for the confidence which I had reposed in him.  "Such conduct,"
said he, "deserves a return.  I will tell you my own history; it is brief, but may perhaps
not prove uninteresting to you--though the relation of it will give me some pain."  "Pray,
then, do not recite it," said I.  "Yes," said the old man, "I will tell you, for I wish you
to know it."  He was about to begin, when he was interrupted by the arrival of the surgeon.
The surgeon examined into the state of my bruised limb, and told me, what indeed I already
well knew, that it was rapidly improving.  "You will not even require a sling," said he, "to
ride to Horncastle.  When do you propose going?" he demanded.  "When do you think I may venture?"
I replied.  "I think, if you are a tolerably good horseman, you may mount the day after to-morrow,"
answered the medical man.  "By-the-bye, are you acquainted with anybody at Horncastle?" "With
no living soul," I answered.  "Then you would scarcely find stable-room for your horse.  But
I am happy to be able to assist you.  I have a friend there who keeps a small inn, and who,
during the time of the fair, keeps a stall vacant for any quadruped I may bring, until he knows
whether I am coming or not.  I will give you a letter to him, and he will see after the accommodation
of your horse.  To-morrow I will pay you a farewell visit, and bring you the letter."  "Thank
you," said I; "and do not forget to bring your bill."  The surgeon looked at the old man, who
gave him a peculiar nod.  "Oh!" said he, in reply to me, "for the little service I have rendered
you, I require no remuneration.  You are in my friend's house, and he and I understand each
other."  "I never receive such favours," said I, "as you have rendered me, without remunerating
them; therefore I shall expect your bill."  "Oh! just as you please," said the surgeon; and
shaking me by the hand more warmly than he had hitherto done, he took his leave.

On the evening of the next day, the last which I spent with my kind entertainer, I sat at tea
with him in a little summer-house in his garden, partially shaded by the boughs of a large
fig-tree.  The surgeon had shortly before paid me his farewell visit, and had brought me the
letter of introduction to his friend at Horncastle, and also his bill, which I found anything
but extravagant.  After we had each respectively drank the contents of two cups--and it may
not be amiss here to inform the reader that though I took cream with my tea, as I always do
when I can procure that addition, the old man, like most people bred up in the country, drank
his without it--he thus addressed me:--"I am, as I told you on the night of your accident,
the son of a breeder of horses, a respectable and honest man.  When I was about twenty he died,
leaving me, his only child, a comfortable property, consisting of about two hundred acres of
land and some fifteen hundred pounds in money.  My mother had died about three years previously.
I felt the death of my mother keenly, but that of my father less than was my duty; indeed,
truth compels me to acknowledge that I scarcely regretted his death.  The cause of this want
of proper filial feeling was the opposition which I had experienced from him in an affair which
deeply concerned me.  I had formed an attachment for a young female in the neighbourhood, who,
though poor, was of highly respectable birth, her father having been a curate of the Established
Church.  She was, at the time of which I am speaking, an orphan, having lost both her parents,
and supported herself by keeping a small school. My attachment was returned, and we had pledged
our vows, but my father, who could not reconcile himself to her lack of fortune, forbade our
marriage in the most positive terms.  He was wrong, for she was a fortune in herself--amiable
and accomplished.  Oh! I cannot tell you all she was--" and here the old man drew his hand
across his eyes.  "By the death of my father, the only obstacle to our happiness appeared to
be removed. We agreed, therefore, that our marriage should take place within the course of
a year; and I forthwith commenced enlarging my house and getting my affairs in order.  Having
been left in the easy circumstances which I have described, I determined to follow no business,
but to pass my life in a strictly domestic manner, and to be very, very happy. Amongst other
property derived from my father were several horses, which I disposed of in this neighbourhood,
with the exception of two remarkably fine ones, which I determined to take to the next fair
at Horncastle, the only place where I expected to be able to obtain what I considered to be
their full value.  At length the time arrived for the commencement of the fair, which was within
three months of the period which my beloved and myself had fixed upon for the celebration of
our nuptials.  To the fair I went, a couple of trusty men following me with the horses.  I
soon found a purchaser for the animals, a portly, plausible person, of about forty, dressed
in a blue riding coat, brown top boots, and leather breeches. There was a strange-looking urchin
with him, attired in nearly similar fashion, with a beam in one of his eyes, who called him
father.  The man paid me for the purchase in bank-notes--three fifty-pound notes for the two
horses.  As we were about to take leave of each other, he suddenly produced another fifty-pound
note, inquiring whether I could change it, complaining, at the same time, of the difficulty
of procuring change in the fair.  As I happened to have plenty of small money in my possession,
and as I felt obliged to him for having purchased my horses at what I considered to be a good
price, I informed him that I should be very happy to accommodate him; so I changed him the
note, and he, having taken possession of the horses, went his way, and I myself returned home.

"A month passed; during this time I paid away two of the notes which I had received at Horncastle
from the dealer--one of them in my immediate neighbourhood, and the other at a town about fifteen
miles distant, to which I had repaired for the purpose of purchasing some furniture.  All things
seemed to be going on most prosperously, and I felt quite happy, when one morning, as I was
overlooking some workmen who were employed about my house, I was accosted by a constable, who
informed me that he was sent to request my immediate appearance before a neighbouring bench
of magistrates.  Concluding that I was merely summoned on some unimportant business connected
with the neighbourhood, I felt no surprise, and forthwith departed in company with the officer.
The demeanour of the man upon the way struck me as somewhat singular.  I had frequently spoken
to him before, and had always found him civil and respectful, but he was now reserved and sullen,
and replied to two or three questions which I put to him in anything but a courteous manner.
On arriving at the place where the magistrates were sitting--an inn at a small town about two
miles distant--I found a more than usual number of people assembled, who appeared to be conversing
with considerable eagerness.  At sight of me they became silent, but crowded after me as I
followed the man into the magistrates' room.  There I found the tradesman to whom I had paid
the note for the furniture at the town fifteen miles off in attendance, accompanied by an agent
of the Bank of England; the former, it seems, had paid the note into a provincial bank, the
proprietors of which, discovering it to be a forgery, had forthwith written up to the Bank
of England, who had sent down their agent to investigate the matter.  A third individual stood
beside them--the person in my own immediate neighbourhood to whom I had paid the second note;
this, by some means or other, before the coming down of the agent, had found its way to the
same provincial bank, and also being pronounced a forgery, it had speedily been traced to the
person to whom I had paid it. It was owing to the apparition of this second note that the agent
had determined, without further inquiry, to cause me to be summoned before the rural tribunal.

"In a few words the magistrates' clerk gave me to understand the state of the case.  I was
filled with surprise and consternation.  I knew myself to be perfectly innocent of any fraudulent
intention, but at the time of which I am speaking it was a matter fraught with the greatest
danger to be mixed up, however innocently, with the passing of false money.  The law with respect
to forgery was terribly severe, and the innocent as well as the guilty occasionally suffered.
Of this I was not altogether ignorant; unfortunately, however, in my transactions with the
stranger, the idea of false notes being offered to me, and my being brought into trouble by
means of them, never entered my mind.  Recovering myself a little, I stated that the notes
in question were two of three notes which I had received at Horncastle, for a pair of horses,
which it was well known I had carried thither.

"Thereupon, I produced from my pocket-book the third note, which was forthwith pronounced a
forgery.  I had scarcely produced the third note, when I remembered the one which I had changed
for the Horncastle dealer, and with the remembrance came the almost certain conviction that
it was also a forgery; I was tempted for a moment to produce it, and to explain the circumstance--would
to God I had done so!--but shame at the idea of having been so wretchedly duped prevented me,
and the opportunity was lost.  I must confess that the agent of the bank behaved, upon the
whole, in a very handsome manner; he said that as it was quite evident that I had disposed
of certain horses at the fair, it was very probable that I might have received the notes in
question in exchange for them, and that he was willing, as he had received a very excellent
account of my general conduct, to press the matter no farther, that is, provided--"  And here
he stopped.  Thereupon, one of the three magistrates, who were present, asked me whether I
chanced to have any more of these spurious notes in my possession.  He certainly had a right
to ask the question; but there was something peculiar in his tone-insinuating suspicion.  It
is certainly difficult to judge of the motives which rule a person's conduct, but I cannot
help imagining that he was somewhat influenced in his behaviour on that occasion, which was
anything but friendly, by my having refused to sell him the horses at a price less than that
which I expected to get at the fair; be this as it may, the question filled me with embarrassment,
and I bitterly repented not having at first been more explicit.  Thereupon the magistrate in
the same kind of tone, demanded to see my pocket-book. I knew that to demur would be useless,
and produced it, and therewith, amongst two or three small country notes, appeared the fourth
which I had received from the Horncastle dealer.  The agent took it up and examined it with
attention.  'Well, is it a genuine note?' asked the magistrate. 'I am sorry to say that it
is not,' said the agent; 'it is a forgery, like the other three.'  The magistrate shrugged
his shoulders, as indeed did several people in the room.  'A regular dealer in forged notes,'
said a person close behind me; 'who would have thought it?'

"Seeing matters begin to look so serious, I aroused myself, and endeavoured to speak in my
own behalf, giving a candid account of the manner in which I became possessed of the notes;
but my explanation did not appear to meet much credit; the magistrate, to whom I have in particular
alluded, asked, why I had not at once stated the fact of my having received a fourth note;
and the agent, though in a very quiet tone, observed that he could not help thinking it somewhat
strange that I should have changed a note of so much value for a perfect stranger, even supposing
that he had purchased my horses, and had paid me their value in hard cash; and I noticed that
he laid particular emphasis on the last words.  I might have observed that I was an inexperienced
young man, who, meaning no harm myself, suspected none in others, but I was confused, stunned,
and my tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of my mouth.  The men who had taken my horses to
Horncastle, and for whom I had sent, as they lived close at hand, now arrived, but the evidence
which they could give was anything but conclusive in my favour; they had seen me in company
with an individual at Horncastle, to whom, by my orders, they had delivered certain horses,
but they had seen no part of the money transaction; the fellow, whether from design or not,
having taken me aside into a retired place, where he had paid me the three spurious notes,
and induced me to change the fourth, which throughout the affair was what bore most materially
against me.  How matters might have terminated I do not know, I might have gone to prison,
and I might have been--just then, when I most needed a friend, and least expected to find one,
for though amongst those present there were several who were my neighbours, and who had professed
friendship for me, none of them when they saw that I needed support and encouragement, came
forward to yield me any, but, on the contrary, appeared by their looks to enjoy my terror and
confusion--just then a friend entered the room in the person of the surgeon of the neighbourhood,
the father of him who has attended you; he was not on very intimate terms with me, but he had
occasionally spoken to me, and had attended my father in his dying illness, and chancing to
hear that I was in trouble, he now hastened to assist me.  After a short preamble, in which
he apologized to the bench for interfering, he begged to be informed of the state of the case,
whereupon the matter was laid before him in all its details.  He was not slow in taking a fair
view of it, and spoke well and eloquently in my behalf--insisting on the improbability that
a person of my habits and position would be wilfully mixed up with a transaction like that
of which it appeared I was suspected--adding, that as he was fully convinced of my innocence,
he was ready to enter into any surety with respect to my appearance at any time to answer anything
which might be laid to my charge.  This last observation had particular effect, and as he was
a person universally respected, both for his skill in his profession and his general demeanour,
people began to think that a person in whom he took an interest could scarcely be concerned
in anything criminal, and though my friend the magistrate--I call him so ironically--made two
or three demurs, it was at last agreed between him and his brethren of the bench, that, for
the present, I should be merely called upon to enter into my own recognizance for the sum of
two hundred pounds, to appear whenever it should be deemed requisite to enter into any further
investigation of the matter.

"So I was permitted to depart from the tribunal of petty justice without handcuffs, and uncollared
by a constable; but people looked coldly and suspiciously upon me.  The first thing I did was
to hasten to the house of my beloved, in order to inform her of every circumstance attending
the transaction.  I found her, but how?  A malicious female individual had hurried to her with
a distorted tale, to the effect that I had been taken up as an utterer of forged notes; that
an immense number had been found in my possession; that I was already committed, and that probably
I should be executed.  My affianced one tenderly loved me, and her constitution was delicate;
fit succeeded fit; she broke a blood-vessel, and I found her deluged in blood; the surgeon
had been sent for; he came and afforded her every possible relief.  I was distracted; he bade
me have hope, but I observed he looked very grave.

"By the skill of the surgeon, the poor girl was saved in the first instance from the arms of
death, and for a few weeks she appeared to be rapidly recovering; by degrees, however, she
became melancholy; a worm preyed upon her spirit; a slow fever took possession of her frame.
I subsequently learned that the same malicious female who had first carried to her an exaggerated
account of the affair, and who was a distant relative of her own, frequently visited her, and
did all in her power to excite her fears with respect to its eventual termination.  Time passed
on in a very wretched manner.  Our friend the surgeon showing to us both every mark of kindness
and attention.

"It was owing to this excellent man that my innocence was eventually established.  Having been
called to a town on the borders of Yorkshire to a medical consultation, he chanced to be taking
a glass of wine with the landlord of the inn at which he stopped, when the waiter brought in
a note to be changed, saying 'That the Quaker gentleman, who had been for some days in the
house, and was about to depart, had sent it to be changed, in order that he might pay his bill.'
The landlord took the note, and looked at it.  'A fifty-pound bill,' said he; 'I don't like
changing bills of that amount, lest they should prove bad ones; however, as it comes from a
Quaker gentleman, I suppose it is all right.'  The mention of a fifty-pound note aroused the
attention of my friend, and he requested to be permitted to look at it; he had scarcely seen
it, when he was convinced that it was one of the same description as those which had brought
me into trouble, as it corresponded with them in two particular features, which the agent of
the bank had pointed out to him and others as evidence of their spuriousness.  My friend, without
a moment's hesitation, informed the landlord that the note was a bad one, expressing at the
same time a great wish to see the Quaker gentleman who wanted to have it changed.  'That you
can easily do,' said the landlord, and forthwith conducted him into the common room, where
he saw a respectable- looking man, dressed like a Quaker, and seemingly about sixty years of age.

"My friend, after a short apology, showed him the note which he held in his hand, stating that
he had no doubt it was a spurious one, and begged to be informed where he had taken it, adding,
that a particular friend of his was at present in trouble, owing to his having taken similar
notes from a stranger at Horncastle; but that he hoped that he, the Quaker, could give information,
by means of which the guilty party, or parties, could be arrested.  At the mention of Horncastle,
it appeared to my friend that the Quaker gave a slight start.  At the conclusion of this speech,
however, he answered, with great tranquillity, that he had received it in the way of business
at ---, naming one of the principal towns in Yorkshire, from a very respectable person, whose
name he was perfectly willing to communicate, and likewise his own, which he said was James,
and that he was a merchant residing at Liverpool; that he would write to his friend at ---,
requesting him to make inquiries on the subject; that just at that moment he was in a hurry
to depart, having some particular business at a town about ten miles off, to go to which he
had bespoken a post-chaise of the landlord; that with respect to the note, it was doubtless
a very disagreeable thing to have a suspicious one in his possession, but that it would make
little difference to him, as he had plenty of other money, and thereupon he pulled out a purse,
containing various other notes, and some gold, observing, 'that his only motive for wishing
to change the other note was a desire to be well provided with change;' and finally, that if
they had any suspicion with respect to him, he was perfectly willing to leave the note in their
possession till he should return, which he intended to do in about a fortnight.  There was
so much plausibility in the speech of the Quaker, and his appearance and behaviour were so
perfectly respectable, that my friend felt almost ashamed of the suspicion which at first he
had entertained of him, though, at the same time, he felt an unaccountable unwillingness to
let the man depart without some further interrogation. The landlord, however, who did not wish
to disoblige one who had been, and might probably be again, a profitable customer, declared
that he was perfectly satisfied; and that he had no wish to detain the note, which he made
no doubt the gentleman had received in the way of business, and that as the matter concerned
him alone, he would leave it to him to make the necessary inquiries.  'Just as you please,
friend,' said the Quaker, pocketing the suspicious note, 'I will now pay my bill.'  Thereupon
he discharged the bill with a five-pound note, which he begged the landlord to inspect carefully,
and with two pieces of gold.

"The landlord had just taken the money, receipted the bill, and was bowing to his customer,
when the door opened, and a lad, dressed in a kind of grey livery, appeared, and informed the
Quaker that the chaise was ready.  'Is that boy your servant?' said the surgeon.  'He is, friend,'
said the Quaker.  'Hast thou any reason for asking me that question?'  'And has he been long
in your service?'  'Several years,' replied the Quaker, 'I took him into my house out of compassion,
he being an orphan, but as the chaise is waiting, I will bid thee farewell.'  'I am afraid
I must stop your journey for the present,' said the surgeon; 'that boy has exactly the same
blemish in the eye which a boy had who was in company with the man at Horncastle, from whom
my friend received the forged notes, and who there passed for his son.'  'I know nothing about
that,' said the Quaker, 'but I am determined to be detained here no longer, after the satisfactory
account which I have given as to the note's coming into my possession.'  He then attempted
to leave the room, but my friend detained him, a struggle ensued, during which a wig which
the Quaker wore fell off, whereupon he instantly appeared to lose some twenty years of his
age.  'Knock the fellow down, father,' said the boy, 'I'll help you.'

"And, forsooth, the pretended Quaker took the boy's advice, and knocked my friend down in a
twinkling.  The landlord, however, and waiter, seeing how matters stood, instantly laid hold
of him; but there can be no doubt that he would have escaped from the whole three, had not
certain guests who were in the house, hearing the noise, rushed in, and helped to secure him.
The boy was true to his word, assisting him to the best of his ability, flinging himself between
the legs of his father's assailants, causing several of them to stumble and fall.  At length,
the fellow was secured, and led before a magistrate; the boy, to whom he was heard to say something
which nobody understood, and to whom, after the man's capture, no one paid much attention,
was no more seen.

"The rest, as far as this man was concerned, may be told in a few words; nothing to criminate
him was found on his person, but on his baggage being examined, a quantity of spurious notes
were discovered.  Much of his hardihood now forsook him, and in the hope of saving his life
he made some very important disclosures; amongst other things, he confessed that it was he
who had given me the notes in exchange for the horses, and also the note to be changed.  He
was subsequently tried on two indictments, in the second of which I appeared against him. 
He was condemned to die; but, in consideration of the disclosures he had made, his sentence
was commuted to perpetual transportation.

"My innocence was thus perfectly established before the eyes of the world, and all my friends
hastened to congratulate me.  There was one who congratulated me more than all the rest--it
was my beloved one, but--but--she was dying--"

Here the old man drew his hand before his eyes, and remained for some time without speaking;
at length he removed his hand, and commenced again with a broken voice: "You will pardon me
if I hurry over this part of my story, I am unable to dwell upon it.  How dwell upon a period
when I saw my only earthly treasure pine away gradually day by day, and knew that nothing could
save her!  She saw my agony, and did all she could to console me, saying that she was herself
quite resigned.  A little time before her death she expressed a wish that we should be united.
I was too happy to comply with her request.  We were united, I brought her to this house, where,
in less than a week, she expired in my arms."

CHAPTER XXXIV

The Old Man's Story continued--Misery in the Head--The Strange Marks--Tea- dealer from London--Difficulties
of the Chinese Language.

After another pause the old man once more resumed his narration:--"If ever there was a man
perfectly miserable it was myself, after the loss of that cherished woman.  I sat solitary
in the house, in which I had hoped in her company to realize the choicest earthly happiness,
a prey to the bitterest reflections; many people visited, and endeavoured to console me--amongst
them was the clergyman of the parish, who begged me to be resigned, and told me that it was
good to be afflicted.  I bowed my head, but I could not help thinking how easy it must be for
those who feel no affliction, to bid others to be resigned, and to talk of the benefit resulting
from sorrow; perhaps I should have paid more attention to his discourse than I did, provided
he had been a person for whom it was possible to entertain much respect, but his own heart
was known to be set on the things of this world.

"Within a little time he had an opportunity, in his own case, of practising resignation, and
of realizing the benefit of being afflicted. A merchant, to whom he had entrusted all his fortune,
in the hope of a large interest, became suddenly a bankrupt, with scarcely any assets.  I will
not say that it was owing to this misfortune that the divine died in less than a month after
its occurrence, but such was the fact.  Amongst those who most frequently visited me was my
friend the surgeon; he did not confine himself to the common topics of consolation, but endeavoured
to impress upon me the necessity of rousing myself, advising me to occupy my mind with some
pursuit, particularly recommending agriculture; but agriculture possessed no interest for me,
nor, indeed, any pursuit within my reach; my hopes of happiness had been blighted, and what
cared I for anything? so at last he thought it best to leave me to myself, hoping that time
would bring with it consolation; and I remained solitary in my house, waited upon by a male
and a female servant.  Oh, what dreary moments I passed!  My only amusement--and it was a sad
one--was to look at the things which once belonged to my beloved, and which were now in my
possession.  Oh, how fondly would I dwell upon them!  There were some books; I cared not for
books, but these had belonged to my beloved.  Oh, how fondly did I dwell on them!  Then there
was her hat and bonnet--oh, me, how fondly did I gaze upon them! and after looking at her things
for hours, I would sit and ruminate on the happiness I had lost.  How I execrated the moment
I had gone to the fair to sell horses!  'Would that I had never been to Horncastle to sell
horses!' I would say; 'I might at this moment have been enjoying the company of my beloved,
leading a happy, quiet, easy life, but for that fatal expedition;' that thought worked on my
brain, till my brain seemed to turn round.

"One day I sat at the breakfast-table gazing vacantly around me, my mind was in a state of
inexpressible misery; there was a whirl in my brain, probably like that which people feel who
are rapidly going mad; this increased to such a degree that I felt giddiness coming upon me.
To abate this feeling I no longer permitted my eyes to wander about, but fixed them upon an
object on the table, and continued gazing at it for several minutes without knowing what it
was; at length, the misery in my head was somewhat stilled, my lips moved, and I heard myself
saying, 'What odd marks!'  I had fastened my eyes on the side of a teapot, and by keeping them
fixed upon it, had become aware of a fact that had escaped my notice before--namely, that there
were marks upon it.  I kept my eyes fixed upon them, and repeated at intervals, 'What strange
marks!'--for I thought that looking upon the marks tended to abate the whirl in my head: I
kept tracing the marks one after the other, and I observed that though they all bore a general
resemblance to each other, they were all to a certain extent different.  The smallest portion
possible of curious interest had been awakened within me, and, at last, I asked myself, within
my own mind, 'What motive could induce people to put such odd marks on their crockery? they
were not pictures, they were not letters; what motive could people have for putting them there?'
At last I removed my eyes from the teapot, and thought for a few moments about the marks; presently,
however, I felt the whirl returning; the marks became almost effaced from my mind, and I was
beginning to revert to my miserable ruminations, when suddenly methought I heard a voice say,
'The marks! the marks! cling to the marks? or--'  So I fixed my eyes again upon the marks,
inspecting them more attentively, if possible, than I had done before, and, at last, I came
to the conclusion that they were not capricious or fanciful marks, but were arranged systematically;
when I had gazed at them for a considerable time, I turned the teapot round, and on the other
side I observed marks of a similar kind, which I soon discovered were identical with the ones
I had been observing.  All the marks were something alike, but all somewhat different, and
on comparing them with each other, I was struck with the frequent occurrence of a mark crossing
an upright line, or projecting from it, now on the right, now on the left side; and I said
to myself, 'Why does this mark sometimes cross the upright line, and sometimes project?' and
the more I thought on the matter, the less did I feel of the misery in my head.

"The things were at length removed, and I sat, as I had for some time past been wont to sit
after my meals, silent and motionless; but in the present instance my mind was not entirely
abandoned to the one mournful idea which had so long distressed it.  It was, to a certain extent,
occupied with the marks on the teapot; it is true that the mournful idea strove hard with the
marks on the teapot for the mastery in my mind, and at last the painful idea drove the marks
of the teapot out; they, however, would occasionally return and flit across my mind for a moment
or two, and their coming was like a momentary relief from intense pain.  I thought once or
twice that I would have the teapot placed before me, that I might examine the marks at leisure,
but I considered that it would be as well to defer the re-examination of the marks till the
next morning; at that time I did not take tea of an evening.  By deferring the examination
thus, I had something to look forward to on the next morning. The day was a melancholy one,
but it certainly was more tolerable to me than any of the others had been since the death of
my beloved.  As I lay awake that night I occasionally thought of the marks, and in my sleep
methought I saw them upon the teapot vividly before me.  On the morrow, I examined the marks
again; how singular they looked!  Surely they must mean something, and if so, what could they
mean? and at last I thought within myself whether it would be possible for me to make out what
they meant: that day I felt more relief than on the preceding one, and towards night I walked
a little about.

"In about a week's time I received a visit from my friend the surgeon; after a little discourse,
he told me that he perceived I was better than when he had last seen me, and asked me what
I had been about; I told him that I had been principally occupied in considering certain marks
which I had found on a teapot, and wondering what they could mean; he smiled at first, but
instantly assuming a serious look, he asked to see the teapot. I produced it, and after having
surveyed the marks with attention, he observed that they were highly curious, and also wondered
what they meant.  'I strongly advise you,' said he, 'to attempt to make them out, and also
to take moderate exercise, and to see after your concerns.'  I followed his advice; every morning
I studied the marks on the teapot, and in the course of the day took moderate exercise, and
attended to little domestic matters, as became the master of a house.

"I subsequently learned that the surgeon, in advising me to study the marks, and endeavour
to make out their meaning, merely hoped that by means of them my mind might by degrees be diverted
from the mournful idea on which I had so long brooded.  He was a man well skilled in his profession,
but had read and thought very little on matters unconnected with it.  He had no idea that the
marks had any particular signification, or were anything else but common and fortuitous ones.
That I became at all acquainted with their nature was owing to a ludicrous circumstance which
I will now relate.

"One day, chancing to be at a neighbouring town, I was struck with the appearance of a shop
recently established.  It had an immense bow-window, and every part of it, to which a brush
could be applied, was painted in a gaudy flaming style.  Large bowls of green and black tea
were placed upon certain chests, which stood at the window.  I stopped to look at them, such
a display, whatever it may be at the present time, being, at the period of which I am speaking,
quite uncommon in a country town.  The tea, whether black or green, was very shining and inviting,
and the bowls, of which there were three, standing on as many chests, were very grand and foreign
looking.  Two of these were white, with figures and trees painted upon them in blue; the other,
which was the middlemost, had neither trees nor figures upon it, but, as I looked through the
window, appeared to have on its sides the very same kind of marks which I had observed on the
teapot at home; there were also marks on the tea-chests, somewhat similar, but much larger,
and, apparently, not executed with so much care.  'Best teas direct from China,' said a voice
close to my side; and looking round I saw a youngish man, with a frizzled head, flat face,
and an immensely wide mouth, standing in his shirt-sleeves by the door. 'Direct from China,'
said he; 'perhaps you will do me the favour to walk in and scent them?'  'I do not want any
tea,' said I; 'I was only standing at the window examining those marks on the bowl and the
chests. I have observed similar ones on a teapot at home.'  'Pray walk in, sir,' said the young
fellow, extending his mouth till it reached nearly from ear to ear; 'pray walk in, and I shall
be happy to give you any information respecting the manners and customs of the Chinese in my
power.'  Thereupon I followed him into his shop, where he began to harangue on the manners,
customs, and peculiarities of the Chinese, especially their manner of preparing tea, not forgetting
to tell me that the only genuine Chinese tea ever imported into England was to be found in
his shop.  'With respect to those marks,' said he, 'on the bowl and chests, they are nothing
more nor less than Chinese writing expressing something, though what I can't exactly tell you.
Allow me to sell you this pound of tea,' he added, showing me a paper parcel.  'On the envelope
there is a printed account of the Chinese system of writing, extracted from authors of the
most established reputation.  These things I print, principally with the hope of, in some degree,
removing the worse than Gothic ignorance prevalent amongst natives of these parts.  I am from
London myself.  With respect to all that relates to the Chinese real imperial tea, I assure
you sir, that--'  Well, to make short of what you doubtless consider a very tiresome story,
I purchased the tea and carried it home.  The tea proved imperially bad, but the paper envelope
really contained some information on the Chinese language and writing, amounting to about as
much as you gained from me the other day.  On learning that the marks on the teapot expressed
words, I felt my interest with respect to them considerably increased, and returned to the
task of inspecting them with greater zeal than before, hoping, by continually looking at them,
to be able eventually to understand their meaning, in which hope you may easily believe I was
disappointed, though my desire to understand what they represented continued on the increase.
In this dilemma I determined to apply again to the shopkeeper from whom I bought the tea. 
I found him in rather low spirits, his shirt-sleeves were soiled, and his hair was out of curl.
On my inquiring how he got on, he informed me that he intended speedily to leave, having received
little or no encouragement, the people, in their Gothic ignorance, preferring to deal with
an old-fashioned shopkeeper over the way, who, so far from possessing any acquaintance with
the polity and institutions of the Chinese, did not, he believed, know that tea came from China.
'You are come for some more, I suppose?' said he.  On receiving an answer in the negative he
looked somewhat blank, but when I added that I came to consult with him as to the means which
I must take in order to acquire the Chinese language he brightened up.  'You must get a grammar,'
said he, rubbing his hands.  'Have you not one?' said I.  'No,' he replied, 'but any bookseller
can procure you one.'  As I was taking my departure, he told me that as he was about to leave
the neighbourhood, the bowl at the window, which bore the inscription, besides some other pieces
of porcelain of a similar description, were at my service, provided I chose to purchase them.
I consented, and two or three days afterwards took from off his hands all the china in his
possession which bore the inscriptions, paying what he demanded.  Had I waited till the sale
of his effects, which occurred within a few weeks, I could probably have procured it for a
fifth part of the sum which I paid, the other pieces realizing very little.  I did not, however,
grudge the poor fellow what he got from me, as I considered myself to be somewhat in his debt
for the information he had afforded me.

"As for the rest of my story, it may be briefly told.  I followed the advice of the shopkeeper,
and applied to a bookseller who wrote to his correspondent in London.  After a long interval,
I was informed that if I wished to learn Chinese, I must do so through the medium of French,
there being neither Chinese grammar nor dictionary in our language.  I was at first very much
disheartened.  I determined, however, at last to gratify my desire of learning Chinese, even
at the expense of learning French.  I procured the books, and in order to qualify myself to
turn them to account, took lessons in French from a little Swiss, the usher of a neighbouring
boarding-school.  I was very stupid in acquiring French; perseverance, however, enabled me
to acquire a knowledge sufficient for the object I had in view.  In about two years I began
to study Chinese by myself, through the medium of the French."

"Well," said I, "and how did you get on with the study of the Chinese?"

And then the old man proceeded to inform me how he got on with the study of Chinese, enumerated
all the difficulties he had had to encounter; dilating upon his frequent despondency of mind,
and occasionally his utter despair of ever mastering Chinese.  He told me that more than once
he had determined upon giving up the study, but when the misery in his head forthwith returned,
to escape from which he had as often resumed it. It appeared, however, that ten years elapsed
before he was able to use ten of the two hundred and fourteen keys, which serve to undo the
locks of Chinese writing.

"And are you able at present to use the entire number?" I demanded.

"Yes," said the old man; "I can at present use the whole number.  I know the key for every
particular lock, though I frequently find the wards unwilling to give way."

"Has nothing particular occurred to you," said I, "during the time that you have been prosecuting
your studies?"

"During the whole time in which I have been engaged in these studies," said the old man, "only
one circumstance has occurred which requires any particular mention--the death of my old friend
the surgeon--who was carried off suddenly by a fit of apoplexy.  His death was a great shock
to me, and for a time interrupted my studies.  His son, however, who succeeded him, was very
kind to me, and, in some degree, supplied his father's place; and I gradually returned to my
Chinese locks and keys."

"And in applying keys to the Chinese locks you employ your time?"

"Yes," said the old man, "in making out the inscriptions on the various pieces of porcelain,
which I have at different times procured, I pass my time.  The first inscription which I translated
was that on the teapot of my beloved."

"And how many other pieces of porcelain may you have at present in your possession?"

"About fifteen hundred."

"And how did you obtain them?" I demanded.

"Without much labour," said the old man, "in the neighbouring towns and villages--chiefly at
auctions--of which, about twenty years ago, there were many in these parts."

"And may I ask your reasons for confining your studies entirely to the crockery literature
of China, when you have all the rest at your disposal?"

"The inscriptions enable me to pass my time," said the old man; "what more would the whole
literature of China do?"

"And from these inscriptions," said I, "what a book it is in your power to make, whenever so
disposed.  'Translations from the crockery literature of China.'  Such a book would be sure
to take; even glorious John himself would not disdain to publish it."  The old man smiled.
"I have no desire for literary distinction," said he; "no ambition.  My original wish was to
pass my life in easy, quiet obscurity, with her whom I loved.  I was disappointed in my wish;
she was removed, who constituted my only felicity in this life; desolation came to my heart,
and misery to my head.  To escape from the latter I had recourse to Chinese.  By degrees the
misery left my head, but the desolation of the heart yet remains."

"Be of good cheer," said I; "through the instrumentality of this affliction you have learnt
Chinese, and, in so doing, learnt to practise the duties of hospitality.  Who but a man who
could read Runes on a teapot, would have received an unfortunate wayfarer as you have received me?"

"Well," said the old man, "let us hope that all is for the best.  I am by nature indolent,
and, but for this affliction, should, perhaps, have hardly taken the trouble to do my duty
to my fellow-creatures.  I am very, very indolent," said he, slightly glancing towards the
clock; "therefore let us hope that all is for the best; but, oh! these trials, they are very
hard to bear."

CHAPTER XXXV

The Leave-taking--Spirit of the Hearth--What's o'Clock?

The next morning, having breakfasted with my old friend, I went into the stable to make the
necessary preparations for my departure; there, with the assistance of a stable lad, I cleaned
and caparisoned my horse, and then, returning into the house, I made the old female attendant
such a present as I deemed would be some compensation for the trouble I had caused.  Hearing
that the old gentleman was in his study, I repaired to him.  "I am come to take leave of you,"
said I, "and to thank you for all the hospitality which I have received at your hands."  The
eyes of the old man were fixed steadfastly on the inscription which I had found him studying
on a former occasion.  "At length," he murmured to himself, "I have it--I think I have it;"
and then, looking at me, he said, "So you are about to depart?"

"Yes," said I, "my horse will be at the front door in a few minutes; I am glad, however, before
I go, to find that you have mastered the inscription."

"Yes," said the old man, "I believe I have mastered it; it seems to consist of some verses
relating to the worship of the Spirit of the Hearth."

"What is the Spirit of the Hearth?" said I.

"One of the many demons which the Chinese worship," said the old man; "they do not worship
one God, but many."  And then the old man told me a great many highly-interesting particulars
respecting the demon worship of the Chinese.

After the lapse of at least half an hour I said, "I must not linger here any longer, however
willing.  Horncastle is distant, and I wish to be there to-night.  Pray can you inform me what's
o'clock?"

The old man, rising, looked towards the clock which hung on the side of the room at his left
hand, on the farther side of the table at which he was seated.

"I am rather short-sighted," said I, "and cannot distinguish the number, at that distance."

"It is ten o'clock," said the old man; "I believe somewhat past."

"A quarter, perhaps?"

"Yes," said the old man "a quarter or--"

"Or?"

"Seven minutes, or ten minutes past ten."

"I do not understand you."

"Why, to tell you the truth," said the old man, with a smile, "there is one thing to the knowledge
of which I could never exactly attain."

"Do you mean to say," said I, "that you do not know what's o'clock?"

"I can give a guess," said the old man, "to within a few minutes."

"But you cannot tell the exact moment?"

"No," said the old man.

"In the name of wonder," said I, "with that thing there on the wall continually ticking in
your ear, how comes it that you do not know what's o'clock?"

"Why," said the old man, "I have contented myself with giving a tolerably good guess; to do
more would have been too great trouble."

"But you have learnt Chinese," said I.

"Yes," said the old man, "I have learnt Chinese."

"Well," said I, "I really would counsel you to learn to know what's o'clock as soon as possible.
Consider what a sad thing it would be to go out of the world not knowing what's o'clock.  A
millionth part of the trouble required to learn Chinese would, if employed, infallibly teach
you to know what's o'clock."

"I had a motive for learning Chinese," said the old man, "the hope of appeasing the misery
in my head.  With respect to not knowing what's o'clock, I cannot see anything particularly
sad in the matter.  A man may get through the world very creditably without knowing what's
o'clock. Yet, upon the whole, it is no bad thing to know what's o'clock--you, of course, do?
It would be too good a joke if two people were to be together, one knowing Armenian and the
other Chinese, and neither knowing what's o'clock.  I'll now see you off."

CHAPTER XXXVI

Arrival at Horncastle--The Inn and Ostlers--The Garret--Figure of a Man with a Candle.

Leaving the house of the old man who knew Chinese, but could not tell what was o'clock, I wended
my way to Horncastle, which I reached in the evening of the same day, without having met any
adventure on the way worthy of being marked down in this very remarkable history.

The town was a small one, seemingly ancient, and was crowded with people and horses.  I proceeded,
without delay, to the inn to which my friend the surgeon had directed me.  "It is of no use
coming here," said two or three ostlers, as I entered the yard--"all full--no room whatever;"
whilst one added in an undertone, "That ere a'n't a bad-looking horse." "I want to see the
master of this inn," said I, as I dismounted from the horse.  "See the master," said an ostler--the
same who had paid the negative kind of compliment to the horse--"a likely thing, truly; my
master is drinking wine with some of the grand gentry, and can't be disturbed for the sake
of the like of you."  "I bring a letter to him," said I, pulling out the surgeon's epistle.
"I wish you would deliver it to him," I added, offering a half-crown.  "Oh, it's you, is it?"
said the ostler, taking the letter and the half-crown; "my master will be right glad to see
you; why, you ha'n't been here for many a year; I'll carry the note to him at once."  And with
these words he hurried into the house.  "That's a nice horse, young man," said another ostler,
"what will you take for it?" to which interrogation I made no answer.  "If you wish to sell
him," said the ostler, coming up to me, and winking knowingly, "I think I and my partners might
offer you a summut under seventy pounds;" to which kind and half-insinuated offer I made no
reply, save by winking in the same kind of knowing manner in which I observed him wink.  "Rather
leary!" said a third ostler.  "Well, young man, perhaps you will drink to- night with me and
my partners, when we can talk the matter over."  Before I had time to answer, the landlord,
a well-dressed, good-looking man, made his appearance with the ostler; he bore the letter in
his hand. Without glancing at me, he betook himself at once to consider the horse, going round
him, and observing every point with the utmost minuteness.  At last, having gone round the
horse three times, he stopped beside me, and keeping his eyes on the horse, bent his head towards
his right shoulder. "That horse is worth some money," said he, turning towards me suddenly,
and slightly touching me on the arm with the letter which he held in his hand; to which observation
I made no reply, save by bending my head towards the right shoulder as I had seen him do. 
"The young man is going to talk to me and my partners about it to-night," said the ostler who
had expressed an opinion that he and his friends might offer me somewhat under seventy pounds
for the animal.  "Pooh!" said the landlord, "the young man knows what he is about; in the meantime
lead the horse to the reserved stall, and see well after him.  My friend," said he, taking
me aside after the ostler had led the animal away, "recommends you to me in the strongest manner,
on which account alone I take you and your horse in.  I need not advise you not to be taken
in, as I should say, by your look, that you are tolerably awake; but there are queer hands
at Horncastle at this time, and those fellows of mine, you understand me--; but I have a great
deal to do at present, so you must excuse me."  And thereupon went into the house.

That same evening I was engaged at least two hours in the stable, in rubbing the horse down,
and preparing him for the exhibition which I intended he should make in the fair on the following
day.  The ostler, to whom I had given the half-crown, occasionally assisted me, though he was
too much occupied by the horses of other guests to devote any length of time to the service
of mine; he more than once repeated to me his firm conviction that himself and partners could
afford to offer me summut for the horse; and at a later hour when, in compliance with his invitation,
I took a glass of summut with himself and partners, in a little room surrounded with corn-chests,
on which we sat, both himself and partners endeavoured to impress upon me, chiefly by means
of nods and winks, their conviction that they could afford to give me summut for the horse,
provided I were disposed to sell him; in return for which intimation, with as many nods and
winks as they had all collectively used, I endeavoured to impress upon them my conviction that
I could get summut handsomer in the fair than they might be disposed to offer me, seeing as
how--which how I followed by a wink and a nod, which they seemed perfectly to understand, one
or two of them declaring that if the case was so, it made a great deal of difference, and that
they did not wish to be any hindrance to me, more particularly as it was quite clear I had
been an ostler like themselves.

It was late at night when I began to think of retiring to rest.  On inquiring if there was
any place in which I could sleep, I was informed that there was a bed at my service, provided
I chose to sleep in a two- bedded room, one of the beds of which was engaged by another gentleman.
I expressed my satisfaction at this arrangement, and was conducted by a maid-servant up many
pairs of stairs to a garret, in which were two small beds, in one of which she gave me to understand
another gentleman slept; he had, however, not yet retired to rest; I asked who he was, but
the maid-servant could give me no information about him, save that he was a highly respectable
gentleman, and a friend of her master's.  Presently, bidding me good night, she left me with
a candle; and I, having undressed myself and extinguished the light, went to bed.  Notwithstanding
the noises which sounded from every part of the house, I was not slow in falling asleep, being
thoroughly tired.  I know not how long I might have been in bed, perhaps two hours, when I
was partially awakened by a light shining upon my face, whereupon, unclosing my eyes, I perceived
the figure of a man, with a candle in one hand, staring at my face, whilst with the other hand,
he held back the curtain of the bed.  As I have said before, I was only partially awakened,
my power of conception was consequently very confused; it appeared to me, however, that the
man was dressed in a green coat; that he had curly brown or black hair, and that there was
something peculiar in his look.  Just as I was beginning to recollect myself, the curtain dropped,
and I heard, or thought I heard, a voice say, "Don't know the cove."  Then there was a rustling
like a person undressing, whereupon being satisfied that it was my fellow-lodger, I dropped
asleep, but was awakened again by a kind of heavy plunge upon the other bed, which caused it
to rock and creak, when I observed that the light had been extinguished, probably blown out,
if I might judge from a rather disagreeable smell of burnt wick which remained in the room,
and which kept me awake till I heard my companion breathing hard, when, turning on the other
side, I was again once more speedily in the arms of slumber.

CHAPTER XXXVII

Horncastle Fair.

It had been my intention to be up and doing early on the following morning, but my slumbers
proved so profound, that I did not wake until about eight; on arising, I again found myself
the sole occupant of the apartment, my more alert companion having probably risen at a much
earlier hour.  Having dressed myself, I descended, and going to the stable, found my horse
under the hands of my friend the ostler, who was carefully rubbing him down.  "There a'n't
a better horse in the fair," said he to me, "and as you are one of us, and appear to be all
right, I'll give you a piece of advice--don't take less than a hundred and fifty for him; if
you mind your hits, you may get it, for I have known two hundred given in this fair for one
no better, if so good."  "Well," said I, "thank you for your advice, which I will take, and,
if successful, will give you 'summut' handsome."  "Thank you," said the ostler; "and now let
me ask whether you are up to all the ways of this here place?"  "I have never been here before,"
said I, "but I have a pair of tolerably sharp eyes in my head."  "That I see you have," said
the ostler, "but many a body, with as sharp a pair of eyes as yourn, has lost his horse in
this fair, for want of having been here before, therefore," said he, "I'll give you a caution
or two."  Thereupon the ostler proceeded to give me at least half a dozen cautions, only two
of which I shall relate to the reader:--the first, not to stop to listen to what any chance
customer might have to say; and the last--the one on which he appeared to lay most stress--by
no manner of means to permit a Yorkshireman to get up into the saddle, "for," said he, "if
you do, it is three to one that he rides off with the horse; he can't help it; trust a cat
amongst cream, but never trust a Yorkshireman on the saddle of a good horse; by-the-by," he
continued, "that saddle of yours is not a particularly good one, no more is the bridle.  I
tell you what, as you seem a decent kind of a young chap, I'll lend you a saddle and bridle
of my master's, almost bran new; he won't object, I know, as you are a friend of his, only
you must not forget your promise to come down with summut handsome after you have sold the animal."

After a slight breakfast I mounted the horse, which, decked out in his borrowed finery, really
looked better by a large sum of money than on any former occasion.  Making my way out of the
yard of the inn, I was instantly in the principal street of the town, up and down which an
immense number of horses were being exhibited, some led, and others with riders.  "A wonderful
small quantity of good horses in the fair this time!" I heard a stout jockey-looking individual
say, who was staring up the street with his side towards me.  "Halloo, young fellow!" said
he, a few moments after I had passed, "whose horse is that?  Stop!  I want to look at him!"
Though confident that he was addressing himself to me, I took no notice, remembering the advice
of the ostler, and proceeded up the street.  My horse possessed a good walking step; but walking,
as the reader knows, was not his best pace, which was the long trot, at which I could not well
exercise him in the street, on account of the crowd of men and animals; however, as he walked
along, I could easily perceive that he attracted no slight attention amongst those who, by
their jockey dress and general appearance, I imagined to be connoisseurs; I heard various calls
to stop, to none of which I paid the slightest attention.  In a few minutes I found myself
out of the town, when, turning round for the purpose of returning, I found I had been followed
by several of the connoisseur-looking individuals, whom I had observed in the fair.  "Now would
be the time for a display," thought I; and looking around me I observed two five-barred gates,
one on each side of the road, and fronting each other.  Turning my horse's head to one, I pressed
my heels to his sides, loosened the reins, and gave an encouraging cry, whereupon the animal
cleared the gate in a twinkling.  Before he had advanced ten yards in the field to which the
gate opened, I had turned him round, and again giving him cry and rein, I caused him to leap
back again into the road, and still allowing him head, I made him leap the other gate; and
forthwith turning him round, I caused him to leap once more into the road, where he stood proudly
tossing his head, as much as to say, "What more?"  "A fine horse! a capital horse!" said several
of the connoisseurs.  "What do you ask for him?"  "Too much for any of you to pay," said I.
"A horse like this is intended for other kind of customers than any of you."  "How do you know
that?" said one; the very same person whom I had heard complaining in the street of the paucity
of good horses in the fair.  "Come, let us know what you ask for him?"  "A hundred and fifty
pounds!" said I; "neither more nor less."  "Do you call that a great price?" said the man.
"Why, I thought you would have asked double that amount!  You do yourself injustice, young
man."  "Perhaps I do," said I, "but that's my affair; I do not choose to take more."  "I wish
you would let me get into the saddle," said the man; "the horse knows you, and therefore shows
to more advantage; but I should like to see how he would move under me, who am a stranger.
Will you let me get into the saddle, young man?"  "No," said I; "I will not let you get into
the saddle."  "Why not?" said the man.  "Lest you should be a Yorkshireman," said I; "and should
run away with the horse."  "Yorkshire?" said the man; "I am from Suffolk; silly Suffolk--so
you need not be afraid of my running away with the horse."  "Oh! if that's the case," said
I, "I should be afraid that the horse would run away with you; so I will by no means let you
mount."  "Will you let me look in his mouth?" said the man. "If you please," said I; "but I
tell you, he's apt to bite."  "He can scarcely be a worse bite than his master," said the man,
looking into the horse's mouth; "he's four off.  I say, young man, will you warrant this horse?"
"No," said I; "I never warrant horses; the horses that I ride can always warrant themselves."
"I wish you would let me speak a word to you," said he.  "Just come aside.  It's a nice horse,"
said he, in a half whisper, after I had ridden a few paces aside with him.  "It's a nice horse,"
said he, placing his hand upon the pommel of the saddle, and looking up in my face, "and I
think I can find you a customer.  If you would take a hundred, I think my lord would purchase
it, for he has sent me about the fair to look him up a horse, by which he could hope to make
an honest penny."  "Well," said I, "and could he not make an honest penny, and yet give me
the price I ask?"  "Why," said the go-between, "a hundred and fifty pounds is as much as the
animal is worth, or nearly so; and my lord, do you see--"  "I see no reason at all," said I,
"why I should sell the animal for less than he is worth, in order that his lordship may be
benefited by him; so that if his lordship wants to make an honest penny, he must find some
person who would consider the disadvantage of selling him a horse for less than it is worth,
as counterbalanced by the honour of dealing with a lord, which I should never do; but I can't
be wasting my time here.  I am going back to the --- , where, if you, or any person, are desirous
of purchasing the horse, you must come within the next half hour, or I shall probably not feel
disposed to sell him at all."  "Another word, young man," said the jockey; but without staying
to hear what he had to say, I put the horse to his best trot, and re-entering the town, and
threading my way as well as I could through the press, I returned to the yard of the inn, where,
dismounting, I stood still, holding the horse by the bridle.

I had been standing in this manner about five minutes, when I saw the jockey enter the yard,
accompanied by another individual.  They advanced directly towards me.  "Here is my lord come
to look at the horse, young man," said the jockey.  My lord, as the jockey called him, was
a tall figure, of about five-and-thirty.  He had on his head a hat somewhat rusty, and on his
back a surtout of blue rather the worse for wear.  His forehead, if not high, was exceedingly
narrow; his eyes were brown, with a rat-like glare in them; the nose was rather long, and the
mouth very wide; the cheek-bones high, and the cheeks, as to hue and consistency, exhibiting
very much the appearance of a withered red apple; there was a gaunt expression of hunger in
the whole countenance.  He had scarcely glanced at the horse, when drawing in his cheeks, he
thrust out his lips very much after the manner of a baboon, when he sees a piece of sugar held
out towards him.  "Is this horse yours?" said he, suddenly turning towards me, with a kind
of smirk.  "It's my horse," said I; "are you the person who wishes to make an honest penny
by it?"  "How!" said he, drawing up his head with a very consequential look, and speaking with
a very haughty tone, "what do you mean?"  We looked at each other full in the face; after a
few moments, the muscles of the mouth of him of the hungry look began to move violently, the
face was puckered into innumerable wrinkles, and the eyes became half closed.  "Well," said
I, "have you ever seen me before?  I suppose you are asking yourself that question."  "Excuse
me, sir," said he, dropping his lofty look, and speaking in a very subdued and civil tone,
"I have never had the honour of seeing you before, that is"--said he, slightly glancing at
me again, and again moving the muscles of his mouth, "no, I have never seen you before," he
added, making me a bow.  "I have never had that pleasure; my business with you, at present,
is to inquire the lowest price you are willing to take for this horse.  My agent here informs
me that you ask one hundred and fifty pounds, which I cannot think of giving--the horse is
a showy horse, but look, my dear sir, he has a defect here, and there in his near fore leg
I observe something which looks very like a splint--yes, upon my credit," said he, touching
the animal, "he has a splint, or something which will end in one.  A hundred and fifty pounds,
sir! what could have induced you ever to ask anything like that for this animal?  I protest
that, in my time, I have frequently bought a better for-- Who are you, sir?  I am in treaty
for this horse," said he to a man who had come up whilst he was talking, and was now looking
into the horse's mouth.  "Who am I?" said the man, still looking into the horse's mouth; "who
am I? his lordship asks me.  Ah, I see, close on five," said he, releasing the horse's jaws,
and looking at me.  This new comer was a thin, wiry-made individual, with wiry curling brown
hair; his face was dark, and wore an arch and somewhat roguish expression; upon one of his
eyes was a kind of speck or beam; he might be about forty, wore a green jockey coat, and held
in his hand a black riding whip, with a knob of silver wire.  As I gazed upon his countenance,
it brought powerfully to my mind the face which, by the light of the candle, I had seen staring
over me on the preceding night, when lying in bed and half asleep.  Close beside him, and seemingly
in his company, stood an exceedingly tall figure, that of a youth, seemingly about one-and-twenty,
dressed in a handsome riding dress, and wearing on his head a singular hat, green in colour,
and with a very high peak.  "What do you ask for this horse?" said he of the green coat, winking
at me with the eye which had a beam in it, whilst the other shone and sparkled like Mrs. Colonel
W-'s Golconda diamond.  "Who are you, sir, I demand once more?" said he of the hungry look.
"Who am I? why, who should I be but Jack Dale, who buys horses for himself and other folk;
I want one at present for this short young gentleman," said he, motioning with his finger to
the gigantic youth. "Well, sir," said the other, "and what business have you to interfere between
me and any purchase I may be disposed to make?"  "Well, then," said the other, "be quick and
purchase the horse, or, perhaps, I may." "Do you think I am to be dictated to by a fellow of
your description?" said his lordship, "begone, or--"  "What do you ask for this horse?" said
the other to me, very coolly.  "A hundred and fifty," said I.  "I shouldn't mind giving it
to you," said he.  "You will do no such thing," said his lordship, speaking so fast that he
almost stuttered.  "Sir," said he to me, "I must give you what you ask; Symmonds, take possession
of the animal for me," said he to the other jockey who attended him.  "You will please to do
no such thing without my consent," said I, "I have not sold him."  "I have this moment told
you that I will give you the price you demand," said his lordship; "is not that sufficient?"
"No," said I, "there is a proper manner of doing everything--had you come forward in a manly
and gentlemanly manner to purchase the horse, I should have been happy to sell him to you,
but after all the fault you have found with him, I would not sell him to you at any price,
so send your friend to find up another."  "You behave in this manner, I suppose," said his
lordship, "because this fellow has expressed a willingness to come to your terms.  I would
advise you to be cautious how you trust the animal in his hands; I think I have seen him before,
and could tell you--"  "What can you tell of me?" said the other, going up to him; "except
that I have been a poor dicky-boy, and that now I am a dealer in horses, and that my father
was lagged; that's all you could tell of me, and that I don't mind telling myself: but there
are two things they can't say of me, they can't say that I am either a coward or a screw either,
except so far as one who gets his bread by horses may be expected to be; and they can't say
of me that I ever ate up an ice which a young woman was waiting for, or that I ever backed
out of a fight.  Horse!" said he, motioning with his finger tauntingly to the other; "what
do you want with a horse, except to take the bread out of the mouth of a poor man--to-morrow
is not the battle of Waterloo, so that you don't want to back out of danger, by pretending
to have hurt yourself by falling from the creature's back, my lord of the white feather--come,
none of your fierce looks--I am not afraid of you." In fact, the other had assumed an expression
of the deadliest malice, his teeth were clenched, his lips quivered, and were quite pale; the
rat-like eyes sparkled, and he made a half spring, a la rat, towards his adversary, who only
laughed.  Restraining himself, however, he suddenly turned to his understrapper, saying, "Symmonds,
will you see me thus insulted? go and trounce this scoundrel; you can, I know."  "Symmonds
trounce me!" said the other, going up to the person addressed, and drawing his hand contemptuously
over his face; "why, I beat Symmonds in this very yard in one round three years ago; didn't
I, Symmonds?" said he to the understrapper, who held down his head, muttering, in a surly tone,
"I didn't come here to fight; let every one take his own part."  "That's right, Symmonds,"
said the other, "especially every one from whom there is nothing to be got.  I would give you
half-a-crown for all the trouble you have had, provided I were not afraid that my Lord Plume
there would get it from you as soon as you leave the yard together.  Come, take yourselves
both off; there's nothing to be made here."  Indeed, his lordship seemed to be of the same
opinion, for after a further glance at the horse, a contemptuous look at me, and a scowl at
the jockey, he turned on his heel, muttering something which sounded like fellows, and stalked
out of the yard, followed by Symmonds.

"And now, young man," said the jockey, or whatever he was, turning to me with an arch leer,
"I suppose I may consider myself as the purchaser of this here animal, for the use and behoof
of this young gentleman?" making a sign with his head to the tall young man by his side.  "By
no means," said I, "I am utterly unacquainted with either of you, and before parting with the
horse I must be satisfied as to the respectability of the purchaser."  "Oh! as to that matter,"
said he, "I have plenty of vouchers for my respectability about me;" and thrusting his hand
into his bosom below his waistcoat, he drew out a large bundle of notes.  "These are the kind
of things," said he, "which vouch best for a man's respectability." "Not always," said I; "indeed,
sometimes these kind of things need vouchers for themselves."  The man looked at me with a
peculiar look.  "Do you mean to say that these notes are not sufficient notes?" said he, "because
if you do I shall take the liberty of thinking you are not over civil, and when I thinks a
person is not over and above civil I sometimes takes off my coat; and when my coat is off--"
"You sometimes knock people down," I added; "well, whether you knock me down or not, I beg
leave to tell you that I am a stranger in this fair, and that I shall part with the horse to
nobody who has no better guarantee for his respectability than a roll of bank-notes, which
may be good or not for what I know, who am not a judge of such things."  "Oh! if you are a
stranger here," said the man, "as I believe you are, never having seen you here before except
last night, when I think I saw you above stairs by the glimmer of a candle--I say, if you are
a stranger, you are quite right to be cautious; queer things being done in this fair, as nobody
knows better than myself," he added with a leer; "but I suppose if the landlord of the house
vouches for me and my notes, you will have no objection to part with the horse to me?"  "None
whatever," said I, "and in the meantime the horse can return to the stable."

Thereupon I delivered the horse to my friend the ostler.

The landlord of the house on being questioned by me as to the character and condition of my
new acquaintance, informed me that he was a respectable horsedealer, and an intimate friend
of his, whereupon the purchase was soon brought to a satisfactory conclusion.

CHAPTER XXXVIII

High Dutch.

It was evening: and myself and the two acquaintances I had made in the fair--namely, the jockey
and the tall foreigner--sat in a large upstairs room, which looked into a court; we had dined
with several people connected with the fair at a long table d'hote; they had now departed,
and we sat at a small side-table with wine and a candle before us; both my companions had pipes
in their mouths--the jockey a common pipe, and the foreigner, one, the syphon of which, made
of some kind of wood, was at least six feet long, and the bowl of which, made of a white kind
of substance like porcelain, and capable of holding nearly an ounce of tobacco, rested on the
ground.  The jockey frequently emptied and replenished his glass; the foreigner sometimes raised
his to his lips, for no other purpose seemingly than to moisten them, as he never drained his
glass.  As for myself, though I did not smoke, I had a glass before me, from which I sometimes
took a sip.  The room, notwithstanding the window was flung open, was in general so filled
with smoke, chiefly that which was drawn from the huge bowl of the foreigner, that my companions
and I were frequently concealed from each other's eyes.  The conversation, which related entirely
to the events of the fair, was carried on by the jockey and myself, the foreigner, who appeared
to understand the greater part of what we said, occasionally putting in a few observations
in broken English.  At length the jockey, after the other had made some ineffectual attempts
to express something intelligibly which he wished to say, observed, "Isn't it a pity that so
fine a fellow as meinheer, and so clever a fellow too, as I believe him to be, is not a better
master of our language?"

"Is the gentleman a German?" said I; "if so, I can interpret for him anything he wishes to say."

"The deuce you can," said the jockey, taking his pipe out of his mouth, and staring at me through
the smoke.

"Ha! you speak German," vociferated the foreigner in that language.  "By Isten, I am glad of
it!  I wanted to say--"  And here he said in German what he wished to say, and which was of
no great importance, and which I translated into English.

"Well, if you don't put me out," said the jockey; "what language is that--Dutch?"

"High Dutch," said I.

"High Dutch, and you speak High Dutch,--why, I had booked you for as great an ignoramus as
myself, who can't write--no, nor distinguish in a book a great A from a bull's foot."

"A person may be a very clever man," said I--"no, not a clever man, for clever signifies clerkly,
and a clever man one who is able to read and write, and entitled to the benefit of his clergy
or clerkship; but a person may be a very acute person without being able to read or write.
I never saw a more acute countenance than your own."

"No soft soap," said the jockey, "for I never uses any.  However, thank you for your information;
I have hitherto thought myself a'nition clever fellow, but from henceforth shall consider myself
just the contrary, and only--what's the word?--confounded 'cute."

"Just so," said I.

"Well," said the jockey, "as you say you can speak High Dutch, I should like to hear you and
master six foot six fire away at each other."

"I cannot speak German," said I, "but I can understand tolerably well what others say in it."

"Come no backing out," said the jockey, "let's hear you fire away for the glory of Old England."

"Then you are a German?" said I, in German to the foreigner.

"That will do," said the jockey, "keep it up."

"A German!" said the tall foreigner.  "No, I thank God that I do not belong to the stupid sluggish
Germanic race, but to a braver, taller, and handsomer people;" here taking the pipe out of
his mouth, he stood up proudly erect, so that his head nearly touched the ceiling of the room,
then reseating himself, and again putting the syphon to his lips, he added, "I am a Magyar."

"What is that?" said I.

The foreigner looked at me for a moment, somewhat contemptuously, through the smoke, then said,
in a voice of thunder, "A Hungarian!"

"What a voice the chap has when he pleases!" interposed the jockey; "what is he saying?"

"Merely that he is a Hungarian," said I; but I added, "the conversation of this gentleman and
myself in a language which you can't understand must be very tedious to you, we had better
give it up."

"Keep on with it," said the jockey, "I shall go on listening very contentedly till I fall asleep,
no bad thing to do at most times."

CHAPTER XXXIX

The Hungarian.

"Then you are a countryman of Tekeli, and of the queen who made the celebrated water," said
I, speaking to the Hungarian in German, which I was able to do tolerably well, owing to my
having translated the Publisher's philosophy into that language, always provided I did not
attempt to say much at a time.

Hungarian.  Ah! you have heard of Tekeli, and of L'eau de la Reine d'Hongrie.  How is that?

Myself.  I have seen a play acted, founded on the exploits of Tekeli, and have read Pigault
Le Brun's beautiful romance, entitled the "Barons of Felsheim," in which he is mentioned. 
As for the water, I have heard a lady, the wife of a master of mine, speak of it.

Hungarian.  Was she handsome?

Myself.  Very.

Hungarian.  Did she possess the water?

Myself.  I should say not; for I have heard her express a great curiosity about it.

Hungarian.  Was she growing old?

Myself.  Of course not; but why do you put all these questions?

Hungarian.  Because the water is said to make people handsome, and above all, to restore to
the aged the beauty of their youth.  Well! Tekeli was my countryman, and I have the honour
of having some of the blood of the Tekelis in my veins, but with respect to the queen, pardon
me if I tell you that she was not an Hungarian; she was a Pole--Ersebet by name, daughter of
Wladislaus Locticus King of Poland; she was the fourth spouse of Caroly the Second, King of
the Magyar country, who married her in 1320.  She was a great woman and celebrated politician,
though at present chiefly known by her water.

Myself.  How came she to invent it?

Hungarian.  If her own account may be believed, she did not invent it. After her death, as
I have read in Florentius of Buda, there was found a statement of the manner in which she came
by it, written in her own hand, on a fly-leaf of her breviary, to the following effect:--Being
afflicted with a grievous disorder at the age of seventy-two, she received the medicine which
was called her water, from an old hermit whom she never saw before or afterwards; it not only
cured her, but restored to her all her former beauty, so that the King of Poland fell in love
with her, and made her an offer of marriage, which she refused for the glory of God, from whose
holy angel she believed she had received the water.  The receipt for making it and directions
for using it, were also found on the fly-leaf.  The principal component parts were burnt wine
and rosemary, passed through an alembic; a drachm of it was to be taken once a week, "etelbenn
vagy italbann," in the food or the drink, early in the morning, and the cheeks were to be moistened
with it every day.  The effects according to the statement, were wonderful--and perhaps they
were upon the queen; but whether the water has been equally efficacious on other people, is
a point which I cannot determine.  I should wish to see some old woman who has been restored
to youthful beauty by the use of L'eau de la Reine d'Hongrie.

Myself.  Perhaps, if you did, the old gentlewoman would hardly be so ingenuous as the queen.
But who are the Hungarians--descendants of Attila and his people?

The Hungarian shook his head, and gave me to understand that he did not believe that his nation
were the descendants of Attila and his people, though he acknowledged that they were probably
of the same race.  Attila and his armies, he said, came and disappeared in a very mysterious
manner, and that nothing could be said with positiveness about them; that the people now known
as Magyars first made their appearance in Muscovy in the year 884, under the leadership of
Almus, called so from Alom, which, in the Hungarian language, signifies a dream; his mother,
before his birth, having dreamt that the child with which she was enceinte would be the father
of a long succession of kings, which, in fact, was the case; that after beating the Russians
he entered Hungary, and coming to a place called Ungvar, from which many people believed that
modern Hungary derived its name, he captured it, and held in it a grand festival, which lasted
four days, at the end of which time he resigned the leadership of the Magyars to his son Arpad.
This Arpad and his Magyars utterly subdued Pannonia--that is, Hungary and Transylvania, wresting
the government of it from the Sclavonian tribes who inhabited it, and settling down amongst
them as conquerors!  After giving me this information, the Hungarian exclaimed with much animation,--"A
goodly country that which they had entered on, consisting of a plain surrounded by mountains,
some of which intersect it here and there, with noble rapid rivers, the grandest of which is
the mighty Dunau; a country with tiny volcanoes, casting up puffs of smoke and steam, and from
which hot springs arise, good for the sick; with many fountains, some of which are so pleasant
to the taste as to be preferred to wine; with a generous soil which, warmed by a beautiful
sun, is able to produce corn, grapes, and even the Indian weed; in fact, one of the finest
countries in the world, which even a Spaniard would pronounce to be nearly equal to Spain.
Here they rested--meditating, however, fresh conquests.  Oh, the Magyars soon showed themselves
a mighty people.  Besides Hungary and Transylvania, they subdued Bulgaria and Bosnia, and the
land of Tot, now called Sclavonia.  The generals of Zoltan, the son of Arpad, led troops of
horsemen to the banks of the Rhine.  One of them, at the head of a host, besieged Constantinople.
It was then that Botond engaged in combat with a Greek of gigantic stature, who came out of
the city and challenged the two best men in the Magyar army.  'I am the feeblest of the Magyars,'
said Botond, 'but I will kill thee;' and he performed his word, having previously given a proof
of the feebleness of his arm by striking his battle-axe through the brazen gate, making a hole
so big that a child of five years old could walk through it."

Myself.  Of what religion were the old Hungarians?

Hungarian.  They had some idea of a Supreme Being, whom they called Isten, which word is still
used by the Magyars for God; but their chief devotion was directed to sorcerers and soothsayers,
something like the Schamans of the Siberian steppes.  They were converted to Christianity chiefly
through the instrumentality of Istvan or Stephen, called after his death St. Istvan, who ascended
the throne in the year one thousand. He was born in heathenesse, and his original name was
Vojk: he was the first kiraly, or king of the Magyars.  Their former leaders had been called
fejedelmek, or dukes.  The Magyar language has properly no term either for king or house. 
Kiraly is a word derived from the Sclaves; haz, or house, from the Germans, who first taught
them to build houses, their original dwellings having been tilted waggons.

Myself.  Many thanks for your account of the great men of your country.

Hungarian.  The great men of my country!  I have only told you of the-- Well, I acknowledge
that Almus and Arpad were great men, but Hungary has produced many greater; I will not trouble
you by recapitulating all, but there is one name I cannot forbear mentioning--but you have
heard of it--even at Horncastle, the name of Hunyadi must be familiar.

Myself.  It may be so, though I rather doubt it; but, however that may be, I confess my ignorance.
I have never, until this moment, heard the name of Hunyadi.

Hungarian.  Not of Hunyadi Janos, not of Hunyadi John--for the genius of our language compels
us to put a man's Christian name after his other; perhaps you have heard of the name of Corvinus?

Myself.  Yes, I have heard the name of Corvinus.

Hungarian.  By my God, I am glad of it; I thought our hammer of destruction, our thunderbolt,
whom the Greeks called Achilles, must be known to the people of Horncastle.  Well, Hunyadi
and Corvinus are the same.

Myself.  Corvinus means the man of the crow, or raven.  I suppose that your John, when a boy,
climbed up to a crow or a raven's nest, and stole the young; a bold feat, well befitting a
young hero.

Hungarian.  By Isten, you are an acute guesser; a robbery there was, but it was not Hunyadi
who robbed the raven, but the raven who robbed Hunyadi.

Myself.  How was that?

Hungarian.  In this manner: Hunyadi, according to tradition, was the son of King Sigmond, by
a peasant's daughter.  The king saw and fell in love with her, whilst marching against the
vaivode of Wallachia.  He had some difficulty in persuading her to consent to his wishes, and
she only yielded at last, on the king making her a solemn promise that, in the event of her
becoming with child by him, he would handsomely provide for her and the infant.  The king proceeded
on his expedition; and on his returning in triumph from Wallachia, again saw the girl, who
informed him that she was enceinte by him; the king was delighted with the intelligence, gave
the girl money, and at the same time a ring, requesting her, if she brought forth a son, to
bring the ring to Buda with the child, and present it to him.  When her time was up, the peasant's
daughter brought forth a fair son, who was baptized by the name of John.  After some time the
young woman communicated the whole affair to her elder brother, whose name was Gaspar, and
begged him to convey her and the child to the king at Buda.  The brother consented, and both
set out, taking the child with them.  On their way, the woman, wanting to wash her clothes,
laid the child down, giving it the king's ring to play with.  A raven, who saw the glittering
ring, came flying, and plucking it out of the child's hand, carried it up into a tree; the
child suddenly began to cry, and the mother, hearing it, left her washing, and running to the
child, forthwith missed the ring, but hearing the raven croak in the tree, she lifted up her
eyes, and saw it with the ring in its beak. The woman, in great terror, called her brother,
and told him what had happened, adding that she durst not approach the king if the raven took
away the ring.  Gaspar, seizing his cross-bow and quiver, ran to the tree, where the raven
was yet with the ring, and discharged an arrow at it, but, being in a great hurry, he missed
it; with his second shot he was more lucky, for he hit the raven in the breast, which, together
with the ring, fell to the ground.  Taking up the ring, they went on their way, and shortly
arrived at Buda.  One day, as the king was walking after dinner in his outer hall, the woman
appeared before him with the child, and, showing him the ring, said, "Mighty lord! behold this
token! and take pity upon me and your own son."  King Sigmond took the child and kissed it,
and, after a pause, said to the mother, "You have done right in bringing me the boy; I will
take care of you, and make him a nobleman."  The king was as good as his word, he provided
for the mother; caused the boy to be instructed in knightly exercises, and made him a present
of the town of Hunyad, in Transylvania, on which account he was afterwards called Hunyadi,
and gave him, as an armorial sign, a raven bearing a ring in his beak.

Such, oh young man of Horncastle! is the popular account of the birth of the great captain
of Hungary, as related by Florentius of Buda.  There are other accounts of his birth, which
is, indeed, involved in much mystery, and of the reason of his being called Corvinus, but as
this is the most pleasing, and is, upon the whole, founded on quite as good evidence as the
others, I have selected it for recitation.

Myself.  I heartily thank you; but you must tell me something more of Hunyadi.  You call him
your great captain; what did he do?

Hungarian.  Do! what no other man of his day could have done.  He broke the power of the Turk
when he was coming to overwhelm Europe.  From the blows inflicted by Hunyadi, the Turk never
thoroughly recovered; he has been frequently worsted in latter times, but none but Hunyadi
could have routed the armies of Amurath and Mahomed the Second.

Myself.  How was it that he had an opportunity of displaying his military genius?

Hungarian.  I can hardly tell you, but his valour soon made him famous; King Albert made him
Ban of Szorenyi.  He became eventually waivode of Transylvania, and governor of Hungary.  His
first grand action was the defeat of Bashaw Isack; and though himself surprised and routed
at St. Imre, he speedily regained his prestige by defeating the Turks, with enormous slaughter,
killing their leader, Mezerbeg; and subsequently, at the battle of the Iron Gates, he destroyed
ninety thousand Turks, sent by Amurath to avenge the late disgrace.  It was then that the Greeks
called him Achilles.

Myself.  He was not always successful.

Hungarian.  Who could be always successful against the early Turk?  He was defeated in the
battle in which King Vladislaus lost his life, but his victories outnumbered his defeats three-fold.
His grandest victory--perhaps the grandest ever achieved by man--was over the terrible Mahomed
the Second; who, after the taking of Constantinople in 1453, said, "One God in Heaven--one
king on earth;" and marched to besiege Belgrade at the head of one hundred, and fifty thousand
men; swearing by the beard of the prophet, "That he would sup within it ere two months were
elapsed."  He brought with him dogs, to eat the bodies of the Christians whom he should take
or slay; so says Florentius; hear what he also says: The Turk sat down before the town towards
the end of June, 1454, covering the Dunau and Szava with ships: and on the 4th of July he began
to cannonade Belgrade with cannons twenty-five feet long, whose roar could be heard at Szeged,
a distance of twenty-four leagues, at which place Hunyadi had assembled his forces.  Hunyadi
had been able to raise only fifteen thousand of well-armed and disciplined men, though he had
with him vast bands of people, who called themselves Soldiers of the Cross, but who consisted
of inexperienced lads from school, peasants, and hermits, armed with swords, slings, and clubs.
Hunyadi, undismayed by the great disparity between his forces and those of the Turk, advanced
to relieve Belgrade, and encamped at Szalankemen with his army.  There he saw at once, that
his first step must be to attack the flotilla; he therefore privately informed Szilagy, his
wife's brother, who at that time defended Belgrade, that it was his intention to attack the
ships of the Turks on the 14th day of July in front, and requested his co-operation in the
rear.  On the 14th came on the commencement of the great battle of Belgrade, between Hunyadi
and the Turk.  Many days it lasted.

Myself.  Describe it.

Hungarian.  I cannot.  One has described it well--Florentius of Buda.  I can only repeat a
few of his words:--"On the appointed day, Hunyadi, with two hundred vessels, attacked the Turkish
flotilla in front, whilst Szilagy, with forty vessels, filled with the men of Belgrade, assailed
it in the rear; striving for the same object, they sunk many of the Turkish vessels, captured
seventy-four, burnt many, and utterly annihilated the whole fleet.  After this victory, Hunyadi,
with his army, entered Belgrade, to the great joy of the Magyars.  But though the force of
Mahomed upon the water was destroyed, that upon the land remained entire; and with this, during
six days and nights, he attacked the city without intermission, destroying its walls in many
parts.  His last and most desperate assault was made on the 21st day of July.  Twice did the
Turks gain possession of the outer town, and twice was it retaken with indescribable slaughter.
The next day the combat raged without ceasing till mid-day, when the Turks were again beaten
out of the town, and pursued by the Magyars to their camp.  There the combat was renewed, both
sides displaying the greatest obstinacy, until Mahomed received a great wound over his left
eye.  The Turks then, turning their faces, fled, leaving behind them three hundred cannon in
the hands of the Christians, and more than twenty-four thousand slain on the field of battle."

Myself.  After that battle, I suppose Hunyadi enjoyed his triumphs in peace?

Hungarian.  In the deepest, for he shortly died.  His great soul quitted his body, which was
exhausted by almost superhuman exertions, on the 11th of August, 1456.  Shortly before he died,
according to Florentius, a comet appeared, sent, as it would seem, to announce his coming end.
The whole Christian world mourned his loss.  The Pope ordered the cardinals to perform a funeral
ceremony at Rome in his honour.  His great enemy himself grieved for him, and pronounced his
finest eulogium.  When Mahomed the Second heard of his death, he struck his head for some time
against the ground without speaking.  Suddenly he broke silence with these words, "Notwithstanding
he was my enemy, yet do I bewail his loss; since the sun has shone in heaven, no Prince had
ever yet such a man."

Myself.  What was the name of his Prince?

Hungarian.  Laszlo the Fifth; who, though under infinite obligations to Hunyadi, was anything
but grateful to him; for he once consented to a plan which was laid to assassinate him, contrived
by his mortal enemy Ulrik, Count of Cilejia; and after Hunyadi's death, caused his eldest son,
Hunyadi Laszlo, to be executed on a false accusation, and imprisoned his younger son, Matyas,
who, on the death of Laszlo, was elected by the Magyars to be their king, on the 24th of January,
1458.

Myself.  Was this Matyas a good king?

Hungarian.  Was Matyas Corvinus a good king?  O young man of Horncastle! he was the best and
greatest that ever Hungary possessed, and, after his father, the most renowned warrior,--some
of our best laws were framed by him.  It was he who organized the Hussar force, and it was
he who took Vienna.  Why does your Government always send fools to represent it at Vienna?

Myself.  I really cannot say; but with respect to the Hussar force, is it of Hungarian origin?

Hungarian.  Its name shows its origin.  Huz, in Hungarian, is twenty and the Hussar force is
so called because it is formed of twentieths.  A law was issued by which it was ordered that
every Hungarian nobleman, out of every twenty dependents, should produce a well-equipped horseman,
and with him proceed to the field of battle.

Myself.  Why did Matyas capture Venna?

Hungarian.  Because the Emperor Frederick took part against him with the King of Poland, who
claimed the kingdom of Hungary for his son, and had also assisted the Turk.  He captured it
in the year 1487, but did not survive his triumph long, expiring there in the year 1490.  He
was so veracious a man, that it was said of him, after his death, "Truth died with Matyas."
It might be added that the glory of Hungary departed with him.  I wish to say nothing more
connected with Hungarian history.

Myself.  Another word.  Did Matyas leave a son?

Hungarian.  A natural son, Hunyadi John, called so after the great man. He would have been
universally acknowledged as King of Hungary but for the illegitimacy of his birth.  As it was,
Ulaszlo, the son of the King of Poland, afterwards called Ulaszlo the Second, who claimed Hungary
as being descended from Albert, was nominated king by a great majority of the Magyar electors.
Hunyadi John for some time disputed the throne with him; there was some bloodshed, but Hunyadi
John eventually submitted, and became the faithful captain of Ulaszlo, notwithstanding that
the Turk offered to assist him with an army of two hundred thousand men.

Myself.  Go on.

Hungarian.  To what?  Tche Drak, to the Mohacs Veszedelem.  Ulaszlo left a son, Lajos the Second,
born without skin, as it is said, certainly without a head.  He, contrary to the advice of
all his wise counsellors,--and amongst them was Batory Stephen, who became eventually King
of Poland--engaged, with twenty-five thousand men, at Mohacs, Soliman the Turk, who had an
army of two hundred thousand.  Drak! the Magyars were annihilated, King Lajos disappeared with
his heavy horse and armour in a bog.  We call that battle, which was fought on the 29th of
August, 1526, the destruction of Mohacs, but it was the destruction of Hungary.

Myself.  You have twice used the word drak, what is the meaning of it? Is it Hungarian?

Hungarian.  No! it belongs to the mad Wallacks.  They are a nation of madmen on the other side
of Transylvania.  Their country was formerly a fief of Hungary, like Moldavia, which is inhabited
by the same race, who speak the same language and are equally mad.

Myself.  What language do they speak?

Hungarian.  A strange mixture of Latin and Sclavonian--they themselves being a mixed race of
Romans and Sclavonians.  Trajan sent certain legions to form military colonies in Dacia; and
the present Wallacks and Moldavians are, to a certain extent, the descendants of the Roman
soldiers, who married the women of the country.  I say to a certain extent, for the Sclavonian
element both in blood and language seems to prevail.

Myself.  And what is drak?

Hungarian.  Dragon; which the Wallacks use for "devil."  The term is curious, as it shows that
the old Romans looked upon the dragon as an infernal being.

Myself.  You have been in Wallachia?

Hungarian.  I have, and glad I was to get out of it.  I hate the mad Wallacks.

Myself.  Why do you call them mad?

Hungarian.  They are always drinking or talking.  I never saw a Wallachian eating or silent.
They talk like madmen, and drink like madmen.  In drinking they use small phials, the contents
of which they pour down their throats.  When I first went amongst them I thought the whole
nation was under a course of physic, but the terrible jabber of their tongues soon undeceived
me.  Drak was the first word I heard on entering Dacia, and the last when I left it.  The Moldaves,
if possible, drink more, and talk more than the Wallachians.

Myself.  It is singular enough that the only Moldavian I have known could not speak.  I suppose
he was born dumb.

Hungarian.  A Moldavian born dumb!  Excuse me, the thing is impossible,--all Moldavians are
born talking!  I have known a Moldavian who could not speak, but he was not born dumb.  His
master, an Armenian, snipped off part of his tongue at Adrianople.  He drove him mad with his
jabber.  He is now in London, where his master has a house.  I have letters of credit on the
house: the clerk paid me money in London, the master was absent; the money which you received
for the horse belonged to that house.

Myself.  Another word with respect to Hungarian history.

Hungarian.  Drak!  I wish to say nothing more about Hungarian history.

Myself.  The Turk, I suppose, after Mohacs, got possession of Hungary?

Hungarian.  Not exactly.  The Turk, upon the whole, showed great moderation; not so the Austrian.
Ferdinand the First claimed the crown of Hungary as being the cousin of Maria, widow of Lajos;
he found too many disposed to support him.  His claim, however, was resisted by Zapolya John,
a Hungarian magnate, who caused himself to be elected king. Hungary was for a long time devastated
by wars between the partisans of Zapolya and Ferdinand.  At last Zapolya called in the Turk.
Soliman behaved generously to him, and after his death befriended his young son, and Isabella
his queen; eventually the Turks became masters of Transylvania and the greater part of Hungary.
They were not bad masters, and had many friends in Hungary, especially amongst those of the
reformed faith, to which I have myself the honour of belonging; those of the reformed faith
found the Mufti more tolerant than the Pope.  Many Hungarians went with the Turks to the siege
of Vienna, whilst Tekeli and his horsemen guarded Hungary for them.  A gallant enterprise that
siege of Vienna, the last great effort of the Turk; it failed, and he speedily lost Hungary,
but he did not sneak from Hungary like a frightened hound. His defence of Buda will not be
soon forgotten, where Apty Basha, the governor, died fighting like a lion in the breach.  There's
many a Hungarian would prefer Stamboul to Vienna.  Why does your Government always send fools
to represent it at Vienna?

Myself.  I have already told you that I cannot say.  What became of Tekeli?

Hungarian.  When Hungary was lost he retired with the Turks into Turkey.  Count Renoncourt,
in his Memoirs, mentions having seen him at Adrianople.  The Sultan, in consideration of the
services which he had rendered to the Moslem in Hungary, made over the revenues of certain
towns and districts for his subsistence.  The count says that he always went armed to the teeth,
and was always attended by a young female dressed in male attire, who had followed him in his
wars, and had more than once saved his life.  His end is wrapped in mystery, I--whose greatest
boast, next to being a Hungarian, is to be of his blood--know nothing of his end.

Myself.  Allow me to ask who you are?

Hungarian.  Egy szegeny Magyar Nemes ember, a poor Hungarian nobleman, son of one yet poorer.
I was born in Transylvania, not far to the west of good Coloscvar.  I served some time in the
Austrian army as a noble Hussar, but am now equerry to a great nobleman, to whom I am distantly
related.  In his service I have travelled far and wide, buying horses.  I have been in Russia
and in Turkey, and am now at Horncastle, where I have had the satisfaction to meet with you,
and to buy your horse, which is, in truth, a noble brute.

Myself.  For a soldier and equerry you seem to know a great deal of the history of your country.

Hungarian.  All I know is derived from Florentius of Buda, whom we call Budai Ferentz.  He
was professor of Greek and Latin at the Reformed College of Debreczen, where I was educated;
he wrote a work entitled "Magyar Polgari Lexicon," Lives of Great Hungarian Citizens.  He was
dead before I was born, but I found his book, when I was a child, in the solitary home of my
father, which stood on the confines of a puszta, or wilderness, and that book I used to devour
in winter nights when the winds were whistling around the house.  Oh! how my blood used to
glow at the descriptions of Magyar valour, and likewise of Turkish; for Florentius has always
done justice to the Turk.  Many a passage similar to this have I got by heart; it is connected
with a battle on the plain of Rigo, which Hunyadi lost:--"The next day, which was Friday, as
the two armies were drawn up in battle array, a Magyar hero riding forth, galloped up and down,
challenging the Turks to single combat.  Then came out to meet him the son of a renowned bashaw
of Asia; rushing upon each other, both broke their lances, but the Magyar hero and his horse
rolled over upon the ground, for the Turks had always the best horses."  O young man of Horncastle!
if ever you learn Hungarian--and learn it assuredly you will after what I have told you--read
the book of Florentius of Buda, even if you go to Hungary to get it, for you will scarcely
find it elsewhere, and even there with difficulty, for the book has been long out of print.
It describes the actions of the great men of Hungary down to the middle of the sixteenth century;
and besides being written in the purest Hungarian, has the merit of having for its author a
professor of the Reformed College of Debreczen.

Myself.  I will go to Hungary rather than not read it.  I am glad that the Turk beat the Magyar.
When I used to read the ballads of Spain I always sided with the Moor against the Christian.

Hungarian.  It was a drawn fight after all, for the terrible horse of the Turk presently flung
his own master, whereupon the two champions returned to their respective armies; but in the
grand conflict which ensued, the Turks beat the Magyars, pursuing them till night, and striking
them on the necks with their scymetars.  The Turk is a noble fellow; I should wish to be a
Turk, were I not a Magyar.

Myself.  The Turk always keeps his word, I am told.

Hungarian.  Which the Christian very seldom does, and even the Hungarian does not always. 
In 1444 Ulaszlo made, at Szeged, peace with Amurath for ten years, which he swore with an oath
to keep, but at the instigation of the Pope Julian he broke it, and induced his great captain,
Hunyadi John, to share in the perjury.  The consequence was the battle of Varna, of the 10th
of November, in which Hunyadi was routed, and Ulaszlo slain.  Did you ever hear his epitaph?
it is both solemn and edifying:--

   Romulidae Cannas ego Varnam clade notavi;
   Discite mortales non temerare fidem:
   Me nisi Pontifices jussissent rumpere foedus
   Non ferret Scythicum Pannonis ora jugum."

"Halloo!" said the jockey, starting up from a doze in which he had been indulging for the last
hour, his head leaning upon his breast, "what is that?  That's not high Dutch; I bargained
for high Dutch, and I left you speaking high Dutch, as it sounded very much like the language
of horses, as I have been told high Dutch does; but as for what you are speaking now, whatever
you may call it, it sounds more like the language of another kind of animal.  I suppose you
want to insult me, because I was once a dicky-boy."

"Nothing of the kind," said I; "the gentleman was making a quotation in Latin."

"Latin, was it?" said the jockey; "that alters the case.  Latin is genteel, and I have sent
my eldest boy to an academy to learn it.  Come, let us hear you fire away in Latin," he continued,
proceeding to re-light his pipe, which, before going to sleep, he had laid on the table.

"If you wish to follow the discourse in Latin," said the Hungarian, in very bad English, "I
can oblige you; I learned to speak very good Latin in the college of Debreczen."

"That's more," said I, "than I have done in the colleges where I have been; in any little conversation
which we may yet have, I wish you would use German."

"Well," said the jockey, taking a whiff, "make your conversation as short as possible, whether
in Latin or Dutch, for, to tell you the truth, I am rather tired of merely playing listener."

"You were saying you had been in Russia," said I; "I believe the Russians are part of the Sclavonian
race."

Hungarian.  Yes, part of the great Sclavonian family; one of the most numerous races in the
world.  The Russians themselves are very numerous; would that the Magyars could boast of the
fifth part of their number!

Myself.  What is the number of the Magyars?

Hungarian.  Barely four millions.  We came a tribe of Tartars into Europe, and settled down
amongst Sclavonians, whom we conquered, but who never coalesced with us.  The Austrian at present
plays in Pannonia the Sclavonian against us, and us against the Sclavonian; but the downfall
of the Austrian is at hand; they, like us, are not a numerous people.

Myself.  Who will bring about his downfall?

Hungarian.  The Russians.  The Rysckie Tsar will lead his people forth, all the Sclavonians
will join him, he will conquer all before him.

Myself.  Are the Russians good soldiers?

Hungarian.  They are stubborn and unflinching to an astonishing degree, and their fidelity
to their Tsar is quite admirable.  See how the Russians behaved at Plescova, in Livonia, in
the old time, against our great Batory Stephen; they defended the place till it was a heap
of rubbish, and mark how they behaved after they had been made prisoners. Stephen offered them
two alternatives:--to enter into his service, in which they would have good pay, clothing,
and fair treatment; or to be allowed to return to Russia.  Without the slightest hesitation
they, to a man, chose the latter, though well aware that their beloved Tsar, the cruel Ivan
Basilowits, would put them all to death, amidst tortures the most horrible, for not doing what
was impossible--preserving the town.

Myself.  You speak Russian?

Hungarian.  A little.  I was born in the vicinity of a Sclavonian tribe; the servants of our
house were Sclavonians, and I early acquired something of their language, which differs not
much from that of Russia; when in that country I quickly understood what was said.

Myself.  Have the Russians any literature?

Hungarian.  Doubtless; but I am not acquainted with it, as I do not read their language; but
I know something of their popular tales, to which I used to listen in their izbushkas; a principal
personage in these is a creation quite original--called Baba Yaga.

Myself.  Who is the Baba Yaga?

Hungarian.  A female phantom, who is described as hurrying along the puszta, or steppe, in
a mortar, pounding with a pestle at a tremendous rate, and leaving a long trace on the ground
behind her with her tongue, which is three yards long, and with which she seizes any men and
horses coming in her way, swallowing them down into her capacious belly.  She has several daughters,
very handsome, and with plenty of money; happy the young Mujik who catches and marries one
of them, for they make excellent wives.

"Many thanks," said I, "for the information you have afforded me: this is rather poor wine,"
I observed, as I poured out a glass--"I suppose you have better wine in Hungary?"

"Yes, we have better wine in Hungary.  First of all there is Tokay, the most celebrated in
the world, though I confess I prefer the wine of Eger--Tokay is too sweet."

"Have you ever been at Tokay?"

"I have," said the Hungarian.

"What kind of place is Tokay?"

"A small town situated on the Tyzza, a rapid river descending from the north; the Tokay Mountain
is just behind the town, which stands on the right bank.  The top of the mountain is called
Kopacs Teto, or the bald tip; the hill is so steep that during thunder-storms pieces frequently
fall down upon the roofs of the houses.  It was planted with vines by King Lajos, who ascended
the throne in 1342.  The best wine called Tokay is, however, not made at Tokay, but at Kassau,
two leagues farther into the Carpathians, of which Tokay is a spur.  If you wish to drink the
best Tokay, you must go to Vienna, to which place all the prime is sent.  For the third time
I ask you, O young man of Horncastle! why does your Government always send fools to represent
it at Vienna?"

"And for the third time I tell you, O son of Almus! that I cannot say; perhaps, however, to
drink the sweet Tokay wine; fools, you know, always like sweet things."

"Good," said the Hungarian; "it must be so, and when I return to Hungary, I will state to my
countrymen your explanation of a circumstance which has frequently caused them great perplexity.
Oh! the English are a clever people, and have a deep meaning in all they do.  What a vision
of deep policy opens itself to my view! they do not send their fool to Vienna in order to gape
at processions, and to bow and scrape at a base Papist court, but to drink at the great dinners
the celebrated Tokay of Hungary, which the Hungarians, though they do not drink it, are very
proud of, and by doing so to intimate the sympathy which the English entertain for their fellow
religionists of Hungary.  Oh! the English are a deep people."

CHAPTER XL

The Horncastle Welcome--Tzernebock and Bielebock.

The pipe of the Hungarian had, for some time past, exhibited considerable symptoms of exhaustion,
little or no ruttling having been heard in the tube, and scarcely a particle of smoke, drawn
through the syphon, having been emitted from the lips of the possessor.  He now rose from his
seat, and going to a corner of the room, placed his pipe against the wall, then striding up
and down the room, he cracked his fingers several times, exclaiming, in a half-musing manner,
"Oh, the deep nation, which, in order to display its sympathy for Hungary, sends its fool to
Vienna, to drink the sweet wine of Tokay!"

The jockey, having looked for some time at the tall figure with evident approbation, winked
at me with that brilliant eye of his on which there was no speck, saying, "'Did you ever see
a taller fellow?"

"Never," said I.

"Or a finer?"

"That's another question," said I, "which I am not so willing to answer; however, as I am fond
of truth, and scorn to flatter, I will take the liberty of saying that I have seen a finer."

"A finer! where?" said the jockey; whilst the Hungarian, who appeared to understand what we
said, stood still, and looked full at me.

"Amongst a strange set of people," said I, "whom, if I were to name, you would, I dare say,
only laugh at me."

"Who be they?" said the jockey.  "Come, don't be ashamed; I have occasionally kept queerish
company myself."

"The people whom we call gypsies," said I; "whom the Germans call Zigeuner, and who call themselves
Romany chals."

"Zigeuner!" said the Hungarian; "by Isten!  I do know those people."

"Romany chals!" said the jockey; "whew!  I begin to smell a rat."

"What do you mean by smelling a rat?" said I.

"I'll bet a crown," said the jockey, "that you be the young chap what certain folks call 'the
Romany Rye.'"

"Ah!" said I, "how came you to know that name?"

"Be not you he?" said the jockey.

"Why, I certainly have been called by that name."

"I could have sworn it," said the jockey; then rising from his chair, he laid his pipe on the
table, took a large hand-bell which stood on the side-board, and going to the door, opened
it, and commenced ringing in a most tremendous manner on the staircase.  The noise presently
brought up a waiter, to whom the jockey vociferated, "Go to your master, and tell him to send
immediately three bottles of champagne, of the pink kind, mind you, which is twelve guineas
a dozen;" the waiter hurried away, and the jockey resumed his seat and his pipe.  I sat in
silent astonishment until the waiter returned with a basket containing the wine, which, with
three long glasses, he placed on the table.  The jockey then got up, and going to a large bow-window
at the end of the room, which looked into a court-yard, peeped out; then saying, "the coast
is clear," he shut down the principal sash which was open for the sake of the air, and taking
up a bottle of champagne, he placed another in the hands of the Hungarian, to whom he said
something in private.  The latter, who seemed to understand him, answered by a nod.  The two
then going to the end of the table fronting the window, and about eight paces from it, stood
before it, holding the bottles by their necks; suddenly the jockey lifted up his arm.  "Surely,"
said I, "you are not mad enough to fling that bottle through the window?"  "Here's to the Romany
Rye; here's to the sweet master," said the jockey, dashing the bottle through the pane in so
neat a manner that scarcely a particle of glass fell into the room.

"Eljen edes csigany ur--eljen gul eray!" said the Hungarian, swinging round his bottle, and
discharging it at the window; but, either not possessing the jockey's accuracy of aim, or reckless
of the consequences, he flung his bottle so, that it struck against part of the wooden setting
of the panes, breaking along with the wood and itself three or four panes to pieces.  The crash
was horrid, and wine and particles of glass flew back into the room, to the no small danger
of its inmates.  "What do you think of that?" said the jockey; "were you ever so honoured before?"
"Honoured!" said I.  "God preserve me in future from such honour;" and I put my finger to my
cheek, which was slightly hurt by a particle of the glass.  "That's the way we of the cofrady
honour great men at Horncastle," said the jockey.  "What, you are hurt! never mind; all the
better; your scratch shows that you are the body the compliment was paid to."  "And what are
you going to do with the other bottle?" said I.  "Do with it!" said the jockey, "why, drink
it, cosily and comfortably, whilst holding a little quiet talk.  The Romany Rye at Horncastle,
what an idea!"

"And what will the master of the house say to all this damage which you have caused him!"

"What will your master say, William?" said the jockey to the waiter, who had witnessed the
singular scene just described without exhibiting the slightest mark of surprise.  William smiled,
and slightly shrugging his shoulders, replied, "Very little, I dare say, sir; this a'n't the
first time your honour has done a thing of this kind."  "Nor will it be the first time that
I shall have paid for it," said the jockey; "well, I shall never have paid for a certain item
in the bill with more pleasure than I shall pay for it now.  Come, William, draw the cork,
and let us taste the pink champagne."

The waiter drew the cork, and filled the glasses with a pinky liquor, which bubbled, hissed,
and foamed.  "How do you like it?" said the jockey, after I had imitated the example of my
companions, by despatching my portion at a draught.

"It is wonderful wine," said I; "I have never tasted champagne before, though I have frequently
heard it praised; it more than answers my expectations; but, I confess, I should not wish to
be obliged to drink it every day."

"Nor I," said the jockey, "for every-day drinking give me a glass of old port, or--"

"Of hard old ale," I interposed, "which, according to my mind, is better than all the wine
in the world."

"Well said, Romany Rye," said the jockey, "just my own opinion; now, William, make yourself
scarce."

The waiter withdrew, and I said to the jockey, "How did you become acquainted with the Romany
chals?"

"I first became acquainted with them," said the jockey, "when I lived with old Fulcher the
basketmaker, who took me up when I was adrift upon the world; I do not mean the present Fulcher,
who is likewise called old Fulcher, but his father, who has been dead this many a year; while
living with him in the caravan, I frequently met them in the green lanes, and of latter years
I have had occasional dealings with them in the horse line."

"And the gypsies have mentioned me to you?" said I.

"Frequently," said the jockey, "and not only those of these parts; why, there's scarcely a
part of England in which I have not heard the name of the Romany Rye mentioned by these people.
The power you have over them is wonderful; that is, I should have thought it wonderful, had
they not more than once told me the cause."

"And what is the cause?" said I, "for I am sure I do not know."

"The cause is this," said the jockey, "they never heard a bad word proceed from your mouth,
and never knew you do a bad thing."

"They are a singular people," said I.

"And what a singular language they have got," said the jockey.

"Do you know it?" said I.

"Only a few words," said the jockey, "they were always chary in teaching me any."

"They were vary sherry to me too," said the Hungarian, speaking in broken English; "I only
could learn from them half-a-dozen words, for example, gul eray, which, in the czigany of my
country, means sweet gentleman; or edes ur in my own Magyar."

"Gudlo Rye, in the Romany of mine, means a sugar'd gentleman," said I; "then there are gypsies
in your country?"

"Plenty," said the Hungarian, speaking German, "and in Russia and Turkey too; and wherever
they are found, they are alike in their ways and language.  Oh, they are a strange race, and
how little known!  I know little of them, but enough to say, that one horse-load of nonsense
has been written about them; there is one Valter Scott--"

"Mind what you say about him," said I; "he is our grand authority in matters of philology and
history."

"A pretty philologist," said the Hungarian, "who makes the gypsies speak Roth-Welsch, the dialect
of thieves; a pretty historian, who couples together Thor and Tzernebock."

"Where does he do that?" said I.

"In his conceited romance of 'Ivanhoe,' he couples Thor and Tzernebock together, and calls
them gods of the heathen Saxons."

"Well," said I, "Thur or Thor was certainly a god of the heathen Saxons."

"True," said the Hungarian; "but why couple him with Tzernebock? Tzernebock was a word which
your Valter had picked up somewhere without knowing the meaning.  Tzernebock was no god of
the Saxons, but one of the gods of the Sclaves, on the southern side of the Baltic.  The Sclaves
had two grand gods to whom they sacrificed, Tzernebock and Bielebock; that is, the black and
white gods, who represented the powers of dark and light.  They were overturned by Waldemar,
the Dane, the great enemy of the Sclaves; the account of whose wars you will find in one fine
old book, written by Saxo Gramaticus, which I read in the library of the college of Debreczen.
The Sclaves, at one time, were masters of all the southern shore of the Baltic, where their
descendants are still to be found, though they have lost their language, and call themselves
Germans; but the word Zernevitz near Dantzic, still attests that the Sclavic language was once
common in those parts.  Zernevitz means the thing of blackness, as Tzernebock means the god
of blackness.  Prussia itself merely means, in Sclavish, Lower Russia.  There is scarcely a
race or language in the world more extended than the Sclavic.  On the other side of the Dunau
you will find the Sclaves and their language.  Czernavoda is Sclavic, and means black water;
in Turkish, kara su; even as Tzernebock means black god; and Belgrade, or Belograd, means the
white town; even as Bielebock, or Bielebog, means the white god.  Oh! he is one great ignorant,
that Valter.  He is going, they say, to write one history about Napoleon.  I do hope that in
his history he will couple his Thor and Tzernebock together.  By my God! it would be good diversion
that."

"Walter Scott appears to be no particular favourite of yours," said I.

"He is not," said the Hungarian; "I hate him for his slavish principles. He wishes to see absolute
power restored in this country, and Popery also--and I hate him because--what do you think?
In one of his novels, published a few months ago, he has the insolence to insult Hungary in
the presence of one of her sons.  He makes his great braggart, Coeur de Lion, fling a Magyar
over his head.  Ha! it was well for Richard that he never felt the gripe of a Hungarian.  I
wish the braggart could have felt the gripe of me, who am 'a' magyarok kozt legkissebb,' the
least among the Magyars.  I do hate that Scott, and all his vile gang of Lowlanders and Highlanders.
The black corps, the fekete regiment of Matyjas Hunyadi, was worth all the Scots, high or low,
that ever pretended to be soldiers; and would have sent them all headlong into the Black Sea,
had they dared to confront it on its shores; but why be angry with an ignorant, who couples
together Thor and Tzernebock?  Ha! Ha!"

"You have read his novels?" said I.

"Yes, I read them now and then.  I do not speak much English, but I can read it well, and I
have read some of his romances, and mean to read his 'Napoleon,' in the hope of finding Thor
and Tzernebock coupled together in it, as in his high-flying 'Ivanhoe.'"

"Come," said the jockey, "no more Dutch, whether high or low.  I am tired of it; unless we
can have some English, I am off to bed."

"I should be very glad to hear some English," said I; "especially from your mouth.  Several
things which you have mentioned, have awakened my curiosity.  Suppose you give us your history?"

"My history?" said the jockey.  "A rum idea! however, lest conversation should lag, I'll give
it you.  First of all, however, a glass of champagne to each."

After we had each taken a glass of champagne, the jockey commenced his history.

CHAPTER XLI

The Jockey's Tale--Thieves' Latin--Liberties with Coin--The Smasher in Prison--Old Fulcher--Every
One has His Gift--Fashion of the English.

"My grandfather was a shorter, and my father was a smasher; the one was scragg'd, and the other
lagg'd."

I here interrupted the jockey by observing that his discourse was, for the greater part, unintelligible
to me.

"I do not understand much English," said the Hungarian, who, having replenished and resumed
his mighty pipe, was now smoking away; "but, by Isten, I believe it is the gibberish which
that great ignorant Valther Scott puts into the mouths of the folks he calls gypsies."

"Something like it, I confess," said I, "though this sounds more genuine than his dialect,
which he picked up out of the canting vocabulary at the end of the 'English Rogue,' a book
which, however despised, was written by a remarkable genius.  What do you call the speech you
were using?" said I, addressing myself to the jockey.

"Latin," said the jockey, very coolly, "that is, that dialect of it which is used by the light-fingered
gentry."

"He is right," said the Hungarian; "it is what the Germans call Roth-Welsch: they call it so
because there are a great many Latin words in it, introduced by the priests, who, at the time
of the Reformation, being too lazy to work and too stupid to preach, joined the bands of thieves
and robbers who prowled about the country.  Italy, as you are aware, is called by the Germans
Welschland, or the land of the Welschers; and I may add that Wallachia derives its name from
a colony of Welschers which Trajan sent there.  Welsch and Wallack being one and the same word,
and tantamount to Latin."

"I dare say you are right," said I; "but why was Italy termed Welschland?"

"I do not know," said the Hungarian.

"Then I think I can tell you," said I; "it was called so because the original inhabitants were
a Cimbric tribe, who were called Gwyltiad, that is, a race of wild people, living in coverts,
who were of the same blood, and spoke the same language as the present inhabitants of Wales.
Welsh seems merely a modification of Gwyltiad.  Pray continue your history," said I to the
jockey, "only please to do so in a language which we can understand, and first of all interpret
the sentence with which you began it."

"I told you that my grandfather was a shorter," said the jockey, "by which is meant a gentleman
who shortens or reduces the current coin of these realms, for which practice he was scragged,
that is, hung by the scrag of the neck.  And when I said that my father was a smasher, I meant
one who passes forged notes, thereby doing his best to smash the Bank of England; by being
lagged, I meant he was laid fast, that is, had a chain put round his leg and then transported."

"Your explanations are quite satisfactory," said I; "the three first words are metaphorical,
and the fourth, lagged, is the old genuine Norse term, lagda, which signifies laid, whether
in durance, or in bed, has nothing to do with the matter.  What you have told me confirms me
in an opinion which I have long entertained, that thieves' Latin is a strange mysterious speech,
formed of metaphorical terms, and words derived from the various ancient languages.  Pray tell
me, now, how the gentleman, your grandfather, contrived to shorten the coin of these realms?"

"You shall hear," said the jockey; "but I have one thing to beg of you, which is, that when
I have once begun my history you will not interrupt me with questions, I don't like them, they
stops one, and puts one out of one's tale, and are not wanted; for anything which I think can't
be understood, I should myself explain, without being asked.  My grandfather reduced or shortened
the coin of this country by three processes.  By aquafortis, by clipping, and by filing.  Filing
and clipping he employed in reducing all sorts of coin, whether gold or silver; but aquafortis
he used merely in reducing gold coin, whether guineas, jacobuses, or Portugal pieces, otherwise
called moidores, which were at one time as current as guineas.  By laying a guinea in aquafortis
for twelve hours, he could filch from it to the value of ninepence, and by letting it remain
there for twenty-four to the value of eighteenpence, the aquafortis eating the gold away, and
leaving it like a sediment in the vessel.  He was generally satisfied with taking the value
of ninepence from a guinea, of eighteenpence from a jacobus or moidore, or half-a-crown from
a broad Spanish piece, whether he reduced them by aquafortis, filing, or clipping.  From a
five-shilling piece, which is called a bull in Latin because it is round like a bull's head,
he would file or clip to the value of fivepence, and from lesser coin in proportion.  He was
connected with a numerous gang, or set, of people, who had given up their minds and talents
entirely to shortening."

Here I interrupted the jockey.  "How singular," said I, "is the fall and debasement of words;
you talk of a gang, or set, of shorters; you are, perhaps, not aware that gang and set were,
a thousand years ago, only connected with the great and Divine; they are ancient Norse words,
which may be found in the heroic poems of the north, and in the Edda, a collection of mythologic
and heroic songs.  In these poems we read that such and such a king invaded Norway with a gang
of heroes; or so and so, for example, Erik Bloodaxe, was admitted to the set of gods; but at
present gang and set are merely applied to the vilest of the vile, and the lowest of the low,--we
say a gang of thieves and shorters, or a set of authors.  How touching is this debasement of
words in the course of time; it puts me in mind of the decay of old houses and names.  I have
known a Mortimer who was a hedger and ditcher, a Berners who was born in a workhouse, and a
descendant of the De Burghs, who bore the falcon, mending old kettles, and making horse and
pony shoes in a dingle."

"Odd enough," said the jockey; "but you were saying you knew one Berners--man or woman?  I
would ask."

"A woman," said I.

"What might her Christian name be?" said the jockey.

"It is not to be mentioned lightly," said I, with a sigh.

"I shouldn't wonder if it were Isopel," said the jockey with an arch glance of his one brilliant
eye.

"It was Isopel," said I; "did you know Isopel Berners?"

"Ay, and have reason to know her," said the jockey, putting his hand into his left waistcoat
pocket, as if to feel for something, "for she gave me what I believe few men could do--a most
confounded whopping.  But now, Mr. Romany Rye, I have again to tell you that I don't like to
be interrupted when I'm speaking, and to add that if you break in upon me a third time, you
and I shall quarrel."

"Pray proceed with your story," said I; "I will not interrupt you again."

"Good!" said the jockey.  "Where was I?  Oh, with a set of people who had given up their minds
to shortening!  Reducing the coin, though rather a lucrative, was a very dangerous trade. 
Coin filed felt rough to the touch; coin clipped could be easily detected by the eye; and as
for coin reduced by aquafortis, it was generally so discoloured that, unless a great deal of
pains was used to polish it, people were apt to stare at it in a strange manner, and to say,
'What have they been doing to this here gold?'  My grandfather, as I have said before, was
connected with a gang of shorters, and sometimes shortened money, and at other times passed
off what had been shortened by other gentry.

"Passing off what had been shortened by others was his ruin; for once, in trying to pass off
a broad piece which had been laid in aquafortis for four-and-twenty hours, and was very black,
not having been properly rectified, he was stopped and searched, and other reduced coins being
found about him, and in his lodgings, he was committed to prison, tried, and executed.  He
was offered his life, provided he would betray his comrades; but he told the big-wigs, who
wanted him to do so, that he would see them farther first, and died at Tyburn, amidst the cheers
of the populace, leaving my grandmother and father, to whom he had always been a kind husband
and parent--for, setting aside the crime for which he suffered, he was a moral man; leaving
them, I say, to bewail his irreparable loss.

"'Tis said that misfortune never comes alone; this is, however, not always the case.  Shortly
after my grandfather's misfortune, as my grandmother and her son were living in great misery
in Spitalfields, her only relation--a brother from whom she had been estranged some years,
on account of her marriage with my grandfather, who had been in an inferior station to herself--died,
leaving all his property to her and the child. This property consisted of a farm of about a
hundred acres, with its stock, and some money besides.  My grandmother, who knew something
of business, instantly went into the country, where she farmed the property for her own benefit
and that of her son, to whom she gave an education suitable to a person in his condition, till
he was old enough to manage the farm himself.  Shortly after the young man came of age, my
grandmother died, and my father, in about a year, married the daughter of a farmer, from whom
he expected some little fortune, but who very much deceived him, becoming a bankrupt almost
immediately after the marriage of his daughter, and himself and family going into the workhouse.

"My mother, however, made my father an excellent wife; and if my father in the long run did
not do well it was no fault of hers.  My father was not a bad man by nature, he was of an easy,
generous temper, the most unfortunate temper, by the bye, for success in this life that any
person can be possessed of, as those who have it are almost sure to be made dupes of by the
designing.  But, though easy and generous, he was anything but a fool; he had a quick and witty
tongue of his own when he chose to exert it, and woe be to those who insulted him openly, for
there was not a better boxer in the whole country round.  My parents were married several years
before I came into the world, who was their first and only child.  I may be called an unfortunate
creature; I was born with this beam or scale on my left eye, which does not allow me to see
with it; and though I can see tolerably sharply with the other, indeed more than most people
can with both of theirs, it is a great misfortune not to have two eyes like other people. 
Moreover, setting aside the affair of my eye, I had a very ugly countenance; my mouth being
slightly wrung aside, and my complexion swarthy.  In fact, I looked so queer that the gossips
and neighbours, when they first saw me, swore I was a changeling--perhaps it would have been
well if I had never been born; for my poor father, who had been particularly anxious to have
a son, no sooner saw me than he turned away, went to the neighbouring town, and did not return
for two days.  I am by no means certain that I was not the cause of his ruin, for till I came
into the world he was fond of his home, and attended much to business, but afterwards he went
frequently into company, and did not seem to care much about his affairs: he was, however,
a kind man, and when his wife gave him advice never struck her, nor do I ever remember that
he kicked me when I came in his way, or so much as cursed my ugly face, though it was easy
to see that he didn't over-like me.  When I was six years old I was sent to the village-school,
where I was soon booked for a dunce, because the master found it impossible to teach me either
to read or write.  Before I had been at school two years, however, I had beaten boys four years
older than myself, and could fling a stone with my left hand (for if I am right-eyed I am left-handed)
higher and farther than any one in the parish. Moreover, no boy could equal me at riding, and
no people ride so well or desperately as boys.  I could ride a donkey--a thing far more difficult
to ride than a horse--at full gallop over hedges and ditches, seated, or rather floating upon
his hinder part,--so, though anything but clever, as this here Romany Rye would say, I was
yet able to do things which few other people could do.  By the time I was ten my father's affairs
had got into a very desperate condition, for he had taken to gambling and horse- racing, and,
being unsuccessful, had sold his stock, mortgaged his estate, and incurred very serious debts.
The upshot was, that within a little time all he had was seized, himself imprisoned, and my
mother and myself put into a cottage belonging to the parish, which, being very cold and damp,
was the cause of her catching a fever, which speedily carried her off.  I was then bound apprentice
to a farmer, in whose service I underwent much coarse treatment, cold, and hunger.

"After lying in prison near two years, my father was liberated by an Act for the benefit of
insolvent debtors; he was then lost sight of for some time; at last, however, he made his appearance
in the neighbourhood dressed like a gentleman, and seemingly possessed of plenty of money.
He came to see me, took me into a field, and asked me how I was getting on. I told him I was
dreadfully used, and begged him to take me away with him; he refused, and told me to be satisfied
with my condition, for that he could do nothing for me.  I had a great love for my father,
and likewise a great admiration for him on account of his character as a boxer, the only character
which boys in general regard, so I wished much to be with him, independently of the dog's life
I was leading where I was; I therefore said if he would not take me with him, I would follow
him; he replied that I must do no such thing, for that if I did, it would be my ruin.  I asked
him what he meant, but he made no reply, only saying that he would go and speak to the farmer.
Then taking me with him, he went to the farmer, and in a very civil manner said that he understood
I had not been very kindly treated by him, but he hoped that in future I should be used better.
The farmer answered in a surly tone, that I had been only too well treated, for that I was
a worthless young scoundrel; high words ensued, and the farmer, forgetting the kind of man
he had to deal with, checked him with my grandsire's misfortune, and said he deserved to be
hanged like his father.  In a moment my father knocked him down, and on his getting up, gave
him a terrible beating, then taking me by the hand he hastened away; as we were going down
a lane he said we were now both done for: 'I don't care a straw for that, father,' said I,
'provided I be with you.'  My father took me to the neighbouring town, and going into the yard
of a small inn, he ordered out a pony and light cart which belonged to him, then paying his
bill, he told me to mount upon the seat, and getting up drove away like lightning; we drove
for at least six hours without stopping, till we came to a cottage by the side of a heath;
we put the pony and cart into a shed, and went into the cottage, my father unlocking the door
with a key which he took out of his pocket; there was nobody in the cottage when we arrived,
but shortly after there came a man and a woman, and then some more people, and by ten o'clock
at night there were a dozen of us in the cottage.  The people were companions of my father.
My father began talking to them in Latin, but I did not understand much of the discourse, though
I believe it was about myself, as their eyes were frequently turned to me.  Some objections
appeared to be made to what he said; however, all at last seemed to be settled, and we all
sat down to some food.  After that, all the people got up and went away, with the exception
of the woman, who remained with my father and me.  The next day my father also departed, leaving
me with the woman, telling me before he went that she would teach me some things which it behoved
me to know.  I remained with her in the cottage upwards of a week; several of those who had
been there coming and going.  The woman, after making me take an oath to be faithful, told
me that the people whom I had seen were a gang who got their livelihood by passing forged notes,
and that my father was a principal man amongst them, adding, that I must do my best to assist
them.  I was a poor ignorant child at that time, and I made no objection, thinking that whatever
my father did must be right; the woman then gave me some instructions in the smasher's dialect
of the Latin language.  I made great progress, because, for the first time in my life, I paid
great attention to my lessons.  At last my father returned, and, after some conversation with
the woman, took me away in his cart.  I shall be very short about what happened to my father
and myself during two years.  My father did his best to smash the Bank of England by passing
forged notes, and I did my best to assist him.  We attended races and fairs in all kinds of
disguises; my father was a first-rate hand at a disguise, and could appear of all ages, from
twenty to fourscore; he was, however, grabbed at last.  He had said, as I have told you, that
he should be my ruin, but I was the cause of his, and all owing to the misfortune of this here
eye of mine.  We came to this very place of Horncastle, where my father purchased two horses
of a young man, paying for them with three forged notes, purporting to be Bank of Englanders
of fifty pounds each, and got the young man to change another of the like amount; he at that
time appeared as a respectable dealer, and I as his son, as I really was.

"As soon as we had got the horses, we conveyed them to one of the places of call belonging
to our gang, of which there were several.  There they were delivered into the hands of our
companions, who speedily sold them in a distant part of the country.  The sum which they fetched--for
the gang kept very regular accounts--formed an important item on the next day of sharing, of
which there were twelve in the year.  The young man, whom my father had paid for the horses
with his smashing notes, was soon in trouble about them, and ran some risk, as I heard, of
being executed; but he bore a good character, told a plain story, and, above all, had friends,
and was admitted to bail; to one of his friends he described my father and myself.  This person
happened to be at an inn in Yorkshire, where my father, disguised as a Quaker, attempted to
pass a forged note. The note was shown to this individual, who pronounced it a forgery, it
being exactly similar to those for which the young man had been in trouble, and which he had
seen.  My father, however, being supposed a respectable man, because he was dressed as a Quaker--the
very reason, by the bye, why anybody who knew aught of the Quakers would have suspected him
to be a rogue--would have been let go, had I not made my appearance, dressed as his footboy.
The friend of the young man looked at my eye, and seized hold of my father, who made a desperate
resistance, I assisting him, as in duty bound.  Being, however, overpowered by numbers, he
bade me by a look, and a word or two in Latin, to make myself scarce. Though my heart was fit
to break, I obeyed my father, who was speedily committed.  I followed him to the county town
in which he was lodged, where shortly after I saw him tried, convicted, and condemned.  I then,
having made friends with the jailor's wife, visited him in his cell, where I found him very
much cast down.  He said, that my mother had appeared to him in a dream, and talked to him
about a resurrection and Christ Jesus; there was a Bible before him, and he told me the chaplain
had just been praying with him.  He reproached himself much, saying, he was afraid he had been
my ruin, by teaching me bad habits.  I told him not to say any such thing, for that I had been
the cause of his, owing to the misfortune of my eye.  He begged me to give over all unlawful
pursuits, saying, that if persisted in, they were sure of bringing a person to destruction.
I advised him to try and make his escape, proposing, that when the turnkey came to let me out,
he should knock him down, and fight his way out, offering to assist him; showing him a small
saw, with which one of our companions, who was in the neighbourhood, had provided me, and with
which he could have cut through his fetters in five minutes; but he told me he had no wish
to escape, and was quite willing to die.  I was rather hard at that time; I am not very soft
now; and I felt rather ashamed of my father's want of what I called spirit.  He was not executed
after all; for the chaplain, who was connected with a great family, stood his friend, and got
his sentence commuted, as they call it, to transportation; and in order to make the matter
easy, he induced my father to make some valuable disclosures with respect to the smashers'
system.  I confess that I would have been hanged before I would have done so, after having
reaped the profit of it; that is, I think so now, seated comfortably in my inn, with my bottle
of champagne before me.  He, however, did not show himself carrion; he would not betray his
companions, who had behaved very handsomely to him, having given the son of a lord, a great
barrister, not a hundred-pound forged bill, but a hundred hard guineas, to plead his cause,
and another ten, to induce him, after pleading, to put his hand to his breast, and say, that,
upon his honour, he believed the prisoner at the bar to be an honest and injured man.  No;
I am glad to be able to say, that my father did not show himself exactly carrion, though I
could almost have wished he had let himself-- However, I am here with my bottle of champagne
and the Romany Rye, and he was in his cell, with bread and water and the prison chaplain. 
He took an affectionate leave of me before he was sent away, giving me three out of five guineas,
all the money he had left.  He was a kind man, but not exactly fitted to fill my grandfather's
shoes.  I afterwards learned that he died of fever, as he was being carried across the sea.

"During the 'sizes I had made acquaintance with old Fulcher.  I was in the town on my father's
account, and he was there on his son's, who, having committed a small larceny, was in trouble.
Young Fulcher, however, unlike my father, got off, though he did not give the son of a lord
a hundred guineas to speak for him, and ten more to pledge his sacred honour for his honesty,
but gave Counsellor P--- one-and-twenty shillings to defend him, who so frightened the principal
evidence, a plain honest farming-man, that he flatly contradicted what he had first said, and
at last acknowledged himself to be all the rogues in the world, and, amongst other things,
a perjured villain.  Old Fulcher, before he left the town with his son,--and here it will be
well to say that he and his son left it in a kind of triumph, the base drummer of a militia
regiment, to whom they had given half-a-crown, beating his drum before them--old Fulcher, I
say, asked me to go and visit him, telling me where, at such a time, I might find him and his
caravan and family; offering, if I thought fit, to teach me basket-making: so, after my father
had been sent off, I went and found up old Fulcher, and became his apprentice in the basket-making
line.  I stayed with him till the time of his death, which happened in about three months,
travelling about with him and his family, and living in green lanes, where we saw gypsies and
trampers, and all kinds of strange characters.  Old Fulcher, besides being an industrious basket-maker,
was an out-and-out thief, as was also his son, and, indeed, every member of his family.  They
used to make baskets during the day, and thieve during a great part of the night.  I had not
been with them twelve hours before old Fulcher told me that I must thieve as well as the rest.
I demurred at first, for I remembered the fate of my father, and what he had told me about
leaving off bad courses, but soon allowed myself to be over-persuaded; more especially as the
first robbery I was asked to do was a fruit robbery.  I was to go with young Fulcher, and steal
some fine Morell cherries, which grew against a wall in a gentleman's garden; so young Fulcher
and I went and stole the cherries, one half of which we ate, and gave the rest to the old man,
who sold them to a fruiterer ten miles off from the place where we had stolen them.  The next
night old Fulcher took me out with himself.  He was a great thief, though in a small way. 
He used to say, that they were fools, who did not always manage to keep the rope below their
shoulders, by which he meant, that it was not advisable to commit a robbery, or do anything
which could bring you to the gallows.  He was all for petty larceny, and knew where to put
his hand upon any little thing in England, which it was possible to steal.  I submit it to
the better judgment of the Romany Rye, who I see is a great hand for words and names, whether
he ought not to have been called old Filcher, instead of Fulcher.  I shan't give a regular
account of the larcenies he committed during the short time I knew him, either alone by himself,
or with me and his son.  I shall merely relate the last.

"A melancholy gentleman, who lived a very solitary life, had a large carp in a shady pond in
a meadow close to his house; he was exceedingly fond of it, and used to feed it with his own
hand, the creature being so tame that it would put its snout out of the water to be fed when
it was whistled to; feeding and looking at his carp were the only pleasures the poor melancholy
gentleman possessed.  Old Fulcher--being in the neighbourhood, and having an order from a fishmonger
for a large fish, which was wanted at a great city dinner, at which His Majesty was to be present--swore
he would steal the carp, and asked me to go with him.  I had heard of the gentleman's fondness
for his creature, and begged him to let it be, advising him to go and steal some other fish;
but old Fulcher swore, and said he would have the carp, although its master should hang himself;
I told him he might go by himself, but he took his son and stole the carp, which weighed seventeen
pounds.  Old Fulcher got thirty shillings for the carp, which I afterwards heard was much admired
and relished by His Majesty.  The master, however, of the carp, on losing his favourite, became
more melancholy than ever, and in a little time hanged himself.  'What's sport for one, is
death to another,' I once heard at the village-school read out of a copy-book.

"This was the last larceny old Fulcher ever committed.  He could keep his neck always out of
the noose, but he could not always keep his leg out of the trap.  A few nights after, having
removed to a distance, he went to an osier car in order to steal some osiers for his basket-making,
for he never bought any.  I followed a little way behind.  Old Fulcher had frequently stolen
osiers out of the car, whilst in the neighbourhood, but during his absence the property, of
which the car was a part, had been let to a young gentleman, a great hand for preserving game.
Old Fulcher had not got far into the car before he put his foot into a man-trap. Hearing old
Fulcher shriek, I ran up, and found him in a dreadful condition.  Putting a large stick which
I carried into the jaws of the trap, I contrived to prize them open, and get old Fulcher's
leg out, but the leg was broken.  So I ran to the caravan, and told young Fulcher of what had
happened, and he and I helped his father home.  A doctor was sent for, who said that it was
necessary to take the leg off, but old Fulcher, being very much afraid of pain, said it should
not be taken off, and the doctor went away, but after some days, old Fulcher becoming worse,
ordered the doctor to be sent for, who came and took off his leg, but it was then too late,
mortification had come on, and in a little time old Fulcher died.

"Thus perished old Fulcher; he was succeeded in his business by his son, young Fulcher, who,
immediately after the death of his father, was called old Fulcher, it being our English custom
to call everybody old, as soon as their fathers are buried; young Fulcher--I mean he who had
been called young, but was now old Fulcher--wanted me to go out and commit larcenies with him;
but I told him that I would have nothing more to do with thieving, having seen the ill effects
of it, and that I should leave them in the morning.  Old Fulcher begged me to think better
of it, and his mother joined with him.  They offered, if I would stay, to give me Mary Fulcher
as a mort, till she and I were old enough to be regularly married, she being the daughter of
the one, and the sister of the other. I liked the girl very well, for she had always been civil
to me, and had a fair complexion and nice red hair, both of which I like, being a bit of a
black myself; but I refused, being determined to see something more of the world than I could
hope to do with the Fulchers, and, moreover, to live honestly, which I could never do along
with them.  So the next morning I left them: I was, as I said before, quite determined upon
an honest livelihood, and I soon found one.  He is a great fool who is ever dishonest in England.
Any person who has any natural gift, and everybody has some natural gift, is sure of finding
encouragement in this noble country of ours, provided he will but exhibit it.  I had not walked
more than three miles before I came to a wonderfully high church steeple, which stood close
by the road; I looked at the steeple, and going to a heap of smooth pebbles which lay by the
roadside, I took up some, and then went into the churchyard, and placing myself just below
the tower, my right foot resting on a ledge, about two foot from the ground, I, with my left
hand--being a left-handed person, do you see--flung or chucked up a stone, which, lighting
on the top of the steeple, which was at least a hundred and fifty feet high, did there remain.
After repeating this feat two or three times, I 'hulled' up a stone, which went clean over
the tower, and then one, my right foot still on the ledge, which rising at least five yards
above the steeple, did fall down just at my feet. Without knowing it, I was showing off my
gift to others besides myself, doing what, perhaps, not five men in England could do.  Two
men, who were passing by, stopped and looked at my proceedings, and when I had done flinging
came into the churchyard, and, after paying me a compliment on what they had seen me do, proposed
that I should join company with them; I asked them who they were, and they told me.  The one
was Hopping Ned, and the other Biting Giles.  Both had their gifts, by which they got their
livelihood; Ned could hop a hundred yards with any man in England, and Giles could lift up
with his teeth any dresser or kitchen-table in the country, and, standing erect, hold it dangling
in his jaws.  There's many a big oak table and dresser in certain districts of England, which
bear the marks of Giles's teeth; and I make no doubt that, a hundred or two years hence, there'll
be strange stories about those marks, and that people will point them out as a proof that there
were giants in bygone time, and that many a dentist will moralize on the decays which human
teeth have undergone.

"They wanted me to go about with them, and exhibit my gift occasionally, as they did theirs,
promising that the money that was got by the exhibitions should be honestly divided.  I consented,
and we set off together, and that evening coming to a village, and putting up at the ale- house,
all the grand folks of the village being there smoking their pipes, we contrived to introduce
the subject of hopping--the upshot being that Ned hopped against the school-master for a pound,
and beat him hollow; shortly after, Giles, for a wager, took up the kitchen table in his jaws,
though he had to pay a shilling to the landlady for the marks he left, whose grandchildren
will perhaps get money by exhibiting them. As for myself, I did nothing that day, but the next,
on which my companions did nothing, I showed off at hulling stones against a cripple, the crack
man for stone-throwing, of a small town, a few miles farther on.  Bets were made to the tune
of some pounds; I contrived to beat the cripple, and just contrived; for to do him justice
I must acknowledge he was a first-rate hand at stones, though he had a game hip, and went sideways;
his head, when he walked--if his movements could be called walking--not being above three feet
above the ground.  So we travelled, I and my companions, showing off our gifts, Giles and I
occasionally for a gathering, but Ned never hopping, unless against somebody for a wager. 
We lived honestly and comfortably, making no little money by our natural endowments, and were
known over a great part of England as 'Hopping Ned,' 'Biting Giles,' and 'Hull over the Head
Jack,' which was my name, it being the blackguard fashion of the English, do you see, to--"

Here I interrupted the jockey.  "You may call it a blackguard fashion," said I, "and I dare
say it is, or it would scarcely be English; but it is an immensely ancient one, and is handed
down to us from our northern ancestry, especially the Danes, who were in the habit of giving
people surnames, or rather nicknames, from some quality of body or mind, but generally from
some disadvantageous peculiarity of feature; for there is no denying that the English, Norse,
or whatever we may please to call them, are an envious, depreciatory set of people, who not
only give their poor comrades contemptuous names, but their great people also.  They didn't
call you the matchless Hurler, because, by doing so, they would have paid you a compliment,
but Hull over the Head Jack, as much as to say that after all you were a scrub; so, in ancient
time, instead of calling Regner the great conqueror, the Nation Tamer, they surnamed him Lodbrog,
which signifies Rough or Hairy Breeks--lod or loddin signifying rough or hairy; and instead
of complimenting Halgerdr, the wife of Gunnar of Hlitharend, the great champion of Iceland,
upon her majestic presence, by calling her Halgerdr, the stately or tall; what must they do
but term her Ha-brokr, or Highbreeks, it being the fashion in old times for Northern ladies
to wear breeks, or breeches, which English ladies of the present day never think of doing;
and just, as of old, they called Halgerdr Long-breeks, so this very day a fellow of Horncastle
called, in my hearing, our noble-looking Hungarian friend here, Long-stockings.  Oh, I could
give you a hundred instances, both ancient and modern, of this unseemly propensity of our illustrious
race, though I will only trouble you with a few more ancient ones; they not only nicknamed
Regner, but his sons also, who were all kings, and distinguished men: one, whose name was Biorn,
they nicknamed Ironsides; another, Sigurd, Snake in the Eye; another, White Sark, or White
Shirt--I wonder they did not call him Dirty Shirt; and Ivarr, another, who was king of Northumberland,
they called Bienlausi, or the Legless, because he was spindle-shanked, had no sap in his bones,
and consequently no children.  He was a great king, it is true, and very wise, nevertheless
his blackguard countrymen, always averse, as their descendants are, to give credit to anybody,
for any valuable quality or possession, must needs lay hold, do you see--"

But before I could say any more, the jockey, having laid down his pipe, rose, and having taken
off his coat, advanced towards me.

CHAPTER XLII

A Short-tempered Person--Gravitation--The Best Endowment--Mary Fulcher--Fair Dealing--Horse-witchery--Darius
and his Groom--The Jockey's Tricks--The Two Characters--The Jockey's Song.

The jockey, having taken off his coat and advanced towards me, as I have stated in the preceding
chapter, exclaimed, in an angry tone, "This is the third time you have interrupted me in my
tale, Mr. Rye; I passed over the two first times with a simple warning, but you will now please
to get up and give me the satisfaction of a man."

"I am really sorry," said I, "if I have given you offence, but you were talking of our English
habits of bestowing nicknames, and I could not refrain from giving a few examples tending to
prove what a very ancient habit it is."

"But you interrupted me," said the jockey, "and put me out of my tale, which you had no right
to do; and as for your examples, how do you know that I wasn't going to give some as old or
older than yourn?  Now stand up, and I'll make an example of you."

"Well," said I, "I confess it was wrong in me to interrupt you, and I ask your pardon."

"That won't do," said the jockey, "asking pardon won't do."

"Oh," said I, getting up, "if asking pardon does not satisfy you, you are a different man from
what I considered you."

But here the Hungarian, also getting up, interposed his tall form and pipe between us, saying
in English, scarcely intelligible, "Let there be no dispute!  As for myself, I am very much
obliged to the young man of Horncastle for his interruption, though he has told me that one
of his dirty townsmen called me 'Long-stocking.'  By Isten! there is more learning in what
he has just said than in all the verdammt English histories of Thor and Tzernebock I ever read."

"I care nothing for his learning," said the jockey.  "I consider myself as good a man as he,
for all his learning; so stand out of the way, Mr. Sixfooteleven, or--"

"I shall do no such thing," said the Hungarian.  "I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself.
You ask a young man to drink champagne with you, you make him dronk, he interrupt you with
very good sense; he ask your pardon, yet you not--"

"Well," said the jockey, "I am satisfied.  I am rather a short-tempered person, but I bear
no malice.  He is, as you say, drinking my wine, and has perhaps taken a drop too much, not
being used to such high liquor; but one doesn't like to be put out of one's tale, more especially
when one was about to moralize, do you see, oneself, and to show off what little learning one
has.  However, I bears no malice.  Here is a hand to each of you; we'll take another glass
each, and think no more about it."

The jockey having shaken both of our hands, and filled our glasses and his own with what champagne
remained in the bottle, put on his coat, sat down, and resumed his pipe and story.

"Where was I?  Oh, roaming about the country with Hopping Ned and Biting Giles.  Those were
happy days, and a merry and prosperous life we led. However, nothing continues under the sun
in the same state in which it begins, and our firm was soon destined to undergo a change. 
We came to a village where there was a very high church steeple, and in a little time my comrades
induced a crowd of people to go and see me display my gift by flinging stones above the heads
of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, who stood at the four corners on the top, carved in stone.
The parson, seeing the crowd, came waddling out of his rectory to see what was going on.  After
I had flung up the stones, letting them fall just where I liked--and one, I remember, fell
on the head of Mark, where I dare say it remains to the present day--the parson, who was one
of the description of people called philosophers, held up his hand, and asked me to let the
next stone I flung up fall upon it.  He wished, do you see, to know with what weight the stone
would fall down, and talked something about gravitation--a word which I could never understand
to the present day, save that it turned out a grave matter to me.  I, like a silly fellow myself,
must needs consent, and, flinging the stone up to a vast height, contrived so that it fell
into the parson's hand, which it cut dreadfully.  The parson flew into a great rage, more particularly
as everybody laughed at him, and, being a magistrate, ordered his clerk, who was likewise constable,
to conduct me to prison as a rogue and vagabond, telling my comrades that if they did not take
themselves off, he would serve them in the same manner.  So Ned hopped off, and Giles ran after
him, without making any gathering, and I was led to Bridewell, my mittimus following at the
end of a week, the parson's hand not permitting him to write before that time.  In the Bridewell
I remained a month, when, being dismissed, I went in quest of my companions, whom, after some
time, I found up, but they refused to keep my company any longer; telling me that I was a dangerous
character, likely to bring them more trouble than profit; they had, moreover, filled up my
place.  Going into a cottage to ask for a drink of water, they saw a country fellow making
faces to amuse his children; the faces were so wonderful that Hopping Ned and Biting Giles
at once proposed taking him into partnership, and the man--who was a fellow not very fond of
work--after a little entreaty, went away with them.  I saw him exhibit his gift, and couldn't
blame the others for preferring him to me; he was a proper ugly fellow at all times, but when
he made faces his countenance was like nothing human.  He was called Ugly Moses.  I was so
amazed at his faces, that though poor myself I gave him sixpence, which I have never grudged
to this day, for I never saw anything like them.  The firm throve wonderfully after he had
been admitted into it.  He died some little time ago, keeper of a public- house, which he had
been enabled to take from the profits of his faces.  A son of his, one of the children he was
making faces to when my comrades entered his door, is at present a barrister, and a very rising
one.  He has his gift--he has not, it is true, the gift of the gab, but he has something better,
he was born with a grin on his face, a quiet grin; he would not have done to grin through a
collar like his father, and would never have been taken up by Hopping Ned and Biting Giles,
but that grin of his caused him to be noticed by a much greater person than either; an attorney
observing it took a liking to the lad, and prophesied that he would some day be heard of in
the world; and in order to give him the first lift, took him into his office, at first to light
fires and do such kind of work, and after a little time taught him to write, then promoted
him to a desk, articled him afterwards, and being unmarried, and without children, left him
what he had when he died.  The young fellow, after practising at the law some time, went to
the bar, where, in a few years, helped on by his grin, for he had nothing else to recommend
him, he became, as I said before, a rising barrister.  He comes our circuit, and I occasionally
employ him, when I am obliged to go to law about such a thing as an unsound horse.  He generally
brings me through--or rather that grin of his does--and yet I don't like the fellow, confound
him, but I'm an oddity--no, the one I like, and whom I generally employ, is a fellow quite
different, a bluff sturdy dog, with no grin on his face, but with a look that seems to say
I am an honest man, and what cares I for any one?  And an honest man he is, and something more.
I have known coves with a better gift of the gab, though not many, but he always speaks to
the purpose, and understands law thoroughly; and that's not all.  When at college, for he has
been at college, he carried off everything before him as a Latiner, and was first-rate at a
game they call matthew mattocks.  I don't exactly know what it is, but I have heard that he
who is first-rate at matthew mattocks is thought more of than if he were first-rate Latiner.

"Well, the chap that I'm talking about, not only came out first-rate Latiner, but first-rate
at matthew mattocks too; doing, in fact, as I am told by those who knows, for I was never at
college myself, what no one had ever done before.  Well, he makes his appearance at our circuit,
does very well, of course, but he has a somewhat high front, as becomes an honest man, and
one who has beat every one at Latin and matthew mattocks; and one who can speak first-rate
law and sense;--but see now, the cove with the grin, who has like myself never been at college;
knows nothing of Latin, or matthew mattocks, and has no particular gift of the gab, has two
briefs for his one, and I suppose very properly, for that grin of his curries favour with the
juries; and mark me, that grin of his will enable him to beat the other in the long run.  We
all know what all barrister coves looks forward to--a seat on the hop sack.  Well, I'll bet
a bull to fivepence, that the grinner gets upon it, and the snarler doesn't; at any rate, that
he gets there first.  I calls my cove--for he is my cove--a snarler; because your first-rates
at matthew mattocks are called snarlers, and for no other reason; for the chap, though with
a high front, is a good chap, and once drank a glass of ale with me, after buying an animal
out of my stable.  I have often thought it a pity he wasn't born with a grin on his face like
the son of Ugly Moses.  It is true he would scarcely then have been an out and outer at Latin
and matthew mattocks, but what need of either to a chap born with a grin? Talk of being born
with a silver spoon in one's mouth! give me a cove born with a grin on his face--a much better
endowment.

"I will now shorten my history as much as I can, for we have talked as much as folks do during
a whole night in the Commons' House, though, of course, not with so much learning, or so much
to the purpose, because--why?  They are in the House of Commons, and we in a public room of
an inn at Horncastle.  The goodness of the ale, do ye see, never depending on what it is made
of, oh, no! but on the fashion and appearance of the jug in which it is served up.  After being
turned out of the firm, I got my living in two or three honest ways, which I shall not trouble
you with describing.  I did not like any of them, however, as they did not exactly suit my
humour; at last I found one which did.  One Saturday afternoon, I chanced to be in the cattle-market
of a place about eighty miles from here; there I won the favour of an old gentleman who sold
dickeys.  He had a very shabby squad of animals, without soul or spirit; nobody would buy them,
till I leaped upon their hinder ends, and by merely wriggling in a particular manner, made
them caper and bound so to people's liking, that in a few hours every one of them was sold
at very sufficient prices.  The old gentleman was so pleased with my skill, that he took me
home with him, and in a very little time into partnership.  It's a good thing to have a gift,
but yet better to have two.  I might have got a very decent livelihood by throwing stones,
but I much question whether I should ever have attained to the position in society which I
now occupy, but for my knowledge of animals.  I lived very comfortably with the old gentleman
till he died, which he did in about a fortnight after he had laid his old lady in the ground.
Having no children, he left me what should remain after he had been buried decently, and the
remainder was six dickeys and thirty shillings in silver.  I remained in the dickey trade ten
years, during which time I saved a hundred pounds.  I then embarked in the horse line.  One
day, being in the--market on a Saturday, I saw Mary Fulcher with a halter round her neck, led
about by a man, who offered to sell her for eighteen- pence.  I took out the money forthwith
and bought her; the man was her husband, a basket-maker, with whom she had lived several years
without having any children; he was a drunken, quarrel-some fellow, and having had a dispute
with her the day before, he determined to get rid of her, by putting a halter round her neck
and leading her to the cattle-market, as if she were a mare, which he had, it seems, a right
to do;--all women being considered mares by old English law, and, indeed, still called mares
in certain counties, where genuine old English is still preserved. That same afternoon, the
man who had been her husband, having got drunk in a public-house, with the money which he had
received for her, quarrelled with another man, and receiving a blow under the ear, fell upon
the floor, and died of artiflex; and in less than three weeks I was married to Mary Fulcher,
by virtue of regular bans.  I am told she was legally my property by virtue of my having bought
her with a halter round her neck; but, to tell you the truth, I think everybody should live
by his trade, and I didn't wish to act shabbily towards our parson, who is a good fellow, and
has certainly a right to his fees.  A better wife than Mary Fulcher--I mean Mary Dale--no one
ever had; she has borne me several children, and has at all times shown a willingness to oblige
me, and to be my faithful wife.  Amongst other things, I begged her to have done with her family,
and I believe she has never spoken to them since.

"I have thriven very well in business, and my name is up as being a person who can be depended
on, when folks treats me handsomely.  I always make a point when a gentleman comes to me, and
says, 'Mr. Dale,' or 'John,' for I have no objection to be called John by a gentleman--'I wants
a good horse, and am ready to pay a good price'--I always makes a point, I say, to furnish
him with an animal worth the money; but when I sees a fellow, whether he calls himself gentleman
or not, wishing to circumvent me, what does I do?  I doesn't quarrel with him; not I; but,
letting him imagine he is taking me in, I contrives to sell him a screw for thirty pounds,
not worth thirty shillings.  All honest respectable people have at present great confidence
in me, and frequently commissions me to buy them horses at great fairs like this.

"This short young gentleman was recommended to me by a great landed proprietor, to whom he
bore letters of recommendation from some great prince in his own country, who had a long time
ago been entertained at the house of the landed proprietor, and the consequence is, that I
brings young six foot six to Horncastle, and purchases for him the horse of the Romany Rye.
I don't do these kind things for nothing, it is true; that can't be expected; for every one
must live by his trade; but, as I said before, when I am treated handsomely, I treat folks
so.  Honesty, I have discovered, as perhaps some other people have, is by far the best policy;
though, as I also said before, when I'm along with thieves, I can beat them at their own game.
If I am obliged to do it, I can pass off the veriest screw as a flying drummedary, for even
when I was a child I had found out by various means what may be done with animals.  I wish
now to ask a civil question, Mr. Romany Rye.  Certain folks have told me that you are a horse
witch; are you one, or are you not?"

"I, like yourself," said I, "know, to a certain extent, what may be done with animals."

"Then how would you, Mr. Romany Rye, pass off the veriest screw in the world for a flying drummedary?"

"By putting a small live eel down his throat; as long as the eel remained in his stomach, the
horse would appear brisk and lively in a surprising degree."

"And how would you contrive to make a regular kicker and biter appear so tame and gentle, that
any respectable fat old gentleman of sixty, who wanted an easy goer, would be glad to purchase
him for fifty pounds?"

"By pouring down his throat four pints of generous old ale, which would make him so happy and
comfortable, that he would not have the heart to kick or bite anybody, for a season at least."

"And where did you learn all this?" said the jockey.

"I have read about the eel in an old English book, and about the making drunk in a Spanish
novel, and, singularly enough, I was told the same things by a wild blacksmith in Ireland.
Now tell me, do you bewitch horses in this way?"

"I?" said the jockey; "mercy upon us!  I wouldn't do such things for a hatful of money.  No,
no, preserve me from live eels and hocussing!  And now let me ask you, how would you spirit
a horse out of a field?"

"How would I spirit a horse out of a field?"

"Yes; supposing you were down in the world, and had determined on taking up the horse-stealing
line of business."

"Why, I should-- But I tell you what, friend, I see you are trying to pump me, and I tell you
plainly that I will hear something from you with respect to your art, before I tell you anything
more.  Now how would you whisper a horse out of a field, provided you were down in the world,
and so forth?"

"Ah, ah, I see you are up to a game, Mr. Romany: however, I am a gentleman in mind, if not
by birth, and I scorn to do the unhandsome thing to anybody who has dealt fairly towards me.
Now you told me something I didn't know, and I'll tell you something which perhaps you do know.
I whispers a horse out of a field in this way: I have a mare in my stable; well, in the early
season of the year I goes into my stable--Well, I puts the sponge into a small bottle which
I keeps corked.  I takes my bottle in my hand, and goes into a field, suppose by night, where
there is a very fine stag horse.  I manage with great difficulty to get within ten yards of
the horse, who stands staring at me just ready to run away. I then uncorks my bottle, presses
my fore-finger to the sponge, and holds it out to the horse, the horse gives a sniff, then
a start, and comes nearer.  I corks up my bottle and puts it into my pocket.  My business is
done, for the next two hours the horse would follow me anywhere--the difficulty, indeed, would
be to get rid of him.  Now is that your way of doing business?"

"My way of doing business?  Mercy upon us!  I wouldn't steal a horse in that way, or, indeed,
in any way, for all the money in the world: however, let me tell you, for your comfort, that
a trick somewhat similar is described in the history of Herodotus."

"In the history of Herod's ass!" said the jockey; "well, if I did write a book, it should be
about something more genteel than a dickey."

"I did not say Herod's ass," said I, "but Herodotus, a very genteel writer, I assure you, who
wrote a history about very genteel people, in a language no less genteel than Greek, more than
two thousand years ago. There was a dispute as to who should be king amongst certain imperious
chieftains.  At last they agreed to obey him whose horse should neigh first on a certain day,
in front of the royal palace, before the rising of the sun; for you must know that they did
not worship the person who made the sun as we do, but the sun itself.  So one of these chieftains,
talking over the matter to his groom, and saying he wondered who would be king, the fellow
said, 'Why you, master, or I don't know much about horses.'  So the day before the day of trial,
what does the groom do, but take his master's horse before the palace and introduce him to
a mare in the stable, and then lead him forth again.  Well, early the next day all the chieftains
on their horses appeared in front of the palace before the dawn of day.  Not a horse neighed
but one, and that was the horse of him who had consulted with his groom, who, thinking of the
animal within the stable, gave such a neigh that all the buildings rang.  His rider was forthwith
elected king, and a brave king he was.  So this shows what seemingly wonderful things may be
brought about by a little preparation."

"It doth," said the jockey; "what was the chap's name?"

"His name--his name--Darius Hystaspes."

"And the groom's?"

"I don't know."

"And he made a good king?"

"First-rate."

"Only think! well, if he made a good king, what a wonderful king the groom would have made,
through whose knowledge of 'orses he was put on the throne.  And now another question, Mr.
Romany Rye, have you particular words which have power to soothe or aggravate horses?"

"You should ask me," said I, "whether I have horses that can be aggravated or soothed by particular
words.  No words have any particular power over horses or other animals who have never heard
them before--how, should they?  But certain animals connect ideas of misery or enjoyment with
particular words which they are acquainted with.  I'll give you an example.  I knew a cob in
Ireland that could be driven to a state of kicking madness by a particular word, used by a
particular person, in a particular tone; but that word was connected with a very painful operation
which had been performed upon him by that individual, who had frequently employed it at a certain
period whilst the animal had been under his treatment.  The same cob could be soothed in a
moment by another word, used by the same individual in a very different kind of tone; the word
was deaghblasda, or sweet tasted.  Some time after the operation, whilst the cob was yet under
his hands, the fellow--who was what the Irish call a fairy smith--had done all he could to
soothe the creature, and had at last succeeded by giving it gingerbread-buttons, of which the
cob became passionately fond.  Invariably, however, before giving it a button, he said, 'Deaghblasda,'
with which word the cob by degrees associated an idea of unmixed enjoyment: so if he could
rouse the cob to madness by the word which recalled the torture to its remembrance, he could
as easily soothe it by the other word, which the cob knew would be instantly followed by the
button, which the smith never failed to give him after using the word deaghblasda."

"There is nothing wonderful to be done," said the jockey, "without a good deal of preparation,
as I know myself.  Folks stare and wonder at certain things which they would only laugh at
if they knew how they were done; and to prove what I say is true, I will give you one or two
examples.  Can either of you lend me a handkerchief?  That won't do," said he, as I presented
him with a silk one.  "I wish for a delicate white handkerchief.  That's just the kind of thing,"
said he, as the Hungarian offered him a fine white cambric handkerchief, beautifully worked
with gold at the hems; "now you shall see me set this handkerchief on fire." "Don't let him
do so by any means," said the Hungarian, speaking to me in German, "it is the gift of a lady
whom I highly admire, and I would not have it burnt for the world."  "He has no occasion to
be under any apprehension," said the jockey, after I had interpreted to him what the Hungarian
had said, "I will restore it to him uninjured, or my name is not Jack Dale."  Then sticking
the handkerchief carelessly into the left side of his bosom, he took the candle, which by this
time had burnt very low, and holding his head back, he applied the flame to the handkerchief,
which instantly seemed to catch fire.  "What do you think of that?" said he to the Hungarian.
"Why, that you have ruined me," said the latter. "No harm done, I assure you," said the jockey,
who presently, clapping his hand on his bosom, extinguished the fire, and returned the handkerchief
to the Hungarian, asking him if it was burnt.  "I see no burn upon it," said the Hungarian;
"but in the name of Gott, how could you set it on fire without burning it?"  "I never set it
on fire at all," said the jockey; "I set this on fire," showing us a piece of half-burnt calico.
"I placed this calico above it, and lighted not the handkerchief, but the rag.  Now I will
show you something else.  I have a magic shilling in my pocket, which I can make run up along
my arm.  But, first of all, I would gladly know whether either of you can do the like." Thereupon
the Hungarian and myself, putting our hands into our pockets, took out shillings, and endeavoured
to make them run up our arms, but utterly failed; both shillings, after we had made two or
three attempts, falling to the ground.  "What noncomposses you both are," said the jockey;
and placing a shilling on the end of the fingers of his right hand he made strange faces to
it, drawing back his head, whereupon the shilling instantly began to run up his arm, occasionally
hopping and jumping as if it were bewitched, always endeavouring to make towards the head of
the jockey.

"How do I do that?" said he, addressing himself to me.  "I really do not know," said I, "unless
it is by the motion of your arm."  "The motion of my nonsense," said the jockey, and, making
a dreadful grimace, the shilling hopped upon his knee, and began to run up his thigh and to
climb up his breast.  "How is that done?" said he again.  "By witchcraft, I suppose," said
I.  "There you are right," said the jockey; "by the witchcraft of one of Miss Berners' hairs;
the end of one of her long hairs is tied to that shilling by means of a hole in it, and the
other end goes round my neck by means of a loop; so that, when I draw back my head, the shilling
follows it.  I suppose you wish to know how I got the hair," said he, grinning at me.  "I will
tell you.  I once, in the course of my ridings, saw Miss Berners beneath a hedge, combing out
her long hair, and, being rather a modest kind of person, what must I do but get off my horse,
tie him to a gate, go up to her, and endeavour to enter into conversation with her.  After
giving her the sele of the day, and complimenting her on her hair, I asked her to give me one
of the threads; whereupon she gave me such a look, and, calling me fellow, told me to take
myself off.  'I must have a hair first,' said I, making a snatch at one.  I believe I hurt
her; but, whether I did or not, up she started, and, though her hair was unbound, gave me the
only drubbing I ever had in my life.  And now, Mr. Romany Rye, to testify my regard for you,
I give you the shilling and the hair.  I think you have a kind of respect for Miss Berners;
but whether you have or not, keep them as long as you can, and whenever you look at them think
of the finest woman in England, and of John Dale, the jockey of Horncastle.  I believe I have
told you my history," said he--"no, not quite; there is one circumstance I had passed over.
I told you that I have thriven very well in business, and so I have, upon the whole; at any
rate, I find myself comfortably off now.  I have horses, money, and owe nobody a groat; at
any rate, nothing but what I could pay to-morrow.  Yet I have had my dreary day, ay, after
I had obtained what I call a station in the world.  All of a sudden, about five years ago,
everything seemed to go wrong with me--horses became sick or died, people who owed me money
broke or ran away, my house caught fire, in fact, everything went against me; and not from
any mismanagement of my own.  I looked round for help, but--what do you think?--nobody would
help me.  Somehow or other it had got abroad that I was in difficulties, and everybody seemed
disposed to avoid me, as if I had got the plague.  Those who were always offering me help when
I wanted none, now, when they thought me in trouble, talked of arresting me.  Yes; two particular
friends of mine, who had always been offering me their purses when my own was stuffed full,
now talked of arresting me, though I only owed the scoundrels a hundred pounds each; and they
would have done so, provided I had not paid them what I owed them; and how did I do that? 
Why, I was able to do it because I found a friend--and who was that friend?  Why, a man who
has since been hung, of whom everybody has heard, and of whom everybody for the next hundred
years will occasionally talk.

"One day, whilst in trouble, I was visited by a person I had occasionally met at sporting-dinners.
He came to look after a Suffolk Punch, the best horse, by the bye, that anybody can purchase
to drive, it being the only animal of the horse kind in England that will pull twice at a dead
weight.  I told him that I had none at that time that I could recommend; in fact, that every
horse in my stable was sick.  He then invited me to dine with him at an inn close by, and I
was glad to go with him, in the hope of getting rid of unpleasant thoughts.  After dinner,
during which he talked nothing but slang, observing I looked very melancholy, he asked me what
was the matter with me, and I, my heart being opened by the wine he had made me drink, told
him my circumstances without reserve.  With an oath or two for not having treated him at first
like a friend, he said he would soon set me all right; and pulling out two hundred pounds,
told me to pay him when I could.  I felt as I never felt before; however, I took his notes,
paid my sneaks, and in less than three months was right again, and had returned him his money.
On paying it to him, I said that I had now a Punch which would just suit him, saying that I
would give it to him--a free gift--for nothing.  He swore at me;--telling me to keep my Punch,
for that he was suited already.  I begged him to tell me how I could requite him for his kindness,
whereupon, with the most dreadful oath I ever heard, he bade me come and see him hanged when
his time was come.  I wrung his hand, and told him I would, and I kept my word.  The night
before the day he was hanged at H---, I harnessed a Suffolk Punch to my light gig, the same
Punch which I had offered to him, which I have ever since kept, and which brought me and this
short young man to Horncastle, and in eleven hours I drove that Punch one hundred and ten miles.
I arrived at H--- just in the nick of time.  There was the ugly jail--the scaffold--and there
upon it stood the only friend I ever had in the world.  Driving my Punch, which was all in
a foam, into the midst of the crowd, which made way for me as if it knew what I came for, I
stood up in my gig, took off my hat, and shouted, 'God Almighty bless you, Jack!'  The dying
man turned his pale grim face towards me--for his face was always somewhat grim, do you see--nodded
and said, or I thought I heard him say, 'All right, old chap.'  The next moment--my eyes water.
He had a high heart, got into a scrape whilst in the marines, lost his half- pay, took to the
turf, ring, gambling, and at last cut the throat of a villain who had robbed him of nearly
all he had.  But he had good qualities, and I know for certain that he never did half the bad
things laid to his charge; for example, he never bribed Tom Oliver to fight cross, as it was
said he did on the day of the awful thunder-storm.  Ned Flatnose fairly beat Tom Oliver, for
though Ned was not what's called a good fighter, he had a particular blow, which if he could
put in he was sure to win.  His right shoulder, do you see, was two inches farther back than
it ought to have been, and consequently his right fist generally fell short; but if he could
swing himself round, and put in a blow with that right arm, he could kill or take away the
senses of anybody in the world.  It was by putting in that blow in his second fight with Spring
that he beat noble Tom.  Spring beat him like a sack in the first battle, but in the second
Ned Painter--for that was his real name--contrived to put in his blow, and took the senses
out of Spring; and in like manner he took the senses out of Tom Oliver.

"Well, some are born to be hanged, and some are not; and many of those who are not hanged are
much worse than those who are.  Jack, with many a good quality, is hanged, whilst that fellow
of a lord, who wanted to get the horse from you at about two-thirds of his value, without a
single good quality in the world, is not hanged, and probably will remain so. You ask the reason
why, perhaps.  I'll tell you; the lack of a certain quality called courage, which Jack possessed
in abundance, will preserve him; from the love which he bears his own neck he will do nothing
which can bring him to the gallows.  In my rough way I'll draw their characters from their
childhood, and then ask whether Jack was not the best character of the two.  Jack was a rough,
audacious boy, fond of fighting, going a birds'-nesting, but I never heard he did anything
particularly cruel save once, I believe, tying a canister to a butcher's dog's tail; whilst
this fellow of a lord was by nature a savage beast, and when a boy would in winter pluck poor
fowls naked, and set them running on the ice and in the snow, and was particularly fond of
burning cats alive in the fire.  Jack, when a lad, gets a commission on board a ship as an
officer of horse marines, and in two or three engagements behaves quite up to the mark--at
least of a marine; the marines having no particular character for courage, you know--never
having run to the guns and fired them like madmen after the blue jackets had had more than
enough.  Oh, dear me, no! My lord gets into the valorous British army, where cowardice--Oh,
dear me!--is a thing almost entirely unknown; and being on the field of Waterloo the day before
the battle, falls off his horse, and, pretending to be hurt in the back, gets himself put on
the sick list--a pretty excuse--hurting his back--for not being present at such a fight.  Old
Benbow, after part of both his legs had been shot away in a sea-fight, made the carpenter make
him a cradle to hold his bloody stumps, and continued on deck, cheering his men till he died.
Jack returns home, and gets into trouble, and having nothing to subsist by but his wits, gets
his living by the ring and the turf, doing many an odd kind of thing, I dare say, but not half
those laid to his charge.  My lord does much the same without the excuse for doing so which
Jack had, for he had plenty of means, is a leg, and a black, only in a more polished way, and
with more cunning, and I may say success, having done many a rascally thing never laid to his
charge.  Jack at last cuts the throat of a villain who had cheated him of all he had in the
world, and who, I am told, was in many points the counterpart of this screw and white feather,
is taken up, tried, and executed; and certainly taking away a man's life is a dreadful thing;
but is there nothing as bad?  Whitefeather will cut no person's throat--I will not say who
has cheated him, for, being a cheat himself, he will take good care that nobody cheats him,
but he'll do something quite as bad; out of envy to a person who never injured him, and whom
he hates for being more clever and respected than himself, he will do all he possibly can,
by backbiting and every unfair means, to do that person a mortal injury.  But Jack is hanged,
and my lord it not.  Is that right? My wife, Mary Fulcher--I beg her pardon, Mary Dale--who
is a Methodist, and has heard the mighty preacher, Peter Williams, says some people are preserved
from hanging by the grace of God.  With her I differs, and says it is from want of courage.
This Whitefeather, with one particle of Jack's courage, and with one tithe of his good qualities,
would have been hanged long ago, for he has ten times Jack's malignity.  Jack was hanged because,
along with his bad qualities, he had courage and generosity; this fellow is not, because with
all Jack's bad qualities, and many more, amongst which is cunning, he has neither courage nor
generosity.  Think of a fellow like that putting down two hundred pounds to relieve a distressed
fellow-creature; why he would rob, but for the law and the fear it fills him with, a workhouse
child of its breakfast, as the saying is--and has been heard to say that he would not trust
his own father for sixpence, and he can't imagine why such a thing as credit should be ever
given.  I never heard a person give him a good word--stay, stay, yes!  I once heard an old
parson, to whom I sold a Punch, say that he had the art of receiving company gracefully and
dismissing them without refreshment. I don't wish to be too hard with him, and so let him make
the most of that compliment.  Well! he manages to get on, whilst Jack is hanged; not quite
enviably, however; he has had his rubs, and pretty hard ones--everybody knows he slunk from
Waterloo, and occasionally checks him with so doing; whilst he has been rejected by a woman--what
a mortification to the low pride of which the scoundrel has plenty!  There's a song about both
circumstances, which may, perhaps, ring in his ears on a dying bed.  It's a funny kind of song,
set to the old tune of the Lord- Lieutenant or Deputy, and with it I will conclude my discourse,
for I really think it's past one."  The jockey then, with a very tolerable voice, sung the
following song:--

THE JOCKEY'S SONG.

   Now list to a ditty both funny and true!--
      Merrily moves the dance along--
   A ditty that tells of a coward and screw,
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   Sir Plume, though not liking a bullet at all,--
      Merrily moves the dance along--
   Had yet resolution to go to a ball,
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   "Woulez wous danser, mademoiselle?"--
      Merrily moves the dance along;--
   Said she, "Sir, to dance I should like very well,"
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   They danc'd to the left, and they danc'd to the right,--
      Merrily moves the dance along;--
   And her troth the fair damsel bestow'd on the knight,
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   "Now what shall I fetch you, mademoiselle?"--
      Merrily moves the dance along;--
   Said she, "Sir, an ice I should like very well,"
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   But the ice, when he'd got it, he instantly ate,--
      Merrily moves the dance along;--
   Although his poor partner was all in a fret,
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   He ate up the ice like a prudent young lord,--
      Merrily moves the dance along;--
   For he saw 't was the very last ice on the board,--
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   "Now, when shall we marry?" the gentleman cried;--
      Merrily moves the dance along;--
   "Sir, get you to Jordan," the damsel replied,
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   "I never will wed with the pitiful elf"--
      Merrily moves the dance along--
   "Who ate up the ice which I wanted myself,"
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

   "I'd pardon your backing from red Waterloo,"--
      Merrily moves the dance along--
   "But I never will wed with a coward and screw,"
      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.

CHAPTER XLIII

The Church.

The next morning I began to think of departing; I had sewed up the money which I had received
for the horse in a portion of my clothing, where I entertained no fears for its safety, with
the exception of a small sum in notes, gold, and silver, which I carried in my pocket.  Ere
departing, however, I determined to stroll about and examine the town, and observe more particularly
the humours of the fair than I had hitherto an opportunity of doing.  The town, when I examined
it, offered no object worthy of attention but its church--an edifice of some antiquity; under
the guidance of an old man, who officiated as sexton, I inspected its interior attentively,
occasionally conversing with my guide, who, however, seemed much more disposed to talk about
horses than the church. "No good horses in the fair this time, measter," said he; "none but
one brought hither by a chap whom nobody knows, and bought by a foreigneering man, who came
here with Jack Dale.  The horse fetched a good swinging price, which is said, however, to be
much less than its worth; for the horse is a regular clipper; not such a one, 'tis said, has
been seen in the fair for several summers.  Lord Whitefeather says that he believes the fellow
who brought him to be a highwayman, and talks of having him taken up, but Lord Whitefeather
is only in a rage because he could not get him for himself.  The chap would not sell it to
un; Lord Screw wanted to beat him down, and the chap took huff, said he wouldn't sell it to
him at no price, and accepted the offer of the foreigneering man, or of Jack, who was his 'terpreter,
and who scorned to higgle about such a hanimal, because Jack is a gentleman, though bred a
dickey-boy, whilst t'other, though bred a lord, is a screw and a whitefeather.  Every one says
the cove was right, and I says so too; I likes spirit, and if the cove were here, and in your
place, measter, I would invite him to drink a pint of beer.  Good horses are scarce now, measter,
ay, and so are good men, quite a different set from what there were when I was young; that
was the time for men and horses.  Lord bless you, I know all the breeders about here; they
are not a bad set, and they breed a very fairish set of horses, but they are not like what
their fathers were, nor are their horses like their fathers' horses.  Now there is Mr. ---
the great breeder, a very fairish man, with very fairish horses; but, Lord bless you, he's
nothing to what his father was, nor his steeds to his father's; I ought to know, for I was
at the school here with his father, and afterwards for many a year helped him to get up his
horses; that was when I was young, measter--those were the days.  You look at that monument,
measter," said he, as I stopped and looked attentively at a monument on the southern side of
the church near the altar; "that was put up for a rector of this church, who lived a long time
ago, in Oliver's time, and was ill-treated and imprisoned by Oliver and his men; you will see
all about it on the monument.  There was a grand battle fought nigh this place, between Oliver's
men and the Royal party, and the Royal party had the worst of it, as I'm told they generally
had; and Oliver's men came into the town, and did a great deal of damage, and ill-treated the
people.  I can't remember anything about the matter myself, for it happened just one hundred
years before I was born, but my father was acquainted with an old countryman, who lived not
many miles from here, who said he remembered perfectly well the day of the battle; that he
was a boy at the time, and was working in a field near the place where the battle was fought;
and heard shouting, and noise of firearms, and also the sound of several balls, which fell
in the field near him.  Come this way, measter, and I will show you some remains of that day's
field." Leaving the monument, on which was inscribed an account of the life and sufferings
of the Royalist Rector of Horncastle, I followed the sexton to the western end of the church,
where, hanging against the wall, were a number of scythes stuck in the ends of poles.  "Those
are the weapons, measter," said the sexton, "which the great people put into the hands of the
country folks, in order that they might use them against Oliver's men; ugly weapons enough;
however, Oliver's men won, and Sir Jacob Ashley and his party were beat.  And a rare time Oliver
and his men had of it, till Oliver died, when the other party got the better, not by fighting,
'tis said, but through a General Monk, who turned sides.  Ah, the old fellow that my father
knew, said he well remembered the time when General Monk went over and proclaimed Charles the
Second.  Bonfires were lighted everywhere, oxen roasted, and beer drunk by pailfuls; the country
folks were drunk with joy, and something else; sung scurvy songs about Oliver to the tune of
Barney Banks, and pelted his men, wherever they found them, with stones and dirt."  "The more
ungrateful scoundrels they," said I.  "Oliver and his men fought the battle of English independence
against a wretched king and corrupt lords.  Had I been living at the time, I should have been
proud to be a trooper of Oliver."  "You would, measter, would you?  Well, I never quarrels
with the opinions of people who come to look at the church, and certainly independence is a
fine thing.  I like to see a chap of an independent spirit, and if I were now to see the cove
that refused to sell his horse to my Lord Screw and Whitefeather, and let Jack Dale have him,
I would offer to treat him to a pint of beer--e'es, I would, verily.  Well, measter, you have
now seen the church, and all there's in it worth seeing--so I'll just lock up, and go and finish
digging the grave I was about when you came, after which I must go into the fair to see how
matters are going on.  Thank ye, measter," said he, as I put something into his hand; "thank
ye kindly; 'tis not every one who gives me a shilling now-a-days who comes to see the church,
but times are very different from what they were when I was young; I was not sexton then, but
something better; helped Mr. --- with his horses, and got many a broad crown.  Those were the
days, measter, both for men and horses--and I say, measter, if men and horses were so much
better when I was young than they are now, what, I wonder, must they have been in the time
of Oliver and his men?"

CHAPTER XLIV

An Old Acquaintance.

Leaving the church, I strolled through the fair, looking at the horses, listening to the chaffering
of the buyers and sellers, and occasionally putting in a word of my own, which was not always
received with much deference; suddenly, however, on a whisper arising that I was the young
cove who had brought the wonderful horse to the fair which Jack Dale had bought for the foreigneering
man, I found myself an object of the greatest attention; those who had before replied with
stuff! and nonsense! to what I said, now listened with the greatest eagerness to any nonsense
I wished to utter, and I did not fail to utter a great deal; presently, however, becoming disgusted
with the beings about me, I forced my way, not very civilly, through my crowd of admirers;
and passing through an alley and a back street, at last reached an outskirt of the fair, where
no person appeared to know me.  Here I stood, looking vacantly on what was going on, musing
on the strange infatuation of my species, who judge of a person's words, not from their intrinsic
merit, but from the opinion--generally an erroneous one--which they have formed of the person.
From this reverie I was roused by certain words which sounded near me, uttered in a strange
tone, and in a strange cadence--the words were, "them that finds, wins; and them that can't
find, loses." Turning my eyes in the direction from which the words proceeded, I saw six or
seven people, apparently all countrymen, gathered round a person standing behind a tall white
table of very small compass.  "What!" said I, "the thimble-engro of --- Fair here at Horncastle."
Advancing nearer, however, I perceived that though the present person was a thimble-engro,
he was a very different one from my old acquaintance of --- Fair.  The present one was a fellow
about half-a-foot taller than the other.  He had a long, haggard, wild face, and was dressed
in a kind of jacket, something like that of a soldier, with dirty hempen trousers, and with
a foreign-looking peaked hat on his head.  He spoke with an accent evidently Irish, and occasionally
changed the usual thimble formule, "them that finds wins, and them that can't--och, sure!--they
loses;" saying also frequently, "your honour," instead of "my lord."  I observed, on drawing
nearer, that he handled the pea and thimble with some awkwardness, like that which might be
expected from a novice in the trade.  He contrived, however, to win several shillings, for
he did not seem to play for gold, from "their honours."  Awkward, as he was, he evidently did
his best, and never flung a chance away by permitting any one to win.  He had just won three
shillings from a farmer, who, incensed at his loss, was calling him a confounded cheat, and
saying that he would play no more, when up came my friend of the preceding day, Jack, the jockey.
This worthy, after looking at the thimble-man a moment or two, with a peculiarly crafty glance,
cried out, as he clapped down a shilling on the table, "I will stand you, old fellow!"  "Them
that finds wins; and them that can't--och, sure!--they loses," said the thimble-man.  The game
commenced, and Jack took up the thimble without finding the pea; another shilling was produced,
and lost in the same manner; "this is slow work," said Jack, banging down a guinea on the table;
"can you cover that, old fellow?"  The man of the thimble looked at the gold, and then at him
who produced it, and scratched his head.  "Come, cover that, or I shall be off," said the jockey.
"Och, sure, my lord!--no, I mean your honour--no, sure, your lordship," said the other, "if
I covers it at all, it must be with silver, for divil a bit of gold have I by me."  "Well,
then, produce the value in silver," said the jockey, "and do it quickly, for I can't be staying
here all day."  The thimble-man hesitated, looked at Jack with a dubious look, then at the
gold, and then scratched his head.  There was now a laugh amongst the surrounders, which evidently
nettled the fellow, who forthwith thrust his hand into his pocket, and pulling out all his
silver treasure, just contrived to place the value of the guinea on the table.  "Them that
finds wins, and them that can't find--loses," interrupted Jack, lifting up a thimble, out of
which rolled a pea. "There, paddy, what do you think of that?" said he, seizing the heap of
silver with one hand, whilst he pocketed the guinea with the other.  The thimble-engro stood,
for some time, like one transfixed, his eyes glaring wildly, now at the table, and now at his
successful customers; at last he said, "Arrah, sure, master!--no, I manes my lord--you are
not going to ruin a poor boy!"  "Ruin you!" said the other; "what! by winning a guinea's change?
a pretty small dodger you--if you have not sufficient capital, why do you engage in so deep
a trade as thimbling? come, will you stand another game?"  "Och, sure, master, no! the twenty
shillings and one which you have cheated me of were all I had in the world." "Cheated you,"
said Jack, "say that again, and I will knock you down." "Arrah! sure, master, you knows that
the pea under the thimble was not mine; here is mine, master; now give me back my money." 
"A likely thing," said Jack; "no, no, I know a trick worth two or three of that; whether the
pea was yours or mine, you will never have your twenty shillings and one again; and if I have
ruined you, all the better; I'd gladly ruin all such villains as you, who ruin poor men with
your dirty tricks, whom you would knock down and rob on the road, if you had but courage; not
that I mean to keep your shillings, with the exception of the two you cheated from me, which
I'll keep.  A scramble, boys! a scramble!" said he, flinging up all the silver into the air,
with the exception of the two shillings; and a scramble there instantly was, between the rustics
who had lost their money and the urchins who came running up; the poor thimble-engro tried
likewise to have his share; and though he flung himself down, in order to join more effectually
in the scramble, he was unable to obtain a single sixpence; and having in his rage given some
of his fellow-scramblers a cuff or two, he was set upon by the boys and country fellows, and
compelled to make an inglorious retreat with his table, which had been flung down in the scuffle,
and had one of its legs broken.  As he retired, the rabble hooted, and Jack, holding up in
derision the pea with which he had outmanoeuvred him, exclaimed, "I always carry this in my
pocket in order to be a match for vagabonds like you."

The tumult over, Jack gone, and the rabble dispersed, I followed the discomfited adventurer
at a distance, who, leaving the town, went slowly on, carrying his dilapidated piece of furniture;
till coming to an old wall by the roadside, he placed it on the ground, and sat down, seemingly
in deep despondency, holding his thumb to his mouth.  Going nearly up to him, I stood still,
whereupon he looked up, and perceiving I was looking steadfastly at him, he said, in an angry
tone, "Arrah! what for are you staring at me so?  By my shoul, I think you are one of the thaives
who are after robbing me.  I think I saw you among them, and if I were only sure of it, I would
take the liberty of trying to give you a big bating." "You have had enough of trying to give
people a beating," said I; "you had better be taking your table to some skilful carpenter to
get it repaired.  He will do it for sixpence."  "Divil a sixpence did you and your thaives
leave me," said he; "and if you do not take yourself off, joy, I will be breaking your ugly
head with the foot of it."  "Arrah, Murtagh!" said I, "would ye be breaking the head of your
friend and scholar, to whom you taught the blessed tongue of Oilien nan Naomha, in exchange
for a pack of cards?"  Murtagh, for he it was, gazed at me for a moment with a bewildered look;
then, with a gleam of intelligence in his eye, he said, "Shorsha! no, it can't be--yes, by
my faith it is!"  Then, springing up, and seizing me by the hand, he said, "Yes, by the powers,
sure enough it is Shorsha agra!  Arrah, Shorsha! where have you been this many a day?  Sure,
you are not one of the spalpeens who are after robbing me?"  "Not I," I replied, "but I saw
all that happened.  Come, you must not take matters so to heart; cheer up; such things will
happen in connection with the trade you have taken up."  "Sorrow befall the trade, and the
thief who taught it me," said Murtagh; "and yet the trade is not a bad one, if I only knew
more of it, and had some one to help and back me.  Och! the idea of being cheated and bamboozled
by that one-eyed thief in the horseman's dress."  "Let bygones be bygones, Murtagh," said I;
"it is no use grieving for the past; sit down, and let us have a little pleasant gossip.  Arrah,
Murtagh! when I saw you sitting under the wall, with your thumb to your mouth, it brought to
my mind tales which you used to tell me all about Finn-ma-Coul.  You have not forgotten Finn-ma-Coul,
Murtagh, and how he sucked wisdom out of his thumb."  "Sorrow a bit have I forgot about him,
Shorsha," said Murtagh, as we sat down together, "nor what you yourself told me about the snake.
Arrah, Shorsha! what ye told me about the snake, bates anything I ever told you about Finn.
Ochone, Shorsha! perhaps you will be telling me about the snake once more?  I think the tale
would do me good, and I have need of comfort, God knows, ochone!"  Seeing Murtagh in such a
distressed plight, I forthwith told him over again the tale of the snake, in precisely the
same words as I have related it in the first part of this history.  After which, I said, "Now,
Murtagh, tit for tat; ye will be telling me one of the old stories of Finn-ma-Coul."  "Och,
Shorsha!  I haven't heart enough," said Murtagh. "Thank you for your tale, but it makes me
weep; it brings to my mind Dungarvon times of old--I mean the times we were at school together."
"Cheer up, man," said I, "and let's have the story, and let it be about Ma-Coul and the salmon
and his thumb."  "Arrah, Shorsha!  I can't.  Well, to oblige you, I'll give it you.  Well,
you know Ma-Coul was an exposed child, and came floating over the salt sea in a chest which
was cast ashore at Veintry Bay.  In the corner of that bay was a castle, where dwelt a giant
and his wife, very respectable and decent people, and this giant, taking his morning walk along
the bay, came to the place where the child had been cast ashore in his box.  Well, the giant
looked at the child, and being filled with compassion for his exposed state, took the child
up in his box, and carried him home to his castle, where he and his wife, being dacent respectable
people, as I telled ye before, fostered the child and took care of him, till he became old
enough to go out to service and gain his livelihood, when they bound him out apprentice to
another giant, who lived in a castle up the country, at some distance from the bay.

"This giant, whose name was Darmod David Odeen, was not a respectable person at all, but a
big old vagabond.  He was twice the size of the other giant, who, though bigger than any man,
was not a big giant; for, as there are great and small men, so there are great and small giants--I
mean some are small when compared with the others.  Well, Finn served this giant a considerable
time, doing all kinds of hard and unreasonable service for him, and receiving all kinds of
hard words, and many a hard knock and kick to boot--sorrow befall the old vagabond who could
thus ill- treat a helpless foundling.  It chanced that one day the giant caught a salmon, near
a salmon-leap upon his estate--for, though a big ould blackguard, he was a person of considerable
landed property, and high sheriff for the county Cork.  Well, the giant brings home the salmon
by the gills, and delivers it to Finn, telling him to roast it for the giant's dinner; 'but
take care, ye young blackguard,' he added, 'that in roasting it--and I expect ye to roast it
well--you do not let a blister come upon its nice satin skin, for if ye do, I will cut the
head off your shoulders.'  'Well,' thinks Finn, 'this is a hard task; however, as I have done
many hard tasks for him, I will try and do this too, though I was never set to do anything
yet half so difficult.'  So he prepared his fire, and put his gridiron upon it, and lays the
salmon fairly and softly upon the gridiron, and then he roasts it, turning it from one side
to the other just in the nick of time, before the soft satin skin could be blistered.  However,
on turning it over the eleventh time--and twelve would have settled the business--he found
he had delayed a little bit of time too long in turning it over, and that there was a small,
tiny blister on the soft outer skin.  Well, Finn was in a mighty panic, remembering the threats
of the ould giant; however, he did not lose heart, but clapped his thumb upon the blister in
order to smooth it down. Now the salmon, Shorsha, was nearly done, and the flesh thoroughly
hot, so Finn's thumb was scalt, and he, clapping it to his mouth, sucked it, in order to draw
out the pain, and in a moment--hubbuboo!--became imbued with all the wisdom of the world.

Myself.  Stop, Murtagh! stop!

Murtagh.  All the witchcraft, Shorsha.

Myself.  How wonderful!

Murtagh.  Was it not, Shorsha?  The salmon, do you see, was a fairy salmon.

Myself.  What a strange coincidence!

Murtagh.  A what, Shorsha?

Myself.  Why, that the very same tale should be told of Finn-ma-Coul, which is related of Sigurd
Fafnisbane.

"What thief was that, Shorsha?"

"Thief!  'Tis true, he took the treasure of Fafnir.  Sigurd was the hero of the North, Murtagh,
even as Finn is the great hero of Ireland.  He, too, according to one account, was an exposed
child, and came floating in a casket to a wild shore, where he was suckled by a hind, and afterwards
found and fostered by Mimir, a fairy blacksmith; he, too, sucked wisdom from a burn.  According
to the Edda, he burnt his finger whilst feeling of the heart of Fafnir, which he was roasting,
and putting it into his mouth in order to suck out the pain, became imbued with all the wisdom
of the world, the knowledge of the language of birds, and what not.  I have heard you tell
the tale of Finn a dozen times in the blessed days of old, but its identity with the tale of
Sigurd never occurred to me till now. It is true, when I knew you of old, I had never read
the tale of Sigurd, and have since almost dismissed matters of Ireland from my mind; but as
soon as you told me again about Finn's burning his finger, the coincidence struck me.  I say,
Murtagh, the Irish owe much to the Danes--"

"Devil a bit, Shorsha, do they owe to the thaives, except many a bloody bating and plundering,
which they never paid them back.  Och, Shorsha! you, edicated in ould Ireland, to say that
the Irish owes anything good to the plundering villains--the Siol Loughlin."

"They owe them half their traditions, Murtagh, and amongst others, Finn- ma-Coul and the burnt
finger; and if ever I publish the Loughlin songs, I'll tell the world so."

"But, Shorsha, the world will never believe ye--to say nothing of the Irish part of it."

"Then the world, Murtagh--to say nothing of the Irish part of it--will be a fool, even as I
have often thought it; the grand thing, Murtagh, is to be able to believe oneself, and respect
oneself.  How few whom the world believes believe and respect themselves."

"Och, Shorsha! shall I go on with the tale of Finn?"

"I'd rather you should not, Murtagh; I know all about it already."

"Then why did you bother me to tell it at first, Shorsha?  Och, it was doing my ownself good,
and making me forget my own sorrowful state, when ye interrupted me with your thaives of Danes!
Och, Shorsha! let me tell you how Finn, by means of sucking his thumb, and the witchcraft he
imbibed from it, contrived to pull off the arm of the ould wagabone, Darmod David Odeen, whilst
shaking hands with him--for Finn could do no feat of strength without sucking his thumb, Shorsha,
as Conan the Bald told the son of Oisin in the song which I used to sing ye in Dungarvon times
of old;" and here Murtagh repeated certain Irish words to the following effect:--

   "O little the foolish words I heed
   O Oisin's son, from thy lips which come;
   No strength were in Finn for valorous deed,
   Unless to the gristle he suck'd his thumb."

"Enough is as good as a feast, Murtagh, I am no longer in the cue for Finn.  I would rather
hear your own history.  Now tell us, man, all that has happened to ye since Dungarvon times
of old?"

"Och, Shorsha, it would be merely bringing all my sorrows back upon me!"

"Well, if I know all your sorrows, perhaps I shall be able to find a help for them.  I owe
you much, Murtagh; you taught me Irish, and I will do all I can to help you."

"Why, then, Shorsha, I'll tell ye my history.  Here goes!"

CHAPTER XLV

Murtagh's Tale.

"Well, Shorsha, about a year and a half after you left us--and a sorrowful hour for us it was
when ye left us, losing, as we did, your funny stories of your snake--and the battles of your
military--they sent me to Paris and Salamanca, in order to make a saggart of me."

"Pray excuse me," said I, "for interrupting you, but what kind of place is Salamanca?"

"Divil a bit did I ever see of it, Shorsha!"

"Then why did ye say ye were sent there?  Well, what kind of place is Paris?  Not that I care
much about Paris."

"Sorrow a bit did I ever see of either them, Shorsha, for no one sent me to either.  When we
says at home a person is going to Paris and Salamanca, it manes that he is going abroad to
study to be a saggart, whether he goes to them places or not.  No, I never saw either--bad
luck to them--I was shipped away from Cork up the straits to a place called Leghorn, from which
I was sent to--to a religious house, where I was to be instructed in saggarting till they had
made me fit to cut a dacent figure in Ireland.  We had a long and tedious voyage, Shorsha;
not so tedious, however, as it would have been had I been fool enough to lave your pack of
cards behind me, as the thaif, my brother Denis, wanted to persuade me to do, in order that
he might play with them himself.  With the cards I managed to have many a nice game with the
sailors, winning from them ha'pennies and sixpences until the captain said I was ruining his
men, and keeping them from their duty; and, being a heretic and a Dutchman, swore that unless
I gave over he would tie me up to the mast and give me a round dozen.  This threat obliged
me to be more on my guard, though I occasionally contrived to get a game at night, and to win
sixpennies and ha'pennies.

"We reached Leghorn at last, and glad I was to leave the ship and the master, who gave me a
kick as I was getting over the side, bad luck to the dirty heretic for kicking a son of the
church, for I have always been a true son of the church, Shorsha, and never quarrelled with
it unless it interfered with me in my playing at cards.  I left Leghorn with certain muleteers,
with whom I played at cards at the baiting-houses, and who speedily won from me all the ha'pennies
and sixpences I had won from the sailors.  I got my money's worth, however, for I learnt from
the muleteers all kind of quaint tricks upon the cards, which I knew nothing of before; so
I did not grudge them what they chated me of, and when we parted we did so in kindness on both
sides.  On getting to--I was received into the religious house for Irishes.  It was the Irish
house, Shorsha, into which I was taken, for I do not wish ye to suppose that I was in the English
religious house which there is in that city, in which a purty set are educated, and in which
purty doings are going on if all tales be true.

"In this Irish house I commenced my studies, learning to sing and to read the Latin prayers
of the church.  'Faith, Shorsha, many's the sorrowful day I passed in that house learning the
prayers and litanies, being half- starved, with no earthly diversion at all, at all; until
I took the cards out of my chest and began instructing in card-playing the chum which I had
with me in my cell; then I had plenty of diversion along with him during the times when I was
not engaged in singing, and chanting, and saying the prayers of the church; there was, however,
some drawback in playing with my chum, for though he was very clever in learning, divil a sixpence
had he to play with, in which respect he was like myself, the master who taught him, who had
lost all my money to the muleteers who taught me the tricks upon the cards; by degrees, however,
it began to be noised about the religious house that Murtagh, from Hibrodary, {1} had a pack
of cards with which he played with his chum in the cell; whereupon other scholars of the religious
house came to me, some to be taught and others to play, so with some I played, and others I
taught, but neither to those who could play, or to those who could not, did I teach the elegant
tricks which I learnt from the muleteers.  Well, the scholars came to me for the sake of the
cards, and the porter and cook of the religious house, who could both play very well, came
also; at last I became tired of playing for nothing, so I borrowed a few bits of silver from
the cook, and played against the porter, and by means of my tricks I won money from the porter,
and then I paid the cook the bits of silver which I had borrowed of him; and played with him,
and won a little of his money, which I let him win back again, as I had lived long enough in
a religious house to know that it is dangerous to take money from the cook. In a little time,
Shorsha, there was scarcely anything going on in the house but card-playing; the almoner played
with me, and so did the sub- rector, and I won money from both; not too much, however, lest
they should tell the rector, who had the character of a very austere man, and of being a bit
of a saint; however, the thief of a porter, whose money I had won, informed the rector of what
was going on, and one day the rector sent for me into his private apartment, and gave me so
long and pious a lecture upon the heinous sin of card-playing, that I thought I should sink
into the ground; after about half-an-hour's inveighing against card- playing, he began to soften
his tone, and with a long sigh told me that at one time of his life he had been a young man
himself, and had occasionally used the cards; he then began to ask me some questions about
card-playing, which questions I afterwards found were to pump from me what I knew about the
science.  After a time he asked me whether I had got my cards with me, and on my telling him
I had, he expressed a wish to see them, whereupon I took the pack out of my pocket, and showed
it to him; he looked at it very attentively, and at last, giving another deep sigh, he said,
that though he was nearly weaned from the vanities of the world, he had still an inclination
to see whether he had entirely lost the little skill which at one time he possessed.  When
I heard him speak in this manner, I told him that if his reverence was inclined for a game
of cards, I should be very happy to play one with him; scarcely had I uttered these words than
he gave a third sigh, and looked so very much like a saint that I was afraid he was going to
excommunicate me.  Nothing of the kind, however, for presently he gets up and locks the door,
then sitting down at the table, he motioned me to do the same, which I did, and in five minutes
we were playing at cards, his reverence and myself.

"I soon found that his reverence knew quite as much about card-playing as I did.  Divil a trick
was there connected with cards that his reverence did not seem awake to.  As, however, we were
not playing for money, this circumstance did not give me much uneasiness; so we played game
after game for two hours, when his reverence, having business, told me I might go, so I took
up my cards, make my obedience, and left him.  The next day I had other games with him, and
so on for a very long time, still playing for nothing.  At last his reverence grew tired of
playing for nothing, and proposed that we should play for money.  Now, I had no desire to play
with his reverence for money, as I knew that doing so would bring on a quarrel.  As long as
we were playing for nothing, I could afford to let his reverence use what tricks he pleased;
but if we played for money, I couldn't do so.  If he played his tricks, I must play mine, and
use every advantage to save my money; and there was one I possessed which his reverence did
not.  The cards being my own, I had put some delicate little marks on the trump cards, just
at the edges, so that when I dealt, by means of a little sleight of hand, I could deal myself
any trump card I pleased.  But I wished, as I said before, to have no dealings for money with
his reverence, knowing that he was master in the house, and that he could lead me a dog of
a life if I offended him, either by winning his money, or not letting him win mine.  So I told
him I had no money to play with, but the ould thief knew better; he knew that I was every day
winning money from the scholars, and the sub-rector, and the other people of the house, and
the ould thaif had determined to let me go on in that way winning money, and then by means
of his tricks, which he thought I dare not resent, to win from me all my earnings--in a word,
Shorsha, to let me fill myself like a sponge, and then squeeze me for his own advantage.  So
he made me play with him, and in less than three days came on the quarrel; his reverence chated
me, and I chated his reverence; the ould thaif knew every trick that I knew, and one or two
more; but in daling out the cards I nicked his reverence; scarcely a trump did I ever give
him, Shorsha, and won his money purty freely.  Och, it was a purty quarrel!  All the delicate
names in the 'Newgate Calendar,' if ye ever heard of such a book; all the hang-dog names in
the Newgate histories, and the lives of Irish rogues, did we call each other--his reverence
and I!  Suddenly, however, putting out his hand, he seized the cards, saying, 'I will examine
these cards, ye cheating scoundrel! for I believe there are dirty marks on them, which ye have
made in order to know the winning cards.'  'Give me back my pack,' said I, 'or m'anam on Dioul
if I be not the death of ye!'  His reverence, however, clapped the cards into his pocket, and
made the best of his way to the door, I hanging upon him.  He was a gross, fat man, but, like
most fat men, deadly strong, so he forced his way to the door, and, opening it, flung himself
out, with me still holding on him like a terrier dog on a big fat pig; then he shouts for help,
and in a little time I was secured and thrust into a lock-up room, where I was left to myself.
Here was a purty alteration.  Yesterday I was the idol of the religious house, thought more
on than his reverence, every one paying me court and wurtship, and wanting to play cards with
me, and to learn my tricks, and fed, moreover, on the tidbits of the table; and to-day I was
in a cell, nobody coming to look at me but the blackguard porter who had charge of me, my cards
taken from me, and with nothing but bread and water to live upon.  Time passed dreary enough
for a month, at the end of which time his reverence came to me, leaving the porter just outside
the door in order to come to his help should I be violent; and then he read me a very purty
lecture on my conduct, saying I had turned the religious house topsy-turvy, and corrupted the
scholars, and that I was the cheat of the world, for that on inspecting the pack he had discovered
the dirty marks which I had made upon the trump cards for to know them by.  He said a great
deal more to me, which is not worth relating, and ended by telling me that he intended to let
me out of confinement next day, but that if ever I misconducted myself any more, he would clap
me in again for the rest of my life.  I had a good mind to call him an ould thaif, but the
hope of getting out made me hold my tongue, and the next day I was let out; and need enough
I had to be let out, for what with being alone, and living on bread and water, I was becoming
frighted, or, as the doctors call it, narvous.  But when I was out--oh, what a change I found
in the religious house! no card-playing, for it had been forbidden to the scholars, and there
was now nothing going on but reading and singing; divil a merry visage to be seen, but plenty
of prim airs and graces; but the case of the scholars, though bad enough, was not half so bad
as mine, for they could spake to each other, whereas I could not have a word of conversation,
for the ould thaif of a rector had ordered them to send me to 'Coventry,' telling them that
I was a gambling cheat, with morals bad enough to corrupt a horse regiment; and whereas they
were allowed to divert themselves with going out, I was kept reading and singing from morn
till night.  The only soul who was willing to exchange a word with me was the cook, and sometimes
he and I had a little bit of discourse in a corner, and we condoled with each other, for he
liked the change in the religious house almost as little as myself; but he told me that, for
all the change below stairs, there was still card-playing on above, for that the ould thaif
of a rector, and the sub- rector, and the almoner played at cards together, and that the rector
won money from the others--the almoner had told him so--and, moreover, that the rector was
the thaif of the world, and had once been kicked out of a club-house at Dublin for cheating
at cards, and after that circumstance had apparently reformed and lived decently till the time
when I came to the religious house with my pack, but that the sight of that had brought him
back to his ould gambling.  He told the cook, moreover, that the rector frequently went out
at night to the houses of the great clergy and cheated at cards.

"In this melancholy state, with respect to myself, things continued a long time, when suddenly
there was a report that his Holiness the Pope intended to pay a visit to the religious house
in order to examine into its discipline.  When I heard this I was glad, for I determined after
the Pope had done what he had come to do, to fall upon my knees before him, and make a regular
complaint of the treatment I had received, to tell him of the cheating at cards of the rector,
and to beg him to make the ould thaif give me back my pack again.  So the day of the visit
came, and his Holiness made his appearance with his attendants, and, having looked over the
religious house, he went into the rector's room with the rector, the sub-rector, and the almoner.
I intended to have waited until his Holiness came out, but finding he stayed a long time I
thought I would e'en go into him, so I went up to the door without anybody observing me--his
attendants being walking about the corridor--and opening it I slipped in, and there what do
you think I saw?  Why, his Holiness the Pope, and his reverence the rector, and the sub-rector,
and the almoner seated at cards; and the ould thaif of a rector was dealing out the cards which
ye had given me, Shorsha, to his Holiness the Pope, the sub-rector, the almoner, and himself."

In this part of his history I interrupted Murtagh, saying that I was afraid he was telling
untruths, and that it was highly improbable that the Pope would leave the Vatican to play cards
with Irish at their religious house, and that I was sure, if on his, Murtagh's authority, I
were to tell the world so, the world would never believe it.

"Then the world, Shorsha, would be a fool, even as you were just now saying you had frequently
believed it to be; the grand thing, Shorsha, is to be able to believe oneself; if ye can do
that, it matters very little whether the world believe ye or no.  But a purty thing for you
and the world to stickle at the Pope's playing at cards at a religious house of Irish; och!
if I were to tell you and the world, what the Pope has been sometimes at, at the religious
house of English thaives, I would excuse you and the world for turning up your eyes.  However,
I wish to say nothing against the Pope.  I am a son of the church, and if the Pope don't interfere
with my cards, divil a bit will I have to say against him; but I saw the Pope playing, or about
to play, with the pack which had been taken from me, and when I told the Pope, the Pope did
not--Ye had better let me go on with my history, Shorsha; whether you or the world believe
it or not, I am sure it is quite as true as your tale of the snake, or saying that Finn got
his burnt finger from the thaives of Loughlin; and whatever you may say, I am sure the world
will think so too."

I apologized to Murtagh for interrupting him, and telling him that his history, whether true
or not, was infinitely diverting, begged him to continue it.

CHAPTER XLVI

Murtagh's Story continued--The Priest, Exorcist, and Thimble-engro--How to Check a Rebellion.

I was telling ye, Shorsha, when ye interrupted me, that I found the Pope, the rector, the sub-rector,
and the almoner seated at the table, the rector with my pack of cards in his hands, about to
deal out to the Pope and the rest, not forgetting himself, for whom he intended all the trump-
cards, no doubt.  No sooner did they perceive me than they seemed taken all aback; but the
rector, suddenly starting up with the cards in his hand, asked me what I did there, threatening
to have me well disciplined if I did not go about my business; 'I am come for my pack,' said
I, 'ye ould thaif, and to tell his Holiness how I have been treated by ye;' then going down
on my knees before his Holiness, I said, 'Arrah, now, your Holiness! will ye not see justice
done to a poor boy who has been sadly misused?  The pack of cards which that old ruffian has
in his hand are my cards, which he has taken from me, in order to chate with.  Arrah! don't
play with him, your Holiness, for he'll only chate ye--there are dirty marks upon the cards
which bear the trumps, put there in order to know them by; and the ould thaif in daling out
will give himself all the good cards, and chate ye of the last farthing in your pocket; so
let them be taken from him, your Holiness, and given back to me; and order him to lave the
room, and then, if your Holiness be for an honest game, don't think I am the boy to baulk ye.
I'll take the old ruffian's place, and play with ye till evening, and all night besides, and
divil an advantage will I take of the dirty marks, though I know them all, having placed them
on the cards myself.'  I was going on in this way when the ould thaif of a rector, flinging
down the cards, made at me as if to kick me out of the room, whereupon I started up and said,
'If ye are for kicking, sure two can play at that;' and then I kicked at his reverence, and
his reverence at me, and there was a regular scrimmage between us, which frightened the Pope,
who, getting up, said some words which I did not understand, but which the cook afterwards
told me were, 'English extravagance, and this is the second edition;' for it seems that, a
little time before, his Holiness had been frightened in St. Peter's Church by the servant of
an English family, which those thaives of the English religious house had been endeavouring
to bring over to the Catholic faith, and who didn't approve of their being converted.  Och!
his Holiness did us all sore injustice to call us English, and to confound our house with the
other; for however dirty our house might be, our house was a clane house compared with the
English house, and we honest people compared with those English thaives.  Well, his Holiness
was frighted, and the almoner ran out, and brought in his Holiness's attendants, and they laid
hold of me, but I struggled hard, and said, 'I will not go without my pack; arrah, your Holiness!
make them give me my pack, which Shorsha gave me in Dungarvon times of old;' but my struggles
were of no use.  I was pulled away and put out in the ould dungeon, and his Holiness went away
sore frighted, crossing himself much, and never returned again.

"In the old dungeon I was fastened to the wall by a chain, and there I was disciplined once
every other day for the first three weeks, and then I was left to myself, and my chain, and
hunger; and there I sat in the dungeon, sometimes screeching, sometimes hallooing, for I soon
became frighted, having nothing in the cell to divert me.  At last the cook found his way to
me by stealth, and comforted me a little, bringing me tidbits out of the kitchen; and he visited
me again and again--not often, however, for he dare only come when he could steal away the
key from the custody of the thaif of a porter.  I was three years in the dungeon, and should
have gone mad but for the cook, and his words of comfort, and his tidbits, and nice books which
he brought me out of the library, which were the 'Calendars of Newgate,' and the 'Lives of
Irish Rogues and Raparees,' the only English books in the library.  However, at the end of
three years, the ould thaif of a rector, wishing to look at them books, missed them from the
library, and made a perquisition about them, and the thaif of a porter said that he shouldn't
wonder if I had them; saying that he had once seen me reading; and then the rector came with
others to my cell, and took my books from me, from under my straw, and asked me how I came
by them; and on my refusal to tell, they disciplined me again till the blood ran down my back;
and making more perquisition they at last accused the cook of having carried the books to me,
and not denying, he was given warning to leave next day, but he left that night, and took me
away with him; for he stole the key, and came to me and cut my chain through, and then he and
I escaped from the religious house through a window--the cook with a bundle, containing what
things he had.  No sooner had we got out than the honest cook gave me a little bit of money
and a loaf, and told me to follow a way which he pointed out, which he said would lead to the
sea; and then, having embraced me after the Italian way, he left me, and I never saw him again.
So I followed the way which the cook pointed out, and in two days reached a seaport called
Chiviter Vik, terribly foot-foundered, and there I met a sailor who spoke Irish, and who belonged
to a vessel just ready to sail for France; and the sailor took me on board his vessel, and
said I was his brother, and the captain gave me a passage to a place in France called Marseilles;
and when I got there, the captain and sailor got a little money for me and a passport, and
I travelled across the country towards a place they directed me to called Bayonne, from which
they said I might, perhaps, get to Ireland.  Coming, however, to a place called Pau, all my
money being gone, I enlisted into a regiment called the Army of the Faith, which was going
into Spain, for the King of Spain had been dethroned and imprisoned by his own subjects, as
perhaps you may have heard; and the King of France, who was his cousin, was sending an army
to help him, under the command of his own son, whom the English called Prince Hilt, because
when he was told that he was appointed to the command, he clapped his hand on the hilt of his
sword.  So I enlisted into the regiment of the Faith, which was made up of Spaniards, many
of them priests who had run out of Spain, and broken Germans, and foot-foundered Irish, like
myself.  It was said to be a blackguard regiment, that same regiment of the Faith; but, 'faith,
I saw nothing blackguardly going on in it, for you would hardly reckon card-playing and dominoes,
and pitch and toss blackguardly, and I saw nothing else in it.  There was one thing in it which
I disliked--the priests drawing their Spanish knives occasionally, when they lost their money.
After we had been some time at Pau, the army of the Faith was sent across the mountains into
Spain, as the vanguard of the French; and no sooner did the Spaniards see the Faith than they
made a dash at it, and the Faith ran away, myself along with it, and got behind the French
army, which told it to keep there, and the Faith did so, and followed the French army, which
soon scattered the Spaniards, and in the end placed the king on his throne again.  When the
war was over the Faith was disbanded; some of the foreigners, however, amongst whom I was one,
were put into a Guard regiment, and there I continued for more than a year.

"One day, being at a place called the Escurial, I took stock, as the tradesmen say, and found
I possessed the sum of eighty dollars won by playing at cards, for though I could not play
so well with the foreign cards as with the pack you gave me, Shorsha, I had yet contrived to
win money from the priests and soldiers of the Faith.  Finding myself possessed of such a capital,
I determined to leave the service, and to make the best of my way to Ireland; so I deserted,
but coming in an evil hour to a place they calls Torre Lodones, I found the priest playing
at cards with his parishioners.  The sight of the cards made me stop, and then, fool like,
notwithstanding the treasure I had about me, I must wish to play, so not being able to speak
their language, I made signs to them to let me play, and the priest and his thaives consented
willingly; so I sat down to cards with the priest and two of his parishioners, and in a little
time had won plenty of their money, but I had better never have done any such thing, for suddenly
the priest and all his parishioners set upon me and bate me, and took from me all I had, and
cast me out of the village more dead than alive.  Och! it's a bad village that, and if I had
known what it was I would have avoided it, or run straight through it, though I saw all the
card-playing in the world going on in it.  There is a proverb about it, as I was afterwards
told, old as the time of the Moors, which holds good to the present day--it is, that in Torre
Lodones there are twenty-four housekeepers, and twenty-five thieves, maning that all the people
are thaives, and the clergyman to boot, who is not reckoned a housekeeper; and troth I found
the clergyman the greatest thaif of the lot.  After being cast out of that village I travelled
for nearly a month, subsisting by begging tolerably well, for though most of the Spanish are
thaives, they are rather charitable; but though charitable thaives they do not like their own
being taken from them without leave being asked, as I found to my cost; for on my entering
a garden near Seville, without leave, to take an orange, the labourer came running up and struck
me to the ground with a hatchet, giving me a big wound in the arm.  I fainted with loss of
blood, and on reviving I found myself in a hospital at Seville, to which the labourer and the
people of the village had taken me.  I should have died of starvation in that hospital had
not some English people heard of me and come to see me; they tended me with food till I was
cured, and then paid my passage on board a ship to London, to which place the ship carried me.

"And now I was in London with five shillings in my pocket--all I had in the world--and that
did not last for long; and when it was gone I begged in the streets, but I did not get much
by that, except a month's hard labour in the correction-house; and when I came out I knew not
what to do, but thought I would take a walk in the country, for it was spring- time, and the
weather was fine, so I took a walk about seven miles from London, and came to a place where
a great fair was being held; and there I begged, but got nothing but a halfpenny, and was thinking
of going farther, when I saw a man with a table, like that of mine, playing with thimbles,
as you saw me.  I looked at the play, and saw him win money, and run away, and hunted by constables
more than once.  I kept following the man, and at last entered into conversation with him;
and learning from him that he was in want of a companion to help him, I offered to help him
if he would pay me; he looked at me from top to toe, and did not wish at first to have anything
to do with me, as he said my appearance was against me.  'Faith, Shorsha, he had better have
looked at home, for his appearance was not much in his favour: he looked very much like a Jew,
Shorsha.  However, he at last agreed to take me to be his companion, or bonnet as he called
it; and I was to keep a look-out, and let him know when constables were coming, and to spake
a good word for him occasionally, whilst he was chating folks with his thimbles and his pea.
So I became his bonnet, and assisted him in the fair, and in many other fairs beside; but I
did not like my occupation much, or rather my master, who, though not a big man, was a big
thaif, and an unkind one, for do all I could I could never give him pleasure; and he was continually
calling me fool and bogtrotter, and twitting me because I could not learn his thaives' Latin,
and discourse with him in it, and comparing me with another acquaintance, or bit of a pal of
his, whom he said he had parted with in the fair, and of whom he was fond of saying all kinds
of wonderful things, amongst others, that he knew the grammar of all tongues.  At last, wearied
with being twitted by him with not being able to learn his thaives' Greek, I proposed that
I should teach him Irish, that we should spake it together when we had anything to say in secret.
To that he consented willingly; but, och! a purty hand he made with Irish, 'faith, not much
better than I did with his thaives' Hebrew.  Then my turn came, and I twitted him nicely with
dulness, and compared him with a pal that I had in ould Ireland, in Dungarvon times of yore,
to whom I teached Irish, telling him that he was the broth of a boy, and not only knew the
grammar of all human tongues, but the dialects of the snakes besides; in fact, I tould him
all about your own sweet self, Shorsha, and many a dispute and quarrel had we together about
our pals, which was the cleverest fellow, his or mine.

"Well, after having been wid him about two months, I quitted him without noise, taking away
one of his tables, and some peas and thimbles; and that I did with a safe conscience, for he
paid me nothing, and was not over free with the meat and the drink, though I must say of him
that he was a clever fellow, and perfect master of his trade, by which he made a power of money,
and bating his not being able to learn Irish, and a certain Jewish lisp which he had, a great
master of his tongue, of which he was very proud; so much so, that he once told me that when
he had saved a certain sum of money he meant to leave off the thimbling business, and enter
Parliament; into which, he said, he could get at any time, through the interest of a friend
of his, a Tory Peer--my Lord Whitefeather, with whom, he said, he had occasionally done business.
With the table, and other things which I had taken, I commenced trade on my own account, having
contrived to learn a few of his tricks.  My only capital was the change for half-a-guinea,
which he had once let fall, and which I picked up, which was all I could ever get from him:
for it was impossible to stale any money from him, he was so awake, being up to all the tricks
of thaives, having followed the diving trade, as he called it, for a considerable time.  My
wish was to make enough by my table to enable me to return with credit to ould Ireland, where
I had no doubt of being able to get myself ordained as priest; and, in troth, notwithstanding
I was a beginner, and without any companion to help me, I did tolerably well, getting my meat
and drink, and increasing my small capital, till I came to this unlucky place of Horncastle,
where I was utterly ruined by the thaif in the rider's dress.  And now, Shorsha, I am after
telling you my history; perhaps you will now be telling me something about yourself?"

I told Murtagh all about myself that I deemed necessary to relate, and then asked him what
he intended to do; he repeated that he was utterly ruined, and that he had no prospect before
him but starving, or making away with himself.  I inquired "How much would take him to Ireland,
and establish him there with credit."  "Five pounds," he answered, adding, "but who in the
world would be fool enough to lend me five pounds, unless it be yourself, Shorsha, who, may
be, have not got it; for when you told me about yourself, you made no boast of the state of
your affairs."  "I am not very rich," I replied, "but I think I can accommodate you with what
you want.  I consider myself under great obligations to you, Murtagh; it was you who instructed
me in the language of Oilein nan Naomha, which has been the foundation of all my acquisitions
in philology; without you, I should not have been what I am--Lavengro! which signifies a philologist.
Here is the money, Murtagh," said I, putting my hand into my pocket, and taking out five pounds,
"much good may it do you."  He took the money, stared at it, and then at me--"And you mane
to give me this, Shorsha?"  "It is no longer mine to give," said I; "it is yours."  "And you
give it me for the gratitude you bear me?"  "Yes," said I, "and for Dungarvon times of old."
"Well, Shorsha," said he, "you are a broth of a boy, and I'll take your benefaction--five pounds!
och, Jasus!"  He then put the money in his pocket, and springing up, waved his hat three times,
uttering some old Irish cry; then, sitting down, he took my hand, and said, "Sure, Shorsha,
I'll be going thither; and when I get there, it is turning over another leaf I will be; I have
learnt a thing or two abroad; I will become a priest; that's the trade, Shorsha! and I will
cry out for repale; that's the cry, Shorsha! and I'll be a fool no longer."  "And what will
you do with your table?" said I.  "'Faith, I'll be taking it with me, Shorsha; and when I gets
to Ireland, I'll get it mended, and I will keep it in the house which I shall have; and when
I looks upon it, I will be thinking of all I have undergone."  "You had better leave it behind
you," said I; "if you take it with you, you will, perhaps, take up the thimble trade again
before you get to Ireland, and lose the money I am after giving you."  "No fear of that, Shorsha;
never will I play on that table again, Shorsha, till I get it mended, which shall not be till
I am a priest, and have a house in which to place it."

Murtagh and I then went into the town, where we had some refreshment together, and then parted
on our several ways.  I heard nothing of him for nearly a quarter of a century, when a person
who knew him well, coming from Ireland, and staying at my humble house, told me a great deal
about him.  He reached Ireland in safety, soon reconciled himself with his Church, and was
ordained a priest; in the priestly office he acquitted himself in a way very satisfactory,
upon the whole, to his superiors, having, as he frequently said, learned wisdom abroad.  The
Popish Church never fails to turn to account any particular gift which its servants may possess;
and discovering soon that Murtagh was endowed with considerable manual dexterity--proof of
which he frequently gave at cards, and at a singular game which he occasionally played at thimbles--it
selected him as a very fit person to play the part of exorcist; and accordingly he travelled
through a great part of Ireland, casting out devils from people possessed, which he afterwards
exhibited, sometimes in the shape of rabbits, and occasionally birds and fishes.  There is
a holy island in a lake in Ireland, to which the people resort at a particular season of the
year.  Here Murtagh frequently attended, and it was here that he performed a cure which will
cause his name long to be remembered in Ireland, delivering a possessed woman of two demons,
which he brandished aloft in his hands, in the shape of two large eels, and subsequently hurled
into the lake, amidst the shouts of an enthusiastic multitude.  Besides playing the part of
an exorcist, he acted that of a politician with considerable success; he attached himself to
the party of the sire of agitation--"the man of paunch," and preached and hallooed for repeal
with the loudest and best, as long as repeal was the cry; as soon, however, as the Whigs attained
the helm of Government, and the greater part of the loaves and fishes--more politely termed
the patronage of Ireland--was placed at the disposition of the priesthood, the tone of Murtagh,
like that of the rest of his brother saggarts, was considerably softened; he even went so far
as to declare that politics were not altogether consistent with sacerdotal duty; and resuming
his exorcisms, which he had for some time abandoned, he went to the Isle of Holiness, and delivered
a possessed woman of six demons in the shape of white mice. He, however, again resumed the
political mantle in the year 1848, during the short period of the rebellion of the so-called
Young Irelanders.  The priests, though they apparently sided with this party, did not approve
of it, as it was chiefly formed of ardent young men, fond of what they termed liberty, and
by no means admirers of priestly domination, being mostly Protestants.  Just before the outbreak
of this rebellion, it was determined between the priests and the ---, that this party should
be rendered comparatively innocuous by being deprived of the sinews of war--in other words,
certain sums of money which they had raised for their enterprise.  Murtagh was deemed the best
qualified person in Ireland to be entrusted with the delicate office of getting their money
from them.  Having received his instructions, he invited the leaders to his parsonage amongst
the mountains, under pretence of deliberating with them about what was to be done.  They arrived
there just before nightfall, dressed in red, yellow, and green, the colours so dear to enthusiastic
Irishmen; Murtagh received them with great apparent cordiality, and entered into a long discourse
with them, promising them the assistance of himself and order, and received from them a profusion
of thanks.  After a time Murtagh, observing, in a jocular tone, that consulting was dull work,
proposed a game of cards, and the leaders, though somewhat surprised, assenting, he went to
a closet, and taking out a pack of cards, laid it upon the table; it was a strange dirty pack,
and exhibited every mark of having seen very long service.  On one of its guests making some
remarks on the "ancientness" of its appearance, Murtagh observed that there was a very wonderful
history attached to that pack; it had been presented to him, he said, by a young gentleman,
a disciple of his, to whom, in Dungarvon times of yore, he had taught the Irish language, and
of whom he related some very extraordinary things; he added that he, Murtagh, had taken it
to ---, where it had once the happiness of being in the hands of the Holy Father; by a great
misfortune, he did not say what, he had lost possession of it, and had returned without it,
but had some time since recovered it; a nephew of his, who was being educated at--for a priest,
having found it in a nook of the college, and sent it to him.

Murtagh and the leaders then played various games with this pack, more especially one called
by the initiated "blind hookey," the result being that at the end of about two hours the leaders
found they had lost one- half of their funds; they now looked serious, and talked of leaving
the house, but Murtagh begging them to stay to supper, they consented.  After supper, at which
the guests drank rather freely, Murtagh said that, as he had not the least wish to win their
money, he intended to give them their revenge; he would not play at cards with them, he added,
but at a funny game of thimbles, at which they would be sure of winning back their own; then
going out, he brought in a table, tall and narrow, on which placing certain thimbles and a
pea, he proposed that they should stake whatever they pleased on the almost certainty of finding
the pea under the thimbles.  The leaders, after some hesitation, consented, and were at first
eminently successful, winning back the greater part of what they had lost; after some time,
however, Fortune, or rather Murtagh, turned against them, and then, instead of leaving off,
they doubled and trebled their stakes, and continued doing so until they had lost nearly the
whole of their funds.  Quite furious, they now swore that Murtagh had cheated them, and insisted
on having their property restored to them.  Murtagh, without a word of reply, went to the door,
and shouting into the passage something in Irish, the room was instantly filled with bogtrotters,
each at least six feet high, with a stout shillelah in his hand.  Murtagh then turning to his
guests, asked them what they meant by insulting an anointed priest; telling them that it was
not for the likes of them to avenge the wrongs of Ireland.  "I have been clane mistaken in
the whole of ye," said he, "I supposed ye Irish, but have found, to my sorrow, that ye are
nothing of the kind; purty fellows to pretend to be Irish, when there is not a word of Irish
on the tongue of any of ye, divil a ha'porth; the illigant young gentleman to whom I taught
Irish, in Dungarvon times of old, though not born in Ireland, has more Irish in him than any
ten of ye.  He is the boy to avenge the wrongs of Ireland, if ever foreigner is to do it."
Then saying something to the bogtrotters, they instantly cleared the room of the young Irelanders,
who retired sadly disconcerted; nevertheless, being very silly young fellows, they hoisted
the standard of rebellion; few, however, joining them, partly because they had no money, and
partly because the priests abused them with might and main, their rebellion ended in a lamentable
manner; themselves being seized and tried, and though convicted, not deemed of sufficient importance
to be sent to the scaffold, where they might have had the satisfaction of saying--

   "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."

My visitor, after saying that of the money won, Murtagh retained a considerable portion, that
a part went to the hierarchy for what were called church purposes, and that the--took the remainder,
which it employed in establishing a newspaper, in which the private characters of the worthiest
and most loyal Protestants in Ireland were traduced and vilified, concluded his account by
observing, that it was the common belief that Murtagh, having by his services, ecclesiastical
and political, acquired the confidence of the priesthood and favour of the Government, would,
on the first vacancy, be appointed to the high office of Popish Primate of Ireland.

CHAPTER XLVII

Departure from Horncastle--Recruiting Sergeant--Kauloes and Lolloes.

Leaving Horncastle I bent my steps in the direction of the east.  I walked at a brisk rate,
and late in the evening reached a large town, situate at the entrance of an extensive firth,
or arm of the sea, which prevented my farther progress eastward.  Sleeping that night in the
suburbs of the town, I departed early next morning in the direction of the south.  A walk of
about twenty miles brought me to another large town, situated on a river, where I again turned
towards the east.  At the end of the town I was accosted by a fiery-faced individual, somewhat
under the middle size, dressed as a recruiting sergeant.

"Young man," said the recruiting sergeant, "you are just the kind of person to serve the Honourable
East India Company."

"I had rather the Honourable Company should serve me," said I.

"Of course, young man.  Well, the Honourable East India Company shall serve you--that's reasonable.
Here, take this shilling; 'tis service- money.  The Honourable Company engages to serve you,
and you the Honourable Company; both parties shall be thus served; that's just and reasonable."

"And what must I do for the Company?"

"Only go to India; that's all."

"And what should I do in India?"

"Fight, my brave boy! fight, my youthful hero!"

"What kind of country is India?"

"The finest country in the world!  Rivers, bigger than the Ouse.  Hills, higher than anything
near Spalding!  Trees--you never saw such trees! Fruits--you never saw such fruits!"

"And the people--what kind of folk are they?"

"Pah!  Kauloes--blacks--a set of rascals not worth regarding."

"Kauloes!" said I; "blacks!"

"Yes," said the recruiting sergeant; "and they call us lolloes, which, in their beastly gibberish,
means red."

"Lolloes!" said I; "reds!"

"Yes," said the recruiting sergeant, "kauloes and lolloes; and all the lolloes have to do is
to kick and cut down the kauloes, and take from them their rupees, which mean silver money.
Why do you stare so?"

"Why," said I, "this is the very language of Mr. Petulengro."

"Mr. Pet--?"

"Yes," said I, "and Tawno Chikno."

"Tawno Chik--?  I say, young fellow, I don't like your way of speaking; no, nor your way of
looking.  You are mad, sir; you are mad; and what's this?  Why, your hair is grey!  You won't
do for the Honourable Company--they like red.  I'm glad I didn't give you the shilling.  Good
day to you."

"I shouldn't wonder," said I, as I proceeded rapidly along a broad causeway, in the direction
of the east, "if Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno came originally from India.  I think I'll
go there."

APPENDIX

CHAPTER I--A Word for Lavengro.

Lavengro is the history up to a certain period of one of rather a peculiar mind and system
of nerves, with an exterior shy and cold, under which lurk much curiosity, especially with
regard to what is wild and extraordinary, a considerable quantity of energy and industry, and
an unconquerable love of independence.  It narrates his earliest dreams and feelings, dwells
with minuteness on the ways, words, and characters of his father, mother, and brother, lingers
on the occasional resting-places of his wandering half military childhood, describes the gradual
hardening of his bodily frame by robust exercises, his successive struggles, after his family
and himself have settled down in a small local capital, to obtain knowledge of every kind,
but more particularly philological lore; his visits to the tent of the Romany chal, and the
parlour of the Anglo- German philosopher; the effect produced upon his character by his flinging
himself into contact with people all widely differing from each other, but all extraordinary;
his reluctance to settle down to the ordinary pursuits of life; his struggles after moral truth;
his glimpses of God and the obscuration of the Divine Being, to his mind's eye; and his being
cast upon the world of London by the death of his father, at the age of nineteen.  In the world
within a world, the world of London, it shows him playing his part for some time as he best
can, in the capacity of a writer for reviews and magazines, and describes what he saw and underwent
whilst labouring in that capacity; it represents him, however, as never forgetting that he
is the son of a brave but poor gentleman, and that if he is a hack author, he is likewise a
scholar.  It shows him doing no dishonourable jobs, and proves that if he occasionally associates
with low characters, he does so chiefly to gratify the curiosity of a scholar.  In his conversations
with the apple-woman of London Bridge, the scholar is ever apparent, so again in his acquaintance
with the man of the table, for the book is no raker up of the uncleanness of London, and if
it gives what at first sight appears refuse, it invariably shows that a pearl of some kind,
generally a philological one, is contained amongst it; it shows its hero always accompanied
by his love of independence, scorning in the greatest poverty to receive favours from anybody,
and describes him finally rescuing himself from peculiarly miserable circumstances by writing
a book, an original book, within a week, even as Johnson is said to have written his "Rasselas,"
and Beckford his "Vathek," and tells how, leaving London, he betakes himself to the roads and
fields.

In the country it shows him leading a life of roving adventure, becoming tinker, gypsy, postillion,
ostler; associating with various kinds of people, chiefly of the lower classes, whose ways
and habits are described; but, though leading this erratic life, we gather from the book that
his habits are neither vulgar nor vicious, that he still follows to a certain extent his favourite
pursuits, hunting after strange characters, or analysing strange words and names.  At the conclusion
of the last chapter, which terminates the first part of the history, it hints that he is about
to quit his native land on a grand philological expedition.

Those who read this book with attention--and the author begs to observe that it would be of
little utility to read it hurriedly--may derive much information with respect to matters of
philology and literature; it will be found treating of most of the principal languages from
Ireland to China, and of the literature which they contain; and it is particularly minute with
regard to the ways, manners, and speech of the English section of the most extraordinary and
mysterious clan or tribe of people to be found in the whole world--the children of Roma.  But
it contains matters of much more importance than anything in connection with philology, and
the literature and manners of nations.  Perhaps no work was ever offered to the public in which
the kindness and providence of God have been set forth by more striking examples, or the machinations
of priestcraft been more truly and lucidly exposed, or the dangers which result to a nation
when it abandons itself to effeminacy, and a rage for what is novel and fashionable, than the
present.

With respect to the kindness and providence of God, are they not exemplified in the case of
the old apple-woman and her son?  These are beings in many points bad, but with warm affections,
who, after an agonizing separation, are restored to each other, but not until the hearts of
both are changed and purified by the influence of affliction. Are they not exemplified in the
case of the rich gentleman, who touches objects in order to avert the evil chance?  This being
has great gifts and many amiable qualities, but does not everybody see that his besetting sin
is selfishness?  He fixes his mind on certain objects, and takes inordinate interest in them,
because they are his own, and those very objects, through the providence of God, which is kindness
in disguise, become snakes and scorpions to whip him.  Tired of various pursuits, he at last
becomes an author, and publishes a book, which is very much admired, and which he loves with
his usual inordinate affection; the book, consequently, becomes a viper to him, and at last
he flings it aside and begins another; the book, however, is not flung aside by the world,
who are benefited by it, deriving pleasure and knowledge from it: so the man who merely wrote
to gratify self, has already done good to others, and got himself an honourable name.  But
God will not allow that man to put that book under his head and use it as a pillow: the book
has become a viper to him, he has banished it, and is about another, which he finishes and
gives to the world; it is a better book than the first, and every one is delighted with it;
but it proves to the writer a scorpion, because he loves it with inordinate affection; but
it was good for the world that he produced this book, which stung him as a scorpion.  Yes;
and good for himself, for the labour of writing it amused him, and perhaps prevented him from
dying of apoplexy; but the book is banished, and another is begun, and herein, again, is the
providence of God manifested; the man has the power of producing still, and God determines
that he shall give to the world what remains in his brain, which he would not do, had he been
satisfied with the second work; he would have gone to sleep upon that as he would upon the
first, for the man is selfish and lazy.  In his account of what he suffered during the composition
of this work, his besetting sin of selfishness is manifest enough; the work on which he is
engaged occupies his every thought, it is his idol, his deity, it shall be all his own, he
won't borrow a thought from any one else, and he is so afraid lest, when he publishes it, that
it should be thought that he had borrowed from any one, that he is continually touching objects,
his nervous system, owing to his extreme selfishness, having become partly deranged.  He is
left touching, in order to banish the evil chance from his book, his deity.  No more of his
history is given; but does the reader think that God will permit that man to go to sleep on
his third book, however extraordinary it may be?  Assuredly not. God will not permit that man
to rest till he has cured him to a certain extent of his selfishness, which has, however, hitherto
been very useful to the world.

Then, again, in the tale of Peter Williams, is not the hand of Providence to be seen?  This
person commits a sin in his childhood, utters words of blasphemy, the remembrance of which,
in after life, preying upon his imagination, unfits him for quiet pursuits, to which he seems
to have been naturally inclined; but for the remembrance of that sin, he would have been Peter
Williams the quiet and respectable Welsh farmer, somewhat fond of reading the ancient literature
of his country in winter evenings, after his work was done.  God, however, was aware that there
was something in Peter Williams to entitle him to assume a higher calling; he therefore permits
this sin, which, though a childish affair, was yet a sin, and committed deliberately, to prey
upon his mind till he becomes at last an instrument in the hand of God, a humble Paul, the
great preacher, Peter Williams, who, though he considers himself a reprobate and a castaway,
instead of having recourse to drinking in mad desperation, as many do who consider themselves
reprobates, goes about Wales and England preaching the word of God, dilating on his power and
majesty, and visiting the sick and afflicted, until God sees fit to restore to him his peace
of mind; which he does not do, however, until that mind is in a proper condition to receive
peace, till it has been purified by the pain of the one idea which has so long been permitted
to riot in his brain; which pain, however, an angel, in the shape of a gentle faithful wife,
had occasionally alleviated; for God is merciful even in the blows which He bestoweth, and
will not permit any one to be tempted beyond the measure which he can support.  And here it
will be as well for the reader to ponder upon the means by which the Welsh preacher is relieved
from his mental misery: he is not relieved by a text from the Bible, by the words of consolation
and wisdom addressed to him by his angel-minded wife, nor by the preaching of one yet more
eloquent than himself; but by a quotation made by Lavengro from the life of Mary Flanders,
cut-purse and prostitute, which life Lavengro had been in the habit of reading at the stall
of his old friend the apple-woman, on London Bridge, who had herself been very much addicted
to the perusal of it, though without any profit whatever.  Should the reader be dissatisfied
with the manner in which Peter Williams is made to find relief, the author would wish to answer,
that the Almighty frequently accomplishes his purposes by means which appear very singular
to the eyes of men, and at the same time to observe that the manner in which that relief is
obtained, is calculated to read a lesson to the proud, fanciful, and squeamish, who are ever
in a fidget lest they should be thought to mix with low society, or to bestow a moment's attention
on publications which are not what is called of a perfectly unobjectionable character.  Had
not Lavengro formed the acquaintance of the apple-woman on London Bridge, he would not have
had an opportunity of reading the life of Mary Flanders; and, consequently, of storing in a
memory, which never forgets anything, a passage which contained a balm for the agonized mind
of poor Peter Williams.  The best medicines are not always found in the finest shops.  Suppose,
for example, if, instead of going to London Bridge to read, he had gone to Albemarle Street,
and had received from the proprietors of the literary establishment in that very fashionable
street, permission to read the publications on the tables of the saloons there, does the reader
think he would have met any balm in those publications for the case of Peter Williams? does
the reader suppose that he would have found Mary Flanders there?  He would certainly have found
that highly unobjectionable publication, "Rasselas," and the "Spectator," or "Lives of Royal
and Illustrious Personages," but, of a surety, no Mary Flanders; so when Lavengro met with
Peter Williams, he would have been unprovided with a balm to cure his ulcerated mind, and have
parted from him in a way not quite so satisfactory as the manner in which he took his leave
of him; for it is certain that he might have read "Rasselas," and all other unexceptionable
works to be found in the library of Albemarle Street, over and over again, before he would
have found any cure in them for the case of Peter Williams.  Therefore the author requests
the reader to drop any squeamish nonsense he may wish to utter about Mary Flanders, and the
manner in which Peter Williams was cured.

And now with respect to the old man who knew Chinese, but could not tell what was o'clock.
This individual was a man whose natural powers would have been utterly buried and lost beneath
a mountain of sloth and laziness, had not God determined otherwise.  He had in his early years
chalked out for himself a plan of life in which he had his own ease and self-indulgence solely
in view; he had no particular bad passions to gratify, he only wished to live a happy quiet
life, just as if the business of this mighty world could be carried on by innocent people fond
of ease or quiet, or that Providence would permit innocent quiet drones to occupy any portion
of the earth and to cumber it.  God had at any rate decreed that this man should not cumber
it as a drone.  He brings a certain affliction upon him, the agony of which produces that terrible
whirling of the brain which, unless it is stopped in time, produces madness; he suffers indescribable
misery for a period, until one morning his attention is arrested, and his curiosity is aroused,
by certain Chinese letters on a teapot; his curiosity increases more and more, and, of course,
in proportion as his curiosity is increased with respect to the Chinese marks, the misery in
his brain, produced by his mental affliction, decreases.  He sets about learning Chinese, and
after the lapse of many years, during which his mind subsides into a certain state of tranquillity,
he acquires sufficient knowledge of Chinese to be able to translate with ease the inscriptions
to be found on its singular crockery.  Yes, the laziest of human beings, through the Providence
of God, a being too of rather inferior capacity, acquires the written part of a language so
difficult that, as Lavengro said on a former occasion, none but the cleverest people in Europe,
the French, are able to acquire it.  But God did not intend that man should merely acquire
Chinese.  He intended that he should be of use to his species, and by the instrumentality of
the first Chinese inscription which he translates, the one which first arrested his curiosity,
he is taught the duty of hospitality; yes, by means of an inscription in the language of a
people, who have scarcely an idea of hospitality themselves, God causes the slothful man to
play a useful and beneficent part in the world, relieving distressed wanderers, and, amongst
others, Lavengro himself.  But a striking indication of the man's surprising sloth is still
apparent in what he omits to do; he has learnt Chinese, the most difficult of languages, and
he practises acts of hospitality, because he believes himself enjoined to do so by the Chinese
inscription, but he cannot tell the hour of the day by the clock within his house; he can get
on, he thinks, very well without being able to do so; therefore from this one omission, it
is easy to come to a conclusion as to what a sluggard's part the man would have played in life,
but for the dispensation of Providence; nothing but extreme agony could have induced such a
man to do anything useful.  He still continues, with all he has acquired, with all his usefulness,
and with all his innocence of character, without any proper sense of religion, though he has
attained a rather advanced age. If it be observed, that this want of religion is a great defect
in the story, the author begs leave to observe that he cannot help it.  Lavengro relates the
lives of people so far as they were placed before him, but no further.  It was certainly a
great defect in so good a man to be without religion; it was likewise a great defect in so
learned a man not to be able to tell what was o'clock.  It is probable that God, in his loving
kindness, will not permit that man to go out of the world without religion; who knows but some
powerful minister of the church full of zeal for the glory of God, will illume that man's dark
mind; perhaps some clergyman will come to the parish who will visit him and teach him his duty
to his God.  Yes, it is very probable that such a man, before he dies, will have been made
to love his God; whether he will ever learn to know what's o'clock is another matter.  It is
probable that he will go out of the world without knowing what's o'clock.  It is not so necessary
to be able to tell the time of day by the clock as to know one's God through His inspired word;
a man cannot get to heaven without religion, but a man can get there very comfortably without
knowing what's o'clock.

But, above all, the care and providence of God are manifested in the case of Lavengro himself,
by the manner in which he is enabled to make his way in the world up to a certain period, without
falling a prey either to vice or poverty.  In his history, there is a wonderful illustration
of part of the text, quoted by his mother, "I have been young, but now am old, yet never saw
I the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging his bread."  He is the son of good and honourable
parents, but at the critical period of life, that of entering into the world, he finds himself
without any earthly friend to help him, yet he manages to make his way; he does not become
a Captain in the Life Guards, it is true, nor does he get into Parliament, nor does the last
volume conclude in the most satisfactory and unobjectionable manner, by his marrying a dowager
countess, as that wise man Addison did, or by his settling down as a great country gentleman,
perfectly happy and contented, like the very moral Roderick Random, or the equally estimable
Peregrine Pickle; he is hack author, gypsy, tinker, and postillion, yet, upon the whole, he
seems to be quite as happy as the younger sons of most earls, to have as high feelings of honour;
and when the reader loses sight of him, he has money in his pocket honestly acquired, to enable
him to commence a journey quite as laudable as those which the younger sons of earls generally
undertake.  Surely all this is a manifestation of the kindness and providence of God: and yet
he is not a religious person; up to the time when the reader loses sight of him, he is decidedly
not a religious person; he has glimpses, it is true, of that God who does not forsake him,
but he prays very seldom, is not fond of going to church; and, though he admires Tate and Brady's
version of the Psalms, his admiration is rather caused by the beautiful poetry which that version
contains than the religion; yet his tale is not finished--like the tale of the gentleman who
touched objects, and that of the old man who knew Chinese without knowing what was o'clock;
perhaps, like them, he is destined to become religious, and to have, instead of occasional
glimpses, frequent and distinct views of his God; yet, though he may become religious, it is
hardly to be expected that he will become a very precise and straightlaced person; it is probable
that he will retain, with his scholarship, something of his gypsyism, his predilection for
the hammer and tongs, and perhaps some inclination to put on certain gloves, not white kid,
with any friend who may be inclined for a little old English diversion, and a readiness to
take a glass of ale, with plenty of malt in it, and as little hop as may well be--ale at least
two years old--with the aforesaid friend, when the diversion is over; for, as it is the belief
of the writer that a person may get to heaven very comfortably without knowing what's o'clock,
so it is his belief that he will not be refused admission there, because to the last he has
been fond of healthy and invigorating exercises, and felt a willingness to partake of any of
the good things which it pleases the Almighty to put within the reach of his children during
their sojourn upon earth.

CHAPTER II--On Priestcraft.

The writer will now say a few words about priestcraft, and the machinations of Rome, and will
afterwards say something about himself, and his motives for writing against them.

With respect to Rome, and her machinations, much valuable information can be obtained from
particular parts of Lavengro, and its sequel.  Shortly before the time when the hero of the
book is launched into the world, the Popish agitation in England had commenced.  The Popish
propaganda had determined to make a grand attempt on England; Popish priests were scattered
over the land, doing the best they could to make converts to the old superstition.  With the
plans of Rome, and her hopes, and the reasons on which those hopes are grounded, the hero of
the book becomes acquainted, during an expedition which he makes into the country, from certain
conversations which he holds with a priest in a dingle, in which the hero had taken up his
residence; he likewise learns from the same person much of the secret history of the Roman
See, and many matters connected with the origin and progress of the Popish superstition.  The
individual with whom he holds these conversations is a learned, intelligent, but highly-unprincipled
person, of a character however very common amongst the priests of Rome, who in general are
people void of all religion, and who, notwithstanding they are tied to Rome by a band which
they have neither the power nor wish to break, turn her and her practices, over their cups
with their confidential associates, to a ridicule only exceeded by that to which they turn
those who become the dupes of their mistress and themselves.

It is now necessary that the writer should say something with respect to himself, and his motives
for waging war against Rome.  First of all, with respect to himself, he wishes to state, that
to the very last moment of his life, he will do and say all that in his power may be to hold
up to contempt and execration the priestcraft and practices of Rome; there is, perhaps, no
person better acquainted than himself, not even among the choicest spirits of the priesthood,
with the origin and history of Popery.  From what he saw and heard of Popery in England, at
a very early period of his life, his curiosity was aroused, and he spared himself no trouble,
either by travel or study, to make himself well acquainted with it in all its phases, the result
being a hatred of it, which he hopes and trusts he shall retain till the moment when his spirit
quits the body. Popery is the great lie of the world; a source from which more misery and social
degradation have flowed upon the human race, than from all the other sources from which those
evils come.  It is the oldest of all superstitions; and though in Europe it assumes the name
of Christianity, it existed and flourished amidst the Himalayan hills at least two thousand
years before the real Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea; in a word, it is Buddhism; and
let those who may be disposed to doubt this assertion, compare the Popery of Rome, and the
superstitious practices of its followers, with the doings of the priests who surround the grand
Lama; and the mouthings, bellowing, turnings round, and, above all, the penances of the followers
of Buddh with those of Roman devotees.  But he is not going to dwell here on this point; it
is dwelt upon at tolerable length in the text, and has likewise been handled with extraordinary
power by the pen of the gifted but irreligious Volney; moreover, the elite of the Roman priesthood
are perfectly well aware that their system is nothing but Buddhism under a slight disguise,
and the European world in general has entertained for some time past an inkling of the fact.

And now a few words with respect to the motives of the writer for expressing a hatred for Rome.

This expressed abhorrence of the author for Rome might be entitled to little regard, provided
it were possible to attribute it to any self-interested motive.  There have been professed
enemies of Rome, or of this or that system; but their professed enmity may frequently be traced
to some cause which does them little credit; but the writer of these lines has no motive, and
can have no motive, for his enmity to Rome, save the abhorrence of an honest heart for what
is false, base, and cruel.  A certain clergyman wrote with much heat against the Papists in
the time of--who was known to favour the Papists, but was not expected to continue long in
office, and whose supposed successor, the person, indeed, who did succeed him, was thought
to be hostile to the Papists.  This divine, who obtained a rich benefice from the successor
of--who during ---'s time had always opposed him in everything he proposed to do, and who,
of course, during that time affected to be very inimical to Popery--this divine might well
be suspected of having a motive equally creditable for writing against the Papists, as that
which induced him to write for them, as soon as his patron, who eventually did something more
for him, had espoused their cause; but what motive, save an honest one, can the present writer
have, for expressing an abhorrence of Popery?  He is no clergyman, and consequently can expect
neither benefices nor bishoprics, supposing it were the fashion of the present, or likely to
be the fashion of any future administration, to reward clergymen with benefices or bishoprics,
who, in the defence of the religion of their country write, or shall write, against Popery,
and not to reward those who write, or shall write, in favour of it, and all its nonsense and
abominations.

"But if not a clergyman, he is the servant of a certain society, which has the overthrow of
Popery in view, and therefore," etc.  This assertion, which has been frequently made, is incorrect,
even as those who have made it probably knew it to be.  He is the servant of no society whatever.
He eats his own bread, and is one of the very few men in England who are independent in every
sense of the word.

It is true he went to Spain with the colours of that society on his hat--oh! the blood glows
in his veins! oh! the marrow awakes in his old bones when he thinks of what he accomplished
in Spain in the cause of religion and civilization with the colours of that society in his
hat, and its weapon in his hand, even the sword of the word of God; how with that weapon he
hewed left and right, making the priests fly before him, and run away squeaking: "Vaya! que
demonio es este!"  Ay, and when he thinks of the plenty of Bible swords which he left behind
him, destined to prove, and which have already proved, pretty calthrops in the heels of Popery.
"Halloo! Batuschca," he exclaimed the other night, on reading an article in a newspaper; "what
do you think of the present doings in Spain?  Your old friend the zingaro, the gitano who rode
about Spain, to say nothing of Galicia, with the Greek Buchini behind him as his squire, had
a hand in bringing them about; there are many brave Spaniards connected with the present movement
who took Bibles from his hands, and read them and profited by them, learning from the inspired
page the duties of one man towards another, and the real value of a priesthood and their head,
who set at nought the word of God, and think only of their own temporal interests; ay, and
who learned Gitano--their own Gitano--from the lips of the London Caloro, and also songs in
the said Gitano, very fit to dumbfounder your semi-Buddhist priests when they attempt to bewilder
people's minds with their school-logic and pseudo-ecclesiastical nonsense, songs such as--

   "Un Erajai
   Sinaba chibando un sermon--."

- But with that society he has long since ceased to have any connection; he bade it adieu with
feelings of love and admiration more than fourteen years ago; so, in continuing to assault
Popery, no hopes of interest founded on that society can sway his mind--interest! who, with
worldly interest in view, would ever have anything to do with that society?  It is poor and
supported, like its founder Christ, by poor people; and so far from having political influence,
it is in such disfavour, and has ever been, with the dastardly great, to whom the government
of England has for many years past been confided, that they having borne its colours only for
a month would be sufficient to exclude any man, whatever his talents, his learning, or his
courage may be, from the slightest chance of being permitted to serve his country either for
fee, or without.  A fellow who unites in himself the bankrupt trader, the broken author, or
rather book-maker, and the laughed-down single speech spouter of the House of Commons, may
look forward, always supposing that at one time he has been a foaming radical, to the government
of an important colony.  Ay, an ancient fox who has lost his tail may, provided he has a score
of radical friends, who will swear that he can bark Chinese, though Chinese is not barked but
sung, be forced upon a Chinese colony, though it is well known that to have lost one's tail
is considered by the Chinese in general as an irreparable infamy, whilst to have been once
connected with a certain society, to which, to its honour be it said, all the radical party
are vehemently hostile, would be quite sufficient to keep any one not only from a government,
but something much less, even though he could translate the rhymed "Sessions of Hariri," and
were versed, still retaining his tail, in the two languages in which Kien-Loung wrote his Eulogium
on Moukden, that piece which, translated by Amyot, the learned Jesuit, won the applause of
the celebrated Voltaire.

No! were the author influenced by hopes of fee or reward, he would, instead of writing against
Popery, write for it; all the trumpery titled--he will not call them great again--would then
be for him, and their masters the radicals, with their hosts of newspapers, would be for him,
more especially if he would commence maligning the society whose colours he had once on his
hat--a society which, as the priest says in the text, is one of the very few Protestant institutions
for which the Popish Church entertains any fear, and consequently respect, as it respects nothing
which it does not fear.  The writer said that certain "rulers" would never forgive him for
having been connected with that society; he went perhaps too far in saying "never."  It is
probable that they would take him into favour on one condition, which is, that he should turn
his pen and his voice against that society; such a mark "of a better way of thinking" would
perhaps induce them to give him a government, nearly as good as that which they gave to a certain
ancient radical fox at the intercession of his radical friends (who were bound to keep him
from the pauper's kennel), after he had promised to foam, bark, and snarl at corruption no
more; he might even entertain hopes of succeeding, nay, of superseding, the ancient creature
in his government; but even were he as badly off as he is well off, he would do no such thing.
He would rather exist on crusts and water; he has often done so, and been happy; nay, he would
rather starve than be a rogue--for even the feeling of starvation is happiness compared with
what he feels who knows himself to be a rogue, provided he has any feeling at all.  What is
the use of a mitre or knighthood to a man who has betrayed his principles? What is the use
of a gilt collar, nay, even of a pair of scarlet breeches, to a fox who has lost his tail?
Oh! the horror which haunts the mind of a fox who has lost his tail; and with reason, for his
very mate loathes him, and more especially if, like himself, she has lost her brush.  Oh! the
horror which haunts the mind of the two-legged rogue who has parted with his principles, or
those which he professed--for what? We'll suppose a government.  What's the use of a government,
if the next day after you have received it, you are obliged for very shame to scurry off to
it with the hoot of every honest man sounding in your ears?

   "Lightly liar leaped and away ran."

   PIERS PLOWMAN.

But bigotry, it has been said, makes the author write against Popery; and thorough-going bigotry,
indeed, will make a person say or do anything. But the writer is a very pretty bigot truly!
Where will the public find traces of bigotry in anything he has written?  He has written against
Rome with all his heart, with all his mind, with all his soul, and with all his strength; but
as a person may be quite honest, and speak and write against Rome, in like manner he may speak
and write against her, and be quite free from bigotry; though it is impossible for any one
but a bigot or a bad man to write or speak in her praise; her doctrines, actions, and machinations
being what they are.

Bigotry!  The author was born, and has always continued in the wrong church for bigotry, the
quiet, unpretending Church of England; a church which, had it been a bigoted church, and not
long suffering almost to a fault, might with its opportunities, as the priest says in the text,
have stood in a very different position from that which it occupies at present.  No! let those
who are in search of bigotry, seek for it in a church very different from the inoffensive Church
of England, which never encourages cruelty or calumny.  Let them seek for it amongst the members
of the Church of Rome, and more especially amongst those who have renegaded to it.  There is
nothing, however false and horrible, which a pervert to Rome will not say for his church, and
which his priests will not encourage him in saying; and there is nothing, however horrible--the
more horrible indeed and revolting to human nature, the more eager he would be to do it--which
he will not do for it, and which his priests will not encourage him in doing.

Of the readiness which converts to Popery exhibit to sacrifice all the ties of blood and affection
on the shrine of their newly-adopted religion, there is a curious illustration in the work
of Luigi Pulci. This man, who was born at Florence in the year 1432, and who was deeply versed
in the Bible, composed a poem, called the "Morgante Maggiore," which he recited at the table
of Lorenzo de Medici, the great patron of Italian genius.  It is a mock-heroic and religious
poem, in which the legends of knight-errantry, and of the Popish Church, are turned to unbounded
ridicule.  The pretended hero of it is a converted giant, called Morgante; though his adventures
do not occupy the twentieth part of the poem, the principal personages being Charlemagne, Orlando,
and his cousin Rinaldo of Montalban.  Morgante has two brothers, both of them giants, and in
the first canto of the poem, Morgante is represented with his brothers as carrying on a feud
with the abbot and monks of a certain convent, built upon the confines of heathenesse; the
giants being in the habit of flinging down stones, or rather huge rocks, on the convent. Orlando,
however, who is banished from the court of Charlemagne, arriving at the convent, undertakes
to destroy them, and, accordingly, kills Passamonte and Alabastro, and converts Morgante, whose
mind had been previously softened by a vision, in which the "Blessed Virgin" figures. No sooner
is he converted than, as a sign of his penitence, what does he do, but hastens and cuts off
the hands of his two brothers, saying--

   "Io vo' tagliar le mani a tutti quanti
   E porterolle a que' monaci santi."

And he does cut off the hands of his brethren, and carries them to the abbot, who blesses him
for so doing.  Pulci here is holding up to ridicule and execration the horrid butchery or betrayal
of friends by popish converts, and the encouragement they receive from the priest.  No sooner
is a person converted to Popery, than his principal thought is how he can bring the hands and
feet of his brethren, however harmless they may be, and different from the giants, to the "holy
priests," who, if he manages to do so, never fail to praise him, saying to the miserable wretch,
as the abbot said to Morgante:--

   "Tu sarai or perfetto e vero amico
   A Cristo, quanto tu gli eri nemico."

Can the English public deny the justice of Pulci's illustration, after something which it has
lately witnessed?  Has it not seen equivalents for the hands and feet of brothers carried by
popish perverts to the "holy priests," and has it not seen the manner in which the offering
has been received?  Let those who are in quest of bigotry seek for it among the perverts to
Rome, and not amongst those who, born in the pale of the Church of England, have always continued
in it.

CHAPTER III--On Foreign Nonsense.

With respect to the third point, various lessons which the book reads to the nation at large,
and which it would be well for the nation to ponder and profit by.

There are many species of nonsense to which the nation is much addicted, and of which the perusal
of Lavengro ought to give them a wholesome shame.  First of all, with respect to the foreign
nonsense so prevalent now in England.  The hero is a scholar; but, though possessed of a great
many tongues, he affects to be neither Frenchman, nor German, nor this or that foreigner; he
is one who loves his country, and the language and literature of his country, and speaks up
for each and all when there is occasion to do so.  Now what is the case with nine out of ten
amongst those of the English who study foreign languages?  No sooner have they picked up a
smattering of this or that speech than they begin to abuse their own country, and everything
connected with it, more especially its language.  This is particularly the case with those
who call themselves German students.  It is said, and the writer believes with truth, that
when a woman falls in love with a particularly ugly fellow, she squeezes him with ten times
more zest than she would a handsome one, if captivated by him.  So it is with these German
students; no sooner have they taken German in hand than there is nothing like German.  Oh,
the dear delightful German!  How proud I am that it is now my own, and that its divine literature
is within my reach!  And all this whilst mumbling the most uncouth speech, and crunching the
most crabbed literature in Europe. The writer is not an exclusive admirer of everything English;
he does not advise his country people never to go abroad, never to study foreign languages,
and he does not wish to persuade them that there is nothing beautiful or valuable in foreign
literature; he only wishes that they would not make themselves fools with respect to foreign
people, foreign languages or reading; that if they chance to have been in Spain, and have picked
up a little Spanish, they would not affect the airs of Spaniards; that if males they would
not make Tomfools of themselves by sticking cigars into their mouths, dressing themselves in
zamarras, and saying, carajo! {2} and if females that they would not make zanies of themselves
by sticking cigars into their mouths, flinging mantillas over their heads, and by saying carai,
and perhaps carajo too; or if they have been in France or Italy, and have picked up a little
French or Italian, they would not affect to be French or Italians; and particularly, after
having been a month or two in Germany, or picked up a little German in England, they would
not make themselves foolish about everything German, as the Anglo-German in the book does--a
real character, the founder of the Anglo- German school in England, and the cleverest Englishman
who ever talked or wrote encomiastic nonsense about Germany and the Germans.  Of all infatuations
connected with what is foreign, the infatuation about everything that is German, to a certain
extent prevalent in England, is assuredly the most ridiculous.  One can find something like
a palliation for people making themselves somewhat foolish about particular languages, literatures,
and people.  The Spanish certainly is a noble language, and there is something wild and captivating
in the Spanish character, and its literature contains the grand book of the world.  French
is a manly language.  The French are the great martial people in the world; and French literature
is admirable in many respects.  Italian is a sweet language, and of beautiful simplicity--its
literature perhaps the first in the world.  The Italians!--wonderful men have sprung up in
Italy. Italy is not merely famous for painters, poets, musicians, singers, and linguists--the
greatest linguist the world ever saw, the late Cardinal Mezzofanti, was an Italian; but it
is celebrated for men--men emphatically speaking: Columbus was an Italian, Alexander Farnese
was an Italian, so was the mightiest of the mighty, Napoleon Bonaparte;--but the German language,
German literature, and the Germans!  The writer has already stated his opinion with respect
to German; he does not speak from ignorance or prejudice; he has heard German spoken, and many
other languages.  German literature!  He does not speak from ignorance, he has read that and
many a literature, and he repeats-- However, he acknowledges that there is one fine poem in
the German language, that poem is the "Oberon;" a poem, by the bye, ignored by the Germans--a
speaking fact--and of course, by the Anglo-Germanists.  The Germans! he has been amongst them,
and amongst many other nations, and confesses that his opinion of the Germans, as men, is a
very low one.  Germany, it is true, has produced one very great man, the monk who fought the
Pope, and nearly knocked him down; but this man his countrymen--a telling fact--affect to despise,
and, of course, the Anglo-Germanists: the father of Anglo-Germanism was very fond of inveighing
against Luther.

The madness, or rather foolery, of the English for foreign customs, dresses, and languages,
is not an affair of to-day, or yesterday--it is of very ancient date, and was very properly
exposed nearly three centuries ago by one Andrew Borde, who under the picture of a "Naked man,
with a pair of shears in one hand, and a roll of cloth in the other," {3} inserted the following
lines along with others:--

   "I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here,
   Musing in my mind what garment I shall weare;
   For now I will weare this, and now I will weare that,
   Now I will weare, I cannot tell what.
   All new fashions be pleasant to mee,
   I will have them, whether I thrive or thee;
   What do I care if all the world me fail?
   I will have a garment reach to my taile;
   Then am I a minion, for I wear the new guise.
   The next yeare after I hope to be wise,
   Not only in wearing my gorgeous array,
   For I will go to learning a whole summer's day;
   I will learn Latine, Hebrew, Greek, and French,
   And I will learn Dutch, sitting on my bench.
   I had no peere if to myself I were true,
   Because I am not so, divers times do I rue.
   Yet I lacke nothing, I have all things at will
   If I were wise and would hold myself still,
   And meddle with no matters but to me pertaining,
   But ever to be true to God and my king.
   But I have such matters rowling in my pate,
   That I will and do--I cannot tell what," etc.

CHAPTER IV--On Gentility Nonsense--Illustrations of Gentility.

What is gentility?  People in different stations in England--entertain different ideas of what
is genteel, {4} but it must be something gorgeous, glittering, or tawdry, to be considered
genteel by any of them. The beau-ideal of the English aristocracy, of course with some exceptions,
is some young fellow with an imperial title, a military personage of course, for what is military
is so particularly genteel, with flaming epaulets, a cocked hat and plume, a prancing charger,
and a band of fellows called generals and colonels, with flaming epaulets, cocked hats and
plumes, and prancing chargers vapouring behind him.  It was but lately that the daughter of
an English marquis was heard to say, that the sole remaining wish of her heart--she had known
misfortunes, and was not far from fifty--was to be introduced to--whom?  The Emperor of Austria!
The sole remaining wish of the heart of one who ought to have been thinking of the grave and
judgment, was to be introduced to the miscreant who had caused the blood of noble Hungarian
females to be whipped out of their shoulders, for no other crime than devotion to their country,
and its tall and heroic sons.  The middle classes--of course there are some exceptions--admire
the aristocracy, and consider them pinks, the aristocracy who admire the Emperor of Austria,
and adored the Emperor of Russia, till he became old, ugly, and unfortunate, when their adoration
instantly terminated; for what is more ungenteel than age, ugliness, and misfortune!  The beau-ideal
with those of the lower classes, with peasants and mechanics, is some flourishing railroad
contractor: look, for example, how they worship Mr. Flamson.  This person makes his grand debut
in the year 'thirty-nine, at a public meeting in the principal room of a country inn.  He has
come into the neighbourhood with the character of a man worth a million pounds, who is to make
everybody's fortune; at this time, however, he is not worth a shilling of his own, though he
flashes about dexterously three or four thousand pounds, part of which sum he has obtained
by specious pretences, and part from certain individuals who are his confederates.  But in
the year 'forty-nine, he is really in possession of the fortune which he and his agents pretended
to be worth ten years before--he is worth a million pounds.  By what means has he come by them?
By railroad contracts, for which he takes care to be paid in hard cash before he attempts to
perform them, and to carry out which he makes use of the sweat and blood of wretches who, since
their organization, have introduced crimes and language into England to which it was previously
almost a stranger--by purchasing, with paper, shares by hundreds in the schemes to execute
which he contracts, and which are his own devising; which shares he sells as soon as they are
at a high premium, to which they are speedily forced by means of paragraphs, inserted by himself
and agents, in newspapers devoted to his interest, utterly reckless of the terrible depreciation
to which they are almost instantly subjected.  But he is worth a million pounds, there can
be no doubt of the fact--he has not made people's fortunes, at least those whose fortunes it
was said he would make; he has made them away; but his own he has made, emphatically made it;
he is worth a million pounds.  Hurrah for the millionnaire!  The clown who views the pandemonium
of red brick which he has built on the estate which he has purchased in the neighbourhood of
the place of his grand debut, in which every species of architecture, Greek, Indian, and Chinese,
is employed in caricature--who hears of the grand entertainment he gives at Christmas in the
principal dining-room, the hundred wax-candles, the waggon-load of plate, and the ocean of
wine which form parts of it, and above all the two ostrich poults, one at the head, and the
other at the foot of the table, exclaims, "Well! if he a'n't bang up, I don't know who be;
why he beats my lord hollow!"  The mechanic of the borough town, who sees him dashing through
the streets in an open landau, drawn by four milk-white horses, amidst his attendant out-riders;
his wife, a monster of a woman, by his side, stout as the wife of Tamerlane, who weighed twenty
stone, and bedizened out like her whose person shone with the jewels of plundered Persia, stares
with silent wonder, and at last exclaims "That's the man for my vote!"  You tell the clown
that the man of the mansion has contributed enormously to corrupt the rural innocence of England;
you point to an incipient branch railroad, from around which the accents of Gomorrah are sounding,
and beg him to listen for a moment, and then close his ears.  Hodge scratches his head and
says, "Well, I have nothing to say to that; all I know is, that he is bang up, and I wish I
were he;" perhaps he will add--a Hodge has been known to add--"He has been kind enough to put
my son on that very railroad; 'tis true the company is somewhat queer, and the work rather
killing, but he gets there half-a-crown a day, whereas from the farmers he would only get eighteen-
pence."  You remind the mechanic that the man in the landau has been the ruin of thousands
and you mention people whom he himself knows, people in various grades of life, widows and
orphans amongst them, whose little all has been dissipated, and whom he has reduced to beggary
by inducing them to become sharers in his delusive schemes.  But the mechanic says, "Well,
the more fools they to let themselves be robbed.  But I don't call that kind of thing robbery,
I merely call it out-witting; and everybody in this free country has a right to outwit others
if he can.  What a turn- out he has!"  One was once heard to add, "I never saw a more genteel-looking
man in all my life except one, and that was a gentleman's walley, who was much like him.  It
is true that he is rather under-sized, but then madam, you know, makes up for all."

CHAPTER V--Subject of Gentility continued.

In the last chapter have been exhibited specimens of gentility, so considered by different
classes; by one class power, youth, and epaulets are considered the ne plus ultra of gentility;
by another class pride, stateliness, and title; by another, wealth and flaming tawdriness.
But what constitutes a gentleman?  It is easy to say at once what constitutes a gentleman,
and there are no distinctions in what is gentlemanly, {5} as there are in what is genteel.
The characteristics of a gentleman are high feeling--a determination never to take a cowardly
advantage of another--a liberal education--absence of narrow views--generosity and courage,
propriety of behaviour.  Now a person may be genteel according to one or another of the three
standards described above, and not possess one of the characteristics of a gentleman.  Is the
emperor a gentleman, with spatters of blood on his clothes, scourged from the backs of noble
Hungarian women?  Are the aristocracy gentlefolks, who admire him?  Is Mr. Flamson a gentleman,
although he has a million pounds?  No! cowardly miscreants, admirers of cowardly miscreants,
and people who make a million pounds by means compared with which those employed to make fortunes
by the getters up of the South Sea Bubble might be called honest dealing, are decidedly not
gentlefolks.  Now as it is clearly demonstrable that a person may be perfectly genteel according
to some standard or other, and yet be no gentleman, so it is demonstrable that a person may
have no pretensions to gentility, and yet be a gentleman.  For example, there is Lavengro!
Would the admirers of the emperor, or the admirers of those who admire the emperor, or the
admirers of Mr. Flamson, call him genteel? and gentility with them is everything!  Assuredly
they would not; and assuredly they would consider him respectively as a being to be shunned,
despised, or hooted.  Genteel!  Why at one time he is a hack author--writes reviewals for eighteenpence
a page--edits a Newgate chronicle.  At another he wanders the country with a face grimy from
occasionally mending kettles; and there is no evidence that his clothes are not seedy and torn,
and his shoes down at the heel; but by what process of reasoning will they prove that he is
no gentleman?  Is he not learned?  Has he not generosity and courage?  Whilst a hack author,
does he pawn the books entrusted to him to review?  Does he break his word to his publisher?
Does he write begging letters?  Does he get clothes or lodgings without paying for them?  Again,
whilst a wanderer, does he insult helpless women on the road with loose proposals or ribald
discourse?  Does he take what is not his own from the hedges?  Does he play on the fiddle,
or make faces in public-houses, in order to obtain pence or beer? or does he call for liquor,
swallow it, and then say to a widowed landlady, "Mistress, I have no brass?"  In a word, what
vice and crime does he perpetrate--what low acts does he commit?  Therefore, with his endowments,
who will venture to say that he is no gentleman?--unless it be an admirer of Mr. Flamson--a
clown--who will, perhaps, shout--"I say he is no gentleman; for who can be a gentleman who
keeps no gig?"

The indifference exhibited by Lavengro for what is merely genteel, compared with his solicitude
never to infringe the strict laws of honour, should read a salutary lesson.  The generality
of his countrymen are far more careful not to transgress the customs of what they call gentility,
than to violate the laws of honour or morality.  They will shrink from carrying their own carpet-bag,
and from speaking to a person in seedy raiment, whilst to matters of much higher importance
they are shamelessly indifferent.  Not so Lavengro; he will do anything that he deems convenient,
or which strikes his fancy, provided it does not outrage decency, or is unallied to profligacy;
is not ashamed to speak to a beggar in rags, and will associate with anybody, provided he can
gratify a laudable curiosity.  He has no abstract love for what is low, or what the world calls
low.  He sees that many things which the world looks down upon are valuable, so he prizes much
which the world condemns; he sees that many things which the world admires are contemptible,
so he despises much which the world does not; but when the world prizes what is really excellent,
he does not contemn it, because the world regards it.  If he learns Irish, which all the world
scoffs at, he likewise learns Italian, which all the world melts at.  If he learns Gypsy, the
language of the tattered tent, he likewise learns Greek, the language of the college-hall.
If he learns smithery, he also learns--ah! what does he learn to set against smithery?--the
law?  No; he does not learn the law, which, by the way, is not very genteel.  Swimming?  Yes,
he learns to swim.  Swimming, however, is not genteel; and the world--at least the genteel
part of it--acts very wisely in setting its face against it; for to swim you must be naked,
and how would many a genteel person look without his clothes?  Come, he learns horsemanship;
a very genteel accomplishment, which every genteel person would gladly possess, though not
all genteel people do.

Again as to associates: if he holds communion when a boy with Murtagh, the scarecrow of an
Irish academy, he associates in after life with Francis Ardry, a rich and talented young Irish
gentleman about town.  If he accepts an invitation from Mr. Petulengro to his tent, he has
no objection to go home with a rich genius to dinner; who then will say that he prizes a thing
or a person because they are ungenteel?  That he is not ready to take up with everything that
is ungenteel he gives a proof, when he refuses, though on the brink of starvation, to become
bonnet to the thimble-man, an office, which, though profitable, is positively ungenteel.  Ah!
but some sticker-up for gentility will exclaim, "The hero did not refuse this office from an
insurmountable dislike to its ungentility, but merely from a feeling of principle."  Well!
the writer is not fond of argument, and he will admit that such was the case; he admits that
it was a love of principle, rather than an over-regard for gentility, which prevented the hero
from accepting, when on the brink of starvation, an ungenteel though lucrative office, an office
which, the writer begs leave to observe, many a person with a great regard for gentility, and
no particular regard for principle, would in a similar strait have accepted; for when did a
mere love for gentility keep a person from being a dirty scoundrel, when the alternatives were
"either be a dirty scoundrel or starve?"  One thing, however, is certain, which is, that Lavengro
did not accept the office, which if a love for what is low had been his ruling passion he certainly
would have done; consequently, he refuses to do one thing which no genteel person would willingly
do, even as he does many things which every genteel person would gladly do, for example, speaks
Italian, rides on horseback, associates with a fashionable young man, dines with a rich genius,
et cetera.  Yet--and it cannot be minced--he and gentility with regard to many things are at
strange divergency; he shrinks from many things at which gentility placidly hums a tune, or
approvingly simpers, and does some things at which gentility positively shrinks.  He will not
run into debt for clothes or lodgings, which he might do without any scandal to gentility;
he will not receive money from Francis Ardry, and go to Brighton with the sister of Annette
Le Noir, though there is nothing ungenteel in borrowing money from a friend, even when you
never intend to repay him, and something poignantly genteel in going to a watering-place with
a gay young Frenchwoman; but he has no objection, after raising twenty pounds by the sale of
that extraordinary work "Joseph Sell," to set off into the country, mend kettles under hedge-rows,
and make pony and donkey shoes in a dingle.  Here, perhaps, some plain, well-meaning person
will cry--and with much apparent justice--how can the writer justify him in this act?  What
motive, save a love for what is low, could induce him to do such a thing?  Would the writer
have everybody who is in need of recreation go into the country, mend kettles under hedges,
and make pony shoes in dingles?  To such an observation the writer would answer, that Lavengro
had an excellent motive in doing what he did, but that the writer is not so unreasonable as
to wish everybody to do the same.  It is not everybody who can mend kettles.  It is not everybody
who is in similar circumstances to those in which Lavengro was.  Lavengro flies from London
and hack authorship, and takes to the roads from fear of consumption; it is expensive to put
up at inns, and even at public- houses, and Lavengro has not much money; so he buys a tinker's
cart and apparatus, and sets up as tinker, and subsequently as blacksmith; a person living
in a tent, or in anything else, must do something or go mad; Lavengro had a mind, as he himself
well knew, with some slight tendency to madness, and had he not employed himself, he must have
gone wild; so to employ himself he drew upon one of his resources, the only one available at
the time.  Authorship had nearly killed him, he was sick of reading, and had besides no books;
but he possessed the rudiments of an art akin to tinkering; he knew something of smithery,
having served a kind of apprenticeship in Ireland to a fairy smith; so he draws upon his smithery
to enable him to acquire tinkering, he speedily acquires that craft, even as he had speedily
acquired Welsh, owing to its connection with Irish, which language he possessed; and with tinkering
he amuses himself until he lays it aside to resume smithery.  A man who has an innocent resource,
has quite as much right to draw upon it in need, as he has upon a banker in whose hands he
has placed a sum; Lavengro turns to advantage, under particular circumstances, a certain resource
which he has, but people who are not so forlorn as Lavengro, and have not served the same apprenticeship
which he had, are not advised to follow his example.  Surely he was better employed in plying
the trades of tinker and smith than in having recourse to vice, in running after milk-maids,
for example.  Running after milk-maids is by no means an ungenteel rural diversion; but let
any one ask some respectable casuist (the Bishop of London for example), whether Lavengro was
not far better employed, when in the country, at tinkering and smithery than he would have
been in running after all the milk-maids in Cheshire, though tinkering is in general considered
a very ungenteel employment, and smithery little better, notwithstanding that an Orcadian poet,
who wrote in Norse about eight hundred years ago, reckons the latter among nine noble arts
which he possessed, naming it along with playing at chess, on the harp, and ravelling runes,
or as the original has it, "treading runes"--that is, compressing them into a small compass
by mingling one letter with another, even as the Turkish caligraphists ravel the Arabic letters,
more especially those who write talismans.

   "Nine arts have I, all noble;
   I play at chess so free,
   At ravelling runes I'm ready,
   At books and smithery;
   I'm skilled o'er ice at skimming
   On skates, I shoot and row,
   And few at harping match me,
   Or minstrelsy, I trow."

But though Lavengro takes up smithery, which, though the Orcadian ranks it with chess-playing
and harping, is certainly somewhat of a grimy art, there can be no doubt that, had he been
wealthy and not so forlorn as he was, he would have turned to many things, honourable, of course,
in preference.  He has no objection to ride a fine horse when he has the opportunity: he has
his day-dream of making a fortune of two hundred thousand pounds by becoming a merchant and
doing business after the Armenian fashion; and there can be no doubt that he would have been
glad to wear fine clothes, provided he had had sufficient funds to authorize him in wearing
them.  For the sake of wandering the country and plying the hammer and tongs, he would not
have refused a commission in the service of that illustrious monarch George the Fourth, provided
he had thought that he could live on his pay, and not be forced to run in debt to tradesmen,
without any hope of paying them, for clothes and luxuries, as many highly genteel officers
in that honourable service were in the habit of doing.  For the sake of tinkering, he would
certainly not have refused a secretaryship of an embassy to Persia, in which he might have
turned his acquaintance with Persian, Arabic, and the Lord only knows what other languages,
to account.  He took to tinkering and smithery, because no better employments were at his command.
No war is waged in the book against rank, wealth, fine clothes, or dignified employments; it
is shown, however, that a person may be a gentleman and a scholar without them.  Rank, wealth,
fine clothes, and dignified employments, are no doubt very fine things, but they are merely
externals, they do not make a gentleman, they add external grace and dignity to the gentleman
and scholar, but they make neither; and is it not better to be a gentleman without them than
not a gentleman with them?  Is not Lavengro, when he leaves London on foot with twenty pounds
in his pocket, entitled to more respect than Mr. Flamson flaming in his coach with a million?
And is not even the honest jockey at Horncastle, who offers a fair price to Lavengro for his
horse, entitled to more than the scoundrel lord, who attempts to cheat him of one-fourth of
its value?

Millions, however, seem to think otherwise, by their servile adoration of people whom without
rank, wealth, and fine clothes they would consider infamous, but whom possessed of rank, wealth,
and glittering habiliments they seem to admire all the more for their profligacy and crimes.
Does not a blood-spot, or a lust-spot, on the clothes of a blooming emperor, give a kind of
zest to the genteel young god?  Do not the pride, superciliousness, and selfishness of a certain
aristocracy make it all the more regarded by its worshippers? and do not the clownish and gutter-
blood admirers of Mr. Flamson like him all the more because they are conscious that he is a
knave?  If such is the case --and, alas! is it not the case?--they cannot be too frequently
told that fine clothes, wealth, and titles adorn a person in proportion as he adorns them;
that if worn by the magnanimous and good they are ornaments indeed, but if by the vile and
profligate they are merely san benitos, and only serve to make their infamy doubly apparent;
and that a person in seedy raiment and tattered hat, possessed of courage, kindness, and virtue,
is entitled to more respect from those to whom his virtues are manifested than any cruel profligate
emperor, selfish aristocrat, or knavish millionaire in the world.

The writer has no intention of saying that all in England are affected with the absurd mania
for gentility; nor is such a statement made in the book; it is shown therein that individuals
of certain classes can prize a gentleman, notwithstanding seedy raiment, dusty shoes or tattered
hat,--for example, the young Irishman, the rich genius, the postillion, and his employer. 
Again, when the life of the hero is given to the world, amidst the howl about its lowness and
vulgarity, raised by the servile crew whom its independence of sentiment has stung, more than
one powerful voice has been heard testifying approbation of its learning and the purity of
its morality.  That there is some salt in England, minds not swayed by mere externals, he is
fully convinced; if he were not, he would spare himself the trouble of writing; but to the
fact that the generality of his countrymen are basely grovelling before the shrine of what
they are pleased to call gentility, he cannot shut his eyes.

Oh! what a clever person that Cockney was, who, travelling in the Aberdeen railroad carriage,
after edifying the company with his remarks on various subjects, gave it as his opinion that
Lieutenant P--- would, in future, be shunned by all respectable society!  And what a simple
person that elderly gentleman was, who, abruptly starting, asked in rather an authoritative
voice, "and why should Lieutenant P--- be shunned by respectable society?" and who, after entering
into what was said to be a masterly analysis of the entire evidence of the case, concluded
by stating, "that having been accustomed to all kinds of evidence all his life, he had never
known a case in which the accused had obtained a more complete and triumphant justification
than Lieutenant P--- had done in the late trial."

Now the Cockney, who is said to have been a very foppish Cockney, was perfectly right in what
he said, and therein manifested a knowledge of the English mind and character, and likewise
of the modern English language, to which his catechist, who, it seems, was a distinguished
member of the Scottish bar, could lay no pretensions.  The Cockney knew what the Lord of Session
knew not, that the British public is gentility crazy, and he knew, moreover, that gentility
and respectability are synonymous.  No one in England is genteel or respectable that is "looked
at," who is the victim of oppression; he may be pitied for a time, but when did not pity terminate
in contempt?  A poor, harmless young officer--but why enter into the details of the infamous
case? they are but too well known, and if ever cruelty, pride, and cowardice, and things much
worse than even cruelty, cowardice, and pride were brought to light, and, at the same time,
countenanced, they were in that case.  What availed the triumphant justification of the poor
victim?  There was at first a roar of indignation against his oppressors, but how long did
it last?  He had been turned out of the service, they remained in it with their red coats and
epaulets; he was merely the son of a man who had rendered good service to his country, they
were, for the most part, highly connected--they were in the extremest degree genteel, he quite
the reverse; so the nation wavered, considered, thought the genteel side was the safest after
all, and then with the cry of, "Oh! there is nothing like gentility," ratted bodily.  Newspaper
and public turned against the victim, scouted him, apologized for the--what should they be
called?--who were not only admitted into the most respectable society, but courted to come,
the spots not merely of wine on their military clothes, giving them a kind of poignancy.  But
there is a God in heaven; the British glories are tarnished--Providence has never smiled on
British arms since that case--oh!  Balaklava! thy name interpreted is net of fishes, and well
dost thou deserve that name.  How many a scarlet golden fish has of late perished in the mud
amidst thee, cursing the genteel service, and the genteel leader which brought him to such a doom.

Whether the rage for gentility is most prevalent amongst the upper, middle, or lower classes
it is difficult to say; the priest in the text seems to think that it is exhibited in the most
decided manner in the middle class; it is the writer's opinion, however, that in no class is
it more strongly developed than in the lower: what they call being well-born goes a great way
amongst them, but the possession of money much farther, whence Mr. Flamson's influence over
them.  Their rage against, and scorn for, any person who by his courage and talents has advanced
himself in life, and still remains poor, are indescribable; "he is no better than ourselves,"
they say, "why should he be above us?"--for they have no conception that anybody has a right
to ascendency over themselves except by birth or money.  This feeling amongst the vulgar has
been, to a certain extent, the bane of two services, naval and military.  The writer does not
make this assertion rashly; he observed this feeling at work in the army when a child, and
he has good reason for believing that it was as strongly at work in the navy at the same time,
and is still as prevalent in both.  Why are not brave men raised from the ranks? is frequently
the cry; why are not brave sailors promoted?  The Lord help brave soldiers and sailors who
are promoted; they have less to undergo from the high airs of their brother officers, and those
are hard enough to endure, than from the insolence of the men.  Soldiers and sailors promoted
to command are said to be in general tyrants; in nine cases out of ten, when they are tyrants,
they have been obliged to have recourse to extreme severity in order to protect themselves
from the insolence and mutinous spirit of the men,--"He is no better than ourselves: shoot
him, bayonet him, or fling him overboard!" they say of some obnoxious individual raised above
them by his merit.  Soldiers and sailors, in general, will bear any amount of tyranny from
a lordly sot, or the son of a man who has "plenty of brass"--their own term--but will mutiny
against the just orders of a skilful and brave officer who "is no better than themselves."
There was the affair of the "Bounty," for example: Bligh was one of the best seamen that ever
trod deck, and one of the bravest of men; proofs of his seamanship he gave by steering, amidst
dreadful weather, a deeply-laden boat for nearly four thousand miles over an almost unknown
ocean--of his bravery, at the fight of Copenhagen, one of the most desperate ever fought, of
which after Nelson he was the hero: he was, moreover, not an unkind man; but the crew of the
"Bounty" mutinied against him, and set him half naked in an open boat, with certain of his
men who remained faithful to him, and ran away with the ship.  Their principal motive for doing
so was an idea, whether true or groundless the writer cannot say, that Bligh was "no better
than themselves;" he was certainly neither a lord's illegitimate, nor possessed of twenty thousand
pounds.  The writer knows what he is writing about, having been acquainted in his early years
with an individual who was turned adrift with Bligh, and who died about the year '22, a lieutenant
in the navy, in a provincial town in which the writer was brought up.  The ringleaders in the
mutiny were two scoundrels, Christian and Young, who had great influence with the crew, because
they were genteelly connected.  Bligh, after leaving the "Bounty," had considerable difficulty
in managing the men who had shared his fate, because they considered themselves "as good men
as he," notwithstanding, that to his conduct and seamanship they had alone to look, under Heaven,
for salvation from the ghastly perils that surrounded them.  Bligh himself, in his journal,
alludes to this feeling. Once, when he and his companions landed on a desert island, one of
them said, with a mutinous look, that he considered himself "as good a man as he;" Bligh, seizing
a cutlass, called upon him to take another and defend himself, whereupon the man said that
Bligh was going to kill him, and made all manner of concessions; now why did this fellow consider
himself as good a man as Bligh?  Was he as good a seaman? no, nor a tenth part as good.  As
brave a man? no, nor a tenth part as brave; and of these facts he was perfectly well aware,
but bravery and seamanship stood for nothing with him, as they still stand with thousands of
his class; Bligh was not genteel by birth or money, therefore Bligh was no better than himself.
Had Bligh, before he sailed, got a twenty-thousand pound prize in the lottery, he would have
experienced no insolence from this fellow, for there would have been no mutiny in the "Bounty."
"He is our betters," the crew would have said, "and it is our duty to obey him."

The wonderful power of gentility in England is exemplified in nothing more than in what it
is producing amongst Jews, Gypsies, and Quakers.  It is breaking up their venerable communities.
All the better, some one will say.  Alas! alas!  It is making the wealthy Jews forsake the
synagogue for the opera-house, or the gentility chapel, in which a disciple of Mr. Platitude,
in a white surplice, preaches a sermon at noon- day from a desk, on each side of which is a
flaming taper.  It is making them abandon their ancient literature, their "Mischna," their
"Gemara," their "Zohar," for gentility novels, "The Young Duke," the most unexceptionably genteel
book ever written, being the principal favourite. It makes the young Jew ashamed of the young
Jewess, it makes her ashamed of the young Jew.  The young Jew marries an opera-dancer, or if
the dancer will not have him, as is frequently the case, the cast-off Miss of the Honourable
Spencer So-and-so.  It makes the young Jewess accept the honourable offer of a cashiered lieutenant
of the Bengal Native Infantry; or, if such a person does not come forward, the dishonourable
offer of a cornet of a regiment of crack hussars.  It makes poor Jews, male and female, forsake
the synagogue for the sixpenny theatre or penny hop; the Jew to take up with an Irish female
of loose character, and the Jewess with a musician of the Guards, or the Tipperary servant
of Captain Mulligan.  With respect to the gypsies, it is making the women what they never were
before--harlots; and the men what they never were before--careless fathers and husbands.  It
has made the daughter of Ursula the chaste take up with the base drummer of a wild-beast show.
It makes Gorgiko Brown, the gypsy man, leave his tent and his old wife, of an evening, and
thrust himself into society which could well dispense with him.  "Brother," said Mr. Petulengro
to the Romany Rye, after telling him many things connected with the decadence of gypsyism,
"there is one Gorgiko Brown, who, with a face as black as a tea-kettle, wishes to be mistaken
for a Christian tradesman; he goes into the parlour of a third-rate inn of an evening, calls
for rum and water, and attempts to enter into conversation with the company about politics
and business; the company flout him and give him the cold shoulder, or perhaps complain to
the landlord, who comes and asks him what business he has in the parlour, telling him if he
wants to drink to go into the tap-room, and perhaps collars him and kicks him out, provided
he refuses to move."  With respect to the Quakers, it makes the young people like the young
Jews, crazy after gentility diversions, worship, marriages, or connections, and makes old Pease
do what it makes Gorgiko Brown do, thrust himself into society which could well dispense with
him, and out of which he is not kicked, because unlike the gypsy he is not poor.  The writer
would say much more on these points, but want of room prevents him; he must therefore request
the reader to have patience until he can lay before the world a pamphlet, which he has been
long meditating, to be entitled "Remarks on the strikingly similar Effects which a Love for
Gentility has produced, and is producing, amongst Jews, Gypsies, and Quakers."

The Priest in the book has much to say on the subject of this gentility- nonsense; no person
can possibly despise it more thoroughly than that very remarkable individual seems to do, yet
he hails its prevalence with pleasure, knowing the benefits which will result from it to the
church of which he is the sneering slave.  "The English are mad after gentility," says he;
"well, all the better for us; their religion for a long time past has been a plain and simple
one, and consequently by no means genteel; they'll quit it for ours, which is the perfection
of what they admire; with which Templars, Hospitalers, mitred abbots, Gothic abbeys, long-drawn
aisles, golden censers, incense, et cetera, are connected; nothing, or next to nothing, of
Christ, it is true, but weighed in the balance against gentility, where will Christianity be?
why, kicking against the beam--ho! ho!"  And in connection with the gentility-nonsense, he
expatiates largely, and with much contempt, on a species of literature by which the interests
of his church in England have been very much advanced--all genuine priests have a thorough
contempt for everything which tends to advance the interests of their church--this literature
is made up of pseudo Jacobitism, Charlie o'er the waterism, or nonsense about Charlie o'er
the water.  And the writer will now take the liberty of saying a few words about it on his
own account.

CHAPTER VI--On Scotch Gentility-Nonsense--Charlie o'er the Waterism.

Of the literature just alluded to Scott was the inventor.  It is founded on the fortunes and
misfortunes of the Stuart family, of which Scott was the zealous defender and apologist, doing
all that in his power lay to represent the members of it as noble, chivalrous, high-minded,
unfortunate princes; though, perhaps, of all the royal families that ever existed upon the
earth, this family was the worst.  It was unfortunate enough, it is true; but it owed its misfortunes
entirely to its crimes, viciousness, bad faith, and cowardice.  Nothing will be said of it
here until it made its appearance in England to occupy the English throne.

The first of the family which we have to do with, James, was a dirty, cowardly miscreant, of
whom the less said the better.  His son, Charles the First, was a tyrant--exceedingly cruel
and revengeful, but weak and dastardly; he caused a poor fellow to be hanged in London, who
was not his subject, because he had heard that the unfortunate creature had once bitten his
own glove at Cadiz, in Spain, at the mention of his name; and he permitted his own bull-dog,
Strafford, to be executed by his own enemies, though the only crime of Strafford was, that
he had barked furiously at those enemies, and had worried two or three of them, when Charles
shouted, "Fetch 'em."  He was a bitter, but yet a despicable enemy, and the coldest and most
worthless of friends; for though he always hoped to be able, some time or other, to hang his
enemies, he was always ready to curry favour with them, more especially if he could do so at
the expense of his friends.  He was the haughtiest, yet meanest of mankind.  He once caned
a young nobleman for appearing before him in the drawing-room not dressed exactly according
to the court etiquette; yet he condescended to flatter and compliment him who, from principle,
was his bitterest enemy, namely, Harrison, when the republican colonel was conducting him as
a prisoner to London.  His bad faith was notorious; it was from abhorrence of the first public
instance which he gave of his bad faith, his breaking his word to the Infanta of Spain, that
the poor Hiberno-Spaniard bit his glove at Cadiz; and it was his notorious bad faith which
eventually cost him his head; for the Republicans would gladly have spared him, provided they
could put the slightest confidence in any promise, however solemn, which he might have made
to them.  Of them, it would be difficult to say whether they most hated or despised him.  Religion
he had none.  One day he favoured Popery; the next, on hearing certain clamours of the people,
he sent his wife's domestics back packing to France, because they were Papists.  Papists, however,
should make him a saint, for he was certainly the cause of the taking of Rochelle.

His son, Charles the Second, though he passed his youth in the school of adversity, learned
no other lesson from it than the following one--take care of yourself, and never do an action,
either good or bad, which is likely to bring you into any great difficulty; and this maxim
he acted up to as soon as he came to the throne.  He was a Papist, but took especial care not
to acknowledge his religion, at which he frequently scoffed, till just before his last gasp,
when he knew that he could lose nothing, and hoped to gain everything by it.  He was always
in want of money, but took care not to tax the country beyond all endurable bounds; preferring
to such a bold and dangerous course, to become the pensioner of Louis, to whom, in return for
his gold, he sacrificed the honour and interests of Britain.  He was too lazy and sensual to
delight in playing the part of a tyrant himself; but he never checked tyranny in others save
in one instance.  He permitted beastly butchers to commit unmentionable horrors on the feeble,
unarmed, and disunited Covenanters of Scotland, but checked them when they would fain have
endeavoured to play the same game on the numerous united, dogged, and warlike Independents
of England.  To show his filial piety, he bade the hangman dishonour the corpses of some of
his father's judges, before whom, when alive, he ran like a screaming hare; but permitted those
who had lost their all in supporting his father's cause, to pine in misery and want.  He would
give to a painted harlot a thousand pounds for a loathsome embrace, and to a player or buffoon
a hundred for a trumpery pun, but would refuse a penny to the widow or orphan of an old Royalist
soldier.  He was the personification of selfishness; and as he loved and cared for no one,
so did no one love or care for him.  So little had he gained the respect or affection of those
who surrounded him, that after his body had undergone an after-death examination, parts of
it were thrown down the sinks of the palace, to become eventually the prey of the swine and
ducks of Westminster.

His brother, who succeeded him, James the Second, was a Papist, but sufficiently honest to
acknowledge his Popery, but upon the whole, he was a poor creature; though a tyrant, he was
cowardly, had he not been a coward he would never have lost his throne.  There were plenty
of lovers of tyranny in England who would have stood by him, provided he would have stood by
them, and would, though not Papists, have encouraged him in his attempt to bring back England
beneath the sway of Rome, and perhaps would eventually have become Papists themselves; but
the nation raising a cry against him, and his son-in-law, the Prince of Orange, invading the
country, he forsook his friends, of whom he had a host, but for whom he cared little--left
his throne, for which he cared a great deal--and Popery in England, for which he cared yet
more, to their fate, and escaped to France, from whence, after taking a little heart, he repaired
to Ireland, where he was speedily joined by a gallant army of Papists whom he basely abandoned
at the Boyne, running away in a most lamentable condition, at the time when by showing a little
courage he might have enabled them to conquer.  This worthy, in his last will, bequeathed his
heart to England--his right arm to Scotland--and his bowels to Ireland. What the English and
Scotch said to their respective bequests is not known, but it is certain that an old Irish
priest, supposed to have been a great-grand-uncle of the present Reverend Father Murtagh, on
hearing of the bequest to Ireland, fell into a great passion, and having been brought up at
"Paris and Salamanca," expressed his indignation in the following strain:--"Malditas sean tus
tripas! teniamos bastante del olor de tus tripas al tiempo de tu nuida dela batalla del Boyne!"

His son, generally called the Old Pretender, though born in England, was carried in his infancy
to France, where he was brought up in the strictest principles of Popery, which principles,
however, did not prevent him becoming (when did they ever prevent any one?) a worthless and
profligate scoundrel; there are some doubts as to the reality of his being a son of James,
which doubts are probably unfounded, the grand proof of his legitimacy being the thorough baseness
of his character.  It was said of his father that he could speak well, and it may be said of
him that he could write well, the only thing he could do which was worth doing, always supposing
that there is any merit in being able to write. He was of a mean appearance, and, like his
father, pusillanimous to a degree.  The meanness of his appearance disgusted, and his pusillanimity
discouraged the Scotch when he made his appearance amongst them in the year 1715, some time
after the standard of rebellion had been hoisted by Mar.  He only stayed a short time in Scotland,
and then, seized with panic, retreated to France, leaving his friends to shift for themselves
as they best could.  He died a pensioner of the Pope.

The son of this man, Charles Edward, of whom so much in later years has been said and written,
was a worthless ignorant youth, and a profligate and illiterate old man.  When young, the best
that can be said of him is, that he had occasionally springs of courage, invariably at the
wrong time and place, which merely served to lead his friends into inextricable difficulties.
When old, he was loathsome and contemptible to both friend and foe.  His wife loathed him,
and for the most terrible of reasons; she did not pollute his couch, for to do that was impossible--he
had made it so vile; but she betrayed it, inviting to it not only Alfieri the Filthy, but the
coarsest grooms.  Doctor King, the warmest and almost last adherent of his family, said, that
there was not a vice or crime of which he was not guilty; as for his foes, they scorned to
harm him even when in their power.  In the year 1745 he came down from the Highlands of Scotland,
which had long been a focus of rebellion.  He was attended by certain clans of the Highlands,
desperadoes used to free-bootery from their infancy, and, consequently, to the use of arms,
and possessed of a certain species of discipline; with these he defeated at Prestonpans a body
of men called soldiers, but who were in reality peasants and artizans, levied about a month
before, without discipline or confidence in each other, and who were miserably massacred by
the Highland army; he subsequently invaded England, nearly destitute of regular soldiers, and
penetrated as far as Derby, from which place he retreated on learning that regular forces which
had been hastily recalled from Flanders were coming against him, with the Duke of Cumberland
at their head; he was pursued, and his rearguard overtaken and defeated by the dragoons of
the duke at Clifton, from which place the rebels retreated in great confusion across the Eden
into Scotland, where they commenced dancing Highland reels and strathspeys on the bank of the
river, for joy at their escape, whilst a number of wretched girls, paramours of some of them,
were perishing in the waters of the swollen river in an attempt to follow them; they themselves
passed over by eighties and by hundreds, arm in arm, for mutual safety, without the loss of
a man, but they left the poor paramours to shift for themselves, nor did any of these canny
people after passing the stream dash back to rescue a single female life,--no, they were too
well employed upon the bank in dancing strathspeys to the tune of "Charlie o'er the water."
It was, indeed, Charlie o'er the water, and canny Highlanders o'er the water, but where were
the poor prostitutes meantime?  In the water.

The Jacobite farce, or tragedy, was speedily brought to a close by the battle of Culloden;
there did Charlie wish himself back again o'er the water, exhibiting the most unmistakable
signs of pusillanimity; there were the clans cut to pieces, at least those who could be brought
to the charge, and there fell Giles Mac Bean, or as he was called in Gaelic, Giliosa Mac Beathan,
a kind of giant, six feet four inches and a quarter high, "than whom," as his wife said in
a coronach she made upon him, "no man who stood at Cuiloitr was taller"--Giles Mac Bean the
Major of the clan Cattan--a great drinker--a great fisher--a great shooter, and the champion
of the Highland host.

The last of the Stuarts was a cardinal.

Such were the Stuarts, such their miserable history.  They were dead and buried in every sense
of the word until Scott resuscitated them--how? by the power of fine writing and by calling
to his aid that strange divinity, gentility.  He wrote splendid novels about the Stuarts, in
which he represents them as unlike what they really were as the graceful and beautiful papillon
is unlike the hideous and filthy worm.  In a word, he made them genteel, and that was enough
to give them paramount sway over the minds of the British people.  The public became Stuart-mad,
and everybody, specially the women, said, "What a pity it was that we hadn't a Stuart to govern."
All parties, Whig, Tory, or Radical, became Jacobite at heart, and admirers of absolute power.
The Whigs talked about the liberty of the subject, and the Radicals about the rights of man
still, but neither party cared a straw for what it talked about, and mentally swore that, as
soon as by means of such stuff they could get places, and fill their pockets, they would be
as Jacobite as the Jacobs themselves.  As for Tories, no great change in them was necessary;
everything favouring absolutism and slavery being congenial to them.  So the whole nation,
that is, the reading part of the nation, with some exceptions, for thank God there has always
been some salt in England, went over the water to Charlie.  But going over to Charlie was not
enough, they must, or at least a considerable part of them, go over to Rome too, or have a
hankering to do so.  As the Priest sarcastically observes in the text, "As all the Jacobs were
Papists, so the good folks who through Scott's novels admire the Jacobs must be Papists too."
An idea got about that the religion of such genteel people as the Stuarts must be the climax
of gentility, and that idea was quite sufficient.  Only let a thing, whether temporal or spiritual,
be considered genteel in England, and if it be not followed it is strange indeed; so Scott's
writings not only made the greater part of the nation Jacobite, but Popish.

Here some people will exclaim--whose opinions remain sound and uncontaminated--what you say
is perhaps true with respect to the Jacobite nonsense at present so prevalent being derived
from Scott's novels, but the Popish nonsense, which people of the genteeler classes are so
fond of, is derived from Oxford.  We sent our sons to Oxford nice honest lads, educated in
the principles of the Church of England, and at the end of the first term they came home puppies,
talking Popish nonsense, which they had learned from the pedants to whose care we had entrusted
them; ay, not only Popery but Jacobitism, which they hardly carried with them from home, for
we never heard them talking Jacobitism before they had been at Oxford; but now their conversation
is a farrago of Popish and Jacobite stuff--"Complines and Claverse."  Now, what these honest
folks say is, to a certain extent, founded on fact; the Popery which has overflowed the land
during the last fourteen or fifteen years, has come immediately from Oxford, and likewise some
of the Jacobitism, Popish and Jacobite nonsense, and little or nothing else, having been taught
at Oxford for about that number of years.  But whence did the pedants get the Popish nonsense
with which they have corrupted youth?  Why, from the same quarter from which they got the Jacobite
nonsense with which they have inoculated those lads who were not inoculated with it before--Scott's
novels.  Jacobitism and Laudism, a kind of half Popery, had at one time been very prevalent
at Oxford, but both had been long consigned to oblivion there, and people at Oxford cared as
little about Laud as they did about the Pretender.  Both were dead and buried there, as everywhere
else, till Scott called them out of their graves, when the pedants of Oxford hailed both--ay,
and the Pope, too, as soon as Scott had made the old fellow fascinating, through particular
novels, more especially the "Monastery" and "Abbot."  Then the quiet, respectable, honourable
Church of England would no longer do for the pedants of Oxford; they must belong to a more
genteel church--they were ashamed at first to be downright Romans--so they would be Lauds.
The pale-looking, but exceedingly genteel non-juring clergyman in Waverley was a Laud; but
they soon became tired of being Lauds, for Laud's Church, gew-gawish and idolatrous as it was,
was not sufficiently tinselly and idolatrous for them, so they must be Popes, but in a sneaking
way, still calling themselves Church-of-England men, in order to batten on the bounty of the
church which they were betraying, and likewise have opportunities of corrupting such lads as
might still resort to Oxford with principles uncontaminated.

So the respectable people, whose opinions are still sound, are, to a certain extent, right
when they say that the tide of Popery, which has flowed over the land, has come from Oxford.
It did come immediately from Oxford, but how did it get to Oxford?  Why, from Scott's novels.
Oh! that sermon which was the first manifestation of Oxford feeling, preached at Oxford some
time in the year '38 by a divine of a weak and confused intellect, in which Popery was mixed
up with Jacobitism!  The present writer remembers perfectly well, on reading some extracts
from it at the time in a newspaper, on the top of a coach, exclaiming--"Why, the simpleton
has been pilfering from Walter Scott's novels!"

O Oxford pedants!  Oxford pedants! ye whose politics and religion are both derived from Scott's
novels! what a pity it is that some lad of honest parents, whose mind ye are endeavouring to
stultify with your nonsense about "Complines and Claverse," has not the spirit to start up
and cry, "Confound your gibberish!  I'll have none of it.  Hurrah for the Church, and the principles
of my father!"

CHAPTER VII--Same Subject continued.

Now what could have induced Scott to write novels tending to make people Papists and Jacobites,
and in love with arbitrary power?  Did he think that Christianity was a gaudy mummery?  He
did not, he could not, for he had read the Bible; yet was he fond of gaudy mummeries, fond
of talking about them.  Did he believe that the Stuarts were a good family, and fit to govern
a country like Britain?  He knew that they were a vicious, worthless crew, and that Britain
was a degraded country as long as they swayed the sceptre; but for those facts he cared nothing,
they governed in a way which he liked, for he had an abstract love of despotism, and an abhorrence
of everything savouring of freedom and the rights of man in general.  His favourite political
picture was a joking, profligate, careless king, nominally absolute--the heads of great houses
paying court to, but in reality governing, that king, whilst revelling with him on the plunder
of a nation, and a set of crouching, grovelling vassals (the literal meaning of vassal is a
wretch), who, after allowing themselves to be horsewhipped, would take a bone if flung to them,
and be grateful; so that in love with mummery, though he knew what Christianity was, no wonder
he admired such a church as that of Rome, and that which Laud set up; and by nature formed
to be the holder of the candle to ancient worm- eaten and profligate families, no wonder that
all his sympathies were with the Stuarts and their dissipated insolent party, and all his hatred
directed against those who endeavoured to check them in their proceedings, and to raise the
generality of mankind something above a state of vassalage, that is, wretchedness.  Those who
were born great, were, if he could have had his will, always to remain great, however worthless
their characters.  Those who were born low, were always to remain so, however great their talents;
though, if that rule were carried out, where would he have been himself?

In the book which he called the "History of Napoleon Bonaparte," in which he plays the sycophant
to all the legitimate crowned heads in Europe, whatever their crimes, vices, or miserable imbecilities,
he, in his abhorrence of everything low which by its own vigour makes itself illustrious, calls
Murat of the sabre the son of a pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise pastry-cook.  It is a pity that
people who give themselves hoity-toity airs--and the Scotch in general are wonderfully addicted
to giving themselves hoity-toity airs, and checking people better than themselves with their
birth {6} and their country--it is a great pity that such people do not look at home-son of
a pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise pastry-cook!  Well, and what was Scott himself?  Why, son
of a pettifogger, of an Edinburgh pettifogger.  "Oh, but Scott was descended from the old cow-stealers
of Buccleuch, and therefore--" descended from old cow-stealers, was he?  Well, had he nothing
to boast of beyond such a pedigree, he would have lived and died the son of a pettifogger,
and been forgotten, and deservedly so; but he possessed talents, and by his talents rose like
Murat, and like him will be remembered for his talents alone, and deservedly so.  "Yes, but
Murat was still the son of a pastry- cook, and though he was certainly good at the sabre, and
cut his way to a throne, still--"  Lord! what fools there are in the world; but as no one can
be thought anything of in this world without a pedigree, the writer will now give a pedigree
for Murat, of a very different character from the cow-stealing one of Scott, but such a one
as the proudest he might not disdain to claim.  Scott was descended from the old cow-stealers
of Buccleuch--was he?  Good! and Murat was descended from the old Moors of Spain, from the
Abencerages (sons of the saddle) of Granada.  The name Murat is Arabic, and is the same as
Murad (Le Desire, or the wished-for one).  Scott in his genteel Life of Bonaparte, says that
"when Murat was in Egypt, the similarity between the name of the celebrated Mameluke Mourad
and that of Bonaparte's Meilleur Sabreur was remarked, and became the subject of jest amongst
the comrades of the gallant Frenchman."  But the writer of the novel of Bonaparte did not know
that the names were one and the same.  Now which was the best pedigree, that of the son of
the pastry-cook, or that of the son of the pettifogger?  Which was the best blood?  Let us
observe the workings of the two bloods.  He who had the blood of the "sons of the saddle" in
him, became the wonderful cavalier of the most wonderful host that ever went forth to conquest,
won for himself a crown, and died the death of a soldier, leaving behind him a son, only inferior
to himself in strength, in prowess, and in horsemanship.  The descendant of the cow-stealer
became a poet, a novel writer, the panegyrist of great folk and genteel people; became insolvent
because, though an author, he deemed it ungenteel to be mixed up with the business part of
the authorship; died paralytic and broken-hearted because he could no longer give entertainments
to great folks, leaving behind him, amongst other children, who were never heard of, a son,
who, through his father's interest, had become lieutenant-colonel in a genteel cavalry regiment.
A son who was ashamed of his father because his father was an author; a son who--paugh--why
ask which was the best blood?

So, owing to his rage for gentility, Scott must needs become the apologist of the Stuarts and
their party; but God made this man pay dearly for taking the part of the wicked against the
good; for lauding up to the skies the miscreants and robbers, and calumniating the noble spirits
of Britain, the salt of England, and his own country.  As God had driven the Stuarts from their
throne, and their followers from their estates, making them vagabonds and beggars on the face
of the earth, taking from them all that they cared for, so did that same God, who knows perfectly
well how and where to strike, deprive the apologist of that wretched crew of all that rendered
life pleasant in his eyes, the lack of which paralysed him in body and mind, rendered him pitiable
to others, loathsome to himself,--so much so, that he once said, "Where is the beggar who would
change places with me, notwithstanding all my fame?"  Ah! God knows perfectly well how to strike.
He permitted him to retain all his literary fame to the very last--his literary fame for which
he cared nothing; but what became of the sweetness of life, his fine house, his grand company,
and his entertainments?  The grand house ceased to be his; he was only permitted to live in
it on sufferance, and whatever grandeur it might still retain, it soon became as desolate a
looking house as any misanthrope could wish to see--where were the grand entertainments and
the grand company? there are no grand entertainments where there is no money; no lords and
ladies where there are no entertainments--and there lay the poor lodger in the desolate house,
groaning on a bed no longer his, smitten by the hand of God in the part where he was most vulnerable.
Of what use telling such a man to take comfort, for he had written the "Minstrel" and "Rob
Roy,"--telling him to think of his literary fame? Literary fame, indeed! he wanted back his
lost gentility:--

   "Retain my altar,
   I care nothing for it--but, oh! touch not my beard."

   PORNY'S War of the Gods.

He dies, his children die too, and then comes the crowning judgment of God on what remains
of his race and the house which he had built.  He was not a Papist himself, nor did he wish
any one belonging to him to be Popish, for he had read enough of the Bible to know that no
one can be saved through Popery, yet had he a sneaking affection for it, and would at times
in an underhand manner, give it a good word both in writing and discourse, because it was a
gaudy kind of worship, and ignorance and vassalage prevailed so long as it flourished--but
he certainly did not wish any of his people to become Papists, nor the house which he had built
to become a Popish house, though the very name he gave it savoured of Popery; but Popery becomes
fashionable through his novels and poems--the only one that remains of his race, a female grandchild,
marries a person who, following the fashion, becomes a Papist, and makes her a Papist too.
Money abounds with the husband, who buys the house, and then the house becomes the rankest
Popish house in Britain.  A superstitious person might almost imagine that one of the old Scottish
Covenanters, whilst the grand house was being built from the profits resulting from the sale
of writings favouring Popery and persecution, and calumniatory of Scotland's saints and martyrs,
had risen from the grave, and banned Scott, his race, and his house, by reading a certain psalm.

In saying what he has said about Scott, the author has not been influenced by any feeling of
malice or ill-will, but simply by a regard for truth, and a desire to point out to his countrymen
the harm which has resulted from the perusal of his works;--he is not one of those who would
depreciate the talents of Scott--he admires his talents, both as a prose writer and a poet;
as a poet especially he admires him, and believes him to have been by far the greatest, with
perhaps the exception of Mickiewicz, who only wrote for unfortunate Poland, that Europe has
given birth to during the last hundred years.  As a prose writer he admires him, less, it is
true, but his admiration for him in that capacity is very high, and he only laments that he
prostituted his talents to the cause of the Stuarts and gentility.  What book of fiction of
the present century can you read twice, with the exception of "Waverley" and "Rob Roy?"  There
is "Pelham," it is true, which the writer of these lines has seen a Jewess reading in the steppe
of Debreczin, and which a young Prussian Baron, a great traveller, whom he met at Constantinople
in '44 told him he always carried in his valise.  And, in conclusion, he will say, in order
to show the opinion which he entertains of the power of Scott as a writer, that he did for
the sceptre of the wretched Pretender what all the kings of Europe could not do for his body--placed
it on the throne of these realms; and for Popery, what Popes and Cardinals strove in vain to
do for three centuries--brought back its mummeries and nonsense into the temples of the British
Isles.

Scott during his lifetime had a crowd of imitators, who, whether they wrote history so called--poetry
so called--or novels--nobody would call a book a novel if he could call it anything else--wrote
Charlie o'er the water nonsense; and now that he has been dead nearly a quarter of a century,
there are others daily springing up who are striving to imitate Scott in his Charlie o'er the
water nonsense--for nonsense it is, even when flowing from his pen.  They, too, must write
Jacobite histories, Jacobite songs, and Jacobite novels, and much the same figure as the scoundrel
menials in the comedy cut when personating their masters, and retailing their masters' conversation,
do they cut as Walter Scotts.  In their histories, they too talk about the Prince and Glenfinnan,
and the pibroch; and in their songs about "Claverse" and "Bonny Dundee."  But though they may
be Scots, they are not Walter Scotts.  But it is perhaps chiefly in the novel that you see
the veritable hog in armour; the time of the novel is of course the '15 or '45; the hero a
Jacobite, and connected with one or other of the enterprises of those periods; and the author,
to show how unprejudiced he is, and what original views he takes of subjects, must needs speak
up for Popery, whenever he has occasion to mention it; though, with all his originality, when
he brings his hero and the vagabonds with which he is concerned before a barricadoed house,
belonging to the Whigs, he can make them get into it by no other method than that which Scott
makes his rioters employ to get into the Tolbooth, burning down the door.

To express the more than utter foolishness of this latter Charlie o'er the water nonsense,
whether in rhyme or prose, there is but one word, and that word a Scotch word.  Scotch, the
sorriest of jargons, compared with which even Roth Welsch is dignified and expressive, has
yet one word to express what would be inexpressible by any word or combination of words in
any language, or in any other jargon in the world; and very properly; for as the nonsense is
properly Scotch, so should the word be Scotch which expresses it--that word is "fushionless,"
pronounced fooshionless; and when the writer has called the nonsense fooshionless--and he does
call it fooshionless--he has nothing more to say, but leaves the nonsense to its fate.

CHAPTER VIII--On Canting Nonsense.

The writer now wishes to say something on the subject of canting nonsense, of which there is
a great deal in England.  There are various cants in England, amongst which is the religious
cant.  He is not going to discuss the subject of religious cant: lest, however, he should be
misunderstood, he begs leave to repeat that he is a sincere member of the Church of England,
in which he believes there is more religion, and consequently less cant, than in any other
church in the world; nor is he going to discuss many other cants; he shall content himself
with saying something about two--the temperance cant and the unmanly cant.  Temperance canters
say that "it is unlawful to drink a glass of ale."  Unmanly canters say that "it is unlawful
to use one's fists."  The writer begs leave to tell both these species of canters that they
do not speak words of truth.

It is very lawful to take a cup of ale, or wine, for the purpose of cheering or invigorating
yourself when you are faint and down-hearted; and likewise to give a cup of ale or wine to
others when they are in a similar condition.  The Holy Scripture sayeth nothing to the contrary,
but rather encourageth people in so doing by the text, "Wine maketh glad the heart of man."
But it is not lawful to intoxicate yourself with frequent cups of ale or wine, nor to make
others intoxicated, nor does the Holy Scripture say it is.  The Holy Scripture no more says
that it is lawful to intoxicate yourself or others, than it says that it is unlawful to take
a cup of ale or wine yourself, or to give one to others.  Noah is not commended in the Scripture
for making himself drunken on the wine he brewed.  Nor is it said that the Saviour, when he
supplied the guests with first-rate wine at the marriage-feast, told them to make themselves
drunk upon it.  He is said to have supplied them with first-rate wine, but He doubtless left
the quantity which each should drink to each party's reason and discretion.  When you set a
good dinner before your guests, you do not expect that they should gorge themselves with the
victuals you set before them.  Wine may be abused, and so may a leg of mutton.

Second.  It is lawful for any one to use his fists in his own defence, or in the defence of
others, provided they can't help themselves; but it is not lawful to use them for purposes
of tyranny or brutality.  If you are attacked by a ruffian, as the elderly individual in Lavengro
is in the inn-yard, it is quite lawful, if you can, to give him as good a thrashing as the
elderly individual gave the brutal coachman; and if you see a helpless woman--perhaps your
own sister--set upon by a drunken lord, a drunken coachman, or a drunken coalheaver, or a brute
of any description, either drunk or sober, it is not only lawful but laudable, to give them,
if you can, a good drubbing; but it is not lawful because you have a strong pair of fists,
and know how to use them, to go swaggering through a fair, jostling against unoffending individuals;
should you do so, you would be served quite right if you were to get a drubbing, more particularly
if you were served out by some one less strong, but more skilful than yourself--even as the
coachman was served out by a pupil of the immortal Broughton--sixty years old, it is true,
but possessed of Broughton's guard and chop.  Moses is not blamed in the Scripture for taking
part with the oppressed, and killing an Egyptian persecutor.  We are not told how Moses killed
the Egyptian; but it is quite as creditable to Moses to suppose that he killed the Egyptian
by giving him a buffet under the left ear, as by stabbing him with a knife.  It is true that
the Saviour in the New Testament tells His disciples to turn the left cheek to be smitten,
after they had received a blow on the right; but He was speaking to people divinely inspired,
or whom He intended divinely to inspire--people selected by God for a particular purpose. 
He likewise tells these people to part with various articles of raiment when asked for them,
and to go a-travelling without money, and take no thought of the morrow.  Are those exhortations
carried out by very good people in the present day?  Do Quakers, when smitten on the right
cheek, turn the left to the smiter?  When asked for their coat, do they say, "Friend, take
my shirt also?"  Has the Dean of Salisbury no purse?  Does the Archbishop of Canterbury go
to an inn, run up a reckoning, and then say to his landlady, "Mistress, I have no coin?"  Assuredly
the Dean has a purse, and a tolerably well-filled one; and, assuredly, the Archbishop, on departing
from an inn, not only settles his reckoning, but leaves something handsome for the servants,
and does not say that he is forbidden by the gospel to pay for what he has eaten, or the trouble
he has given, as a certain Spanish cavalier said he was forbidden by the statutes of chivalry.
Now, to take the part of yourself, or the part of the oppressed, with your fists, is quite
as lawful in the present day as it is to refuse your coat and shirt also to any vagabond who
may ask for them, and not to refuse to pay for supper, bed, and breakfast, at the Feathers,
or any other inn, after you have had the benefit of all three.

The conduct of Lavengro with respect to drink may, upon the whole, serve as a model.  He is
no drunkard, nor is he fond of intoxicating other people; yet when the horrors are upon him
he has no objection to go to a public-house and call for a pint of ale, nor does he shrink
from recommending ale to others when they are faint and downcast.  In one instance, it is true,
he does what cannot be exactly justified; he encourages the Priest in the dingle, in more instances
than one, in drinking more hollands and water than is consistent with decorum.  He has a motive
indeed in doing so; a desire to learn from the knave in his cups the plans and hopes of the
Propaganda of Rome.  Such conduct, however, was inconsistent with strict fair dealing and openness;
and the author advises all those whose consciences never reproach them for a single unfair
or covert act committed by them, to abuse him heartily for administering hollands and water
to the Priest of Rome.  In that instance the hero is certainly wrong; yet in all other cases
with regard to drink, he is manifestly right.  To tell people that they are never to drink
a glass of ale or wine themselves, or to give one to others, is cant; and the writer has no
toleration for cant of any description.  Some cants are not dangerous; but the writer believes
that a more dangerous cant than the temperance cant, or as it is generally called, teetotalism,
is scarcely to be found.  The writer is willing to believe that it originated with well meaning,
though weak people; but there can be no doubt that it was quickly turned to account by people
who were neither well meaning nor weak.  Let the reader note particularly the purpose to which
this cry has been turned in America; the land, indeed, par excellence, of humbug and humbug
cries.  It is there continually in the mouth of the most violent political party, and is made
an instrument of almost unexampled persecution.  The writer would say more on the temperance
cant, both in England and America, but want of space prevents him.  There is one point on which
he cannot avoid making a few brief remarks--that is, the inconsistent conduct of its apostles
in general. The teetotal apostle says, it is a dreadful thing to be drunk.  So it is, teetotaller;
but if so, why do you get drunk?  I get drunk?  Yes, unhappy man, why do you get drunk on smoke
and passion?  Why are your garments impregnated with the odour of the Indian weed?  Why is
there a pipe or a cigar always in your mouth?  Why is your language more dreadful than that
of a Poissarde?  Tobacco-smoke is more deleterious than ale, teetotaller; bile more potent
than brandy.  You are fond of telling your hearers what an awful thing it is to die drunken.
So it is, teetotaller.  Then take good care that you do not die with smoke and passion, drunken,
and with temperance language on your lips; that is, abuse and calumny against all those who
differ from you.  One word of sense you have been heard to say, which is, that spirits may
be taken as a medicine.  Now you are in a fever of passion, teetotaller; so, pray take this
tumbler of brandy; take it on the homoeopathic principle, that heat is to be expelled by heat.
You are in a temperance fury, so swallow the contents of this tumbler, and it will, perhaps,
cure you.  You look at the glass wistfully--you occasionally take a glass medicinally--and
it is probable you do.  Take one now.  Consider what a dreadful thing it would be to die passion
drunk; to appear before your Maker with intemperate language on your lips.  That's right! 
You don't seem to wince at the brandy.  That's right!--well done!  All down in two pulls. 
Now you look like a reasonable being!

If the conduct of Lavengro with regard to drink is open to little censure, assuredly the use
which he makes of his fists is entitled to none at all.  Because he has a pair of tolerably
strong fists, and knows to a certain extent how to use them, is he a swaggerer or oppressor?
To what ill account does he turn them?  Who more quiet, gentle, and inoffensive than he?  He
beats off a ruffian who attacks him in a dingle; has a kind of friendly tuzzle with Mr. Petulengro,
and behold the extent of his fistic exploits.

Ay, but he associates with prize-fighters; and that very fellow, Petulengro, is a prize-fighter,
and has fought for a stake in a ring. Well, and if he had not associated with prize-fighters,
how could he have used his fists?  Oh, anybody can use his fists in his own defence, without
being taught by prize-fighters.  Can they?  Then why does not the Italian, or Spaniard, or
Affghan use his fists when insulted or outraged, instead of having recourse to the weapons
which he has recourse to? Nobody can use his fists without being taught the use of them by
those who have themselves been taught, no more than any one can "whiffle" without being taught
by a master of the art.  Now let any man of the present day try to whiffle.  Would not any
one who wished to whiffle have to go to a master of the art?  Assuredly! but where would he
find one at the present day?  The last of the whifflers hanged himself about a fortnight ago
on a bell-rope in a church steeple of "the old town," from pure grief that there was no further
demand for the exhibition of his art, there being no demand for whiffling since the discontinuation
of Guildhall banquets.  Whiffling is lost.  The old chap left his sword behind him; let any
one take up the old chap's sword and try to whiffle. Now much the same hand as he would make
who should take up the whiffler's sword and try to whiffle, would he who should try to use
his fists who had never had the advantage of a master.  Let no one think that men use their
fists naturally in their own disputes--men have naturally recourse to any other thing to defend
themselves or to offend others; they fly to the stick, to the stone, to the murderous and cowardly
knife, or to abuse as cowardly as the knife, and occasionally more murderous.  Now which is
best when you hate a person, or have a pique against a person, to clench your fist and say
"Come on," or to have recourse to the stone, the knife,--or murderous calumny?  The use of
the fist is almost lost in England.  Yet are the people better than they were when they knew
how to use their fists?  The writer believes not.  A fisty combat is at present a great rarity,
but the use of the knife, the noose, and of poison, to say nothing of calumny, are of more
frequent occurrence in England than perhaps in any country in Europe.  Is polite taste better
than when it could bear the details of a fight?  The writer believes not.  Two men cannot meet
in a ring to settle a dispute in a manly manner without some trumpery local newspaper letting
loose a volley of abuse against "the disgraceful exhibition," in which abuse it is sure to
be sanctioned by its dainty readers; whereas some murderous horror, the discovery for example
of the mangled remains of a woman in some obscure den, is greedily seized hold of by the moral
journal, and dressed up for its readers, who luxuriate and gloat upon the ghastly dish.  Now,
the writer of Lavengro has no sympathy with those who would shrink from striking a blow, but
would not shrink from the use of poison or calumny; and his taste has little in common with
that which cannot tolerate the hardy details of a prize-fight, but which luxuriates on descriptions
of the murder dens of modern England.  But prize-fighters and pugilists are blackguards, a
reviewer has said; and blackguards they would be provided they employed their skill and their
prowess for purposes of brutality and oppression; but prize-fighters and pugilists are seldom
friends to brutality and oppression; and which is the blackguard, the writer would ask, he
who uses his fists to take his own part, or instructs others to use theirs for the same purpose,
or the being who from envy and malice, or at the bidding of a malicious scoundrel, endeavours
by calumny, falsehood, and misrepresentation to impede the efforts of lonely and unprotected
genius?

One word more about the race, all but extinct, of the people opprobriously called prize-fighters.
Some of them have been as noble, kindly men as the world ever produced.  Can the rolls of the
English aristocracy exhibit names belonging to more noble, more heroic men than those who were
called respectively Pearce, Cribb, and Spring?  Did ever one of the English aristocracy contract
the seeds of fatal consumption by rushing up the stairs of a burning edifice, even to the topmost
garret, and rescuing a woman from seemingly inevitable destruction?  The writer says no.  A
woman was rescued from the top of a burning house; but the man who rescued her was no aristocrat;
it was Pearce, not Percy, who ran up the burning stairs.  Did ever one of those glittering
ones save a fainting female from the libidinous rage of six ruffians?  The writer believes
not.  A woman was rescued from the libidinous fury of six monsters on --- Down; but the man
who rescued her was no aristocrat; it was Pearce not Paulet, who rescued the woman, and thrashed
my lord's six gamekeepers--Pearce, whose equal never was, and probably never will be, found
in sturdy combat.  Are there any of the aristocracy of whom it can be said that they never
did a cowardly, cruel, or mean action, and that they invariably took the part of the unfortunate
and weak against cruelty and oppression?  As much can be said of Cribb, of Spring, and the
other; but where is the aristocrat of whom as much can be said?  Wellington? Wellington indeed!
a skilful general, and a good man of valour, it is true, but with that cant word of "duty"
continually on his lips, did he rescue Ney from his butchers?  Did he lend a helping hand to
Warner?

In conclusion, the writer would advise those of his country-folks who read his book to have
nothing to do with the two kinds of canting nonsense described above, but in their progress
through life to enjoy as well as they can, but always with moderation, the good things of this
world, to put confidence in God, to be as independent as possible, and to take their own parts.
If they are low-spirited, let them not make themselves foolish by putting on sackcloth, drinking
water, or chewing ashes, but let them take wholesome exercise, and eat the most generous food
they can get, taking up and reading occasionally, not the lives of Ignatius Loyola and Francis
Spira, but something more agreeable; for example, the life and adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell,
the deaf and dumb gentleman; the travels of Captain Falconer in America, and the journal of
John Randall, who went to Virginia and married an Indian wife; not forgetting, amidst their
eating and drinking, their walks over heaths, and by the sea-side, and their agreeable literature,
to be charitable to the poor, to read the Psalms and to go to church twice on a Sunday.  In
their dealings with people, to be courteous to everybody, as Lavengro was, but always independent
like him; and if people meddle with them, to give them as good as they bring, even as he and
Isopel Berners were in the habit of doing; and it will be as well for him to observe that he
by no means advises women to be too womanly, but bearing the conduct of Isopel Berners in mind,
to take their own parts, and if anybody strikes them, to strike again.

Beating of women by the lords of the creation has become very prevalent in England since pugilism
has been discountenanced.  Now the writer strongly advises any woman who is struck by a ruffian
to strike him again; or if she cannot clench her fists, and he advises all women in these singular
times to learn to clench their fists, to go at him with tooth and nail, and not to be afraid
of the result, for any fellow who is dastard enough to strike a woman, would allow himself
to be beaten by a woman, were she to make at him in self-defence, even if, instead of possessing
the stately height and athletic proportions of the aforesaid Isopel, she were as diminutive
in stature, and had a hand as delicate, and foot as small, as a certain royal lady, who was
some time ago assaulted by a fellow upwards of six feet high, whom the writer has no doubt
she could have beaten had she thought proper to go at him.  Such is the deliberate advice of
the author to his countrymen and women--advice in which he believes there is nothing unscriptural
or repugnant to common sense.

The writer is perfectly well aware that, by the plain language which he has used in speaking
of the various kinds of nonsense prevalent in England, he shall make himself a multitude of
enemies; but he is not going to conceal the truth or to tamper with nonsense, from the fear
of provoking hostility.  He has a duty to perform and he will perform it resolutely; he is
the person who carried the Bible to Spain; and as resolutely as he spoke in Spain against the
superstitions of Spain, will he speak in England against the nonsense of his own native land.
He is not one of those who, before they sit down to write a book, say to themselves, what cry
shall we take up? what principles shall we advocate? what principles shall we abuse? before
we put pen to paper we must find out what cry is the loudest, what principle has the most advocates,
otherwise, after having written our book, we may find ourselves on the weaker side.

A sailor of the "Bounty," waked from his sleep by the noise of the mutiny, lay still in his
hammock for some time, quite undecided whether to take part with the captain or to join the
mutineers.  "I must mind what I do," said he to himself, "lest, in the end, I find myself on
the weaker side;" finally, on hearing that the mutineers were successful, he went on deck,
and seeing Bligh pinioned to the mast, he put his fist to his nose, and otherwise insulted
him.  Now, there are many writers of the present day whose conduct is very similar to that
of the sailor.  They lie listening in their corners till they have ascertained which principle
has most advocates; then, presently, they make their appearance on the deck of the world with
their book; if truth has been victorious, then has truth the hurrah! but if truth is pinioned
against the mast, then is their fist thrust against the nose of truth, and their gibe and their
insult spirted in her face.  The strongest party had the sailor, and the strongest party has
almost invariably the writer of the present day.

CHAPTER IX--Pseudo-Critics.

A certain set of individuals calling themselves critics have attacked Lavengro with much virulence
and malice.  If what they call criticism had been founded on truth, the author would have had
nothing to say.  The book contains plenty of blemishes, some of them, by the bye, wilful ones,
as the writer will presently show; not one of these, however, has been detected and pointed
out; but the best passages in the book, indeed whatever was calculated to make the book valuable,
have been assailed with abuse and misrepresentation.  The duty of the true critic is to play
the part of a leech, and not of a viper.  Upon true and upon malignant criticism there is an
excellent fable by the Spaniard Iriarte.  The viper says to the leech, "Why do people invite
your bite, and flee from mine?" "Because," says the leech, "people receive health from my bite,
and poison from yours."  "There is as much difference," says the clever Spaniard, "between
true and malignant criticism, as between poison and medicine."  Certainly a great many meritorious
writers have allowed themselves to be poisoned by malignant criticism; the writer, however,
is not one of those who allow themselves to be poisoned by pseudo-critics; no! no! he will
rather hold them up by their tails, and show the creatures wriggling, blood and foam streaming
from their broken jaws. First of all, however, he will notice one of their objections.  "The
book isn't true," say they.  Now one of the principal reasons with those that have attacked
Lavengro for their abuse of it is, that it is particularly true in one instance, namely, that
it exposes their own nonsense, their love of humbug, their slavishness, their dressings, their
goings out, their scraping and bowing to great people; it is the showing up of "gentility-nonsense"
in Lavengro that has been one principal reason for raising the above cry; for in Lavengro is
denounced the besetting folly of the English people, a folly which those who call themselves
guardians of the public taste are far from being above.  "We can't abide anything that isn't
true!" they exclaim.  Can't they?  Then why are they so enraptured with any fiction that is
adapted to purposes of humbug, which tends to make them satisfied with their own proceedings,
with their own nonsense, which does not tell them to reform, to become more alive to their
own failings, and less sensitive about the tyrannical goings on of the masters, and the degraded
condition, the sufferings, and the trials of the serfs in the star Jupiter?  Had Lavengro,
instead of being the work of an independent mind, been written in order to further any of the
thousand and one cants, and species of nonsense prevalent in England, the author would have
heard much less about its not being true, both from public detractors and private censurers.

"But Lavengro pretends to be an autobiography," say the critics; and here the writer begs leave
to observe, that it would be well for people who profess to have a regard for truth, not to
exhibit in every assertion which they make a most profligate disregard of it; this assertion
of theirs is a falsehood, and they know it to be a falsehood.  In the preface Lavengro is stated
to be a dream; and the writer takes this opportunity of stating that he never said it was an
autobiography; never authorized any person to say that it was one; and that he has in innumerable
instances declared in public and private, both before and after the work was published, that
it was not what is generally termed an autobiography: but a set of people who pretend to write
criticisms on books, hating the author for various reasons,--amongst others, because, having
the proper pride of a gentleman and a scholar, he did not, in the year '43, choose to permit
himself to be exhibited and made a zany of in London, and especially because he will neither
associate with, nor curry favour with, them who are neither gentlemen nor scholars,--attack
his book with abuse and calumny.  He is, perhaps, condescending too much when he takes any
notice of such people; as, however, the English public is wonderfully led by cries and shouts,
and generally ready to take part against any person who is either unwilling or unable to defend
himself, he deems it advisable not to be altogether quiet with those who assail him.  The best
way to deal with vipers is to tear out their teeth; and the best way to deal with pseudo-critics
is to deprive them of their poison-bag, which is easily done by exposing their ignorance. 
The writer knew perfectly well the description of people with whom he would have to do, he
therefore very quietly prepared a stratagem, by means of which he could at any time exhibit
them, powerless and helpless, in his hand. Critics, when they review books, ought to have a
competent knowledge of the subjects which those books discuss.

Lavengro is a philological book, a poem if you choose to call it so.  Now, what a fine triumph
it would have been for those who wished to vilify the book and its author, provided they could
have detected the latter tripping in his philology--they might have instantly said that he
was an ignorant pretender to philology--they laughed at the idea of his taking up a viper by
its tail, a trick which hundreds of country urchins do every September, but they were silent
about the really wonderful part of the book, the philological matter--they thought philology
was his stronghold, and that it would be useless to attack him there; they of course would
give him no credit as a philologist, for anything like fair treatment towards him was not to
be expected at their hands, but they were afraid to attack his philology--yet that was the
point, and the only point in which they might have attacked him successfully; he was vulnerable
there.  How was this?  Why, in order to have an opportunity of holding up pseudo-critics by
the tails, he wilfully spelt various foreign words wrong--Welsh words, and even Italian words--did
they detect these misspellings? not one of them, even as he knew they would not, and he now
taunts them with ignorance; and the power of taunting them with ignorance is the punishment
which he designed for them--a power which they might but for their ignorance have used against
him.  The writer besides knowing something of Italian and Welsh, knows a little of Armenian
language and literature; but who knowing anything of the Armenian language, unless he had an
end in view, would say, that the word sea in Armenian is anything like the word tide in English?
The word for sea in Armenian is dzow, a word connected with the Tebetian word for water, and
the Chinese shuy, and the Turkish su, signifying the same thing; but where is the resemblance
between dzow and tide?  Again, the word for bread in ancient Armenian is hats; yet the Armenian
on London Bridge is made to say zhats, which is not the nominative of the Armenian noun for
bread, but the accusative: now, critics, ravening against a man because he is a gentleman and
a scholar, and has not only the power but also the courage to write original works, why did
you not discover that weak point?  Why, because you were ignorant, so here ye are held up!
Moreover, who with a name commencing with Z, ever wrote fables in Armenian?  There are two
writers of fables in Armenian--Varthan and Koscht, and illustrious writers they are, one in
the simple, and the other in the ornate style of Armenian composition, but neither of their
names begins with a Z.  Oh, what a precious opportunity ye lost, ye ravening crew, of convicting
the poor, half-starved, friendless boy of the book, of ignorance or misrepresentation, by asking
who with a name beginning with Z ever wrote fables in Armenian; but ye couldn't help yourselves,
ye are duncie.  We duncie!  Ay, duncie.  So here ye are held up by the tails, blood and foam
streaming from your jaws.

The writer wishes to ask here, what do you think of all this, Messieurs les Critiques?  Were
ye ever served so before?  But don't you richly deserve it?  Haven't you been for years past
bullying and insulting everybody whom you deemed weak, and currying favour with everybody whom
you thought strong?  "We approve of this.  We disapprove of that.  Oh, this will never do.
These are fine lines!"  The lines perhaps some horrid sycophantic rubbish addressed to Wellington,
or Lord So-and-so.  To have your ignorance thus exposed, to be shown up in this manner, and
by whom?  A gypsy!  Ay, a gypsy was the very right person to do it.  But is it not galling,
after all?

"Ah, but we don't understand Armenian, it cannot be expected that we should understand Armenian,
or Welsh, or--Hey, what's this?  The mighty we not understand Armenian or Welsh, or--Then why
does the mighty we pretend to review a book like Lavengro?  From the arrogance with which it
continually delivers itself, one would think that the mighty we is omniscient; that it understands
every language; is versed in every literature; yet the mighty we does not even know the word
for bread in Armenian.  It knows bread well enough by name in England, and frequently bread
in England only by its name, but the truth is, that the mighty we, with all its pretension,
is in general a very sorry creature, who, instead of saying nous disons, should rather say
nous dis: Porny in his "Guerre des Dieux," very profanely makes the three in one say, Je faisons;
now, Lavengro, who is anything but profane, would suggest that critics, especially magazine
and Sunday newspaper critics, should commence with nous dis, as the first word would be significant
of the conceit and assumption of the critic, and the second of the extent of the critic's information.
The we says its say, but when fawning sycophancy or vulgar abuse are taken from that say, what
remains?  Why a blank, a void like Ginnungagap.

As the writer, of his own accord, has exposed some of the blemishes of his book--a task, which
a competent critic ought to have done--he will now point out two or three of its merits, which
any critic, not altogether blinded with ignorance might have done, or not replete with gall
and envy would have been glad to do.  The book has the merit of communicating a fact connected
with physiology, which in all the pages of the multitude of books was never previously mentioned--the
mysterious practice of touching objects to baffle the evil chance.  The miserable detractor
will, of course, instantly begin to rave about such a habit being common: well and good; but
was it ever before described in print, or all connected with it dissected?  He may then vociferate
something about Johnson having touched:--the writer cares not whether Johnson, who, by the
bye, during the last twenty or thirty years, owing to people having become ultra Tory mad from
reading Scott's novels and the "Quarterly Review," has been a mighty favourite, especially
with some who were in the habit of calling him a half crazy old fool--touched, or whether he
did or not; but he asks where did Johnson ever describe the feelings which induced him to perform
the magic touch, even supposing that he did perform it?  Again, the history gives an account
of a certain book called the "Sleeping Bard," the most remarkable prose work of the most difficult
language but one, of modern Europe,--a book, for a notice of which, he believes, one might
turn over in vain the pages of any review printed in England, or, indeed, elsewhere.--So here
are two facts, one literary and the other physiological, for which any candid critic was bound
to thank the author, even as in Romany Rye there is a fact connected with Iro Norman Myth,
for the disclosing of which, any person who pretends to have a regard for literature is bound
to thank him, namely, that the mysterious Finn or Fingal of "Ossian's Poems" is one and the
same person as the Sigurd Fofnisbane of the Edda and the Wilkina, and the Siegfried Horn of
the Lay of the Niebelungs.

The writer might here conclude, and, he believes, most triumphantly; as, however, he is in
the cue for writing, which he seldom is, he will for his own gratification, and for the sake
of others, dropping metaphors about vipers and serpents, show up in particular two or three
sets or cliques of people, who, he is happy to say, have been particularly virulent against
him and his work, for nothing indeed could have given him greater mortification than their praise.

In the first place, he wishes to dispose of certain individuals who call themselves men of
wit and fashion--about town--who he is told have abused his book "vaustly"--their own word.
These people paint their cheeks, wear white kid gloves, and dabble in literature, or what they
conceive to be literature.  For abuse from such people, the writer was prepared.  Does any
one imagine that the writer was not well aware, before he published his book, that, whenever
he gave it to the world, he should be attacked by every literary coxcomb in England who had
influence enough to procure the insertion of a scurrilous article in a magazine or newspaper!
He has been in Spain, and has seen how invariably the mule attacks the horse; now why does
the mule attack the horse?  Why, because the latter carries about with him that which the envious
hermaphrodite does not possess.

They consider, forsooth, that his book is low--but he is not going to waste words about them--one
or two of whom, he is told, have written very duncie books about Spain, and are highly enraged
with him, because certain books which he wrote about Spain were not considered duncie.  No,
he is not going to waste words upon them, for verily he dislikes their company, and so he'll
pass them by, and proceed to others.

The Scotch Charlie o'er the water people have been very loud in the abuse of Lavengro--this
again might be expected; the sarcasms of the Priest about the Charlie o'er the water nonsense
of course stung them.  Oh! it is one of the claims which Lavengro has to respect, that it is
the first, if not the only work, in which that nonsense is, to a certain extent, exposed. 
Two or three of their remarks on passages of Lavengro, he will reproduce and laugh at.  Of
course your Charlie o'er the water people are genteel exceedingly, and cannot abide anything
low.  Gypsyism they think is particularly low, and the use of gypsy words in literature beneath
its gentility; so they object to gypsy words being used in Lavengro where gypsies are introduced
speaking--"What is Romany forsooth?" say they. Very good!  And what is Scotch? has not the
public been nauseated with Scotch for the last thirty years?  "Ay, but Scotch is not"--the
writer believes he knows much better than the Scotch what Scotch is and what it is not; he
has told them before what it is, a very sorry jargon.  He will now tell them what it is not--a
sister or an immediate daughter of the Sanscrit, which Romany is.  "Ay, but the Scotch are"--foxes,
foxes, nothing else than foxes, even like the gypsies--the difference between the gypsy and
Scotch fox being that the first is wild, with a mighty brush, the other a sneak with a gilt
collar and without a tail.

A Charlie o'er the water person attempts to be witty, because the writer has said that perhaps
a certain old Edinburgh High-School porter, of the name of Boee, was perhaps of the same blood
as a certain Bui, a Northern Kemp who distinguished himself at the battle of Horinger Bay.
A pretty matter, forsooth, to excite the ridicule of a Scotchman!  Why, is there a beggar or
trumpery fellow in Scotland, who does not pretend to be somebody, or related to somebody? 
Is not every Scotchman descended from some king, kemp, or cow-stealer of old, by his own account
at least?  Why, the writer would even go so far as to bet a trifle that the poor creature,
who ridicules Boee's supposed ancestry, has one of his own, at least as grand and as apocryphal
as old Boee's of the High School.

The same Charlie o'er the water person is mightily indignant that Lavengro should have spoken
disrespectfully of William Wallace; Lavengro, when he speaks of that personage, being a child
of about ten years old, and repeating merely what he had heard.  All the Scotch, by the bye,
for a great many years past, have been great admirers of William Wallace, particularly the
Charlie o'er the water people, who in their nonsense- verses about Charlie generally contrive
to bring in the name of William, Willie, or Wullie Wallace.  The writer begs leave to say that
he by no means wishes to bear hard against William Wallace, but he cannot help asking why,
if William, Willie, or Wullie Wallace was such a particularly nice person, did his brother
Scots betray him to a certain renowned southern warrior, called Edward Longshanks, who caused
him to be hanged and cut into four in London, and his quarters to be placed over the gates
of certain towns?  They got gold, it is true, and titles, very nice things, no doubt; but,
surely, the life of a patriot is better than all the gold and titles in the world--at least
Lavengro thinks so--but Lavengro has lived more with gypsies than Scotchmen, and gypsies do
not betray their brothers.  It would be some time before a gypsy would hand over his brother
to the harum-beck, even supposing you would not only make him a king, but a justice of the
peace, and not only give him the world, but the best farm on the Holkham estate; but gypsies
are wild foxes, and there is certainly a wonderful difference between the way of thinking of
the wild fox who retains his brush, and that of the scurvy kennel creature who has lost his tail.

Ah! but thousands of Scotch, and particularly the Charlie o'er the water people, will say,
"We didn't sell Willie Wallace, it was our forbears who sold Willie Wallace--If Edward Longshanks
had asked us to sell Wullie Wallace, we would soon have shown him that--"  Lord better ye,
ye poor trumpery set of creatures, ye would not have acted a bit better than your forefathers;
remember how ye have ever treated the few amongst ye who, though born in the kennel, have shown
something of the spirit of the wood.  Many of ye are still alive who delivered over men, quite
as honest and patriotic as William Wallace, into the hands of an English minister, to be chained
and transported for merely venturing to speak and write in the cause of humanity, at the time
when Europe was beginning to fling off the chains imposed by kings and priests.  And it is
not so very long since Burns, to whom ye are now building up obelisks rather higher than he
deserves, was permitted by his countrymen to die in poverty and misery, because he would not
join with them in songs of adulation to kings and the trumpery great.  So say not that ye would
have acted with respect to William Wallace one whit better than your fathers--and you in particular,
ye children of Charlie, whom do ye write nonsense-verses about?  A family of dastard despots,
who did their best, during a century and more, to tread out the few sparks of independent feeling
still glowing in Scotland--but enough has been said about ye.

Amongst those who have been prodigal in abuse and defamation of Lavengro, have been your modern
Radicals, and particularly a set of people who filled the country with noise against the King
and Queen, Wellington, and the Tories, in '32.  About these people the writer will presently
have occasion to say a good deal, and also of real Radicals.  As, however, it may be supposed
that he is one of those who delight to play the sycophant to kings and queens, to curry favour
with Tories, and to bepraise Wellington, he begs leave to state that such is not the case.

About kings and queens he has nothing to say; about Tories, simply that he believes them to
be a bad set; about Wellington, however, it will be necessary for him to say a good deal, of
mixed import, as he will subsequently frequently have occasion to mention him in connection
with what he has to say about pseudo-Radicals.

CHAPTER X--Pseudo-Radicals.

About Wellington, then, he says, that he believes him at the present day to be infinitely overrated.
But there certainly was a time when he was shamefully underrated.  Now what time was that?
Why the time of pseudo- Radicalism, par excellence, from '20 to '32.  Oh, the abuse that was
heaped on Wellington by those who traded in Radical cant--your newspaper editors and review
writers! and how he was sneered at then by your Whigs, and how faintly supported he was by
your Tories, who were half ashamed of him; for your Tories, though capital fellows as followers,
when you want nobody to back you, are the faintest creatures in the world when you cry in your
agony, "Come and help me!"  Oh, assuredly Wellington was infamously used at that time, especially
by your traders in Radicalism, who howled at and hooted him; said he had every vice--was no
general--was beaten at Waterloo--was a poltroon--moreover a poor illiterate creature, who could
scarcely read or write; nay, a principal Radical paper said boldly he could not read, and devised
an ingenious plan for teaching Wellington how to read.  Now this was too bad; and the writer,
being a lover of justice, frequently spoke up for Wellington, saying, that as for vice, he
was not worse than his neighbours; that he was brave; that he won the fight at Waterloo, from
a half-dead man, it is true, but that he did win it.  Also, that he believed he had read "Rules
for the Manual and Platoon Exercises" to some purpose; moreover, that he was sure he could
write, for that he the writer had once written to Wellington, and had received an answer from
him; nay, the writer once went so far as to strike a blow for Wellington; for the last time
he used his fists was upon a Radical sub-editor, who was mobbing Wellington in the street,
from behind a rank of grimy fellows; but though the writer spoke up for Wellington to a certain
extent, when he was shamefully underrated, and once struck a blow for him when he was about
being hustled, he is not going to join in the loathsome sycophantic nonsense which it has been
the fashion to use with respect to Wellington these last twenty years.  Now what have those
years been to England!  Why the years of ultra-gentility, everybody in England having gone
gentility mad during the last twenty years, and no people more so than your pseudo-Radicals.
Wellington was turned out, and your Whigs and Radicals got in, and then commenced the period
of ultra-gentility in England.  The Whigs and Radicals only hated Wellington as long as the
patronage of the country was in his hands, none of which they were tolerably sure he would
bestow on them; but no sooner did they get it into their own, than they forthwith became admirers
of Wellington.  And why?  Because he was a duke, petted at Windsor and by foreign princes,
and a very genteel personage.  Formerly many of your Whigs and Radicals had scarcely a decent
coat on their backs; but now the plunder of the country was at their disposal, and they had
as good a chance of being genteel as any people.  So they were willing to worship Wellington
because he was very genteel, and could not keep the plunder of the country out of their hands.
And Wellington has been worshipped, and prettily so, during the last fifteen or twenty years.
He is now a noble fine-hearted creature; the greatest general the world ever produced; the
bravest of men; and--and--mercy upon us! the greatest of military writers!  Now the present
writer will not join in such sycophancy.  As he was not afraid to take the part of Wellington
when he was scurvily used by all parties, and when it was dangerous to take his part, so he
is not afraid to speak the naked truth about Wellington in these days, when it is dangerous
to say anything about him but what is sycophantically laudatory.  He said in '32, that as to
vice, Wellington was not worse than his neighbours; but he is not going to say, in '54, that
Wellington was a noble-hearted fellow; for he believes that a more cold-hearted individual
never existed.  His conduct to Warner, the poor Vaudois, and Marshal Ney, showed that.  He
said, in '32, that he was a good general and a brave man; but he is not going, in '54, to say
that he was the best general, or the bravest man the world ever saw.  England has produced
a better general--France two or three--both countries many braver men.  The son of the Norfolk
clergyman was a brave man; Marshal Ney was a braver man.  Oh, that battle of Copenhagen!  Oh,
that covering the retreat of the Grand Army!  And though he said in '32 that he could write,
he is not going to say in '54 that he is the best of all military writers.  On the contrary,
he does not hesitate to say that any Commentary of Julius Caesar, or any chapter in Justinus,
more especially the one about the Parthians, is worth the ten volumes of Wellington's Despatches;
though he has no doubt that, by saying so, he shall especially rouse the indignation of a certain
newspaper, at present one of the most genteel journals imaginable--with a slight tendency to
Liberalism, it is true, but perfectly genteel--which is nevertheless the very one which, in
'32, swore bodily that Wellington could neither read nor write, and devised an ingenious plan
for teaching him how to read.

Now, after the above statement, no one will venture to say, if the writer should be disposed
to bear hard upon Radicals, that he would be influenced by a desire to pay court to princes,
or to curry favour with Tories, or from being a blind admirer of the Duke of Wellington; but
the writer is not going to declaim against Radicals, that is, real Republicans, or their principles;
upon the whole, he is something of an admirer of both.  The writer has always had as much admiration
for everything that is real and honest as he has had contempt for the opposite.  Now real Republicanism
is certainly a very fine thing, a much finer thing than Toryism, a system of common robbery,
which is nevertheless far better than Whiggism {7}--a compound of petty larceny, popular instruction,
and receiving of stolen goods.  Yes, real Republicanism is certainly a very fine thing, and
your real Radicals and Republicans are certainly very fine fellows, or rather were fine fellows,
for the Lord only knows where to find them at the present day--the writer does not.  If he
did, he would at any time go five miles to invite one of them to dinner, even supposing that
he had to go to a workhouse in order to find the person he wished to invite.  Amongst the real
Radicals of England, those who flourished from the year '16 to '20, there were certainly extraordinary
characters, men partially insane, perhaps, but honest and brave--they did not make a market
of the principles which they professed, and never intended to do so; they believed in them,
and were willing to risk their lives in endeavouring to carry them out.  The writer wishes
to speak in particular of two of these men, both of whom perished on the scaffold--their names
were Thistlewood and Ings. Thistlewood, the best known of them, was a brave soldier, and had
served with distinction as an officer in the French service; he was one of the excellent swordsmen
of Europe; had fought several duels in France, where it is no child's play to fight a duel;
but had never unsheathed his sword for single combat, but in defence of the feeble and insulted--he
was kind and open-hearted, but of too great simplicity; he had once ten thousand pounds left
him, all of which he lent to a friend, who disappeared and never returned a penny.  Ings was
an uneducated man, of very low stature, but amazing strength and resolution; he was a kind
husband and father, and though a humble butcher, the name he bore was one of the royal names
of the heathen Anglo-Saxons.  These two men, along with five others, were executed, and their
heads hacked off, for levying war against George the Fourth; the whole seven dying in a manner
which extorted cheers from the populace; the most of then uttering philosophical or patriotic
sayings. Thistlewood, who was, perhaps, the most calm and collected of all, just before he
was turned off, said, "We are now going to discover the great secret."  Ings, the moment before
he was choked, was singing "Scots wha ha' wi' Wallace bled."  Now there was no humbug about
those men, nor about many more of the same time and of the same principles.  They might be
deluded about Republicanism, as Algernon Sidney was, and as Brutus was, but they were as honest
and brave as either Brutus or Sidney; and as willing to die for their principles.  But the
Radicals who succeeded them were beings of a very different description; they jobbed and traded
in Republicanism, and either parted with it, or at the present day are eager to part with it
for a consideration.  In order to get the Whigs into power, and themselves places, they brought
the country by their inflammatory language to the verge of a revolution, and were the cause
that many perished on the scaffold; by their incendiary harangues and newspaper articles they
caused the Bristol conflagration, for which six poor creatures were executed; they encouraged
the mob to pillage, pull down and burn, and then rushing into garrets looked on.  Thistlewood
tells the mob the Tower is a second Bastile; let it be pulled down.  A mob tries to pull down
the Tower; but Thistlewood is at the head of that mob; he is not peeping from a garret on Tower
Hill like Gulliver at Lisbon.  Thistlewood and Ings say to twenty ragged individuals, Liverpool
and Castlereagh are two satellites of despotism; it would be highly desirable to put them out
of the way.  And a certain number of ragged individuals are surprised in a stable in Cato Street,
making preparations to put Castlereagh and Liverpool out of the way, and are fired upon with
muskets by Grenadiers, and are hacked at with cutlasses by Bow Street runners; but the twain
who encouraged those ragged individuals to meet in Cato Street are not far off, they are not
on the other side of the river, in the Borough, for example, in some garret or obscure cellar.
The very first to confront the Guards and runners are Thistlewood and Ings; Thistlewood whips
his long thin rapier through Smithers' lungs, and Ings makes a dash at Fitzclarence with his
butcher's knife.  Oh, there was something in those fellows! honesty and courage--but can as
much be said for the inciters of the troubles of '32?  No; they egged on poor ignorant mechanics
and rustics, and got them hanged for pulling down and burning, whilst the highest pitch to
which their own daring ever mounted was to mob Wellington as he passed in the streets.

Now, these people were humbugs, which Thistlewood and Ings were not.  They raved and foamed
against kings, queens, Wellington, the aristocracy, and what not, till they had got the Whigs
into power, with whom they were in secret alliance, and with whom they afterwards openly joined
in a system of robbery and corruption, more flagitious than the old Tory one, because there
was more cant about it; for themselves they got consulships, commissionerships, and in some
instances governments; for their sons clerkships in public offices; and there you may see those
sons with the never-failing badge of the low scoundrel-puppy, the gilt chain at the waistcoat
pocket; and there you may hear and see them using the languishing tones, and employing the
airs and graces which wenches use and employ, who, without being in the family way, wish to
make their keepers believe that they are in the family way.  Assuredly great is the cleverness
of your Radicals of '32, in providing for themselves and their families.  Yet, clever as they
are, there is one thing they cannot do--they get governments for themselves, commissionerships
for their brothers, clerkships for their sons, but there is one thing beyond their craft--they
cannot get husbands for their daughters, who, too ugly for marriage, and with their heads filled
with the nonsense they have imbibed from gentility-novels, go over from Socinus to the Pope,
becoming sisters in fusty convents, or having heard a few sermons in Mr. Platitude's "chapelle,"
seek for admission at the establishment of mother S---, who, after employing them for a time
in various menial offices, and making them pluck off their eyebrows hair by hair, generally
dismisses them on the plea of sluttishness; whereupon they return to their papas to eat the
bread of the country, with the comfortable prospect of eating it still in the shape of a pension
after their sires are dead.  Papa (ex uno disce omnes) living as quietly as he can; not exactly
enviably, it is true, being now and then seen to cast an uneasy and furtive glance behind,
even as an animal is wont, who has lost by some mischance a very slight appendage; as quietly
however as he can, and as dignifiedly, a great admirer of every genteel thing and genteel personage,
the Duke in particular, whose "Despatches," bound in red morocco, you will find on his table.
A disliker of coarse expressions, and extremes of every kind, with a perfect horror for revolutions
and attempts to revolutionize, exclaiming now and then, as a shriek escapes from whipped and
bleeding Hungary, a groan from gasping Poland, and a half-stifled curse from down- trodden
but scowling Italy, "Confound the revolutionary canaille, why can't it be quiet!" in a word,
putting one in mind of the parvenu in the "Walpurgis Nacht."  The writer is no admirer of Gothe,
but the idea of that parvenu was certainly a good one.  Yes, putting one in mind of the individual
who says--

   "Wir waren wahrlich auch nicht dumm,
      Und thaten oft was wir nicht sollten;
   Doch jetzo kehrt sich alles um und um,
      Und eben da wir's fest erhalten wollten."

   We were no fools, as every one discern'd,
      And stopp'd at nought our projects in fulfilling;
   But now the world seems topsy-turvy turn'd,
      To keep it quiet just when we were willing.

Now, this class of individuals entertain a mortal hatred for Lavengro and its writer, and never
lose an opportunity of vituperating both.  It is true that such hatred is by no means surprising.
There is certainly a great deal of difference between Lavengro and their own sons; the one
thinking of independence and philology, whilst he is clinking away at kettles, and hammering
horse-shoes in dingles; the others stuck up at public offices with gilt chains at their waistcoat-pockets,
and giving themselves the airs and graces of females of a certain description.  And there certainly
is a great deal of difference between the author of Lavengro and themselves--he retaining his
principles and his brush; they with scarlet breeches on, it is true, but without their Republicanism,
and their tails.  Oh, the writer can well afford to be vituperated by your pseudo-Radicals of '32!

Some time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and his wife; but the matter is too
rich not to require a chapter to itself.

CHAPTER XI--The Old Radical.

   "This very dirty man, with his very dirty face,
   Would do any dirty act, which would get him a place."

Some time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and his wife; but before he relates
the manner in which they set upon him, it will be as well to enter upon a few particulars tending
to elucidate their reasons for so doing.

The writer had just entered into his eighteenth year, when he met at the table of a certain
Anglo-Germanist an individual, apparently somewhat under thirty, of middle stature, a thin
and weaselly figure, a sallow complexion, a certain obliquity of vision, and a large pair of
spectacles.  This person, who had lately come from abroad, and had published a volume of translations,
had attracted some slight notice in the literary world, and was looked upon as a kind of lion
in a small provincial capital.  After dinner he argued a great deal, spoke vehemently against
the church, and uttered the most desperate Radicalism that was perhaps ever heard, saying,
he hoped that in a short time there would not be a king or queen in Europe, and inveighing
bitterly against the English aristocracy, and against the Duke of Wellington in particular,
whom he said, if he himself was ever president of an English republic--an event which he seemed
to think by no means improbable--he would hang for certain infamous acts of profligacy and
bloodshed which he had perpetrated in Spain.  Being informed that the writer was something
of a philologist, to which character the individual in question laid great pretensions, he
came and sat down by him, and talked about languages and literature.  The writer, who was only
a boy, was a little frightened at first, but, not wishing to appear a child of absolute ignorance,
he summoned what little learning he had, and began to blunder out something about the Celtic
languages and literature, and asked the Lion who he conceived Finn-Ma-Coul to be? and whether
he did not consider the "Ode to the Fox," by Red Rhys of Eryry, to be a masterpiece of pleasantry?
Receiving no answer to these questions from the Lion, who, singular enough, would frequently,
when the writer put a question to him, look across the table, and flatly contradict some one
who was talking to some other person, the writer dropped the Celtic languages and literature,
and asked him whether he did not think it a funny thing that Temugin, generally called Genghis
Khan, should have married the daughter of Prester John?  {8} The Lion, after giving a side-glance
at the writer through his left spectacle glass, seemed about to reply, but was unfortunately
prevented, being seized with an irresistible impulse to contradict a respectable doctor of
medicine, who was engaged in conversation with the master of the house at the upper and farther
end of the table, the writer being a poor ignorant lad, sitting of course at the bottom.  The
doctor, who had served in the Peninsula, having observed that Ferdinand the Seventh was not
quite so bad as had been represented, the Lion vociferated that he was ten times worse, and
that he hoped to see him and the Duke of Wellington hanged together.  The doctor, who, being
a Welshman, was somewhat of a warm temper, growing rather red, said that at any rate he had
been informed that Ferdinand the Seventh knew sometimes how to behave himself like a gentleman--this
brought on a long dispute, which terminated rather abruptly.  The Lion having observed that
the doctor must not talk about Spanish matters with one who had visited every part of Spain,
the doctor bowed, and said he was right, for that he believed no people in general possessed
such accurate information about countries as those who had travelled them as bagmen.  On the
Lion asking the doctor what he meant, the Welshman, whose under jaw began to move violently,
replied, that he meant what he said.  Here the matter ended, for the Lion, turning from him,
looked at the writer.  The writer, imagining that his own conversation hitherto had been too
trivial and common-place for the Lion to consider worth his while to take much notice of it,
determined to assume a little higher ground, and after repeating a few verses of the Koran,
and gabbling a little Arabic, asked the Lion what he considered to be the difference between
the Hegira and the Christian era, adding, that he thought the general computation was in error
by about one year; and being a particularly modest person, chiefly, he believes, owing to his
having been at school in Ireland, absolutely blushed at finding that the Lion returned not
a word in answer.  "What a wonderful individual I am seated by," thought he, "to whom Arabic
seems a vulgar speech, and a question about the Hegira not worthy of an answer!" not reflecting
that as lions come from the Sahara, they have quite enough of Arabic at home, and that the
question about the Hegira was rather mal a propos to one used to prey on the flesh of hadjis.
"Now I only wish he would vouchsafe me a little of his learning," thought the boy to himself,
and in this wish he was at last gratified; for the Lion, after asking him whether he was acquainted
at all with the Sclavonian languages, and being informed that he was not, absolutely dumb-foundered
him by a display of Sclavonian erudition.

Years rolled by--the writer was a good deal about, sometimes in London, sometimes in the country,
sometimes abroad; in London he occasionally met the man of the spectacles, who was always very
civil to him, and, indeed, cultivated his acquaintance.  The writer thought it rather odd that,
after he himself had become acquainted with the Sclavonian languages and literature, the man
of the spectacles talked little or nothing about them.  In a little time, however, the matter
ceased to cause him the slightest surprise, for he had discovered a key to the mystery.  In
the mean time the man of spectacles was busy enough; he speculated in commerce, failed, and
paid his creditors twenty pennies in the pound; published translations, of which the public
at length became heartily tired; having, indeed, got an inkling of the manner in which those
translations were got up.  He managed, however, to ride out many a storm, having one trusty
sheet-anchor--Radicalism.  This he turned to the best advantage--writing pamphlets and articles
in reviews, all in the Radical interest, and for which he was paid out of the Radical fund;
which articles and pamphlets, when Toryism seemed to reel on its last legs, exhibited a slight
tendency to Whiggism.  Nevertheless, his abhorrence of desertion of principle was so great
in the time of the Duke of Wellington's administration, that when S--- left the Whigs and went
over, he told the writer, who was about that time engaged with him in a literary undertaking,
that the said S--- was a fellow with a character so infamous, that any honest man would rather
that you spit in his face than insult his ears with the mention of the name of S---.

The literary project having come to nothing,--in which, by the bye, the writer was to have
all the labour, and his friend all the credit, provided any credit should accrue from it,--the
writer did not see the latter for some years, during which time considerable political changes
took place; the Tories were driven from, and the Whigs placed in, office, both events being
brought about by the Radicals coalescing with the Whigs, over whom they possessed great influence
for the services which they had rendered.  When the writer next visited his friend, he found
him very much altered; his opinions were by no means so exalted as they had been--he was not
disposed even to be rancorous against the Duke of Wellington, saying that there were worse
men than he, and giving him some credit as a general; a hankering after gentility seeming to
pervade the whole family, father and sons, wife and daughters, all of whom talked about genteel
diversions--gentility novels, and even seemed to look with favour on High Churchism, having
in former years, to all appearance, been bigoted Dissenters.  In a little time the writer went
abroad; as, indeed, did his friend; not, however, like the writer, at his own expense, but
at that of the country--the Whigs having given him a travelling appointment, which he held
for some years, during which he received upwards of twelve thousand pounds of the money of
the country, for services which will, perhaps, be found inscribed on certain tablets, when
another Astolfo shall visit the moon.  This appointment, however, he lost on the Tories resuming
power--when the writer found him almost as Radical and patriotic as ever, just engaged in trying
to get into Parliament, into which he got by the assistance of his Radical friends, who, in
conjunction with the Whigs, were just getting up a crusade against the Tories, which they intended
should be a conclusive one.

A little time after the publication of "The Bible in Spain," the Tories being still in power,
this individual, full of the most disinterested friendship for the author, was particularly
anxious that he should be presented with an official situation, in a certain region a great
many miles off.  "You are the only person for that appointment," said he; "you understand a
great deal about the country, and are better acquainted with the two languages spoken there
than any one in England.  Now I love my country, and have, moreover, a great regard for you,
and as I am in Parliament, and have frequent opportunities of speaking to the Ministry, I shall
take care to tell them how desirable it would be to secure your services.  It is true they
are Tories, but I think that even Tories would give up their habitual love of jobbery in a
case like yours, and for once show themselves disposed to be honest men and gentlemen; indeed,
I have no doubt they will, for having so deservedly an infamous character, they would be glad
to get themselves a little credit, by a presentation which could not possibly be traced to
jobbery or favouritism."

The writer begged his friend to give himself no trouble about the matter, as he was not desirous
of the appointment, being in tolerably easy circumstances, and willing to take some rest after
a life of labour.  All, however, that he could say was of no use, his friend indignantly observing,
that the matter ought to be taken entirely out of his hands, and the appointment thrust upon
him for the credit of the country.  "But may not many people be far more worthy of the appointment
than myself?" said the writer.  "Where?" said the friendly Radical.  "If you don't get it,
it will be made a job of, given to the son of some steward, or, perhaps, to some quack who
has done dirty work; I tell you what, I shall ask it for you, in spite of you; I shall, indeed!"
and his eyes flashed with friendly and patriotic fervour through the large pair of spectacles
which he wore.

And, in fact, it would appear that the honest and friendly patriot put his threat into execution.
"I have spoken," said he, "more than once to this and that individual in Parliament, and everybody
seems to think that the appointment should be given to you.  Nay, that you should be forced
to accept it.  I intend next to speak to Lord A---"  And so he did, at least it would appear
so.  On the writer calling upon him one evening, about a week afterwards, in order to take
leave of him, as the writer was about to take a long journey for the sake of his health, his
friend no sooner saw him than he started up in a violent fit of agitation, and glancing about
the room, in which there were several people, amongst others two Whig members of Parliament,
said, "I am glad you are come, I was just speaking about you.  This," said he, addressing the
two members, "is so and so, the author of so and so, the well-known philologist; as I was telling
you, I spoke to Lord A--- this day about him, and said that he ought forthwith to have the
head appointment in--and what did the fellow say?  Why, that there was no necessity for such
an appointment at all, and if there were, why--and then he hummed and ha'd.  Yes," said he,
looking at the writer, "he did indeed.  What a scandal! what an infamy! But I see how it will
be, it will be a job.  The place will be given to some son of a steward or to some quack, as
I said before.  Oh, these Tories!  Well, if this does not make one--"  Here he stopped short,
crunched his teeth, and looked the image of desperation.

Seeing the poor man in this distressed condition, the writer begged him to be comforted, and
not to take the matter so much to heart; but the indignant Radical took the matter very much
to heart, and refused all comfort whatever, bouncing about the room, and, whilst his spectacles
flashed in the light of four spermaceti candles, exclaiming, "It will be a job--a Tory job!
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all!"

And a job it proved, and a very pretty job, but no Tory job.  Shortly afterwards the Tories
were out, and the Whigs were in.  From that time the writer heard not a word about the injustice
done to the country in not presenting him with the appointment to ---; the Radical, however,
was busy enough to obtain the appointment, not for the writer, but for himself, and eventually
succeeded, partly through Radical influence, and partly through that of a certain Whig lord,
for whom the Radical had done, on a particular occasion, work of a particular kind.  So, though
the place was given to a quack, and the whole affair a very pretty job, it was one in which
the Tories had certainly no hand.

In the meanwhile, however, the friendly Radical did not drop the writer. Oh, no!  On various
occasions he obtained from the writer all the information about the country in question, and
was particularly anxious to obtain from the writer, and eventually did obtain, a copy of a
work written in the court language of that country, edited by the writer, a language exceedingly
difficult, which the writer, at the expense of a considerable portion of his eyesight, had
acquired, at least as far as by the eyesight it could be acquired.  What use the writer's friend
made of the knowledge he had gained from him, and what use he made of the book, the writer
can only guess; but he has little doubt that when the question of sending a person to --- was
mooted in a Parliamentary Committee--which it was at the instigation of the writer's friend--the
Radical on being examined about the country, gave the information which he had obtained from
the writer as his own, and flashed the book and its singular characters in the eyes of the
Committee; and then of course his Radical friends would instantly say, "This is the man! there
is no one like him. See what information he possesses; and see that book written by himself
in the court language of Serendib.  This is the only man to send there. What a glory, what
a triumph it would be to Britain, to send out a man so deeply versed in the mysterious lore
of--as our illustrious countryman; a person who with his knowledge could beat with their own
weapons the wise men of-- Is such an opportunity to be lost?  Oh, no! surely not; if it is,
it will be an eternal disgrace to England, and the world will see that Whigs are no better
than Tories."

Let no one think the writer uncharitable in these suppositions.  The writer is only too well
acquainted with the antecedents of the individual, to entertain much doubt that he would shrink
from any such conduct, provided he thought that his temporal interest would be forwarded by
it.  The writer is aware of more than one instance in which he has passed off the literature
of friendless young men for his own, after making them a slight pecuniary compensation and
deforming what was originally excellent by interpolations of his own.  This was his especial
practice with regard to translation, of which he would fain be esteemed the king.  This Radical
literato is slightly acquainted with four or five of the easier dialects of Europe, on the
strength of which knowledge he would fain pass for a universal linguist, publishing translations
of pieces originally written in various difficult languages; which translations, however, were
either made by himself from literal renderings done for him into French or German, or had been
made from the originals into English, by friendless young men, and then deformed by his alterations.

Well, the Radical got the appointment, and the writer certainly did not grudge it him.  He,
of course, was aware that his friend had behaved in a very base manner towards him, but he
bore him no ill-will, and invariably when he heard him spoken against, which was frequently
the case, took his part when no other person would; indeed, he could well afford to bear him
no ill-will.  He had never sought for the appointment, nor wished for it, nor, indeed, ever
believed himself to be qualified for it.  He was conscious, it is true, that he was not altogether
unacquainted with the language and literature of the country with which the appointment was
connected.  He was likewise aware that he was not altogether deficient in courage and in propriety
of behaviour.  He knew that his appearance was not particularly against him; his face not being
like that of a convicted pickpocket, nor his gait resembling that of a fox who has lost his
tail; yet he never believed himself adapted for the appointment, being aware that he had no
aptitude for the doing of dirty work, if called to do it, nor pliancy which would enable him
to submit to scurvy treatment, whether he did dirty work or not--requisites, at the time of
which he is speaking, indispensable in every British official; requisites, by the bye, which
his friend the Radical possessed in a high degree; but though he bore no ill-will towards his
friend, his friend bore anything but good- will towards him; for from the moment that he had
obtained the appointment for himself, his mind was filled with the most bitter malignity against
the writer, and naturally enough; for no one ever yet behaved in a base manner towards another,
without forthwith conceiving a mortal hatred against him.  You wrong another, know yourself
to have acted basely, and are enraged, not against yourself--for no one hates himself--but
against the innocent cause of your baseness; reasoning very plausibly, "But for that fellow,
I should never have been base; for had he not existed I could not have been so, at any rate
against him;" and this hatred is all the more bitter, when you reflect that you have been needlessly
base.

Whilst the Tories are in power the writer's friend, of his own accord, raves against the Tories
because they do not give the writer a certain appointment, and makes, or says he makes, desperate
exertions to make them do so; but no sooner are the Tories out, with whom he has no influence,
and the Whigs in, with whom he, or rather his party, has influence, than he gets the place
for himself, though, according to his own expressed opinion--an opinion with which the writer
does not, and never did, concur--the writer was the only person competent to hold it. Now had
he, without saying a word to the writer, or about the writer with respect to the employment,
got the place for himself when he had an opportunity, knowing, as he very well knew, himself
to be utterly unqualified for it, the transaction, though a piece of jobbery, would not have
merited the title of a base transaction; as the matter stands, however, who can avoid calling
the whole affair not only a piece of--come, come, out with the word--scoundrelism on the part
of the writer's friend, but a most curious piece of uncalled-for scoundrelism? and who, with
any knowledge of fallen human nature, can wonder at the writer's friend entertaining towards
him a considerable portion of gall and malignity?

This feeling on the part of the writer's friend was wonderfully increased by the appearance
of Lavengro, many passages of which the Radical in his foreign appointment applied to himself
and family--one or two of his children having gone over to Popery, the rest become members
of Mr. Platitude's chapel, and the minds of all being filled with ultra notions of gentility.

The writer, hearing that his old friend had returned to England, to apply, he believes, for
an increase of salary, and for a title, called upon him, unwillingly, it is true, for he had
no wish to see a person for whom, though he bore him no ill-will, he could not avoid feeling
a considerable portion of contempt; the truth is, that his sole object in calling was to endeavour
to get back a piece of literary property which his friend had obtained from him many years
previously, and which, though he had frequently applied for it, he never could get back.  Well,
the writer called; he did not get his property, which, indeed, he had scarcely time to press
for, being almost instantly attacked by his good friend and his wife--yes, it was then that
the author was set upon by an old Radical and his wife--the wife, who looked the very image
of shame and malignity, did not say much, it is true, but encouraged her husband in all he
said.  Both of their own accord introduced the subject of Lavengro.  The Radical called the
writer a grumbler, just as if there had ever been a greater grumbler than himself until, by
the means above described, he had obtained a place: he said that the book contained a melancholy
view of human nature--just as if anybody could look in his face without having a melancholy
view of human nature.  On the writer quietly observing that the book contained an exposition
of his principles, the pseudo-Radical replied, that he cared nothing for his principles--which
was probably true, it not being likely that he would care for another person's principles after
having shown so thorough a disregard for his own.  The writer said that the book, of course,
would give offence to humbugs; the Radical then demanded whether he thought him a humbug?--the
wretched wife was the Radical's protection, even as he knew she would be; it was on her account
that the writer did not kick his good friend; as it was, he looked at him in the face and thought
to himself, "How is it possible I should think you a humbug, when only last night I was taking
your part in a company in which everybody called you a humbug?"

The Radical, probably observing something in the writer's eye which he did not like, became
all on a sudden abjectly submissive, and, professing the highest admiration for the writer,
begged him to visit him in his government; this the writer promised faithfully to do, and he
takes the present opportunity of performing his promise.

This is one of the pseudo-Radical calumniators of Lavengro and its author; were the writer
on his deathbed he would lay his hand on his heart and say, that he does not believe that there
is one trait of exaggeration in the portrait which he has drawn.  This is one of the pseudo-Radical
calumniators of Lavengro and its author; and this is one of the genus, who, after having railed
against jobbery for perhaps a quarter of a century, at present batten on large official salaries
which they do not earn.  England is a great country, and her interests require that she should
have many a well-paid official both at home and abroad; but will England long continue a great
country if the care of her interests, both at home and abroad, is in many instances intrusted
to beings like him described above, whose only recommendation for an official appointment was
that he was deeply versed in the secrets of his party and of the Whigs?

Before he concludes, the writer will take the liberty of saying of Lavengro that it is a book
written for the express purpose of inculcating virtue, love of country, learning, manly pursuits,
and genuine religion, for example, that of the Church of England, and for awakening a contempt
for nonsense of every kind, and a hatred for priestcraft, more especially that of Rome.

And in conclusion, with respect to many passages of his book in which he has expressed himself
in terms neither measured nor mealy, he will beg leave to observe, in the words of a great
poet, who lived a profligate life, it is true, but who died a sincere penitent--thanks, after
God, to good Bishop Burnet--

   "All this with indignation I have hurl'd
   At the pretending part of this proud world,
   Who, swollen with selfish vanity, devise
   False freedoms, formal cheats, and holy lies,
   Over their fellow fools to tyrannize."

{4}  Genteel with them seems to be synonymous with Gentile and Gentoo; if so, the manner in
which it has been applied for ages ceases to surprise, for genteel is heathenish.  Ideas of
barbaric pearl and gold, glittering armour, plumes, tortures, blood-shedding, and lust, should
always be connected with it.  Wace, in his grand Norman poem, calls the Baron genteel:--

   "La furent li gentil Baron," etc.

And he certainly could not have applied the word better than to the strong Norman thief, armed
cap-a-pie, without one particle of truth or generosity; for a person to be a pink of gentility,
that is heathenism, should have no such feelings; and, indeed, the admirers of gentility seldom
or never associate any such feelings with it.  It was from the Norman, the worst of all robbers
and miscreants, who built strong castles, garrisoned them with devils, and tore out poor wretches'
eyes, as the Saxon Chronicle says, that the English got their detestable word genteel.  What
could ever have made the English such admirers of gentility, it would be difficult to say;
for, during three hundred years, they suffered enough by it.  Their genteel Norman landlords
were their scourgers, their torturers, the plunderers of their homes, the dishonourers of their
wives, and the deflourers of their daughters. Perhaps, after all, fear is at the root of the
English veneration for gentility.

{5}  Gentle and gentlemanly may be derived from the same root as genteel; but nothing can be
more distinct from the mere genteel, than the ideas which enlightened minds associate with
these words.  Gentle and gentlemanly mean something kind and genial; genteel, that which is
glittering or gaudy.  A person can be a gentleman in rags, but nobody can be genteel.

{6}  The writer has been checked in print by the Scotch with being a Norfolk man.  Surely,
surely, these latter times have not been exactly the ones in which it was expedient for Scotchmen
to check the children of any county in England with the place of their birth, more especially
those who have had the honour of being born in Norfolk--times in which British fleets, commanded
by Scotchmen, have returned laden with anything but laurels from foreign shores.  It would
have been well for Britain had she had the old Norfolk man to dispatch to the Baltic or the
Black sea, lately, instead of Scotch admirals.

{7}  As the present work will come out in the midst of a vehement political contest, people
may be led to suppose that the above was written expressly for the time.  The writer therefore
begs to state that it was written in the year 1854.  He cannot help adding that he is neither
Whig, Tory, nor Radical, and cares not a straw what party governs England, provided it is governed
well.  But he has no hopes of good government from the Whigs.  It is true that amongst them
there is one very great man, Lord Palmerston, who is indeed the sword and buckler, the chariots
and the horses of the party; but it is impossible for his lordship to govern well with such
colleagues as he has--colleagues which have been forced upon him by family influence, and who
are continually pestering him into measures anything but conducive to the country's honour
and interest.  If Palmerston would govern well, he must get rid of them; but from that step,
with all his courage and all his greatness, he will shrink.  Yet how proper and easy a step
it would be!  He could easily get better, but scarcely worse, associates.  They appear to have
one object in view, and only one--jobbery.  It was chiefly owing to a most flagitious piece
of jobbery, which one of his lordship's principal colleagues sanctioned and promoted, that
his lordship experienced his late parliamentary disasters.
