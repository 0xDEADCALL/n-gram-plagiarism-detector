These selections have been made as a result of more than twenty-five years of observation and
study. The text is that of the Bible itself, but in the language of the child, so that it may
easily be read to the younger children and by those who are older. It is not in words of one
syllable, for while the child is reading the Bible he should gradually learn the meaning of
new words and idioms.

The Bible contains the foundations on which the religious life of the child must be built.
The immortal stories and songs of the Old and New Testaments are his richest inheritance from
the past. To give him this heritage in language and form that he can understand and enjoy is
the duty and privilege of his parents and teachers.

It is hoped that "The Children's Bible" will meet the need and the demand, which parents and
educators alike have long felt and often expressed, for a simple translation of selections
from the Bible most suited to the needs and the interests of the child. It is also believed
that after the child has learned to appreciate and love these stories and songs, he will be
eager and able to read the Bible as a whole with genuine interest and understanding.

  "O Little Town of Bethlehem" And
there was an evening and a morning, making the first day.

And God said, "Let there be a sky and let it divide the waters that are below from the waters
that are above the sky." And it was done. And God called the sky the Heavens. And there was
an evening and a morning, making the second day. And God saw that it was good.

And God said, "Let plants and trees grow from the earth." And it was done. And plants and trees
grew from the earth, each plant bringing forth its own kind of seed and each tree its own kind
of fruit, and God saw that it was good. And there was an evening and a morning, making the
third day.

And God said, "Let there be lights in the heavens to separate the night from the day. Let them
be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and the years. God made the stars also and placed them
in the heavens to throw light upon the earth. And God saw that it was good. And there was an
evening and a morning, making the fourth day.

And God said, "Let the waters bring forth many living creatures and let birds fly above the
earth and in the sky." And God made large sea-monsters and all kinds of living creatures with
which the waters abound, and all kinds of birds. And God saw that it was good. And he blessed
them, saying, "Increase and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds increase on the
earth." And there was an evening and a morning, making the fifth day.

And God said, "Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living creatures, cattle and creeping
things and wild beasts." And it was done. So God made all the different kinds of wild beasts,
and the cattle, and everything that crawls upon the ground. And God saw that it was good.

And God said, "Let us make man like ourselves. Let him rule over the fish in the sea, the birds
of the sky, the cattle, the wild beasts and all the living things that crawl upon the ground."
And God made man like himself, like God he made him. He made them male and female.

And God said, "See, to you I give every plant which grows on all the earth, and every tree
which bears fruit with its own kind of seed. It shall be food for you. And to every wild beast
and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that crawls on the earth and is alive, I give
every green herb for food." And it was done.

And when God saw everything that he had made, he saw that it was very good. And there was an
evening and a morning, making the sixth day.

And the heavens and the earth were finished and all that there was in them. And on the seventh
day when God had finished the work which he had done, he rested from all his work.

GOD'S GOOD GIFTS TO MAN

At the time when Jehovah made earth and heaven, no trees or plants grew on the earth, for Jehovah
had not yet sent the rain; and there was no man to till the soil; but a mist rose from the
earth and watered the ground.

Then Jehovah made man out of dust taken from the ground and breathed into him the breath of
life; and man became a living being. And Jehovah planted a garden in Eden, far in the East;
and out of the ground he made grow all kinds of trees that are pleasant to look at and good
for food, also the tree of life and the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil.

Then Jehovah took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and to care for it.
And Jehovah gave the man this command: "You may eat all you wish from every tree of the garden,
except from the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil; from this you shall not eat,
for if you eat from it you shall surely die."

Then Jehovah said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make a companion for him."
So out of the ground Jehovah made all the wild beasts and birds, and brought them to the man
to see what he would name them; and whatever he called each living thing that became its name.
But for the man himself there was found no companion suited to him.

Then Jehovah made the man fall into a deep sleep; and while he slept, he took one of his ribs
and closed up its place with flesh. The rib which he had taken from the man, Jehovah made into
a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said, "Because she was made from my body,
she shall be called Woman."

And Jehovah called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?" and he answered, "I heard the
sound of thy footsteps in the garden and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself."
Jehovah said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I
forbade you to eat?" The man answered, "The woman whom thou didst give to me--she gave me fruit
from the tree and I ate." Jehovah said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The
woman replied, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."

Then Jehovah said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you shall be hated more than
all beasts. You shall crawl on your belly and eat dust all your life, and men and serpents
shall always be enemies. They shall bruise your head, and you shall wound them on the heel."

To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your trouble and your pain, and you shall be
subject to your husband, and he shall rule over you."

But to the man he said, "Because you have listened to your wife and have eaten of the tree
from which I forbade you to eat, as long as you live you shall earn a living only by hard work.
By hard work shall you raise food to eat. And you shall die and your body go back to the ground,
for from dust you were made, and to dust you shall return!"

And Jehovah made garments of skins for the man and his wife, and clothed them. And he sent
them out of the garden of Eden to till the ground.

CAIN AND HIS BROTHER ABEL

Adam named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living beings. She had two sons,
Cain and Abel. Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a farmer.

One day Cain brought, as an offering to Jehovah, some fruit and grain that he had grown. Abel,
too, brought some of the best animals of his flock and sacrificed their fat pieces to Jehovah.
Jehovah was pleased with Abel and his offering, but Cain and his offering did not please him.

This made Cain very angry and his face showed it. So Jehovah said to Cain, "Why are you angry
and why do you scowl? If you do what is right and good, will not your offering be accepted?
But if you do wrong, sin crouches like a wild beast at the door and the desire to sin will
overcome you; but you should master it."

Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let us go into the field." And while they were in the field,
Cain struck his brother Abel and killed him.

When Jehovah said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" Cain answered, "I do not know; am
I my brother's keeper?" Jehovah said, "What have you done? Hark! your brother's blood is crying
to me from the ground.

Then Cain said to Jehovah, "My punishment is more than I can bear. See, thou hast driven me
out to-day from this land, and I shall no longer be able to worship thee; I shall become a
tramp and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."

But Jehovah said to him, "If any one kills you, he shall be punished sevenfold." So Jehovah
placed a mark on Cain, to keep any one who found him from killing him. And Cain went out from
Jehovah's presence and lived as a wanderer, away from Eden.

NOAH AND THE GREAT FLOOD

When Jehovah saw that men were growing more wicked in the world and that their thoughts were
always evil, he was greatly grieved and regretted that he had made man. Therefore, Jehovah
said, "I will completely destroy all living beings from off the earth, for I regret that I
have made them."

But Noah had won Jehovah's favor. So Jehovah said to Noah, "I have decided to put an end to
all living beings, for the earth is filled with their wicked acts. I am going to destroy them
from the earth. Make yourself an ark of cypress wood. Build rooms in the ark, and cover it
within and without with pitch. This is how you shall build it: the ark shall be five hundred
feet long, eighty feet wide, and fifty feet high. Make a roof for it and place the door on
the side. Build it with lower, second, and third stories. For I am about to bring floods of
water upon the earth to destroy every living creature in which is the breath of life. Every
creature that is on the earth shall die."

Then Jehovah said to Noah, "Enter with all your household into the ark, for I see that of all
the people who are now alive you alone are upright. Of all the beasts that are fit for food
and sacrifice you shall take with you seven, the male and the female; but of the beasts that
are not fit for food and sacrifice two, the male and the female; and of the wild birds that
are fit for food and sacrifice seven, to keep each kind alive on all the earth.

Then Noah did all that Jehovah commanded him. When the waters of the flood came upon the earth,
he, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, together with the beasts that were fit for food
and sacrifice and the beasts that were not fit, and the birds, and everything that creeps upon
the ground, entered the ark because of the waters of the flood.

The rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and Jehovah shut Noah in the ark.
And the waters rose higher and higher and raised up the ark, and it was lifted high above the
earth. All creatures living on the land died. Noah only was left and they who were with him
in the ark.

Then God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the animals that were with him in the ark.
And God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the flood went down, the rain from heaven
ceased, and the waters withdrew more and more from the land.

After forty days Noah opened the window of the ark and sent out a raven; and it kept going
to and fro until the waters were dried up on the earth. He also sent out a dove to see if the
waters had gone from the surface of the earth. But the dove found no rest for her foot, and
so returned to him to the ark, for the waters covered the whole earth. Therefore, Noah reached
out his hand and took her and brought her back into the ark.

Then he waited seven days longer and again sent out the dove from the ark. And the dove came
in to him at dusk; and in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive-leaf. So Noah knew that the
waters had gone from the earth. And he waited seven days more and again sent out the dove,
but it did not return to him.

So Noah took off the covering of the ark and looked and saw that the surface of the ground
was dry. Then he, with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, went out of the ark.

And Noah built an altar to Jehovah and took one of every beast and bird that was fit for sacrifice
and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. And Jehovah said to himself, "I will never again
condemn the ground because of man, nor will I again destroy every living creature, as I have done.

THE STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL

All the people of the earth spoke one language; and as they travelled westward, they found
a broad valley in the land of Babylonia, and made their home there.

Then they said one to another, "Come, let us make bricks and thoroughly bake them." So they
had bricks for stone and asphalt for mortar. And they said, "Come, let us build us a city,
and a tower whose top will touch the heavens, and thus make a landmark, that we may not be
scattered over all the earth."

But when Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower men had built, he said, "See, they
are one people and all have one language. This is but the beginning, and now nothing which
they plan to do will seem too difficult for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language,
that they may not understand one another."

So Jehovah scattered them from there over all the earth; and they stopped building the city.
Therefore they named it Babel, which means Confusion, for there Jehovah confused the language
of all the people on the earth and scattered them over the whole world.

ABRAHAM, THE FRIEND OF GOD AND MAN

The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. Terah, a descendant of
Shem, was the father of Abraham, Nahor and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot. And all
the families of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like your own."

So Abraham set out, as Jehovah had commanded him; and Lot went with him. Abraham was seventy-five
years old when he left Haran. He took Sarah his wife and Lot his brother's son and everything
that they had, and started for the land of Canaan.
