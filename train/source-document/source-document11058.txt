Finally, we note that there are innumerable classifications of complementary trades which are,
of course, eminently suited to co-operative advertising. We append two samples of what may
be done in this direction.

                          I.

      As Omar Khayyam said:--

    "A Loaf of Bread--"
           "MONKEY-NUTTO-BRAN"
      Contains the whole of the husk.

    "A Flask of Wine--"
             A Wise Host
           PLUMES HIMSELF
                on his
          CHÂTEAU VINAIGRETTE.

    "A Book of Verse--"
            "PURPLE PIFFLE."

    "No submarines were sighted, but the vessel's commander steered a
    tortoise course through the danger zone."--Newfoundland Paper.

Far, far better than turning turtle.

    "Metra laughed and deposited herself bewitchingly among the cushions on
    the davenport."--London Magazine.

Personally, we prefer a roll on the top of an American desk.

    "By Regulation 35B of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, it is an
    offence for any person having found any bomb, or projectile, or any
    fragment thereof, or any document, map, &c., which may have been
    discharged, dropped, &c., from any hostile aircraft, to forthwith
    communicate the fact to a Military Post or to a Police Constable in the
    neighbourhood."--Scotsman.

Why this mistrust of Scottish policemen?

EARLIER FOOD PROBLEMS.

Peace, I remember, had her alimentary perplexities not much less renowned than war. At any
rate I can think of two.

The first was some years ago, in Yorkshire, on one of those sultry and stifling days of August
which in winter, or even in such a March as we have been suffering, one can view as something
more desirable than rubies, but which in actual fact are depressing, enervating, and the mother
of moodiness and fatigue. We had left Chop Yat early in the morning after a night of excessive
heat in beds of excessive featheriness and were walking towards Helmsley by way of Rievaulx,
all unconcerned as to lunch by the way, because the ordnance map marked with such cordial legibility
an inn on the road at a reasonable distance. Moreover, was not Yorkshire made up of hospitable
ridings, and had we not, on the previous day, found lunch in this cottage and tea in that,
with no trouble at all, to say nothing of the terrific spread confronting us at Chop Yat? Why
then carry anything?

But we soon began to regret the absence of sustenance, for this kind of weather makes for extreme
lassitude shot through with rattiness, and under its influence nourishment dies in one with
painful celerity.
