INTRODUCTION.

Lewis Holberg, the author of the Narrative of Niels Klim, was the most eminent writer among
the Danes in the eighteenth century. His works show a surprising versatility of genius, comprising
Histories and Treatises on Jurisprudence, together with Satires and Comedies. He was by birth
a Norwegian, but was educated at the University at Copenhagen in Denmark. Soon after receiving
a theological degree from that Institution, he visited Holland and England, and resided about
two years at Oxford. Shortly after his return he published an "Introduction to European History,"
and an "Appendix to the Universal History," in which he gives an account of contemporaneous
affairs in the principal governments of the world. His historical labors were interrupted by
a royal appointment to a professorship in the University. This office he enjoyed for five years,
and then went abroad. In his Autobiography he has given an interesting account of his travels,
both at this time and subsequently, and has described men and manners in a way highly entertaining,
and generally just. He visited most of the cities of Southern Europe, abiding some time in
each. He was well received by men of letters, and made many valuable acquaintance, wherever
he went. After remaining one whole winter at Rome, and accomplishing the object of his mission,
he returned to Copenhagen. His income was now small, and for two years he was oppressed with
great pecuniary difficulties. It was during this period that he published in the Danish language,
his "Introduction to the Law of Nature and of Nations." In this treatise, Holberg aimed rather
to apply the principles of Natural Law to the Laws and Constitutions of Norway and Denmark,
than elaborately to discuss the principles themselves. The work was coldly received at its
first appearance, but, after ten or twelve years began to excite public attention, and passed
through several editions.

At length, the professorship of metaphysics becoming vacant, he received the appointment. The
emoluments of this office, though small, supplied his necessities, and, not long after, on
obtaining a more lucrative station in the University, he was relieved from his embarrassments.

Hitherto, he had devoted himself almost exclusively to Jurisprudence, History and Languages,
and had never tried his hand at poetical composition. Indeed, he had ever felt a strange aversion
to the study of poetry, and, although he had read the Latin Poets, and composed Latin Poems,
it was more for the sake of proficiency in the language, than for pleasure, or, in his own
words, "as a sick man swallows bitter draughts, not because they are grateful to the palate,
but, because they are recommended by the physicians."

He now, however, seemed inspired by a new ambition, and set himself to imitate one of Juvenal's
Satires. Encouraged by his unexpected facility, he projected and composed an original poem.
Its success, when published, surpassed that of any work previously written in the Danish language.
Judicious critics heartily commended it, and some even looked upon it as introducing a new
era in the national literature. It was also published in Sweden and Germany, and raised the
author's reputation abroad. He next published five more Satires, prefixing to each a short
preface, unfolding the writer's design. His poetical productions were a source of more honor
than gain, and, becoming weary of almost profitless pursuits, he abandoned poetry, and devoted
himself to his former studies.

Nevertheless, the solicitations of friends prevailed upon him to turn his attention to Dramatic
composition. Here he was equally successful. His comedies were received with great applause,
and still hold possession of the stage. Like his Satires, they were intended to expose fashionable
vice and folly. They are twenty-five in number. The names of several will give some notion
of their general character--The Babbling Barber; Always Busy and Doing Nothing; The Treacherous
Step-father; The Political Tinman.

His health being impaired by unintermitted literary labor, he determined to seek relief from
the baths of Aix-la-Chapelle. He did not derive from them the benefit he anticipated, but,
after spending the winter in Paris, returned home with renewed health and spirits. His next
publication, was a Satirical Poem, entitled "Metamorphosis," in which brutes and trees are
transformed into men. This was the last of his poetical efforts.

For several years he had been engaged in preparing "A General Ecclesiastical History from the
origin of Christianity to the Reformation of Luther," which he now published. This production,
the author affirms, was written with perfect impartiality. He sometimes censured the Fathers,
praised heretics, when they deserved it, and occasionally even commended the Popes. It was
extremely popular, though all were not pleased with its liberal spirit. A Comparative Biography
of Asiatic and Indian Heroes, after Plutarch's style; A short Historical Account of his Native
Town; The Narrative of Niels Klim; His Autobiography; and a History of the Jewish Nation, digested
from the works of Josephus, Prideaux, and Basnage, close the list of his works.

"The Journey to the World under ground," or "Narrative of Niels Klim," had been written for
a long time, but he had refrained from printing it from an unwillingness to provoke enmity.
But the importunity of friends, and the generous offer of a bookseller finally prevailed, and
he put it into the printer's hands. The following account of this performance is abridged from
his autobiography.

There are many persons of both sexes in my country, who believe in fairies and supernatural
beings, and who are ready to swear, that they have been conveyed by spirits to hills and mountain
caves. This superstition is ridiculed in Klim, the hero of the tale. He is supposed to be transported
to the world under ground, where he meets with some surprising adventures. Many strange creatures
inhabit this new world; trees, for instance, are introduced, endowed with speech, and musical
instruments discuss questions of philosophy and finance. Amongst the characters, those geniuses,
who perceive everything at a glance, but penetrate nothing, are conspicuous. People of quick
perception, whom we use to admire, are despised by the Potuans, who look upon them as idle
loungers, that, though always moving, make no progress. Prudent men, on the contrary, who measure
their own strength, and advance cautiously, are greatly esteemed by that nation, though with
us they pass for fools or cowards. The Potuans and Martinians are examples of both these extremes.
By the former Klim was considered a blockhead, on account of the quickness of his perceptions;
by the latter he was equally despised for the slowness of his apprehension. To Klim, who measures
virtues and vices by the ordinary standard, everything is a paradox; but what he at first condemns,
he admires and extols after deliberation; so that the object of the whole work is to correct
popular errors, and to distinguish the semblance of virtue and vice from the reality. Its subordinate
design is to expose the monstrous fictions, which some authors obtrude upon us in their descriptions
of remote countries.

"The Narrative of Niels Klim," though written so many years ago, contains many satirical hits,
exceedingly applicable to the present time; thus showing that what appears to one age to be
a whim altogether new, may be, in fact, only some old notion newly promulgated. Greater liberties
were allowed at that period in literature than would now be permitted. Holberg's humorous productions
are not wholly free from a fault, whose existence the taste of any age may explain, but does
not excuse.

After living in competency for many years in Copenhagen, he was, in 1747, created a baron by
the king of Denmark. He died in 1754.

APOLOGETIC PREFACE.

PETER KLIM AND ANDREAS KLIM, THE SONS OF THOMAS KLIM, AND GRANDSONS OF KLIM THE GREAT, TO THE
KIND READER.

Since it has come to our ears that some persons have doubted the truth of this story, and that,
consequently, the publisher of the subterranean voyage has gotten, here and there, a bad reputation,
we have, to prevent all false accusations, held it advisable to prefix to this new edition
certificates from men whose honesty and sincerity are raised above all distrust, and whose
evidence will secure the publisher against all opposition. The first two of these witnesses
we know to have been contemporary with our hero; the rest flourished at a period immediately
subsequent; and all are generally known as people venerable in virtue and honesty, whose cool
and sound judgments effectually preclude the blandishments of cajolery, while their noble candor
and undeviating uprightness forbid the sanction of their names to whatever is, in its nature,
deceitful or fictitious. With the testimony of such respectable persons, we shall bind the
tongues of all false, prejudiced and sneering critics, and, before these signatures, oblige
them to acknowledge their folly and take back their heedless accusations. The certificate sent
to my brother and myself reads thus:

     "At the desire of the estimable and much respected young
     men, PETER KLIM and ANDREAS KLIM, we, the undersigned, do
     certify, that among the books and papers left by the
     celebrated NIELS KLIM, we have seen a manuscript, with the
     title, 'Subterranean Voyage.' To the same 'Voyage' were
     added a subterranean Grammar and Dictionary, in two
     languages, namely, Danish and Quamitic. By comparing the
     celebrated Abelin's Latin translation with this old
     manuscript, we find that the former does not, in the least
     point, deviate from the hand-text. To its further
     confirmation we have hereby placed our seals.

     ADRIAN PETERSON, MPP.
     JENS THORLAKSEN, MPP.
     SVEND KLAK, MPP.
     JOKUM BRANDER, MPP.
     JENS GAD, (for self and brother,) MPP.
     HIERONYMOUS GIBS, (Scotch,) MPP."

We hope by such distinguished and authentic testimony to remove all doubt; but should there
be found any stubborn enough to persist in their suspicions, in spite of these certificates,
we will anticipate their objections, and endeavor to subdue their incredulity with other weapons.

It is a known fact, that in a section of Norway, called Finnmark, exist people who have advanced
so far in the study and practice of natural witchcraft, (a science into which other nations
have scarcely looked,) that they can excite and subdue storms; transform themselves to wolves;
speak several, and in our world entirely unknown, languages; and travel from the north to the
south pole in less time than one hour. One of these Finns, by name Peyvis, came lately to Bergen,
and exhibited so many strange proofs of his art and science, that all present deemed him worthy
of a doctor's hat: at the same time a fierce critic came out with a review of the "Subterranean
Travels," which he assumptively tagged to the long list of "old women's stories;" the honor
of the Klims being thus impugned, and his own by implication, Peyvis, through our influence,
obtained permission to collect materials and prepare himself for a voyage under ground. He
commenced by publishing a card, wherein he exalted his abilities in the following expressions:

        What will you? say!
    From northern ice to southern land:
    From eastern isles to western sand,
    Spirits of earth, spirits of air;
    Spirits foul and spirits fair,
        My power obey!
    I break the rainbow's arched line;
    That herald of approaching calm.
    Thunder I send by cold moonshine,--
    Mine is the bane and mine the balm.
    My beck upwhirls the hurricane:
    The sun and moon and stars in vain
    Their wonted course would keep;
    Honey from out the rock doth weep
        When I command.
        My potent wand,
    Stretched on the mighty northern wave,
    Or seas that farther India lave,
    Subdues their mountain billows hoarse,
    To inland brooklets' murmuring course.
    What is on earth, what is in sea,
    In air and fire, from Peyvis free?

Everybody shuddered from fear at hearing these incredible assumptions. The Finn immediately
prepared himself for the voyage, undressed, and, strange sight! suddenly transformed to an
eagle, raised himself into the air and soon vanished. After a full month's absence, our wonderful
doctor, early on a morning, re-appeared, entirely exhausted, his forehead streaming with sweat.
When sufficiently recovered from his fatigue, he commenced a description of his adventures
on his air passage and in the subterranean lands. He told us that on his arrival below, war
was raging between the established government and the opposition, in which the party of Klim
got the ascendancy, and reinstated the son of our Niels on the throne; our kinsman had for
a long time borne the sceptre, under the administration of his mother; but now, old and glorified
for many great feats, reigned alone over the whole subterranean world, with the name of Niels
the Second.

Now, take shame to yourselves, ye incredulous mortals! and learn hereafter, in important matters,
to proceed with more caution. Be ashamed, ye scoffers! and ask pardon for your unfounded accusations,
your atrocious sneers. Stand abashed, finally, ye hyper-critics! and know that the learned
world shall no longer suffer from your audacious and unreasonable judgments; then silence your
stunted progeny at their birth, or if you will, yourselves!

CHAPTER I.

THE AUTHOR'S DESCENT TO THE ABYSS.

In the year 1664, after graduating at the Academy of Copenhagen, in Theology and Philosophy,
I prepared to return to my father-land, and took passage in a ship bound for the city of Bergen,
in Norway. I had been furnished with brilliant testimonials from both faculties, and wanted
only money;--a fate common to Norwegian students, who generally return home with empty purses
from the Temple of the Muses.

We had a good wind, and in three days arrived at my native town, Bergen.

I occupied myself now, in expanding my knowledge of natural philosophy, and for practice, geologically
examined the neighboring mountains. On the top of the most interesting of these mountains,
(interesting I mean to a student,) was a remarkable cave, which the inhabitants of the town
called Florien. From its mouth, a mild and not unpleasant air issues at certain periods, as
though the cave inhaled the breeze and gently sighed it forth again.

The learned in Bergen, especially the celebrated Abelin and Edward, had longed to examine it;
but these latter, from their great age, being unable to perform so arduous a feat, used every
occasion to induce the young and adventurous to attempt the exploration. Instigated, (and it
was a foolish, and I might say, a wicked resolution,) instigated, I say, not less by the encouragement
of these great men than by my own inclination, I determined to descend into the cave. The longer
I thought of the matter, the firmer I became. I prepared every thing needful for the expedition,
and on a Thursday, at the morning twilight, departed from the city. I started thus early, because
I desired to finish my labors before dark, and make a report the same evening.

How little did I then dream that like another Phaëton, I should be driven headlong through
the air and precipitated to another globe, there to ramble for the space of ten years, before
I should see my friends and native land again. The expedition took place in the year 1665.
Accompanied by four men to carry the necessary implements, and assist in letting me down, I
ascended the mountain. Arrived at the top, near the fatal cave, we sat down to breakfast. Now,
for the first time, my heart began to faint, as though it foreboded my coming misfortune; but,
in a moment, my half extinguished courage blazed again. I fixed a rope around my body, stood
on the edge of the cave, and commended my soul to God. Ordering the men to veer the rope steadily,
and to hold when I cried out, I took a boat-hook in my right hand, and glided into the abyss.
Aided by the pole, I was enabled to keep clear of the jutting points of rock that would have
impeded my progress, as well as have wounded me. I was somewhat anxious about the rope, for
it rubbed hard against the rocks at the top; and, in fact, I had scarcely descended twenty
to thirty feet, when it gave way, and I tumbled with strange quickness down the abyss, armed
like Pluto, with a boat-hook, however, in place of a sceptre.

Enveloped by thick darkness, I had been falling about a quarter of an hour, when I observed
a faint light, and soon after a clear and bright-shining heaven. I thought, in my agitation,
that some counter current of air had blown me back to earth. The sun, moon and stars, appeared
so much smaller here than to people on the surface, that I was at a loss with regard to my
where-a-bout.

I concluded that I must have died, and that my spirit was now about to be carried to the blessed
dwellings. I immediately conceived the folly of this conclusion, however, when I found myself
armed with a boat-hook, and dragging behind me a long strip of rope; well knowing that neither
of these were needful to land me in Paradise, and that the celestial citizens would scarcely
approve of these accessories, with which I appeared, in the manner of the giants of old, likely
to attack heaven and eject the gods therefrom.

Finally, a new light glimmered in my brain. I must have got into the subterranean firmament.
This conclusion decided the opinion of those, who insist that the earth is hollow, and that
within its shell there is another, lesser world, with corresponding suns, planets, stars, &c.,
to be well-grounded. The result proved that I guessed right.

The rapidity of my descent, continually augmented for a long time, now began to decrease gradually.
I was approaching a planet which I had from the first seen directly before me. By degrees it
grew larger and larger, when, penetrating the thick atmosphere which surrounded it, I plainly
saw seas, mountains and dales on its surface.

    As the bold bird, between the billow's top
    And mountain's summit, sweeps around
    The muscle-clothed rock, and with light wing
    Sports on the foam, my body hovered.

I found now that I did not hang in the atmosphere, buoyed up by the strong current of which
I have spoken, but that the perpendicular line of my descent was changed to a circle. I will
not deny that my hair rose up on my head in fear. I knew not but that I might be metamorphosed
to a planet or to a satellite; to be turned around in an eternal whirl. Yet my courage returned,
as I became somewhat accustomed to the motion. The wind was gentle and refreshing. I was but
little hungry or thirsty; but recollecting there was a small cake in my pocket, I took it out
and tasted it. The first mouthful, however, was disagreeable, and I threw it from me. The cake
not only remained in the air, but to my great astonishment, began to circle about me. I obtained
at this time a knowledge of the true law of motion, which is, that all bodies, when well balanced,
must move in a circle.

I remained in the orbit in which I was at first thrown three days. As I continually moved about
the planet nearest to me, I could easily distinguish between night and day; for I could see
the subterranean sun ascend and descend--the night, however, did not bring with it darkness
as it does with us. I observed, that on the descent of the sun, the whole heavens became illuminated
with a peculiar and very bright light. This, I ascribed to the reflection of the sun from the
internal arch of the earth.

But just as I began to fancy myself in the near presence of the immortal gods, about to become
myself a new heavenly light and wondered at as a brilliant star--behold! a horrible, winged
monster appeared, who seemed to threaten me with instant destruction. When I saw this object
in the distance I supposed it to be one of the celestial signs, but when it came near I perceived
it to be an enormous eagle, which followed in my wake as if about to pounce upon me. I observed
that this creature noticed me particularly, but could not determine whether as a friend or enemy.

Had I reflected, I should not have wondered that a human being, swinging round in the air,
with a boat-hook in his hand, and a long rope dragging behind him, like a tail, should attract
the attention of even a brute creature.

My uncommon figure gave, as I afterwards understood, occasion for strange reports to the inhabitants
on my side of the planet.

The astronomers regarded me as a comet, with a very long tail. The superstitious thought my
appearance to be significant of some coming misfortune. Some draughtsmen took my figure, as
far as they could descry it, so that when I landed I found paintings of myself, and engravings
taken from them, and hawked about.

But to return; the eagle flew towards me and attacked me with his wings very furiously. I defended
myself as well as I could with my boat-hook, and even vigorously, considering my unstable situation.
At last, when he attempted to grapple with me, I thrust the hook in between his wings so firmly
that I could not extricate it.

The wounded monster fell, with a terrible cry, to the globe beneath; and holding the hook,
I, well tired of my pendant attitude, was dragged to the planet.

At first my descent was violent, but the increasing thickness of the atmosphere as I approached
the planet, made me sink with an easy and soft fall to the earth. Immediately on touching it
the eagle died of its wounds.

It was now night; or rather the sun was down, for it was not dark. I could see clearly to read
the papers I had in my pocket.

The light, as I have already said, comes from the firmament or internal shell of our earth,
half of it being brightened at one time like our moon. The only difference between night and
day is that the absence of the sun makes the weather a little colder.

CHAPTER II.

THE AUTHOR'S ARRIVAL AT THE PLANET NAZAR.

My voyage through the air was now ended. I lay for a long time entirely immovable, awaiting
my fate with the approach of day. I now observed that the wants and weaknesses of humanity,
which, during my passage had ceased, now returned. I was both sleepy and hungry. Fatigued in
mind and body I fell into a deep slumber. I had slept, as far as I could judge, about two hours,
when a terrible roar, which had previously disturbed my slumbers, suddenly waked me. I had
dreamed some curious dreams; in one, I thought myself to be in Norway, at the church in my
native town, listening to the singing of our clerk, whose voice was really unpleasant from
its roughness. My first impression therefore, on recovering myself was, that this man was indulging
in an extraordinarily ambitious strain. In fact, on opening my eyes, I saw a huge bull within
a few feet of me. At the same moment, a vigorous roar from this animal convinced me that I
did not listen to church music.

It was now day-break, and the rising sun began to gild the green oaks and fruitful fields,
which, spreading abroad in every direction, astonished my recovered sense.

How much greater was my surprise when I saw the trees, of which there were great numbers in
my view, move, although not a breeze stirred.

The vicinity of the bull not being pleasing to me, I arose and began to ascend a tree which
stood near. As I raised myself by its limbs, it gave a low, yet shrill scream, and I got at
the same time a lively slap on my ear, which propelled me headlong to the ground. Here I lay
as if struck by lightning, about to give up my spirit, when I heard around me a murmuring noise,
such as is heard on the Exchange when the merchants are assembled.

I opened my eyes and saw many trees moving about the field. Imagine my agitation, when one
of the trees swept towards me, bent one of its branches, and, lifting me from the ground, carried
me off, in spite of my woful cries, followed by an innumerable number of its companions of
all kinds and sizes. From their trunks issued certain articulated sounds, which were entirely
incomprehensible to me, and of which I retained only the words: Pikel-Emi, on account of their
being often repeated. I will here say, these words mean an extraordinary monkey, which creature
they took me to be, from my shape and dress. All this, of course, I learned after being some
months among them.

In my present condition, I was far from being able to conceive of the nature of sensible, speaking
trees. In truth, so confounded was I, that I forgot I could speak myself. As little could I
understand the meaning of the slow, solemn procession, and the confused murmurs which resounded
in the air.

I fancied they were reproaching or expressing their contempt of me. I was not far from the
truth: for the tree into which I had climbed to escape from the bull, was no less than the
wife of the sheriff of the neighboring town, to which they were now taking me a prisoner.

The buildings and streets of this town were very handsome and extensive. The houses, from their
height, appeared like huge towers. The streets were wide and filled with trees, which swayed
about and saluted each other by lowering their branches.

The greater this declination, the more expressive was it of respect and esteem.

As we passed through a very wide street I saw a tall oak approach a distinguished house, when
the trees which escorted me, stepped gracefully back, and bent their branches to the ground.
I concluded this must be a more than common personage. In fact, it was the sheriff himself,
the very dignitary, whose lady it was insisted I had come too near. I was carried to the hall
of this officer's house, and the door was locked upon me. Several trees armed with axes kept
guard over me. The axes were held in the branches, which served the same purpose as human hands.
I noticed that high up in the branches each wore a head, about the size of my own, covered
with leaves and tendrils instead of hair. Below were two roots or legs, very short.

These trees were much smaller than those on our earth, in fact being about the height of a
man; some indeed were much shorter; but these I concluded to be children.

While reflecting on the miserable situation in which I found myself, and weeping over the ill-luck
of my adventure, my guards stepped up to me and commanded me to follow them. They led me to
a splendid building in the middle of the market-place.

At the door of this building stood Justice, cut out in the form of a tree, holding among the
branches a pair of scales. I presumed the structure to be the court-house, nor was I deceived.
I was carried into a large room, the floor of which was overlaid with glittering marble flags
of various colors.

At the upper end a golden chair was raised a little above the floor, like a judge's seat; in
it was seated a sedate palm tree, distinguished from the rest by the gorgeousness of his leaves;
a little below him were seated twelve assessors, six on either side. About them stood twenty-four
officers holding axes. I was not a little terrified when brought a prisoner before these magnates.

As I entered the hall, all the officers of the court stood up, elevated their branches and
then sat down. After this ceremony I was placed at the bar between two trees, the stems of
which were covered with sheep-skins. These persons I supposed to be lawyers, and so they were.

Before the trial commenced, the head of the judge was wrapped up in a black blanket. The accuser
then made a short speech, which he thrice repeated. The lawyer appointed to defend me, replied
in the same manner. A perfect silence then ensued. In half an hour the superior judge rose
from the chair, removed the blanket, raised the branches towards Heaven, and spoke with much
grace, what I supposed to be my sentence. I was then carried back to my prison.

While I mused on the strange things I had witnessed, a tree came into my cell, with an instrument
resembling a lancet in his hand. He stripped one of my arms, and made a puncture in the median
vein. When he had taken from me as much blood as he deemed sufficient, he bound up the wound
with great dexterity. He then examined my blood with much attention, and departed silently,
with an expression of wonder.

This circumstance by no means weakened the opinion which I had for some time entertained, that
these people were shallow and foolish. But my judgment proved to be too hasty. When I was better
enabled to judge of what passed about me, by acquaintance with the subterranean languages,
my contempt was changed to admiration.

I will now explain the ceremonies, which to my ignorance seemed ridiculous.

From my figure it was concluded that I was an inhabitant of the firmament. I was supposed to
have attempted to violate the person of a chaste and virtuous lady, and for this crime I had
been taken to the court-house for trial.

The rising of the branches towards Heaven, was a common ceremony of religion. The lawyers were
clothed in sheep-skin, to remind them of the attributes of their calling--innocence, faithfulness,
and sedateness. The repetition of their speeches was on account of the very slow apprehension
and cautious decision of the people, by which peculiarities they were distinguished from all
the inhabitants of the subterranean world. But what most excited my curiosity was the history
of the supreme judge. This was a virgin, a native of the town, and appointed by the King to
the office of Kaki, or judge, for her superior virtue and talent. It must be observed that
this nation pay no regard to sex in appointments to office, but, after a strict examination,
elect those to take charge of affairs who are proved to be the most worthy.

Seminaries are established throughout the country, to teach the aspirants to public honors
the duties appertaining to the direction of government. The business of the administrators
of these colleges is to search closely into the brains and hearts of the young students, and
when satisfied with their virtue and ability, to give to the king a list of those fully prepared
to fill the public offices. The administrators are called Karatti.

The young virgin of whom I have spoken, had received, four years before from the Karatti, a
certificate for remarkable attainments and virtues, and had been invested with the "blanket."
This blanket was wrapped about her head during my trial; this precaution, however, is taken
only in trials such as mine, in which the occasionally broad nature of the testimony might
have a painful effect upon the virgin judge, should her face be exposed to the public gaze.

The name of this virgin was Palmka. She had officiated for three years with the greatest honor,
and was considered the most learned tree in the city.

She solved with so much discretion the knottiest questions, that her decisions had come to
be regarded as oracles.

    As Themis' self, with scales of equal weight,
    She judged with candor both the small and great:
    The sands of truth she, like the goddess, frees
    From falsehood's glitter and from error's lees.

The following account was given to me of the blood-letting to which I had been subjected. When
any one is proved to be guilty of a crime, he is bled, for the purpose of detecting from the
color of the fluid, or blood, how far his guilt was voluntary or otherwise; whether he had
sinned through malice or distemper. Should the fluid be found discolored, he is sent to the
hospital to be cured; thus this process is rather a correction than a punishment. A member
of the council, or any one high in office, would be removed, should it be found necessary to
bleed him.

The reason why the surgeon, who performed the operation on me, was astonished, was, on account
of the redness of my blood. The inhabitants having a sort of white fluid in their veins, the
purity of which is proportional to their innocence and excellence.

I was put at my ease when I observed that the trees generally possessed a large share of humanity.
This was displayed in their little attentions to me. Food was brought to me twice a day. It
consisted of fruit and several kinds of beans; my drink was a clear, sweet and exceedingly
delicious juice.

The sheriff, in whose house I was imprisoned, had immediately given notice to the King that
he had by accident got possession of a somewhat sensible animal of an uncommon figure. The
description of my person excited the king's curiosity. Orders were given to the sheriff, that
I should be taught the language of the country; on which I should be sent to court. A teacher
was appointed for me, whose instruction enabled me in a half year to speak very comprehensibly.
After this preparatory course of private study, I was sent to the seminary, where particular
care was taken both of my mental and physical education. Indeed, so enthusiastic were they
to naturalize me, that they actually fastened branches to my body to make me look as much as
possible like themselves.

CHAPTER III.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TOWN KEBA.

During the course of my education, my landlord frequently carried me about the town, and pointed
out the most remarkable things. Keba is the town next in size and importance to the capital
of the kingdom of Potu. The inhabitants are distinguished for their sedateness and moderation;
old age is more respected by them than by any other community. They are strangely addicted
to the pitting of animals against each other; or, as they call it, "play fight." I wondered
that so moral a people could enjoy these brutal sports. My landlord noticed my surprise, and
said, that throughout the kingdom it was the custom to vary their lives with a due mixture
of earnest duties and amusing pleasures. Theatrical plays are very much in vogue with them.
I was vexed, however, to hear that disputations are reckoned suitable for the stage, while
with us they are confined to the universities.

At certain times in the year, disputants are set against each other, as we pit dogs and game
cocks. High bets are made in favor of one or the other, and a premium is given to the winner.

Beside these disputants, who are called Masbakki, or boxers, various quadrupeds, wild as well
as tame, are trained to fight as on our globe.

In this town a gymnasium is established, in which the liberal arts are taught with much success.

My landlord carried me, on a high festival day, to this academy. On this occasion a Madic,
or teacher in philosophy, was elected. The candidate made a very prosy speech on some philosophical
question, after which, without farther ceremony, he was entered, by the administrators, on
the list of the public teachers.

On our way home from the academy, we met a criminal, led by three watchmen. By sentence of
the kaki, he had been bled, and was now on his way to the city hospital. I inquired concerning
his crime, and was answered, that he had publicly lectured on the being and qualities of God--a
subject entirely forbidden in this country. Disputants on these matters are regarded as insane,
and are always sent to the mad-house, where they are doctored, until they recover their sound
reason. I exclaimed: Heaven and Earth! how would such laws operate on our globe, where thousands
of priests quarrel every day about the divine attributes, the nature of spirits, and other
secrets of the same character? Truly, here they would all be sent straight-way to the mad-house.
These, among many other singular customs, I observed during my college life. Finally, the time
came when, furnished with appropriate testimonies from the teachers, I was ordered to court.
Here is my certificate. How angry and confused, was I, when I read it:--

     "In accordance with your royal order, we hereby send the
     animal, which sometime since came down to us from the
     firmament; which animal calls itself man. We have, with
     sedulous care and patient industry, taught this singular
     creature in our school, and after a very severe examination,
     pronounce it to be very quick in its perceptions and very
     docile in its manners. Nevertheless, from its obtuse and
     miserable judgment--which we believe arises from its too
     hasty inferences--its ridiculous scepticism on
     unquestionable points, and its no less ridiculous credulity
     on doubtful ones, we may scarcely number it among sensible
     beings. However, as it is far quicker on its legs than any
     of our race, we humbly suggest, that it is very well adapted
     for the situation of a running-camp-footman. Written at our
     Seminary at Keba by your Highness' most humble servants.

     NEHEK, JOKTAN, RAPASI, KILAK."

I returned sorrowfully to my landlord, and begged of him with tears in my eyes, to use his
influence to alter the nature of my certificate from the Karatti, and to show them my testimony
from the academy of Copenhagen, in which I was represented as a remarkable student. He replied
to me, "that this diploma might be well enough in Copenhagen, where probably the shadow was
regarded more than the substance: the bark more than the sap; but here, where the kernel was
more important than aught else, it was of no use."

He counselled me to bear my fate with patience, and assured me, in the politest manner, of
his friendship. Having nothing more to say, I made ready, without delay, for the journey. There
travelled in company with me several small trees, which had been educated with me in the seminary,
and were now destined to the capital for preferment.

Our leader was an old Karatti, who rode on an ox, because from his age he could not walk. Our
progress was very slow, so that three days were occupied in our passage. We had a quick and
comfortable jaunt, if I except the meeting with some wild monkeys, that would spring towards
me, and pester me now and then. They evidently supposed me to be one of their race. I could
not suppress my anger, however, when I observed that the trees seemed to perceive this mistake
of the monkeys, which gave the saplings food for laughter at my expense. I must remark that
I was carried to court in the same dress which I wore on my descent to the planet, with the
boat-hook in my hand and the rope dragging after me. This was by order of the king, who wished
to see me in my own bark.

CHAPTER IV.

THE ROYAL COURT OF POTU.

At last, we entered the large and splendid capital of the kingdom of Potu.

We were first carried to a house, where all students from the country seminaries are received,
for the purpose of refreshment. Here we prepared for an interview with the king. In the mean
time our Karatti, or leader went before to announce us to the court. On his return, we were
all ordered to follow him. On our way to court we met several small trees, with printed stories
in their branches. These were literary hawkers. I accidentally fixed my eye upon the title
of one of these books. It was: "A true account of an entirely new and wonderful meteor, or
flying dragon, which was seen last year in the heavens." I knew this was myself, and therefore
purchased the book, for which three kilak--about two cents--were demanded. On the title page
I found an engraving of myself, as I appeared while hovering over the planet, accompanied by
boat-hook and rope. We now approached the castle, an extensive series of battlements and buildings,
more distinguished for its strength and delicacy of finish than for splendor. It presented
to my view a very singular, and, I may say rural, appearance, from the vast number of trees
on the walls.

It was now noon, and the dinner hour. The king wishing to see me before he dined, I was brought
alone to the dining hall. The king received me very graciously, uniting in a remarkable degree,
while addressing me, mildness of tone with dignity of expression.

At my entrance into the hall, I knelt before the throne: the king demanded the meaning of the
ceremony. Having told him the reason, he remarked, that such worship was due only to the Divinity.
When I had raised myself, he put to me several questions--demanding how I had come down?--the
reason of my journey--my name--where I came from, &c., all which questions I answered truly.
Finally, he inquired concerning my religion, and was evidently much pleased with our creed.
I was ordered to wait till dinner was over. At the table were seated with the King, the Queen,
Prince, and Kadok, or great chancellor. At a certain sign, a maiden tree entered, bearing in
her eight branches, as many dishes, which was the number daily served at the royal table. Another
tree entered with eight bottles, filled with as many different juices. In the dinner conversation,
frequent mention was made of myself.

After dinner, the King ordered me to show my testimony. After reading it, he looked at my legs.
"The Karatti are perfectly right!" said he; "and their advice shall be followed." A Kiva, or
secretary, was now sent for, to enter me, among others, in the royal register of promotion.
This Kiva was a tree of remarkable external appearance; he had eleven branches--a singular
number--and was able to write eleven letters at once. With this tree I afterwards became very
intimate; he wrote all the letters which I, as footman, carried about the country.

On receiving my appointment, I went to bed. Although I was much fatigued, I could not get any
sleep for a long while. However, I fell, at last, into an uneasy slumber, from which I was
suddenly roused by an uncommonly large monkey, which, on opening my eyes, I found playing all
manner of tricks with me, much to the amusement of several young trees, my companions. The
king laughed heartily over the jokes of the monkeys, when they were related to him, but at
the same time, ordered me to be clothed in the subterranean manner; that is, ornamented with
branches, as I had been at my first arrival below ground. My European clothes were taken from
me and hung up in the museum, with the following description attached:

DRESS OF THE CREATURES ABOVE GROUND.

After my fright from the monkey, I got no more sleep. In the morning I rose with the sun, and
went to receive my charge for the day. An innumerable number of errands were given me to perform,
together with letters and documents directed to all parts of the country.

This life I led four years; during my rambles I studied the character of the inhabitants, and
copied, as far as possible, their habits. The people generally are distinguished for the politeness
of their manners, and the sensibleness of their notions. The citizens of the town of Maholki,
only, are wanting in refinement and judgment; they are thorn trees; very obstinate and crabbed
in disposition, and great gossips, withal; let one take you by the button and you cannot get
away easily.

Each province is peopled by its own race of trees; in the country each village has one sect;
but the large cities contain a mixed population.

I had a good opportunity, as courier-general, to observe the peculiarities of these people,
and I shall now describe their polity and religion, their laws and sciences.

CHAPTER V.

THE KINGDOM OF POTU AND ITS INHABITANTS.

The kingdom of Potu is enclosed within very narrow boundaries, and occupies but a small space
of the inner globe.

The whole planet Nazar is scarcely six hundred miles in circumference, and may be travelled
over its whole extent without guide or interpreter, for there is but one language throughout.
As the Europeans on our globe take the first rank among the nations, so are the Potuans distinguished
among the nations of Nazar for their virtue and understanding.

The roads are dotted by stone pillars, which, covered with inscriptions, denote every mile;
affixed to them are hands pointing the road to every city and village;--splendid cities and
prosperous villages! The country is intersected by greater and lesser canals, on which boats
propelled by oars, skim with wonderful celerity. The oars are driven by self-moving machines,
so quietly that very little motion is given to the water. The planet Nazar has the same motion
with the earth, and all the peculiarities of the latter planet: night and day; spring, summer,
autumn, and winter. The inhabitants consist of oak, lime, poplar, thorn, and pine trees, from
which the months--there being six in each subterranean year--take their names.

The chronology is peculiar, being fixed by remarkable occurrences. Their oldest tradition is,
that three thousand years ago, a mighty comet appeared, immediately after which followed a
flood, which swept off all the races of trees, animals, &c., with the exception of one or two
of each race, who saved themselves upon a high mountain, and from whom descended the present
inhabitants. Corn and other grain with the fruits common to Europe, grow here in great profusion.
The waters are filled with fish, and upon the banks of the rivers are seated splendid country
houses. Their drink is prepared from certain herbs, which bloom at all times of the year.

In Potu is established a very useful law called the "generation law."

This law varies the liberties and advantages of the people according to the number of children
each one possesses. Thus, he who is the father of six children is exempted from all common
and extraordinary taxes. Therefore generation is quite as useful and desirable in this country
as on the earth it is burthensome and dangerous: below ground never was such a thing imagined
as a small-pox-tax.

No one can hold two offices at once. It is thought that each office, however small, requires
the sole attention of its occupant, and that none should be employed in that which they do
not understand.

I remember to have heard the philosopher Rakbasi speak thus: "Every one should know his own
talents, and should impartially judge of his own merits and faults; otherwise the actor must
be considered more sensible than natural men; for he chooses, not the best part, but that which
he can execute best. Shall we allow the actor to be wiser on the stage than we in life?"

The inhabitants of this kingdom are not divided into classes; those alone being regarded who
are noted for virtue and industry. The highest rank, if rank it may be called, is given to
those who possess the greatest number of branches, they being enabled to do the most work.

CHAPTER VI.

THE RELIGION OF THE POTUANS.

The system of religion in Potu is very simple.

It is forbidden, under pain of banishment to the firmament, to explain the holy books; whoever
dares to dispute the being and nature of the Deity, is sent to the mad-house and is bled. It
is foolish, they say, to attempt to describe that to which our senses are as blind as the eyes
of the owl in sunshine. All agree in worshiping a superior being, whose omnipotence has created
and whose providence maintains all things. Each one is permitted to think and worship as he
pleases; they only who publicly attack the prevailing religion, are punished as peace-disturbers.
The people pray seldom, but with so ardent a devotion, that a looker-on would think them enraptured
during the continuance of the prayer.

I told them that it was our custom to pray and sing psalms, while at our domestic duties. This
they blamed. "An earthly king," said they, "would be angry should one who came to petition
for something, brush his clothes and comb his hair in the presence of his sovereign."

They have many curious notions of religion, which they defend very artfully; for example, when
I remarked to some of them whose friendship I had gained, that they could not expect to be
blessed after death, since they walked in darkness here, they answered: "He, who with severity
condemned others, was himself in danger of being condemned."

I once advised them to pray every day. They did not deny the importance of prayer, but thought
true religion consisted in obeying the will of God. "Suppose," continued they, "that a king
has two kinds of subjects: some err every day, violating from ignorance or malice the ruler's
commands; they come each day with petitions and deprecations to the palace, beg pardon for
their faults, and depart only to recommit them.

"The others come seldom, and never voluntarily to court, but execute faithfully and diligently
every of the king's commands, and thereby evince the respect and loyalty due to him.

"Will not the king think these deserving of his love, as good subjects and faithful; but, on
the contrary, those as evil subjects, burthensome as well for their misdeeds as for their frequent
petitions?"

There are five festival days during the year. The first of these, which takes place at the
beginning of the oak month, is solemnized with great devotion, in dark places, where not a
ray of light is suffered to enter, signifying that the being they worship is inconceivable.
The festival is called the "inconceivable-God's-day." The whole day, from sunrise to sunset,
the people remain immovable, engaged in earnest and heart-felt prayer. In the four other festivals,
thanks to God for his blessings form the principal ceremonies.

CHAPTER VII.

THE POTUAN CONSTITUTION.

In the kingdom of Potu the crown is inherited, as with us, by the eldest son of the king, whose
power is absolute. The government, however, is rather fatherly than tyrannical. Justice is
not meted and bounded by law alone, but is the result of principle, a principle of the widest
philosophic comprehension. Thus, monarchy and liberty are closely united, which otherwise would
be inimical to each other. The ruler seeks to maintain, as far as possible, an equality among
his subjects. Honors are not limited to any class; but the poorer and more ignorant are called
upon to receive their opinions from and submit to the decisions of the richer and more intelligent:
the young are to respect the aged.

The annals of Potu show that some centuries ago, certain classes were highly favored by the
laws to the exclusion of the great body of the people; frequent disturbances had been the result
of this favoritism, till a citizen of the town Keba, proposed an alteration in the laws, by
which all distinctions of class were abolished, and while the office of king should still remain
hereditary, all the other officers of government should be subject to the will of the people,
all of whom should be allowed to vote, who could read and write, at least, their names.

According to the custom of the subterraneans in such affairs, this intelligent and patriotic
citizen was led to the market-place, with a rope about his neck: his proposition was considered,
and after grave deliberation was adopted, as conducive to the general interest.

The mover was then carried in triumph through the city, honored by the grateful shouts of the
people.

He, who has the most numerous offspring, is regarded as the most deserving citizen; he is honored
above all others, without exception.

Such men are looked upon as heroes, and their memory is sainted by posterity. They only receive
the name, which on the earth is awarded to the disturbers and enemies of the race--the name
of--great!

It is very easy to conceive of the degree in which Alexander and Julius Cæsar would be prized
by this people; both of whom not only had no children themselves, but murdered millions of
the offspring of others.

I remember to have read the following inscription on the tomb of a Keban peasant:

"Here lies Jorktan the great, the hero of his time, father of thirty children."

Among the court officers the Kadori, or grand-chamberlain, is the superior. Next after him
comes the Smizian, or treasurer. In my time, the seven-branched widow, Kahagna, filled the
latter place. She was a virtuous and industrious woman; although her duties were many and important,
she nursed her child herself. I remarked once, that I thought this to be troublesome and unfit
for so great a lady. I was replied to in this wise: "For what purpose has nature given breasts
to woman? for the ornament of the body alone,--or for the nourishment of their children?"

The crown prince was a child of six years; his governor was the wisest tree in the kingdom.
I have seen an abstract of moral philosophy and policy, written by him for the use of the prince,
the title of which is Mahalda Libal Helit, which in the subterranean language means, The Country's
Rudder. It contains many fundamental and useful precepts, of which I recollect the following:

"1st. Neither praise nor blame should be too hastily credited; judgment should be deferred
until accurate knowledge of the matter is obtained.

"2d. When a tree is accused of any crime, and the accusation is supported, then the life of
the culprit must be examined, his good and evil actions must be compared, and judgment be given
according to the preponderance of either.

"3d. The king must be accurately acquainted with the opinions of his subjects, and must strive
to keep union among them.

"4th. Punishment is not less necessary than reward. The former restrains evil; the latter promotes
good.

"5th. Sound reason teaches that especial regard should be had to the fitness of candidates
to public offices; but, though piety and honesty go to form the greatest merit, yet, as the
appearance of these virtues is often imposed on us for the reality, no tree should be severely
judged till he gets into office, when he will show himself what he is.

"6th. To make a treasurer of a poor man, or a bankrupt, is to make a hungry wolf purveyor of
the kitchen. The case of a rich miser is still stronger; the bankrupt or the penniless may
set bounds to their peculation; the miser never has enough.

"7th. When the prevalence of vice renders a reformation necessary, great care and deliberation
must be used; to banish at once, and in a mass, old and rooted faults, would be like prescribing
laxative and restringent medicines at the same time to an invalid.

"8th. They who boldly promise everything, and take upon themselves many duties, are either
fools who know not their own powers or the importance of affairs, or are mean and unjust citizens
who regard their own and not their country's welfare."

CHAPTER VIII.

THE ACADEMIES OF POTU.

In this kingdom are three academies; one in Potu, one in Keba, and one in Nahami.

The sciences taught in them are history, political economy, mathematics, and jurisprudence.
Their theological creed is so short that it can be written on two pages. It contains this doctrine
simply, that God, the creator of all things, shall be loved and honored; and that He will,
in an other life, reward us for our virtues and punish us for our vices. Theology forms no
part of an academical course, as it is forbidden by law to discuss these matters. Neither is
medicine numbered among the studies; for, as the trees live moderately, there is no such thing
as internal disease.

The students are employed in solving complicated and difficult questions, and he who most elegantly
and clearly explains his question, is entitled to a reward. No one studies more than one science,
and thus each gets a full knowledge of his peculiar subject.

The teachers themselves are obliged to give, each year, a proof of their learning. The teachers
of philosophy are required to solve some problem in morals; the historians, to elaborate some
passage in history; the jurists, to elucidate some intricate point of law; these last are the
only professors expected to be good orators. I told them that the study of rhetoric was common
to all students in our colleges, and that all studies were merged in it. They disapproved of
this, saying, that should all mechanics strive to make a masterly shoe, the work of most would
be bad, and the shoemakers alone would win the prize.

Besides these academies, there are preparatory gymnasiums, where great pains are taken to discover
the bent of the young, that they may be brought up in that science to which they are best fitted.
While I was at the seminary of Keba, the bishop had four sons there, preparing for a military
course; four others, whose father was a counsellor, were learning mechanical arts, and two
maidens were studying navigation. The rank and sex of the scholars are entirely overlooked,
in their regard to fitness and propriety.

He who challenges another to fight, loses forever his right to use weapons, and is condemned
to live under guardianship, as one who cannot curb his passions or temper his judgment. I observed
that the names of parties who go to law, are kept secret from the judge, he not being an inhabitant
of the place where the trial is carried on. The object of this singular law is to prevent all
partiality and bribery on the part of the judge, by withholding from him all knowledge of the
influence or property of the litigants.

Justice is executed without regard to persons. The king, indeed, is not required to appear
in court, but after death, his memory is put to the bar of public opinion, and his life is
vindicated or condemned through the peoples' advocates. This trial takes place before the Senate,
and judgment is freely pronounced according to the weight of the evidence. A herald proclaims
the decision, which is inscribed on the king's monument. The words used in these trials are:
Praiseworthy,--good,--not bad,--moderate,--tolerable. Sentence must be pronounced by one of
these words.

The Potuans give the following reason for this custom. The living king cannot be brought to
justice without causing rebellion. As long as he lives, the people owe to him blind obedience
and constant reverence. But when the king is dead, the bond between them is dissolved, and,
his memory belonging to them, they are bound to justify it as his virtues and vices principally
affected themselves.

The Potuanic annals show that for centuries only one king has received the last degree of judgment--tolerable--or,
in their tongue: Rip-fac-si. This was King Mikleta. Although the Potuans are well versed in
arms, and defend themselves bravely, when attacked, they never make war on others.

But this king excited by a miserable desire to extend the borders of his empire, entered into
an offensive war with his neighbors, and subdued many of them.

The Potuans gained, indeed, in power and wealth, but they suffered more from the loss of friendship
and the increase of fear and envy in the conquered. The honorable regard for justice and equity,
to which they had hitherto owed their prosperity and supremacy, began from that time to fade.
On the death of Mikleta, however, the people recovered from their folly, and showed their regret
for it, while at the same time they regained the good will of their neighbors, by putting a
blot upon the memory of their ruler.

But, to return to myself. I took but little pleasure in associating with my companions, a set
of absurd trees, who constantly ridiculed me for my quick perception.

This quality, I have already said, I was blamed for, very early in my career but by learned
trees, with grave and dignified complaisance. These saplings, on the contrary, pestered me
with silly nicknames. For example, they took a malicious delight in calling me Skabba, which
means an untimely or unripe thing.

CHAPTER IX.

THE JOURNEY AROUND THE PLANET NAZAR.

I had now performed the toilsome duties of a courier for two years, having been every where
with orders and letters. I was tired of this troublesome and unbecoming business. I sent to
the king petition after petition, asking for my discharge, and soliciting for a more honorable
appointment. But I was repeatedly refused, for his majesty did not think my abilities would
warrant promotion. He condescended to refer me to the laws and customs, which allowed those
only to be placed in respectable and important offices, who were fitted for them by talent
and virtue. It was necessary, he continued, that I should remain where I was, till I could,
by my merits, pave my way to distinction. He concluded thus:

    Study to know yourself, is wisdom's rule;
    The wise man reasons,--blunders, still, the fool.
    Strive not with feeble powers great weights to move,
    Before your shoulders long experience prove.

I was thus obliged to remain, as patiently as I could, in my old service, amusing myself in
thinking how to bring my talents to the light. In my continual journeys about the country,
I studied the nature of the people, the quality of the soil; and, in short, became accurately
acquainted with every thing worthy of observation. That I might not forget any thing, I used
myself to write notes of each journey. These notes I enlarged afterwards, as well as I could,
and was thus enabled to deliver to the king a volume of considerable size.

I soon observed that this work was far from being displeasing to his majesty. He read it through
with attention, and then recommended it to the senate with much ceremony. It was soon determined
that I should be made use of to discover and make known whatever there was of interest throughout
the planet. Truly! I expected some other reward for my sleepless nights and laborious days,
than still greater burthens, still heavier travail. But I could only in silence sigh with the poet:

    "Alas! that Virtue should be praised by all,--
    Should warm, with its mild beams, all hearts:
    Yet mock and freeze its owner."

However, as I have always had a great desire to see and hear every thing new, and expected,
withal, a magnificent reward from the really kind-hearted king on my return, I set about this
work with a kind of pleasure.

Although the planet Nazar is but about six hundred miles in circumference, it seems, to the
trees, of vast extent, principally on account of their slow movement. No Potuan could go round
it in less time than two years, whereas, I, with my long legs, could traverse it easily in
two months.

I set out on this journey in the Poplar month.

Most of the things which I shall now relate, are so curious, that the reader may be easily
brought to believe them to be written from mere whim, or at least to be poetical contrivance.
The physical and moral diversities are so many and so great, on this planet, that a man who
has only considered the difference between the antipodal nations of the earth, can form but
a faint idea of the same. It must be observed that the nations of Nazar are divided by sounds
and seas, and that this globe is a kind of Archipelago.

It would be wearisome to relate all my adventures, and I shall limit my remarks to those people
who seemed to me the most remarkable.

The only things which I found in common with all, were figure and language. All were trees.
But in customs, gestures, and sense, so great was the diversity, that each province appeared
like a new world.

In Quamso, the province next to Potu, the inhabitants are entirely oak trees. They know not
of bodily weakness or disease, but arrive in perfect and continued health to a very great age.
They seem to be the most fortunate of all creatures; but I found, after some intercourse with
them, that this assumption was a great mistake. Although I never saw any of them sad, yet none
appeared to be happy. The purest heaven is never impressive, but after a storm; so happiness
is not appreciated by these oaks, because it is never interrupted; they bless not health, because
they are never sick. They spend their lives in tame and uninterrupted indifference. Possessed
of little politeness and goodness of heart, their conversation is cold and cheerless; their
manners stiff and haughty. Without passions, they are crimeless; without weakness, they are
pitiless.

Those alone to whom pain and sickness bring the remembrance of their mortality, learn in their
own sufferings, to sympathise with and compassionate the woes of others.

I was now in a land, where I had a living proof of how much the occurrence of pain and the
fear of death tend to produce mutual love and cheerful converse among fellow beings. Here,
for the first time, I came to know the folly and sin of grumbling at the Creator, for bringing
upon us trouble and suffering, which are really good for us, and which produce the happiest
consequences.

The province Lalak, which is sometimes called Maskatta, or the Blessed Land, was the next in
the order of my journey. This land is very appropriately named. All things spring forth spontaneously:

    Here, between melon vines and moist strawberry,
      Flow milky brooks and amber streams of mead;
    There, luscious wine, from crystal, spouts more merry,
      As Bacchus from his slumber had been freed.
    Far down along the mountain's verdant side,
      The limpid juice, with golden lustre, ripples.
    In dales, soft undulating, oozing glide
      Sweet waters, out of teeming nature's nipples;
    And trees of Paradise their branches reach,
      Bending with purple plum and mellow peach.
    From all the land nutritious savors rise,
      To bless its sons, then mount to scent the skies.

These advantages do not, by any means, make the inhabitants happy. It occurred to me, that
laborers in harsher climates are much better off than these people, who necessarily languish
in idleness and luxury.

Next to Lalak is Mardak, inhabited by cypresses. Of these are different descents or races,
determined by the number or shape of their eyes. Here is a list of the varieties:

Nagiri, who have oblong eyes; to whom all objects appear oblong.

Naquire, whose eyes are square.

Palampi, who have very small eyes.

Jaraku, with two eyes, which are turned in opposite directions.

Mehanki, with three eyes.

Panasuki, with four eyes.

Harramba, whose eyes occupy the whole forehead; and finally,

Skodolki, who have a single eye in the neck.

The most numerous and powerful of these races, are the Nagirians. Kings, senators and priests
are always chosen from this class. None are admitted to any office, but those who acknowledge
and testify by oath, that a certain table, dedicated to the sun and placed in the temple, is
oblong. This table is the holiest object of mardakanic worship. The oath, to be taken by aspirants
to honors, is as follows:

"Kaki manaska quihampu miriac jakku, mesimbrii caphani crukkia, manaskar quebriac krusondora."

In English:

"I swear, that the holy table of the sun seems oblong to me, and I promise to remain in this
opinion until my last breath."

When the neophyte, of either class, has sworn this oath, he is taken up among the Nagirians,
and is qualified for any office. On the day after my arrival, as I walked in the market-place,
I met a party bearing an old man to the whipping post. I asked them the nature of his offence,
and was told that he was a heretic, who had publicly declared that the holy table of the sun
appeared square to him.

I immediately entered the temple, being curious to know whether or not my eyes were orthodox.
The table was certainly square to my view, and I said so to my landlord, on my return. This
tree, who had been recently appointed a church-warden, drew a deep sigh on this occasion, and
confessed that it also seemed square to him, but that he dared not express such an opinion,
openly, from fear of being ejected from office, if not worse.

Trembling in every joint, I quietly left this region, fearful that my back might suffer on
account of my heterodox vision.

The duchy of Kimal is considered the mightiest and richest of the states on this planet. There
are numberless silver mines within its borders: the sand of its rivers is colored by gold,
and its coasts are paved with pearl oysters of the finest water.

The people of this province, nevertheless, are more miserable than those of any other I visited.
They are miners, gold-strainers and pearl-divers, condemned to the most infamous slavery, drenched
in water, or secluded from air and light, and all for the sake of dear gain. How strange and
senseless is the lust for brilliant baubles!

The possessors of wealth are obliged to keep a continual watch over their property, for the
land is full of robbers. None can travel without an armed retinue. Thus, this people, on which
their neighbors look with longing eyes, should deserve pity rather than excite envy. Fear,
mistrust and jealousy rage in all hearts: each regards his neighbor as an enemy. Sorrows and
terrors, sleepless nights, pale faces and trembling hands are the fruits of that very wealth,
which their neighbors look upon as the greatest good.

My wanderings through Kimal were the most unpleasant and dangerous in all my experience. My
course was towards the east. I journeyed among many people, who were generally polite and social,
but whose customs were not singular enough to merit particular attention. I had much cause
to wonder, when I came among the Quambojas, in whom nature was entirely perverted. The older
these people grow, the more lustful they become. Rashness, lasciviousness and roguery increase
with years. None are suffered to hold offices after the fortieth year. At this age, the wildness
and moral insensibility of boyhood begins; the sports of childhood, only, are tolerated. The
tree becomes a minor, and is placed under the guardianship of his younger relations.

I did not think it advisable to remain long in Quamboja, where in a few years, I should be
sentenced to become a child again.

I witnessed a perversion of a different kind in Kokleku. In the former province, nature is
the agent of this perversion; here the law is the agent. The Koklekuans are juniper trees.

The males alone cook and perform all domestic duties. In time of war, they serve in the army,
but always in the ranks. To the females, are entrusted all civil, divine and military offices.
The females reason thus: The males are endowed with greater bodily strength, and greater powers
of endurance; therefore, it is clear that nature intended them to do all the work. But this
will keep them so busy, that they will not have time to think. Moreover, as continual physical
labor degrades the mind, if they should presume to think, their thoughts would be puerile,
and practically useless. Therefore, it is plain, that to the females belongs the direction
of affairs. The lady of the house may be found in the study with books and papers about her,
while the master is in the kitchen cooking and washing.

I saw many mournful effects of this inconsistent custom.

In other places, females are to be found, who bring their chastity to market and trade with
their charms. Here the young males sell their nights, and for this end congregate in certain
dwellings, before which signs are hung out. When these males get to be too troublesome, they
are punished as prostitutes are, elsewhere. Females stroll about the streets, beckon to the
men, stare at them, whistle and cry psh! to them; chuckle them under the chin and do all manner
of tricks, without the least sense of shame. These females boast of their victories, as dandies,
with us, plume themselves on their intimacy with ladies, whose only favor may have been a sharp
box on the ear. None are here blamed for besieging a young male with love letters and presents.
But a young fellow would be looked upon as having outraged all decency, should he stammer out
a faint yes, to the first entreaty of a young female.

At the time I was in the country a terrible commotion arose on account of the violation of
a senator's son by a young virgin. She was generally condemned for this high-handed and abominable
action. The friends of the youth insisted that she should be prosecuted, and if the crime were
proved, sentenced to mend the young fellow's honor by marrying him, especially as it could
be sworn to that he had lived a pure and virtuous life till this libertiness had seduced him.

Blessed Europe! I exclaimed on this occasion; thrice blessed France and England! where the
names--weaker sex--frail vessels--are no idle names:--where the wives are so entirely subjected
to their husbands that they seem to be rather machines or automatons than creatures endowed
with free will and noble aspirations!

The most splendid building in Kokleku is the Queen's harem, in which three hundred beautiful
young fellows are shut up for life. So jealous is the queen, that no female is allowed to approach
the walls within one hundred yards. Never beholding any of their race but the queen and a few
dried-up and ugly spinsters, the poor creatures vegetate, mindless and joyless.

Having heard, accidentally, that my form had been praised in the presence of the queen, I hastily
escaped from this unnatural and execrable land:

    --Fear to my feet gave wings.

Continuing my course still to the east, I came to the philosophical-land, as its inhabitants,
who are principally engaged in the study of philosophy and the sciences, vain-gloriously call
it. I had long and earnestly wished to see this land, which I enthusiastically ascribed to
be the seat of the muses.

I hurried on with all possible celerity. But the roads were so full of stones, holes and bogs,
that I was delayed, besmirched, and bruised. However, I endured these troubles patiently, anticipating
the delights that awaited me, and well knowing that the path to paradise is not over roses.
When I had struggled onward for an hour I met a peasant, of whom, after saluting him, I demanded
how far distant the borders of Maskattia were? "You should rather ask," he replied, "how far
you must go back;--for you are now in the very middle of it!"

In great astonishment I asked, "How is it, that a land inhabited by pure philosophers, should
appear like the abode of wild animals and ignorant barbarians?" "Indeed," said the peasant,
"It would look better if the people could find time to attend to such trifles. At present they
must be excused, for they have higher and nobler things in their heads: they are now speculating
about the shortest road to the sun. Nobody can blow and swallow at the same time."

I understood the meaning of the cunning peasant, and left him, after getting the direction
to the capital city, Casea. Instead of guards and the usual collection about the gates of a
large town, hens and geese strutted about at their ease: in the crevices of the gate hung birds-nests
and cobwebs.

In the streets philosophers and swine were mingled together, and both classes being alike filthy,
they were only to be distinguished from each other by form.

The philosophers wore a kind of cloak, of the color of which I should not dare to give an opinion,
so thick was the dirt upon them. I was run into by one of these wise men, who seemed to be
enraptured by some speculation.

"I beg pardon, master of arts!" I exclaimed, "may I ask of you the name of this town?" He stood
for some time immovable, with closed eyes; then recovering somewhat from his trance, and rolling
his eyes upwards, he muttered: "We are not far from noon!"

This untimely answer, which betrayed a perfect insensibility, convinced me that intelligence
resulting from methodical and practical study is preferable to the torpid insanity incident
to much learning.

I went on, hoping to meet with some sensible animal, or any body rather than a philosopher.
In the market-place,--a very extensive square,--were a great many statues and pillars, covered
with inscriptions.

I approached one of them to get, if possible, the meaning of the characters. While engaged
in spelling the words, my back suddenly became warm, and immediately after I felt warm water
trickling down my legs. I turned round to discover the fountain of the stream, and, lo! an
abstracted philosopher was performing, at ease on my back, the same operation that the dogs
do against the study.

This infamous trick excited my wrath, and I gave him a severe blow.

The philosopher regained his wits at this, and seizing me by the hair, dragged me around the
market-place. Our struggles soon brought us both to the ground. Then a multitude of philosophers
came running towards us, and having dragged me from under my opponent, beat me with their sticks
till I became senseless. I was then carried to a large house and thrown into the middle of
the hall. I now recovered in a measure from my ill treatment.

On seeing this, the wise man who first insulted me, recommenced to beat me, notwithstanding
my prayers for mercy. I now learned that the intensity of no anger can be compared to the philosophical;
and that the teachers of virtue and moderation are not called upon to practise the same. The
longer my oppressor beat me, the more did his blood boil. At last there came into the hall
four sophists, whose cloaks proclaimed them to be of a different class from my late tyrants.
They had some compassion for me, and soothed the rage of the others. I was taken to another
house, and right glad was I to escape the hands of the bandits, and get among honest people.

I related to my protectors the cause of the calamity. They laughed heartily at the whole matter,
and then explained to me that the philosopher, absorbed in deep thought, had mistaken me for
a pillar before which it is customary, on certain natural occasions, to stop.

Just when I supposed myself in safety. I nearly gave up the ghost from fear. I was led into
a dissecting room, filled with bones and dead bodies, the stench from which was intolerable.

After languishing in this disgusting den for half an hour, the lady of the house brought in
my dinner, which she had prepared herself. She was very polite and amiable; but looked at me
closely, and sighed continually. I asked the reason of her sorrow. She answered, "that she
became sick when she thought of what I was to suffer."

"You have, indeed," she said, "come among honest people, for my husband, who lives in this
house, is a doctor of medicine, and the others are his colleagues: but your uncommon figure
has awakened their curiosity, and they have determined to take your internal structure into
close consideration. In fine, they intend to cut you up, in the hope of finding some new phenomena
in anatomy." I was thunder-struck at hearing these tidings. I cried out indignantly:

"How can people be called honest, madam! who entertain strangers only to cut them up?"

"You should stick your fingers in the ground," she replied, "and smell the land you have got
into!" I begged her with tears in my eyes to intercede for me. She answered, "My intercession
would be of no service to you: but I will endeavor to save you by other means." She then took
my hand, carefully led me out by a back door, and guided me to the city gate.

Here I would have taken leave of my kind and gentle guide; but while manifesting my gratitude
in the most lively expressions, she suddenly interrupted my speech and signified her intention
not to leave me till I should be in perfect safety. She would not be persuaded to return. We
walked on together. Meanwhile she entertained me with just and sensible remarks on the customs
and follies of the people. Afterwards she turned the discourse to more delicate matters. We
were at some distance from the city. My soft companion adverted to the danger from which she
had saved me, and suddenly demanded of me, in return, a politeness which was morally impossible.

She told me with much feeling and warmth of the unfortunate fate of females in this land:--that
the philosophers, entirely absorbed by their speculations, and buried among their books, neglect
to an alarming extent, the duties of marriage. "Yes," she continued, "I can swear to you, that
we should be wholly undone if some polite traveller did not occasionally take pity on our miserable
condition, and mitigate our torments."

I pretended not to understand her meaning, and showed the usual common-place and complacent
sympathy.

But my coolness was as oil to the flame. I increased my pace. The poor lady, whose heart had
hitherto been subjected to the sweet-smiling goddess, now changed to a fury.

I fled from my new danger. Fear and length of legs enabled me to outstrip her. Mingled with
her shrieks, opprobrious epithets fell fast; the last I could distinguish were: Kaki Spalaki:--ungrateful
hound!

I passed on to other provinces, in which I found but little uncommon and peculiar.

I now thought that I had seen all the wonders of Nazar. But when I came to the land of Cabac,
more curious and more incredible things were disclosed to my gaze. Among the Cabacans there
is a certain class without heads. These are born without that appendage. They speak through
a hole in the middle of the breast. On account of this natural defect, they are generally excluded
from offices where brains are thought to be useful. They are notwithstanding a serviceable
class: the most of them are to be seen at court; being gentlemen of the bed-chamber, stewards
of the household, keepers of the harem, &c.

Beadles, vestry-clerks and such brainless officers are chosen from this class.

Occasionally one of them is taken up into the senate, either by the particular favor of government,
or through the influence of friends. This is done, generally, without injury to the country;
for it is well known that the business of the country is carried on by a few senators, and
that the rest are only useful to fill the seats, and agree and subscribe to the determinations
of the leaders.

The inhabitants of the two provinces, Cambara and Spelek, are all lime trees. But their resemblance
ends in form. The Cambarans live only about four years. The Spelekians, on the other hand,
attain to the wonderful age of four hundred years.

In the former place, the people have their full growth a few weeks after birth, and finish
their education before the first year. During the three remaining years they prepare for death.
The province appeared to be a true Platonic republic, in which all the virtues reached to their
perfection. The inhabitants, on account of their short lives, are, as it were, continually
on the wing. They regard this life as a gate through which they hastily pass. Their hearts
are fixed on the future rather than on the present. They may be called true philosophers, for
they care not for luxury and pleasure, but strive through fear of God, virtuous actions, and
clear consciences, to make themselves worthy of eternal happiness. In a word, this land seemed
to be the habitation of saints and angels;--the only school of virtue.

I was here brought to think of the unreasonableness of those who grumble at the shortness of
life,--those quarrellers with providence! Life can be called short when passed in luxury and
idleness. The shortest life is long when it is well employed.

In Spelek, on the contrary, all the vices common to erring creatures seem to be congregated.
The people have only the present in their minds, for the future has no sensible vanishing point.
Sincerity, honesty, chastity and decency have taken flight to give place to falsehood, lasciviousness,
and bad manners.

I was happy to get away from this province, although I was obliged to traverse desolate and
rocky regions which lay beyond it. These deserts separate Spelek from Spalank, or the "Innocent
Land."

This name is obtained from the meekness and innocence of the inhabitants. These are all stone
oaks, and are thought to be the happiest of all sensible beings. They are not subject to any
agitation of mind, and are free from all vices.

    Free, of compulsion ignorant, did all obey
    The simple rules of nature. Justice easy
    And virtue unadorned they practised; for unknown
    Were punishment and fear. On no holy stone
    Were menaces engraved: no holy table
    Declared the thunders of the law. None trembled
    At the ruler's frown or nod: but, without guard,--
    With sharpened steel on shoulder ready poised,--
    Or castled wall bristling with murder's tools,
    Were all ranks safe. On no battle-field
    Was victor crowned or bloody altar
    Heaped with his kinsmen's corpses.
                              With sports
    And pleasant tales, in infant innocence they lived
    (The innocence that lies in mother's lap unstained.)
    Thus passed they from the fond embrace of peace,
    With easy change to Death's determined grasp.

When I came to this province, I found that the reputation which these people had gained, namely:
that they practised virtue from inclination rather than from the authority of law--was well
founded.

But as envy and ambition were entirely unknown to them,--the inducements to excel, and the
will for great things were wanting.

They had no palaces, no courts, no fine buildings. They had no magistrates to administer law;
no avarice to carry them to court. In fine, although without vices, they knew nothing of the
arts,--of splendid virtues,--nor of any of the things which refine a people. They appeared
to be rather an oak forest than a sensible and thoughtful nation.

I travelled next through the province Kiliak. The natives of this province are born with certain
marks on their foreheads, which point out how long they will live. At first I imagined these
people to be happy, as death could never overtake them unexpectedly, nor tear them away in
the midst of their sins. But as each one knows on what day he shall die, it is usual to postpone
repentance till the last hour. They only are really pious who begin to sing their death song.

I saw several move about the streets with drooping heads and miserable looks--the signs upon
their foreheads proclaimed their speedy dissolution.

They counted their remaining hours and minutes upon their fingers, and regarded with horror
the rapidity of time.

The Creator's wisdom and goodness to us in this respect became obvious to me in this land.
I could no longer doubt that it is better for us to be ignorant of the future.

From Kiliak I sailed over a black sound to the kingdom of Askarak; there new wonders greeted
me. While in Cabac, people are to be seen without heads, here, on the contrary, individuals
come into the world with seven heads. These are great universal geniuses. In former times,
they were worshiped with almost divine veneration, and were made senators, chief magistrates,
&c. As they had as many plans and expedients as heads, they executed with zeal and rapidity
many different things, and while the government was in their hands, there was nothing left
unchanged.

But as they made several sets of ideas effective at once, it happened, very naturally, that
these ideas came in contact with each other. At last, they mingled together so intricately,
that the seven-headed geniuses could not discriminate in from out. The affairs of government
became so disordered that centuries were required to restore them to the simplicity from which
these all-knowing magistrates had brought them.

A law had been established, before I went there, by which all seven-headed people were excluded
from important offices, and the administration of government was given to simple and ordinary
persons, that is, persons with but one head.

The many-headed now occupy the same places as the headless of Cabac.

Beyond Askarak, and separated from it by extensive deserts, lays the Duchy of Bostanki. The
Bostankins resemble the Potuans in their external form. Their internal construction is very
singular. The heart is placed in the right leg; so that it may be literally said of them, that
their hearts are in their breeches.

They are notorious for being the greatest cowards among all the inhabitants of Nazar.

Angry, from faintness and fatigue, I came to a tavern near the city gates. I could not abstain
from growling at the landlord because he could not provide what I called for. The poor fellow
fell on his knees before me, begged my pardon amid tears and groans, and held his right leg
towards me that I might feel how his heart beat.

At this I laughed, and almost forgot to be angry. I wiped the tears from the poor sinner's
eyes, and told him not to be afraid. He rose up, kissed my hand, and went out to prepare my
food. Not long after, I heard lamentable cries and howls in the kitchen. I hastened thither,
and to my great astonishment, saw the humble and trembling Monsieur poltroon engaged, very
valiantly, in beating his wife and servant girls. When he perceived me he took to flight. I
turned to the weeping wife and girls and demanded what could have excited such terrible anger
in my lamb-like host. They stood for some time, silently, with their eyes fixed on the ground.
At length, the wife replied in the following words: "You do not seem, dear stranger! to have
much knowledge of human nature. The citizens of this place, who dare not look at an armed enemy,
and, at the least noise, creep like mice into holes, hector in the kitchens, and tyrannize
over us feeble women."

Thoroughly disgusted by the mean and cowardly spirit of this people, I hired a boat to go to
Mikolak. On landing I missed my outer coat, which I recollected to have put in the boat at
starting. After quarrelling a long time with the boatman, who denied all knowledge of it, I
went to a magistrate, and related the whole matter to him. I asserted that I had at least a
right to demand my own property, if I could not sue at law one with whom I had entrusted my goods.

The boatman still denied the theft, and required that I should be punished for wrongly accusing
him. In this doubtful case, the court demanded witnesses. This demand I could not answer, but
proposed that my opponent should take oath on his innocence.

At this proposal the judge smiled and said: "In this land, my friend, there is no weight in
religious confirmation. The laws are our gods. Proof must, therefore, be given in a formal
manner, by witnesses or written documents. Whoever cannot do this not only lose their case,
but are subject to punishment for malicious accusation. Prove your case by witnesses, and you
will get your own again." I lost my case, but from regard to the hospitality due to strangers,
was not punished.

I had far more reason to pity this people than to regret my own loss. How weak is that society
which relies for its safety on bare human laws. It is like a city built on a volcanic mountain!
Little firmness has that political structure which rests not on the foundation of religion.

Leaving this atheistic land, I crossed a very high mountain to Bragmat, which lays in a dale
at the foot of the mountain. The people of this city are juniper trees. The first that I met
rushed towards me, and pressing with the weight of his body, felled me to the ground. When
I demanded the reason of this rough salutation, he begged my pardon in the most polite and
elegant expressions. A few minutes after, another struck me in the side with a hedge-pole,
and likewise excused his carelessness in a pretty speech. I thought they must be blind, and
gave to all I passed a very wide berth.

I was afterwards informed that some among them were possessed of a very sharp sight, so that
they can behold objects far beyond the view of others, but they could not see what was directly
before them. These sharp-sighted people are called Makkati, and are, most of them, adepts in
astronomy and transcendental philosophy.

I passed through several other provinces, in which I found nothing worthy to be recorded in
this history; and returned to Potu after an absence of two months.

I entered the city of Potu on the tenth day of the Ash month. The first thing I did was to
deliver my journal to the king, who ordered it to be printed.

It must be observed that the art of printing, which both the Europeans and Chinese claim to
have invented, has been well known in Nazar for ages. The Potuans were so much pleased with
my book that they were never tired of reading it. Little trees carried it about the streets
and cried: "Court-footman Skabba's Travels around the Globe."

Puffed up by my success, I now strove for higher things, and awaited, somewhat impatiently,
an appointment to a great and respectable office. My expectations not being answered, I gave
in a new petition, in which I eulogized my work and claimed a suitable reward for my uncommon
merit.

The mild and beneficent king was moved by my prayers, and promised to keep me in gracious remembrance.

He kept his promise, but not to my liking, for his grace consisted only in making an addition
to my stipend.

I had pointed my nose another way, but not daring to press the king with more petitions, I
made my complaint to the great chancellor. This very sensible personage listened to me with
his usual urbanity, and promised to serve me. At the same time he advised me to abandon my
unreasonable desires, and take a more exact view of my weak judgment and general insignificance.
"Nature," he said, "has been a step-mother to you; you want, altogether, the talents which
clear the road to important offices. You must creep before you walk; and it is foolish to think
of flying without wings." He acknowledged my merits: "But," he continued, "it is not such merits
as yours that will give you admittance to State affairs. If all merit should give this right,
then every painter and sculptor, this for his skill in carving, that for his knowledge of colors,
might demand a seat at the council board. Merit ought to be rewarded, but the reward should
be adapted to the object, that the State may not suffer."

This speech struck me, and had the effect to keep me very quiet for some time. But I could
not endure the thought of growing grey in my base employment. I determined on the desperate
attempt, which I had formerly considered, to improve the constitution, and thus, by a bold
stroke, to advance my own and the country's welfare.

Shortly before my journey I had strictly examined the internal condition of the kingdom, to
discover the least failing in its machinery, and the best means to remedy it.

In the province Kokleku I had learnt that the government waggles in which women have a part.
For being by nature vain, they strive to extend their power in every conceivable direction,
and stop not till they have procured for themselves perfect and unlimited dominion.

I concluded, therefore, to propose the exclusion of the fair sex from all public offices, and
trusted to get a sufficiency of voices on my side by placing the case in its best light. It
seemed an easy matter, to me, to convince the male sex of the dangers to which they were exposed,
if they did not, in time, weaken this female power.

I executed this plan with all the art I was possessed of, supporting it with the most cogent
reasons, and sent it to the king.

He, who had given me many proofs of his favor, was astonished at this miserable and impertinent
project, as he graciously called it, and said, that it would fall out to my destruction.

But relying partly on my reasonings and partly on the support of the whole male population,
I held obstinately to my plan. According to law, I was led to the market-place with a rope
about my neck, to await the decision of the Council. When the counsellors had given their votes,
the sentence was sent to be subscribed by the king, which being done, it was publicly read
by a herald, as follows:

"On mature consideration we adjudge, that the proposal made by Sr: Skabba, first court-footman
to his majesty, to exclude the second sex from public offices, cannot be accepted, without
affecting the peace and order of the kingdom: since the women, who form the half of our population,
would naturally be excited by this innovation, and thereby become hostile and troublesome to
the government. Furthermore, we hold it to be unjust to deny, to trees of excellent qualities,
admission to offices of which they have hitherto shown themselves to be worthy and especially
it is incredible, that nature, which does nothing inconsiderately, should have idly endued
them with superior and varied gifts. We believe the welfare of the kingdom requires that a
regard should be had to fitness rather than to names, in the disposal of offices. As the land
is not seldom in need of capable subjects, we pronounce a statute which should declare an entire
half of the inhabitants, merely from birth, unworthy of and useless in affairs, to be deplorable.

"After grave deliberation we declare this to be justice: let the aforesaid Skabba, for his
no less despicable than bold proposal, suffer the usual punishment in such cases."

The good king took my misfortune to heart, but did not seek to change the resolution of the
Council. As a matter of form he signed the warrant for my execution. Yet with his characteristic
mildness, and in consideration of my having been born and educated in a strange world, where
a quick and reckless head is thought to be a blessing, he commuted my punishment to imprisonment
till the beginning of the Birch month, when, with other animals, I should be banished to the
firmament. When this sentence was published, I was sent to prison.

CHAPTER X.

THE VOYAGE TO THE FIRMAMENT.

Twice a year, some very large birds, called Kupakki or post birds, are wont to show themselves
on the planet Nazar.

They come and go at certain regular periods, which has given rise to various opinions. Some
think, that insects, of which great multitudes appear at the same periods, and which the birds
are very fond of eating, entice them down to the planet. This is my own notion. The circumstance,
that when these insects disappear, the birds return to the firmament, places the opinion almost
beyond all doubt. It is the same instinct, which leads certain species of birds on our earth
to migrate at regular periods.

Others believe, that these birds are trained like hawks and other birds of prey, to fetch booty
from other lands. This conjecture is grounded upon the great care with which they lay down
their burdens, when their flight is finished. This supposition is somewhat strengthened by
the fact, that they become tame and gentle just before they begin their flight, suffering themselves
to be thrown into nets, under which they lie immovable. Meanwhile they are fed with insects
till the regular period arrives. Then a long box, just large enough to hold a tree or man,
is fastened to a rope, which is again tied to the legs of the bird. On the banishment day,
food is withheld from them, the nets are raised, and the kupakkis wing their way to the firmament.

Two citizens of Potu had been doomed to banishment with myself. One was a metaphysician, who
had offended the law by making some sage remarks upon the nature of spirits; the other was
a fanatic, who, by starting doubts concerning the holiness of religion and the uniting force
of the civil law, was suspected to have designed the overthrow of both. This latter would not
regulate himself by the public ordinances, because, he said, all civil obedience was inconsistent
with his conscience. Thus three of us, namely, a project-maker, a metaphysician, and a fanatic,
were, on the first day of the Birch month, shut up in boxes.

I never knew what became of my fellow-sufferers. As for myself, I was enclosed, with food sufficient
for a few days. Shortly after, my kupakki, finding nothing to eat, started off with amazing speed.

It is generally believed, under ground, that the distance between the planet Nazar and the
firmament is about four hundred miles. I had no means of determining how long my passage was,
but conjectured it to be about twenty-four hours.

I heard nothing, during this time, but the heavy and monotonous flapping of the kupakki's wings.
At last, there sounded in my ears a confounding noise, which announced that we could not be
far from land.

I now observed that the bird had really been trained, for he set the box, with so much care
on the ground, that I did not feel the slightest jar. The box was immediately opened, and I
rose up in the midst of a great multitude of monkeys, who, to my astonishment, conversed together
in an intelligent language rather than chattered, and walked to and fro, in measured and dignified
paces. They were dressed in cloths of varied colors. A number of them advanced towards me with
much politeness, and handed me from the box.

They seemed to be surprised at my figure, particularly when they discovered I had no tail.
Their amazement was not at all lessened by the fact, that I resembled them (laying aside the
tail) more nearly than did any stranger they had hitherto seen.

At the time of my arrival the water was very high, owing to the nearness of Nazar. This planet
has the same effect upon the tides of the firmament, as our moon has upon those of the earth.

I was led to a very large building, ornamented in the richest style. The presence of a guard
at the door convinced me that it was the residence of no common monkey. It was, as I afterwards
learnt, the residence of the mayor of the monkeys.

A number of teachers were selected to instruct me in their language.

In three months I was enabled to speak with considerable readiness. Then I expected to procure
for myself the admiration of all, for my prompt ingenuity and superior memory. But my teachers
declared me to be sluggish and dull of apprehension, and in their impatience often threatened
to abandon their charge. As, on the planet Nazar, I had been ironically named Skabba, or the
untimely, for my quick perceptions, so here I was called Kakidoran, which signifies, idle and
stupid. Those only are respected here, who can comprehend and express any thing instantaneously.
I amused myself during the course of my studies by walking about the city, in which I met on
all sides notable signs of splendor and luxury.

When I had finished my education, that is, when I could speak fluently, I was carried to the
capital city Martinia, from which the whole country takes its name. The object of the mayor
evidently was, to insinuate himself into the favor of a certain counsellor, by presenting to
him a strange and unprecedented animal.

The government of Martinia is aristocratical. The state is administered by a great council,
selected from the body of the old nobility.

Before proceeding to the house of the lord, to whom I was to be offered, the mayor led me to
a hotel, where we could make ourselves presentable to his excellency. Several servants, called
maskatti, or dressers, joined us for this purpose. One took the mayor's sword to burnish it;
another tied different colored bands to his tail. I will here remark, that nothing lays nearer
to a monkey's heart than the adornment of his tail.

When my conductor was polished, dressed and adorned, we departed for the president's palace,
followed by three servants.

On coming to the entrance, the mayor loosed his shoes, that he might not soil the marble floor.
After waiting for a long time, with not a little impatience, we were suffered to enter the
reception hall. Here the president sat in a golden chair.

As soon as he saw us, the president burst out in a terrific laugh. I concluded either that
he was seized by delirium, or that silly and insane laughter was a peculiarity of great people
in Martinia. In short, I took his lordship to be a fool.

I afterwards expressed this opinion to the mayor; but he assured me that the president was
a monkey of remarkable natural powers; that his mind was so comprehensive, that he not only
determined matters of the highest importance at table, with his glass in hand, but even wrote
or dictated a new statute between the courses.

His excellency tattled to me half an hour, his tongue wagging, the while, with an agility immeasurably
superior to that of our European barbers.

Then turning to my companion, he said, he would take me among his subordinate attendants, since
he perceived, from my sluggish disposition, that I must have been born in the land of stupidity,
where

    Long-eared mortals, in perpetual fogs,
    Oft lose their way to mire in horrid bogs:--

and consequently that I was unfit for any office of trust and respectability. "I have, indeed,"
urged the mayor, "observed a natural obtuseness in this man; nevertheless, when he is allowed
time to think, he judges by no means badly."

"Of what use is that," replied the president; "here we need nimble officers, for the immense
diversity of our affairs does not give us time to think."

The president, having spoken thus, very gravely, and carefully examined my body, and directed
me to lift a heavy weight from the floor. Seeing that I did this with ease, he remarked: "Nature,
although she has stinted you in the faculties of the soul, has compensated, in some measure,
by granting to you a degree of bodily strength."

I now received orders to go out and wait in the court. Soon after the mayor followed, and as
he passed, told me that his excellency had determined to include me in his train.

I concluded from his lordship's undervaluing opinion of me, that my situation could not be
very elevated; still, I was curious to know my fate, and therefore asked the mayor if he knew
what I was to be entrusted with. The mayor answered: "His excellency, with special grace, has
appointed you for his chief porteur,[1] with a yearly pay of twenty-five stercolatus." (A stercolatu
is about one dollar of our money.) "Furthermore, he will not require your services for any
but himself and her grace, his lady." This answer was like a thunder-stroke to me; but I was
sensible that it was useless to object.

I was carried to a chamber, where a supper of dried fruits was laid; after eating a little,
my bed was pointed out to me.

I threw myself upon the bed, but my mind was so agitated, that I could not for a time close
my eyes in sleep. The pride and contempt with which the monkeys regarded me, provoked me almost
to rage. A more than Spartan patience was needed to listen with indifference to their sneers.
At last I slumbered. How long I know not, for in the firmament there is no division of night
and day. It is never dark, except at a certain period, when the planet Nazar comes between
the firmament and the subterranean sun.

On awakening, I found at my side a mean looking monkey, who asserted that he was my colleague:
He had brought with him a false tail, which he fixed upon me, and then tied to it some ribbons
of various colors. He told me that in half an hour the president would be ready to set out
for the Academy, and that I must prepare myself to begin my duties. The ceremony of promoting
a doctor was to take place.

We bore the president to the Academy in a golden sedan, and were suffered to remain in the
hall during the performance.

At the entrance of the president, all the doctors and masters of art rose and turned their
tails towards him. To a dweller on the earth, such salutations would probably have appeared
unseemly and ridiculous, as such a movement with us is expressive of indifference or dislike.

But every land has its own customs. I have seen so many strange ceremonies and varied usages,
that I have come to observe, rather than laugh at them.

The act of promotion, on this occasion, was performed with the following ceremonies. The candidate
was placed in the middle of the hall. Then three officers, each with a pail of cold water,
approached him with measured steps. Each in turn dashed his bucket of water in the candidate's
face. The sufferer is obliged to receive this bath without distorting his countenance, on pain
of forfeiting his degree. Odorous oils were then sprinkled over him, and finally a powerful
vomit was given to him. When this last dose had produced its usual effect upon the candidate,
he was pronounced to be a lawfully graduated doctor.

I turned to a learned doctor, who stood near me, and humbly asked him the meaning of all I
had seen.

First expressing his pity for my ignorance, the sneering pedant condescended to inform me,
that the ceremony of the water was significant of the preparation for a new course of life
and duty; the ointment, of elevation above the mass; and the vomit, of the extermination of
prejudice and error.

I fancied, but I did not say so, that my dignified instructor in the mysteries needed a fresh
vomit.

The Martinianic religion is not at all practical. There are two hundred and thirty speculations
concerning the form and being of God, and three hundred and ninety-six of the nature and qualities
of the soul. There are many churches and theological seminaries, but in neither is taught the
way to live and die well. The people are all critics, who go to be amused by the art and delicacy
of the holy teachers. The more obscure and involved the propositions of their preachers, the
more are they praised. The Martinians are indifferent to every thing they can easily understand.

Martinia is the paradise of project-makers. The more inconsistent and useless a scheme, the
surer is it of general approbation.

When I once spoke with an enthusiastic monkey, of the earth and its inhabitants, he fell upon
the notion, to bore through to the surface, and make a convenient and easy way of communication.

He prepared a long and eloquently worded plan on this subject, which pleased and excited every
body.

A company was formed, and named the "Subterranean Boring Company" its originator, Hiho Pop-coq,
was made its president. The stock was seized on with avidity, and the project was not abandoned
until a multitude of families had been ruined, and the public affairs brought into the greatest
disorder; and even then the scheme was dropped, less from its supposed impracticability, than
from the length of time required to accomplish it.

The author of it was not only left unpunished, but was overwhelmed with the general applause,
for the originality and boldness of his attempt.

The Martinians are used to console themselves on such occasions, by repeating the following
couplet:

    "The project ended in defeat;
    The notion was, however, neat."

When I had thoroughly studied the character of this people, I determined to take advantage
of their weaknesses, and by some outrageous proposal, to gain their respect, and thereby better
my condition.

I revealed my intention to a shrewd old monkey, who encouraged me in these words:

    Who would succeed in Martinianic land,
    Must quit the useful, to propose the grand;
    Hazard those deeds, that to the gallows pave,
    Thy fortune's made! Here's honor for the knave.

After due deliberation, my choice became fixed upon that ornament for the head, called wigs by us.

I had previously noticed that the land contained a multitude of goats; with the hair of these
creatures I proposed to manufacture my wigs.

My step-father had been engaged in the trade, and as I had, with the inquisitiveness of youth,
observed the process, I could bungle at it.

I made a goat's-hair wig for myself, and adorned with it, presented myself to the president.

This dignitary was astonished at the new and uncommon decoration. He seized it from my head,
and placing it on his own, hastened in a very undignified manner to the mirror.

So enraptured was he at the sight of the pompous protuberance, that he shrieked out: "Divine
art, how like a God am I!"--he sent immediately for her Grace to partake in his joy.

She was not less pleased than her lord. She embraced him, kissed him, and assured him that
she had never seen him more handsome.

The president addressed himself to me with much less haughtiness than usual. "O Kakidoran!"
he exclaimed, "if this discovery of yours pleases the Council as well as it does me, your fortune
is made. You may hope for the most honorable reward the State can give."

I gracefully thanked his Excellency, and immediately wrote a petition, which I requested him
to lay before the Council.

His Excellency took the petition together with the wig, and departed. I understood that all
the cases which were to come before the Council on this day, had been laid aside, so inquisitive
were all to hear and examine my project. The work was accepted, and an appropriate reward was
adjudged to me. I was called up to the council-chamber on my entrance, an old monkey stood
up, and, after thanking me in the name of the whole republic, proclaimed that my work should
be rewarded as its merits deserved. He then demanded, what length of time I should need to
fabricate another such head ornament? I replied, that it was reward enough for me, that my
curious workmanship had gained the approbation of the great men who composed the Council; for
the rest, I bound myself to make another wig in two days, and also to manufacture wigs enough
for the whole city in a month, provided I might count upon the assistance of a number of monkeys,
accustomed to work. This proposal, however, made the president hot about the ears, and he exclaimed
with much eagerness: "It is not fit, my dear Kakidoran, that this ornament should be common
to the whole town, for being worn by all without distinction, it will become ordinary and vulgar.
The nobility must necessarily be distinguished from the common people."

All the members of the Council concurred in his opinion, and the city marshal was charged to
take heed that none might wear wigs, except the nobility. This order having been promulgated,
the citizens thronged about the council-chamber to obtain titles and charters, which some bought
with their money and others procured through the influence of their friends; so that in a short
time full half the city were made nobles. But when petition after petition poured in from the
provinces, that the like favor should be extended to them, the Council, being possessed with
a righteous fear of riot and civil war, finally determined to allow every one, without distinction
of rank, to wear a wig. I thus had the pleasure to see the whole Martinianic nation wigged
before I left that country. And, truly, it can scarcely be imagined what a funny and ridiculous
appearance the wigged monkeys presented! The whole nation made so much of my project and its
accomplishment, that a new era was established; and from this time the wig-age commenced in
the Martinianic annals.

In the meantime, I was loaded with praises and panegyrics, wrapped in a purple cloak, and returned
from the court-house in the president's own sedan, the same porteur, who had formerly been
my companion, serving me now as a horse. From that day I dined continually at the table of
his Excellency.

With this glittering preamble to my fortunes, I commenced in earnest the work I had promised,
and soon finished wigs enough for the whole Council; and after sweating for a month--a patent
of nobility was brought to me, couched in the following words:

     "In consideration of the most excellent and very useful
     discovery, through which Kakidoran, born in Europe, has made
     himself worthy of the gratitude of the whole Martinianic
     nation, we have resolved to advance him to the rank of
     nobility, so that he, and all his descendants shall be
     regarded as true noblemen, and enjoy all the prerogatives
     and rights, of which the nobility of Martinia are in
     possession. Furthermore, we have determined to dignify him
     with a new name; he shall therefore from this day, be no
     longer called Kakidoran, but Kikidorian. Moreover, since his
     new dignity requires a richer style of living, we grant him
     a yearly pension of two hundred patarer. Given in the
     council-chamber of Martinia, the fourth day of the month
     Merian, under the great seal of the Council."

Thus I suddenly became changed from a simple porteur to a respectable nobleman, and lived for
a long while in great splendor and honor. When it was known that I was high in the favor of
the president, everybody sought my good will and protection. It is the fashion among the poets
of Martinia to panegyrize the tails of eminent monkeys, as it is with us to eulogize the beauty
of women. Several poets commended the beauty of my tail, although I had none. To say everything
on this subject in a few words--their fawning servility towards me was so extreme, that a certain
man of high rank and station, did not hesitate, nor did he feel himself shamed, to promise
me that his wife should make herself agreeable to me in every possible way, provided that I
would recompense him by recommending him to the president.

When I had lived in this land for the space of two years, at first a porteur and latterly a
nobleman, an incident, entirely unexpected, occurred, which was nearly fatal to me. I had,
up to this period, been in special favor with his Excellency; and her Grace, the president's
lady, had evinced so much kindness to me, that I was regarded the first among all her favorites.
She was distinguished for her virtue; but, when in the lapse of time, I perceived one after
another ambiguity in her expressions, I began to feel a kind of mistrust, especially when I
observed that

    Sometimes she'd smile with wanton grace,
    Then unto sudden tears give place,
    While gazing, silent, on my face
              With mild devotion.
    Her's all the art of tenderness,
    That pleases while it wounds no less:
    Her breasts, half-covered, now confess
              Their strange emotion.
    Then sighs that can no reason find,
    Or used to make my reason blind:--
    Her hands upon her breast entwined--
              Ah, female charms!
    Her face would lose its rosy hue
    For lily's, washed in morning dew;
    Aurora's purple blazed anew,
              In love's alarms.

My suspicions finally became certainties, when a chambermaid brought to me, one day, the following
note:

     "DEAREST KIKIDORIAN,--

     "The feeling which I owe to my rank and high descent, and
     the modesty natural to my sex, have until now hindered the
     sparks of love which have long secretly burned in my bosom,
     from breaking forth in open flame: but I am weary of the
     combat, and my heart can no longer resist its bewitching
     enemy. Have pity for a female, from whom only the utmost
     degree of burning love could have been able to extort a
     confession.

     PTARNNSA."

I cannot describe how singularly I felt at this entirely unexpected declaration of love: but
as I held it far better to expose myself to the revenge of a furious female, than to sin against
the order of nature, by a shameful intimacy with a creature that did not belong to my race,
I immediately wrote an answer in the following words:

     "GRACIOUS LADY,--

     "The constant favor his Excellency, your husband, has shown
     to me; the undeserved benefits he has bestowed upon me; the
     moral impossibility of fulfilling your gracious desires; and
     many other reasons, that I will not name, move me to submit
     to the anger of my gracious lady, rather than consent to an
     action that would stigmatize me as the most ungrateful and
     the lowest among all two-legged creatures. Besides, what is
     desired of me, would be more bitter to satisfy than death
     itself. This action, if I yielded to it, would effect the
     ruin and dishonor of one of the most respected families in
     the State, and my willingness would injure, before all
     others, that person who has desired it. With the most solemn
     and sincere assurances of gratitude I must here declare,
     gracious lady, that under no circumstances can I fulfil your
     wishes in this respect, although to all other commands I
     promise a blind obedience.

     KIKIDORIAN."

Underneath I wrote the following admonition:

    "Think of this heavy sin;
      Fly ere it be too late:
    Shall vice, the pander, newly in,
      Bow virtue to the gate?
    Let Cupid not ensnare you--
      His cunning wiles beware you,
    The sweets of sin soon vanish--
      Its pains, ah! who can banish."

This letter I sent to the lady, and it had the effect that I expected; her love was changed
to the bitterest hatred:--

    In vain her glowing tongue would vie,
    To tell her frightful agony.
    Despairing shame her accents clip;--
    They freeze upon her snowy lip.
    No tears did flow; such pain oft dries
    The blessed current of the eyes:
    Fell vengeance from her black orbs glanced,
    While like a fury, she advanced.

Nevertheless, she restrained her fury, until she recovered the love-letter she had written
to me. As soon as she had secured it, she hired some persons to testify by oath, that, in the
absence of his Excellency, I had attempted to violate her. This fable was represented with
so much art and speciousness, that the president did not doubt its truth, and I was ordered
to be put in prison. In this, my despairing condition, I saw no other means of deliverance
than to confess the crime, with which I had been charged, and supplicate the president for
mercy: which being done, my life was conceded, but I was doomed to perpetual imprisonment.
My charter of nobility was immediately taken from me, and I was sent to the galleys as a slave.
My destination was to one of the ships belonging to the republic, which then lay ready to sail
for Mezendares, or the Land-of-wonders. Thence were brought the wares that Martinia cannot
produce. This ship, on board of which my evil fortune had now cast me, was propelled both by
sails and oars; at each oar two slaves were chained: consequently I was attached to another
unfortunate. I was consoled, however, by the prospect of a voyage, during which I hoped to
find new food and nourishment for my insatiable inquisitiveness, although I did not believe
all that the seamen told of the curious things I should see. Several interpreters accompanied
us; these being made use of by the Mezendaric merchants in the course of their commercial negotiations.

CHAPTER XI.

THE VOYAGE TO THE LAND-OF-WONDERS.

Before I proceed to the description of this sea-voyage, I must first caution all severe and
unmerciful critics not to frown too much at the narration of things, which seem to war against
nature, and even surpass the faculties of faith in the most credulous man. I relate incredible
but true things, that I have seen with my own eyes. Raw and ignorant ninnies who have never
started a foot from their homes, regard every thing as fable, whose equal they have never heard
of or seen; or, with which they have not been familiar from childhood. Learned people, on the
contrary, especially those who have a deep knowledge of natural history, and whose experience
has proved to them how fruitful nature is in changes, will pass a more reasonable sentence
upon the uncommon things narrated.

In former days a people were found in Scythia, called Arimasps, who had but one eye, which
was placed in the middle of the forehead: another people, under the same climate, had their
foot-soles turned out backwards, and in Albany were people born with gray hairs. The ancient
Sanromates ate only on every third day and fasted the other two; in Africa were certain families
who could bewitch others by their talk; and it is a well known fact, that there were certain
persons in Illyria, with two eye-balls to each eye, who killed people by merely looking at
them: this, however, they could do, only when they were angry; then their fierce and scintillating
stare was fatal to whomever was rash or unfortunate enough to meet it: on the mountains of
Hindostan were to be found whole nations with dog's heads, who barked; and others who had eyes
in their backs. Who would believe this and even more, if Pliny, one of the most earnest writers,
had not solemnly assured us, that he had neither heard nor read the least hereof, but had seen
it all with his own eyes? Yes, who would have imagined that this earth was hollow; that within
its circumference were both a sun and moon, if my own experience had not discovered the secret?
Who would have thought it possible, that there was a globe, inhabited by walking, sensible
trees, if the same experience had not placed it beyond all doubt? Nevertheless, I will not
pick a quarrel with any one, on account of his incredulity in this matter, because I must confess,
that I myself, before I made this voyage, mistrusted whether these tales might not have arisen
from the exaggerated representations of seamen, or that they were the result of that well-known
qualification of this class of men, familiarly styled the "spinning a yarn."

In the beginning of the month Radir, we went on board our ship, weighed anchor, and

    The wind in swelling sails embraced the bending masts,
    And, like an arrow in the air, with lightning speed,
    The keel shrieked through the foaming billows.

The wind was fair for some days, during which we poor rowers had a comfortable time, for the
oars were not needed; but on the fourth day it fell calm;

    The sails did fall: in haste the seats were fixed;
    With plashing stroke, the oars smote heaven in the waters.

For a long time we met with nothing; but as soon as we lost sight of land, strange figures
raised themselves from the quaking gulph. They were mermaids, who, when the weather becomes
calm and the billows rest themselves, rise to the surface and swim towards any passing ship,
to ask for alms. Their language was so similar to the Martinianic, that some of our sailors
could speak with them without an interpreter. One of these singular creatures demanded of me
a piece of meat; when I gave it to her, she looked at me steadily for a time, and said: you
will soon become a hero, and rule over mighty nations! I laughed at this divination, for I
considered it empty flattery, although the sailors swore to it, that the mermaids' prediction
seldom failed. At the end of eight days we came in sight of land; which the seamen called Picardania.
As we entered the harbor, a magpie came flying towards us, which, they said, was the custom-house
inspector-general. When this dignitary had flown thrice around the ship, he returned to the
shore and came back with three other magpies: these seated themselves on the prow of the ship.
I came very near bursting with laughter, when I saw one of our interpreters approach these
magpies, with many compliments, and heard him hold a long conversation with them. They had
come for the purpose of examining our freight and detecting any forbidden articles that we
might have concealed; when all was found correct, we were suffered to unload. As soon as this
was done, a number of magpies flew to the ship, who proved to be merchants. The captain then
went ashore, accompanied by myself and two monkeys, namely, our supercargo and an interpreter;
after clearing the ship and disposing of the cargo, we returned, and shortly set sail.

In three days we reached Music-land. After casting anchor, we went on shore, preceded by one
of the interpreters, who carried a bass-viol in his hand. As we found the whole country about
us empty and desolate, discovering no where any trace of living creatures, the captain ordered
a trumpet to be sounded, to inform the inhabitants of our arrival. Before the echoes of the
blast from the trumpet had subsided, (and they seemed to penetrate farther and reverberate
longer than usual from the perfect stillness of this apparently void region,) about thirty
musical instruments came hopping towards us. These were bass-viols. On the very long neck of
each was placed a little head; the body was also small, and covered by a smooth bark, which,
however, did not close entirely around the frame, but was open in front and disposed loosely
about them. Over the navel, nature had built a bridge, above which four strings were drawn.
The whole machine rested on a single leg, so that their motion was a spring rather than a walk.
Their activity was very great, and they jumped with much agility over the fields. In short,
we should have taken them for musical instruments, as their general appearance purported, if
they had not had each two arms and hands. In the one hand was a bow, the other was used upon
the frets. When our interpreter would converse with them, he put his viol in its position,
and commenced playing an air. They immediately answered him by touching their strings, and
thus alternating with each other, a regular musical conversation was carried on. At first they
played only Adagio, with much harmony; then they passed over to discordant tunes; and finally
concluded with a very pleasant and lively Presto. As soon as our people heard this, they leaped
and sung for joy, saying, that the bargain for the wares was now fixed. Afterwards I learnt
that the Adagio, they first played, was merely an opening or preface to the conversation, and
consisted only of compliments; that the discordant tones which followed, were bickerings and
disputes about prices; and, finally, that the sweet sounding Presto indicated that an agreement
had been made. At the conclusion of these negotiations, the wares stipulated for were landed.
The most important of these is Kolofonium, with which the inhabitants rub their bows or organs
of speech.

Late in the month of Cusan, we set sail from Music-land, and after some days sailing hove in
sight of a new land, which, on account of the foul smell that reached our noses at a great
distance, our seamen supposed to be Pyglossia.

The inhabitants of this land are not very unlike the human race in their general appearance;
the sole difference being, that these people have no mouth: they speak from the face which
turns towards the south when the nose points to the north. The first of them who came on board,
was a rich merchant. He saluted us after the custom of his nation, by turning his back towards
us, and immediately began to bargain with us for our wares. I kept myself considerably remote
during the negotiation, as neither the sound nor the smell of his speech pleased me. To my
great horror our barber was taken sick at this time, so that I was obliged to summon a Pyglossian
perfume. As the barbers here are quite as talkative as among us, this one, while shaving me,
filled the cabin with so disagreeable a smell, that, on his departure, we were obliged to smoke
with all the incense we had on board.

We sailed hence to Iceland. This land consisted of desolate rocks, covered by eternal snows.
The inhabitants who are all of ice, live here and there in the clefts of the rocks on the tops
of the mountains, where the sun is never seen, enveloped by almost perpetual darkness and frost.
The only light they have comes from the shining rime.

These lands, of which I here have given a view, are all subject to the great emperor of Mezendora
proper, and are therefore called by seafaring people the Mezendoric islands. This great and
wonderful country, namely, Mezendora, is the goal of all extended voyages. Eight days sail
from Iceland brought us to the imperial residence. There we found all that realized, which
our poets have fancied of the societies of animals, trees and plants; Mezendora being, so to
speak, the common father-land of all sensible animals and plants. In this empire each animal
and every tree can obtain citizenship, merely by submitting to the government and laws. One
would suppose, that, on account of the mixture of so many different creatures, great confusion
would prevail among them: but this is far from the case. On the contrary, this very difference
produces the most happy effects; which must be attributed to their wise laws and institutions,
decreeing to each subject that office and employment to which his nature and special faculties
are best fitted. Thus, the lion, in consideration of his natural magnanimity, is always chosen
regent. The elephant, on account of his keen judgment, is called to sit in the State-council.
Courtiers are made of chameleons, because they are inconstant and know how to temporize. The
army consists of bears, tigers and other valorous animals; in the marine service, on the contrary,
are oxen and bulls; seamen being generally hardy and brave people; but severe, inflexible,
and not particularly delicate in their living, which corresponds very well with their element.
There is a seminary for this class, where calves or sea-cadets are educated for sea-officers.
Trees, for their natural discretion and gravity, are usually appointed judges: counsellors
are geese; and the lawyers of the courts in ordinary are magpies. Foxes are generally selected
as ambassadors, consuls, commercial-agents, and secretaries-of-legation. The ravens are chosen
for dealing-masters and executors on the effects of those deceased. The buck-goats are philosophers,
and especially grammarians, partly for the sake of their horns, which they use on the slightest
occasion, to gore their opponents, and partly in consideration of their reverend beards, which
so notably distinguish them from all other creatures. The staid yet energetic horse has the
suffrage for the mayoralty and other civil dignitaries. Estate owners and peasants are serpents,
moles, rats and mice. The ass, on account of his braying voice, is always the leader of the
church-choir. Treasurers, cashiers and inspectors are commonly wolves; their clerks, being
hawks. The (roosters) cocks are appointed for watchmen, and the dogs house-porters.

The first who came on board of us, was a lean wolf or inspector, the same as a custom-house-officer
in Europe, followed by four hawks, his clerks. These took from our wares what pleased them
best, proving to us thereby that they understood their business perfectly, and had all its
appropriate tricks at their fingers' ends. The captain took me ashore with him. As soon as
we had set foot on the quay, a cock came towards us, demanded whence we were, the nature of
our cargo, and announced us to the inspector-general. This latter received us with much courtesy,
and invited us to dine with him. The mistress of the house, whom I had heard to be one of the
greatest beauties among the female wolves, was not present at the table: the reason of this
was, as we afterwards learned, her husband's jealousy, who did not deem it advisable to allow
such a handsome wife to be seen by strangers. There were, however, several ladies at table;
among others, a certain commodore's wife, a white cow with black spots: next to her sat a black
cat, wife to the master of hunt at court, newly arrived from the country. At my side was placed
a speckled sow, the lady of a renovation-inspector: that species of officer-ship being generally
taken from the hog-race. It must be observed that the inhabitants of the Mezendoric empire,
although they are animals in figure, have hands and fingers on the fore feet.

After dinner the speckled sow entered into conversation with our interpreter, during which
she told him that she was overhead and ears in love with me. He comforted her in the best manner
he could, and promised her his support and aid; then he turned himself towards me and endeavored
to persuade me to be easy; but when he observed that his flattering and arguments were vain,
he advised me to take to flight, as he knew that this lady would move heaven and earth to satisfy
her desires. From this time I remained constantly on board; but the ship itself was not a fortification
sufficiently secure from the attacks of this lady, who by messengers and love-letters strove
to melt the ice that surrounded my heart. Had I not, in the shipwreck I afterwards suffered,
lost my papers, I should now give some specimens of the swine's poetry. I have forgotten it
all, except the following lines, in which she praises her being thus:

    O thou! for whom my too fond soul most ardently doth thirst,
    For whom my earliest passion, in retirement I have nursed:
    Think not my figure homely, though it be endued in bristles,--
    What beauty hath the leafless tree, through which the cold wind
        whistles?
    How unadorned the noble horse, when of his beauteous mane he's shorn!
    O! who would love a purring cat, all in her furlessness forlorn.
    Ah, look around my darling pig! look on all living things,
    From the huge unwieldy mammoth to the smallest bird that sings;--
    Were these not shagged or feathered all, how loudly should we jeer;--
    Who would warmly strive to please e'en man, were man without a beard?

After our truck was finished and a rich freight stowed away, we sailed for home. We had scarcely
got into the open sea when it suddenly became calm, but soon after the wind breezed up. Having
sailed awhile with a good wind, we saw again some mermaids, who

                                 --dripping wet
    Shot forth, and dived between the foaming waves,

and now and then emitted horrible shrieks. The sailors were much terrified at this, for they
knew by experience, that these mournful sounds were presages of storm and wreck. They had scarcely
taken in the sails, before the whole heavens became veiled in black clouds:

    Day sinks in night: all nature shudders.
    Then, in an instant, loose from every point
    The storm, in frightful gusts and devilish uproar
    Breaks; the axis of the globe grates fearful,--
    And thunders, clap on clap, resound the concave:
    The waves, din-maddened, tower to mountains.
    Wildly, gone her helm, the half-crushed craft
    Tumbles ungovernable. Now despairing shrieks
    Mingling with ocean's roar and crash of heaven,
    Rise from the peopled deck: 'tis finished!

Every movable thing on deck floated off, for besides the ever-rolling billows, an immense rain
fell in terrific water-spouts, accompanied by thunder and lightning. It seemed as though all
the elements had conspired for our destruction. During the rolling of the ship, our masts were
carried away, and then all hope of salvation was gone. Now and then a huge billow rolled over
us, and carried with it one or two men far beyond the ship. The storm raged more and more;
no one cared longer for the vessel: without helm, without masts, without captain and mates,
who had been washed overboard, the wreck lay at the pleasure of the waves. Having floated thus
for three days, a bauble for the storm, we finally descried a mountainous land in the distance.
While rejoicing in the hope of soon reaching this haven, our vessel struck so hard against
a blind rock, that she was instantly dashed in pieces. In the confusion and terror of the moment
I got hold of a plank, and, careless for the rest, thought only upon saving myself, so that
even now I know nothing of the fate of my companions. I was quickly driven forth by the billows;
and this was fortunate for me, for otherwise I should have been crushed among the timbers of
the ship or torn in pieces by the jagged rocks upon which we had been cast, or escaping this
should eventually have perished from hunger and fatigue. I was wafted by the waves within a
cape, where the sea was calmer, and where the roaring of the excited ocean sounded less frightfully.
When I saw that I was near the shore, I began to scream vigorously, hoping to call the inhabitants
to my assistance. I soon heard a sound on the seashore, and saw some of the natives come from
a wood near by; they got into a yawl and sailed towards me; this boat being curiously fashioned
of ozier and oak-branches twisted together, I concluded that this people must be very wild
and uncultivated. I was heartily glad, when I found them to be men, for they were the first
human beings I had met during the whole voyage. They are very like the inhabitants of our globe,
who live in hot climates; their beards are black and their hair curled; the few among them
who have long and light hair, are considered monsters. The land which they inhabit is very
rocky: from the curved ridges of the rocks and the connecting tops of the mountains, which
cut the air in multiplied sinuosities, every sound reverberates in echo upon echo from the
dales below. The people in the yawl approached the plank upon which I floated, drew me from
it, carried me to the shore, and gave me to eat and drink. Although the food did not taste
very good, yet as I had fasted for three days, it refreshed me very much, and in a short time
I regained my former strength.

CHAPTER XII.

THE AUTHOR'S ARRIVAL IN QUAMA.

Meanwhile a large multitude of people collected around me from all parts. They requested me
to speak; but as I did not understand their language I could not answer them. They repeated
often the word Dank, Dank, and supposing them to be Germans, I addressed them in this language,
then in Danish, and finally in Latin; but they signified to me, by shaking their heads, that
these languages were unknown to them. I tried at last to declare myself in the subterranean
tongues, namely, in Nazaric and Martinianic; but it was in vain.

After having addressed each other, thus incomprehensibly for a long time, I was carried to
a small hut, formed of wickers intricately twisted. In this hut were neither chairs nor tables;
these people seat themselves on the ground to eat; instead of beds they spread straw on the
earthy floor, upon which they throw themselves indiscriminately at night. Their food is milk,
cheese, barley-bread and meat, which they rudely broil on the coals; for they do not understand
cooking. Thus I lived with them, like a dog, until I learned so much of their language, that
I could speak with them and assist them a little in their ignorance. The simplest rules of
living that I prepared for them were considered as divine commands. My fame soon spread abroad,
and all the villages around sent forth crowds to a teacher, who, they believed, had been sent
to them from heaven. I heard even, that some had commenced a new chronology from the date of
my arrival. All this pleased me only so much the more, as formerly in Nazar I had been abused
for my imprudence and wavering judgment, and in Martinia despised and commiserated for my ignorance.
True, indeed, is the old proverb; that among the blind the one-eyed rules. I had now come to
a land, where with little understanding, I could raise myself to the highest dignities. There
were here the best opportunities to employ my talents, since this fruitful land produced in
abundance whatever subserved for pleasure and luxury as well as usefulness and comfort. The
inhabitants were not indocile nor were they wanting in conception; but since they had been
blessed with no light without themselves, they groped in the thickest darkness. When I told
them of my birth, my native land, of the shipwreck I had suffered, and of other occurrences
in my voyages, not one would credit me. They thought rather that I was an inhabitant of the
sun, and had come down to enlighten them, wherefore they called me Pikil-Su, that is the sun's
ambassador. For their religion, they believed in and acknowledged a God, but cared not at all
to prove his existence. They thought it enough for them that their forefathers had believed
the same; and this blind submission to time-honored formulæ was their simple and sole theology.
Of the moral law, they were ignorant of all commandments save this: Do not unto others that
which you would not have others do unto you. They had no laws; the will of the emperor was
their only rule. Of chronology they had but a slight conception; their years were determined
by the eclipses of the sun by Nazar's intervention. Were one asked his age, he would answer:
that he had attained so many eclipses. Their knowledge of natural science too, was very unsatisfactory
and unreasonable; they believed the sun to be a plate of gold, and the planet Nazar, a cheese.
Their property consisted in hogs, which, after marking, they drove into the woods: the wealth
of each was determined by the number of his swine.

I applied myself, with all the fervor imaginable, to refine and enlighten this rude, yet promising
people, so that shortly I came to be regarded among them as a saint; their trust in my wisdom
was so great, that they thought nothing impossible with me. Therefore, when overtaken by misfortune,
they would hasten to my hut and pray for my assistance. Once I found a peasant on his knees
before my door, weeping, and bitterly complaining over the unfruitfulness of his trees, and
beseeching me to use my authority, that his trees should bear fruit to him abundantly, as of old.

I had heard that this whole country was governed by a Regent, whose residence, or palace, at
that time, was about eight days' travel from the town where I lived. I say at that time, because
the court dwelt, not in substantial, fixed houses, but in tents; and the residence was moved
at pleasure from one province to another. The ruler at that period was an old man, named Casba,
which signifies, the great emperor. In consideration of its many large provinces, this country
was indeed a great empire; but, from the ignorance of the inhabitants, who made little use
of their many natural advantages, and also from the absence of that unanimity among the provinces,
which would have dignified and strengthened their counsels, and subserved for their mutual
protection, they were exposed to the attacks and mockeries of their more vigorous neighbors,
and not unfrequently obliged to pay tribute to nations much inferior to themselves.

The report of my name and power was spread in a short time even to the remotest provinces.
Nothing could be done without consulting me, as an oracle, and when any undertaking miscarried,
its failure was ascribed to my indifference or indignation; wherefore, oblations were frequently
made to assuage my anger. Finally the rumor was carried to the ears of the old emperor, that
a great man had come into his dominions, in a strange dress, who gave himself out as ambassador
of the sun, and had proved himself more than man, by bestowing to the Quamites (thus the inhabitants
were called, after the name of the land, Quama,) wise and almost divine rules of life. He therefore
sent ambassadors, with orders to invite me to the imperial residence. These were thirty in
number, all clothed in tiger-skins, this dress being considered in Quama the greatest of ornaments,
since none were permitted to wear it, but those who had distinguished themselves in war against
the Tanaquites, a nation of sensible tigers, and the mortal enemies of the Quamites.

I had built, in the town where I dwelt, a walled house, after the European style. At the sight
of it, the imperial ambassadors were astonished, and exclaimed that it was a work beyond human
powers; they entered it, as a sanctuary, with devout reverence, and there proclaimed to me
the emperor's invitation in the following speech: "Since the great emperor, our most gracious
lord, reckons his genealogy through manifold generations, from Spunko, the sun's son, the primary
regent of Quama, nothing could surprise him more agreeably than this embassy; wherefore his
majesty joyfully greets the ambassador of the sun, and humbly invites him to the capital city
of the empire." I answered by expressing my most humble thanks for the emperor's condescension,
and immediately repaired, with the ambassadors, to the capital. These lords had been fourteen
days on their journey to me, but assisted by my genius, the return occupied only four days.

I had observed, during my residence in this country, that there were vast numbers of horses
running wild in the woods, and hence rather burthensome than useful to the inhabitants. I showed
to the people how beneficial these animals might be made to them, and taught them how to tame
these noble creatures. At my suggestion and by my direction, a number of them were caught and
broken in, and thus I was enabled to mount the ambassadors, and materially shorten the period
of our journey.

No idea can be formed of the wonder and astonishment with which the Quamites witnessed our
entry into the city; some were so frightened that they ran far into the country. The emperor
himself dared not, in his fear, come out from his tent, nor would he stir, until one of the
ambassadors, dismounting his horse, went in and explained the whole secret to him. Shortly
I was, with a great retinue, led into the imperial tent. The old emperor was seated on a carpet
surrounded by his courtiers. On my entrance, I acknowledged, in the most polite terms, the
exceeding grace his imperial majesty had shown me; thereupon the emperor arose and asked me
what the king of the sun, and father of his family proposed to do. Conceiving it politic, and
even necessary not to undeceive the Quamites in the opinion they themselves first entertained,
I answered: that his majesty, the king of the sun, had sent me down to this land to refine,
by good laws and salutary rules of life, the uncultivated manners of the Quamites, and teach
them the arts, through which they might not only resist and repel their valiant and energetic
neighbors, but even extend the boundaries of their own empire; and added, that I had been ordered
to remain with them forever. The emperor listened to this speech with much apparent pleasure,
ordered a tent to be immediately raised for me near his own, gave me fifteen servants, and
treated me less as a subject than as an intimate friend.

CHAPTER XIII.

THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH MONARCHY.

From this time all my exertions were directed to the accomplishment of a radical reform throughout
the country. I commenced by improving their mode of warfare, in exercising the young men in
riding, fencing and shooting. My constant labor was rewarded so well that, in a short time,
I exhibited before the emperor six thousand horsemen.

At this period the Tanaquites were preparing for a new attack upon the Quamites, on account
of the refusal of this latter people to pay a yearly tribute which had been several times demanded
and as often denied. I went, at the emperor's desire, with my cavalry and some footmen to meet
the invaders. To the infantry I gave javelins and arrows, that they might fight their enemies
at a distance; for the Quamites had formerly used only short swords or poignards, and consequently
were obliged to meet in close combat their frightful foes, the Tanaquites, who excelling them
greatly in personal strength, had great advantage over them. Hearing that the enemy were approaching
the boundary, as commander-in-chief, I repaired instantly towards them. On meeting the invaders
I caused the footmen to attack them with their javelins; this put them into panic and flight,
and determined the fate of the day. The enemy suffered a terrible defeat and the Tanaquitic
leader, with twenty other noble tigers, were taken prisoners alive and carried in triumph to
Quama. It is not possible to describe the general and tumultuous joy that filled the whole
country for this glorious victory; because in former wars the Quamites had generally been obliged
to lay down their arms. The emperor commanded the prisoners to be immediately executed, according
to old custom; but considering this a horrible custom, I persuaded him to respite them, and
put them in prison for further deliberation.

I had observed that this land was very rich in saltpetre, and had collected a considerable
quantity for the purpose of making powder. This intention I had kept secret, however, from
all except the emperor, whose permission I needed to establish manufactories for rifles and
other guns. With the aid of these I hoped in a short time to subdue all the enemies of the
empire. When I had finished some hundred rifles and prepared balls suitable for them, I made
a trial of my project to the astonishment of all. A certain number of soldiers were selected
to learn this military art, and were exercised in the management of the guns. When this body
of soldiers had become accustomed to the use of these new engines of war, and could employ
them effectively, a review was held, after which the emperor proclaimed me Jakal, that is,
generalissimo over the whole army. While all these matters were pending, I had entered into
an intimate friendship with the brave leader of the Tanaquites, the imprisoned Tomopoloko,
with whom I held frequent and interesting conversations, with the object of learning the constitution,
character, and customs of his nation. I could not but observe, to my great astonishment, that
they were a witty, moral and enlightened people, and that the sciences were earnestly and effectively
cultivated by them. The chief told me, that towards the east were a valorous people, against
whose attacks, the Tanaquites were obliged to keep themselves always prepared. The inhabitants
of that country, he added, were small, and in reality much inferior in bodily strength to those
of Tanaquis; but being of superior acuteness and agility, and excellent bowmen, they had in
fact, often forced the Tanaquites to sue for peace.

I soon came to know, that this formidable nation consisted of cats; and that they had distinguished
themselves among all the nations under the firmament, for their rational judgment and political
acumen. It provoked and pained me not a little, that skilfulness, the sciences, and polite
manners, should be universally among the animals of the subterranean world, while only real
human beings, namely, the Quamites were sunk to the profoundest depths of uncultivated barbarism.
I consoled myself, however, in the hope that, through my endeavors, this shame would soon cease,
and the Quamites would recover that dominion, which belonged to them as men over all other animals.

Since their last defeat, the Tanaquites kept very quiet for a long time; but when they found
out the nature and condition of our cavalry; when they discovered that those centaurs, who
had frightened them so terribly at first, were nothing in reality, but tamed horses with men
seated upon them, they took courage and armed new troops against the Quamites, under the command
of their king. Their whole army consisted of twenty thousand tigers, all veteran soldiers,
heroes of many hard fought fields, except two regiments of new recruits; these hastily collected
warriors were, however, more formidable in name and numbers than in service. Already sure of
victory, they fell at once upon Quama. I immediately ordered against them twelve thousand infantry,
among whom were six hundred musketeers, and four thousand horsemen. As I had not the slightest
doubt of a fortunate termination to this expedition, I requested the emperor to take command
of it, and thus reap the honor of the victory. By this appearance of modesty, I lost no respect,
for the whole army still considered me the true leader. I first directed my cavalry against
the enemy, but these were resisted with so much vigor, that the side of victory was for a long
time doubtful: at the critical moment, when triumph was vacillating between the two powers,
I detached my musketeers from the main body and advanced upon the foe. The Tanaquites were
much astonished at the first shots, for they could not conceive whence came the thunder and
lightning; but when they saw the mournful effects of our continued volleys, they became terrified;
at the first discharge fell about two hundred tigers, among which were two chaplains, who were
shot down while encouraging the soldiers to bravery. When I observed the panic among the enemy,
I commanded a second discharge, whose results were more fatal than the former; their king himself
was shot: then the Tanaquites took to flight; our cavalry followed them, and cut down so many
of the flying multitude, that those in the rear could not proceed from the huge piles of slain
that covered the way. When the battle was over, we counted the killed of the enemy and found
them to be thirteen thousand: our own loss was comparatively very slight. The victorious army
marched into the kingdom of Tanaqui and encamped before its capital. The general terror had
meanwhile increased so much, that the magistrates submissively met the conquerors and delivered
the keys of the city. The capital surrendering, the whole country soon followed its example.
The disregard and contempt in which the Quamites had to this time been held, were changed to
admiration and fear: the empire, with the addition of the newly conquered kingdom, was extended
to twice its former size.

The glory of these actions was with one voice ascribed to my superior knowledge and untiring
industry; and the esteem which had been long cherished for me, now passed over to a reverent
and divine worship. This period of general peace and exultation, I thought a fitting time to
advance the civilization and refinement of the Quamites, and as a practical commencement to
this great work I ordered the royal Tanaquitic library to be moved to Quama.

My curiosity to become acquainted with this library had been at first excited by the imprisoned
leader Tomopoloko, who told me that among its manuscripts was one, whose author had been up
to our globe, in which history of his travels he had described several of its kingdoms, particularly
those of Europe. The Tanaquites had seized this manuscript during one of their predatory excursions
into a distant land; but as the author had concealed his name, they knew not what countryman
he was, nor in what manner he had passed up through the earth. The quaint title of this book
was: "Tanian's[2] Travels Above-ground; being a description of the kingdoms and countries there,
especially those of Europe." From the antiquity of this work together with its great popularity,
it had become so ragged, that what I was most anxious to learn, namely, the narration of the
author's journey to our earth and his return, was most unfortunately lost. Here is the contents
of this singular manuscript, such as I found it:

     "Fragments of Tanian's Diary, kept on a Voyage
     above-ground, Translated by his Excellency, M. Tomopoloko,
     General-in-chief, in the Service of his Tanaquitic
     majesty."

       *       *       *       *       *

"This land (Germany) was called the Roman empire; but it has been an empty title, since the
Roman monarchy was demolished several centuries since. The language of this land is not easy
to understand, on account of its perverted style; for, what in other languages is placed before,
in this comes after, so that the meaning cannot be had before a whole page is read through.
The form of government is very inconsistent; some think they have a regent and yet have none;
it should be an empire, yet it is divided into several duchies, each of which has its own government,
and often engages in a formal war with its neighbor. The whole land is called 'holy,' although
there is not to be found in it the least trace of piety. The regent, or more correctly the
unregent, who bears the name of emperor, is denominated 'the continual augmenter of his country,'
although he not seldom diminishes it; 'invincible,' notwithstanding he is often slain: sometimes
by the French, sometimes by the Turks. One has no less reason to wonder at the people's rights
and liberties; but although they have many rights, they are forbidden to use them. Innumerable
commentaries have been written upon the German constitution, but notwithstanding this, they
have made no advance because

       *       *       *       *       *

"The capital of this country (France) is called Paris, and is very large, and may in a certain
degree be considered the capital of all Europe; for it exercises a peculiar law-giving power
over the whole continent. It has, for example, the exclusive right to prescribe the universal
mode of dress and living; and no style of dress, however inconvenient or ridiculous, may be
controverted after the Parisians have once established it. How or when they obtained this prescriptive
right is unknown to me. I observed, however, that this dominion did not extend to other things;
for the other nations often make war with the French, and not seldom force them to sue for
peace on very hard terms; but subservience in dress and living nevertheless continues. In quickness
of judgment, inquisitiveness after news, and fruitfulness of discovery, the French are much
like the Martinians.

       *       *       *       *       *

"From Bologna we went to Rome. This latter city is governed by a priest, who is held to be
the mightiest of the kings and rulers of Europe, although his possessions may be travelled
through in one day. Beyond all other regents, who only have supremacy over their subjects'
lives and goods, he can govern souls. The Europeans generally believe that this priest has
in his possession the keys of heaven. I was very curious to see these keys, but all my endeavors
were in vain. His power, not only over his own subjects, but the whole human race, consists
principally in that he can absolve those whom God condemns, and condemn those whom God absolves;
an immense authority, which the inhabitants of our subterranean world seriously believe is
not becoming to any mortal man. But it is an easy matter to induce the Europeans to credit
the most unreasonable assertions, and submit to the most high-handed assumptions, notwithstanding
they consider themselves alone sensible and enlightened, and, puffed up with their foolish
conceits, look contemptuously upon all other nations, whom they call barbarous.

"I will not, by any means, defend our subterranean manners and institutions: my purpose simply
is, to examine those of the Europeans, and show how little claim these people have to find
fault with other nations.

"It is customary, in some parts of Europe, to powder the hair and clothes with ground and sifted
corn; the same which nature has produced for the nourishment of man. This flour is called hair-powder.
It is combed out with great care at night, preparatory to a fresh sprinkling in the morning.
There is another custom with them, which did not appear less ridiculous to me. They have certain
coverings for the head, called hats, made ostensibly, to protect the head from the weather,
but which, instead of being used for this very reasonable purpose, are generally worn under
the arm, even in the winter. This seemed as foolish to me as would the instance of one's walking
through the city with his cloak or breeches in his hand; thus exposing his body, which these
should cover, to the severity of the weather.

"The doctrines of European religion are excellent and consistent with sound reason. In their
books of moral law they are commanded to read the Christian precepts often; to search into
their true meaning, and are advised to be indulgent with the weak and erring. Nevertheless,
should any understand one or another doctrine of these books in any but the established sense,
they would be imprisoned, lashed, yes, and even burned for their want of judgment. This seemed
to me the same case, as if one should be punished for a blemish in sight, through which he
saw that object square which others believed to be round. I was told that some thousand people
had been executed by hanging or burning, for their originality of thought.

"In most cities and villages are to be found certain persons standing in high places, who animadvert
severely upon the sins of others, which they themselves commit daily: this seemed to me as
sensible as the preaching of temperance by a drunkard.

"In the larger towns, it is almost generally the fashion to invite one's guests, immediately
after meals, to imbibe a kind of sup made from burnt beans, which they call coffee. To the
places where this is drunk, they are drawn in a great box on four wheels, by two very strong
animals; for the higher classes of Europeans hold it to be very indecent to move about on their
feet.

"On the first day of the year, the Europeans are attacked by a certain disease, which we subterraneans
know nothing of. The symptoms of this malady are a peculiar disturbance of the mind and agitation
of the head; its effects are that none can remain, on that day, five minutes in one place.
They run furiously from one house to another, with no appreciable reason. This disease continues
with many even fourteen days; until at last, they become weary of their eternal gadding, check
themselves and regain their former health.

"In France, Italy and Spain, the people lose their reason for some weeks, in the winter season.
This delirium is moderated by strewing ashes on the foreheads of the sufferers. In the northern
parts of Europe, to which this disease sometimes extends, and where the ashes have no power,
nature is left to work the cure.

"It is the custom with most Europeans, to enter into a solemn compact with God, in the presence
of witnesses, three or four times a year, which they invariably and immediately break. This
compact is called 'communion,' and seems to have been established only to show that the Europeans
are used to break their promises several times each year. They confess their sins and implore
the mercy of God, in certain melodies, accompanied by instrumental music. As the magnitude
of their sins increases, their music becomes louder: thus fluters, trumpeters and drummers
are favorite helpers to devotion.

"Almost all the nations of Europe are obliged to acknowledge and believe in the doctrines,
which are contained in a certain 'holy book.' At the south the reading of this book is entirely
forbidden; so that the people are forced to credit what they dare not read; in these same regions,
it is likewise austerely forbidden to worship God, except in a language incomprehensible to
the people; so that, only those prayers are held to be lawful and pleasing to God, which are
uttered from memory, without comprehension.

"The learned controversies which occupy the European academies, consist in the discussion of
matters, the development of which is productive of no benefit, and in the examination of phenomena,
the nature of which is beyond the reach of the human mind. The most serious study of a European
scholar, is the consideration of a pair of old boots, the slippers, necklaces and gowns of
a race long extinct. Of the sciences, both worldly and divine, none judge for themselves, but
subscribe blindly to the opinions of a few. The decisions of these, when once established,
they cling to, like oysters to the rocks. They select a few from their number whom they call,
'wise,' and credit them implicitly. Now, there would be nothing to object against this, could
raw and ignorant people decide in this case; but to decide concerning wisdom requires, methinks,
a certain degree of sapience in the judge.

"In the southern countries, certain cakes are carried about, which the priests set up for Gods;
the most curious part of this matter is, the bakers themselves, while the dough yet cleaves
to their fingers, will swear that these cakes have created heaven and earth.

"The English prefer their liberty to all else, and are not slaves, except to their wives. Today
they reject that religion, which yesterday they professed. I ascribe this fickleness to the
situation of their country; they are islanders and seamen, and probably become affected by
the variable element that surrounds them. They inquire very often after each other's health,
so that one would suppose them to be all doctors; but the question: how do you do? is merely
a form of speech; a sound without the slightest signification.

"Towards the north, is a republic, consisting of seven provinces. These are called 'united,'
notwithstanding there is not to be found the least trace of union among them. The mob boast
of their power, and insist upon their right to dispose of state affairs; but no where is the
commonalty more excluded from such matters; the whole government being in the hands of some
few families.

"The inhabitants of this republic heap up great riches with anxious and unwearied vigilance,
which, however, they do not enjoy: their purses are always full, their stomachs always empty.
One would almost believe they lived on smoke, which they continually suck through tubes or
pipes, made of clay. It must, nevertheless, be confessed, that these people surpass all others
in cleanliness; for they wash everything but their hands.

"Every land has its own laws and customs, which are usually opposed to each other. For example;
by law, the wife is subject to the husband; by custom, the husband is ruled by the wife.

"In Europe, the superfluous members of society only are respected; these devour not only the
fruits of the land but the land itself. The cultivators of the soil, who feed these gorges
are degraded for their industry and despised for their usefulness.

"The prevalence of vice and crime in Europe may perhaps be fairly inferred from the great number
of gallows and scaffolds to be seen everywhere. Each town has its own executioner. I must,
for justice sake, clear England from this stigma; I believe there are no public murderers in
that country: the inhabitants hang themselves.

"I have a kind of suspicion that the Europeans are cannibals; for they shut large flocks of
healthful and strong persons in certain inclosures, called cloisters, for the purpose of making
them fat and smooth. This object seldom fails, as these prisoners, free from all labor and
care, have nothing to do but to enjoy themselves in these gardens of pleasure.

"Europeans commonly drink water in the morning to cool their stomachs; this object accomplished,
they drink brandy to heat them again.

"In Europe are two principal sects in religion; the Roman catholic and the protestant. The
protestants worship but one God; the catholics, several. Each city and village, with these,
has its appropriate God or Goddess. All these deities are created by the pope, or superior
priest at Rome, who, on his part, is chosen by certain other priests, called cardinals. The
mighty power of these creators of the creator of the gods, does not, as it would seem to an
indifferent spectator, apparently alarm the people.

"The ancient inhabitants of Italy subdued the whole world, and obeyed their wives; the present,
on the contrary, abuse their wives and submit to the whole world.

"The Europeans generally feed upon the same victuals with the subterraneans. The Spaniards
alone live on the air.

"Commerce flourishes here and there; many things are offered for sale in Europe, which with
us are never objects of trade. Thus in Rome, people sell heaven; in Switzerland, themselves;
and in * * * * * * *, the crown, sceptre and throne are offered at public auction.

"In Spain, idleness is the true mark of a well-bred man; and the distinguishing proof of pure
nobility is an aptitude to sleep.

"Among European writers, those are in the highest repute, who change the natural order of words,
making that which is in itself simple and distinct, intricate and incomprehensible. The class
most noted for this abominable perversion of style is that of the 'poets:' this singular removal
of words is called 'poetry.' The capability to puzzle is by no means the only requisite to
become a true poet; one must be able to lie most terribly. A certain old poet named Homerus,
who possessed both these qualities in an eminent degree, is styled the 'master,' and is idolized
with a kind of divine worship. He has had many imitators of his distortion of sentences and
falsification of truth; but, it is said, none have yet reached his excellence.

"The cultivators of science purchase books in great quantities, not so much, I am told, for
the sake of the contents, as for their antiqueness of style or elegance of binding.

"The learned and unlearned are distinguished from each other by different dresses and manners;
but especially by different religions: the latter believe mostly in one God; the former worship
many divinities, both male and female. Among the principal of these are, Apollo, Minerva, and
nine muses; besides many lesser whole and half Gods. The poets particularly implore their aid
and 'hail' them when they take a notion to rage.

"The learned are divided, according to their different studies into the classes of philosophers,
poets, grammarians, natural philosophers, metaphysicians, &c.

"A philosopher is a scientific tradesman, who, for a certain price, sells prescriptions of
self-denial, temperance and poverty; he generally preaches the pains of wealth, till he becomes
rich himself, when he abandons the world for a comfortable and dignified retreat. The father
of the philosophers, Seneca, is said to have collected royal wealth.

"A poet is one who makes a great stir with printed prattle, falsehood and fury. Madness is
the characteristic of the true poet. All those who express themselves, with clearness, precision
and simplicity are deemed unworthy of the laurel wreath.

"The grammarians are a sort of military body, who disturb the public peace. They are distinguished
from all other warriors, by dress and weapons. They wear black instead of colored uniforms,
and wield pens rather than swords. They fight with as much obstinacy for letters and words
as do the others for liberty and father-land.

"A natural philosopher is one who searches into the bowels of the earth, studies the nature
of animals, worms and insects, and, in a word, is familiar with every thing, but himself.

"A metaphysician is a sort of philosopher, partly visionary and partly sceptical, who sees
what is concealed from all others. He describes the being and unfolds the nature of souls and
spirits, and knows both what is, and what is not. From the acuteness of his sight, the metaphysician
cannot discern what lies directly before his feet.

"I have thus briefly considered the condition of the learned republic in Europe. I could relate
many other things, but I think I have given the reader a sufficient test, by which he may judge
how far the Europeans have a right to hold themselves preëminent for wisdom.

"The people above-ground are exceedingly pious, and extraordinarily zealous in praying. Their
prayers, however, do not arise from the impulses and emotions of their hearts; but are subdued
to mere matters of form, directed by bells, clocks or sun-dials. Their devotion is entirely
mechanical, founded on external signs and old customs rather than in sincere feeling.

"When I came to Italy, I fancied myself master over the whole country; for every one called
himself my slave. I took a notion to test the extent of this humble obedience, and commanded
my landlord to lend me his wife for a night; he became very angry, however, at this, and ordered
me out of his house.

"In the north, there are many people who seek with great pains to obtain titles of offices
which they do not hold; and many lose their reason in their eagerness to be on the right side.
Furthermore,"

       *       *       *       *       *

Here I lost my patience. Inflamed to the utmost fury, I threw the book on the ground, and assured
Tomopoloko, who was by me, that it was the fiction of an unjust and choleric writer. When my
first passion was cooled, I reviewed my sentence, and finally concluded that the author of
these travels, although unfair and untrue in many particulars, had nevertheless made some good
points and happy reflections.

I will now return to civil affairs. All our neighbors had kept very quiet for a long period,
and during this peace I made every effort to constitute the government according to my own
notions, and strengthen the army in numbers and efficiency.

Suddenly, we received information that three warlike and formidable nations, namely, the Arctonians,
Kispusiananians and Alectorians, had united against the Quamites. The first named were bears
gifted with reason and speech. The Kispusiananians were a nation of large cats celebrated for
their cunning and ferocity. The Alectorians were cocks, armed with bows and arrows. These arrows
with poisoned tips, were cast with wonderful precision, and their least touch was fatal.

These three nations had been irritated by the uncommon progress of the Quamites as well as
by the fall of the Tanaquites. The allied powers sent ambassadors to Quama, to demand the liberty
of the imprisoned Tanaquitians and the cession of their land, with power to declare war should
the same be denied. By my advice, they were immediately dismissed with the following answer:
"Since the Tanaquitians, violators of peace and alliance, have deserved the misery which they
have brought upon themselves by their own folly and pride, his majesty, the emperor, is determined
to defend, to the utmost, the possessions of a land, conquered in a lawful war, in spite of
the threats and fearless of the strength of your unnatural alliance."

In a short time I had an army of forty thousand men ready for the coming war: among these were
eight thousand horsemen and two thousand riflemen. The emperor, old as he was, determined to
follow this campaign; his eagerness and ambition were so great, that neither his wife's representations
nor mine were effective enough to induce him to abandon this intention.

In this state of affairs, I was made somewhat uneasy from mistrust of the Tanaquitians. I feared
that, impatient of their unaccustomed slavery, they would take the first opportunity to throw
off their yoke, and go over to the enemy. I did not deceive myself; for immediately after the
declaration of war, we heard that full twelve thousand Tanaquitians in complete armor, had
marched for the enemy's encampment. Thus were we occupied at once with four mighty foes.

In the beginning of the month Kilian, we commenced our march. From a spy, we learnt that the
united troops had already besieged the fort Sibol in Tanaqui, on the borders of Kispusianania.
On our arrival before the place, they abandoned the siege and prepared to meet us. The battle
took place in a dale near the fort, and is to this day called the "Sibolic battle."

The Arctonians, who formed their left wing, made great havoc among our cavalry; and, supported
by the rebellious Tanaquites, fell furiously on our right; a moment longer and the fate of
the conflict would have been determined. I detached a body of riflemen to engage the attention
of the enemy, and allow the cavalry to recover; this movement was very effective; the men handled
their guns well, and the enemy hastily abandoned their ground, under a terrific shower of balls.
Meanwhile, the Kispusiananians on the other side pressed our infantry very hard; six hundred
Quamites were down: some killed, others mortally wounded. The recovered cavalry now rushed
upon them impetuously, broke their ranks, and, unresisted, slaughtered them by thousands.

The Alectorians, who formed the reserve, gave us the greatest trouble, for when our soldiers
would attack them, they flew into the air, whence they shot on our heads their poisoned arrows.
One of these entered the neck of the old emperor, while fighting vigorously in the midst of
the field. He fell directly from his horse, was carried to his tent, and shortly after expired.
The soldiers having been kept in ignorance of their sovereign's death, the battle was continued
until midnight. I soon found that our balls had but little effect upon our flying enemies;
their motions being so rapid that our gunners could take no aim. Some new method must be devised
to check them; a lucky expedient occurred to me; I ordered the guns to be loaded with small
shot: these scattering, brought them down in great flocks, and soon half of them were destroyed;
the rest laid down their weapons and surrendered. The Arctonians and Kispusiananians quickly
followed their example, and their fortifications were surrendered to our hands.

    When all these things were fortunately brought to an end,
    Behold then I called together the first among the people, the eldest,
    The heads of all the troops, to Council, in full assembly;
    Like the bubbling ocean's high-roaring billows
    They all did stream to me; and silently heard my speech:

"Noble, brave and celebrated warriors. I doubt not, that it is well known to the most of you,
that I ofttimes advised his majesty not to hazard his precious life in this desperate strife.
But his natural courage and fearless heroism would not suffer him to remain at home, while
his brave people exposed themselves abroad. O, that he could have witnessed our glorious victory!
Then our entrance into the imperial residence would have been a true triumph, and our joy over
so many noble deeds would have been perfect; not as now, mingled with tormenting sorrow! I
can no longer conceal from you the mournful event, which has given each one of us, a greater
wound than could all the arrows of the enemy. Know then, that our emperor, in the thickest
of the battle, was struck by an unfortunate arrow, and soon after expired. Horrible event!
What sorrow, what general mourning will the loss of this great king cause over the whole country!
Yet, do not lose courage! The great hero has ceased to live in himself; but he is not dead
to you! Your emperor lives again in two princes, true images of their great father, and heirs
no less to his virtues than to his dignities. You have not changed your emperor, but only your
emperor's name. Since the prince Timuso, as the first born, receives the crown, I am, from
this moment, under his sceptre, the leader of the army.

"Hail, Timuso! To him let us swear allegiance! To him, let us swear eternal loyalty! Him, let
us all hereafter obey!"

CHAPTER XIV.

THE AUTHOR BECOMES A MONARCH UNDER THE GROUND.

When my speech was ended, they all cried out with loud voices: "We will have Pikil-Su, for
emperor." When I heard this, I became terrified, and begged them, with tears in my eyes, not
to forget the fidelity and duty they owed to the imperial family. But my words were of no use.
They all approached me, and placed the crown upon my head, repeating the above-mentioned exclamation.
I was then carried from the tent and proclaimed before the whole army, emperor of Quama, king
of Tanaqui, Arctonia and Alectoria, and duke of Kispusianania. Afterwards we made a triumphal
entry into the capital, where prince Timuso, himself acknowledged me for emperor. Thus, from
a miserable, shipwrecked wretch, I became a great and powerful monarch. I soon married the
daughter of the deceased emperor, for the people still loved and honored the old royal family.
This princess was named Ralac, and

    Bloomed, like the new-blown rose
    In mellowed, purple-smile.

when I had reduced to order the affairs of the empire, and firmly established myself on the
throne, I thought of new means, by which I might extend my dominions, and render my power fearful
to the whole subterranean world. I turned my attention to a navy, and soon had a fleet of twenty
ships on the sea.

I soon came to regard myself an under-ground Alexander; and determined to make myself as famous
as he had on our globe. I concluded to sail first for Mezendore and thence to Martinia. We
set sail at that period of the year, when the planet Nazar is of the middle size, and in a
few days came in sight of the Mezendoric coast.

I immediately sent ambassadors to the imperial residence, of whom was demanded in the name
of the emperor,

    "What their purpose; whence they came
    Over the foaming billows of the swelling main."
     We humbly make known, that it is concluded in the
     unchangeable councils of heaven, that all the empires and
     kingdoms of the world must surrender themselves to the power
     of Quama; and as the will of providence is irrevocable, your
     kingdom must necessarily submit to fate. We therefore
     advise you to surrender voluntarily yourself and your
     dominions, rather than foolishly resist our invincible
     phalanx, and thereby experience all the bloody horrors of
     war.

     "Given from our fleet, the third day in the month Rimat."

In a few days our ambassadors returned with a bold and haughty answer. I made a descent upon
the coast, placed my army in battle array, and sent spies to examine the condition of the enemy.
The spies came back in great haste, and related that an immense army, of sixty thousand in
number, consisting of lions, tigers, elephants, bears and birds of prey, was drawing towards
us. We were soon apprised of their near approach, by roars, shrieks and terrific cries, commingling
a devilish tumult. The combat soon commenced, and truly, 'twas one of the hottest and most
contumaceous, in which I ever engaged: at last we put them to flight.

In this engagement fell thirty-three thousand Mezendarians, and about four thousand were made
prisoners. We followed our victory, and drew before the capital city; this we besieged both
by land and sea. So energetic was our blockade, that the enemy quickly proposed a parley, and
sent ambassadors to ask for peace on reasonable conditions. The emperor offered to me his daughter,
the handsomest of the lionesses, in marriage, and the half of his empire as a dowry. These
conditions, although very honorable, were very displeasing to me, for I considered it both
unsafe and illicit to forsake my wife, whom I left behind in pregnancy, and marry a lioness.
I therefore sent back the ambassadors without answer.

I now ordered my cannon to be directed against the wall, which, although built of stone, was
soon rent. The emperor lost all hope and surrendered himself together with all his lands. After
putting a garrison in the capital, I took the emperor on board my own ship, and laid my course
for Martinia, the coast of which we reached after a long but fortunate voyage.

We obtained here the same success as elsewhere. When the Martinians submitted, I determined
to include their neighbors under the same yoke. As I was preparing to effect this, ambassadors
from four adjacent countries arrived, and voluntarily acknowledged allegiance to me. I now
possessed so many kingdoms, that I did not deem it worth my trouble to ascertain the names
of these; but included them all under the title of the Martinianic "dominion."

CHAPTER XV.

A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE FORTUNES OF THE AUTHOR.

Having made so many and extraordinary warlike excursions, and added to our fleet a number of
Martinianic ships, we set sail for our own land, into which we entered with a splendor exceeding
the old Roman triumphs. And really my deeds deserved all possible honors; for what heroic action
could be greater and more glorious than to change a despised nation, a nation exposed to the
insults of its weaker neighbors, to the acknowledged and respected ruler of the whole subterranean
world? What could be more honorable to a man, than to reinstate the human race in that dominion,
which nature has given to it, over all other animals?

From this time a new period may be reckoned in history; a fifth monarchy can be added to the
glorious roll of splendid empires. To the Assyrian, Persian, Greek and Roman empires, the Subterranean-Quamatic
monarchy, which unquestionably exceeds them all in magnificence and power, may not be considered
unworthy to be joined. I could not decline, for obvious reasons, the title of Koble, or great,
with which the conquered nations saluted me.

I was hailed thereafter, by the following titles: "Niels the Great, Ambassador of the Sun,
Emperor in Quama and Mezendore, King of Tanaqui, Alectoria, Arctonia, the Mezendoric and Martinianic
dominions, Grand Duke of Kispusianania, Ruler of Martinia, etc. etc."

               ----firmly founded, stood
    The mighty empire; the favorite of fortune,
    I seemed as firmly fixed; not one, alas!
    May be deemed happy 'till his latest hour.

When I had reached this splendid and powerful height, greater than any man should desire, I
became, what men usually become, who are raised from a simple state to great honor in the world.
I forgot my former condition, and inclined to vanity. Instead of exerting myself to retain
the favor of the people, I proved myself cruel and rigorous to all classes. My subjects, whom
I had formerly endeared by friendly and polite conduct, I now regarded and treated as slaves.
For this course, I came soon to be despised; the love and reverence of my people were changed
to indifference and fear. Their sentiments towards me I soon had reason to understand, when
I issued a proclamation to the inhabitants.

The occasion was this: the empress, whom I left in pregnancy during my last expedition, had
in my absence been delivered of a son. This prince I wished to have nominated as my successor.
I therefore summoned a Diet, and commanded the Quamitian nobles and the great men among the
conquered nations, to meet in the capital, at the crowning of the child. None dared to disobey
this proclamation, and the coronation passed off with great magnificence; but I observed by
the countenances of my subjects, that their joy was dissembled. I became more confirmed in
my mistrust, when I learnt that a multitude of libels had been spread about. These libels,
by unknown authors, criticised me very severely, and asserted that prince Timuso was insulted
in the choice of my son. This enraged me so much that I could not rest until that noble and
excellent prince should be removed from my path. I therefore suborned some persons to accuse
him of treason; and since rulers seldom want assistants, when they would commit crimes, I was
quickly enabled to prove that Timuso had attempted my life. I had him sentenced to death by
bribed judges, and then threw him into prison, where he was privately murdered; for I feared
to excite a rebellion by a public execution. I had determined to murder the younger prince
likewise; but postponed it. His youth procured for him the safety, which neither my justice
nor humanity would have granted him. Having once imbued my hands in innocent blood, my cruelty
and moroseness knew no bounds. I doomed to death several whole families, whose loyalty I merely
suspected. Not a day passed without bloodshed. I defiled my soul with the blood of innocence,
virtue and nobleness. All these things hastened a rebellion, excited by the nobles, who had
been long disgusted with me.

I will here acknowledge, that I deserved all the misfortunes that afterwards met me. It had
certainly been more fit for a Christian king to have taught his ignorant and heathen subjects
to know the true God, and to have given them an example in my own person of the sweet charities
of the true religion, than to have excelled, even themselves in barbarity, sin and moral turpitude.
It would have been an easy matter for me to have reformed the whole subterranean world, for
whatever I commanded was fulfilled; whatever I determined was received in perfect good faith;
whenever I spoke, my words were as those of a God. But I forgot God and myself; I thought of
nothing but empty and vain splendor, and the augmentation of my power; wherefore I perpetrated
many cruelties, until the people, unable to bear more, (and they were a patient people,) broke
out against me.

While matters stood thus, I determined to lay hands on prince Hidoba. This intention I revealed
to my high-chancellor, Kalak, in whom I had great confidence. He promised to be of service
to me in all things, and departed to fulfil my order: but at heart, he detested my cowardly
fears, and left me only to discover my plot to the prince. Together they repaired to the fort,
collected the garrison, and represented, in a touching manner, their danger and my fears. The
tears of the unfortunate prince gave weight to his words; all seized their arms, and promised
that they would hazard their lives for him. The cunning chancellor took the opportunity to
persuade them to swear loyalty to the prince, and sent messages to others, who, he knew, were
displeased with me, to take arms against the tyrant.

    All armed themselves, whose hearts, through fear and horror,
    Did burn towards their country's tyrant; they met

and united with the garrison, while I awaited the return of the chancellor.

       *       *       *       *       *

By the advice of Pomopoloko, I fled seasonably to Tanaqui, leaving my own capital before the
inhabitants generally were apprised of the immediate cause of the sudden out-break. Arrived
in Tanaqui, I quickly collected an army of forty thousand men, and boldly retraced the steps
which a few days before I had pursued in fear and trembling. I had little doubt that my powers
would be augmented by Quamites, who had been either too remote to suffer from my cruelty, or
too indifferent to my infamy, to hesitate in joining a force so overpowering, and a leader
whose prospects were so brilliant as mine. But I was deceived in my hopes: instead of auxiliaries
a herald from the prince met me. The object of his mission was to declare a formal war, and,
for a commencement of hostilities, that my wife and son had been imprisoned. On the footsteps
of the herald came the Quamitic forces. A bloody engagement took place, in which our part proved
to be inferior. I, left to my fate, fled to a neighboring mountain, crossed its side and descended
to a dale behind it. There I remained in concealment for some time, bemoaning, the while, my
misery, as I then believed, but which I afterwards more justly named, my folly. I was so agitated,
had so thoroughly lost that presence of mind for which I had in former days been distinguished,
that I did not remove from my head the crown, which, being ornamented with sunbeams, would
have easily betrayed me. While panting like a bayed lion, I heard a nestling on the other side
of the mountain, which I supposed was made by men beating the bushes to discover any hiders.
I now looked around for a more secure retreat, for I doubted not that my flight had been noticed,
and that these pursuers would search on my side of the mountain. Behind me was

    ----A thick and matted forest, sunk between hills
    All desolate and bare, whose dark and awful silence
    Beckoned me.

I hurried thither, fiercely flinging aside the thorny bushes that clung as fiercely to me,
and came at last to the mouth of a cave. Creeping in, I observed that the cave was deep, and
as far as the light penetrated, level. I determined to explore its recesses, though I think
I should not have been so hardy in my days of fortune.

After treading cautiously a hundred paces, I suddenly lost my footing, and plunged with the
quickness of lightning, into a hole that must have had perpendicular sides.

Having shot through this passage, the abode of palpable darkness and night, I suddenly perceived
a faint light.

    As when through clouds the moon doth gleam
    With pallid smile.

As this light increased, my speed decreased, so that without pain or trouble, I was soon brought
to a stand between two high mountains. My sensations, during this remarkable passage, were
similar to those experienced while tossing among the billows of the ocean. On recovering, I
found myself, to my great astonishment, in the same spot from which, years before, I had plunged
into the subterranean regions. A moment's reflection gave me the means to account for the decrease
of speed in the latter part of my course. The weight of the atmosphere is much greater on the
surface of the globe, than below; consequently I was buoyed up by the increasing resistance
of the air towards the surface. Had this not been the case, I should, unquestionably, at least
in my own mind, have shot off to the moon.

Still, being obnoxious to cavil, I will defer this hypothesis to the astronomer's closer examination.

CHAPTER XVI.

THE AUTHOR'S RETURN TO HIS FATHER-LAND, AND THE END OF THE FIFTH MONARCHY.

Although perfectly sensible, my limbs were entirely benumbed; and I lay helpless for a long
time. Meanwhile I ruminated on my singular course. The events of the past years rose one after
another with clearness in my mind; particularly those of my exaltation and fame. Here was I,
the late founder of the splendid fifth monarchy, metamorphosed to a poor and hungry bachelor-of-arts;
a change so terrible and unprecedented, that it might well have disturbed the strongest brain.
I seriously examined my present circumstances--were they real? or did I dream? Alas? the tremors
of terror and uncertainty only gave place to the pangs of sorrow and regret.

    "Almighty Father!" I exclaimed, and towards heaven
    Stretched my trembling hands, "what sin provoked thy vengeance,
    That all thy thunders crash upon my head?
    Where am I? whence came I? how shall I escape
    Thy anger."

Truly! should one look over the journals of all times, he will neither in ancient nor modern
history find a parallel to so great a fall; with the single exception of that of Nebuchadnezzar,
who from the greatest of kings was changed to a dumb beast.

I began to descend the mountain by the path which leads to Sandvig. When about half way down,
I observed some boys, whom I beckoned towards me, repeating the words: Jeru pikal salim, which
in the Quamitic language signify: show me the way. The lads, however, were apparently frightened
at seeing a man in a strange dress, and with a hat on his head glittering with golden rays;
for they rushed down the mountain in great haste, arriving at Sandvig an hour before me. The
rumor of the strange appearance on the mountain was spread about and caused terror throughout
the town; the notion was, that the shoemaker of Jerusalem wandered among the mountains. This
impression arose thus: the boys on being questioned by the townsmen, replied that I had told
them who I was. I afterwards learnt that my words, Jeru pikal salim, had been interpreted by
sound, and that this clew, acted upon by fear and superstition, had been developed into the
strangest of fables. This story was unquestioned by this simple people, inasmuch as the adventures
of the travelling shoemaker were then newly reported, and it had been asserted that he had
been seen a short time before in Hamburg.

When, towards evening, I entered Sandvig, I observed that the inhabitants were collected in
large flocks, to gaze at me. As I approached them and spoke, they all took to flight, except
one old man: him I addressed, and begged of him to give me lodging at his house. He asked me,
"where I was born, whence I came, &c." I answered him, with a sigh: "When I come to your house,
I will relate events that will seem incredible to you, and whose equals you will not find in
any history." The old man then took me by the hand and led me to his house. When there I demanded
drink; he gave me a glass of beer. When I recovered my breath, after this draught, I addressed
the old man thus: "You see before you a human being, who has been a bolt for the changing winds
of fortune; one, who has been pursued by a fatality more controlling and more unhappy than
was ever experienced by mortal."

"Moral and physical revolutions may be effected in a moment, without surprising men; but what
has befallen me is beyond the reach of human imagination!"

"It is the traveller's fate;" my landlord answered; "many strange events and changes might
happen on a voyage of sixteen hundred years."

I did not understand this, and requested him to tell me what he meant by sixteen hundred years.
He replied: "If one may believe history, it is now sixteen hundred years since Jerusalem was
destroyed, and I doubt not, venerable man, that you were already of age at its destruction.
If what is said of you is true, you must have been born in the reign of Tiberius. I know that
this matter is rather supposed than proved. The inhabitants of this place, however, believe
you to be the shoemaker of Jerusalem, celebrated in history, who, since the time of Christ,
has travelled about the world. Nevertheless, the more I look at you, the greater resemblance
I find to an old friend of mine, who twelve years since perished on the top of a neighboring
mountain." At these words, I looked carefully at my host. In a moment the fog was cleared from
before my eyes. I saw before me my dear friend Abelin, in whose house, at Bergen, I had spent
many happy days. I ran to his embrace with outstretched arms. "Then 'tis you, my dear Abelin!
I can scarcely believe my eyes. Here you see Klim again, who has just returned from the subterranean
world. I am the same, who twelve years since plunged into the mountain cave." He fell upon
my neck and with tearful eyes, demanded where I had been and what had happened to me. I told
him all that had occurred. At first he would not credit me; but afterwards he acknowledged
that all must have been so, for I could never have invented such strange adventures.

Abelin advised me not to repeat these things to others, and to keep myself secluded in his
house. He told the people, who rushed to his house to see the "shoemaker of Jerusalem," that
I had vanished; for he justly concluded this to be the best and most satisfactory answer he
could make to an ignorant and superstitious peasantry. I remained in concealment until clothes,
more suitable to the surface of the earth, than those I brought from below, were made, when
Abelin reported me to be a relative of his, lately a student in Trondhjim, on a visit. He recommended
me to the bishop of Bergen, who promised to me the first rectorship that should become vacant.
This office was much to my taste, for it seemed to have a likeness to my former state, a school-master
being a miniature of royalty. The rod may be likened to the sceptre; the desk to the throne.
After waiting for a vacancy in vain, I determined, from necessity, to accept the first office
I could get. At this time the sacristan of the church died; his place was offered to me by
the bishop and accepted. An amusing promotion to one who had lately reigned over many great
kingdoms. Nevertheless, since nothing is so ridiculous as poverty, and since it is foolish
to throw away dirty water, before clean is at hand, I think it would have been still more laughable
to have refused it. Fulfilling the duties of this office, I now live in philosophic ease.

Shortly after my induction, a marriage with a merchant's daughter was proposed to me. I could
have liked the girl, but as it was probable that the empress of Quama was yet alive, I did
not care to make myself obnoxious to the ban of polygamy. M. Abelin, however, into whose bosom
I was used to pour my doubts, and all the pressures of my heart, abridged this fear, and advised
me to marry; which I did. With this wife I have lived six years in peaceful and affectionate
union. During this period she has borne me three fine sons, wholly worthy of their half brother,
the prince of Quama.

To my wife, I never told my subterranean adventures; but I can never forget, for a moment,
the splendor that once surrounded me. To this day, I often express myself in signs and words,
which, however consistent in the mighty ruler and magnificent tyrant, are little adapted to
the humble sacristan of Bergen.

THE SUPPLEMENT OF ABELIN.

Niels Klim lived to the year 1695. His irreprehensible life and amiable disposition endeared
him to all. Yet were the priests now and then angry with him for his great sedateness and reservedness,
which they called pride and haughtiness. I, who knew the man, wondered much at the modesty,
humility and patience with which he, who had been monarch over many nations, executed his mean
and vulgar duties. So long as his strength permitted, he would, at a certain time in the year,
ascend the mountain and gaze into the cave, out of which he came to the surface. His friends
