INTRODUCTION.

Of the revolutions of the age, one of the most interesting and important is that which has
taken place in the forms of Literature and the Modes of its Publication. Since the establishment
of the Edinburgh Review the finest intelligences of the world have been displayed in periodicals.
Brougham, Jeffrey, Sidney Smith, Mackintosh, Macaulay, have owed nearly all their best fame
to compositions which have appeared first in journals, magazines and reviews; the writers of
Tales and Essays have uniformly come before the public by the same means, which have recently
served also for the original exhibition of the most elaborate and brilliant Fictions, so that
we are now receiving through them by almost every ship from Europe installments of works by
Dickens, Bulwer, James, Croly, Lever, Reynolds, Mrs. Marsh, Mrs. Ellis, and indeed nearly all
the most eminent contemporary novelists. So complete is the change, that all mind, except the
heaviest and least popular, is likely to flow hereafter through the Daily, Weekly, Monthly
or Quarterly Miscellanies, which compete with universities, parliaments, churches, and libraries,
for ascendency in the government of mankind.

In this country we must keep pace with the movements abroad. It will not answer that we issue
literary productions as soon as possible after their completion. The impatient readers demand
chapters by chapters, as they are spun from the brain and the heart of the author; facts, upon
the instant of their discovery; and suggestions, as they flash from the contact of imagination
and reflection.

The INTERNATIONAL WEEKLY MISCELLANY will be a result of efforts to satisfy a plain necessity
of the times. It will combine the excellencies of all contemporary periodicals, with features
that will be peculiar to itself.

I. A leading object will be to present the public, with the utmost rapidity and at the cheapest
possible rate, the best of those works in Popular Literature which are appearing abroad in
serials, or in separate chapters. With this view, we print in the first number the initial
portions of the brilliant nautical romance now in course of publication in Blackwood's Magazine,
under the title of "The Green Hand," by the author of the most celebrated fiction of its class
in English literature, "Tom Cringle's Log;" and other works will be selected and carried on
simultaneously, as they shall come to us with the stamp of sufficient merit.

II. The foreign periodicals are continually rich in novelettes of from two or three to a dozen
chapters, which--being too short for separate volumes--are rarely reproduced at all in this
country. Of these the INTERNATIONAL will contain the choicest selections.

III. Of the Quarterly Reviews the most admirable papers will be presented in full; and those
works will in all cases be carefully examined for such valuable and striking passages as will
be likely to interest the American reader, to whom the entire articles in which they appear
may be unattractive.

IV. The Literary, Religious, Political and Scientific newspapers and magazines will be consulted
for whatever will instruct or entertain in their several departments. The leading articles
in the great journals, upon Affairs, and Philosophy, and Art, which are now very unfrequently
reprinted in America, will appear in the INTERNATIONAL in such fullness and combination as
to display the springs and processes of the world's action and condition.

V. But the work will not be altogether Foreign, nor a mere compilation. In its republications
there will be a constant effort to display what is most interesting and important to the American;
and in its original portions it will be supported by some of the ablest and most accomplished
writers in all the fields of knowledge and opinion.

VI. As a Literary Gazette and Examiner, it is believed that it will equal or surpass any work
now or ever printed in the United States. It will contain the earliest announcements of whatever
movements in the literary world are of chief interest to general readers; its Reviews of Books
will be honest and intelligent; and its extracts, when they can be given in advance of the
publication of the works themselves, will be the choicest and most valuable possible. Without
cant or hypocrisy, or the influence of any clique of feeble-minded and ambitious aspirants
in letters, the INTERNATIONAL MISCELLANY will in this respect, the publishers trust, win and
preserve the respect and confidence of all who look to published critical judgments as guides
for the reading or purchase of books.

With a view to the more successful execution of the design to make the INTERNATIONAL MISCELLANY
of the first class in Original Periodical Literature, as well as in Selections and Abstracts
of what is already before the world abroad, contributors have been engaged to represent the
various departments of Science, and to furnish sketches of manners, &c., from other countries,
and the different sections of our own; the proceedings of Learned Societies will be noted;
History, Biography, and Archæology will receive attention; and in foreign and American Obituary,
such a record will be kept as will be of the most permanent and attractive value.

MARTIN FARQUHAR TUPPER.

The recent appearance of some half dozen editions--some of them very beautiful in typography
and pictorial illustrations--of The Proverbial Philosophy of Mr. MARTIN FARQUHAR TUPPER, reminds
us of the observation of Dana, that something "resembling poetry" is oftentimes borne into
instant and turbulent popularity, while a work of genuine character may be lying neglected
by all except the poets. But "the tide of time," says the profound essayist, "flows on, and
the former begins to settle to the bottom, while the latter rises slowly and steadily to the
surface, and goes forward, for a spirit is in it." We are not without the hope that Richard
H. Dana will one day be in as frequent demand as Martin Farquhar Tupper is now.

The merits of this "gentleman of acknowledged genius and sovereign popularity," we have never
been able to discover. If oddity were always originality, if quaintness and beauty were synonymous,
if paradox were necessarily wisdom, we should be ready to grant that Mr. Tupper is a wise,
beautiful and original thinker. But thought, after all, is an affair of mind, and though a
man of genius may write what is far more brilliant than common sense ever is, yet no man can
utter valuable truth on mortal and prudential subjects, unless he possesses a vigorous and
powerful understanding. Now Mr. Tupper's art consists in contriving, not thought, but things
that look like thoughts; fancies, in imitation of truths. The Proverbial Philosophy, in fact,
appears to us one of the most curious impositions we have ever met with. When you first read
one of the aphorisms, it strikes you as a sentiment of extraordinary wisdom. But look more
closely at it; try to apply it; and you will find that it is merely a trick of words. What
flashed upon you as a profound distinction in morals, turns out to be nothing but a verbal
antithesis. What was paraded, as a kind of transcendental analogy between things not before
suspected of resemblance, discovered by the "spiritual insight" of the moral seer, is in fact
no more than a grave clench,--a solemn quibble,--a conceit; arising not from the perfection
of mind, but the imperfection of language. Those conceptions, fabricated by Fancy out of the
materials that Fancy deals in, and colored by the rays of a poetic sentiment, wear the same
relation to truths, that the prismatic hues of the spray of a fountain in the sunshine bear
to the gems which it perhaps outshines. It dazzles and delights, but if we try to apprehend
it we become bewildered; and finally discover that we were deceived by a brilliant phantom
of air. You may admire Mr. Tupper; you may enjoy him; but you cannot understand him: the staple
of his sentences is not stuff of the understanding. Take one of Mr. Tupper's and one of Lord
Bacon's aphorisms; they flash with an equal bravery. But try them upon the glassy surface of
life. Bacon's cut it as if it were air: Tupper's turn into a little drop of dirty water. One
was a diamond, the other but an icicle: one was the commonest liquor artificially refrigerated;
the other was a crystal in form, but in its substance the pure carbon of truth. If these bright
delusions which Mr. Tupper turns out to the wonder and praise of his admirers, were really
thoughts, is it to be supposed that he would go on in this way, stringing them together, or
evolving one out of the other, as a spider weaves its unending line, or as a boy blows soap
bubbles from the nose of a tobacco pipe! Fancies, conceits, intellectual phantoms, may be engendered
out of the mind, brooding in self-creation upon its own suggestions: but truth is to be mined
from Nature, to be wrung from experience, to be seized as the victor's trophy on the battlefield
of action and suffering. The flowers of poetry may bud spontaneously around the meditative
spirit of genius, but the harvest of Truth, though, to be reaped by mind, must grow out of Reality.

RICHARD HENRY WILDE AND DANTE.

It appears that our accomplished and lamented countryman, Richard Henry Wilde, whose "Researches
and Considerations concerning the Love and Imprisonment of Tasso" have been made use of with
so discreditable a freedom by a recent English biographer of that poet, is--if another pretender
prove not less successful--to be deprived also of the fame he earned by his discoveries in
regard to Dante. A correspondent of The Spectator, under the signature of G. AUBREY BEZZI,
writes as follows:--

     "The questions are, what share Mr. Kirkup had in the recovery of
     the fresco of Giotto in the chapel of the Palazzo del Podesta at
     Florence, and whether directly or indirectly I have been the means
     of depriving him, or any of the coöperators in that good work, of
     the merit due to their labors. I shall best enable those who take
     an interest in this matter to arrive at a fair conclusion, by
     giving a short history of the recovery of that beautiful fresco. It
     was Mr. Wilde, and not Mr. Kirkup, who first spoke to me of this
     buried treasure. Mr. Wilde, an American gentleman respected by all
     that knew him, was then in Florence, engaged in a work on Dante and
     his times, which unfortunately he did not live to complete. Among
     the materials he had collected for this purpose, there were some
     papers of the antiquarian Moreni, which he was examining when I
     called one day, (I had then been three or four months in Florence,)
     to read what he had already written, as I was in the habit of doing
     from time to time. It was then that a foot-note of Moreni's met his
     eye, in which the writer lamented that he had spent two years of
     his life in unceasing and unavailing efforts to recover the
     portrait of Dante, and the other portions of the fresco of Giotto
     in the Bargello, mentioned by Vasari; that others before him had
     been equally anxious and equally unsuccessful; and that he hoped
     that better times would come, (verranno tempi migliori,) and that
     the painting, so interesting both in an artistic and historical
     point of view, would be again sought for, and at last recovered. I
     did not then understand how the efforts of Moreni and others could
     have been thus unsuccessful; and I thought that with common energy
     and diligence they might have ascertained whether the painting, so
     clearly pointed out by Vasari, was or was not in existence: several
     months, however, of wearisome labors in the same pursuit taught me
     to judge more leniently of the failures of my predecessors. Mr.
     Wilde put Moreni's note before me, and suggested and urged, that
     being an Italian by birth, though not a Florentine, and having
     lived many years in England and among the English, I had it in my
     power to bring two modes of influence to bear upon the research;
     and that such being the case I ought to undertake it. My thoughts
     immediately turned to Mr. Kirkup, an artist who had abandoned his
     art to devote himself entirely to antiquarian pursuits, with whom I
     was well acquainted, and who, having lived many years in Florence,
     (I believe fifteen,) would weigh the value of Moreni's testimony on
     this matter, and effectually assist me in every way, if I took it
     in hand. So I called upon him, either that same day or the next;
     and I found that he, like most other people, had read the passage
     in Vasari's life of Giotto, in which it is explicitly said, that
     the portrait of Dante had been painted with others in the Palazzo
     del Podesta, and was to be seen at the time the historian was
     writing; but that he had not read, or had not put any confidence
     in, the note of the Florence edition of Vasari published in
     1832--1838, in which it is stated, that the Palazzo del Podesta had
     now become a prison--the Bargello; that the Chapel had been turned
     into a dispensa, (it was more like a coal-hole where the rags and
     much of the filth of the prison was deposited); that the walls of
     this dispensa exhibited nothing but a dirty coating, and that
     Moreni speaks of the painting in some published work; the annotator
     concluding thus--'It is hoped that some day or other we shall be
     able to see what there is under the coating of the walls.' So
     everybody hoped that some day or other the thing would be done, but
     nobody set about heartily to do it; and it is inconceivable to me
     that Mr. Kirkup, who shows in this letter, if it be his, such
     jealousy for the credit of the recovery, should have lived so many
     years in Florence either entirely ignorant of that which every
     shop-boy knew, or knowing there were chances of bringing such a
     treasure to light, that he should have never moved one step for
     that purpose. That Mr. Kirkup took no active part in this matter at
     any time, is quite proved by two admissions I find in the letter of
     your correspondent. He first says, 'I remember that the first time
     I passed to the Bargello to see it, I found Marini on a scaffold,'
     &c. The fact is, that several months had elapsed between the first
     presentation of the memorial and the erection of the scaffold,
     during which Mr. Kirkup admits that he never thought of visiting
     the place, while I had spent hours and hours there, under not very
     pleasant circumstances, and had detected raised aureolas and other
     evidences of old fresco. But he continues--'Marini was permitted to
     return to the work on account of the government; and at that point
     Bezzi returned to England. It was some months afterwards that I
     heard that Marini had found certain figures, and soon afterwards
     the discovery of Dante himself" (sic.) These two passages
     sufficiently show the nature of Mr. Kirkup's labors, and how far he
     was really eager in the pursuit of this object, both during the
     time when I was most deeply engaged in it, and also for 'some
     months' after I had quitted Florence. But to resume: Mr. Kirkup,
     however ignorant, or culpably negligent, or a little of both, he
     might previously have been on the subject, yet when I brought it
     before him, he at once admitted its importance, and made a liberal
     offer of money, if any should be required, to carry out the
     experiment. Thus encouraged by Mr. Wilde and by Mr. Kirkup, I
     sought and found among English, American, and Italian friends and
     acquaintances, many that were ready to assist the plan. Then it was
     that I drew up a memorial to the Grand Duke; not because I am an
     'advocate,' as your correspondent is pleased to call me, for that
     is not the case, but simply because, having taken pains to organize
     the means of working out the common object, the coöperators thought
     that I could best represent what this common object was. In the
     memorial, I stated that, according to what Vasari, Moreni, and
     others had written, it was just possible that a treasure was lying
     hidden under the dirty coatings of the walls of the dispensa in the
     Bargello; that a society was already formed for the purpose of
     seeking with all care for this treasure; that all expenses would be
     gladly borne by the society; that should anything be found, we
     would either leave the paintings untouched, or have them removed at
     our expense to the gallery of the Uffizi, and that we begged of the
     Grand Duke the necessary sanction to begin our operations. The
     answer was favorable, and I was referred to Marchese Nerli, and to
     the Director of the Academy, to make the necessary arrangements.
     Then the real difficulties began: first, I was put off on account
     of the precautions that were to be taken in working in a prison;
     then, the Director was ill, or unavoidably engaged, or absent; I
     found, in short, that the object was to tire me out, and that I had
     to contend with the same power that had defeated Moreni and my
     other predecessors in the attempt. This battle continued many
     months. I have already spoken too much of my share in the pursuit
     of this object, and I will not enter into further details--some of
     them ludicrous--of this contention; but I will say explicitly,
     that, besides his encouragement, and his repeated offers of money,
     (which were not accepted because money was not wanted, at least not
     to any amount, and what was wanted I furnished myself,) Mr. Kirkup
     did not afford me any assistance. At this stage of the business, I
     met indeed with a most valuable ally, without whom I believe I
     should have been beaten; and that was Paolo Feroni, a Florentine
     nobleman and artist, to whom I have before expressed and now repeat
     my best acknowledgments. At the end of this long contention against
     obstacles which often eluded my grasp, the Grand Duke, in
     consequence of a second memorial I presented to him, issued a
     decree appointing a commission to carry out the proposed
     experiments. This commission was composed of two members I had
     myself proposed, viz. the sculptor Bartolini, and the Marchese
     Feroni, of myself, of the Direttore of the Edifizi Pubblici Machese
     Nerli, and of the Direttore of the Accademia delle Arti, the two
     latter ex-officio: further, the decree declines the proposed
     voluntary subscriptions, and places at the disposal of the
     Commissioners a sum of money which proved more than sufficient to
     cover all the expenses of the restoration of the fresco. The
     Commissioners employed the painter Marini, and the happy result of
     his carefulness and ability is now before the world.

     "I will now conclude by asserting, that I had nothing to do with
     what has been said or written at Florence of this recovery, either
     in the Strenna, or at the meeting of the Scienziati, which was
     held in 1841, I believe, and at which the fresco of Giotto was
     naturally a great object of interest. I left Florence in May 1840,
     before the portrait of Dante was actually uncovered, so that I only
     saw a portion of the fresco. I have never heard, or read, or said,
     or written, anything tending to disparage the real coöperation of
     Mr. Kirkup, or of my late lamented friend Mr. Wilde, or of anybody
     else in this matter,--nay, that it was at my request that the
     editor of the English translation of Kugler's Handbook of the
     History of Painting, published in 1842, has in the preface of that
     book mentioned Mr. Kirkup as having assisted materially in the
     recovery. Besides the Marchese Feroni and the artist Signor Marini,
     there are many disinterested witnesses who have stated, and if
     called upon will repeat again, all the material points of my
     narrative; but, better than all, there is now in London an English
     gentleman, whom I am happy to be allowed to call my friend, who was
     in Florence part of the time, and saw with his own eyes the share I
     had in this laborious undertaking, which ought not to have brought
     this bitter contention upon me: he was an intimate friend of Mr.
     Wilde, with whom he had a long correspondence on this very subject,
     after Mr. Wilde's return to America."

We believe Mr. Bezzi is in error as to the incompleteness of Mr. Wilde's Life of Dante. Mr.
Wilde, more than a year before his death, informed us that his work was nearly ready for the
printer; and at the same time he confided to us for perusal his admirable translations of specimens
of Italian Lyric Poets. We hope the descendants of our learned and ingenious friend will place
these works, so creditable to his temper, scholarship, and genius, before the world.

GEORGE CORNEWALL LEWIS.

A work on The Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion has lately attracted much and apparently
well-deserved attention in England. It is by George Cornewall Lewis, M.P. for Herefordshire,
and Under Secretary of State for the Home Department. He is the eldest son of the Right Honorable
Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, Bart., M.P. for Radnor District, was born in London, in 1806, and
received his school education at Eton, which he entered in 1819, and where he was a pupil of
Doctor Hawtrey, the present head master. The Illustrated London News furnishes the following
particulars of his subsequent career:

At Christmas, 1824, he left Eton, and in the following year entered Christ Church, Oxford,
where as a student he was one of the few who gave attention to modern languages, and especially
German, from which, jointly with Mr. Tufnell, he translated Müller's "Dorians." In 1828 he
took his University degree as a first-class man in classics, and a second-class in mathematics.
In the same year he entered the Middle Temple, and in 1831 was called to the bar, and joined
the Oxford Circuit. He had studied for the bar with no less diligence than at the University;
but in consequence of weakness of the chest, was obliged, after his first circuit, to abandon
the profession, in which, had health allowed him, his success was certain. In 1835 he was placed
upon the commission of inquiry into the relief of the poor, (on the report of which was founded
the Irish Poor-law,) and the state of the Church in Ireland; and afterward drew up an able
report on the condition of the Irish in Great Britain. In 1836 he was appointed, with Mr. John
Austin, a Commissioner to inquire into the Government of the Island of Malta, especially as
to its tariff and expenditure. The Commission laid an elaborate report before Parliament, in
accordance with the recommendations of which, such reductions were made as rendered the tariff
of Malta one of the least restrictive in the world, and materially extended its trade; and
they succeeded in establishing the freedom of the press in the island.

In January, 1839, Mr. Lewis was appointed a Poor-Law Commissioner, and held the office until
July, 1847; when, determining to enter Parliament, he resigned, and was returned, with Mr.
Joseph Bailey, Jr., and Mr. Francis Wegg Prosser, both Conservatives and Protectionists, without
opposition, for Herefordshire. In November, 1847, he was appointed joint secretary of the Board
of Control, with Mr. James Wilson, M.P. for Westbury, and early in the following year made
his first speech in the House, in opposition to a motion for the production of papers in the
case of the lately deposed Rajah of Sattara. In April, 1848, Mr. Lewis was appointed Under
Secretary of State for the Home Department, and was succeeded in the secretaryship of the Board
of Control by the Hon. John E. Elliot, M.P. for Roxburghshire. In his present office Mr. Lewis
has served on the Smithfield Market Commission, appointed in November, 1849, which has just
brought up its report; and upon that subject, the Irish Poor-Law, and Mr. Disraeli's motion
as to local burdens, has spoken in the House. Last year he brought forward a road bill to consolidate
the management of highways, and dispose of the question of turnpike trusts and their advances.
The bill was not proceeded with last session, and has again been brought forward this year,
with reference, however, only to highways. Mr. Lewis has earned reputation as the translator
of "Boukli's Public Economy of Athens," which, as well as the "Dorians," has become a textbook,
and passed through a second edition; and is known as author of an able essay on the "Use and
Abuse of Political Terms," published in 1832; on the "Origin and Formation of the Romance Languages,"
published in 1835; on "Local Disturbances in Ireland, and the Irish Church Question," in 1836;
on the "Government of Dependencies," in 1841; and "On the Influence of Authority in Matters
of Opinion," in 1849.

ORIGINAL LETTER FROM DR. LAYARD UPON ANCIENT ART, &c.

We present in this number of the International a communication from the most celebrated traveler
of the nineteenth century, AUSTEN HENRY LAYARD, upon the sources of Ancient Art. It was addressed
by the distinguished author to his friend and ours, Mr. MINOR K. KELLOGG, the well-known painter,
who was for some time with DR. LAYARD in the East.

       *       *       *       *       *

MY DEAR FRIEND:

I frequently wish that you were here with me; I could find you subjects which would astonish
you. However, I suppose you are desirous of hearing something about my proceedings. When I
said that the arts may have passed from Egypt into Greece, I merely alluded to the popular
opinion, without adhering to it. It is not altogether improbable that they came from another
source. Phoenicia was too much of a trading province to devote any great attention to the higher
branches of the arts, and I am not aware of any monuments existing which can be traced to that
people, and show a very high knowledge of architecture or sculpture. The designs we have on
their early coins, and particularly if the coins called "the unknown of Celicia," and those
belonging to cities on the southern coast of Asia Minor, were introduced by the Phoenician
colonists, evidently show that Phoenicia had borrowed from the Assyrians and not from the Egyptians.
Indeed, as their language and written character (for the cuneiform, you must remember, appears
only to have been a monumental character, perhaps Semetic, like the hieroglyphics of Egypt),
coincided with those of the Assyrian, it is most probable that their sympathies were with that
people.

I assume that the language of the two nations was the same; this may have been the case at
one period, but whether throughout the existence of the Assyrian empire, may be doubtful. At
any rate, I believe the real Assyrians and the Phoenicians, like all the nations occupying
Syria and Mesopotamia, to have been of the pure Semetic stock. I regret that I have not time
to make you a sketch of a bas-relief. A specimen of this kind would at once show you how much
nearer allied the arts of Greece are with those of Assyria, than with those of Egypt. One thing
appears now to be pretty certain--that all Western Asia, Persia, Susiana, Media, Asia Minor,
&c. were fundamentally indebted to Assyria for their knowledge of the arts. Persepolis is a
mere copy of an Assyrian monument, as far as the sculpture and ornaments are concerned, with
the addition of external architecture, of which, as far as I am yet able to judge, the Assyrians
appear to have been almost entirely ignorant.

There is no reason, therefore, to reject altogether the supposition that the Arts may have
been transmitted from Assyria, through Phoenicia, into Greece, or, indeed, that the Arts may
have passed into that country through Asia Minor. The Assyrians, in the extreme elegance and
taste displayed in their ornaments, in their study of anatomy, and in their evident attempts
at composition, had much in common with the Greeks. I think artists will be surprised when
they see the collection of drawings I have been able to make, and that one of the results of
the discoveries at Nimroud will be new views with regard to the early history of the arts.

When I first came here, all the Arabs around told me that Nimroud was built by Athur, or Assur,
and that it was the ancient capital of Assyria. Great faith may generally be placed in such
traditions in the East. In Mesopotamia, and in the country watered by the Tigris and Euphrates,
it is astonishing how names have been preserved, even when, during Greek, Roman, or other dominion,
other cities were built on the site and named anew. The new names have long been lost, and
the old are this day to be found in the mouth of the Bedouin. I need only mention Tadmor and
Harran. In a religious point of view, there is no doubt that much important information may
be expected from a careful investigation of the monuments of Assyria. During my labors, without
being able to devote much thought or attention to the subject, I have been continually struck
with the curious illustrations of little understood passages in the Bible which these records
afford. In an historical and archæological point of view, I know nothing more interesting and
more promising than the examination of the ruins of Assyria. One of the vastest empires that
ever existed--the power of whose king extended, at one period, over the greater part of Assyria--whose
advance in civilization and knowledge is the theme of ancient historians--disappeared so suddenly
from the face of the earth, that it has left scarcely a trace, save its name, behind. Even
the names of its kings are not satisfactorily known, and out of the various dynastic lists
preserved, we are unable to select one worthy of credit. As to their deeds, we have been in
the most profound darkness, and were it not for the record of their strength and greatness
which we find in the Scriptures, we should scarcely credit the few traditions which the Greeks
have preserved to us. After the lapse of two thousand five hundred years, a mere chance has
thrown their history in our way, and we have now their deeds chronicled in writing and in sculpture.

Were I much given to the explanation of such things by a reference to superhuman interference,
I should be inclined to think that the Almighty had designedly kept these monuments buried
in the Earth, until the time had arrived when man had sufficient leisure and knowledge to discover
the contents of records, written in an unknown character, that He might prove to them how great
was the power which He so suddenly destroyed, and how fully the prophecies upon the subject
were fulfilled. Had these sculptures and inscriptions remained above ground, they would have
utterly disappeared long ere any records could have been made of their former existence. Had
they been casually discovered before the present century, they would most probably have been
used for cement in the construction of the walls of a city. In fact, the moment for their discovery
has, in every way, been most propitious. However, I will not enter into such speculations,
but leave them to those who are that way inclined. A. H. L.

ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE.

WANDERINGS IN THE PENINSULA.

GRENADA, May 18, 1850.

MY DEAR FRIEND--It affords me much pleasure to write you from the midst of the terrestrial
paradise into which my romantic wanderings have at length brought me. Almost every one who
sets out from home with the object of travel, looks forward to some one or two spots, which,
in the light of imagination, glitter like stars in the bright prospective. To me, the two cities
which most aroused my curiosity and pleased my fancy, were first, Grenada, in which I now am,
and Venice, to which I still look forward with a brighter hope, gilded with the rays of memory,
and clustering with the rosebuds of coming days. In Grenada, my expectations, sanguine as they
were, have been more than realized. It is the nearest approach to paradise that I have yet
seen: a spot that cannot disappoint any one, as the best part of its beauty, like that of a
beautiful woman, is of a nature, that not even genius itself can describe. I visit the "Alhambra"
daily, and write a letter within its sacred precincts. Externally the "Alhambra" has a severe
and forbidding appearance, like that of an ancient fortress, but within, it exceeds in beauty
all one's preconceptions, however warm and extravagant they may be. The terrace which conducts
to it, after having passed through the huge gate which opens into its jurisdiction, is embowered
with tall, straight, and overhanging elms, nicely trimmed and of the richest foliage, while
here and there a fountain marks the bends in the road. Along this enchanting walk marble seats
are arranged, where one can repose for a moment to listen to the notes of the nightingales
in the adjacent groves, and charm his fancy with the melodious rippling of water at his feet.
If one has any feeling in his soul, in such a spot as this he is sure to find it. If he has
a woman with him he is certain to fall in love, and if he has not, he may perhaps fall--asleep!

Besides the "Alhambra," there are numerous objects of peculiar interest to be seen in Grenada.
The Cathedral, though inferior to those of Seville and Toledo in magnificence and grandeur,
is nevertheless a splendid edifice, and is rendered particularly interesting as being the last
resting-place of Ferdinand and Isabella, the wisest sovereigns who ever ruled over Spain. Yesterday
we visited the royal chapel, and beheld the beautiful monument erected to their memory. In
its architecture it struck me as being exceedingly unique, the work of consummate skill and
exquisite taste. It is of delicate alabaster, and was wrought, it is said, at Genoa, by Peralla.
It is about twelve feet in length by some ten in breadth, profusely covered with figures and
ingenious designs in relief, while upon it, as upon a bridal couch, the statues of Ferdinand
and Isabella, in their royal robes, are extended side by side--their faces like those of life,
in calm and beautiful repose, elevated toward heaven. Having examined the monument for some
time, we descended into the little arched vault beneath, which contained the coffins of the
deceased monarchs. These were of lead, strongly bound with iron, and the letter F., upon that
of Ferdinand, was the only sign which distinguished them from each other. While in that small
chamber of the dead, my memory ran back to the great events of the fifteenth century--the discovery
of America and the conquest of Grenada--which owed their origin to the enterprise of the two
famous personages whose ashes were inclosed in the heavy leaden cases at my feet; and I never
felt more profoundly the insignificance of earthly renown, or the vanity of individual glory.
"The paths of glory lead but to the grave." Coming from the tomb, we were next shown a sceptre
and crown which had been used by the illustrious dead. Also a sword which Ferdinand himself
wore in his battles with the Moors. Leaving the Cathedral, we proceeded along to the Moorish
palace called "The Generaliffe." This edifice is not far from the "Alhambra," and is separated
from it by a deep and romantic ravine. Passing through a level avenue of cypress and rosebushes,
we arrived at its main entrance. The first view of the interior was ravishing. The virgin stream
of the Daru, here collected in a narrow canal, was rushing with a musical sound through arbors
of cypresses and files of flowery trees, arranged like fairy sentinels on either side. Passing
on, we soon reached the "trysting-place" of Zoraya, the frail Sultana. This spot certainly
is too exquisitely beautiful for me to describe. It is of a rectangular form, and bordered
with beds of flowers and handsome trees. On one side is an arbor of gigantic cypresses, beautifully
trained, the trunks of which were tastefully enamelled with delicate vines, laden with blooming
roses. Within the square is an artificial pond of water, sparkling with golden fishes, in the
centre of which is a fairy-like island, teeming with flowers of numerous kinds. The general
effect of the view was like that of enchantment, or like one of those indescribable scenes
that sometimes visit us in dreams, the beauty of which surpasses reality. But my time will
not allow me to indulge very largely in detail. From the "Generaliffe" we proceeded to several
of the churches, and afterward to an extensive mad-house. We were not a little amused. One
old gentleman, about the "maddest of the lot," who had formerly been a general in the Spanish
army, told me he liked his present quarters very well, but that his companions were nothing
better than a pack of fools! The grounds about this humane establishment are prettily laid
out in gardens and handsome walks, and the patients themselves have a spacious and pleasant
yard for their exercise and recreation. All this reflects favorably upon the character of the
Spanish people, who are ever kind to such as are afflicted or in distress. They never scoff
at human suffering in any form, however fond they may be of the savage ferocity of the bull-fight.
They are compassionate to the poor, and even when the request of a beggar is denied, it is
done in such gentle terms, that the denial is robbed of its sting. "Pardon me for God's sake,
brother," is the usual form. I have found much to admire among the Spaniards. No nation, not
even the French, exceeds them in true politeness or good breeding. When I left Madrid, a friend
of mine procured for me an introductory letter, from a lady whom to this day I have never seen,
addressed to her children living at Grenada. To my great surprise, the ladies called in their
carriage yesterday and inquired for me, although I had not then presented my letter of introduction.
To-day I called upon the family, in company with Mr. Wetmore, (a young American from New York,
who has just reached Grenada from Madrid,) and was most hospitably and kindly received. One
of the young ladies has perhaps the sweetest face I ever saw, and to her beauty her graceful
manners add an indescribable charm. I am quite certain that it would be impossible for me or
any other man to see her many times with impunity. The influence of such attractions with me,
I confess, is quite irresistible. Beauty is more potent than any other agent of human power,
and he who is able to resist it must be a heartless Samson indeed.

                                          Truly yours, JOHN E. WARREN.

"MARKS OF BARHAMVILLE."

We were summoned one evening some three or four months ago to the house of an eminent New Yorker
to hear read the manuscript verses of a gentleman from South Carolina, who was quite sure that
he had earned for himself a name that should endure forever as a part of the national glory.
We had good wine and the choicest company, and these kept us from sleep through numerous scenas
and cantos, and if we formed any judgment in the premises we believe we did not express one.
In due time Messrs. Appleton published the book, and as it has not been noticed much here,
we copy from the June Fraser the following paragraphs about it, premising that our author had
no faith in American criticism, but was quite willing to abide the decisions of English reviewers:

"The general fault of carelessness and clumsiness runs through the volume of poems, apparently,
of a Trans-atlantic author, 'Marks of Barhamville.' The book is just three times as large as
it should have been--as is usually the case nowadays. When will poets learn that 'brevity is
the soul of wit:' and more, that saying a thing in three weak lines is no substitute whatsoever
for the power of saying it in one strong one? Of the first poem in the book, 'Elfreide of Guldal,'
we are unable to speak, having been unable to read it; but it evinces at least more historic
information than is common just now among our poets, who seem to forget utterly that ex nihilo
nihil fit, and that the brains of man may be as surely pumped dry as any other vessel, if nothing
be put in to replace what is taken out. Mr. Marks cannot avoid, too, giving us, like every
one else, a set of clinical lectures on the morbid anatomy of his own inner man, under the
appropriate title of 'Weeds from Life's Sea-shore;' forgetting that sea-weeds must be very
rare and delicate indeed to be worth preserving in a hortus siccus, instead of being usefully
covered out of sight in the nearest earth-heap, there to turn into manure. He is, however,
more objective than most of his self-exenterating compeers; but he wants the grace and cheerful
lightness of the American school. A large part of his volume is taken up with 'Maia, a masque'--an
imitation of Milton's manner, but not, alas! of his melody and polish; as, for instance:--

  "'Not a warbler wakes his lay,
  Not a dewdrop pearls the spray,
  Not a fleecy cloud-rack sails
  'Fore the warm-breath'd summer gales,
  Shedding blessings on the earth,
  But heavenward points its primal birth.

  "Hark! the green-sedg'd chiming rill,
  Weeding down yon cot-crown'd hill,
  The torrent's dash, the river's gush,
  The mighty wind-resounding crush
  Of the fallen monarch of the wood,
  Re-echo'd by the distant flood.

"However, this masque is readable enough, though Flora and Zephyrus, Oberon and Titania, not
much wanted anywhere in the nineteenth century, seem oddly out of place amid 'whippoor-wills,'
and 'mockbirds,' and other Yankee nationalities, pleasing and natural as they are in themselves.
How did they get into the Alleghanies? By liner or steamer? In the main cabin or the steerage?
And were they, were they sea-sick? One would fear it from the unwonted huskiness of their new
utterances.

"The best thing in the book is 'Semaël,' though the plot is neither very apparent nor very
novel, the imagery as trite as need be, the blank verse heavy and monotonous, without breaks,
grouping, or relief, and the accents as often as not on the prepositions:--

                      "'Thé felucca there
  With lateen-sail, seen ín th' horizon-skirt
  Shaping its course t'ward thé Egyptian shore,

  "(Which Egyptian shore?)

  "Gives tó the moon the silv'ry foam, which breaks

  "(Could it give the foam from the moon?)

  "'Gainst thé sharp keel, and tracks the wave with light.
  While just beneath him bounds the lighter skiff
  With bird-like speed; and darting tó the shore,
  Lowers íts white sail,

  "(Not another bark's, mind!)

              and moors its painted prow

  "(Oh, schoolboy's phrase!)

  "Close tó the cliff. Disporting ín the sheen....

"And so forth.

"And yet this whole passage, and what follows, is really imaginative and picturesque, but spoilt
by carelessness, carelessness, carelessness. Either write verses, we say again, or prose. And
unless the metre and accent coincide with the sense, and make music when read merely as prose
is read, the lines are a makeshift and a failure, and neither worth writing or reading, though
they were as fanciful and overloaded as Mr. Browning's, or as grandiloquent and sugary as Mr.
---- Who's?"

Lord Brougham, who next to the Duke of Wellington is now unquestionably the first man of the
British Empire, a few days ago in the House of Lords complained of an instance of libel of
a species which is extremely common in the United States, and which is of all species the most
irritating and offensive. Lord Brougham observed, that no one who had lived so long as he had
in Parliament had ever taken notice so seldom of any libellous matter published, or of any
breach of privilege committed against him. He might also add, that no person had ever been
more the object of the most indiscriminate, and he might say the most absurd and the most unfounded
abuse. Nevertheless, in all such cases he had adopted a neutral course, and had left the truth
to come out in the natural lapse of events. There was, however, one species of breach of privilege
which he had never been disposed to pass unnoticed. Attacks one must undergo. To be exposed
to attacks was the fate of all men who lived in public. No man ought to shrink from or be too
sensitive to attacks; but, under pretence of stating what a lord had said in Parliament, to
put words into his mouth which he had never uttered, for the purpose, the express purpose,
of calumniating him,--words which the writer of the calumny must have well known that he had
never uttered, to put such words into his mouth for such a purpose, formed a case in which
he thought that the party calumniated was bound to bring the party so offending under the notice
of their lordships. Lord Brougham proceeded to arraign the Daily News for an example of this
crime which would have done no dishonor to the inventive faculties of the Literary World.

A MOCK GUILLOTINE.--DELIRIUM TREMENS ON THE STAGE.--It is stated in Galignani's Messenger that
at the end of the late carnival two married women of Vidauban Department of the Var manufactured
a lay figure, entirely in white, and, after attaching a chain round its neck, placed it in
a small cart. Many of the inhabitants then paraded it through the village in solemn procession,
accompanied by a crowd of men carrying axes, &c., and singing revolutionary songs. After a
while they formed a sort of revolutionary tribunal, and the figure, which was called "Blanc,"
was gravely tried, and, by the majority of the votes of the crowd, condemned to death, the
principal judge, a man named Arnaud, saying, "Blanc! you prevent us from dancing farandoles,
and therefore we condemn you to death!" Thereupon, a man seized the figure, placed it on a
plank, and at one blow with his axe severed the head from the body. A bottle of wine had been
placed in the neck of the figure, and, this having been broken by the blow, a resemblance of
blood was produced. The head was then cast into the crowd and torn to pieces by them. This
scandalous scene created a most painful impression throughout the department. A few days afterward,
four men who played a principal part in the affair, and the two women who made the figure,
were brought to trial on the charge of exciting citizens to hatred of each other. The men pleaded
drunkenness as an excuse--the women declared that they had only intended to amuse their children.
Four of the accused were acquitted, and the other two, who had acted as judge and executioner,
were condemned to four and three months' imprisonment. It is a pity that by the application
of some such law, the disgustingly vulgar and brutalizing piece called The Drunkard, which
has lately been played with "immense success" at Barnum's Theatre, (and in which the chief
characters appear in all the stages of degradation until one of them is nearly dead with the

AMERICAN EXTENSION AND CONQUEST.--The Daily News thus opens an article upon the recent attempt
to invade Cuba:

"Shortly after the American war; a sapient French statesman, writing from Louisiana to his
royal master in Paris, advised the French government to cultivate a close and intimate alliance
with the Cherokee Indians, who, occupying as they did the defiles of the Alleghanies, would
form a permanent bulwark between the young Anglo-Saxon republic and the French possessions
on the Mississippi. But the permanent bulwark could no more resist the advancing wave than
a lath and plaster breakwater could withstand the seas of the Channel. In a few short years
not a vestige of it was to be found, and in less than a quarter of a century both French and
Cherokees had disappeared from the scene. Not only were the defiles of the Alleghanies opened,
but the Alleghanies themselves have since been virtually removed. Ever since the foundation
of the republic, our American kinsmen have been anxious to emulate and surpass us in indulging
that desire for territorial acquisition, which seems to be, for the present at least, the ruling
passion of the Anglo-Saxon mind. Confined at first between the Alleghanies and the Atlantic,
they gradually spread westward to the Mississippi, of both banks of which, from its sources
to its embouchure, they possessed themselves as early as 1806. Their coast line, which, originally,
did not extend beyond the St. Mary, was soon afterward carried round the peninsula of Florida,
and along the northern shore of the Mexican Gulf, westward to the mouth of the Sabine. Not
satisfied with this, they planted themselves in Texas, and some years afterward transferred
their boundary to the Rio Grande. Oregon, New Mexico, and California, fell in quick succession
within the grasp of the confederacy. The entire disappearance of the Spaniard from the continent
is a consummation, not even doubtful, but simply awaiting the convenience of the encroaching
Anglo-Saxon. For the accession of Canada, time is implicitly relied upon--the idea of conquest
in that quarter being out of the question--and thus it is that even sober-minded men are beginning
to believe that the time is not far off when the glowing prophecies of the most sanguine will
be realized, that the boundaries of the republic would yet be the Isthmus, the North Pole,
and the two oceans."

LEDRU ROLLIN'S new work, "The Decline of England," of which the first volume only has appeared,
is, as might have been anticipated, savagely attacked in most of the British journals. The
Times observes:

"M. Ledru Rollin professes to be a philosopher and a statesman, and, being induced by somewhat
peculiar circumstances to reflect upon the condition of this country, he was, he tells us,
driven to the conclusion that we are a declining people, destined in no short period to exhibit
to mankind a fearful spectacle of misery and ruin. Some persons have thought, that the many
manifestations of material wealth and power which must have presented themselves to the eyes
and mind of M. Ledru Rollin, even on the most casual observation, should have induced him in
his character of philosoper to hesitate in deciding so hastily, and with such emphasis, that
our destruction is imminent. But in our opinion there are events of everyday occurrence connected
with our social habits and customs--events which from their frequency cease to excite our attention--which
should be deemed still more important and significant, and which to one really deserving the
name of a philosopher would appear more powerful guarantees for the future happiness of a people
among whom they occur than any afforded by mere proofs of great wealth, power, or skill. It
is much the fashion with those who delight to deal in doleful vaticinations as to the future
destiny of England, to dwell with great emphasis upon the amazing diversity of conditions to
be seen here--to exaggerate the suffering of the millions of our poor, and to place them in
a sort of rhetorical contrast with the extravagant wealth of a favored few. But there is still
something in the mutual relations of all classes of society in this country that proves a healthy
condition to exist in our body politic, that shows that we are really brethren, and that whether
interest or kind sympathies govern us we are still one people--with great differences of opinion
among us indeed, openly expressed by all, but still with a feeling prevalent in all classes
of the community that we form one people, and that we are, from the most powerful to the most
weak, bound together by ties of great regard as well as national brotherhood."

THE LATE CATASTROPHE ON LAKE ERIE.--Our whole country has been once more shocked by an appalling
and unnecessary loss of life, from the burning of the steamer Griffith. We use the expression,
unnecessary loss of life, not from any hasty impulse, or undue excitement, but in view of the
evident and undeniable fact, that two hundred and fifty human beings have been sacrificed for
a culpable neglect on the part of the proprietors of the steamer to furnish suitable protection.
No one competent to judge will doubt that every individual on the Griffith might have been
saved had she been provided with life-boats. The avarice of proprietors has generally prevented
their use, though the cost of a sufficient number for each steamer would not exceed one thousand
dollars. The lives of hundreds of men, women and children are of little account to a corporation,
when weighed against a thousand dollars of their capital stock. Life-boats cannot save their
burning property, and why impair their own interests for the saving a few hundred lives now
and then? We have the approbation of every disinterested citizen, when we suggest to Congress
some law which shall compel steamboat owners to protect their passengers in case of accident,
by suitable life-saving apparatus. Fire-proof paints and other incombustible materials are
very wisely demanded, but our navigation is exposed to a thousand other dangers, which can
be guarded against by no other means so effectually as by life-boats; and it should be within
the duties of the inspectors to see that steamers are in all instances furnished with a sufficient
number of them to contain their full complement of passengers.

RECENT DEATHS.

JANE PORTER.--As in the case of the recent death of Miss Edgeworth, it is singular that so
little notice has been taken of the demise of Jane Porter, one of the most distinguished novelists
which England has produced. Miss Porter may be said to have been the first who introduced that
beautiful kind of fiction, the historical romance, which has added such amusement and interest
to English literature. The author of "Thaddeus of Warsaw" and "The Scottish Chiefs" has done
much to deserve the lasting respect and gratitude of her country.

The family of this excellent woman and able writer, according to the Illustrated News, is of
Irish descent. Her father was an officer of dragoons in the British service; he married a Miss
Blenkinsopp, of the Northumbrian house of Blenkinsopp, which Camden styles "a right ancient
and generous family." Miss Porter's father died in the prime of life, and left his widow with
five almost infant children, in slender circumstances. The great talents of this orphan family
raised them to affluence and distinction. Three of the children were sons; of these, the eldest
perished in a dangerous climate abroad, at the commencement of a promising career; the second
(the present Dr. William Ogilvie Porter, of Bristol) became a physician, and practiced successfully.
The third was the late Sir Robert Ker Porter, K.C.H., distinguished as an author, a painter,
and a soldier: some of our finest battle-pieces are the work of his pencil, and he himself
followed heroes to the field; he was with Sir John Moore when he fell victoriously at Corunna,
and he earned a high reputation throughout the Peninsular war. He afterward became a diplomatist,
and was latterly consul at Venezuela. His "Traveling Sketches in Russia and Egypt" procured
him also an author's fame. Sir Robert Ken Porter died suddenly about seven years ago; he left
by his wife, a Russian lady, an only daughter, who is married, and resides in Russia. The two
sisters of these brothers Porter were even more distinguished. The younger of them, Miss Anna
Maria Porter, became an authoress at twelve years of age; she wrote many successful novels,
of which the most popular were the "Hungarian Brothers," the "Recluse of Norway," and the "Village
of Mariendorpt." She died at her brother's residence at Bristol, on the 6th of June, 1832.
The elder sister, Miss Jane Porter, the subject of this notice, was born at Durham, where her
father's regiment was quartered at the time. She, with her sister, Anna Maria, received her
education under a famous Scotch tutor, Mr. Fulton, at Edinburgh, where her widowed mother lived
with her children in their early years. The family afterward removed, first to Ditton, and
thence to Esher, in Surrey, where Mrs. Porter, a most intelligent and agreeable lady, resided
with her daughters for many years, until her death, in 1831. Mrs. Porter was buried in the
churchyard at Esher; and on her tomb the passer-by may read this inscription, "Here lies Jane
Porter, a Christian widow." As a novelist Miss Jane Porter obtained the highest celebrity.
Her three most renowned productions were her "Thaddeus of Warsaw," written when she was about
twenty years of age, her "Scottish Chiefs," and her "Pastor's Fireside." "Thaddeus of Warsaw"
had immense popularity; it was translated into most of the Continental languages, and Poland
was loud in its praise. Kosciusko sent the author a ring containing his portrait. General Gardiner,
the British Minister at Warsaw, could not believe that any other than an eye-witness had written
the story, so accurate were the descriptions, although Miss Porter had not then been in Poland.
The "Scottish Chiefs" was equally successful. With regard to this romance, it is known that
Sir Walter Scott admitted to George IV., one day, in the library at Carlton Palace, that the
"Scottish Chiefs" was the parent in his mind of the Waverley Novels. In a letter written to
her friend Mr. Litchfield, about three months ago, Miss Porter, speaking of these novels, said:--"I
own I feel myself a kind of sybil in these things; it being full fifty years ago since my 'Scottish
Chiefs' and 'Thaddeus of Warsaw' came into the then untrodden field. And what a splendid race
of the like chroniclers of generous deeds have followed, brightening the track as they have
advanced! The author of 'Waverley,' and all his soul-stirring 'Tales of my Landlord,' &c. Then
comes Mr. James, with his historical romances, on British and French subjects, so admirably
uniting the exquisite fiction with the fact, that the whole seems equally verity. But my feeble
hand" (Miss Porter was ailing when she wrote the letter) "will not obey my wish to add more
to this host of worthies. I can only find power to say with my trembling pen that I cannot
but esteem them as a respected link with my past days of lively interest in all that might
promote the virtue and true honor of my contemporaries from youth to age." These eloquent words
become the more touching, when we consider that within three months after they were written,
this admirable lady quitted this life in the honored maturity of her fame.

Miss Porter wrote, in conjunction with her sister, "Tales round a Winter's Hearth." She was
also an indefatigable contributor to the periodicals of the day. Her biographical sketch of
Colonel Denham, the African traveler, in the Naval and Military Journal, was much admired as
one of the most affecting tributes ever paid to departed merit. Miss Porter was a Chanoiness
of the Polish order of St. Joachim, which honor was conferred upon her after the publication
of "Thaddeus of Warsaw." She is, in her portraits, generally represented in the habit of this
order. Miss Porter died on the 24th ult., at the residence of her brother, Dr. Porter, in Portland-square,
Bristol. That brother, so tenderly beloved by her, and so justly respected by all who know
him, is now the last survivor of this brilliant company of brothers and sisters; and he, too,
we are sorry to say, is in an enfeebled state from paralysis, aggravated by the recent shock
of his gifted relative's demise. Except himself and his married niece in Russia, there remains
no representative of a family which England has good cause to hold in grateful remembrance.

THE COUNT DE VITTRÉ.--The Paris journals announce the death of one of the most distinguished
officers of the French army, General Count de Vittré, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor,
&c. Charles de Raity de Villeneuve, Count de Vittré, was descended from an old and noble family
of Poitou, was the comrade of Napoleon at the Military School, and took a glorious part in
the campaign of Russia, where he was severely wounded. He also distinguished himself in the
Spanish expedition in 1823, where he had under his orders General Changarnier, the Duke de
Crillon, and M.A. Carrel, who, on account of his valor, gave him the surname of the Bayard
of the 19th Century. General Count de Vittré was uncle to M. Hugues de Coval, a distinguished
political writer of Paris.

MATTHEW L. DAVIS died on the 15th June, at the age of 84. He had been for two or three years
enfeebled, and for the last year confined to his room, but he retained his mental faculties
and his physical powers until after his eightieth year, owing, in great measure, to the temperance
of his habits, his fondness for exercise, and his elastic, hopeful temperament. Mr. Davis was
preëminently a politician through life, and aided to organize and give triumph to "the Republican
party," so called, more than half a century ago, when the Federal or Washingtonian party was
prostrated not more by its own follies than by the ability and tact of its leading adversaries.
Half the good management and efficient activity that served to elect Jefferson would have sufficed
to defeat him. And nowhere was the battle of Democracy fought with greater address or against
more formidable odds than in this State and City, under the consummate generalship of Aaron
Burr, of whom Davis was the untiring lieutenant and confidential friend.

Though so long and so deeply immersed in Politics, possessing decided talents and a thorough
knowledge of public affairs, Mr. Davis never held any prominent office. He did not seem to
be an ambitious man. He was once wealthy, and became poor, but he never seemed elated by prosperity
nor humbled by adversity. He was not a fortunate politician, and he seemed to love the smoke
of the battle more than the plunder of the field. He was quite often on the unlucky side--for
Crawford in '24--for Adams in '28--for Clay in '32,--and so on. His side was taken from impulse
and personal liking, not from selfish calculation. He had known almost every man who figures
in the history of our country since the Revolutionary era, and, while his faculties remained,
his conversation was remarkably instructive and entertaining. In early life Mr. Davis was engaged
in trade, and was moderately successful, but he gave up business to devote himself more entirely
to politics, He reëntered commercial life before the last war with England, and his house (Davis
& Strong) was fortunate in South American speculations, of the profits of which he himself
received some $50,000, which, however, was soon lost. For half a century he was an industrious
writer. He produced several very clever pamphlets upon men and affairs, and was for many years
known as "The Spy in Washington" for the Courier and Enquirer, and "The Genevese Traveler"
for the London Times. Burr bequeathed to him all his papers, and from these and his memoranda
and recollections he prepared and published, in 1838, "Memoirs of Aaron Burr, with Miscellaneous
Selections from his Correspondence," in 2 vols. 8vo., and "The Private Journal of Aaron Burr
during his Residence of Four Years in Europe, with Selections from his Correspondence," 2 vols.
8vo.

REV. JOSEPH SAMUEL C. F. FREY, a well-known Baptist clergyman, died at Pontiac, Michigan, in
the 79th year of his age, on the 5th of June. He was born of Jewish parents, in Germany, and
was for several years reader in a Synagogue. When about twenty-five years old, he became a
Christian, and soon after a student of divinity at Berlin. He was subsequently engaged nearly
all the time in efforts to convert the Jews. It was at his suggestion that the London Missionary
Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews, was founded, in 1808. In 1816 he came to
the United States, and was for a time pastor of a Presbyterian Church in this city, but changing
his views upon the subject of baptism, he joined the Baptist Church, and was settled over congregations
at Newark and at Sing Sing, until, through his means, the Society for Meliorating the Condition
of the Jews was founded, and he became its missionary. He wrote several books, which display
considerable learning and an amiable and honorable temper. The most popular of his productions
is one entitled "Joseph and Benjamin," designed to illustrate the points of difference between
the Jews and Christians.

SCIENTIFIC MISCELLANIES.

MR. PAINE'S HYDRO-ELECTRIC LIGHT.--All the past eras that are marked by especial characteristics
and glories must yield before our own, the AGE OF DISCOVERY, which bequeaths to the new generations
so many applications of steam and electricity, so many inventions in all the arts, and such
vast enterprises undertaken and accomplished for the good of mankind. These, as the Tribune
eloquently says, are the immortal monuments of our times, and dwarf earlier performances into
a very inferior position. What are the pyramids to a line of steamships? What is there in Homer
or Plato worthy to be mentioned on the day when Professor Morse sets up his telegraph, and
mightier than Jupiter, the cloud-compeller, with the lightnings of Heaven flashes intelligence
from Halifax to New Orleans, as rapidly as the behests of the mind reach the fingers? How petty
and narrow seem the ambition and desires of Alexander or Napoleon when the bold and prophetic
genius of Whitney, dealing with continents and nations as with parishes and neighborhoods,
stretches his iron road around half the globe and shows you, moving forward and backward over
its rails, the flux and reflux of a world's commerce and intercourse, a sublime tide of benefits
and universal relations! What poet, what artist, what philosopher, what statesman, has equalled
in grandeur these conceptions of science, or the splendid results which have followed their
practical realization? Not one. And the reason of this is plain. These things are filled with
the spirit of future centuries, while our Art, Literature, Statesmanship, Philosophy, are either
mere dead relics of the past, or the poor makeshifts of a present, not yet equal to the business
Providence has given it to perform.

It is claimed for Mr. Paine that he has found out the means of producing the greatest revolution
which physical science can well be supposed to make in the business and comfort of society.
As far as we apprehend his claim, it is that he has established as a new principle of science
that electricity possesses the qualities of weight, compressibility and gravitation; that he
has proved water to be in reality a simple elemental substance, which he can decompose or transform
into either hydrogen or oxygen gas according to its electrical condition, and according as
positive or negative electricity is applied to it; and that he has invented the means whereby
from water he can produce at will either of these gases without any other than mechanical agency
and with no expense save that of the machine, which will cost at the outset $400 or $500, and
last for an indefinite period. If this is true, it is unquestionably the greatest discovery
of modern times, and will produce a change in affairs of all sorts so profound and extensive
as to surpass and bewilder the mind which seeks to imagine it. When with a pail of water you
can without expense light and heat your house; when coal mines are useless, and steamships
draw their fuel from the waves they traverse; then the comforts and luxuries of life, and the
means of traveling will be diminished in price so as to come within the ability of every man;
a great deal of the most toilsome and disagreeable work now performed will become unnecessary;
and a vast step will be made toward a more just and equal distribution of social advantages.
Mr. Paine is now engaged at the Astor House in preparations to light that immense hotel with
his hydro-electric gas, and the result of his experiment is looked for with profound interest.
We confess little faith in his success.

The story of an American inventor named REMINGTON--who a year or two since addressed to the
late Mr. Senator Lewis, of Alabama, a history of his adventures, which was published in the
Merchant's Magazine--must be well-remembered, for its intrinsic interest, and on account of
the denials and refutations of portions of it by certain persons in London to whom allusion
was made in Mr. Remington's letter. The invention, the Remington Bridge, seems now to be exciting
no little attention both in England and in this country. The principle which gives to it its
great strength, is the peculiar construction of its longitudinal supporters, investing them
with all the tenacity that wood has when it is sought to be drawn apart. Thus it is capable
of sustaining as great weight as would be required to pull asunder the fibres of the longitudinal
supporters. No wooden bridge can be built of so great a span. Mr. Remington believes that he
can build a span at least 1320 feet in length, while the span of the old wooden bridge at Fairmount,
near Philadelphia, which was one of the largest in the world, was but little over 300 feet.
The annals of mechanical art afford few instances where a great invention has been developed
and prosecuted under apparently more adverse circumstances.

AUTHORS AND BOOKS.

The Rev. THOMAS H. SMYTH, D.D. of South Carolina, whose work upon the Unity of the Human Races,
suggested by the recent declarations of infidelity, by Professor Agassiz of Harvard College
and others, has been published by Putnam, and received with a hearty applause by Christians
and scholars, is not, as is commonly supposed, an American author, though he has long resided
in this country. He was born in Belfast, in the North of Ireland, and educated at the Royal
College in that city, pursuing afterward his theological studies in London, and at Princeton
in New Jersey. He has been eighteen years minister of the Presbyterian church in Charleston,
where he was married, and where he will probably always reside, while in this country; but
his liberal fortune and inquiring spirit tempt him to frequent travel, and he is now absent
upon a tour which will probably be extended to Nineveh and all the most interesting scenes
connected with the history of religion in the eastern world. Dr. Smyth possesses one of the
largest and most valuable private libraries in the United States, and has therefore been able
to compose his learned works in theology, history, &c. under advantages but seldom enjoyed
by our authors. Dr. Smyth has also written largely in the Biblical Repertory, the Southern
Presbyterian Review, and other Periodicals.

MR. MAYNE REID, who in sundry letters published in this city last year, claimed that he was
the real hero of the Mexican war--in which he served as a lieutenant of the New York volunteers--has
recently published in London a brace of volumes under the title of The Rifle Rangers. In his
preface he alleges that all his statements offered as facts are strictly true, though at times
highly colored for the sake of effect. This will be obvious to every reader, for the book is
full of adventures of all sorts--perils by sword, fire, rivals, wild animals, bloodhounds,
&c.--which are related in a lively, dashing style, varied at times with descriptions of the
scenery, plants, and inhabitants of Central America. One of the London journals, in a review
of it, observes, "We would not wish a more lively or interesting companion than Captain Reid,--a
thorough Yankee soldier, combining humor, imagination, and dashing bravery in the highest degree."
The thorough Yankee, like many others much quoted abroad, is a clever Irish adventurer, who
was in the United States altogether some four or five years, engaged chiefly as a writer for
the journals in New York and Philadelphia.

M. EUGENE SCRIBE, the writer of the libretto of Tempesta, just brought out in London, at the
age of eighteen years, was placed under the care of M. Dupin, now the President of the French
Legislative Assembly, to study the Roman law. Shortly after reaching his majority he began
his dramatic career by writing a vaudeville for the Gymnase. His success here led to an engagement
to write for the Theatre Francais, and to the establishment of his reputation as a dramatic
author. He has composed ten comedies in five acts, and twenty in one, two, or three acts, for
the Francais. He has written one hundred and fifty vaudevilles for the Gymnase. As a lyrical
poet he stands unequalled for the number of his libretti, having written the poetry of forty
grand operas and of one hundred comic operas. His works, exclusive of novels, are three hundred
and forty in number.

THE HISTORY OF GREECE

BY GEORGE GROTE.

Mr. Grote's history has yet arrived only at the close of the fourth century B.C., and the fall
of the Thirty Tyrants. Two of the six compartments in which he proposes, to use his own quaint
phrase, "to exhaust the free life of collective Hellas," still remain to be accomplished. But
the history of Greece is written. Stirring events and great names are still to come; the romantic
enterprise of Cyrus and the retreat of the Ten Thousand, the elective trust of Thebes, and
the chivalrous glories of her one great man. Demosthenes has yet to prove how vain is the divinest
eloquence when poured to degenerate hearts. Agis and Cleomenes have yet to exhibit the spectacle,
ever fraught with melancholy interest, of noble natures out of harmony with the present, and
spending their energies in the vain attempt to turn back the stream of time and call again
into existence the feelings and the institutions of an irrevocable past. The monarchy of Philip
is yet due to fate. Macedon is still to Greece what Russia, before Peter the Great, was to
Europe--a half-unknown and barbarous land, full of latent energy and power, and waiting for
the rise of a master mind to discern its embryo greatness and turn its peasants into the unconquerable
phalanx. Alexander must arise to carry forth with his victorious arms the seeds of Greek civilization
over the Eastern world. Aristotle must arise to gather up in one boundless mind the vast results
of Greek philosophy, and found an empire vaster and more enduring than that of his great pupil
in the subjugated intellect of man. But the history of Greece is finished. Athens and Sparta,
the two great antagonistic types of Greek society, politics, and education, have attained their
full development, passed their allotted hour of trial, and touched upon their doom. The shades
of night are gathering on the bright day of Hellas. The momentous work of that wonderful people
is accomplished; the interest of the great intellectual and moral contest has centred in one
man; the last scene of the Phædo has been enacted, and Socrates has died.

The history of Greece is written, and the character of the historian is decided. Mr. Grote
has achieved a noble work--a work which, unless the glory of classical literature is a dream,
will well repay, in usefulness and in renown, the devotion of a scholars life. His book will
be called great while Grecian story retains its interest. Even making allowance for the wonderful
labors of the Germans and the extraordinary addition which their learned toils have made to
our knowledge of the subject, we should say that the work before us has almost disentombed
many portions of Greek life. We cannot sufficiently extol the wonderful knowledge of all the
feelings, habits, associations, and institutions of an extinct people which every page exhibits,
and the familiar mastery with which a mind steeped in Grecian lore analyzes, combines, criticizes,
and unfolds the mass of heterogeneous and often conjectural materials on which it has to work.
Not only have we been enabled to read Greek history with new eyes and a new understanding,
but light has been poured upon its literature; and, to apply to Mr. Grote the compliment he
pays to others, "the poets, historians, orators, and philosophers of Greece have been all rendered
both more intelligible and more instructive to the student, and the general picture of the
Grecian world may now be conceived with a degree of fidelity which, considering our imperfect
materials, it is curious to contemplate." Two volumes more at least must be yet to come, but
Mr. Grote's pedestal is sure; and nothing can diminish the satisfaction he must now feel at
his decided and proclaimed success but the consciousness that the moment is approaching when
he must part with the companion of many a sweet though toilsome hour, and experience the mingled
feelings which Gibbon has so well portrayed in writing "the last page of the last chapter"
of the history of Greece.

It is pity that such high intrinsic merits should be marred, both as regards the pleasure and
the instruction of the reader, by a fatal deficiency of style. It is pity, but it is true.
Mr. Grote seems to have lived in the works of the Greek writers till he has almost forgotten
the forms and cadence of his mother tongue. It is not only that he so frequently has resort
to an uncouth Greek compound when he might easily express the same idea in two or three English
words, if not one; there is a perpetual clumsiness in his construction of common sentences
and his use of common words. Clarendon himself is not harder or more tortuous. Even in purely
narrative parts, which ought to flow most easily, the understanding of the reader can seldom
keep pace with his eye. Cyclopean epithets are piled together almost at random on any substantive
which will have the complaisance to receive them. The choice of expression and metaphor is
sometimes such as almost to rival the achievements of Castlereagh in his happiest hour. We
have people existing, "not as individual names on paper, but simply as an imposturous nominal
aggregate,"--Thucydides "reserving his flowers to strew on the grave of Nicias,"--the Athenians
"sailing out" to action, having "left their sails at Teichiassa," and their "sailing back"
to Teichiassa for their sails,--Athens, "the mistress and successor of the Ionian Confederacy,"--inestimable
stepping-stones toward a goal, and oligarchical conspirators against popular liberty "tying
down the patient while the process of emasculation was being consummated." We are sorry to
say that these instances are taken from the last two volumes, so that Mr. Grote does not improve
as he advances. In the first volume, when relating the legends of early Greece, we are glad
he does not imitate the forced simplicity with which Dr. Arnold tells the legends of early
Rome; but it is too flat to describe Atalanta as "beautiful and matchless for swiftness of
foot, but living in the forest as a huntress, and unacceptable to Aphrodite." The redeeming
point, and a great redeeming point it is, is the total absence of anything like affectation.
All the peculiarities are genuine, and everything that is genuine in composition, though it
cannot be admired, may be borne. But for this we should be compelled to class one of the best
of English books among the very worst of English writings. Mr. Grote must remember that no
man who writes for posterity can afford to neglect the art of composition. The trimmer bark,
though less richly laden, will float further down the stream of time, and when so many authors
of real ability and learning are competing for every niche in the temple of fame, the coveted
place will certainly be won by style.

It is this deficiency of art which can alone prevent Mr. Grote's history from completely superseding
both the works already existing of the same magnitude. Neither the spirit of Mitford nor the
solid sense of Thirlwall could long preserve them from eclipse. The light of the former indeed
has long grown dim. He is always blundering, and his blunders are always on the Tory side.
Arnold's good word has kept him a few years longer on our bookshelves. Dr. Thirlwall has higher
qualities, but, not to mention that he has damaged himself by writing against Mitford instead
of ignoring him, he is terribly dry, and Mr. Grote leaves him far behind in appreciation of
all that belongs to Greece, in loving industry, in warmth of sympathy, and, well read scholars
as they both are, in deep knowledge of his subject. The cheaper and more compendious histories
of course are not affected. The light and credulous Goldsmith is still left to contend with
the more correct but duller Keightley for the patronage of ingenuous youth. Perhaps both yield
to the meritorious little work published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.
But a place, and an honorable place, is still left for any one who can tell the story of Greece
in a succinct and lively form, availing himself of the light which Mr. Grote has shed upon
the subject, cultivating candor and right sympathies, cutting short the ante-historical period,
bringing strongly out the great states and the great men, limiting himself to two moderate
volumes, and addressing himself especially to the unlearned and the young.

NINEVEH

By Edwin Atherstone.

  Of NINEVEH, the mighty city of old;
  The queen of all the nations. At her throne
  Kings worshipp'd; and from her their subject crowns,
  Humbly obedient, held; and on her state
  Submiss attended; nor such servitude
  Opprobrious named. From that great eminence
  How, like a star, she fell, and passed away;
  Such the high matter of my song shall be

  The vision comes upon me! To my soul
  The days of old return: I breathe the air
  Of the young world: I see her giant sons.
  A sound of stately treading toward me comes;
  A silken wafting on the cedar floor:
  As from Arabia's flowering groves, an air
  Delicious breathes around. Tall, lofty browed,
  Pale, and majestically beautiful;
  In vesture gorgeous as the clouds of morn;
  With slow proud step her glorious dames sweep by

  And I look; and lo! before the walls,
  Unnumbered hosts in flaming panoply;
  Chariots like fire, and thunder-bearing steeds!
  I hear the shouts of battle: like the waves
  Of a tumultuous sea they roll and dash!
  In flame and smoke the imperial city sinks!
  Her walls are gone: her palaces are dust:
  The desert is around her, and within:
  Like shadows have the mighty passed away!

  Whence and how came the ruin? By the hand
  Of the oppressor were the nations bowed;
  They rose against him, and prevailed: for he
  The haughty monarch who the earth could rule,
  By his own furious passions was o'er-ruled:
  With pride his understanding was made dark,
  That he the truth knew not; and, by his lusts;
  The crushing burthen of his despotism;
  And by the fierceness of his wrath, the hearts
  Of men he turned from him. So to kings
  Be he example, that the tyrannous
  And iron rod breaks down at length the hand
  That wields it strongest: that by virtue alone
  And justice monarchs sway the hearts of men:
  For there hath God implanted love of these,
  And hatred of oppression; which, unseen
  And noiseless though it work; yet in the end,
  Even like the viewless elements of the storm,
  Brooding in silence, will in thunder burst!
  So let the nations learn, that not in wealth;
  Nor in the grosser pleasures of the sense;
  Nor in the glare of conquest; nor the pomp
  Of vassal kings, and tributary lands;
  Do happiness and lasting power abide:
  That virtue unto man best glory is;
  His strength and truest wisdom; and that vice,
  Though for a season it the heart delight;
  Or to worse deeds the bad man do make strong;
  Brings misery yet, and terror, and remorse,
  And weakness and destruction in the end.
  So if the nations learn, then not in vain,
  The mighty one hath been; and is no more!

IF I WERE A VOICE.

  If I were a voice, a persuasive voice,
  That could travel the wide world through.
  I would fly on the beams of the morning light,
  And speak to men with a gentle might,
  And tell them to be true.
  I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er land and sea,
  Wherever a human heart might be,
  Telling a tale, or singing a song,
  In praise of the right--in blame of the wrong.

  If I were a voice, a consoling voice,
  I'd fly on the wings of air.
  The homes of sorrow and guilt I'd seek,
  And calm and truthful words I'd speak
  To save them from despair.
  I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er the crowded town,
  And drop, like the happy sunlight, down
  Into the hearts of suffering men,
  And teach them to rejoice again.

  If I were a voice, a convincing voice,
  I'd travel with the wind,
  And whenever I saw the nations torn
  By warfare, jealousy, or scorn,
  Or hatred of their kind,
  I'd fly, I'd fly, on the thunder crash,
  And into their blinded bosoms flash;
  And, all their evil thoughts subdued,
  I'd teach them Christian brotherhood.

  If I were a voice, a pervading voice,
  I'd seek the kings of earth;
  I'd find them alone on their beds at night,
  And whisper words that should guide them right--
  Lessons of priceless worth;
  I'd fly more swift than the swiftest bird,
  And tell them things they never heard--
  Truths which the ages for aye repeat--
  Unknown to the statesmen at their feet.

  If I were a voice, an immortal voice,
  I'd speak in the people's ear;
  And whenever they shouted "Liberty,"
  Without deserving to be free,
  I'd make their error clear.
  I'd fly, I'd fly, on the wings of day,
  Rebuking wrong on my world-wide way,
  And making all the world rejoice--
  If I were a voice--an immortal voice.--C. Mackay.

THE GREEN HAND.

BY THE AUTHOR OF "TOM CRINGLE'S LOG."

PART I.

"Come, old ship, give us a yarn!" said the younger forecastle-men to an old one, on board of
an Indiaman then swiftly cleaving the waves of the western Atlantic before the trade-wind,
and outward-bound, with a hearty crew and a number of passengers. It was the second of the
two dog-watches, and the ship being still in the region of evening twilights, her men in a
good humor, and with leisure, were then usually disposed, as on this occasion, to make fast
their roaming thoughts by help of a good yarn, when it could be got. There were plenty of individuals,
amongst a crew of forty, calculated by their experience, or else by their flow of spirits,
and fancy, to spin it. Each watch into which they were divided had its especial story-teller,
with whose merits it twitted the other, and on opportunity of a general reunion, they were
pitted against one another like two fighting-cocks, or a couple of rival novelists in more
polished literary society at home. The one was a grave, solemn old North-Sea whaler with one
eye, who professed to look down with contempt upon all raw head-work, on navigation compared
with seamanship, and fiction against fact. As for himself, he rested all his fame upon actual
experience, and told long dry narratives of old shipmates, of his voyages and adventures, and
sometimes of the most incredible incidents, with a genuine briny gusto which pleased the veteran
stagers beyond expression. They were full of points of seamanship--expedients for nice emergencies,
tacks, knots, and splices. He gave the very conversation of his characters, with all the "says
he" and "says I;" and one long recital of the old fellow's turned upon the question between
himself and a newfangled second mate about the right way to set up back-stays, in which he,
the sailor, was proved correct by the loss of the ship.

The other story-teller, again, was a Wapping man; a lively, impudent young Cockney, who had
the most miraculous faculty of telling lies--not only palpable lies, but lies absolutely impossible:
yet they were so sublimely told often, and he contrived to lug into them such a quantity of
gorgeous tinsel ornament, as, in his happier efforts, decidedly to carry the day against his
opponent. The London hand had seen life too, of which, with respect to what is called the world,
his competitor was as ignorant as a child. He had his sentimental vein, accordingly, in which
he took the last love-tale out of some "Penny Story-Teller" or fashionable novel he had spelled
over below, and turned it over into a parody that would have thrown its unfortunate author
into convulsions of horror, and his critics into shrieks of laughter. The fine language of
lords and ladies, of romantic heroines, or of foreign counts and bandits, was gravely retailed
and gravely listened to by a throng of admiring jacktars; while the old whaler smoked his pipe
sulkily apart, gave now and then a scornful glance out of his weather-eye, and called it "all
'high-dic' and soger's gammon."

On this occasion, however, the group forward did not solicit the services of either candidate,
as they happened to have present among them a shipmate, who, by general confession, "took the
shine" out of both, although it was rarely they could get hold of him. "Old Jack," the captain's
private steward, was the oldest seaman on board, and having known the captain when the latter
went to sea, had sailed with him almost ever since he commanded a ship, as well as lived in
his house on shore. He did not now keep his watch, nor take his "trick at the helm," except
when he chose, and was altogether a privileged sort of a person, or one of the "idlers." His
name was Jacobs, which afforded a pretext for calling him "Old Jack," with the sailor's fondness
for that Christian cognomen, which it is difficult to account for, unless because Jonah and
St. John were seafaring characters, and the Roman Catholic holy clerk St. Nicholas was baptized
"Davy Jones," with sundry other reasons good at sea. But Old Jack was, at any rate, the best
hand for a yarn in the Gloucester Indiaman, and had been once or twice called upon to spin
one to the ladies and gentlemen in the cuddy. It was partly because of his inexhaustible fund
of good humor, and partly from that love of the sea which looked out through all that the old
tar had seen and undergone, and which made him still follow the bowsprit, although able to
live comfortably ashore. In his blue jacket, white canvas trowsers edged with blue, and glazed
hat, coming forward to the galley to light his pipe, after serving the captain's tea of an
evening, Old Jack looked out over the bulwarks, sniffed the sharp sea-air, and stood with his
shirt-sleeve fluttering as he put his finger in his pipe, the very embodiment of the scene--the
model of a prime old salt who had ceased to "rough it," but could do so yet if needful.

"Come, old ship!" said the men near the windlass, as soon as Old Jack came forward, "give us
a yarn, will ye?"

"Yarn!" said Jack, smiling, "what yarn, mates? 'Tis a fine night, though, for that same--the
clouds fly high, and she's balling off a good ten knots sin' eight bells."

"That she is, bo'--so give us a yarn now, like a reg'lar old A 1 as you are!" said one.

"'Vast there, mate," said a man-o'-wars-man, winking to the rest,--"you're always a-cargo-puddling,
Bill! D'ye think Old Jack answers to any other hail nor the Queen's? I say, old three-decker
in or'nary, we all wants one o' your close-laid yarns this good night. Whaling Jim here rubs
his down with a thought over much o' the tar, an' young Joe dips 'em in yallow varnish--so
if you says Nay, why, we'll all save our grog, and get drunk as soon as may be."

"Well, well, mates," said Jack, endeavoring to conceal his flattered, feelings, "what is it
to be, though?"

"Let's see," said the man-o'-war's-man--"aye, give us the Green Hand!"

"Aye, aye, the Green Hand!" exclaimed one and all. This "Green Hand" was a story Old Jack had
already related several times, but always with such amusing variations, that it seemed on each
repetition a new one--the listeners testifying their satisfaction by growls of rough laughter,
and by the emphatic way in which, during a pause, they squirted their tobacco-juice on the
deck. What gave additional zest to this particular yarn, too, was the fact of its hero being
no less than the captain himself, who was at this moment on the poop quarter-deck of the ship,
pointing out something to a group of ladies by the round-house--a tall, handsome-looking man
of about forty, with all the mingled gravity and frank good humor of a sailor in his firm,
weather-tinted countenance. To have the power of secretly contrasting his present condition
and manners with those delineated by Old Jack's episode from the "skipper's" previous biography,
was the acme of comic delight to these rude sons of Neptune, and the narrator just hit this point.

"Ye see," began he, "tis about six an' twenty years gone since I was an able seaman before
the mast, in a small Indyman they called the Chester Castle, lying at that time behind the
Isle of Dogs, in sight of Grenidge Hospital. She was full laden, but there was a strong breeze
blowing up that wouldn't let us get under weigh; and, besides, we waited for the most part
of our hands. I had sailed with the same ship two voyages before; so," says the captain to
me one day, "Jacobs, there's a lady over at Greenwich yonder wants to send her boy to sea in
the ship--for a sickening I s'pose. I am a going up to town myself," says he, "so take the
quarter-boat and two of the boys and go ashore with this letter, and see the young fool. From
what I've heard," says the skipper, "he's a jackanapes as will give us more trouble than thanks.
However, if you find the lady's bent on it, why, she may send him aboard to-morrow if she likes.
Only we don't carry no young gentlemen; and if he slings his hammock here, you must lick him
into shape. I'll make a sailor of him or a cabin-boy." "Ay, ay, sir," says I, shoving the letter
into my hat; so in half an hour's time I knocks at the door of the lady's house, rigged out
in my best, and hands over the screed to a fat fellow with red breeches and yallow swabs on
his shoulders, like a captain of marines, that looked frightened at my hail, for I thou't he'd
been deaf by the long spell he took before he opened the door. In five minutes I heard a woman's
voice ask at the footman if there was a sailor awaiting below. "Yes, marm," says he; and "show
him up," says she. Well, I gives a scrape with my larboard foot, and a tug to my hair, when
I gets to the door of such a fine room above decks, all full o' tables, an' chairs, an' sofers,
an' piangers, an' them sort o' highflying consarns. There was a lady all in silks and satins
on one of the sofers, dressed out like a widow, with a pretty little girl as was playing music
out of a large book--and a picter of a man upon the wall, which I at once logged it down for
him she'd parted company from. "Sarvint, ma'am," says I. "Come in, my good man," says the lady.
"You're a sailor?" says she--asking, like, to be sure if I warn't the cook's mate in dish-guise,
I fancy. "Well, marm," I raps out, "I make bould to say as I hopes I am!"--an' I catches a
sight o' myself in a big looking-glass behind the lady, as large as our sky-sail,--and, being
a young fellow in them days, thinks I, "Blow me, if Betsy Brown asked me that now, I'd ask
her if she was a woman!" "Well," says she, "Captain Steel tells me in this here letter, he's
agoing to take my son." Now," says she, "I'm sore against it--couldn't you say some'at to turn
his mind?" "The best way for that, yer ladyship," says I, "is to let him go, if it was only
the length of the Nore. The sea'll turn his stomack for him, marm," I says, "an' then we can
send him home by a pilot." "He wanted for to go into the navy," says the lady again, "but I
couldn't think on that for a moment, on account of this fearful war; an', after all, he'll
be safer in sailing at sea nor in the army or navy--don't you think so, my good man?" "It's
all you knows about it," thinks I; hows'ever, I said there wasn't a doubt on it. "Is Captain
Steel a rash man?" says she. "How so, marm?" says I, some'at taken aback. "I hope he does not
sail at night, or in storms, like too many of his profession, I'm afeard," says she; "I hope
he always weighs the anchor in such cases, very careful." "Oh, in course," says I, not knowin',
for the life of me, what she meant. I didn't like to come the rig over the poor lady, seein'
her so anxious like; but it was no use, we was on such different tacks, ye see. "O yes, marm,"
I says, "Captain Steel al'ays reefs taups'ls at sight of a squall brewing to wind'rd; and we're
as safe as a church, then, ye know, with a man at the wheel as knows his duty." "This relieves
my mind," the lady says, "very much; but I couldn't think why she kept sniffing all the time
at her smelling bottle, as she wor agoin to faint. "Don't take it to heart so, yer ladyship,"
I says at last; "I'll look after the young gentleman till he finds his sea-legs." "Thank you,"
says she; "but, I beg your pardon, would you be kind enough for to open the winder, and look
out if you see Edward? I think he's in the garding. I feel sich a smell of pitch and tar!"
I hears her say to the girl; and says she to me again, "Do you see Edward there?--call to him,
please." Accordingly, I couldn't miss sight of three or four young slips alongside, for they
made plenty of noise--one of 'em on top of a water-barrel smoking a cigar; another singing
out inside of it for mercy; and the rest roaring round about it, like so many Bedlamites. "No
wonder the young scamp wants to go to sea," thinks I, "he's got nothin' arthly to do but mischief."
"Which is the young gentleman, marm?" says I, lookin' back into the room--"Is it him with the
cigar and the red skull-cap?" "Yes," says the lady--"call him up, please." "Hallo!" I sings
out, and all runs off but him on the barrel, and "Hallo!" says he. "You're wanted on deck,
sir," I says; and in five minutes in comes my young gemman, as grave as you please. "Edward,"
says the mother, "this is one of Captain Steel's men." "Is he going to take me?" says the young
fellow, with his hands in his pockets. "Well, sir," I says, "'tis a very bad look-out, is the
sea, for them as don't like it. You'll be sorry ten times over you've left sich a berth as
this here afore you're down Channel." The young chap looks me all over from clue to earing,
and says he, "My mother told you to say that!" "No sir," says I, "I says it on my own hook."
"Why did you go yourself then?" says he. "I couldn't help it," answers I. "Oh," says the impertinent
little devil, "but you're only one of the common sailors, ain't you?" "Split me, you little
beggar?" thinks I, "if I doesn't show you the odds betwixt a common sailor, as ye call it,
and a lubber of a boy, before long!" But I wasn't goin' to let him take the jaw out o' me,
so I only laughed, an' says I, "Why, I'm captain of the foretop at sea, any how." "Where's
your huniform, then?" says the boy, lowering his tone a bit. "O," I says, "we doesn't al'ays
wear huniform, ye know, sir. This here's what we call on-dress." "I'm sorry, sir," says the
lady, "I didn't ax you to sit down." "No offence at all, marm," I says, but I took a couple
o' glasses of brandy as was brought in. I saw 'twas no use goin' against the young chap; so,
when he asked what he'd have to do aboard, I told him nothing to speak of, except count the
sails now and then, look over the bows to see how the ship went, and go aloft with a spy-glass.
"Oh," says his mother, at this, "I hope Captain Steel won't never allow Edward to go up those
dangerous ladders! It is my partic'lar request he should be punished if he does." "Sartainly,
marm, I'll mention it to the captain," I says, "an' no doubt he'll give them orders as you
speak on." "The captain desired me to say the young gentleman could come aboard as soon as
he likes," says I, before goin' out of the door. "Very well, sir," says the lady, "I shall
see the tailor this same afternoon, and get his clothes, if so be it must." The last word I
said was, putting my head half in again to tell 'em, "There was no use gettin' any huniforms
at present, seein' the ship's sail-maker could do all as was wanted afterwards, when we got
to sea."

Well, two or three days after, the captain sent word to say the ship would drop down with the
morning tide, and Master Collins had better be aboard by six o'clock. I went ashore with the
boat, but the young gemman's clothes warn't ready yet; so it was made up he was to come aboard
from Gravesend the day after. But his mother and an old lady, a friend of theirs, would have
it they'd go and see his bed-room, and take a look at the ship. There was a bit of breeze with
the tide, and the old Indiaman bobbed up and down on it in the cold morning; you could hear
the wash of water poppling on to her rudder, with her running gear blown out in a bend; and
Missus Collins thought they'd never get up the dirty black sides of the vessel, as she called
'em. The other said her husband had been a captain, an' she laid claim to a snatch of knowledge.
"Sailor," says she to me, as we got under the quarter, "that there tall mast is the main-bowsprit,
ain't it? and that other is the gallant bowling you call it, don't you?" says she. "No doubt,
marm," says I, winking to the boys not to laugh. "It's all right," I says. Howsoever, as to
the bed-room, the captain showed 'em over the cabin, and put 'em off by saying the ship was
so out of order he couldn't say which rooms was to be which yet, though they needn't fear Master
Ned would get all comfortable; so ashore the poor woman went, pretty well pleased, considerin'
her heart was against the whole consarn.

Well, the next afternoon, lying off Gravesend, out comes a wherry with young master. One of
the men said there was a midshipman in it. "Midshipman be blowed!" says I; "did ye ever see
a reefer in a wherry, or sitting out 'o the starn-sheets? It's neither more nor less nor the
greenhorn we've got." "Why don't the bo'sun pipe to man sideropes for him!" says th' other;
"but, my eye, Bob," says he to me; "what a sight of traps the chap's got in the boat! 'twill
be enough to heel the Chester Castle to the side he berths upon, on an even keel. Do he mean
to have the captain's cabin, I wonder!" Up the side he scrambles, with the help of a side-ladder,
all togged out to the nines in a span-new blue jacket and anchor buttons, a cap with a gould
band, and white ducks made to fit--as jemmy-jessamy a looking fellow as you'd see of a cruise
along London parks, with the waterman singing out alongside to send down a tackle for the dunnage,
which it took a pair of purchase-blocks to hoist them out on board. "What's all this?" says
the mate, coming for'ard from the quarter-deck. "'Tis the young gemman's traps, sir," I says.
"What the devil!" says the mate, "d'ye think we've room to stow all this lumber? Strike it
down into the forehold, Jacobs--but get out a blue shirt or two, and a Scotch cap for the young
whelp first, if he wants to save that smooth toggery of his for his mammy. You're as green
as cabbage, I'm feared, my lad!" says he. By this time the boy was struck all of a heap, an'
didn't know what to say when he saw the boat pulling for shore, except he wanted to have a
sight of his bed-room. "Jacobs," says the mate, laughing like an old bear, "take him below,
and show him his bed-room, as he calls it!" So down we went to the half-deck, where the carpenter,
bo'sun, and three or four of the 'prentices, had their hammocks slung. There I left him to
overhaul his big donkey of a chest, which his mother had stowed it with clothes enough for
a lord ambassador, but not a blessed thing fit to use--I wouldn't 'a given my bit of a black
box for the whole on it, ten times over. There was another chockful of gingerbread, pots o'
presarves, pickles, and bottles; and, thinks I, "The old lady didn't know what shares is at
sea, I reckon. 'Twill all be gone for footing, my boy, before you've seen blue water, or I'm
a Dutchman."

In a short time we was up anchor, going down with a fast breeze for the Nore; and we stood
out to sea that night, havin' to join a convoy off Spithead. My gentleman was turned in all
standing, on top o' some sails below; and next day he was as sick as a greenhorn could be,
cleaning out his land-ballast where he lay, nor I didn't see him till he'd got better. 'Twas
blowing a strong breeze, with light canvas all in aloft, and a single reef in the tops'ls;
but fine enough for the Channel, except the rain--when what does I see but the "Green Hand"
on the weather quarter-deck, holding on by the belaying-pins, with a yumbrella over his head.
The men for'ard was all in a roar, but none of the officers was on deck save the third mate,
The mate goes up to him, and looks in his face. "Why," says he, "you confounded long-shore
picked-up son of a green-grocer, what are you after?" an' he takes the article a slap with
his larboard-flipper, as sent it flying to leeward like a puff of smoke. "Keep off the quarter-deck,
you lubber," says he, giving him a wheel down into the lee-scuppers--"it's well the captain
didn't catch ye!" "Come aft here, some of ye," sings out the third mate again, "to brace up
the main yard; and you, ye lazy beggar, clap on this moment and pull!" At this the greenhorn
takes out a pair o' gloves, shoves his fingers into 'em, and tails on to the rope behind. "Well,
dammit!" says the mate, "if I ever see the likes o' that! Jacobs, get a tarbucket and dip his
fists in it; larn him what his hands was made for! I never could bear to see a fellow ashore
with his flippers shoed like his feet; but at sea, confound me, it would make a man green-sick
over again!" If you'd only seen how Master Collins looked when shoved his missy fingers into
the tar, and chucked the gloves o' board! The next moment he ups fists and made slap at me,
when in goes the brush in his mouth; the mate gives him a kick astarn; the young chap went
sprawling down into the half-deck ladder, where the carpenter had his shavin'-glass rigged
to crop his chin--and there he gets another clip across the jaws from Chips. "Now," says the
mate, "the chap'll be liker a sailor to-morrow. He's got some spunk in him, though, by the
way he let drive at you, my lad," says he: "that fellow 'll either catch the cat or spoil the
monkey. Look after him, Jacobs, my lad," says the third mate; "he's in my watch, and the captain
wants him to rough it out; so show him the ropes, and let him taste an end now an' then. Ha!
ha! ha!" says he again, laughing, "'tis the first time I ever see a embreller loosed out at
sea, and but the second I've seen brought aboard even! He's the greenest hand, sure enough,
it's been my luck to come across! But green they say's nigh to blue, so look out if I don't
try to make a sailor of the young spark!"

Well, for the next three or four days the poor fellow was knocked about on all hands; he'd
got to go aloft to the 'gallant cross-trees, and out on the yard foot-ropes the next morning,
before breakfast; and, coming down, the men made him fast till he sent down the key of his
bottle-chest to pay his footing. If he closed his eyes a moment in the watch, slash comes a
bucket full o' Channel water over him; the third mate would keep him two hours on end, larnin'
to rig out a sternsail boom, or grease a royal mast. He led a dog's life of it too, in the
half-deck: last come, in course, has al'ays to go and fill the bread barge, scrub the planks,
an' do all the dirty jobs. Them owners' 'prentices, sich as he had for messmates, is always
worse to their own kind by far nor the "common sailors," as the long-shore folks calls a foremast-man.
I couldn't help takin' pity on the poor lad, being the only one as had seen the way of his
up-bringing, and I felt a sort of a charge of him like; so one night I had a quiet spell with
him in the watch, an' as soon as I fell to speak kind-ways, there I seed the water stand i'
the boy's eyes. "It's a good thing," says he, tryin' to gulp it down--"it's a good thing mother
don't see all this!" "Ho, ho," says I, "my lad, 'tis all but another way of bein' sea-sick!
You doesn't get the land cleared out, and snuff the sea blue breeze nat'ral like, all at once!
Hows'ever, my lad," says I, "take my advice--bring your hammock an' chest into the fok'sle;
swap half your fine clothes for blue shirts and canvas trowsers; turn-to ready and willing,
an' do all that's asked you--you'll soon find the differ 'twixt the men and a few petty officers
an' 'prentices half out their time. The men 'll soon make a sailor of you: you'll soon see
what a seaman is; you'll larn ten times the knowledge; an', add to that, you'll not be browbeat
and looked jealous on!"

Well, next night, what does he do but follows what I said, and afore long most of his troubles
was over; nor there wasn't a willin'er nor a readier hand aboard, and every man was glad to
put Ned through anything he'd got to do. The mates began to take note on him; and though the
'prentices never left off callin' him the Green Hand, before we rounded the Cape he could take
his wheel with the best of them, and clear away a sternsail out of the top in handsome style.
We were out ten months, and Ned Collins stuck to the fork'sle throughout. When we got up the
Thames, he went ashore to see his mother in a check shirt, and canvas trowsers made out of
an old royal, with a tarpaulin hat I built for him myself. He would have me to come the next
day over to the house for a supper; so, having took a kindness to the young chap, why, I couldn't
say nay. There I finds him in the midst of a lot o' soft-faced chaps and young ladies, a spinning
the wonderfullest yarns about the sea and the East Ingees, makin' 'em swallow all sorts of
horse-marines' nonsense, about marmaids, sea-sarpents, and sich like. "Hallo, my hearty!" says
he, as soon as he saw me, "heave a-head here and come to an anchor in this here blessed chair."
"Young ladies," says he, "this is Bob Jacobs, as I told you kissed a marmaid hisself. He's
a wonderful hand, is Bob, for the fair!" You may fancy how flabbergasted I was at this, though
the young scamp was as cool as you please, and wouldn't ha' needed much to make him kiss 'em
all round; but I was al'ays milk-an'-water along side of women, if they topped at all above
my rating. "Well," thinks I, "my lad, I wouldn't ha' said five minutes agone there was anything
of the green about ye yet, but I see it will take another voy'ge to wash it all out." For to
my thinkin', mates, 'tis more of a land-lubber to come the rig over a few poor creatures that
never saw blue water, than not to know the ropes you warn't told. "O Mister Jacobs!" says Missus
Collins to me that night, before I went off, "d'ye think Edward's tired of that ere horridsome
sea yet?" "Well, marm," I says, "I'm afeard not. But I'll tell ye, marm," says I, "if you want's
to make him cut the consarn, the only thing ye can do is to get him bound apprentice to it.
From what I've seen of him, he's a lad that won't bear aught again his liberty; an' I do believe,
if he thought he couldn't get free, he'd run the next day!" Well, after that, ye see, I didn't
know what more turned up of it; for I went myself round to Hull, and ships in a timber-craft
for the Baltic, just to see some'at new.

One day, the third voy'ge from that time, on getting the length of Blackwall, we heared of
a strong press from the men-o'-war; and as I'd got a dreadful dislike to the sarvice, there
was a lot of us marchant-men kept stowed away close in holes an' corners till we could suit
ourselves. At last we got well tired, and a shipmate o' mine and I wanted to go and see our
sweethearts over in the town. So we hired the slops from a Jew, and makes ourselves out to
be a couple o' watermen, with badges to suit, a carrying off a large parcel and a ticket on
it. In the arternoon we came back again within sight of the Tower, where we saw the coast was
clear, and made a fair wind along Rosemary Lane and Cable Street. Just then we saw a tall young
fellow, in a brown coat, an' a broad-brim hat, standing in the door of a shop, with a paper
under his arm, on the look out for some one. "Twig the Quaker, Bob!" my shipmate says to me.
As soon as he saw us, out the Quaker steps, and says he to Bill, in a sleepy sort of a v'ice,
"Friend, thou'rt a waterman, I b'lieve?" "D---- it, yes," says Bill, pretty short like, "that's
what we hails for! D'ye want a boat, master?" "Swear not, friend," says the broad-brim; "but
what I want is this, you see. We have a large vessel, belonging to our house, to send to Havannah,
and willin' to give double wages, but we can't find any mariners at this present for to navigate.
Now," says he, "I s'pose this onfortunate state o' things is on account of the sinful war as
is goin' on--they're afraid of the risk. Hows'ever, my friends," says he, "perhaps, as you
knows the river, ye could put us upon a way of engagin' twenty or more bold mariners, as is
not afeard of ventering for good pay?" and with this he looks into his papers; and says Bill,
"Well, sir, I don't know any myself--do you, Bob?" and he gives me a shove, and says under
the rose, "no fear, mate," says Bill, "he's all over green--don't slip the chance for all hands
of us at Jobson's." "Why, master," I says, "what ud you give them mariners you speaks on, now?"
"Six pounds a month, friend," says he, looking up; "but we gives tea in place of spirits, and
we must have steady men. We can't wait, neither," says he, "more nor three days, or the vessel
won't sail at all." "My eye!" says Bill, "'twont do to lose, Bob!--stick to him, that's all."
"Well, sir," I says, "I thinks I does have a notion of some't of the sort. If you sends your
papers to Jobson's Tavern to-night, in the second lane 'twixt Barnaby Street and the Blue Anchor
Road, over the water, why, I'll get ye as many hands to sign as you wants!" "Thanks, friend,"
says the young broad-brim, "I will attend to thine advice,"--so he bids us good day, and stepped
into his door again. "Bill," says I, as he went off, "now I think on it, I can't help a notion
I've seen that chap's face afore!" "Very like," says Bill, "for the matter o' that 'tis the
same with me--them broad-brims is so much of a piece! But that 'ere fellow don't know nothing
of ships, sure enough, or he wouldn't offer what he did, and the crimps' houses all of a swarm
with hands!"

"Take my word, mate," says I, "it's a paying trip, or he wouldn't do it--leave a Quaker alone
for that! Why, the chap's a parfit youngster, but I am blessed if he don't look as starched
as if he'd sat over a desk for twenty year!"

Well, strike me lucky, mates all, if the whole affair warn't a complete trap! Down comes a
clerk with the papers, sure enough--but in ten minutes more the whole blessed lot of us was
puckalowed, and hard an' fast, by a strong press-gang. They put us into a cutter off Redriff
Stairs, an' the next noon all hands was aboard of the Pandora frigate at Sheerness. The first
time of being mustered on deck, says Bill to me, "Cuss my eyes, Bob, if there isn't the 'farnal
Quaker!" I looked, and sees a midshipman in uniform like the rest, and so it was. "The sly
soft-sauderin' beggar!" says I. "All fair in war, and a press-mate!" says one o' the frigate's
men. All the while I kept looking and looking at the midshipman; and at last I says to Bill
when we got below, giving a slap to my thigh, "Blessed if it ain't! it's the Green Hand himself!"
"Green Hand!" says Bill, sulky enough, "who's the Green Hand? Blow me Bob, if I don't think
we're the green hands ourselves, if that's what you're upon!" So I told him the story about
Ned Collins. "Well," says he, "if a fellow was green as China rice, cuss me if the reefers'
mess wouldn't take it all out on him in a dozen watches. The softest thing I know, as you say,
Bob, just now, it's to come the smart hand when you're a lubber; but to sham green after that
style, ye know, why, 'tis a mark or two above either you or I, messmate. So for my part, I
forgives the young scamp, 'cause I ought to ha' known better!"

By the time the frigate got to sea, the story was blown over the whole maindeck; many a good
laugh it gave the different messes; and Bill, the midshipman, and I, got the name of the "Three
Green Hands."

One middle-watch, Mister Ned comes for'ard by the booms to me, and says he, "Well, Bob Jacobs,
you don't bear a grudge, I hope!" "Why," says I, "Mister Collins, 'twould be mutiny now, I
fancy, you bein' my officer!" so I gave a laugh; but I couldn't help feeling' hurt a little,
'twas so like a son turnin' against his father, as 'twere. "Why Bob," says he, "did ye think
me so green as not to know a seaman when I saw him? I was afeared you'd know me that time."
"Not I, sir," I answers: "why, if we hadn't sailed so long in company, I wouldn't know ye now!"
so master Ned gave me to understand it was all for old times he wanted to ship me in the same
craft; but he knew my misliking to the sarvice, though he said he'd rather ha' lost the whole
haul of 'em nor myself. So many a yarn we had together of a dark night, and for a couple of
years we saw no small service in the Pandora. But if ye'd seen Ned the smartest reefer aboard,
and the best liked by the men, in the fore-taups'l bunt in a gale, or over the maindeck hatch,
with an enemy's frigate to leeward, or on a spree ashore at Lisbon or Naples, you wouldn't
ha' said there was anything green in his eye, I warrant ye! He was made acting lieutenant of
a prize he cut out near Chairboorg, before he passed examination; so he got me for prize bo'sun,
and took her into Plymouth. Soon after that the war was ended, and all hands of the Pandora
paid off. Master Ned got passed with flying colors, and confirmed lieutenant besides, but he
had to wait for a ship. He made me say where I'd be found, and we parted company for about a year.

Well, I was come home from a short trip, and one day Leftenant Collins hunts me up at Wapping
Docks, where I'd had myself spliced, six years before, to Betsy Brown, an' was laid up for
a spell, havin' seen a good deal of the sea. Ye must know the young leftenant was fell deep
in love with a rich Indy Naboob's daughter, which had come over to take her back to' the East
Indgees. The old fellow was hard close-hauled against the match, notwithstanding of the young
folks makin' it all up; so he'd taken out berths aboard of a large Company's ship, and bought
over the captain on no account to let any king's navy man within the gangways, nor not a shoulder
with a swab upon it, red or blue, beyond the ship's company. But, above all, the old tyrant
wouldn't have a blue-jacket, from stem to starn, if so be he'd got nothing ado but talk sweet;
I s'pose he fancied his girl was mad after the whole blessed cloth. The leftenant turns over
this here log to me, and, says he, "I'll follow her to the world's end, if need be, Bob, and
cheat the old villain?" "Quite right too, sir," says I. "Bob," says he, "I'll tell ye what
I wants you to do. Go you and enter for the Seringpatam at Blackwall, if you're for sea just
now; I'm goin' for to s'cure my passage myself, an' no doubt doorin' the voy'ge something'll
turn up to set all square; at any rate, I'll stand by for a rope to pull!" "Why here's a go!"
thinks I to myself: "is Ned Collins got so green again, spite of all that's come an' gone,
for to think the waves is agoin' to work wonders, or ould Neptune under the line's to play
the parson and splice all!" "Well, sir," I says, "but don't you think the skipper will smoke
your weather-roll, sir, at sea, as you did Bill Pikes an' me, you know, sir?" says I. "Oh,
Bob, my lad," says the leftenant, "leave you that to me. The fellow most onlikest to a sailor
on the Indyman's poop will be me, and that's the way you'll know me!"

Well, I did ship with the Seringpatam for Bombay. Plenty of passengers she had, but only clerks,
naboobs, old half-pay fellows, and ladies, not to speak o' children and nurses, black and white.
She sailed without my seein' Leftenant Collins, so I thought I was to hear no more on it. When
the passengers began to muster on the poop, by the time we got out o' Channel, I takes a look
over the ladies, in coilin' up the ropes aft, or at the wheel. I knowed the said girl at once
by her good looks, and the old fellow by his grumpy-yallow frontispiece. All on a sudden I
takes note of a figger coming up from the cuddy, which I made out at once for my Master Ned,
spite of his wig and a pair o' high-heeled boots, as gave him the walk of a chap treading amongst
eggs. When I hears him lisp out to the skipper at the round-house if there was any fear of
wind, 'twas all I could do to keep the juice in my cheek. Away he goes up to windward, holding
on by everything, to look over the bulwarks behind his sweetheart, givin' me a glance over
his shoulder. At night I see the two hold a sort of a collogue abaft the wheel, when I was
on my trick at the helm. After a while there was a row got up amongst the passengers, with
the old naboob and the skipper, to find out who it was that kept a singing every still night
in the first watch, alongside of the ladies' cabin, under the poop. It couldn't be cleared
up, hows'ever, who it was. All sorts o' places they said it comed from--mizen-chains, quarter-galleries,
lower-deck ports, and davit-boats. But what put the old hunks most in a rage was, the songs
was every one on 'em such as "Rule Britannia," "Bay of Biscay," "Britannia's Bulwarks," and
"All in the Downs." The captain was all at sea about it, and none of the men would say anything,
for by all accounts 'twas the best pipe at a sea-song as was to be heard. For my part, I knowed
pretty well what was afloat. One night a man comed for'ard from the wheel, after steering his
dog-watch out, and "Well I'm blessed, mates," says he on the fok'sle, "but that chap aft yonder
with the lady--he's about the greenest hand I've chanced to come across! What d'ye think I
hears him say to old Yallowchops an hour agone?" "What was it, mate?" I says. Says he, "'Do
ye know, Sar Chawls, is the hoshun reely green at the line--green ye know, Sar Chawls, reely
green?' 'No, sir,' says the old naboob, ''tis blue.' 'Whoy, ye don't sa--ay so!' says the young
chap, pullin' a long face." "Why, Jim," another hand drops in, "that's the very chap as sings
them first-rate sea-songs of a night! I seed him myself come out o' the mizen-chains!" "Hallo!"
says another at this, "then there's some'at queer i' the wind!" I thought he gave rather a
weather-look aloft, comin' on deck i' the morning! I'll bet a week's grog the chap's desarted
from the king's flag, mates! Well, ye know, hereupon I couldn't do no less nor shove in my
oar, so I takes word from all hands not to blow the gaff,[A] an' then gives 'em the whole yarn
to the very day, about the Green Hand--for somehow or another, I was always a yarning sort
of a customer. As soon as they heard it was a love consarn, not a man but swore to keep a stopper
on his jaw; only, at findin' out he was a leftenant in the Royal Navy, all hands was for touching
hats when they went past.

[Footnote A: Let out the secret.]

Hows'ever, things went on till we'd crossed the line a good while; the leftenant was making
his way with the girl at every chance. But as for the old fellow, I didn't see he was a fathom
the nearer with him; though, as the naboob had never clapt eyes on him to know him like, 'twain't
much matter before heaving in sight o' port. The captain of the Indyman was a rum old-fashioned
codger, all for plain sailing and old ways--I shouldn't say overmuch of a smart seaman. He
read the sarvice every Sunday, rigged the church an' all that, if it was anything short of
a reef-taups'l breeze. 'Twas queer enough, ye may think, to hear the old boy drawling out,
"As 'twas in the beginning,"--then, in the one key, "Haul aft the mainsheet,"--"is now and
ever shall be,"--"Small pull with the weather-brace,"--"Amen,"--"Well the mainyard,"--"The
Lord be with you,--Taups'l yard well!" As for the first orficer, he was a dandy, know-nothing
young blade, as wanted to show off before the ladies; and the second was afraid to call the
nose on his face his own, except in his watch; the third was a good seaman, but ye may fancy
the craft stood often a poor chance of being well handled.

'Twas one arternoon watch, off the west coast of Africay, as hot a day as I mind on, we lost
the breeze with a swell, and just as it got down smooth, land was made out, low upon the starboard
bow, to the south-east. The captain was turned in sick below, and the first orficer on deck.
I was at the wheel, and I hears him say to the second how the land-breeze would come off at
night. A little after, up comes Leftenant Collins, in his black wig and his 'long-shore hat,
an' begins to squint over the starn to nor'west'ard, "Jacobs, my lad," whispers he to me, "how
d'ye like the looks o' things?" "Not overmuch, sir," says I; "small enough sea-room for the
sky there!" Up goes he to the first officer, after a bit. "Sir," says he, "do ye notice how
we've risen the land within the last hour and a half?" "No, sir," says the first mate; "what
d'ye mean?" "Why, there's a current here, takin' us inside the point," says he. "Sir," says
the Company's man, "if I didn't know what's what, d'ye think I'd larn it off a gentleman as
is so confounded green? There's nothing of the sort," he says. "Look on the starboard quarter
then," says the leftenant, "at the man-o'-war bird afloat yonder with its wings spread. Take
three minutes' look," says he. Well, the mate did take a minute or two's look through the mizen-shroud,
and pretty blue he got, for the bird came abreast of the ship by that time. "Now," says the
leftenant, "d'ye think ye'd weather that there point two hours after this, if a gale come on
from the nor'west, sir?" "Well," says the first mate, "I daresay we shouldn't--but what o'
that?" "Why, if you'd cruised for six months off the coast of Africa, as I've done," says the
leftenant, "you'd think there was something ticklish about that white spot in the sky to nor'west!
But on top o' that, the weather-glass is fell a good bit since four bells." "Weather-glass!"
the mate says, "why, that don't matter much in respect of a gale, I fancy." Ye must understand,
weather-glasses wan't come so much in fashion at that time, except in the royal navy. "Sir,"
says the mate again, "mind your business, if you've got any, and I'll mind mine!" "If I was
you," the leftenant says, "I'd call the captain." "Thank ye," says the mate--"call the captain
for nothing!" Well, in an hour more the land was quite plain on the starboard bow, and the
mate comes aft again to Leftenant Collins. The clouds was beginning to grow out of the clear
sky astarn too. "Why, sir," says the mate, "I'd no notion you was a seaman at all! What would
you do yourself now, supposin' the case you put a little ago?" "Well, sir," says Mr. Collins,
"if you'll do it, I'll tell ye at once."

At this point of old Jack's story, however, a cabin-boy came from aft, to say that the captain
wanted him. The old seaman knocked the ashes out of his pipe, which he had smoked at intervals
in short puffs, put it in his jacket-pocket, and got off the windlass end. "Why, old ship!"
said the man-o'-war's-man, "are ye goin' to leave us in the lurch with a short yarn?" "Can't
help it, bo'," said Old Jack; "orders must be obeyed, ye know," and away he went. "Well, mates,"
said one, "what was the up-shot of it, if the yarn's been overhauled already? I didn't hear
it myself." "Blessed if I know," said several--"Old Jack didn't get the length last time he's
got now." "More luck!" said the man-o-war's-man; "'tis to be hoped he'll finish it next time!"

SOMETHING ABOUT A MURDER.

FOUNDED ON FACT.

A Fair and gentle girl was Barbara Comyn, the only daughter of one of the strictest and sternest
old ministers that ever adhered to Calvin. Yet Mr. Comyn was thoroughly conscientious in all
his views; and when he frowned, he did it not through love of frowning, but that he hoped,
by gathering a cloud upon his brows, to bring down from those eyes upon which he frowned such
showers of repentance as refresh and make green the soul sin-withered and sere from the harsh
and hot suns of vice. He was, in truth, a worthy and good man; somewhat narrow of mind and
bigoted of creed, it may be, but utterly incapable of committing an ungenerous or dishonorable
action. Still, greatly as he loved his winsome daughter, much as he prized her for that dead
woman's sake, who, as long as she lay in his bosom, had brought him comfort, and happiness,
and honor, he was something over-harsh with her, niggardly in the bestowing of caresses, and
liberal in the gift of unnecessary rebuke. Very severe, then, was his displeasure, when she
confessed to him, with many blushes, that she loved her young Episcopalian kinsman, John Percival.

The cousins had not been reared together, nor had they even met before the youth had passed
his twenty-fifth, the girl her nineteenth year. But we are not of the opinion that young people
are the more prone to fall in love with each other for the being educated together in a sort
of family domesticity. Such facts are contended for in fiction, but realities have convinced
us that such things seldom happen; and if we ever have the fortune to possess children of our
own, and wish a son or daughter to wed a particular individual, we shall take good care, not
only to conceal our intentions from them, but to keep the pair apart from all brother-and-sister
communism, until such time as each heart begins to have its natural craving for a congenial
spirit,--when, in sooth, it looks for others than brothers and sisters to cling to. It is a
very old, perhaps a very vulgar proverb, that "familiarity breeds contempt;" and we assuredly
think, that the constant fireside association of young folks, trained up together in bread-and-butter
ease, is more apt to generate calm friendship than warm affection.

But, as we have said, our cousins were brought up asunder; he in England, of which country
his father was an eminent physician lately deceased, who had bequeathed to his only son his
professional ability, with ample means of commencing his career in a handsome manner. When
he first came to Scotland to visit his mother's sister, he found her a corpse; and there, in
the house of mourning, the consoler of the motherless Barbara, he learnt to love her with a
sincerity of affection to which she fully responded. Great was his vexation and surprise to
receive a stern denial of his suit from the minister, who, although he had never testified
any degree of partiality for his wife's nephew, had, nevertheless, evinced no dislike of him.
But when respectfully called upon to assign a reason for so unexpected a rejection, he briefly
said, that "no child of his should with his blessing wed any man who was not a strict Presbyterian;
and that, moreover, he had other views for his daughter." Nor were the tears of his child,
nor the intercession in their favor of his kindhearted but timid old maiden sister, of any
effect. His obstinacy was not to be subdued, nor his will opposed; and the unrelenting preacher,
who taught humility, love, and concord from his pulpit, and who could produce not one sensible
reason for thwarting the attachment of two amiable creatures, concluded the scene by flying
into a furious passion, in which he gave John Percival clearly to understand, that he was no
longer an acceptable, or even permitted, guest.

The young man left the manse immediately, and was not slow in quitting Scotland; but love,
which teaches many things, taught the kinsfolk means of keeping up, though at rare intervals,
an epistolary communion--so frequently the one sustaining prop of two divided hearts!

A year or more passed, finding them true to each other. Barbara refused several excellent proposals
of marriage, nor did her father persecute her with expressed wishes for her acceptance of any
of them; until, at length, he introduced to her one Mr. Bruce, a wealthy cloth-merchant from
Glasgow. He was a man of about fifty years of age, of a well-favored and portly presence, and
accounted a sure and somewhat sour follower of Mr. Comyn's favorite creed. Barbara had frequently
heard her father speak highly of his Glasgow friend, but as no warning had prepared her, she
was very far from dreaming of the character he was about to perform in her presence; and, indeed,
the wooing of the honest clothier was neither very active nor oppressive--but, alas, for all
that, it was steadfast and resolute.

A wonderful deal of what they deemed "religious discussion" was carried on betwixt Mr. Bruce
and the minister during the visit of the former at the manse, which, we have omitted to state,
(though for certain reasons we do not intend to give it a name,) was situated out of the town
of Aberdeen, in a retired strath or valley, full of hazels and sloe-bushes, with the Dee running
through them like a huge silver snake. Although little more than half a mile from Aberdeen,
and much nearer the church of which Mr. Comyn was minister, the manse seemed as lonely and
quiet as if thirty miles lay between it and a busy, populous town. Now, though Mr. Bruce had
hired a sleeping apartment in the cottage of Mr. Comyn's bell-man, or sexton, which stood hard
by the kirk, he spent all his spare time with his friend at the manse, where his meals were
invariably taken; and in addition to the wonderful amount of polemical palaver we have hinted
at, a wonderful deal of whisky-toddy did the worthy minister and his guest contrive to swallow
in the heat of their arguments. Many a time and oft did good, innocent Miss Henny Comyn declare,
that when the shake-hands hour arrived, Mr. Bruce, "puir man, seemed to toddle aff to his cosie
beddie at Davy Bain's marvellously fu' o' the spirit!" True it was; but the ancient virgin
guessed not in her guilelessness, that the spirit was an evil one, and elicited by man and
fire from the unsuspecting barleycorn.

At last, as we have said, Mr. Comyn spoke out his wish--nay, his commands--that Barbara should
prepare to receive Mr. Bruce as a bridegroom in six months thereafter. And now Mr. Bruce himself,
a shy and dour man at other times, found courage one day, after dinner, to express his--"love;"
so he really called it, and so we suppose must we, in our extreme ignorance of the precise
category of nomenclature to which the feelings that actuated him belonged. Honest man! bigoted
and selfish as he was, he was neither cruel by nature nor cross-grained; and he was even moved
by the pathetic and frank avowal which Barbara made to him on the state of her heart. But,
though touched by her tears, he understood them not, treated them but as the natural mawkishness
of girlish sentimentality; nor had her assurance that she could never love any one but her
cousin John, power to dissuade him from the prosecution of his suit. He was void of all delicacy
of feeling, was neither hurt nor displeased with her confessed partiality for another, but
satisfied himself by quoting, misquoting, and utterly perverting Scripture, and concluded by
assuring her that it was her bounden duty to obey her father before marriage--her husband after.
He had no doubt she would be very happy as his wife, for "he was rich, and a steady Presbyterian!"
And with this declaration, threatening a return in six months to claim her hand--which he had
the audacity to kiss--he left her for his Glasgow warehouses.

In this dire dilemma the poor lassie knew not what course to pursue. Her aunt, although kind,
indulgent, and pitying her, (for in youth she had had experience of a blighted affection, and
no woman-heart, that is not naturally sour, passes through such trial without becoming sweeter)--was
bound in complete serfdom to her brother, and was quite unable to suggest any means or likelihood
of release; so Barbara wrote a full account of her predicament to her lover. Not long afterward,
so cleverly disguised by dress as to deceive even herself, Percival was again at Aberdeen--determined,
should all other methods fail, to carry off his kinswoman on the very eve of the bridal; and
many a twilight evening, when the minister sat over books or took his after-dinner nap, did
those two young creatures meet, unnoticed and unsuspected, on the banks of the Dee. But those
meetings must soon end, for six months have passed, and Mr. Bruce--once more lodged in the
house of Davy Bain--is come to wed and take home his reluctant bride.

One evening--it was cloudy and threatened foul weather, though the summer air was warm and
surcharged with flower-scents--John Percival betook himself as usual to the customary trysting-place.
It was a thick copse of hazel past which ran--heard but not seen--the river; which, where the
shrubbery ended, formed a dark, deep pool, so garnished by overhanging nut-trees that it had
acquired the name of the Nut-hole. Beyond this pool lay the road to the manse; but as the trees
here ceased to offer concealment, the Nut-tree-hole became the limits to Percival's attendance
on his cousin in her way homeward. The rustic seat in the centre of the coppice was still unoccupied,
and he began to fear that something had transpired to prevent her from coming. It was no use
to listen for the sounds of her light, advancing footsteps; for the Dee made so loud and incessant
a sough as it tumbled from the steep bank that helped to form the Nut-hole, that it drowned
all lesser sounds.

He was, however, soon made conscious that there were sounds which no sough of tumbling waters
could drown; for, on a sudden, neither remote nor suppresed, a fierce, a pitiful cry, like
that of one in some dread life-peril, struck upon his ears, succeeded by the breaking asunder
of the boughs of trees, and then a plunge in the water--a heavy plunge, that made itself heard
above the monotonous murmur of the falling flood. Astonished, almost alarmed, he rose, and
was hastening through the thicket toward the Nut-hole, whence the noise had proceeded, when,
as he was about to cross the track that led from the manse to the main road to Aberdeen, he
beheld flying toward him a dark-mantled figure: he knew it at once. Her hands stretched toward
him, her face ghastly with the death-white of intense horror, Barbara staggered toward him,
and with a sharp, short gasp, as if she dreaded to give utterance to deep fear by a louder
sound, she fainted at his very feet.

He thought no more of the Nut-hole, or of what might have happened there, absorbed in his solicitude
for his beloved cousin, but his endeavors to restore her to animation were fruitless. The manse
lay not two hundred yards distant; so at such a juncture, regardless of what the consequences
might be to himself, he bore her in his arms; and not without some difficulty, for the track
was narrow and broken up, and the night had darkened with falling rain. He reached the house.
Fortunately, there was no one in the parlor but Miss Henny; and the startled maiden, seeing
a stranger bearing the body of her niece, would have screamed, had he not at once whispered
his own name, briefly explained what had happened, and entreated her to befriend them.

"Gae awa', gae awa', laddie," said she, as she quickly brought some vinegar from the sideboard
and bathed her niece's brow with the refreshing liquid. "My brither maunna see you; nor, if
I can help it, sall he know acht o' this. Gae awa', Johnny dear; he'll be back, belive. She's
beginning to revive. I'll get her to bed, and tell him she's too ill to attend prayers. God
bless you, my ain dawtie, what's a' this?" added she, kissing the brow of the girl, whose eyes
opened to perceive the retiring form of her cousin.

If Barbara Comyn revealed to her good aunt the cause of her fright and consequent illness,
it is very certain that Miss Henny kept the secret. Next morning, indeed, though with a wan
face, Barbara appeared at prayers; and Mr. Comyn had concluded reading a portion of the Gospel,
when a paper, falling out of the Bible, arrested his attention for a moment. Only for a moment,
however; for, mentally supplicating forgiveness for that involuntary wandering of his thoughts
from the act of worship in which he was engaged, the good man knelt and prayed with fervor.
This sacred duty terminated, they sat down to the breakfast-table, and then the minister slowly
opened the paper, glanced over it, turned deadly pale, and exclaimed,

"The great and good God be around us! Let not the delusions of Satan prevail, but keep from
us the evil spirits that make us see things that are not!"

"What is the matter, brither?" cried the wondering Miss Henny, whilst, as though chained to
the table, Barbara neither moved nor spoke.

"Take this, woman," said he, in a tremulous voice, "and read it to me, that I may be sure the
same awful words that meet my sight also meet yours."

And the astonished Henrietta, taking the paper, read what follows:

     Last night, after leaving you, I was stopped by your sexton, my
     landlord, David Bain, who led me out of the highroad to the
     Nut-hole, under pretence of showing me a large salmon which he had
     hooked but could not land. He there felled me to the earth, robbed
     me, and flung my body into the river Dee. Pray for the soul of

                                                       SIMON BRUCE.

When the awe-struck Henrietta ceased, she found that Barbara had fainted; and the minister,
in a whirl of distracting thoughts to which he was unaccustomed, ascribing his child's swoon
to terror, placed the ominous paper in the Bible, and determined to make known the whole mysterious
case at once to Mr. Craigie, the chief magistrate of Aberdeen. Not for a single instant did
Mr. Comyn suspect a hoax, or imagine the affair to be only the mischievous trick of some idler.
Indeed, such was not likely; the times were superstitious, nor were there any persons connected
or at variance with the family who were liable to be suspected of having played off such a
foolish and wicked jest at the expense of the minister, even if any motive for doing so had
existed. The minister, therefore, hastened up stairs to change his coat, leaving the Bible
containing the document from the dead on the table; while his sister, finding her niece better,
left her to see that her brother's best hat and gloves were ready.

We wonder what Barbara is about meanwhile.

Presently Mr. Comyn returned to the parlor, and putting the Bible in his pocket, (for he dared
not again look at the horrible piece of writing,) set off at a quick pace for the town. Nor,
as he hurried on, did he give a passing glance at the track which diverged from the highroad
toward the Nut-tree-hole. The magistrate was at home, and great indeed was his amazement when
he heard the minister's story; but lo! when Mr. Comyn, reverently taking the Bible from his
pocket, opened it to show Mr. Craigie the note, written as he declared in the peculiar handwriting
of his friend, he found nothing where he had deposited it but a piece of blank paper, folded
up in the same form, but utterly void. And then in truth the worthy magistrate waxed somewhat
wroth; at first accusing Mr. Comyn of being credulously duped by some pawkie servant who owed
him a grudge, and ending by setting him down as "clean daft, doited, and dazed by too mickle
study," (and in his ire he had very nearly added, "too much toddy.") But, as in no amicable
frame of temper the gentlemen were about to quarrel downright, the magistrate asking the minister
what proof he could adduce of Mr. Bruce's not being alive and merry, a seasonable and loud
knocking at the street-door interrupted them; and presently a servant entered to announce that
a drowned man had been found in the Dee, and that his body had been brought to the door!

With shaking limbs the minister followed Mr. Craigie down stairs to the lobby, now full of
people. It appeared that some men employed in the salmon fisheries had, within the last hour,
dragged their nets, in which they had discovered the corpse of a man whose skull had been literally
smashed in twain by a violent blow.

It was, in fact, the body of Mr. Bruce. Here, indeed, was confirmation strange of the statement
which the mysterious and missing document had contained; and both Mr. Craigie and the minister,
exchanging looks that expressed their mutual dismay, were sorely perplexed in their own minds
how to account for these singular events. The body was reverently laid out in the hall, whilst
the magistrate, summoning some of his officials, and accompanied by the clergyman and one or
two of the fishermen, proceeded to the cottage of David Bain.

The bell-man was not at home, having gone, they said, "to Mr. Comyn's, to inquire about his
lodger, Mr. Bruce, who had not come home to his bed the night before, as was customary."

Strange glances passed between the auditors; but a sign from the magistrate imposed silence,
and they departed, determining to survey the Nut-hole, near which, in the river, the body had
been found in the nets, after which they had no doubt they would find the sexton at the manse.
As they threaded the thicket of hazel, at some distance from the pool, one of the salmon-fishers
declared, that from a plot of white-thorn and bramble-bushes he had seen the eyes of a foumart
or polecat glare out upon him; and in a low voice, directing the attention of a comrade to
the spot, they both imagined they could detect the figure of a man crouching among the trailing
shrubs. Whispering their suspicion to Mr. Craigie, he ordered the whole party to join quietly
in a search, and follow him and the minister to the Nut-hole. Thither, then, the magistrate,
attended only by Mr. Comyn, proceeded; and who, think ye, found they there?

A young man, handsome and well-dressed, in the undisguised apparel of a gentleman, stood there,
evidently unconscious of the advancing twain. He held a stout, club-like stick in his hand,
which he was examining intently--for it was covered with blood, now dried, and amidst which
stuck clots of hair! As the gentlemen came suddenly upon him he started, and dropped the stick;
whilst Mr. Comyn, staring at him in wonder, for, as we have said, all disguise had been discarded,
exclaimed--

"John Percival, is this you?"

A question which the young man could have answered in the affirmative with strict veracity,
but for the assertion from the magistrate which followed it up.

"And you, sir, are the murderer of Mr. Bruce!"

"Good God! what do you mean!" cried the horrified youth.

"That stick, which you have just dropped, is covered with blood," said Mr. Craigie; "a foul
murder has been committed, and we find you with the supposed instrument of that murder, near
the very spot where there is ground to believe the act was perpetrated."

A fearful pang shot through Percival's frame, but conscious innocence made it brief, and with
a calmness of demeanor which guilt never could have assumed, and gravely smiling, he turned
to his uncle saying--

"You cannot believe that I am guilty?"

"No, no, John!" answered the individual appealed to. "God forbid that I should judge you wrongfully,
but--"

"But," interrupted the magistrate, "not only does it appear that you have slain a man, but
that, desirous of fixing your guilt upon another, you have written a letter, falsely accusing
an innocent person of that crime."

"Letter!" repeated Percival, "Sir, I do not even know what you mean."

"Mr. Comyn," asked the magistrate, "this young man--the nephew of my lamented friend, your
late wife--paid court, as I understand, to your daughter, and was by her rejected?"

"By me, sir--by me, Mr. Craigie," answered the clergyman; "the lassie never rejected him, but
I did."

"And the murdered man," slowly pronounced the magistrate, "was the betrothed husband of Miss
Comyn?"

Percival started violently, uttering an ejaculation of horror and wonder, for at last he saw
the inferences which Mr. Craigie seemed willing to draw from circumstances that certainly looked
suspicious.

"As God is my judge, that is the truth," replied the minister, "and I had forgotten all about
it. Oh! John Percival, as you are the nephew of my beloved Mary, answer me with truth, and
say that you are innocent of this heinous deed!"

"I am indeed innocent, my dear uncle," said the young man; "nor did I know until this moment
who the unfortunate man was, of whose untimely death I am accused."

"Here he is, gentlemen; we've got him safe and sound!" cried several voices; and dragging a
wild and haggard-faced man, the fishers and officials of justice approached the trio who stood
by the Nut-tree-hole.

"The Lord be our guide!" exclaimed Mr. Comyn, "it is really David Bain!" and as the wretched
sexton struggled to free himself from the arms that pinioned him, the minister, prompted by
a sudden impulse, advancing toward him, and looking steadily in his face, said--

"David Bain, look not to deny your crime, but confess it, and implore your Maker's pardon,
even at this the eleventh hour. In my Bible, this morning, I found a paper, written by the
spirit of him you murdered here last night, and charging you with the commission of the deed."

At these strange words, which in our modern times might have produced mirth, the guilty creature,
losing all self-possession, uttered a loud cry, and pointing to the bloody cudgel which still
lay at the magistrate's feet, exclaimed--

"I did it with that! I did it with that!" and fell back in a fit.

It would be easy to lengthen out our historiette into one of circumstantial evidence, trial,
condemnation, and ultimate discovery; but we have preferred telling it as it really happened.
On the person of David Bain were found a pocket-book and purse, recognized as the property
of the late Mr. Bruce, and containing bank-notes and bills to a considerable amount; the sight
of which, in the possession of his lodger, had evoked the cupidity of the bell-man. He made
a full confession, and in due time suffered the penalty due to his offence. Meanwhile the minister,
in the thankfulness of his soul to find his nephew guiltless, embraced him tenderly, and freely
permitted that courtship to proceed between his daughter and him, which he had before so strenuously
opposed.

One circumstance still remained a mystery, undeveloped to all save Barbara's aunt, Percival,
and the worthy magistrate,--by whose advice, indeed, it was concealed from the minister; who,
to his dying day, confidently believed that the paper he had found in his Bible had been placed
there by supernatural interposition. But the hand of the dead had nothing to do with it, as
we mean to explain.

On the evening of the murder, Barbara Comyn sallied forth to meet her cousin, leaving Mr. Bruce
and her father discussing punch and polemics. She was later than usual, and as she sped along,
she became aware of the approach from Aberdeen of an individual, whom she could not avoid meeting
if she proceeded direct to the tryst. She therefore stole into a different track, thinking
to make a circuit which would occupy the time the stranger might take in passing the copse
of hazels; but, unfortunately (or fortunately, was it?), she met a poor woman, the wife of
a neighboring peasant, who was on her way to the manse to implore some black currant jelly
for a child suffering from sore throat. The call of distress was never disregarded by Barbara,
and she flew back to the manse, procured the jelly, and giving it to the woman, hastened amidst
falling rain to the trysting-place. As she was about to round the point which hid the Nut-hole
from view, she heard the sounds of struggling feet and wrestling arms; and, regardless of danger
to herself in her fears for Percival, she forced her way through some bushes, and beheld two
men, in no friendly embrace, staggering on the very verge of the pool. Before she could look
again the one had fallen on the earth; and the other, with a desperate blow of his stick on
the head of the prostrate man, uttered an oath in a voice whose peculiar tones were well-known
to Barbara, and in the twinkling of an eye shoved the wounded man over the bank into the Nut-tree
hole!

Her blood curdling with horror, Barbara found no voice, no strength, to speak or stir; but
she became, so to speak, all eye; and as the murderer, swiftly cramming into his hat and pockets
something which she could not define, rose up, and forgetful of the cudgel, which lay blood-dabbled
on the grass, rushed from the place where he had taken the burden of a deadly sin upon his
soul, she saw his face, and recognized her father's sexton--David Bain.

In terror, that found no tongue, she reached her lover, and became insensible; nor was it till
her recovery, when she found herself alone with her aunt, that she felt how important to her
future life might be the events of that night. She resolved, ere yet she spoke one word in
reply to the questions of her aunt, to ascribe her swoon to anything but the real cause; and
it was, perhaps, well she so determined, for she remembered that, in her flight from the fatal
spot where she had witnessed the perpetration of so foul a deed, she had picked up a letter,
which she had hid in her bosom, scarcely conscious of what she did, yet, perhaps, imperceptibly
aware--with the foresight of inexplicable convictions--that it might yet prove of essential
service. When she retired to her chamber, and had got rid of Aunt Henny, she took the paper
from its concealment, and saw that it was the empty cover of a letter addressed to "Mr. Bruce,
at the house of David Bain, Sexton;" and then the certainty struck her of the murdered man
being her affianced husband.

The character of David Bain was marked by extreme avarice, and Barbara's conclusions as to
the instigating cause of the crime he had committed were easily formed. But what means could
she pursue in order to convict guilt, without at the same time rendering her own appearance
before a public court of justice necessary? from which she shrank nervously, since the cause
of her presence in such a spot, and at such an hour, must of course be revealed. A sudden thought
struck her--and, wild as it was, she put it into instant execution. She knew her father's belief
in supernatural agency, and trusted strongly to the effect such a document as that which she
now prepared would have upon him. She wrote the note which Mr. Comyn discovered in the Bible,
imitating Mr. Bruce's hand, which was peculiar, as closely as she could; and then, when the
minister left it there--a circumstance which, though she did not foresee, rejoiced her--she
subtracted it thence, uninterrupted and unsuspected. But when it pleased the Almighty to make
manifest the murderer by the means thus strangely suggested to her, she confessed the whole
to the indulgent Henny and her lover, and by their advice took the magistrate also into her
confidence.

We have nothing more to relate, but that Barbara Comyn and John Percival were soon after united
by the worthy minister; whilst Miss Henny was as busy as a bee in preparations for the wedding,
and as happy in witnessing the happiness of others as if she had never known a care of her own.

THE GARDEN GATE.

  "Stand back, bewildering politics!
  I've placed my fences round;
  Pass on, with all your party tricks,
  Nor tread my holy ground.
  Stand back--I'm weary of your talk,
  Your squabbles, and your hate:
  You cannot enter in this walk--
  I've closed my garden gate.

  "Stand back, ye thoughts of trade and pelf!
  I have a refuge here;
  I wish to commune with myself--
  My mind is out of gear.
  These bowers are sacred to the page
  Of philosophic lore;
  Within these bounds no envies rage--
  I've shut my garden door.

  "Stand back, Frivolity and Show.
  It is a day of Spring;
  I want to see my roses blow,
  And hear the blackbird sing.
  I wish to prune my apple-trees,
  And nail my peaches straight;
  Keep to the causeway, if you please--
  I've shut my garden gate.

  "I have no room for such as you,
  My house is somewhat small:
  Let Love come here, and Friendships true
  I'll give them welcome all;
  They will not scorn my household stuff,
  Or criticize my store.
  Pass on--the world is wide enough--
  I've shut my garden door.

  "Stand back, ye Pomps! and let me wear
  The liberty I feel.
  I have a coat at elbows bare--
  I love its dishabille.
  Within these precincts let me rove,
  With Nature, free from state;
  There is no tinsel in the grove--
  I've shut my garden gate.

  "What boots continual glare and strife?
  I cannot always climb;
  I would not struggle all my life--
  I need a breathing time.
  Pass on--I've sanctified these grounds
  To friendship, love, and lore:
  Ye cannot come within the bounds--
  I've shut the garden door."

POETICAL COMPOSITION.--If metre and melody be worth anything at all, let them be polished to
perfection; let an author "keep his piece nine years," or ninety and nine, till he has made
it as musical as he can--at least, as musical as his other performances. Not that we counsel
dilatory and piecemeal composition. The thought must be struck off in the passion of the moment;
the sword-blade must go red-hot to the anvil, and be forged in a few seconds: true; but after
the forging, long and weary polishing and grinding must follow, before your sword-blade will
cut. And melody is what makes poetry cut; what gives it its life, its power, its magic influence,
on the hearts of men. It must ring in their ears; it must have music in itself; it must appeal
to the senses as well as to the feelings, the imagination, the intellect: then, when it seizes
at once on the whole man, on body, soul, and spirit, will it "swell in the heart, and kindle
in the eyes," and constrain him, he knows not why, to believe and to obey.--Fraser, for June.

POETRY OF THE LAST AGE AND THE PRESENT.--A writer in the last number of Fraser's Magazine says
well that, "there is in periodicals and elsewhere, a vast amount of really poetic imagery,
of true and tender feeling, and cultivated ingenuity, scattered up and down in the form of
verse. We have no new great poets, but very many small ones--layers, as it were, and seedlings
from the lofty geniuses of the last generation, showing in every line the influence of Scott,
Shelley, Burns, Wordsworth, and their compeers, seeing often farther than their masters saw,
but dwarfs on giants' shoulders. Not that we complain of this. Elizabethan ages must be followed
by Caroline ones; and our second Elizabethan galaxy is past; Tennyson alone survives, in solitary
greatness, a connecting link between the poetry of the past and that of the future. In poetry,
and in many other things, ours is a Caroline age; greater than the first one, as every modern
cycle in a God-taught world, will be nobler, richer, wiser than its ancient analogue; but still
a merely Caroline age--an age of pedantries and imbecilities, of effete rulers, side by side
with great nether powers, as yet unaccredited, anarchic, unconscious of their own laws and
destinies--an age of formalisms and Pharisaisms, of parties embittered by the sense of their
own decrepitude--an age of small men, destined to be the fathers of great ones. And in harmony
with this, we have a poetic school of Herberts and Vaughans, Withers and Daniels, to be followed
hereafter, it may be, by a Milton, of whom as yet the age has given no sign."

DEATH-BED SUPERSTITIONS.--The practice of opening doors and boxes when a person dies is founded
on the idea that the minister of purgatorial pains took the soul as it escaped from the body,
and flattening it against some closed door, (which alone would serve the purpose,) crammed
it into the hinges and hinge openings; thus the soul in torment was likely to be miserably
pinched and squeezed by the movement on casual occasion of such door or lid. An open or swinging
door frustrated this, and the fiends had to try some other locality. The friends of the departed
were at least assured that they were not made the unconscious instruments of torturing the
departed in their daily occupations. The superstition prevails in the north as well as in the
west of England; and a similar one exists in the south of Spain, where I have seen it practiced.
Among the Jews at Gibraltar there is also a strange custom when a death occurs in a house;
and this consists in pouring away all the water contained in any vessel, the superstition being
that the angel of death may have washed his sword therein.

Old authors notice the training of camels to move in measured time by placing the animal on
gradually heated plates, and at the same time sounding a musical instrument.

AN ARAB GAME.--The Arabs are far more amusable, far more jovial and open-hearted. They have
their coffee-houses every night, and their religious festivities periodically; they play at
all sorts of complicated games, resembling draughts and chess, and find means ingeniously to
vary their sports. If they compromise their dignity, they succeed in whiling away their leisure
time far more successfully than the pride-stuffed Levantine. One of their amusements--called
the game of plaff--is worth mentioning, especially as it is not only indulged in by the vulgar,
but formed the chief delight of the venerable Moharrem Bey himself. Two men, often with respectable
gray beards, sit on a carpet at a little distance one from the other. All Easterns are usually
dry smokers; but on this occasion they manage to foment a plentiful supply of saliva, and the
game simply consists in a series of attempts on the part of the two opponents to spit on the
tips of each others noses. At first, this cleanly interchange of saliva goes on slowly and
deliberately--Socrates never measured the leap of a flea with more seriousness--but presently
one receives a dab in the eye, another in the mouth. They begin to grow hot and angry. "I hit
your nose," cries one. "No, it was my cheek!" replied the other. They draw a little nearer,
in order to ascertain the truth by feeling; spit, spit, they still go, like two vicious old
cats; their palates grow dry; their throats become parched; but the contest continues, and
they exhaust themselves in making spittoons of each other's faces and beards. Hamlet and Laertes
were not more eager and desperate. "A hit, a very palpable hit!" they exclaim, as they hawk
up their last supply of ammunition. Each denies the truth; they mutually proceed to a verification,
and the game of plaff often ends in a regular match of nose-pulling.--Two Years' Residence
in a Levantine Family.

A MARRIAGE IN AMERICA.--A respectable farmer came in from some distance, and married the cook.
The bridegroom was about fifty, and the bride was thirty years of age. The landlord and many
of his boarders assisted at the ceremony, which was performed in the evening, and those of
the boarders who had not been present were invited in afterward by the bridegroom to partake
of wine and cake. After all were charged, he gave this sentiment, "Friendship to all, love
to a few, and hatred to none." So systematically were matters managed, that next morning the
bridegroom was sitting in the stove at the bar at seven o'clock, and at half-past seven breakfasted
as usual at the public table, at which, of course, his wife, the cook, did not appear, and
in the afternoon the happy pair left for their home. When I asked the landlord what the wife
was like, he answered, "She is as pretty as a picture, and straight as a candle."--Sir J. Alexander's
"Acadie," just published.

ARABIAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS IN OUR OWN TIME.--The Arabs, who have among them most imaginative
and finished improvisatori, compare the elegant movements of a beautiful bride to those of
a young camel. The Thousand and One Nights, like most clever fables, have some foundation in
fact, as is well known to the friends of the Arabian man of rank, who keeps his professed story-teller
as an indispensable part of his establishment. African travelers relate that these friends
will assemble before his tent, or on the platform with which the house of a Moorish Arab is
roofed, and there listen night after night, to a consecutive history, related for sixty or
even one hundred nights in succession. The listeners on such occasions have all the air of
being spell-bound, especially while hearing some of their native songs, which are frequently
extemporized, full of fire, and appealing with irresistible force to the passions. "I have
seen," says Major Denham, "a circle of Arabs straining their eyes with a fixed attention at
one moment and bursting with loud laughter; at the next melting into tears and clasping their
hands in all the ecstacy of grief and sympathy."--Leaves from the Diary of a Naturalist.

  THE LAST YEAR'S LEAF.

  The last year's leaf, its time is brief
    Upon the beechen spray;
  The green bud springs, the young bird sings
    Old leaf, make room for May:
        Begone, fly away,
        Make room for May.

  Oh, green bud smile on me awhile,
    Oh, young bird, let my stay--
  What joy have we, old leaf, in thee?
    Make room, make room for May:
        Begone, fly away,
        Make room for May.--Philip Taylor.

THE "PASSION PLAY" IN BAVARIA.--This year, the foreign journals state, is the year of the passion
play of the Ammergau in Bavaria. The last representation took place in the month of July; the
spectators were betwixt eight and nine thousand, collected in an open air theatre; the corps
of actors, three hundred and fifty in number, some of them, says a French account, men and
women as old as eighty years.

The play, which was written in 1633, and which had been recently retouched, is in twelve acts
and eleven entr'acts interspersed with tableaux. The representation lasted from eight o'clock
in the morning, till four in the afternoon, was most elaborately prepared, and perfectly executed.
At its close, the actors fell on their knees and recited prayers in which they thanked God
that their performance had succeeded so well. They were of the peasant class, and almost all
belonged to the Ammergau. "This same Ammer-valley," says the Athenæum, "lies in a most picturesque
country, betwixt Munich and Innspruck--on the road by the Lake of Staremberg and Partenkirch."

AMBASSADORS.--Holland, Germany, France, America, Spain, send forth their eminent lawyers, historians,
merchants, jurists, and publicists, to fill embassies and conduct negotiations; while we content
ourselves with recruiting our diplomatic corps from the younger branches of the aristocracy,
or from the sons of men of wealth apeing the manners and travestying the mode of life of the
grand seigneurs, who conceive themselves made of "the porcelain of earth's clay." The Schimmelpennicks,
the De Serres, the Rushes, the Wheatons, the Clays, the Adamses, the Jeffersons, the Rufus
Kings, the Daniel Websters, the Dr. Bankses, have all been lawyers; the Washington Irvings,
the Bancrofts, the Guizots, the Bunsens, the Niebuhrs, the Humboldts, the Ancillons, were men
of letters before and during the period they continued ambassadors.--Fraser.

M. GUIZOT has been compelled to sell at auction a portion of his valuable and extensive library,
and a London paper describes some of the more remarkable books, and states the prices for which
they were sold. "Comte Auguste de Bastard, Peintures et Ornemens des Manuscrits Français depuis
le huitième siècle jusqu'à la fin du seizième," 20 parts, all at present published, in five
portfolios, Paris, 1835. This splendid work was described as the most sumptuous, unique, and
costly book that has ever been produced. Each part contains eight plates, copied from the most
superb examples known to exist; they are colored and finished with gold and silver equal to
the exquisite originals; the whole series extends to 160 engravings in 20 livraisons, each
of which was sold to subscribers only at 1800f., amounting in the whole to 36,000f., or in
our money to 1,500l. No perfect copy of this production has been offered for sale in this country
prior to the present time; it was sold for 200l. "Voyage de la Corvette l'Astrolabe pendant
les Années, 1826, 1827, 1828, 1829, sous le Commandement de Capitaine d'Urville," containing
copious descriptions of all the objects in science and history met with on the voyage, the
whole being illustrated by splendid engravings, 30l.; "Voyage Pittoresque et Romantique en
Bretagne," one of the most magnificent and extensive works ever published on the scenery and
antiquities of any part of the world; the illustrations to this were executed in the most superb
style of lithography; the stones were broken as soon as the plates were printed; 26l. 5s.

SIR STRATFORD CANNING.--This eminent civilian and ambassador, whose former residence in this
country is remembered with so much pleasure by his friends here, is thus referred to in a series
of papers on the Diplomacy, Diplomatists, and Diplomatic Servants of England, now in course
of publication in Fraser's Magazine: "He who has been forty-three years in the public service,
who commenced his duties as precis-writer in the Foreign Office in July 1807, and who, having
served as Secretary of Embassy to the Porte, as Envoy to the Swiss Confederation, as Minister
to the United States, as Plenipotentiary on a special mission to Russia, as Plenipotentiary
on a special mission to Spain, and as Ambassador three times near the Sublime Porte, is now
serving with credit and advantage in that very Stamboul whose towers and minarets he first
saw in 1808."

THE SEVEN-MILE TUNNEL THROUGH THE ALPS.--Dr. Granville says: "To give at once some idea of
the boldness of Chev. Mons' undertaking, we may, in the first place, state that in its progress
the tunnel must pass under some of the most elevated crests of Mont Cenis,--one, in particular,
where there will be 4,850 feet of mountain, capped with eternal glaciers, over head, at the
middle of the tunnel, so that not only will the workmen and machinery in construction, and
the passengers and trains in transit, be buried to that depth in the heart of the mountain,
but all idea of shafts, either to facilitate excavation, or to promote ventilation, must be
out of the question. The breath of life itself must be respired, from either extremity, with
artificial aid, in shape of currents of fresh air transmitted, and of foul air withdrawn, by
mechanical apparatus ever at work, at least during excavation, which is also itself to be effected
by machinery of a new and simple nature, worked by water-power of mountain streams whereby
the trains are also to be run through the tunnel, which ascends, from the northern or Savoy
side, at Modane, all the way to its exit at Bardonneche, with a gradient equal to 19 in 1000.
The machine, once presented to the rock, projects into it simultaneously four horizontal series
of sixteen scalpels, working backward and forward, by means of springs cased in, and put in
motion by the same water power. While these are at work, one vertical series on each side works
simultaneously up and down, so that together they cut out four blocks, or rather insulate four
blocks on all sides, except on the rock behind, from which they are afterward detached by hand.
It has been already ascertained that each of the two machines, at the opposite ends of the
tunnel, will excavate to the extent of 22 feet a day, and it is estimated that the whole excavation
will be completed in four years. The gallery to be perforated by the machines will be 13 feet
wide by 7 feet high, and this once cut through, the bore will be enlarged by ordinary means
to 25 feet in width and 19 feet in height, and a double line of rails laid. The estimated cost
of this great tunnel is only 13,804,942f. It is to be immediately commenced at the north entrance."
