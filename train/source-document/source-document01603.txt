Wilson suggests as alternatives to the chromosome sex determinant theory according to Mendel's
Law, (1) that the heterochromosomes may merely transmit sex characters, sex being determined
by protoplasmic conditions external to the chromosomes; (2) That the heterochromosomes may
be sex-determining factors only by virtue of difference in activity or amount of chromatin,
the female sex chromosome in the male being less active. The first of these alternatives is
an attempt to cover such cases as Dinophilus, Hydatina, and Phylloxera with large female and
small male eggs. Here Morgan's ('06) suggestion as to degenerate males seems much to the point.
The male sex character, having become dominant in certain eggs at an early stage, may, from
that time on, determine the kind of development. As to the second alternative, I see no reason
for supposing that the small heterochromosome of a pair is in any different condition, as to
activity, from the large one. The condensed condition may not mean inactivity, but some special
form of activity. And, moreover, it has been shown that in certain stages of the development
of the oöcyte of one form, Aphrophora quadrangularis, there are pairs of condensed chromosomes
corresponding to those of the spermatocyte, so that there would hardly seem to be any basis
for Wilson's attempt to associate the difference in development of male and female germ cells
with activity or inactivity of chromosomes, as indicated by condensed or diffuse condition
of the chromatin.

On the whole, the first theory, which brings the sex determination question under Mendel's
Law in a modified form, seems most in accordance with the facts, and makes one hopeful that
in the near future it may be possible to formulate a general theory of sex determination.

This work has been done in connection with a study of the problem of sex determination, but,
whatever may be the final decision on that question, it brings together a mass of evidence
in favor of the belief in both morphological and physiological individuality of the chromosomes,
as advocated by Boveri, Sutton, and Montgomery. It also gives the strongest kind of evidence
that maternal and paternal homologues unite in synapsis and separate in maturation, leaving
the ripe germ cells pure with regard to each pair of characters.
