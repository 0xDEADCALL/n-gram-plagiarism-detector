TO I.K. TEFFT, ESQ., WILLIAM B. STEVENS, M.D., AND A.A. SMETS, ESQ., OF SAVANNAH;

  "Thy great example will in glory shine,
  A favorite theme with Poet and Divine;
  Posterity thy merits shall proclaim,
  And add new honor to thy deathless fame."

On his return from Georgia, 1735.

 The writer of this elegant encomium, adds this remark: "AN
AUTHENTIC AND TOLERABLY MINUTE LIFE OF OGLETHORPE IS A DESIDERATUM."
Such a desideratum I have endeavored to supply. This, however, has
been a very difficult undertaking; the materials for composing it,
excepting what relates to the settlement of Georgia, were to be sought
after in the periodicals of the day, or discovered by references to
him in the writings or memoirs of his contemporaries. I have searched
all the sources of information to which I could have access, with the
aim to collect what had been scattered; to point out what had been
overlooked; and, from the oblivion into which they had fallen, to
rescue the notices of some striking incidents and occurrences in the
life of Oglethorpe, in order to give consistency and completeness to
a narrative of the little that had been preserved and was generally
known.

[Footnote 1: Gulian Veerplanck, Esq. Anniversary Discourse before the New York Historical Society,
December 7, 1818, page 33.]

To use the words of one who had experience in a similar undertaking: "The biographer of our
day is too often perplexed in the toil of his researches after adequate information for composing
the history of men who were an honor to their age, and of whom posterity is anxious to know
whatever may be added to increase the need of that veneration, which, from deficient knowledge,
they can but imperfectly bestow."

My collected notices I have arranged so as to form a continuous narrative, though with some
wide interruptions. The statements of the most important transactions have generally been made
in the terms of original documents, or the publications of the day; as I deemed it more just
and proper so to do, than to give them my own coloring. And I must apprize the reader, that
instead of aiming to express the recital in the fluency of rhetorical diction, or of aspiring
to decorate my style of composition with studied embellishments, MY PURPOSE HAS SIMPLY AND
UNIFORMLY BEEN TO RELATE FACTS IN THE MOST PLAIN AND ARTLESS MANNER; and I trust that my description
of scenes and occurrences will be admitted to be natural and free from affectation; and my
inferences, to be pertinent, impartial, and illustrative. I hope, too, that it will not be
thought that the detail of circumstances is needlessly particular, and the relation of incidents
too minute. For, these, though seemingly inconsiderable, are not unimportant; and, though among
the minor operations of active life, serve to indicate the state of existing opinions and prevailing
motives, and to exhibit the real aspect of the times. They also have, more or less, relation
to forth-coming events. They are foot-prints in the onward march to "enterprises of great pith
and moment;" and hence should be carefully traced and inspected. Though my authorities are
duly noted, I have not been so particular as to distinguish every passage which I had transcribed
by marks of quotation; and, therefore, being willing that this work should be considered as
mainly a compilation, with unassuming pretensions, entitle it BIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIALS.

After the lapse of more than a century since Oglethorpe entered on the stage of action, it
cannot be expected that the varied incidents of so busy, eventful, and long protracted a life
as was his, can be brought out and fully described; or that the prominent personal qualities
of so singular a character can be delineated, for the first time, with vivid exactness and
just expression. Not having presumed to do this, I have attempted nothing more than a general
outline or profile.

Such as I have been able to make the work, I present it to the public. Whatever may be the
reception which it may meet, I shall never think the moments misspent, which were devoted to
the purpose of reviving the memory of Oglethorpe, and of perpetuating his fame by a more full
recital of his deeds than had been heretofore made.

BOSTON, July 7th, 1838.

Since the preceding preface was written, the Reverend Charles Wallace Howard, who had been
commissioned by the Legislature of Georgia to procure from the public offices in London, a
copy of the records of the Trustees for the settlement of the Province, and of other colonial
documents, has returned, having successfully accomplished the object of his mission. It may
be thought that these are of such importance that all which I have done must be defective indeed,
unless I avail myself of them; and so, perhaps, it may prove. But my advanced old age, my feeble
state of health, and other circumstances, prevent my doing so. I console myself, however, with
the consideration that as they consist of particulars relative to the settlement and early
support of Georgia, to which Oglethorpe devoted not quite eleven years of a life extended to
nearly a hundred, they would only contribute to render more distinct the bright and glorious
meridian of his protracted day,--while I aimed to exhibit its morning promise and its evening
lustre;--endeavoring to give some account of what he was and did forty-four years before he
commenced "the great emprise," and where he was and how occupied forty-two years after its
accomplishment.

Moreover, the official records contain, principally, a detail of the plans and measures which
were adopted and pursued by the Trustees in London, or comprise the statement of public grants
of money, and military stores and forces;--and these belong to History, and not to Biography.

The Letters of Oglethorpe, besure, would be exceedingly interesting; but I presume that much
of what they refer to may be collected from pamphlets and periodicals of the day, where he
is spoken of as he would not feel free to speak of himself. As from these I have collected
the most material particulars, I cannot think that my actual deficiencies in the history of
that eventful period can be very considerable or important.

From a correspondence with I.K. TEFFT, Esq. and WILLIAM B. STEVENS, M.D., of Savannah, I have
obtained the clearer statement of some important facts and occurrences, which is respectfully
noticed where introduced, and for which I render my grateful acknowledgments. The latter gentleman
has also obligingly favored me with an article on the culture of silk in Georgia, which graces
my appendix.

  I have done the best I could with scanty store;
  Let abler man, with ample means, do more;
  Yet not deficiencies of mine decry,
  Nor make my gatherings his own lack supply.

May 1st, 1841.

The date, at the close of the first preface, indicates that the publication of this work had
been suspended.--A subsequent epistolary correspondence, in reference to it, with friends at
Savannah, excited promptings, which were succeeded by a list of nearly two hundred subscribers
for the volume in print;--a list that included the names of the most respectable gentlemen
of the city, among whom were those that held distinguished stations and filled important offices
in public life.

For this flattering encouragement and honorary patronage, the most grateful acknowledgments
are rendered.

The name of the capital of South Carolina was originally written Charles-Town and Charles'
Town. At the time of the early settlement of Georgia it had become blended in the compound
word Charlestown, which, being found in the documents referred to or quoted in this work, is
retained here, though of later years it is spelt Charleston.

In the following pages variations occur in the names of persons and places, principally in
the extracts from German publications. This lack of uniformity in some instances, as also a
few verbal errors in others, was not detected till the sheets had passed the press.

  "Acres circumfert centum licet Argus ocellos,
  Non tamen errantes cernat ubique typos."

XXVIII.

James Oglethorpe, founder of the Colony of Georgia in North America,--a distinguished philanthropist,
general, and statesman,--was the son of Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, of Godalming, in the County
of Surrey, Great Britain, by Eleanor, his wife, daughter of Richard Wall, Esq. of Rogane, in
Ireland.[1] There has been, hitherto, great uncertainty with respect to the year, the month,
and the day of his nativity; I have, however, what I deem good authority for deciding it to
have been the twenty-first day of December, one thousand six hundred and eighty-eight.[2]

[Footnote 1: For some account of the Family, see Appendix I.]

[Footnote 2: Appendix II.]

It is asserted in Thoresby's History of Leeds, page 255, that "he had two Christian names,
James-Edward, supposed to have been bestowed upon him in compliment to the Pretender;" and
he is so named on his sepulchral monument. But, as he always used but one; as he was enregistered
on entering College at Oxford, simply James; and, as the double name is not inserted in any
public act, commission, document, printed history, or mention of him in his life time, that
I have ever met with, I have not thought proper to adopt it.

When sixteen years of age, on the 9th of July, 1704, he was admitted a member of Corpus Christi
College, Oxford,[1] where his brother Lewis received his education. It seems, however, that,
after the example of that brother, as also of his brother Theophilus, he early relinquished
a literary, for a military profession; and aspired to make his way in the world, "tam Marte
quam Minerva."

[Footnote 1: The record of his admittatur, in the University Register, is,--"1704, Jul. 9,
term. S. Trin. Jacobus Oglethorpe, e C.C.C. 16. Theoph. f. Sti. Jacobi, Lond. Equ. Aur. filius
natu minor." That is, "In Trinity Term, July 9, 1704, James Oglethorpe, aged 16, youngest son
of Theophilus Oglethorpe, of St. James's, London, was admitted into Corpus Christi College."]

His first commission was that of Ensign; and it is dated in 1710; and he bore that rank in
the army when peace was proclaimed in 1713[1]. In the same year he is known to have been in
the suite of the Earl of Peterborough[2], ambassador from the Court of Great Britain to the
King of Sicily and to the other Italian States; whither he was fellow traveller with the Rev.
Dr. George Berkeley, his Lordship's Chaplain[3]. Highly honorable was such a mark of favor
from his Lordship; and peculiarly pleasant and instructive, also, must have been such companionship
with the amiable and excellent clergyman; and it afforded opportunity of concerting plans of
usefulness, of beneficence, and of philanthropy, the object and tendency of which were apparent
in the after life of each[4].

[Footnote 1: Biographical Memoir in the European Magazine, Vol. VIII. p. 13.]

[Footnote 2: NICHOLS, in the Literary Anecdotes of the XVIIIth Century, Vol. II. p. 19, says,
"he was aid-de-camp;" but as that was the title of a military rank, rather than of an attendant
on a diplomatic ambassador, I have substituted another term, which however may embrace it,
if it be really proper.]

[Footnote 3: Dr. Berkeley, in a letter to Thomas Prior, Esq., dated Turin, January 6, 1714,
n.s. says that he travelled from Lyons "in company with Col. Du Hamel and Mr. Oglethorpe, Adjutant
General of the Queen's forces; who were sent with a letter from my Lord to the King's mother,
at Turin." Works of GEORGE BERKELEY, D.D., with an Account of his Life. Dublin. 1704. 2 vols.
4to. Vol. I--p. xxx]

[Footnote 4: Appendix III.]

In 1714 he was Captain Lieutenant in the first troop of the Queen's guards. By his fine figure,
his soldierly deportment and personal bravery, he attracted the notice of the Duke of Marlborough;
whose confidence and patronage he seems long to have enjoyed, and by whom, and through the
influence of the Duke of Argyle, he was so recommended to Prince Eugene, that he received him
into his service, first as his secretary, and afterwards aid-de-camp. Thus near the person
of this celebrated general, full of ardor, and animated with heroic courage, an opportunity
was offered him in the warlike expedition against the Turks in which the Prince was engaged,
to gather those laurels in what the world calls "the field of glory," to which he aspired;
and, in several successive campaigns, he exhibited applauded proofs of chivalric gallantry
and personal bravery. By his attentive observation of the discipline, manner of battle array,
onset of the forces, and the instruction given him in military tactics, he acquired that knowledge
of the art of war, for which he afterwards became so distinguished.

At the battle of Peterwaradin, one of the strongest frontier places that Austria had against
the Turks, Oglethorpe, though present, was not perhaps actively engaged. It was fought on the
5th of August, 1716. The army of the Turks consisted of 150,000 men, of which 40,000 were Janisaries,
and 30,000 Saphis, or troopers, the rest were Tartars, Walachians, and the troops of Asia and
Egypt. The army of the Imperialists, under his Serene Highness, Prince Eugene, consisted of
but little more than half that number. The onset began at seven in the morning, and by twelve
Eugene was writing to the Emperor an account of the victory in the tent of the Grand Vizier[1].

[Footnote 1: Military History of Prince Eugene, of Savoy, (a superb work in two folio volumes,
with elegant plates; compiled by CAMPBELL.) Lond. 1737. Vol. II. p. 215. From this, and from
"The Life and Military Actions of Eugene," Lond. 1737, 12mo, the account of the battles is taken.]

After a sharp contest of about four hours, the Grand Vizier Hali, seeing the battle go against
him, put himself at the head of his guard of horse, pushed through a defile, and made a very
brisk charge; but his men could not sustain the contest; and he, having received two wounds,
was carried off the field to Carlowitz, where he died the next day. The Aga of the Janisaries
and Mahomet Bassa were also slain. The whole loss of the Turks in this action amounted to about
22,000; and of the Imperialists, 3,695 common soldiers, and 469 officers. There was found in
the camp 164 pieces of cannon, and a prodigious quantity of powder, bullets, bombs, grenades,
and various military equipments and stores; and the booty in other articles was great and rich
beyond computation.

The Imperial army passed the Danube on the 6th of August, "in order to avoid the infection
of the dead bodies." The same day a council of war was held, in which the siege of Temeswaer
was proposed and resolved on. This is a town of Hungary, upon the river Temes, whence it has
its name. It lies five miles from Lippa, towards the borders of Transylvania, and about ten
from Belgrade. The Turks took it from the Transylvanians in 1552, and fortified it to a degree
that they deemed it impregnable. After several severe conflicts, and a most desperate resistance,
it capitulated on the 14th of October, 1716, and the Turks entirely evacuated the place on
the 17th. Thus the capital of a region of the same name, was restored to its lawful prince
after having been in the hands of the Turks 164 years. "The success of this victorious campaign
filled not only Germany, but all Europe with joy." On this occasion, Oglethorpe acted as aid-de-camp;
and his active service in attendance upon Prince Eugene; his prompt attention to the orders
dictated to him, or transmitted by him; his alertness and fidelity in communicating them; and
his fearless exposure to imminent peril in passing from one division of the army to another,
gained him commendatory acknowledgments and the increased favor of his Serene Highness.

Notwithstanding these signal victories gained over them, the Turks were determined to continue
the contest; and the next year the Grand Signior held a great Divan at Constantinople to take
measures for its most vigorous prosecution. These purposes being put in train, Prince Eugene
undertook the siege of Belgrade, their chief strong hold. "The Turks advanced to its relief,
and besieged him in his camp. His danger was imminent; but military skill and disciplined valor
triumphed over numbers and savage ferocity. He sallied out of his intrenchments, and, falling
suddenly upon the enemy, routed them with great slaughter, and took their cannon, baggage,
and everything belonging to their camp. Belgrade surrendered immediately after."[1] On the
16th of August, (1717) the capitulation was signed; and immediately afterwards the Imperialists
took possession of a gate, and the out-works; on the 19th Te Deum was solemnly performed in
the tent of the Grand Vizier, which had become occupied by Eugene, and on the 22d the place
was evacuated. The Imperialists found prodigious riches in the camp of which they had become
possessed; "for the Sultan had emptied his coffers to supply this army, which was by far the
most numerous of any set on foot since the famous siege of Vienna."[2]

[Footnote 1: Russell's Modern Europe, Vol. V. p. 3.]

[Footnote 2: CAMPBELL'S Military History of Eugene, Vol. II. p. 233.]

"Such was the conclusion of the siege of Belgrade; a place of the last importance to the Imperialists
and to the Turks; the bridle of all the adjoining country; the glorious trophy of the valor
and conduct of his Serene Highness, Prince Eugene; and the bulwark, not of Germany only, but
of all Christendom on this side."

"Oglethorpe was in active command at the siege and battle of Belgrade, on the south shore of
the Danube, in 1717; where he acquired a high and deserved reputation."[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine for 1785, p. 573.]

In the postscript of a letter from Alexander Pope, dated September 8th, 1717, to Edward Blount,
Esq., is this remark: "I hope you will take part in the rejoicing for the victory of Prince
Eugene over the Turks, &c." to which Dr. Warton subjoins this note; "at which General Oglethorpe
was present, and of which I have heard him give a lively description."

The peace which took place in the following year between the Emperor and the Sultan, left Oglethorpe
without any active employment; and he quitted, doubtless with reluctance, the staff of his
friend and patron, prince Eugene, with whom he had so honorably served; and returned to England.

He was offered preferment in the German service; but it was, probably, a sufficient reason
with him for declining the proffer, that "the profession of a soldier in time of peace affords
but few opportunities of promotion, and none of distinction."

In the year 1722, succeeding his brother Lewis in the inheritance of the estate at Godalming,
his weight of character and family influence secured to him a seat in Parliament, as Burgess,
for Haslemere; and he continued to represent that borough, by successive elections, and through
various changes of administration, for thirty-two years; and, "during this long period, he
distinguished himself by several able speeches; and, in the laws for the benefit of trade,
&c. many regulations were proposed and promoted by him."

In this august assembly, he was neither a dumb show, nor an automaton; nor the tool of party;
but independent, intelligent, and energetic, delivered his opinions freely, spoke often, and
always to the purpose.[1]

[Footnote 1: See Appendix IV.]

His first recorded speech was on the 6th of April, 1723, against the banishment of Dr. Francis
Atterbury, the Bishop of Rochester, which he deemed injudicious and needlessly rigorous.[1]

[Footnote 1: History and Proceedings of the House of Commons, Lond. 1742, Vol. VI. p. 308.]

A few years after, his feelings of humanity were powerfully touched on finding a gentleman,
whom he went to visit in the Fleet prison, loaded with irons, and otherwise cruelly used.[1]
Shocked by the scenes he witnessed, he determined to expose such injustice; and, if possible,
to prevent such abuse of power. With this view, he brought forward a motion in the House of
Commons, "that an inquiry should be instituted into the state of the gaols in the metropolis."
This met with such attention, that in February, 1728, the House of Commons assigned the subject
to a Committee, of which he was chosen Chairman.[2] The investigation led to the discovery
of many corrupt practices, and much oppressive treatment of the prisoners; and was followed
by the enactment of measures for the correction of such shameful mismanagement and inhuman
neglect in some cases, and for the prevention of severity of infliction in others.[3]

[Footnote 1: Sir William Rich, Baronet.]

[Footnote 2: Appendix IV.]

[Footnote 3: Appendix V.]

A writer, whose opinion was founded on the best means of knowledge, has declared that "the
effects of this interposition have been felt ever since by the unhappy prisoners."[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine for 1785, page 572.]

Oglethorpe thus became the precursor of HOWARD, the philanthropist, in the cause of humanity,
as it regards the amelioration of prison discipline in general, especially the rigors of close
confinement for debt or petty offences, and that among felons and convicts. The impression
then made on his mind and heart, led him, afterwards, to other and more extensive and efficacious
measures for the relief of poor debtors from the extortions and oppressions to which they were
subjected by gaolers, and from the humiliation and distress in which they were often involved
without any fault of their own, or by some conduct which deserved pity rather than punishment.

At the opening of the session of Parliament on the 12th of January, 1731, the King's speech
was the subject of debate in the House of Commons. A motion was made for an address of thanks,
in which they should declare their entire approbation of his Majesty's conduct, express their
confidence in the wisdom of his counsels, and announce their readiness to grant the necessary
supplies. There were some who opposed the motion. They did not argue against a general vote
of thanks, but intimated the impropriety, and, indeed, ill tendency of expressions which implied
an unquestioning approbation of the measures of the ministry.

[Footnote 1: History of England, Book II. chap. iv. Section xxx.]

The motion, however, was carried, and the address presented.

Possessing a vein of wit, Oglethorpe was apt to introduce piquant illustrations and comparisons
into his narratives, and sometimes with the view of their giving force to his statements; but,
though they might serve to enliven conversation, they were not dignified enough for a speech
in so august an assembly as that he was now addressing. They are, however, atoned for, on this
occasion, by the grave tenor of his preceding remarks, which were the dictates of good sense,
the suggestions of sound policy, and, especially, by the reference to the distressed situation
of the persecuted German Protestants which was evincive of a compassionate consideration, truly
honorable to him as a man and a Christian. And we shall find, that, in behalf of these, he
afterwards exerted a personal and availing influence.

In 1732 he made a spirited and patriotic effort in Parliament to restore a constitutional militia;
and to abolish arbitrary impressment for the sea-service; and, on this subject, he published
a pamphlet entitled "The Sailor's Advocate," for which Mr. Sharpe obliged him with a sarcastic
preface.

In the debate on the bill for encouraging the trade of the British sugar colonies, Oglethorpe
took an active part, and manifested those liberal and patriotic views, and that regard for
the colonial settlements in North America, which, afterwards, became with him a decided principle.

"In all cases," said he, "that come before this House, where there seems a clashing of interests,
we ought to have no exclusive regard to the particular interest of any one country or set of
people, but to the good of the whole. Our colonies are a part of our dominions. The people
in them are our own people; and we ought to show an equal respect to all. If it should appear
that our Plantations upon the continent of America are against that which is desired by the
sugar colonies, we are to presume that the granting thereof will be a prejudice to the trade
or particular interests of our continental settlements. And, surely, the danger of hurting
so considerable a part of our dominions,--a part which reaches from the 34th to the 46th degree
of north latitude,--will, at least, incline us to be extremely cautious in what we are going
about. If, therefore, it shall appear that the relieving our sugar colonies will do more harm
to the other parts of our dominions, than it can do good to them, we must refuse it, and think
of some other method of putting them upon an equal footing with their rivals in any part of trade.

"Our sugar colonies are of great consequence to us; but our other colonies in that part of
the world ought also to be considered. From them we have, likewise, yearly, large quantities
of goods. We ought not to raise one colony upon the destruction of another. Much less ought
we to grant a favor to any particular set of people which may prove to be against the public
good of the nation in general."

To these, and other matters of general moment, Oglethorpe devoted his time, his talents, and
his influence while in Parliament. He earnestly supported the cause of silk manufacture, which
had then begun to spread in England by means of the improvement introduced by Sir Thomas Lombe,
in the invention of his large engines, which are described as being of "a most curious and
intricate structure,"[1] but which in our own day, when mechanical ingenuity has reached a
high degree of excellence, and machinery seems itself almost an intelligent principle, would,
probably, be regarded as merely "curious and intricate," without possessing any practical value.[2]

[Footnote 1: The 6th of the excellent Essays by the Rev. Jared Eliot, on Field Husbandry, &
c., 1761, is devoted principally to recommendations of the culture of mulberry trees for the
raising of silk-worms. In page 161, is a reference to Sir Thomas Lombe, "that eminent throwster,
who erected the great engine in Derbyshire; a wonderful structure, consisting of twenty-nine
thousand five hundred and eighty-six wheels, all set a going and continued in motion by one
single water-wheel, for working silk with expedition and success." See also Appendix VII.]

[Footnote 2: Manuscript lecture of J. Willard, Esq.]

A Corporation was formed in London, in 1707, with the professed intention of lending money
to the poor on small pledges, and to persons of better rank, upon an answerable security, for
setting them up, or assisting them in business. Its capital was then limited to £30,000, but
in 1730 increased to £600,000, and a charter granted to the Corporation, by act of Parliament.
But in October 1731, two of the chief officers, George Robinson, Esq., member for Marlow, the
Cashier, and John Thompson, the Warehouse keeper, disappeared on the same day. This gave the
Proprietors great alarm; and an inspection of affairs led to the discovery that for a capital
of about £500,000, no equivalent was found to the value of £30,000; the remainder having been
disposed of by ways and means of which no one could give an account. In consequence of this
defalcation, a petition of the Proprietors was presented to the Parliament alleging that some
who had been guilty of these frauds had transported themselves to parts beyond the seas, and
carried with them some of the books and effects of the Corporation; and that there was great
reason to believe that such an immense sum of money could not have been embezzled without the
connivance and participation of others who remained in the kingdom; but that the petitioners
were unable to come at the knowledge of their combinations or to bring them to justice, unless
aided by the power and authority of that House; and therefore prayed that it might be afforded.

On the reading of the petition, Mr. Oglethorpe rose and spoke as follows:

"Sir, I am persuaded that this petition will be received in a manner befitting the unhappy
case of the sufferers and the justice of this House. I can hardly suspect that any gentleman
that has the honor of being a member of this House will hesitate in giving all the relief which
we can to the number of unfortunate persons, who have been so much injured. Yet, because I
have heard it whispered out of doors, that we ought not to receive this petition upon account,
as is pretended, that the common seal is not affixed to it, I deem it necessary to take some
notice of that objection, in case it should be started here. Sir, I must say that if there
be any irregularity as to the affixing the seal of the Company to this petition, it is, in
my opinion, so far from being an objection to our receiving the petition, that it is a very
strong reason for it. If there be any fault in form, it is the fault of those who had the keeping
of the common seal; and, as they may, perhaps, be of those against whom the complaints are
made, and who may, upon inquiry, be found more or less amenable for the wrong, we are, therefore,
to suspect that the withholding the seal may be with a view of preventing the truth's being
brought to light; at any rate, we ought to discountenance and defeat such indirect practices
with regard to the use of a common seal.

"For my own part, sir, I have been always for encouraging the design upon which this corporation
was at first established; and looked upon it as a provident act of charity to let necessitous
persons have the opportunity of borrowing money upon easier terms than they could have it elsewhere.
Money, like other things, is but a commodity, and in the way of dealing, the use of it is looked
upon to be worth as much as people can get for it. If this corporation let persons in limited
circumstances have the use of money at a cheaper rate than individuals, brokers, or money lenders,
would be willing to do, it was certainly a beneficent act. If they had demanded more than was
elsewhere given, they would not have had applicants, and the design would not have proved good
and useful; but the utility of it was most evident; and the better the design, and the more
excellent the benefit, the more those persons deserve to be punished, who by their frauds have
curtailed, if not now wholly cut off, these sources of furnishing assistance to the industrious
and enterprising, and disappointed the public of reaping the benefit which might have accrued
by an honest and faithful execution of so good an undertaking."[1]

[Footnote 1: History and Proceedings of the House of Commons, Vol. VII. p. 154.]

Another subject in the parliamentary discussions of Oglethorpe which I shall mention, is his
defence of the magistracy and town-guard of the city of Edinburgh against an arraignment in
the House of Lords, for what was deemed the neglect of prompt and energetic measures for suppressing
the riotous seizure and murder of Captain Porteous by an exasperated mob. The circumstances
were these.

After the execution in the Grass-market, on the 14th of April, 1736, of one Andrew Wilson,
a robber, the town-guard, which had been ordered out on the occasion, was insulted by rude
and threatening speeches, and pelted with stones, by the mob. John Porteous, the captain, so
resented the annoyance, that he commanded his men to fire over their heads, to intimidate them;
and then, as their opposition became violent, he directed the guard to fire among them; whereby
six persons were killed, and eleven severely wounded. For this he was prosecuted at the expense
of the city, and condemned to die. But, a short reprieve having been obtained, the mob, determined
to defeat it, assembled in the night preceding the seventh day of September, whereon he was
to have been executed pursuant to the sentence, and, in a very riotous manner, seized and disarmed
the city-guard, and possessed themselves of the town-gates, to prevent the admission of troops
quartered in the suburbs. They then rushed to the Tolbooth prison; the doors of which not yielding
to the force of their hammers, they consumed by fire, and then brought forth Porteous by violence,
and hung him on a dyer's post, or frame, in the Grass-market, nigh the spot where the unfortunate
people were killed.

The magistrates, attended with several of the burgesses, attempted to quell the riot and disperse
the mob, but were pelted with stones, and threatened to be fired upon if they did not retire.

This insult of the sovereign authority was too flagrant to be overlooked. Proclamations, with
rewards of two hundred pounds sterling, were issued for apprehending the rioters, and, when
the Parliament met, vigorous measures were taken in the affair. The Lord Provost was ordered
up to London in custody; the magistrates summoned to answer the indictment, and a bill was
introduced into the House of Commons "to disable Alexander Wilson, Esq., the principal magistrate
during the riots, from ever after holding any office of magistracy in Edinburgh or Great Britain;
to subject him to imprisonment for a year; to abolish the town guard, and to take away the
gates of the nether Bowport of the city." Oglethorpe objected to the first reading of the bill,
and it encountered his vigorous opposition. He engaged in a warm defence of the magistrates,
and of the guard, declaring that there was no dereliction of duty on the part of the magistrates
and of the guard, but they were overpowered by numbers, and thrown into actual jeopardy by
the desperation of the mob. Hence the penalties of the bill would be the punishment of misfortune,
not of crime.

In consequence of the stand which he thus took, and the interest made by others in the House
of Commons, the bill was altered in its most essential circumstances, and, instead of the rigorous
inflictions, "mercy rejoiced against judgment," and the city was fined the sum of two thousand
pounds, to be applied to the relief and support of the widow of Porteous.[1]

[Footnote 1: See Appendix VIII.]

A petition was made to Parliament "to extend the benefit of a late act for naturalizing foreigners
in North America, to the Moravian Brethren and other foreign Protestants who made a scruple
of taking an oath, or performing military service." General Oglethorpe, in the spring of 1737,
presented the petition to the House of Commons, with an ample speech, and was supported by
many members. The opinion of the Board of Trade was required on this head. The Proprietor of
Pennsylvania promoted the affair among the members of Parliament, and especially with the Secretary
of State, the Duke of Newcastle, by his good testimonies of the brethren in Pennsylvania. The
matter of the bill was properly discussed, formed into an act, and, having passed, with the
greatest satisfaction, through both houses, received in June, 1747, the Royal assent.[1]

[Footnote 1: Cranz's History of the United Brethren, translated by La Trobe, Lond. 1780, p. 331.]

On the 20th of February, 1749, another petition in behalf of the Moravians was presented to
the House of Commons; and was supported by a long and highly impressive speech by Oglethorpe
concerning the origin of their church, their constitution, their pious and benevolent labors,
and particularly, what he was most apprized of, their peaceable and useful settlements in America.
On the 18th of April, the engrossed bill was read the third time in the House, was passed,
nemine contradicente, and ordered to be carried to the House of Lords. On the 21st of April,
the bill was carried by sixteen members of the House of Commons to the House of Lords; and,
after a short address by Oglethorpe, their leader, to Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, was accepted
with great solemnity, and laid on the table. After due consideration, the act was passed, and
on the 6th of June the Royal assent was given to it.

In January, 1731, Oglethorpe was chosen a Director of the Royal African Company, and the next
year Deputy Governor. This situation brought to his knowledge the circumstances of an African
slave, whose story is so interesting, that a few pages may be allowed for its recital.

A negro, called JOB, was purchased on the coast of Africa by Captain Pyke, commander of a vessel
belonging to Mr. Hunt, a rich merchant of Liverpool, and carried to Annapolis, Maryland, where,
with others, he was delivered to Michael Denton, the factor of Hunt, who sold him to Mr. Tolsey.
He was at first employed in the cultivation of tobacco; but his humane master perceiving that
he could not bear the fatigue, rendered his situation more tolerable by charging him with the
care of his cattle. While in this employment, he used to retire, at stated times, to the recesses
of a wood, to pray. He was seen there by a white boy, who amused himself with interrupting
him, and often with wantonly insulting him by throwing dust in his eyes. This greatly added
to Job's melancholy, which was increased by his having no means of making known the annoyance
and abuse to which he was subjected, so that he grew desperate, and made his escape. He travelled
through the woods till he came to the county of Kent, on Delaware bay, in Maryland, where,
having no pass, and not being able to give any account of himself, he was taken up as a fugitive
slave, and put into prison. While there, his behavior attracted more than common notice. Besides
a stateliness of bearing, and an air of self-importance, which shew that he could be no ordinary
person, he was observed to use prostrations at regular periods of the day, and to repeat sentences
with great solemnity and earnestness. Curiosity attracted to the prison certain English merchants,
among whom Mr. Thomas Bluet was the most inquisitive. He was able, from an old negro, who was
a Foulah,[1] and understood the language of Job, to obtain some information respecting his
former condition and character. These particulars were communicated to his master Tolsey, who
had been apprized of his capture, and come to reclaim him. In consideration, therefore, of
what he had been, he not only forebore inflicting punishment on him for desertion, but treated
him with great indulgence. Having ascertained that Job had in his possession certain slips
of a kind of paper, on which he wrote strange characters, he furnished him with some sheets
of paper, and signified a wish that he should use it. Job profited of his kindness, to write
a letter to his father. This was committed to Denton, to entrust to his captain on the first
voyage which he should make to Africa; but he having sailed for England, it was sent enclosed
to Mr. Hunt, at London. When it arrived there, Captain Pyke was on his voyage to Africa. Here,
however, it was shewn to the Governor of the Royal African Company, and thus it "fell into
the hands," says my author, "of the celebrated Oglethorpe,[2] who sent it to the University
of Oxford to be translated, as it was discovered to be written in Arabic." The information
which it imparted of the disastrous fate of the writer, so awakened his compassion, that he
engaged Mr. Hunt, by an obligation to refund all expenses, to have Job redeemed, and brought
to England. This was immediately attended to, and he was sent in the William, commanded by
captain Wright, and in the same vessel was Mr. Bluet, who became so attached to him, that,
on their landing, he went with him to London, where they arrived in April, 1733. As he did
not find Oglethorpe, who had gone to Georgia, Bluet took him to his own house at Cheshunt,
in Hertfordshire. There Job recommended himself by his manly and courteous behavior; and applied
himself so diligently to learn the English language, that he was soon able to speak, and even
write it with correctness.

[Footnote 1: In the relation which I follow this appellation is written Pholey.]

[Footnote 2: BLUET.]

In the mean time a letter was sent in his behalf by Oglethorpe to the African Company, requesting
them to take up his obligation to Mr. Hunt, and to pay the expenses of his voyage and accommodation
after his arrival; and to answer the bills of Mr. Bluet for his keeping and instruction, till
he himself should return. This was readily done, and his emancipation effected for forty pounds;
and twenty pounds, bond and charges, were raised by subscription.

Job's knowledge of Arabic rendered him serviceable to Sir Hans Sloane, who often employed him
in translating Arabic manuscripts, and inscriptions upon medals. To bring him into due notice,
Sir Hans had him dressed in the costume of his country, and presented to the king and royal
family; by whom he was graciously received; and her majesty gave him a beautiful gold watch.
The same day he dined with the Duke of Montague; who afterwards took him to his country seat,
where he was shewn, and taught the use of, the tools employed in agriculture and gardening.
The same nobleman procured for him a great number of these implements, which were put into
cases, and carried aboard the vessel in which he was to return to his native country. He received
various other presents from many persons; some of these, according to Mr. Moore, were their
Royal Highnesses, the Earl of Pembroke, several ladies of distinction, Mr. Holden, and members
of the Royal African Company.

In the reference to him in NICHOLS'S Literary Anecdotes, vi. p. 91, it is said "he returned
home loaded with presents to the amount of five hundred pounds." After having passed fourteen
months in England, he embarked, in the month of July, 1734, on board a vessel belonging to
the Royal African Company, which was bound for the river Gambia, and carried out Thomas Moore
to accomplish some business at a Factory of the Company's at Joar, to whose particular care
Job was committed.

While in England, his friend Bluet, collected from Job the history of his life, which he published,[1]
and from which some of the preceding, and several of the following particulars are extracted.

[Footnote 1: Memoirs of the Life of Job, the son of Solomon, the High Priest of Bimda, in Africa.
By Thomas Bluet. London, 1734; 8vo., dedicated to the Duke of Montague.]

The name of this extraordinary man was Ayoub Ibn Soliman Ibrahim, that is, Job the son of Solomon
the son of Abraham. His nation was that of the Jalofs; his tribe, or cast, the Pholey, or Foulah;
and his native place Bunda, a city of Galumbo, in the kingdom of Futa, in Central Africa, opposite
Tombuto.[1]

[Footnote 1: The affix to his name is sometimes spelt JALLA, JALOF, and DGIALLA. These indicate
the name of the tribe, or nation, to which he belonged; which was that of the JALOFS, on the
river Sanaga, and along the Gambia.]

Ibrahim, the grandfather of Job, was the founder of the city of Bunda, during the reign of
Abubeker, then king of Futa; who gave him the proprietorship and government of it, with the
title of Alfa or High Priest. After his death, the dignity, which was hereditary in the family,
passed to the father of Job. On the decease of Abubeker, his brother, the Prince of Jelazi,
succeeded to the royalty; he, being already the father of a son, entrusted him to the care
of Soliman, the father of Job, to have him taught the Arabic language, and the Alcoran. Job
became, in this way, the fellow student and companion of this young prince. Jelazi lived but
a short time, and was succeeded by his son.

When Job had attained the age of fifteen, he assisted his father in the capacity of Iman, or
inferior priest, and soon after married the daughter of the Alfa of Tombuto: By her he had
three sons, Abdallah, Ibrahim, and Sambo. Two years before his captivity he took a second wife,
the daughter of the Alfa of Tomga; by whom he had a daughter named Fatima. His two wives and
his four children were alive when he left Bunda.

In the month of February, 1730, the father of Job, having learnt that an English vessel had
arrived in the Gambia, sent his son thither, attended by two domestics, to procure some European
commodities; but charged him not to cross the river, because the inhabitants of the opposite
bank were Mandingoes, enemies of the kingdom of Futa.

Job, coming to no agreement with Captain Pyke, the commander of the English vessel, sent back
his two domestics to Bunda, to render an account of his affairs to his father, and to inform
him that his curiosity induced him to travel further. With this view he made a contract with
a negro merchant, named Loumein-Yoa, who understood the language of the Mandingoes, to serve
him as an interpreter and guide on a pacific expedition and overture. Having passed the river
Gambia, when the heat compelled him to avail himself of the cooling shade of the forest, he
suspended his arms upon a tree, to rest himself. They consisted of a sabre, with a handle of
gold; a dagger in a sheath, with a hilt of the same metal, and a rich quiver filled with arrows,
of which king Sambo, the son of Jelazi, had made him a present. "His evil destiny willed"[1]
that a troop of Mandingoes, accustomed to pillage, should pass that way, who, discovering him
unarmed, seized him, shaved his head and chin; and, on the 27th of February, sold him, with
his interpreter, to Captain Pyke; and, on the first of March, they were put on board the vessel.
Pyke, however, learning from Job that he was the same person who had attempted to trade with
him some days before, and that he was a slave only by having been kidnapped, gave him leave
to ransom himself and his companion. Accordingly, Job immediately sent to a friend of his father,
who dwelt at Joar, where the vessel then lay, to beseech him to send news of his captivity.
But the distance being fifteen days journey, the Captain, after waiting some time, found it
necessary to set sail, and the unfortunate Job was carried off, and sold, as has been already
mentioned.

[Footnote 1: This is the explanation of Job, who being a Mahometan, was a fatalist in his belief.]

He is described as being a fine figure, five feet ten inches in height; of a pleasing but grave
countenance, and having strait black hair.[1] His natural qualities were excellent. He was
possessed of a solid judgment, a ready and wonderfully retentive memory, an ardent love for
truth, and a sweet disposition, mild, affectionate, and grateful. His religion was Mahometanism;
but he rejected the idea of a sensual paradise, and several other traditions that are held
among the Turks. The foundation of his principles was the unity of God; whose name he never
pronounced without some particular indication of respect. "The ideas which he held of the Supreme
Being and of a future state, appeared very reasonable to the English; but he was so firm in
the persuasion of the divine unity, that it was impossible to get him to reason calmly upon
the doctrine of the Trinity. A New Testament in Arabic had been given him. He read it; and,
giving his ideas, respectfully, concerning it, began by declaring that having examined it carefully,
he could not find a word from which he could conclude that there were three Gods."[2]

[Footnote 1: There is a scarce octavo portrait of him, head and shoulders only, etched by the
celebrated painter, Mr. Hoare, of Bath, in 1734, as appears by a manuscript note on the impression
of it in Mr. Bindley's possession. Under the print is engraved, "JOB, son of Solliman Dgialla,
high priest of Bonda, in the country of Foota, Africa."]

[Footnote 2: "Il etoit si ferme dans la persuasion de l'unité divine, qu'il fut impossible
de le faire raisouner paisiblement sur la Trinité. On lui avoit donué un Nouveau Testament
daus sa langue, il le lut, et s'expliquant, avec respect, sur ce livre, il commence par déclarer
que l'ayant examiné fort soigneusement, il n'y avoit pas trouvé un mot d'ou l'on fuit conclure
qu'il y eut trois dieux." Histoire générale des Voyages, par l'Abbé A.F. Prévost. 4to. Paris.
1747. Tom. III. p. 116.]

Job landed at Fort English on the 8th of August, 1734. He was recommended particularly by the
Directors of the Royal African Company to the Governor and Factors. They treated him with much
respect and civility. The hope of finding one of his countrymen at Joar, induced him to set
out on the 23d in the shallop with Mr. Moore, who was going to take the direction of the factory
there. On the 26th at evening they arrived at the creek of Damasensa. Whilst Job was seated
under a tree with the English, he saw seven or eight negroes pass of the nation that had made
him a slave, thirty miles from that place. Though he was of a mild disposition, he could hardly
refrain from attacking them with his sabre and pistols; but Moore made him give up all thought
of this, by representing to him the imprudence and danger of such a measure. They called the
negroes to them, to ask them various questions, and to inquire particularly what had become
of the king, their master. They answered that he had lost his life by the discharge of a pistol,
which he ordinarily carried suspended to his neck, and which, going off by accident, had killed
him on the spot. As this pistol was supposed to have been one of the articles which he had
received of Captain Pyke as the price of Job, the now redeemed captive, deeply affected by
the circumstance, turning to his conductors, said, "You see that Heaven has made the very arms
for which I was sold, serve as the punishment of the inexorable wretch who made my freedom
their procurement! And yet I ought to be thankful for the lot into which I was cast, because
if I had not been made a captive, I should not have seen such a country as England; nor known
the language; nor have the many useful and precious things that I possess; nor become acquainted
with men so generous as I have met with, not only to redeem me from bondage, but to shew me
great kindness, and send me back so much more capable of being useful." Indeed, he did not
cease to praise highly the English in conversing with the Africans, and endeavored to reclaim
those poor creatures from the prejudice they had that the slaves were eaten, or killed for
some other purpose, because no one was known to have returned.

Having met with a Foulah, with whom he had been formerly acquainted, he engaged him to notify
his family of his return; but four months elapsed before he received any intelligence from
Bunda. On the 14th of January, 1735, the messenger came back, bearing the sad tidings that
his father had died; with the consolation, however, of learning, just before his death, of
the ransom of his son, and of the favor which he had received in England. One of the wives
of Job had married again in his absence; and the second husband had fled on being informed
of the arrival of the first. During the last three years, the war had made such ravages in
the country of Bunda, that no cattle remained there.

Job was deeply affected with the death of his father, the misfortunes of his country, and the
situation of his family. He protested, however, that he pardoned his wife, and the man who
had espoused her. "They had reason," he said, "to suppose me lost to them forever, because
I had gone to a country from which no Foulah had ever returned."

When Moore, from whose narrative these particulars are extracted, left Africa, he was charged
with letters from Job, who remained at Joar, to Oglethorpe, Bluet, the Duke of Montague, his
principal benefactors, and to the Royal African Company.[1]

a Pholey, who was in England in 1733, and known by the name of "the African Prince." By FRANCIS
MOORE. London, 1738.]

"On Thursday, November 4th, 1737, Sir Hans Sloane communicated to the Royal Society a letter
which a gentleman had received from Job, the African, whom MR. OGLETHORPE released from slavery,
and the African Company sent home to his own country, in one of their ships, about twelve months
ago. In this letter he very gratefully acknowledges the favor he received in England; and,
in answer to some things desired of him when here, says that he has been in the country where
the tree producing the gum-Arabic grows, and can assist the English in that trade. He further
says, that he has been up in the country, as far as the mountains from whence the gold-dust
is wafted down; and that if the English would build flat-bottomed boats to go up the river,
and send persons well skilled in separating the gold from the ore, they might gain vastly more
than at present they do by the dust trade; and that he should be always ready and willing to
use the utmost of his power, (which is very considerable in that country,) to encourage and
support them therein."[1]

[Footnote 1: Political State of Great Britain, Vol. LIII. p. 18.]

Mr. Nichols, who has inserted his name among the members of the Gentleman's Society at Spalding,
adds, "died 1773."[1]

[Footnote 1: Literary Anecdotes, Vol. VI. p. 90.]

CHAPTER III.

The project, which had been for some time in contemplation, of settling the south-eastern frontier
of Carolina, between the rivers Savannah and Alatamaha,[1] suggested to Oglethorpe that it
could be effected by procuring the liberation of insolvent debtors, and uniting with them such
other persons in reduced circumstances as might be collected elsewhere, and inducing them to
emigrate thither and form a settlement.

[Footnote 1: See A Discourse concerning the designed establishment of a new Colony to the south
of Carolina, by Sir ROBERT MONTGOMERY, Baronet. London, 1717.]

As such a project and design required for its furtherance more means than an individual could
furnish, and more managing and directing power than, unaided, he himself could exert, Oglethorpe
sought the coöperation of wealthy and influential persons in the beneficent enterprise. Concurring
with his views, twenty-one associates petitioned the throne for an act of incorporation, and
obtained letters-patent, bearing date the 9th of June, 1732; the preamble of which recited,
among other things, that "many of his Majesty's poor subjects were, through misfortunes and
want of employment, reduced to great necessities, and would be glad to be settled in any of
his provinces of America, where, by cultivating the waste and desolate lands, they might not
only gain a comfortable subsistence, but also strengthen the colonies, and increase the trade,
navigation, and wealth of his Majesty's realms." And then added, that, for the considerations
aforesaid, the King did constitute and appoint certain persons, whose names are given, "trustees
for settling and establishing the colony of Georgia in America," the intended new province
being so called in honor of the King, who encouraged readily the benevolent project, and contributed
largely to its furtherance.

At the desire of these gentlemen, there were inserted clauses in the charter, restraining them
and their successors from receiving any salary, fee, perquisite, or profit, whatsoever, by
or from this undertaking; and also from receiving any grant of lands within the said district
to themselves, or in trust for them.[1]

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. IX.]

"No colony," says Southey, "was ever established upon principles more honorable to its projectors.
The conduct of the trustees did not discredit their profession. They looked for no emolument
to themselves or their representatives after them."[1]

[Footnote 1: SOUTHEY'S Life of Wesley, Vol. I. p. 179.]

In pursuance of the requisitions of the charter, the trustees held a meeting in London, about
the middle of July, for the choice of officers, and the drawing up of rules for the transaction
of business. They adopted a seal for the authentication of such official papers as they should
issue. This inscription announced the beneficent disposition and disinterested motives of the
trustees; while the device was an allusion to a special object which they had in view,--the
production of silk.

They had learned that the climate of the region was particularly favorable to the breeding
of the worms, and that the mulberry-tree was indigenous there. They conceived that the attention
requisite, during the few weeks of the feeding of the worms, might be paid by the women and
children, the old and infirm, without taking off the active men from their employment, or calling
in the laborers from their work. For encouragement and assistance in the undertaking, they
were willing to engage persons from Italy, acquainted with the method of feeding the worms
and winding the thread from the cocoons, to go over with the settlers, and instruct them in
the whole process. And they intended to recommend it strongly to the emigrants to use their
utmost skill and diligence in the culture of mulberry trees, and the prompt attention to the
purpose to which their leaves were to be applied; so that, in due time the nation might receive
such remittances of raw silk as would evince that their liberality towards effecting the settlement
was well applied, and available in produce of an article of importation of so valuable a nature,
and in great demand.

The trustees were excited to this project by Oglethorpe, who had been deeply engaged in ascertaining
the value of wrought silk as an article of commerce, and also of the raw silk for domestic
manufacture, at the time when Mr. John Lombe's invention for winding and reeling had been brought
before Parliament. And now he considered that it would be an exceedingly desirable project
to introduce the raising of the commodity in the projected new settlement, and thus diminish
to the nation the large sums annually expended in the importation.

This is one of those prospective measures for the advancement of the colony, which were nearly
a century before the age.[1] Others will hereafter be mentioned alike entitled to wonder and
admiration.

[Footnote 1: See in the Appendix to this volume, a brief history of the culture of silk in
Georgia.]

In order to fulfil the intent and promote the purposes of their incorporation, the trustees
gave public notice that they were ready to receive applications from such as were disposed
to emigrate. They also appointed a committee to visit the prisons, and make a list of insolvent
debtors for whom a discharge from the demands of their creditors could be obtained, and to
ascertain what compromise might be effected for their release;[1] as also to inquire into the
circumstances and character of applicants. To render these more willing to emigrate, it became
necessary to hold out encouragement and to offer outfits. To defray these and meet subsequent
expenses in carrying the enterprize into effect, they first set the example of contribution
themselves, and then undertook to solicit benefactions from others. Several individuals subscribed
liberally; collections were made throughout the kingdom; the directors of the Bank of England
volunteered a handsome contribution; and the Parliament gave ten thousand pounds.

[Footnote 1: "That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth! to them that are in darkness,
Show yourselves! They shall feed in the ways. They shall no longer hunger or thirst; FOR HE
THAT HATH MERCY ON THEM SHALL LEAD THEM, even by the springs of water shall he guide them,
with those that come from far."--Isaiah xlix. 9,11.]

Having thus acquired a fund to be laid out in clothing, arming, sending over, and supporting
the emigrants, and for supplying them with necessary implements to commence and carry on the
settlement, the following statement was published: "There are many poor, unfortunate persons
in this country, who would willingly labor for their bread, if they could find employment and
get bread for laboring. Such persons may be provided for by being sent to a country where there
are vast tracts of fertile land lying uninhabited and uncultivated. They will be taken care
of on their passage; they will get lands on which to employ their industry; they will be furnished
with sufficient tools for setting their industry to work; and they will be provided with a
certain support, till the fruits of their industry can come in to supply their wants; and all
this without subjecting themselves to any master, or submitting to any slavery. The fruits
of every man's own industry are to be his own. Every man who transports himself thither is
to enjoy all the privileges of a free-born subject."[1]

[Footnote 1: Political state of Great Britain, for August, 1732, Vol. XLIV. p. 150.]

Oglethorpe himself stated the object, the motive, and the inducements of such an emigration
in the following terms. "They who can make life tolerable here, are willing to stay at home,
as it is indeed best for the kingdom that they should. But they who are oppressed with poverty
and misfortunes, are unable to be at the charges of removing from their miseries, and these
are the persons intended to be relieved. And let us cast our eyes on the multitude of unfortunate
individuals in the kingdom, of reputable families, and of liberal, or at least easy education,
some undone by guardians, some by lawsuits, some by accidents in commerce, some by stocks and
bubbles, and some by suretyship; but all agree in this one circumstance, that they must either
be burdensome to their relations, or betake themselves to little shifts for sustenance, which,
it is ten to one do not answer their purposes, and to which a well-educated person descends
with the utmost constraint. What various misfortunes may reduce the rich, the industrious,
to danger of a prison,--to a moral certainty of starving!--These are the persons that may relieve
themselves, and strengthen Georgia by resorting thither, and Great Britain by their departure.

"With a view to the relief of people in the condition I have described, his Majesty has, this
present year, incorporated a considerable number of persons of quality and distinction, and
invested a large tract of South Carolina in them, by the name of Georgia, in trust, to be distributed
among the necessitous. London. 1733. p. 30--33.]

When the Trustees had got a list of a sufficient number of persons disposed to emigrate, they
resolved to send them over.

A vessel was hired to convey the emigrants, fitted up for their accommodation, and supplied
with stores, not only for the voyage, but for their support after their arrival. The Trustees
also furnished tools for building, implements for husbandry, domestic utensils, and various
other articles; and JAMES OGLETHORPE, Esq., one of the Trustees, and the most zealous and active
promoter of the enterprise, having signified his readiness to go with the emigrants, and in
the same ship, in order to see that they were well treated, and to take care of them after
their landing, was clothed with power to exercise the functions of Governor of the Colony.[1]

[Footnote 1: Account, shewing the progress of the Colony of Georgia from its first settlement;
published by order of the Honorable Trustees, by Benjamin Martin, Secretary. London. 1741.]

He was prompted to engage in this undertaking by the spirit of enterprise and an enlarged philanthropy
and patriotism. While the benevolent purpose called into exercise his noblest feelings, he
considered that the settlement of a new colony, in a pleasant region, would not only raise
the character and highly improve the condition of those by whom it was constituted, but contribute
to the interests of the British empire.

In all this he was actuated by motives wholly disinterested; for he freely devoted his time,
his exertions, and his influence to the enterprise; and not only bore his own expenses, but
contributed largely to the means and assistance of others.[1]

[Footnote 1: See Appendix, No. X.]

The Abbe Raynal, in his Philosophical and Political History of the British Settlements in America,[1]
states as the cause of Oglethorpe's undertaking, what, when rightly understood, was but a consequence
of it. He says, "A rich and humane citizen, at his death, left the whole of his estate to set
at liberty such insolvent debtors as were detained in prison by their creditors. Prudential
reasons of policy concurred in the performance of this Will, dictated by humanity; and the
Government gave orders that such unhappy prisoners as were released should be transported into
Georgia. The Parliament added nine thousand eight hundred and forty-three pounds fifteen shillings,
to the estate left by the Will of the citizen. A voluntary subscription produced a much more
considerable sum. General Oglethorpe, a man who had distinguished himself by his taste for
great designs, by his zeal for his country, and his passion for glory, was fixed upon to direct
these public finances, and to carry into execution so excellent a project."

[Footnote 1: Book II. Chap. IV. See also his History of the Settlements and Trade of the East
and West Indies, by Europeans, Book XVIII. Vol. VII. page 359, of the English translation.
Lond. 1787.]

Mr. Warden, adopted this account, but varied a little from it; for he says, "It happened that
Oglethorpe was named executor for the disposal of a legacy left by a wealthy Englishman for
the deliverance of insolvent debtors, detained in prison; and this donation, with others, procured
from generous individuals, and ten thousand pounds sterling advanced by the government, was
employed for the establishment of a colony, where this unfortunate class of men might find
an asylum."[1]

[Footnote 1: Statistical, Political, and Historical Account of the United States of America.
Vol. II. p. 471.]

Mr. Graham has also followed this statement, and given the testator the credit of projecting
the release of prisoners for debt; a project which originated solely with Oglethorpe.[1]

[Footnote 1: History of America. Vol. III p. 180.]

I have sought in vain for early vouchers of this statement, and feel assured that the project
did not grow out of a bequest either of a "whole estate," or a "legacy" of any amount, left
by "a rich citizen," or "a wealthy subject" of Great Britain. The story, like most others,
becoming amplified by repetition, arose from the fact that Edward Adderly, Esq. had given,
in his Will, the sum of one hundred pounds in aid of the settlement of Georgia; but that was
two years after the settlement had commenced; and it was not to Oglethorpe individually to
manage, but to the Trustees to appropriate.

Among my authorities are the publications of the day, when facts and circumstances are mentioned
as taking place, and may, therefore, be relied on. I dwell on them more particularly, and lay
on them greater stress, because all the early narratives speak of Oglethorpe as the projector
of the undertaking, the leader of the emigrants, the founder of the colony. The publisher of
"An account of the first planting of the colony of Georgia,"[1] speaking of his engagedness
in this noble cause, says, "This was an instance of generosity and public spirit, and an enterprise
of fatigue as Well as of danger, which few ages or nations can boast."

[Footnote 1: Account of the first planting of the colony of Georgia; published from the records
of the Trustees; by BENJAMIN MARTIN, their Secretary. Lond. 1741, p. 11.]

Ambition and enterprise were strong traits in his character; and what he devised, his firmness
of constitution, vigor of health, force of principle, and untiring perseverance, enabled him
to pursue to its accomplishment.

On the 16th of November, 1732, the intended emigrants embarked, accompanied by the Reverend
Henry Herbert, D.D., a clergyman of the Church of England, as Chaplain, and Mr. Amatis, from
Piedmont, who was engaged to instruct them in raising silk-worms, and the art of winding silk.
The, following "account of their setting forth," is taken from a contemporary publication.

"The Ann galley, of about two hundred tons, is on the point of sailing from Depford, for the
new Colony of Georgia, with thirty-five families, consisting of carpenters, brick-layers, farmers,
&c., who take all proper instruments for their employment on their arrival. The men are learning
military discipline of the guards; and are furnished with muskets, bayonets, and swords, to
defend the colony in case of an attack from the Indians. The vessel has on board ten tons of
Alderman Parsons's best beer, and will take in at Madeira five tons of wine for the service
of the colony. Many of the Trustees were on board for the purpose of ascertaining whether they
were suitably accommodated and provided for; and to take leave of the worthy gentleman of their
own body, who goes with them to take care of them, and to direct in laying out their lands,
and forming a town."[1]

[Footnote 1: GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE for 1732, p. 1029.]

In pursuance of the benevolent design of the Trustees, Oglethorpe engaged in this expedition
entirely at his own expense; furnished his own cabin-fare, on board; and was constantly attentive,
during the whole voyage, to the situation and comfort of the passengers.

On the 13th of January, 1733, the ship dropt anchor outside of the bar, at the port of Charlestown,
South Carolina. Excepting that two infirm children died on the passage, all that went on board
had been well, and arrived in good health.[1]

[Footnote 1: The following details are taken from what appears to be information sent to the
Trustees in London, and by them published in that popular Journal entitled "The Political State
of Great Britain," Vol. XLVI. page 234, collated with The History of the Rise, Progress, and
Present State of the Colony of Georgia, in HARRIS'S Collection of Voyages, II. 327.]

Oglethorpe, with his suite, went on shore to wait on the Governor of the Province, his Excellency
Robert Johnson. He was received in the kindest manner, and treated by him and the Council with
every mark of civility and respect. Sensible of the great advantage that must accrue to Carolina
from this new colony, the Governor afforded all the assistance in his power to forward the
settlement; and immediately sent an order to Mr. Middleton, the king's pilot, to conduct the
ship into Port Royal, and to furnish small craft to convey the colonists thence to the river
Savannah.

In about ten hours they proceeded with this naval escort. On the 18th Mr. Oglethorpe went ashore
on Tench's Island, where he left eight men, with directions to prepare huts for the people
who would disembark, and tarry there till he could make farther arrangements. He proceeded
thence to Beaufort, a frontier town of South Carolina, situated on Port Royal Island, at the
mouth of the Coosawatchie river, having an excellent harbor.

Early the next morning he went ashore, and was saluted by a discharge of the artillery. The
Colonists, arriving on the 20th, were cheerfully received and assisted by Lieutenant Watts,
Ensign Farrington, and other officers of the King's Independent Company on that station; and
were waited upon and welcomed by Mr. Delabarr and gentlemen of the neighborhood.[1]

[Footnote 1: "Brief Account of the Progress of the First Colony sent to Georgia,"--inserted
in the 46th volume, p. 234, of the "Political State of Great Britain;" and it makes the second
Tract in FORCE'S Collection.]

While the sea-worn emigrants rested and refreshed themselves, the indefatigable Oglethorpe,
accompanied by Colonel William Bull, a man of knowledge and experience, went up the river to
explore the country. Having found a pleasant spot of ground near to Yamacraw, they fixed upon
the place as the most convenient and healthy situation for the settlers, and there marked out
a town, which, from the Indian name of the river that ran past it, they called Savannah.

On the 24th he returned, and with the emigrants celebrated the following Sunday as a day of
Thanksgiving for their safe arrival. A sermon was preached by the Reverend Mr. Jones,[1] by
exchange of services with Doctor Herbert, who officiated at Beaufort. There was a great resort
of gentlemen and their families, from the neighborhood, to welcome the new-comers, and unite
with them in the gladness of the occasion.

[Footnote 1: REV LEWIS JONES. See some account of him in DALCHO'S History of the Protestant
Episcopal Church in South Carolina, p. 378.]

On the 31st they arrived at the place selected for their settlement, the description of which
by Oglethorpe himself, in a letter to the Trustees, dated the 10th of February, 1733, cannot
fail to give both interesting information and much pleasure to the reader.

After referring to a former letter, and giving a brief notice of their arrival at Beaufort,
and his selection of a site, a few miles higher up the river, for laying out a town, he adds,
"The river here forms a half-moon, along side of which the banks are about forty feet high,
and on the top is a flat, which they call 'a bluff.' The plain high ground extends into the
country about five or six miles; and, along the river side, about a mile. Ships that draw twelve
feet of water can ride within ten yards of the bank. Upon the river side, in the centre of
this plain, I have laid out the town, opposite to which is an island of very rich pasturage,
which I think should be kept for the cattle of the Trustees. The river is pretty wide, the
water fresh, and from the key of the town you see its whole course to the sea, with the island
of Tybee, which is at its mouth. For about six miles up into the country, the landscape is
very agreeable, the stream being wide, and bordered with high woods on both sides.

"The whole people arrived here on the first of February. At night their tents were got up.
Until the tenth they were taken up with unloading and making a crane, which I then could not
finish, and so took off the hands, and set some to the fortification, and began to fell the woods.

"I have marked out the town and common; half of the former is already cleared; and the first
house was begun yesterday in the afternoon.

"I have taken ten of the Independent Company to work for us, for which I make them an allowance.

"I send you a copy of the resolution of the Assembly of Carolina, and the Governor and Council's
letter to me.[1]

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. X.]

"Mr. Whitaker has given us one hundred head of cattle. Colonel Bull, Mr. Barlow, Mr. St. Julian,
and Mr. Woodward are come up to assist us, with some of their servants.

"I am so taken up in looking after a hundred necessary things, that I write now short, but
shall give you a more particular account hereafter.

"A little Indian nation, the only one within fifty miles, is not only in amity, but desirous
to be subjects to his Majesty King George, to have lands given them among us. Their chief,
and his beloved man, who is the second in the nation, desire to be instructed in the Christian
religion."[1]

[Footnote 1: "The beloved man is a person of much consequence. He maintains and exercises great
influence in the state, particularly in military affairs, their Senate, or Council, never determining
an expedition or treaty without his consent and assistance." BOUDINOT, Star in the East, p. 202.]

Realizing how important it was to obtain the consent of the natural proprietors of the region,
to the settlement of his colony here, and how desirable to be on good terms with those in the
vicinity, he sought for an interview with Tomo Chichi, the Mico, or chief of a small tribe
who resided at a place called Yamacraw, three miles up the river. Most fortunately and opportunely,
he met with an Indian woman who had married a Carolinian trader by the name of Musgrove; and
who understood and could speak the English language; and he availed himself of her assistance
as an interpreter.[1] The conference ended in a compact and treaty, favorable to the new comers.
From this venerable chieftain he afterwards learned, that, besides that immediate district,
the territory was claimed and partly occupied by the tribes of the upper and lower Creeks,
whose formidable power, no less than their distinct pretensions, rendered it important that
their consent should also be obtained. Accordingly, to gain their favor and sanction, he engaged
Tomo Chichi to despatch an invitation to their chiefs, to hold a conference with him at Savannah.

[Footnote 1: Oglethorpe afterwards allowed her an annual stipend for her services, finding
that she had great influence with the Indians.--Some years afterwards she married the Reverend
Mr. Bosomworth; and then she put on airs, and united with him in a vexatious claim for a large
tract of land. See McCALL, Vol. I. p. 213. Bosomworth had been a Chaplain in the Regiment of
the General; had received many favors from him personally; and a salary from the Society for
propagating the Gospel in Foreign parts.]

A letter from Oglethorpe, dated Savannah March 12th, 1732-3, gives the following additional
information.

"This Province is much larger than we thought, being one hundred and twenty miles from this
river to the Alatamaha. This river has a very long course, and a great trade is carried on
by it to the Indians, there having above twelve trading boats passed since I have been here.

"There are in Georgia, on this side the mountains, three considerable nations of Indians; one
called the Lower Creeks, consisting of nine towns, or rather cantons, making about one thousand
men able to bear arms. One of these is within a short distance from us, and has concluded a
peace with us, giving up their right to all this part of the country; and I have marked out
the lands which they have reserved to themselves. The King comes constantly to church, and
is desirous to be instructed in the Christian religion; and has given me his nephew, a boy,
who is his next heir, to educate.

"The two other nations are the Uchees and the Upper Creeks; the first consisting of two hundred,
the latter of eleven hundred men. We agree so well with the Indians, that the Creeks and Uchees
have referred to me a difference to determine, which otherwise would have occasioned a war.

"Our people still lie in tents, there being only two clapboard houses built, and three sawed
houses framed. Our crane, our battery of cannon, and magazine are finished. This is all that
we have been able to do, by reason of the smallness of our number, of which many have been
sick, and others unused to labor; though, I thank God, they are now pretty well, and we have
not lost one since our arrival here."[1]

[Footnote 1: Political Taste of Great Britain, Vol. XLV. p. 445.]

The following extract from a letter dated Charlestown, 22d March, 1732-3, and printed in the
South Carolina Gazette, describes, in honorable terms, the attention which the leader of this
enterprise devoted to its furtherance.[1]

[Footnote 1: See also "Account showing the progress of the Colony of Georgia from its first
Establishment." Lond. 1741. The Appendix, No. 2 contains the Letter, with this notice--"Written
by a Gentleman of Charlestown, who, with some others, went thither, [i.e. to Savannah] out
of curiosity."]

"Mr. Oglethorpe is indefatigable, and takes a great deal of pains. His fare is but indifferent,
having little else at present but salt provisions. He is extremely well beloved by all the
people. The general title they give him is Father. If any of them are sick, he immediately
visits them, and takes a great deal of care of them. If any difference arises, he is the person
that decides it. Two happened while I was there, and in my presence; and all the parties went
away, to outward appearance, satisfied and contented with his determination. He keeps a strict
discipline. I never saw one of his people drunk, nor heard one of them swear, all the time
I was there. He does not allow them rum; but in lieu gives them English beer. It is surprizing
to see how cheerful the men go to work, considering they have not been bred to it. There are
no idlers there. Even the boys and girls do their part. There are four houses already up, but
none finished; and he hopes, when he has got more sawyers, which I suppose he will have in
a short time, to finish two houses a week. He has ploughed up some land; part of which he has
sowed with wheat, which has come up, and looks promising. He has two or three gardens, which
he has sowed with divers sorts of seed, and planted thyme, sage, pot-herbs, leeks, skellions,
celery, liquorice, &c., and several trees. He was palisading the town and inclosing some part
of the common; which I suppose may be finished in about a fortnight's time. In short, he has
done a vast deal of work for the time; and I think his name justly deserves to be immortalized."

"Colonel Bull, who had been sent by Governor Johnson to assist in laying out the town, and
to describe to the people the manner of felling the trees, and of clearing, breaking up, and
cultivating the ground, was a very efficient helper. He brought with him four of his negroes,
who were sawyers, to help the workmen; and also provisions for them; being resolved not to
put the Trustees to any expense; but to bestow his aid in the most free and useful manner.
Others from Carolina, also, sent laborers, who, being accustomed to preparing a plantation
for settlement, were very expert, and of essential service."

Thus generously assisted, the new settlers were enabled to cut down a great number of trees[1];
to clear the land, to construct comfortable houses[2], to make enclosures of yards and gardens,
to build a guard-house and fortification, and to effect other means of accommodation and defence.

[Footnote 1: Four beautiful pine-trees were left upon the plain, under which General Oglethorpe
encamped.]

[Footnote 2: These were all of the same size; 22 by 16 feet. The town-lots consisted of one
quarter of an acre; but they had other lots, at a small distance out of town, consisting of
five acres, designed for plantations.]

A public garden was laid out, which was designed as a nursery, in order to supply the people
with white mulberry trees, vines, oranges, olives, and various necessary plants, for their
several plantations; and a gardener was appointed for the care of it, to be paid by the Trustees.

Things being put in a good train, and the proper station and employment of every man assigned
him, Oglethorpe went to Charlestown on a visit to Governor Johnson and the Council. His object
was to make a more intimate acquaintance with them, gratefully to acknowledge the succors for
the new comers which had been so generously bestowed; and to consult measures for their mutual
intercourse.

On Saturday, June 9th, presenting himself before the Governor and House of Assembly, he thus
addressed them.

"I should think myself very much wanting in justice and gratitude, if I should neglect thanking
your Excellency, you gentlemen of the Council, and you gentlemen of the Assembly, for the assistance
which you have given to the Colony of Georgia. I have long wished for an opportunity of expressing
my sense of the universal zeal which the inhabitants of this province have shewn for assisting
that colony; and could not think of any better opportunity than now, when the whole province
is virtually present in its General Assembly. I am, therefore, gentlemen, to thank you for
the handsome assistance given by private persons, as well as by the public. I am to thank you,
not only in the name of the Trustees, and the little colony now in Georgia, but in behalf of
all the distressed people of Britain and persecuted Protestants of Europe, to whom a place
of refuge will be secured by this first attempt.

"Your charitable and generous proceeding, besides the self-satisfaction which always attends
such actions, will be of the greatest advantage to this province. You, gentlemen, are the best
judges of this; since most of you have been personal witnesses of the dangerous blows which
this country has escaped from French, Spanish, and Indian arms. Many of you know this by experience,
having signalized yourselves personally, either when this province by its own strength, and
unassisted by any thing but the courage of its inhabitants and the providence of God, repulsed
the formidable invasions of the French; or when it defeated the whole body of the southern
Indians, who were armed against it, and was invaded by the Spaniards, who assisted them. You,
gentlemen, know that there was a time when every day brought fresh advices of murders, ravages,
and burnings; when no profession or calling was exempted from arms; when every inhabitant of
the province was obliged to leave wife, family, and useful occupations, and undergo the fatigues
of war, for the necessary defence of the country; and all their endeavors scarcely sufficient
to guard the western and southern frontiers against the Indians.

"It would be needless for me to tell you, who are much better judges, how the increasing settlement
of a new colony upon the southern frontiers, will prevent the like danger for the future. Nor
need I tell you how every plantation will increase in value, by the safety of the Province
being increased; since the lands to the southward already sell for above double what they did
before the new Colony arrived. Nor need I mention the great lessening of the burden of the
people by increasing the income of the tax from the many thousand acres of land either taken
or taking up on the prospect of future security.

"The assistance which the Assembly have given, though not quite equal to the occasion, is very
large with respect to the present circumstances of the Province; and, as such, shows you to
be kind benefactors to your new-come countrymen, whose settlements you support; and dutiful
subjects to his Majesty, whose revenues and dominions you by this means increase and strengthen.

"As I shall soon return to Europe, I must recommend the infant Colony to your further protection;
being assured, both from your generosity and wisdom, that you will, in case of any danger or
necessity, give it the utmost support and assistance."

To the insertion of this speech in the Political State of Great Britain, October, 1733, page
361, it is added, "On the Sunday evening following he set out again for Georgia; so that we
may perceive that there is no endeavor wanting in him to establish and make that settlement
a flourishing colony; but his conduct in this whole affair is by much the more extraordinary,
and the more to be applauded, because, by the nature of the settlement, he cannot so much as
expect any private or particular benefit; he cannot possibly have any other reward but that
which is the certain, the eternal reward of good actions, a consciousness of having done a
service to his country, and to mankind."

Favored by their industry, and the smiles of a propitious providence in that delightful region,
"the wilderness and the solitary place was glad for them; and the desert rejoiced and blossomed
as a rose."[1] "They planted vineyards, and made themselves gardens, and set out in them trees
of all kinds of fruits."[2]

[Footnote 1: Isaiah, xxxv. 1.]

[Footnote 2: Ecclesiastes, ii. 3.]

In aid and encouragement of the settlement, the Trustees received a letter from THOMAS PENN,
Proprietor of Pennsylvania, dated Philadelphia, March 6th, 1732-3, approving very highly of
the undertaking, promising to contribute all the assistance in his power, and acquainting them
that he had for himself subscribed one hundred pounds sterling, and that he was collecting
what sums of money he could get from others, to be sent them, in order to be employed for the
purposes of their charter[1].

[Footnote 1: Political State of Great Britain, for June, 1733, Vol. XLV. p. 543.]

It has been already observed that "Oglethorpe endeavored very early to secure the favor of
the Indians, who, by ranging through the woods, would be capable of giving constant intelligence
to prevent any surprise upon the people, and would be a good out-guard for the inland parts
of the Colony; as also to obtain of them grants of territory, and privilege of undisturbed
occupancy and improvement[1]." He was pleased, therefore, on his return from Charlestown, to
find the chiefs of the Lower Creeks in waiting; the purpose of whose visit, as made known by
Mr. Wiggan[2] and Mr. John Musgrove, who acted as interpreters, was to treat on an alliance
with the Colony. Their deputation was composed of their micoes, or chiefs, and leading warriors,
about fifty in number.[1]

[Footnote 1: "Besides a king, every Indian town has a head warrior, who is in great esteem
among them, and whose authority seems to be greater than their kings; because the king is looked
upon as little else than a civil magistrate, except it so happens that he is at the same time
a head warrior." Narrative of a Journey among the Indians in the Northwest parts of South Carolina,
1731, by Sir ALEXANDER CUMING. See, also, Appendix, No. XII.]

The General received them with courtesy, and then invited them to "a talk," in one of the new
houses. He informed them that the English, by coming to settle there, did not pretend to dispossess,
nor think to annoy the natives; but above all things desired to live on good terms with them,
and hoped, through their representatives, now present, to obtain from them a cession of that
part of the region on which he had entered, and to form and confirm a treaty of friendship
and trade.

When he had explained his views with respect to the settlers, and their designs in making the
location, Ouechachumpa, a very tall old man, in the name of the rest, informed the British
adventurers what was the extent of the country claimed by their tribes. He acknowledged the
superiority of the white men to the red; and said that he was persuaded that the Great Spirit
who dwelt above and all around, (whose immensity he endeavored to express by throwing abroad
his hands, and prolonging his articulations as he spoke,) had sent the English thither for
the good of the natives; and, therefore, they were welcome to all the land which the Creeks
did not use themselves. He confirmed his speech by laying before Oglethorpe eight buckskins,
one for each of the Creeks; the best things, he said, that they had to bestow. He thanked them
for their kindness to Tomo Chichi, who, it seems, had been banished with some of his adherents,
from his own nation; but for his valor and wisdom had been chosen mico by the Yamacraws, an
emigrating branch of the same stock.

The declarations of the speaker were confirmed by short speeches of the others; when Tomo Chichi,
attended by some of his friends, came in, and, making a low obeisance, said, "When these white
men came, I feared that they would drive us away, for we were weak; but they promised not to
molest us. We wanted corn and other things, and they have given us supplies; and now, of our
small means, we make them presents in return. Here is a buffalo skin, adorned with the head
and feathers of an eagle. The eagle signifies speed, and the buffalo strength. The English
are swift as the eagle, and strong as the buffalo. Like the eagle they flew hither over great
waters; and like the buffalo nothing can withstand them. But the feathers of the eagle are
soft, and signify kindness; and the skin of the buffalo is covering, and signifies protection.
Let these, then, remind them to be kind, and protect us."

The alliance was soon made. The treaty contained stipulations on the part of the English, concerning
trade; reparation of injuries, should any be committed; and punishment for impositions, should
any be practised upon them; and, on the part of the Indians, a free and formal cession of that
part of the region which was not used by the Yamacraws, nor wanted by the Creeks. By this cession
they made a grant to the Trustees of the lands upon Savannah river as far as the river Ogechee,
and all the lands along the sea-coast between Savannah and Alatamaha rivers, extending west
as high as the tide flows, and including all the islands; the Indians reserving to themselves
the islands of Ossabaw, Sapeloe, and St. Catherines, for the purposes of hunting, bathing and
fishing; as also the tract of land lying between Pipe-maker's bluff and Pallachucola creek,
above Yamacraw bluff, which they retained as an encampment when they should come to visit their
beloved friends in that vicinity. This special reservation of some islands had been made by
them in their treaty with Governor Nicholson, in 1722.

Oglethorpe then presented to each of the eight chiefs a laced coat and hat, and a shirt; to
each of the eight war-captains, a gun, with powder, flint, bullets and shot; to the beloved
men a duffle mantle of coarse cloth;--and distributed some smaller presents among their attendants.
Upon this they took their leave of him, highly satisfied with the treatment which they had met.[1]

[Footnote 1: This Treaty was sent to England, and was confirmed by the Trustees on the 18th
of October, 1733. For a copy of it, see McCALL, History of Georgia, Appendix to Vol. I. p. 357.

The History of Georgia, by Major McCALL has great merit. It was written by the worthy author
under circumstances of bodily suffering, submitted to, indeed with meekness, borne with heroic
fortitude, and endured with unfailing patience. It is wonderful that he succeeded so well in
the accomplishment of his work, considering the scanty materials which he could procure; for
he says, that, "without map or compass, he entered an unexplored forest, destitute of any other
guide than a few ragged pamphlets, defaced newspapers, and scraps of manuscripts."]

Having taken much pains to become acquainted with the character of the natives, he furnished
a very intelligent traveller, by whom he was visited, with an interesting account of their
manners and customs; who annexed it to the published volume of his travels.[1]

[Footnote 1: As this is an extremely rare book, I give the title from a copy in the library
of Harvard College. "A new voyage to Georgia, by a young gentleman: giving an account of his
travels in South Carolina, and part of North Carolina. To which is added a curious account
of the Indians by an Honorable Person; and a Poem to James Oglethorpe, Esq., on his arrival
from Georgia." London, 1735. 12mo.

The author of the "History of Georgia," contained in the 40th volume of the "Universal History,"
page 456, quotes passages from this "Account of the Indians," and ascribes it to Oglethorpe.--Mr.
SALMON in the 3d vol. of his Modern History, p. 602, giving an account of the present state
of Georgia, introduces a quotation from what he calls "Mr. OGLETHORPE'S account of the religion
and government of the Creeks," in the following words: "Mr. OGLETHORPE, speaking of the religion
and government of the Creek nation, in 'a letter from Georgia to a person of honor in London,'
says 'There seems to be a way opened to our Colony towards the conversion of the Indians,'
&c. This is decisive in fixing the author; for Mr. SALMON knew the General personally; and,
on publishing another edition of his elaborate work, obtained from him, a very interesting
'Continuation of the present state of Georgia.'" The Letter is copied into the Gentleman's
Magazine, Vol. III. p. 108 and 483. See also Appendix, No. XIII.]

On the 18th of June he went to the Horse-quarter, which lies six miles up the river Ogechee,
and there took with him Captain McPherson, with a detachment of his rangers, on an excursion
into the interior. After a march of forty miles westward, he chose a post, commanding the passages
by which the Indians used to invade Carolina in the late wars. Here, upon an eminence which
commands all the country round, he directed that a fortification should be built, to be called
"Fort Argyle," in memory of his honored patron John Duke of Argyle.[1] It is on the west bank
of the Ogechee river. Its design was to protect the settlers from invasions by the Spaniards.
Captain McPherson and his troop were to be quartered there, and ten families from Savannah
to be removed, as cultivators, to its immediate vicinity.

[Footnote 1: See Appendix, No. XIV.]

On the 7th of July, at day break, the inhabitants of Savannah were assembled on the strand
for the purpose of designating the wards of the town, and assigning the lots. In a devotional
service, they united in thanksgiving to God, that the lines had fallen to them in a pleasant
place, and that they were about to have a goodly heritage. The wards and tithings were then
named; each ward consisting of four tithings, and each tithing of ten houses; and a house lot
was given to each freeholder. There being in Derby ward but twenty one houses built; and the
other nineteen having no house erected on them, Mr. Milledge and Mr. Goddard, the two chief
carpenters, offered, in the name of themselves and seventeen of their helpers, to take the
unbuilt on lots, and give the built ones to those who were less able to help themselves.

The people then partook of a plentiful dinner, which their generous Governor had provided.[1]

[Footnote 1: An account of this transaction in the South Carolina Gazette, under the date of
August 8th, closes with this remark; "Some of the people having privately drunk too freely
of rum, are dead; and that liquor, which was always discountenanced there, is now absolutely
prohibited."]

In the afternoon the grant of a Court of Record was read, and the officers were appointed.
The session of the magistrates was then held, a jury impanneled, and a case tried.

These were necessary regulations for establishing a due regard to order, discipline, and government.
And yet, with all the influence which their honored leader could give to sanction the measures
and support the authority, there was much to be done to render the administration effective.
The settlers had no common bond of attachment or accordance; of course, it was very difficult
to dispose them to the reciprocal offices of a social state, much more so to the still higher
obligations of a civil compact. Together with these aims of those who were put into places
of authority, they were obliged daily to use their endeavors to bring the restive and quarrelsome
into proper subordination; to keep the sluggish and lazy diligently employed, and to teach
the thriftless to be economical and prudent.

"Tantae molis erat disjunctis condere Gentem!"

Oglethorpe intended to have made the tour of the Colonies; particularly to have visited Boston,
in Massachusetts. Apprized of this intention, Governor Belcher addressed to him the following
letter[1].

[Footnote 1: Copied from the letter-book of Governor Belcher, in the cabinet of the Massachusetts
Historical Society.]

    Boston, New England, May 3d, 1733. HONORED SIR,

    It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you on your safe
    arrival in America; and I have a still greater in the advantages
    which these parts of his Majesty's dominions will reap from your
    noble and generous pursuits of good to mankind in the settlement
    of Georgia. May God Almighty attend you with his blessing, and
    crown your toils with success. Several of my friends, sir, from
    London, acquaint me with your intentions to pass by land from
    South Carolina, through the king's territories as far as this
    place; where I shall be very proud of shewing you the just esteem
    which I have for you; and shall depend that you will please to
    accept such quarters as my habitation affords during your stay in
    this government. When you get to Philadelphia or New York, I shall
    be glad of the favor of a line from you, to know how and when you
    make your route hither.

    I am, with great respect, sir,

    Your most obedient, and most humble servant,

    JONATHAN BELCHER.

At the next Assembly of the Province, the Governor, in a special message, apprized them of
the expectation which he had of a visit from the General; and in the House of Representatives
"it was ordered that a committee should be raised to prepare for the reception of James Oglethorpe,
Esq., who may be expected in Boston this summer; that so the government may express their grateful
sense of his good services to the public interest of the Province."

June 21st, 1733, the following motion was agreed on:--

"Whereas James Oglethorpe, Esq., a member of Parliament, and now at Georgia, near South Carolina,
hath at several times appeared in favor of New England; and, in a particular manner done many
good offices for this Province, of which this Court hath been advised by Mr. Agent Wilkes,
and that he intends, in a short time, to return to Great Britain, by the way of Boston:--

"Voted, That Mr. Speaker, Mr. Cooke, Major Brattle, Mr. Thacher, Mr. Welles, Mr. Cushing, Mr.
Hall, Mr. Webb, and Major Bowles, be a Committee, from this House, to congratulate that honorable
gentleman upon his arrival at Boston; and, in their name and behalf, acquaint him that the
Assembly are well knowing of the many good offices he hath done this Province, in that, when
the interest, trade, and business thereof have been under the consideration of the British
Parliament, he hath, in a distinguishing manner, consulted measures to perpetuate the peace
and lasting happiness of this government. And, as his worthy and generous actions justly deserve
a most grateful and public acknowledgment, to assure him that this country will retain a lasting
remembrance of his great benefactions; and that a recognition of the favors which they have
so frequently received from him, is the least that the House can offer; while they earnestly
desire the continuance of his good will towards this Province."

His Excellency then made the following speech:

"Gentlemen of the Council and House of Representatives,

"I am glad to see the respect which you have expressed in your vote to the Honorable Mr. Oglethorpe,
a member of that wise and august body, the Parliament of Great Britain; but, as there is no
money in the treasury to defray the charge of the reception and entertainment of that honorable
gentleman, I have taken early care to invite him to my house, when he may come into this Province,
and I shall endeavor to entertain him in such a manner as may express the great esteem which
I have of his attachment to his Majesty and to his Royal House, and of his regard to this Province,
as well as of his great merit. And this I will do at my own charge, till the treasury may be
supplied. And for these reasons I have not made your vote an order of this Court."

The Editor of the publication, entitled "The Political State of Great Britain," makes the following
remarks upon these doings of the Legislature of Massachusetts:[1]

[Footnote 1: Vol. XLVIII. p. 173.]

"This expression of gratitude towards Mr. Oglethorpe shows that the gentlemen who are members
of the House of Representatives in that Colony, are men of good sense as well as lovers of
their country; and there is certainly no greater incitement to generous and public spirited
actions than that of public acknowledgment and praise."

Circumstances, however, prevented his making a visit, so earnestly expected, and which would
have been so mutually gratifying.

On Wednesday, January 23, 1734, Oglethorpe set out on an exploratory excursion, to view the
southern frontiers, in a row-boat commanded by Captain Ferguson, attended by fourteen companions
and two Indians; followed by a yawl loaded with ammunition and provisions. They took "the inland
passages." Thus are named the passes between the belt of "sea-islands" and the main land. For
the distance of seven miles from the ocean along the whole coast, there is a margin of islands
and marshes, intersected by rivers, creeks, and inlets, communicating with each other, and
forming a complete inland navigation for vessels of one hundred tons.

Having reached the north-west coast of the islands of Ossabaw, St. Catherine, and Sapelo, they
passed the entrances of Vernon river, of the Ogechee, and of the northern branches of the Alatamaha;
and, on the 26th landed on the first Albany bluff of St. Simons, where they lay dry under the
shelter of a large live oak tree, though it rained hard. The next day they proceeded to the
sea point of St. Simons, in order to take an observation of the latitude. They afterwards discovered
an island, of which the general asked the name, and, finding that it had none, he called it
JEKYL, in honor of Sir Joseph Jekyl, his respected and particular friend[1]. They reconnoitred
various other places, and the mouths of rivers; and, on their return went up the Ogechee to
Fort Argyle, where they lay in a house and upon beds, "for the first time since they left Thunderbolt[2]."

[Footnote 1: This eminent man, who was the son of a clergyman in Northamptonshire, Great Britain,
became known as an able lawyer, and an eloquent statesman. As the friend of the Whigs, he was
one of the managers of Sacheverell's trial; and, after maintaining his principles and popularity
undiminished, he was made, in the reign of George I., Master of the Rolls and Privy Counsellor,
and was also knighted. He died in 1738, aged 75.]

[Footnote 2: This startling appellation was early given to a little settlement in the neighborhood
of Savannah, in reference to an awful explosion there, the effects of which were said to be
perceivable in the sulphuric smell and taste of a spring of water. "Adhuc tenet nomen, indelibile!"]

The fortifications there, by the unwearied diligence of Captain McPherson, were finished, and
very defensible; being well flanked, and having several pieces of cannon.[1]

[Footnote 1: Letter from a Gentleman of Savannah to his friend at Charlestown, S.C., inserted
in The New England Weekly Journal, May 13, 1734.]

By this excursion he ascertained how expedient it was to have an outpost, with a well-manned
fort on the island of St. Simons; and how desirable to form a settlement and military station
near the mouth of the Alatamaha, for the protection and defence of the colony.[1]

[Footnote 1: "At the west side of the island is a high bluff, compared with the marshes in
its front; and here Frederica was afterwards built. The shore is washed by a fine river, which
communicates with the Alatamaha, and enters the ocean through Jekyl sound, at the south end
of the island. It forms a bay which is navigable for vessels of large burden." McCALL, I. 170.]

A strong sense of indignation had been expressed in England at the persecution of the Protestants
at Saltzburg, in Bavaria, who had been banished by an Episcopal edict from their homes on account
of their religion, and, in the midst of winter, driven from the region to seek a place of refuge[1].
Oglethorpe had shared largely in the general sympathy; and, in a speech in the House of Commons,
had declared his regret that no provision had been made for their relief in the late treaty.
He proposed to the Trustees for settling the colony of Georgia, that an asylum should be there
opened for these exiles. The proposition met with ready concurrence. A letter was addressed
to their Elder, the venerable Samuel Urlsperger, to inquire whether a body of them would be
disposed to join the new settlers, if measures were taken for their transportation. A favorable
answer was received. An English vessel was sent to convey them from Rotterdam to Dover; and
thence they embarked on the 8th of January, 1734, on board the ship Purrysburgh, Captain Frey,
under the more immediate care and conduct of the Baron Philip George Frederick Von Reck, together
with their Reverend Pastors, John Martin Bolzius and Israel Christian Gronau. After many difficulties
and dangers, they arrived at Charlestown, South Carolina, on the 7th of March[2]. Oglethorpe,
who happened to be there, as they piously considered, "providentially," bid them a cheering
welcome. He had their ship supplied with provisions; and sent the sea-sick pilgrims, what is
so grateful and refreshing after a voyage, many baskets of cabbages, turnips, radishes, lettuce,
and other vegetables, "of which the gardens were full." He introduced the Baron and the ministers
to the Governor, who received them with much civility, and with whom they dined.

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, 1732, p. 866, and Appendix, No. XV.]

[Footnote 2: See Appendix, No. XVI.]

The General sent one of his men to their ship, as a pilot, as also to announce their arrival,
and bespeak the attention of the magistrates at Savannah; and, on the 9th they set sail for
the desired region of peace. They entered the river on the 10th, which was reminiscere-Sunday;
and "they called to remembrance the former days, in which, after they were illuminated," (and
because they were so,) "they endured a great fight of afflictions, partly while they were made
a gazing-stock in their dispersions, and partly while they became companions of them that were
so. But they took unresistingly the spoiling of their goods, trusting to those who had compassion
on their sufferings."[1] "And they remembered the kindnesses of Oglethorpe."

[Footnote 1: Hebrews, x. 32-34.]

In the journal of their pastor,[1] it is stated, "While we lay off the banks of our dear Georgia,
in a very lovely calm, and heard the birds singing sweetly, all was cheerful on board. It was
really edifying to us that we came to the borders of 'the promised land,' this day, when, as
we are taught in its lesson from the Gospel, that Jesus came to the borders by the sea-coast,
after he had endured persecution and rejection by his countrymen."

[Footnote 1: URLSPURGER, I. p. 80.]

On the 11th the ship got upon the sand; but was floated off by the tide on the 12th, and as
they passed up the river, they were delighted with the pleasant prospect on both sides. The
balmy odors of the pine trees, wafted by the land-breeze, seemed like incense mingling with
their orisons, and the carols of the birds were in accordance with their matin-hymn of praise.
This second reference to the minstrelsy of the grove, will not be wondered at by those who
have visited that region in the spring of the year. The various notes of the feathered choristers
are enchanting, even now, when the din of population has frightened them into coverts. But
then, free and fearless, the strains were lively and joyful, and the chorus full.

As the vessel was moored near the landing-place, the inhabitants flocked down to the bank,
and raised a cheering shout, which was responded with much gladness by the passengers on deck.
Some of them were soon taken off in a boat, and led round to the town, part through the wood,
and part through the newly laid out garden of the Trustees. Meanwhile "a right good feast"
was prepared for them, and they were regaled with "very fine wholesome English beer." And,
as otherwise much love and friendliness were shewn them by the inhabitants, and as the beautiful
situation round about pleased them, they were in fine spirits, and their joy was consecrated
by praise to God.

The pastors Gronau and Bolzius, with the commissary Von Reck, and Dr. Zweitzer were lodged
in the house of the Reverend Mr. Quincy[1], whom they had met at Charlestown, on his return
from a visit which he had been paying to his parents in Boston, Massachusetts, when he obligingly
offered them the accommodation. For the emigrants barracks and tents were provided till the
return of the General from Charlestown, whither he had gone to take passage for England, "but
out of good will to the Saltzburgers, he put off his voyage for some days, and was resolved
to see them settled before he went[2]." He had promised them that they should have liberty
to choose such part of the country as they thought most convenient, fertile and pleasant; and
that he would go out with some of their elders, and select a place to their liking. They desired
one at a distance from the sea, on gently rising ground, with intervening vales, near springs
of water, and on the border of a small river, or clear brook; such being the nature of the
region where they were born. To fulfil this engagement, immediately after his return, attended
with Paul Jenys, Esq., Speaker of the House of Assembly of South Carolina, and some other gentlemen,
he set out on the 15th of March, with Baron Von Reck, the commissary, Mr. Gronau, one of the
ministers, Mr. Zweitzer their Doctor, and one of the elders, taking some Indians as guides,
to explore the part of the country which answered to the description of the Saltzburgers. They
went up the river in boats as far as Mr. Musgrove's cow-pens, where horses were got ready;
and, after a ride of about fifteen miles, westward, through the woods, they arrived at the
banks of a river, eighty feet wide, and twelve deep, with high banks. The adjacent country
was hilly, with valleys of cane-land, intersected with little brooks, and bordered with springs
of water. The Saltzburgers were extremely pleased with the place, and adopted it They then
kneeled down by the river side, and devoutly thanked God for bringing them out of their persecutions,
safe through so many dangers, into a land of rest; in memorial of which, they desired that
the place might be called EBENEZER--"Hitherto the Lord hath helped us!" With the Bible in their
hands, they then marched up to a site which was judged most proper to build upon; sung an hymn,
and the pastor pronounced a benediction.

[Footnote 1: The Rev. Samuel Quincy, a native of Boston, Massachusetts, having been educated
in England, and received priest's orders on the 28th of October, 1730, by Dr. Waugh, Bishop
of Carlisle, was, in 1734 sent, by the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts,
as a missionary to Georgia.]

[Footnote 2: Extract from a manuscript of Von Reck's Journal, furnished me by J.K. Tefft, Esq.
of Savannah.]

Having thus assigned to the exiles, "a local habitation and a name," they all went to Abercorn,
a village lately built, about the distance of six miles. Thence the commissary and his companions
returned to Savannah, and Oglethorpe, with the speaker, went to Purrysburgh on the 18th in
order to row up the river to the Palachocolas Indians, but the floods from the Cherokee mountains
had so swelled the freshes, as to make that passage too tedious. They, therefore, went back
to Abercorn, and thence to the designed settlement of the Saltzburgers, where Oglethorpe, parting
with his honorable friend, crossed the river with the Indians, and renewed his excursion to
Palachocolas. There he found a fort erected at the lowest passage of the river, and forty-five
miles from Savannah. Returning from this visit, as he entered Ebenezer he found eight of the
most able-bodied men at work, with their minister Gronau, in constructing booths and tents
against the arrival of the families. In furtherance of their labors, he laid out the town,
and directed the carpenters, who had arrived also in obedience to his orders, to assist in
building six houses.

These attentions to the accommodation of the poor Protestants were gratefully acknowledged,
and are recorded in the journal of the Reverend Mr. Bolzius, with a respectful tribute to the
religious character of Oglethorpe, of which the following is a translation;[1] "So far as we
can conclude from a short acquaintance with him, he is a man who has a great reverence for
God, and his holy word and ordinances; a cordial love for the servants and children of God;
and who wishes to see the name of Christ glorified in all places. So blest have been his undertakings
and his presence in this land, that more has been accomplished by him in one year than others
would have effected in many. And since the people here have had such good cause to appreciate
his right fatherly disposition, his indefatigable toil for their welfare, and his illustrious
qualities, they feel that his departure would be a real loss to them. For us he hath cared
with a most provident solicitude. We unite in prayers for him, that God would guide him to
his home, make his voyage safe and prosperous, and enrich him with many blessings!"

[Footnote 1: URLSPURGER, I. p. 91.]

In journeys often and labors more abundant, he returned to Savannah; and set out from thence
on the 23d of March, with the Speaker, to Charlestown, where he arrived on the 27th with a
retinue of Indian chiefs, whom he had persuaded to accompany him to England. He had rightly
judged that it would be an advantage to the colony to let some of the natives have a sight
of England, as it would give them a high idea of that kingdom. He had gained the consent of
Tomo Chichi and Scenawki his wife and Toonahowi his nephew; of Hillispilli, the war chief;
Apakowtski, Stimalchi, Sintouchi, and Hinguithi, five chiefs of the Creek nation; and of Umphichi,
a chief from Palachocolas; with their interpreter.

They embarked in the Aldborough man of war on Tuesday, the 7th of May, 1734.

The Aldborough arrived at St. Helen's, in the Isle of Wight, on the 16th of June, 1734, bringing
the founder of the new Colony, with the most gratifying accounts of his labors and success.
He had "laid the foundation of many generations." He had made "the desolate wilderness a pleasant
portion;" and, for its wildlings, had substituted offsets which should become "plants of renown."
And he had brought with him some chiefs of the Indian tribes, to testify their accordance with
the new settlement, and to repeat the expression of their desire to receive instruction in
the language and religion of the settlers.

When a Roman General returned a conqueror, he entered the Imperial City with a triumphal procession,
in martial pomp and pageantry, dragging at his car the kings and captains he had vanquished.
But here was a return from a successful campaign, not bringing captives taken in battle, but
an escort of unconquered chieftains, themselves sharers in the ovation of benevolence and the
triumph of philanthropy.

Oglethorpe immediately addressed a letter to Sir John Phillips, Baronet, notifying him of his
return, and giving him the pleasing intelligence of the safe arrival of the Baron Von Reck,
and the Saltzburgers, whom he called "a very sensible, active, laborious, and pious people."
He mentioned their location as selected to their liking; and said that he left them busily
employed in completing its settlement. He added, "An Indian chief, named Tomo Chichi, the Mico,
or king of Yamacraw, a man of an excellent understanding, is so desirous of having the young
people taught the English language and religion, that, notwithstanding his advanced age, he
has come over hither with me to obtain means, and assistant teachers. He has brought with him
a young man whom he calls his nephew and next heir; and who has already learned the Lord's
prayer in the English and Indian language."

"I shall leave the Indians at my estate, till I go to the city, where I shall have the happiness
to wait upon you, and to relate all things to you more fully; over which you will rejoice and
wonder[1]."

[Footnote 1: Not having met with an English copy of the letter, I have given a version from
the German in "Ausfürliche Nachrichten von der Salzburgischen en America, von SAMUEL URLSPURGHER".
Halle, 1745. 4to.]

Having repaired to his house in old Palace-Yard, Westminster, he notified the Trustees of his
arrival. Some of the gentlemen immediately called on him, and escorted him to the Georgia office,
where he received their congratulations, with "expressions of their great satisfaction in the
eminent services which he had performed in behalf of their new settlement."[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, June, 1734, p. 327.]

On the evening of the 21st they gave a grand entertainment in honor of so distinguished an
associate; and heard from him, with admiration, the narrative of his achievements.[1]

[Footnote 1: London Magazine, June, 1734.]

On a special meeting they "voted their unanimous thanks to him for the ability, zeal, activity,
and perseverance with which he had conducted the affairs of the settlement, and assured him
that they should ever hold his services in grateful remembrance."

A publication of the day thus announces his arrival;[1] "On the 16th of last month, James Oglethorpe,
Esq., member of Parliament for Haslemere, in Surrey, and of the Trustees for establishing the
Colony of Georgia, arrived in the Aldborough man of war, at St. Helen's, on his return from
that colony; he having had so much generosity and public spirit as to go along with the first
number of persons that were sent out for its establishment, where he has been ever since; being
resolved to be a sharer with them in all the fatigues and dangers that might happen, either
from the inclemency of a new climate, or from any of the accidents that usually attend the
settlement of a new colony; and not to leave them till he saw them in a condition, not only
to provide their own subsistence, but to defend themselves against any enemy that might probably
attack them; all which fatigues and dangers he exposed himself to, and has undergone at his
own charge, and without the least view of any private advantage or satisfaction, but that which
every good man must feel in contributing to the relief of the distressed, and the public good
of his country. This is such an action as the Roman historians, in the times of their greatest
virtue, would have been proud of recording; and such an one as ought not to escape the notice
of any man who pretends to give an account of the transactions of this kingdom."

[Footnote 1: Political State of Great Britain, Vol. XVIII. p. 19.]

His return was congratulated in some very complimentary verses; as was also the arrival of
Tomo Chichi[1]; and the head of Oglethorpe was proposed by Mr. Urban for a prize medal[2],
to commemorate his benevolence and patriotism.

Comfortable apartments were provided for the Indians in the Georgia office; and, when they
were suitably dressed, and had curiously painted their faces, according to their custom, Sir
Clement Cotterell was sent, on the 1st of August, to the Georgia office, whence he took them
all, except one who was sick with the small pox, and had them conveyed, in three of the King's
coaches, drawn by six horses, to the palace at Kensington. They were received at the door by
the body guards, and then, by the Duke of Grafton, Lord Chamberlain, presented to his Majesty,
whom Tomo Chichi addressed in the following characteristic terms.

"Great king; this day I see the majesty of your person, the greatness of your house, and the
number of your people. I am come in my old days; so I cannot expect to obtain any advantage
to myself; but I come for the good of the Creeks, that they may be informed about the English,
and be instructed in your language and religion. I present to you, in their name, the feathers
of an eagle, which is the swiftest of birds, and flieth around our nations. These feathers
are emblems of peace in our land, and have been carried from town to town, to witness it. We
have brought them to you, to be a token and pledge of peace, on our part, to be kept on yours.

"O great king! whatsoever you shall say to me, I will faithfully tell to all the chiefs of
the Creek nation."

To this the king replied,--"I am glad of this opportunity of assuring you of my regard for
the people from whom you came; and I am extremely well pleased with the assurance which you
have brought me from them. I accept, very gratefully, this present, as an indication of their
good dispositions towards me and my people; and shall always be ready to show them marks of
favor, and purposes to promote their welfare."

They were then introduced to her Majesty, who was seated on a throne in the great gallery,
attended by ladies of the court and nobility. The aged Mico thus addressed her: "I am glad
to see you this day, and to have the opportunity of beholding the mother of this great nation.
As our people are now joined with yours, we hope that you will be a common mother, and a protectress
of us and our children." To this her Majesty returned a courteous answer.

After this they were introduced to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cumberland,
the Princess of Orange, the Princesses Amelia, Caroline, Mary, and Louisa; and then were conducted
back to their lodgings.

On the 3d of August they were greatly afflicted by the decease of one of their companions by
the small pox, notwithstanding the best medical attendance; but it occasioned no bad consequences,
as his associates were with him, and saw that much better care was taken of him than could
have been at home. He was interred, after the manner of their country, in St. John's burial
ground, Westminster. The corpse, sewed up in two blankets, with a deal-board under and another
over, and tied down with a cord, was carried to the grave on a bier. There were present only
Tomo Chichi, three of the chiefs, the upper church-warden, and the grave-digger. When the body
was laid in the earth, the clothes of the deceased were thrown in; after this, a quantity of
glass beads and some pieces of silver; the custom of these Indians being to bury such effects
of the deceased with him.

As all methods made to console them were disregarded, Oglethorpe took them out to his estate,
that in the country retirement they might have a better opportunity to bewail the dead according
to their custom, and that the change of the place might serve to abate their sorrow.

On the 17th of August, the aged and venerable Archbishop of Canterbury[1] had them taken in
his boat to Putney, where they were received and entertained in a very agreeable manner. On
taking leave, Tomo Chichi intimated his inability, from want of a knowledge of the English
language, to express suitably the acknowledgments of himself and his companions of the kind
notice taken of them.

[Footnote 1: Rev. William Wake, D.D.]

The following day they visited his Grace at Lambeth, and endeavored to make known to him how
deeply affected they were with the ignorance in religion in which they and their people were
involved; and how much they not only needed, but desired instruction. In their conference with
Dr. Lynch, the son-in-law of the Archbishop, the Mico was more explicit, and requested that
some person might be sent to teach them; more particularly their youth.

On the next day they went to Eton College, and were received by the Rev. Dr. George, Dr. Berriman,
and the rest of the Fellows present. On closing their visit to the school-room, Tomo Chichi
begged that the lads might have a holiday when the Doctor thought proper; which caused a general
huzza. They were then shewn the several apartments of the college, and took a respectful leave.
Afterwards they went to Windsor, where they were graciously received; and thence to St. George's
Chapel, where the prebends present named Dr. Maynard to compliment the Mico from the Dean and
Chapter. The following day they went to Hampton Court; saw the royal apartments; and walked
in the gardens, where a great concourse of people had assembled to see them. After these more
distinguishing attentions, they were shewn the Tower, the public buildings, Greenwich Hospital,
and all the great and interesting spectacles in London; and nothing was neglected that might
serve to awaken and gratify their curiosity, and to impress them with the grandeur and power
of the British nation.

After having staid four months, they were taken to Gravesend in one of his Majesty's carriages,
whence they embarked aboard the transport ship, the Prince of Wales, George Dunbar, Captain,
on the return voyage to Savannah, where they arrived on the 27th of December, 1734.

Captain Dunbar, in a letter to the Trustees, announcing his remarkably quick and prosperous
passage across the Atlantic, wrote thus: "We arrived here all cheerful and in good health.
The Indians behaved with their accustomed modesty; as did also, the Saltzburgers, who are a
sober and pious people, and gave much less trouble than I expected; nor do I think any of them
were dissatisfied while on board." In conclusion, he added, "Tomo Chichi, Toonahowi, Hillispilli,
and Umpichi were so kind as to come on board on the morning of our intended departure to see
me. They have a very grateful remembrance of the many civilities which they received in England,
and desire me to inform your honors that Santechi has gone to the Upper and Middle Creeks,
who are at present extremely well disposed to the British interest, and their deputies are
expected down in two months."[1]

[Footnote 1: London Magazine for March, 1735, p. 162.

Oglethorpe remained in England to attend to his duties as a member of Parliament, and to suggest
to the Trustees measures for the furtherance of the settlement of Georgia.

In consequence of the information which he could give from his personal observation, and that
which he had received from others, respecting the state of the colony, and what would be expedient
for its advancement in good order and prosperity, the Trustees prepared a regulation, which
was enacted by the government into a law, "for maintaining peace with the Indians." This included
the provisions and immunities of the act of the General Assembly of South Carolina in 1731;
and, of course, was accordant with the relations and mutual interests of both Provinces. There
was, also, passed a law for a like salutary purpose for preventing trouble with the Indians,
as well as preserving the health and morals of the people already settled or that might be
settled in their new colony, from the pernicious effects of spirituous liquors, entitled "An
act to prevent the importation and use of rum and brandies into the Province of Georgia, or
any kind of ardent spirits or strong waters whatsoever." Lond. 1741; page 16, under the year 1734.]

An unchecked indulgence in ardent spirits has ever been followed by lamentable effects. It
demoralizes the conduct, destroys health, prevents usefulness, and ruins reputation. It breaks
up domestic peace, wastes property, leads to impoverished circumstances, and entails wretchedness
upon the members of the family of which the head was the victim. The prohibition, therefore,
if it led to the disuse of the dangerous potation, would have been the present removal, and
prevented the subsequent extension, of one of the greatest evils which has corrupted the social
condition.

To these prudent and salutary regulations followed a statute entitled "An act for rendering
the Province of Georgia more defencible, by prohibiting the importation of black slaves, or
negroes, into the same." For this enactment, besides the consideration stated in the title,
the following reasons are assigned: 1. On account of the cost of purchase, which, the settlers
themselves being too poor to defray, must be met by the Trustees; on whom it would be a tax
greater than they had funds to pay, or believed that they could obtain. 2. Because of the additional
expense of their after maintenance, which must be provided, in addition to that already incurred
for the support of those by whom they were to be employed. And 3. because the Trustees were
desirous that the settlers should acquire the habits of labor and industry, of economy and
thrift, by personal application.[1]

[Footnote 1: See their reasons at large in the publication entitled Impartial Inquiry into
the State and Utility of the Province of Georgia, Lond. 1741; or in Collections of the Georgia
Historical Society, Vol. I. pages 166-173, and McCALL'S History, Vol. I. p. 25, &c.]

It is remarked by Mr. Burke, that "These regulations, though well intended, and indeed meant
to bring about very excellent purposes, yet might at first, as it did afterwards, appear, that
they were made without sufficiently consulting the nature of the country, or the disposition
of the people which they regarded."[1]

[Footnote 1: European Settlements in America, Vol. II. p. 266.]

Governor Belcher, of Massachusetts, in a letter to Lord Egmont, observes, "I have read Mr.
Oglethorpe's state of the new colony of Georgia once and again; and by its harbors, rivers,
soil and productions, do not doubt that it must in time make a fine addition to the British
Empire in America; and I still insist upon it that the prohibitory regulations of the Trustees
are essential to its healthy and prosperous condition; and the alteration of the Constitution
to the advantage of females must give great encouragement to first undertakers or settlers,
as your Lordship observes."[1]

[Footnote 1: Letter Book, in the archives of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol. V. p. 254.]

The visit of the Indians was made subservient to the favorite purpose of Oglethorpe, by rousing
attention to the improvement of the race in knowledge and religion. At their earliest interviews
with him, they had expressed a wish that their children might be taught to speak and read the
English language, and they themselves instructed in the principles of Christianity. From their
intercourse with the Carolinians for many years, they had been made sensible of the superiority
which such attainments conferred, even where that intercourse had been, as it mostly was, with
the traders; but no missionary had been sent, as in our times, to form them to civilization,
and "teach them which be the first principles of the oracles of God." Oglethorpe felt extremely
desirous of obtaining for them these advantages; and expressed to the trustees his belief that
they would readily avail themselves of an opportunity for their attainment. In furtherance
of this most important object, he applied to the Reverend Dr. Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man,
to prepare a manual of instruction for them. The good Bishop complied with his request with
great readiness; and the work was printed at the expense of "the Society for propagating the
Gospel in foreign Parts." The volume was dedicated to the Trustees; and, in the preface, the
author states that it "was undertaken in consequence of a short but entertaining conversation,
which he, and some others, had with the honorable and worthy General Oglethorpe, concerning
the condition, temper, and genius of the Indians in the neighborhood of Georgia, and those
parts of America; who, as he assured us, are a tractable people, and more capable of being
civilized and of receiving the truths of religion than we are generally made to believe, if
some hindrances were removed, and proper measures taken to awaken in them a sense of their
true interest, and of their unhappy condition, while they continue in their present state."

"And, indeed, that most worthy gentleman's great and generous concern for both the present
and future interest of these nations, and his earnest desire and endeavors, so well known,
to civilize them first, and make them more capable of instruction in the ways of religion and
civil government, and his hearty wishes that something might be done to forward such good purposes,
prevailed with the author, however indifferently qualified for such a work, to set about the
following essay for propagating the Gospel amongst the Indians and negroes."[1]

[Footnote 1: The title of the book is, "The Knowledge and Practice of Christianity made easy
to the meanest capacity; or, an Essay towards an Instruction for the Indians." London, 1740.
12mo. A tenth edition was printed in 1764; and a translation in French, at Geneva, in 1744.]

On receiving a copy of this work, when it was printed, five years afterwards, from the Reverend
Dr. Thomas Wilson, son of the Bishop, Oglethorpe addressed to him the following letter:[1]

[Footnote 1: Not finding an English copy I have translated this from the French version.]

Frederica, in Georgia, April 24, 1741.

SIR,

I have received, with not less pleasure than profit, the book sent to me by you, which was
composed by your father. This work breathes so strongly the spirit of primitive piety; its
style is so clear and simple; its plan is so easy for minds even the most limited, and at the
same time so well adapted to make them understand the most profound mysteries, that it is a
true representation of the religion in which it instructs its reader. Had our Methodists, instead
of their lofty imaginations, been taught enough of the language of the Indians to be able to
translate this book; or had they been sufficiently instructed to permit them to read it with
advantage, I doubt not that we should immediately see surprising results from it; but God will
accomplish his good work by the means which he will judge proper to employ. I have written
to Mr. Varelst to buy, to the amount of five pounds sterling, copies of your father's work,
and to send them to me.

"Have the kindness to commend me to the prayers of a Divine so worthy and pious; and be assured
that I am,

"Your affectionate friend, and very humble and obedient servant,

"JAMES OGLETHORPE."

The Trustees were now desirous of obtaining proper persons to go to Georgia to teach, and endeavor
to convert, the Indians; and to officiate as chaplains to the colonists at Savannah, and at
the new town about to be built on the island of St. Simons. They fixed their eyes upon Mr.
John Wesley and some of his associates, as very proper for such a mission. The amiable and
excellent Dr. John Burton,[1] one of the Board, who was well acquainted with Wesley, having
learned that he was in London, went thither himself, in order to accompany him to Oglethorpe,
with whom, indeed, he was already acquainted by family attentions as well as public fame. The
matter was proposed to Wesley, and strongly urged by such arguments as they thought most likely
to dispose his mind to accept the proposal.[2] Several influential friends concurred in advising
him to go; and, as even his mother encouraged it, he yielded his compliance. His brother Charles
agreed to accompany him, as did Benjamin Ingham, a member of their association at Oxford, and
Charles Delamotte, son of a merchant in London.

[Footnote 1: When the settling of Georgia was in agitation, in 1732, Dr. Burton was solicited
by the excellent Dr. Bray, and other Episcopal Clergymen,[A] to give his assistance in promoting
that undertaking. Accordingly he preached a Sermon in its recommendation before the Society
for conducting it; and his Discourse was afterwards published, with an Appendix concerning
the State of the Colony. BENTHAM, de vita et moribus Johannis Burtoni. 8vo. London, 1771, page 12.]

[Footnote A: Rev. Dr. HALES, Dr. BERRIMAN, and others.]

Rev. HENRY MOORE. 8vo. Lond. 1824. 2 vol. Vol. I. p. 334. This interview was on the 28th of
April, 1735.]

In consequence of this engagement of the Wesleys, the General deemed it highly proper to visit
their venerable and excellent parents at Epworth, not only to confirm their consent, but to
communicate to them such information as should interest them strongly in every measure which
aimed at the instruction, civilization, and christianizing of the natives of Georgia, from
whom he and the new settlers had met so kind a reception. A reference to this, gives me the
opportunity of introducing a letter from that aged minister, the Reverend Samuel Wesley, written
rather more than a year before, in which he mentions the progress which he had made in a work
that he was about to publish, and acknowledges the obligations which he was under to the General
for kindnesses shown to himself and sons.[1]

[Footnote 1: This letter is not in the "Memoirs of the Wesley Family," published by Dr. Adam
Clarke in 1822; having been recently discovered.]

Epworth, July 6, 1734.

Honored sir,

May I be admitted, while such crowds of our nobility and gentry are pouring in their congratulations,
to press with my poor mite of thanks into the presence of one who so well deserves the title
of UNIVERSAL BENEFACTOR OF MANKIND. It is not only your valuable favors on many accounts to
my son, late of Westminster, and myself, when I was not a little pressed in the world, nor
your more extensive charity to the poor prisoners; it is not these only that so much demand
my warmest acknowledgments, as your disinterested and immovable attachment to your country,
and your raising a new Colony, or rather a little world of your own in the midst of wild woods
and uncultivated deserts, where men may live free and happy, if they are not hindered by their
own stupidity and folly, in spite of the unkindness of their brother mortals.

I owe you, sir, besides this, some account of my little affairs since the beginning of your
expedition. Notwithstanding my own and my son's violent illness, which held me half a year,
and him above twelve months, I have made a shift to get more than three parts in four of my
Dissertations on Job printed off, and both the paper, printing, and maps, hitherto, paid for.
My son John at Oxford, now that his elder brother has gone to Tiverton, takes care of the remainder
of the impression at London, and I have an ingenious artist here with me in my house at Epworth
who is graving and working off the remaining maps and figures for me; so that I hope, if the
printer does not hinder me, I shall have the whole ready by next spring, and, by God's leave,
I shall be in London myself to deliver the books perfect. I print five hundred copies, as in
my proposals; whereof I have about three hundred already subscribed for; and, among my subscribers,
fifteen or sixteen English Bishops, with some of Ireland.

"If you will please herewith to accept the tender of my most sincere respect and gratitude,
you will thereby confer one further obligation, honored sir, on

"Your most obedient and humble servant,

"SAMUEL WESLEY."

"To James Oglethorpe, Esq."

It appears, from a list of subscriptions annexed to Mr. Wesley's Dissertations on the Book
of Job, that General Oglethorpe took seven copies of the work on large paper, which would amount
to at least twenty pounds.

The elder son of the Rector, also, paid a tribute of respect to the General; and this in harmonious
and polished verses; in which, however, he indulged, too freely, the poetic license in highly
wrought description of the settlement of Georgia, and of the climate and productions of the
region.[1]

[Footnote 1: GEORGIA, a Poem; TOMO CHICHI, an Ode; and a copy of Verses on Mr. Oglethorpe's
Second Voyage to Georgia. These were beautifully printed, in a large type, on nineteen folio
pages. They were ascribed to SAMUEL WESLEY, as their author, in the tract entitled "True and
Historical Narrative of the Colony of Georgia," by P. Telfair and others. Charlestown, S.C.
1741, page xi. of the Preface.]

As our narrative is brought near to the period when the General is about to return thither,
it may be pertinent to introduce a short extract, in which the poet addresses the new settlers,
eagerly expecting his arrival.

  "See once again, see on your shores descend
  Your generous leader, your unwearied friend!
  No storm or chance his vessel thither drives,
  No! to secure and bless you, he arrives.
  To Heaven the praise,--and thanks to him repay,
  And let remotest times respect the day.
  He comes, whose life, while absent from your view,
  Was one continued ministry for you;
  For you he laid out all his pains and art,
  Won every will, and softened every heart.
  With what paternal joy shall he relate
  How views the mother Isle your little State;
  How aids the Senate, how the nation loves,
  How GEORGE protects, and CAROLINE approves!--
  A thousand pleasures crowd into his breast,
  But one, one mighty thought absorbs the rest,
  'And give me, Heaven, to see, (the Patriot cries),
  Another Britain in the desert rise!'"

"Some of the first settlers had proved as idle and useless members of society in America, as
they had been in Great Britain;" and, as their external wants had been supplied from the common
store, they felt no stimulus to industry or frugality.

The Trustees, finding that the conduct of these drones and loungers tended rather to impede
than promote their benevolent intentions, began to look round for a better stock of settlers;
a hardy race, with good habits; such as were accustomed to laborious occupation and agricultural
pursuits.

That all persons who should be disposed to go to Georgia, might be fully apprized of the several
conditions which they were to perform, and of what was expected, and, indeed, would be required
of them, in return for the assistance and support that would be afforded them, a statement
was made, and rules and regulations were drawn up, printed and circulated; in which the Trustees
indicated the qualifications of such as offered themselves, with the expectation of being engaged.[1]
They examined, at their office, such persons as applied for the benefit of the charity; and,
out of these selected those who had the best characters, and were the truest and most deserving
objects of compassion.[2] They very explicitly and frankly acquainted the applicants with the
inconveniences to which they would be subjected, and the hardships which they must expect to
endure. They told them that on their arrival they would be under the necessity of living in
slight hovels, till they could form materials for the construction of houses; that they must
use great provident foresight to acquire comfortable subsistence, for their wants were to be
supplied only till their industry brought in returns. They remarked to them that they, indeed,
gave them lands, and furnished them rations for a year, but these lands were to be cleared
up and tilled, in order to yield crops; that they must eat salt meat, and drink only beer or
water. They reminded them, with solemn caution, that the sicknesses, to which a change of climate
would expose them, were most dangerous to those who drank distilled liquors; so that temperance,
which was every where commendable and salutary, would be absolutely necessary to preserve health.
Finally, they were plainly told that if they were distrustful, or reluctant at putting forth
their strenuous exertions, they must not engage in the undertaking.

[Footnote 1: Account, shewing the Progress of the Colony of Georgia. Lond. 1741. Appendix to
the Volume, No. 3 and 4.]

[Footnote 2: MOORE'S Voyage, page 10.]

Several were disheartened; but their place was soon filled up by others, who thought these
difficulties not very great; and that, whatever they might be, they could encounter them; and
that they could submit to temporary inconveniences, and persevere in efforts, stimulated by
the proffered encouragement and aid.

In Scotland the proposals of the Trustees met with such success that, at Inverness and its
vicinity, one hundred and thirty Highlanders were enrolled for emigration. These, with fifty
women and children, were transported to Georgia, where they arrived in the month of January,
1735; and with them came several private grantees, with their servants. The Scots were destined
to settle on the frontiers, for the protection and defence of the province. After tarrying
a few days at Savannah, they conveyed themselves in periaguas, to the southward; and, ascending
the Alatamaha river about sixteen miles from St. Simons, pitched upon a place for a residence,
where they soon raised a little fort, in which they mounted four pieces of cannon. They, also,
built a guard-house, a store, and a chapel, for they brought a pastor with them; and soon put
up several huts for temporary accommodation, till they could prepare and erect commodious dwellings.
The location, at their desire, was called "Darien;" which name the District still bears, and
the town they called "New Inverness," a name no longer retained.[1]

[Footnote 1: In the early publications this is written with the article--"the Darien."]

While Oglethorpe was in England, what was intended for a letter was sent over to the Trustees.
It was composed by a chief of the Cherokees, drawn and curiously marked in red and black figures
on the skin of a young buffalo, neatly dressed. A translation into English had been made from
the Indian interpretation, when first delivered, in the presence of above fifty of their chiefs,
and of the principal inhabitants of Savannah. It contained the grateful acknowledgment of the
Indians of the honors and civilities shown to Tomo Chichi and his companions; their admiration
of the grandeur of the British Court and kingdom; and declared their strong attachment to General
Oglethorpe.

This hieroglyphic painting was set in a frame, and hung up in the Georgia office in Westminster.[1]

[Footnote 1: American Gazetteer. Lond. 1762. 12mo. Vol. II., article "Georgia."]

To provide for the raising of silk-worms and winding the thread from the cocoons, was an early
purpose of the Trustees. Liberal encouragement was given by the Government and the Board of
Trade to the importation of all that could be produced. Samples had been sent to England which
gave promise of success. In the beginning of May, this year, the Trustees and Sir Thomas Lombe,
waited on the Queen with a specimen, who was highly gratified with learning that a British
Colony had produced such silk, and desired that the fabric into which it should be wrought
might be shewn her. Accordingly, on the 21st of October, these gentlemen, with Mr. Booth, the
weaver, again waited on her Majesty with a piece of the manufactured silk; and she expressed
great admiration of the beauty and fineness of the silk, and the richness of the pattern; and,
as a further testimony of her satisfaction both with the produce and the manufacture, she ordered
a suit to be made up immediately for her own wear, in which she appeared on her birth-day.[1]
To this, a poet of the time, in a description of the products of Georgia, thus alludes--

[Footnote 1: Political State of Europe, Vol. L. p. 242, and 469.]

  "The merchant hence the unwrought silk imports,
  To which we owe the attire of Queens and Courts."[1]

[Footnote 1: New Voyage to Georgia, p. 61.]

A large number of intended emigrants having been enrolled, Oglethorpe had been most busily
engaged for several months in making preparations for their embarkation. Various tools were
to be collected, suits and changes of raiment prepared, articles of maintenance selected and
packed for the public store at Savannah, and accommodations and provisions got ready for the
voyage. The indefatigable leader of the expedition gave his personal attendance and directions,
and saw that every thing was in the train of accomplishment, aided by the services and supervision
of Mr. Francis Moore, whom the Trustees had appointed keeper of the stores. Oglethorpe had
become acquainted with this gentleman as Factor to the Royal African Society, and as having
had the charge of Job Jalla ben Solomon, the African Prince, whom the Company sent back to Africa.

There were two ships freighted, the Symond, of two hundred and twenty tons, Captain Joseph
Cornish, master; and the London Merchant, of about the same burden, Captain John Thomas, master;
and one of his Majesty's sloops, under the command of Captain James Gascoigne, was ordered
to assist the Colony, and carry over the General, who intended to inspect the settlement; but
he chose to go in one of the ships, though crowded with the emigrants, "that he might be able
to take care of the people on the passage."

"The whole embarkation amounted to two hundred and twenty people on the Trust's account, besides
Mr. Oglethorpe and the gentlemen with him, and his servants, whose passage he himself paid."[1]

[Footnote 1: Voyage to Georgia, begun in the year 1735; by FRANCIS MOORE, 8vo. London, 1744,
page 11. The author accompanied General Oglethorpe on what is called "the great embarkation,"
as keeper of the stores. The first date in the book is "15th of October, 1735," and the last,
"22d of June, 1736." He resided at St. Simons, and was "Recorder at Frederica." By an advertisement,
at the end of this volume, we learn that he made another voyage to Georgia in 1738, where he
continued till 1743, when he returned to England. During his residence, he kept a Journal,
"in which is an account of the siege of St. Augustine, in 1740, and of the Spanish invasion,
in 1742." He adds, "I think myself obliged to acquaint the public that if I find the foregoing
well received, I shall, without delay, publish my other Journal, as, also, a continuance of
this, containing the treaty with the Governor of Augustine; and the regulation of several matters,
relating to the Indian nations." That the Journal was not published is greatly to be regretted.]

Among the adventurers in this embarkation, lured by the accounts which had been published in
England, of the delightful region of Georgia, were Sir Francis Bathurst, his son, three daughters,
and servants; as also several relatives of the planters already settled there.[1]

[Footnote 1: SALMON'S Modern History, Vol. III. p. 602.]

I copy from Boyer's Political State of Great Britain,[1] the following particulars. "On the
13th of October, 1735, embarked on board the London Merchant, Captain Thomas, commander, fifty-six
men, women, and children, Saltzburgers, and some other persecuted protestants from Germany,
with Mr. Von Reck, who conducted from the same parts a former transport in 1733, and Captain
Hermsdorf, going to settle with their countrymen in Georgia. The charge of their subsistence
in their long journey from Ratisbon and Augsburg to Rotterdam, and from thence to London, and
their expense at London till they went on board, was defrayed by the Society for the propagation
of the Gospel in foreign Parts, out of the collections committed to them for that purpose."
Of this Society Oglethorpe was a member. The charge of their voyage to Georgia, with their
maintenance there for one year, and for the arms, utensils, and other necessary articles and
provisions which they took from hence with them, was defrayed by the honorable Trustees for
establishing the colony.

[Footnote 1: Vol. L. page 468.]

"The next day James Oglethorpe, Esq., set out by land for Gravesend, and the Reverend Mr. John
Wesley, Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, and the Reverend Mr. Charles Wesley, Student of
Christ's Church College, and the Reverend Mr. Ingham, of Queen's, went thither by water, in
order to embark on board the Symond, Captain Cornish, Commander; on board of which ship went
likewise a great number of poor English families, at the expense of the trustees; and soon
after these, two ships sailed together in company for Georgia. One of the above named clergymen
is to settle at the new town of Savannah, in that colony; and the other two intend, (after
some stay at Savannah, to learn the Indian language,) to devote themselves to preaching the
Gospel of our Saviour Jesus Christ to the Indian nations bordering upon that colony; which
might certainly be done with great effect, if men would but content themselves with inculcating
and enforcing the rational and plain doctrines taught by Christ himself, without pretending
to explain what have since been called the mysteries of the Christian religion, which serve
only to divide Christians among themselves, and have very much prevented the conversion of
heathens in all countries, and in all ages."

As the periodical publication, from which this paragraph is extracted, was the channel through
which official information respecting the settlement and affairs of Georgia was communicated,
the suggestion with which it is closed is to be understood as the opinion of the Trustees.
And when we recollect the character of those who composed the Board, it may be considered as
the dictate of sound judgment, and worthy of heedful observance.

The attention of Oglethorpe to the persons and condition of the emigrants, was assiduous, considerate,
and kind. "He had laid in a large quantity of live stock and various refreshments, though he
himself seldom eat any but ship's provisions. Not only the gentlemen, his friends, sat at his
table, but he invited, through the whole of the passage, the missionaries and the captain of
the ship, who, together made twelve in number."[1]

[Footnote 1: Moore's Voyage, p. II.]

They had prayers twice a day. The missionaries expounded the scriptures, catechized the children,
and administered the sacrament on Sundays; but, though the crew consisted of Episcopalians,
Methodists, German Lutherans, and Moravians, "Oglethorpe showed no discountenance to any for
being of different persuasions of religion."

"When occasion offered, he called together those who designed to be freeholders, and instructed
them in what manner to behave themselves, and acquainted them with the nature of the country,
and how to settle it advantageously. He constantly visited the sick, and let them have fowls
for broth, and any refreshments of his own; and administered medicine, personally, where it
was proper. Whenever the weather was calm enough to permit it, he went on board the London
Merchant, with which company was kept all the way, to see that the like care was taken of the
people there."[1]

[Footnote 1: Moore, p. 12.]

The Journal of Wesley gives many details of the voyage; but, as they relate principally to
the manner in which he and his brother and two friends spent their time, I pass them over,
but quote the following anecdote from one of his biographers.[1] "Mr. Wesley hearing an unusual
noise in the cabin of General Oglethorpe, stepped in to inquire the cause of it. On which the
General thus addressed him: 'Mr. Wesley you must excuse me. I have met with a provocation too
much for a man to bear. You know that the only wine I drink is Cyprus wine, as it agrees with
me the best of any. I therefore provided myself with several dozens of it, and this villain
Grimaldi' (his foreign servant, who stood trembling with fear,) 'has drunk up the whole of
it. But I will be revenged on him. I have ordered him to be tied hand and foot, and carried
to the man of war that sails with us. The rascal should have taken care not to have served
me so, for I never forgive.'--'Then I hope, sir,' (said Wesley, looking calmly at him) 'you
never sin.' The General was confounded at the reproof; and, putting his hand into his pocket,
took out a bunch of keys, which he threw at Grimaldi, saying, 'There, take my keys, and behave
better for the future!'"

[Footnote 1: Rev. HENRY MOORE, Vol. II. p. 258.]

While this was a happy verification of the remark of the wise man, that "a soft answer turneth
away wrath," it is a pleasing indication of the yielding placability of him to whom it was
addressed.--"The discretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to pass over
a transgression."

The ships, which bore this large accession to the Colony, passed the bar of the Tybee on the
afternoon of Thursday, February 5th, 1736, and came to anchor. This island is at the mouth
of the Savannah river; is five miles long, and three broad; and is the most easterly land in
the State. Oglethorpe went immediately on shore, to see what had been done towards raising
the beacon on the island, for the construction of which he had given orders. "It was to be
an octagon building of squared timber; its dimensions twenty-five feet wide at the bottom,
and ten at the top; and its height ninety feet, with a flag-staff on the top thirty feet high.
When completed, it would be of great service to all shipping, not only the vessels bound to
this port, but also to Carolina; for the land of the coast, for some hundred miles, is so alike,
being low and woody, that a distinguishing mark is of great consequence."[1]

[Footnote 1: MOORE's Voyage, p. 18.]

They had experienced a tempestuous voyage, and had a very rough passage; but now the weather
was fine; the land breezes refreshed them as the ships lay quietly moored; and they hailed
with delight the land of promise, the borders of which stretched before them; where, says Wesley,
"the groves of pines along the shores made an agreeable prospect, showing, as it were, the
verdure and bloom of spring in the depth of winter." A night of peaceful slumber passed; and,
about eight o'clock on Friday morning, they went ashore on a small uninhabited island,[1] where
Oglethorpe led them to a rising ground, and they all knelt and returned thanks to God for their
safe arrival. Leaving the people, as there was a fine spring, and a pond of pure water, to
wash their clothes, and refresh themselves, he went himself, attended by his suite, in a boat
to Savannah, where he was received, under the discharge of all their cannon, by the freeholders
in arms, with the constables and tithing men at their head. He introduced to them the clergymen
and gentlemen by whom he was accompanied; and congratulated the colonists on the religious
advantages which they were about to derive from these pious missionaries: and here they passed
the Sunday. Just three years had elapsed since the settlement commenced, and the celebration
of the anniversary on the opening week was rendered more observable and gladdening by the return
of the founder to share and grace the festivities of the occasion. But, amidst all the greetings
and inquiries of the throng around him, he was not unmindful of the new comers. He made it
his earliest care, as soon as the articles could be got ready, to send a boat with provisions
and refreshments for the people on board the ships and at the island; and soon after made them
a visit himself, and carried with him a still further supply of beef, pork, venison and wild
turkeys, together with soft bread, beer, turnips, and garden greens. This was not only peculiarly
relishing, after the salted sea-fare rations, but gratifying and encouraging, from the evidence
it gave that a settlement, begun only three years ago, by a people in circumstances like theirs,
could produce such plenty. And, while these attentions evinced the thoughtful regard of their
conductor to their comfort and welfare, they increased their sense of obligation, awakened
their gratitude, and strengthened their reliance.

[Footnote 1: Peeper Island.]

As Oglethorpe went round and visited the families in their dwellings, he was gratified with
perceiving what improvements had been made in the town, and its vicinity; that about two hundred
houses had been built, trees set out on the sides of the streets and public squares; and a
large garden laid out, and now under cultivation. This had engaged his early attention, and
was a favorite project, as of general interest and utility. It was situated at the east of
the town, on the sloping bank, and included the alluvial champaign below. It was laid out with
regularity and taste; and intended, primarily, to supply the settlers with legumes, culinary
roots, radishes and salads, till they could prepare homestead-plats for raising them. The principal
purpose, however, was for a nursery of white mulberry trees for the raising of silk worms;
and from which the people could be supplied with young trees, that all the families might be
more or less engaged in this reference to the filature. There was, also, a nursery coming on,
of apple, pear, peach, and plum trees, for transplantation. On the borders of the walks were
orange, olive, and fig-trees, pomegranates, and vines. In the more sunny part there was a collection
of tropical plants, by way of experiment, such as coffee, cacoa, cotton, &c. together with
some medicinal plants, procured by Dr. William Houston in the West Indies, whither he had been
sent by Sir Hans Sloane to collect them for Georgia. The expenses of this mission had been
provided by a subscription headed by Sir Hans, to which his Grace the Duke of Richmond, the
Earl of Derby, the Lord Peters, and the Apothecaries Company, liberally contributed. The Doctor
having died at Jamaica, the celebrated botanist, Philip Miller was now his successor.[1]

[Footnote 1: "Sir HANS SLOANE," says Dr. Pulteny, "was zealous in promoting the Colony of Georgia."
Historical and Biographical Sketch of the Progress of Botany in England, Vol. II. p. 85. See
a particular description of the garden, in MOORE's Voyage to Georgia, p. 30.]

All hands were now set to work, some to preparing houses, barracks, and lodgments for the new
comers; some to unlade the vessels and store the cargo, and some to extend the wharf. The General,
also, made a contract with persons for laying out and clearing the roads, and for making fortifications
at the south.

By none, perhaps, was his return more cordially welcomed than by Tomo Chichi and Toonahowi.
They brought with them two Indian runners, who had waited two months to give notice to the
lower and upper Creeks, of his arrival.

He received, also, the visit of a deputation from Purrysburgh, consisting of the Honorable
Hector Berenger de Beaufain and M. Tisley Dechillon, a patrician of Berne, with several other
Swiss gentlemen, to congratulate his return, and acquaint him with the condition of their settlement.

The United Brethren, or Moravians, as they were more usually called, who attended the other
exiled Protestants, began immediately their settlement near to Savannah. As soon as their personal
accommodation could be effected, they sought the acquaintance of Tomo Chichi, and his little
tribe; ingratiated themselves with these their neighbors, and, "with money advanced by General
Oglethorpe,"[1] built a school-house for the children. "This school was called Irene, and lay
not far from the Indian village."[2]

[Footnote 1: CARPZOVIUS, Examination of the Religion of the United Brethren, p. 417. See Appendix,
No. XVII.]

[Footnote 2: CRANZ'S History of the United Brethren, p. 226. It was opened on the 15th of September.]

The Baron Von Reck, who had been to Ebenezer, returned on the 8th of February, accompanied
with the Pastors Bolzius and Gronau, with the petition of the people for liberty to remove,
from the fords where they were, to a place ten miles to the east of their settlement, called
"Red-bluff," at the mouth of the river, where it enters the Savannah; and that those of their
community who had just arrived, instead of being destined to the southward, might be united
with them and enjoy the benefit of their religious instructers and guides. Before giving a
decisive answer, Oglethorpe deemed it proper to examine their situation, and confer with the
residents; and, not to keep them in suspense, especially as it was necessary to take immediate
measures for the accommodation of the new comers, agreed to accompany the applicants on their
return. Accordingly, he set out early on the appointed day, in the scout-boat, to the residence
of Sir Francis Bathurst, six miles above Savannah; and thence took horse, and passed by the
saw-mill set up by Mr. Walter Augustine, and, continuing his ride through the woods, arrived
that night at Ebenezer. On reconnoitring the place the next day, he found that the Saltzburgers
had constructed a bridge over the river, ten feet wide and eighty feet long; that four good
framed houses had been erected at the charge of the Trustees, one for each minister, one for
a schoolmaster, and one for a public store; and that a chapel, a guard-house, and a number
of split-board houses had been built by the people. All these, however, they were resolved
to forsake, and form a new settlement on the borders of the Savannah river. Their chief objection
to remaining was, that the land was not good, and that the corn-harvest had failed; yet they
acknowledged that they had a fine crop of peas, and many garden vegetables; that their cattle
thrived exceedingly, that they had plenty of milk, and fine poultry and eggs. He endeavored
to dissuade them from moving; but, finding their dissatisfaction with their present situation
to be so decided, he yielded to their importunity; ordered a town to be laid out; and gave
his unhesitating consent that the new comers should be incorporated with them. He then set
out for the Swiss settlement, where he arrived in the evening. He was received with the greatest
demonstrations of joy, and took lodgings at the house of Colonel Purry,[1] who had provided
a handsome entertainment for him.

[Footnote 1: John Peter Purry, formerly of Neufchatel.]

The chief purpose of his visit to this place was to engage a conveyance for the Honorable Charles
Dempsey to St. Augustine. This gentleman had come over with him in the Symond, having been
commissioned by the Spanish Minister in London to confer with the Governor of Florida on the
subject of the boundary between that country and Georgia, and to effect some provisional treaty
with General Oglethorpe.[1] A contract was made with Major Richard to conduct this gentleman
in a six-oared boat, being the best to be obtained, to his destination; and to be the bearer
of a letter from the General, expressing his wish to remove all misunderstanding and jealousy.

[Footnote 1: In the Impartial Inquiry, &c. p.84, is a deposition which thus begins--"CHARLES
DEMPSEY, of the Parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden, in the County of Middlesex, Esquire, aged
fifty-four years and upwards, maketh that in the year one thousand seven hundred and thirty-five,
this deponent went with the Honorable James Oglethorpe, Esq. to Georgia, in America, and was
sent from thence by the said Oglethorpe to St. Augustine with letters to the Governor there;
that this deponent continued going to and from thence until November, one thousand seven hundred
and thirty-six," &c.]

On his return to Savannah he sent forward Captain Hugh Mackay, Jr. with a company of rangers,
to travel by land to Darien, in order to make observations on the intervening country, to compute
the distance, and to judge of the practicability of a passable road; and Tomo Chichi furnished
them with Indian guides.

The next day he attended a military review; after which, he addressed the assembled people
in an animated speech, in which his congratulations, counsels, and good wishes were most affectionately
expressed. And he reminded them that, though it was yet "a day of small things," experience
must have strengthened the inducements to industry and economy, by shewing them that, where
they had been regarded, the result had been not only competence, but thrift.

He then took leave of them, and went down to the ships at Tybee.

As the destination of the large number of intended settlers, which had now arrived was "for
the purpose of laying out a county and building a new town near the southern frontier of Georgia,"
and the people were waiting to be conducted by the General to "the place of habitation," he
was very active in making arrangements for their transportation, and, on the evening of the
16th of February, 1739, set out in the scout-boat,[1] through the inward channels, to meet,
at Jekyl sound, a sloop that he had chartered to take on some of the more efficient men as
pioneers, and to make some preparation for the reception of the emigrants.[2] He took with
him Charles Wesley, who was to be his Secretary as well as Chaplain; Mr. Ingham having gone
by a previous opportunity; and left John Wesley and Delamotte at Savannah.[3]

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. XVIII.]

[Footnote 2: "The Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in America, ordered a new
town to be built in that Colony, and an embarkation to be made for that purpose."]

[Footnote 3: Many of the particulars in this chapter are taken from the Journal of THOMAS MOORE,
who was present. As that work is extremely rare, I adopted its information more verbally than
I should have done had I anticipated that it was so soon to be republished in the Collections
of the Georgia Historical Society.]

As Oglethorpe was in haste, the men rowed night and day, and had no other rest than what they
got when the wind favored their course; and "they vied with each other who should be forwardest
to please the General, who, indeed, lightened their sense of fatigue by giving them refreshments,
which he rather spared from himself than let them want."[1]

[Footnote 1: MOORE, p. 42.]

On the morning of the 18th they arrived at St. Simons, an island near the north mouth of the
Alatamaha river, fifteen miles in length, and from two to four in breadth. Here the working
men and carpenters who came in the sloop and long boats, disembarked, and were immediately
set to work.

Oglethorpe not only directed and superintended, but actually assisted in the labors. They soon
got up a house and thatched it with palmetto leaves; dug a cellar, and throwing up the earth
on each side, by way of bank, raised over it a store house; and then marked out a fort. They
next constructed several booths, each of which was between twenty and forty feet long, and
twenty feet wide. These were for the reception and temporary shelter of the Colonists.

After this, the General paid a visit to the Highlanders, at their settlement called "the Darien,"
a distance of sixteen miles on the northern branch of the Alatamaha. He found them under arms,
in their uniform of plaid, equipped with broad swords, targets, and muskets; in which they
made a fine appearance. In compliment to them, he was that morning, and all the time that he
was with them, dressed in their costume. They had provided him a fine soft bed, with Holland
sheets, and plaid curtains; but he chose to lie upon the ground, and in the open air, wrapt
in his cloak, as did two other gentlemen; and afterwards his example was followed by the rest
of his attendants. This condescending and accommodating disposition not only conciliated the
regards of the settlers, but encouraged them both by example and aid in going through their
arduous labors, and in submitting to the exigences of their situation. Happily his constitution
was framed to a singular temperament, which enabled him to require but very little sleep; and
he was capable of enduring long and frequent fasting, when imposed upon him either by necessity
or business, without any observable prejudice to his health, or any other inconvenience. A
gentleman, who was one of the party, in a letter, dated 24th of February, 1736, declares, "What
surprizes me, beyond expression, is his abstemiousness and hard living. Though even dainties
are plentiful, he makes the least use of them; and such is his hardiness, that he goes through
the woods wet or dry, as well as any Indian. Moreover, his humanity so gains upon all here,
that I have not words to express their regard and esteem for him." He further adds, "They have
a Minister here, Mr. McLeod, a very good man, who is very useful in instructing the people
in religious matters, and will intermeddle with no other affairs."[1] How commendably prudent,
as well as altogether proper, was this avoidance of secular topics and party discussions in
preaching; and how conducive to social accordance and peace, as well as spiritual edification,
was soon apparent in the lamentable effects of a different use of the ministerial function
in the other settlements.

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, 1736, p. 229.]

Having remained a few days with his favorite Highland corps, he returned to St. Simons, where
he found Tomo Chichi, Toonahowi, and a party of Indians consisting of about forty men, "all
chosen warriors and good hunters;" who had come down to show him what Islands they claimed
as having belonged to their nation, but which had been ceded to him by treaty, and to which
they would now give him the formal possession. To accomplish this, the General fitted out an
expedition, to take them with him in the two ten-oared boats, with Major Horton, Mr. Tanner,
and some other gentlemen as his escort; and a sufficient number of able hands both as boat-men
and soldiers, and to man the periagua,[1] with Highlanders under the command of Captain Hugh
Mackay. He the more readily engaged in this excursion from an impatient desire to gain intelligence
of Major Richard, and the deputation to St. Augustine.

[Footnote 1: The Periagua is a long flat-bottomed boat, carrying from twenty to thirty-five
tons. It is constructed with a forecastle and a cabin; but the rest is open, and there is no
deck. It has two masts, which the sailors can strike, and sails like those of schooners. It
is rowed, generally, with two oars only.]

They set out on the 18th of March. On the first day they visited an island in the mouth of
the Alatamaha, sixteen miles long, and from one to five broad; opposite the entrance of the
great Latilla river. By the Indians it was called WISSOE, Sassafras; but the Spaniards had
named it San Pedro. Toonahowi, pulling out a watch that had been given him by his Royal Highness
the Duke of Cumberland, desired that it should bear his name; saying, "He gave me this watch,
that we might know how time went; and we will remember him while time goes; and this place
must have his name, that others may be reminded of him." The General left Captain Mackay and
the Highlanders here, with directions to build a fort on the high ground, commanding the passes
of the river; which, at their desire, should be called St. Andrews. On the south-east part
of this island another strong fort was afterwards built, called Fort William, which commanded
Amelia Sound, and the inland passage from St. Augustine.

On their excursion, the next day, they passed the Clogothea, an arm of the Alatamaha, and went
ashore on a delightful island, about thirteen miles long, and two broad, with orange trees,
myrtles and vines growing on it. The wild-grape vines here, as on the borders of the Savannah,
grow to the very top of the trees, and hang from limb to limb in festoons, as if trimmed and
twined by art.[1] The name of this island, Santa Maria, they changed to AMELIA, in honor of
her Royal Highness.

[Footnote 1: Journal of the Rev. Mr. Bolzius, who, it seems, was one of the party. See URLSPURGER,
I. 845.]

On the third day they came to an island which had borne the name of San Juan; but claiming
it as belonging to his Majesty, and the southernmost part of his Provinces on the sea-coast
of North America, they named it GEORGE's.

As they approached the Spanish look-out, [Haser centinela] which is posted on the Florida side
of the St. John's river, the Indians shewed their desire of making an assault upon it, as "some
of them were related to those that had been killed, the winter before, by a detachment from
St. Augustine; and one of them, Poyeechy by name, had been wounded by the Spaniards." The General,
though with much difficulty, persuaded them to forbear; and prevailed upon them to return to
what is called "the Palmetto ground," near to Amelia Island, in one of the scout-boats, under
the care of Major Horton. When they had got entirely out of sight, he purposed to cross over
and inquire of the Spanish guard what had become of his boat and the commissioner to the Governor
of Florida.[1]

[Footnote 1: The district, as far as St. John's, was taken from the Spaniards in Queen Anne's
time; and at the time of the Peace of Utrecht it was in the possession of the English allied
Indians. Now, since by this treaty all lands in America were declared to belong to their then
present owners, and the said Indians still occupy it, and having acknowledged themselves subjects
to the King of Great Britain, by cession, the territory became his.]

On going ashore they found no men at the look-out, and therefore went down to the lower one,
which was also deserted. They then set out on their return, and passing between the St. George
and Talbot Island came to the rendezvous at the Palmetto ground. There they met Mr. Horton
in the scout-boat, and some boats of Indians; but Tomo Chichi, with two boats, was gone.

Here Mr. Moore, whom I follow, narrates a serio-comic adventure, which, though it may be, to
some of my readers, a twice-told tale, will bear repeating.

"About four hours in the night, their sentry challenged a boat, and Umpichi, one of those that
had been in England, answered, and at the same time leaped on shore with four others, and ran
up to the fires where Mr. Oglethorpe then was. They seemed in such a rage as is hardly to be
described. Their eyes glowed, as it were with fire. Some of them foamed at the mouth, and moved
with such bounds that they seemed rather possessed.

"Mr. Oglethorpe asked Umpichi what the matter was. He said 'Tomo Chichi has seen enemies, and
has sent us to tell it, and to help you.' Being asked why the Mico did not come back himself,
he said, 'He is an old warrior, and will not come away from his enemies, who hunt upon our
lands, till he has seen them so near as to count them. He saw their fire, and therefore sent
to take care of you, who are his friends. He will make a warrior of Toonahowi, and, before
daylight, will be revenged for his men whom they killed whilst he was gone to England. But
we shall have no honor, for we shall not be there.' The rest of the Indians seemed to catch
the raging fits, at not being present. Mr. Oglethorpe asked if he thought there were many.
He said 'Yes! he thought the enemies were a great many, for they had a great fire upon a high
ground, and the Indians never make large fires, but when they are so strong as to despise all
resistance.'

"Mr. Oglethorpe immediately ordered all his people on board, and they rowed very briskly to
where Tomo Chichi was; being about four miles distant.

"They found him, with his Indians, with hardly any fire, only a few sparks behind a bush, to
prevent discovery; who told them that they had been to see the fire, and had discovered seven
or eight white men, but the Indians, they believed, had encamped further in the woods, for
they had not seen them; but Tomo Chichi was going out again to look for the Indians, whom,
as soon as he discovered, he intended to give the signal to attack both the parties at once;
one half creeping near, and taking each their aim at those whom they saw most awake; and, as
soon as they had fired, to run in with their hatchets, and at the same time those who had not
fired to run in with their loaded arms; that if they knew once where the Indians were, they
would be sure of killing all the white men, since they, being round the fire, were easily seen,
and the same fire hindered them from seeing others.

"Mr. Oglethorpe tried to dissuade them from that attempt, but with great difficulty could obtain
of them to delay a little time; they thinking it argued cowardice. At last they got up and
resolved to go in spite of all his endeavors; on which he told them, 'You certainly go to kill
them in the night, because you are afraid of seeing them by day. Now, I do not fear them. Stay
till day, and I will go with you, and see who they are.'

"Tomo Chichi sighed, and sat down, and said, 'We do not fear them by day; but if we do not
kill them by night, they will kill you to-morrow.' So they stayed.

"By daybreak Mr. Oglethorpe and the Mico went down with their men, and came to the fire, which
they thought had been made by enemies, which was less than a mile from where the Mico had passed
the night. They saw a boat there, with a white flag flying, and the men proved to be Major
Richard, and his attendants, returned from Augustine.

"The Indians then seemed ashamed of their rage, which inspired them to kill men before they
knew who they were."

The meeting, under these circumstances, was doubly joyous. After mutual congratulations, he
was informed by Major Richard that "he was cast away before he could get to St. Augustine;
that part of the baggage was lost; but the boat and men saved. That, having scrambled through
the breakers, and walked some leagues through the sands, they were met by Don Pedro Lamberto,
a Captain of the horse, and by him conducted to the Governor, who received them with great
civility; and that the reason of his long stay was to get the boat repaired." He brought letters
from Don Francisco del Morale Sanchez, Captain General of Florida, and Governor of St. Augustine.
These commenced with compliments, thanking him for the letters brought by Charles Dempsey,
Esq. and Major Richard; which, however, were followed by complaints that the Creek Indians
had assaulted and driven away the Spanish settlers on the borders of the St. Mattheo,[1] and
intimations of displeasure at the threatening appearance of the forts which he was erecting,
and forces which manned them. Major Richard said that the Governor expected an answer in three
weeks, and desired him to bring it. He added, that despatches had been sent to the Havana to
apprize the Government of the arrival of the new settlers, and of the position which they had
taken.

[Footnote 1: The St. John's.]

"The same day they returned toward St. Andrew's; but not having depth of water enough through
the narrows of Amelia, the scout-boats were obliged to halt there; but the Indians advanced
to the south end of Cumberland, where they hunted, and carried venison to St. Andrews."

By the directions and encouragements of the General, the works at St. Simons were carried on
with such expedition, that, by the middle of April, the fort, which was a regular work of tabby,
a composition of oyster shells and lime, was finished; and thirty-seven palmetto houses were
put up, in which all the people might be sheltered till they could build better.

About the centre of the west end of the island, a town was laid out, which he called FREDERICA,
with wide streets, crossing each other at right angles. These were afterwards skirted with
rows of orange trees.

The ground being properly divided, "the people, who had now all arrived, having been brought
in a little fleet of periaguas, were put in possession of their respective lots, on the 19th
of April, in order that each man might begin to build and improve for himself. But the houses
that had been built, and the fields that had been tilled and sown, were, as yet, to be in common
for the public benefit."

At the south end of the island he caused to be erected a strong battery, called Fort St. Simons,
commanding the entrance to Jekyl sound; and a camp of barracks and some huts.

In point of situation, a better place for a town, a fortress, and a harbor, could hardly be
wished in that part of the country; lying, as it does, at the mouth of a very fine river. II.
p. 330, 2d ed. Lond. 1764. The best history, up to the date of publication, extant.]

On the 25th, Oglethorpe and his men, and Major Richard and his attendants, got back to Frederica.
On the next day the Indians arrived, the purpose of whose intended visit had been announced
by Tomo Chichi. Having encamped by themselves near the town, they prepared for a dance; to
which Oglethorpe went with all his people.

"They made a ring, in the middle of which four sat down, having little drums, made of kettles,
covered with deer skins, upon which they beat, and sung. Round these the others danced, being
naked to their waists, and having round their middle many trinkets tied with skins; and some
had the tails of beasts hanging down behind them. They had painted their faces and bodies;
and their hair was stuck with feathers. In one hand they had a rattle, in the other the feathers
of an eagle made up like the caduceus of Mercury; they shook there plumes and the rattle, and
danced round the ring with high bounds and antic postures, looking much like the figures of
the Satyrs.

"They showed great activity, and kept just time in their motions; and at certain times answered,
by way of chorus, to those that sat in the middle of the ring. They stopt; and then one of
the chief warriors stood out, who sang what wars he had been in, and described by motions as
well as by words, which way he had vanquished the enemies of his country. When he had done,
all the rest gave a shout of approbation, as knowing what he said to be true."[1]

[Footnote 1: MOORE.]

The Indian Mico then explained the object of their embassy in a long speech. After this, an
alliance was concluded, and presents exchanged; which consisted, on the part of the Indians,
of dressed skins; and, on that of Oglethorpe, of guns, red and blue cloth, powder, bullets,
knives, and small whetstones; and, among the women he distributed linen and woolen garments,
ear-rings, chains, beads, &c.

This business being despatched, the General called the freemen together, and communicated to
them the contents of the letters which he had received from the Governor of St. Augustine;
and this he did to prevent the ill impression that vague conjecture and idle reports might
occasion, and then, in compliance with the requisition of the Governor of St. Augustine that
hostile intrusion on the Spanish settlements might be prevented, he immediately fitted out
a periagua and the marine boat, with men and provisions for three months; together with arms,
ammunition, and tools, to sail to the southward, and cruise along the English side of the St.
John's, in order to detect and prevent any lawless persons from sheltering themselves there,
and thence molesting his Catholic Majesty's subjects, and to restrain the Indians.

This expedition was conducted by Captain Hermsdorff, who was to leave Major Richard and Mr.
Horton his attendant, at some place on the Florida shore, whence they could proceed to St.
Augustine to wait on the Governor with the despatches. The purport of these was to acquaint
him, that, "being greatly desirous to remove all occasions of uneasiness upon the frequent
complaints by his Excellency of hostile incursions upon the Spanish dominions, armed boats
had been sent to patrol the opposite borders of the river, and prevent all passing over by
Indians or marauders. The gentlemen were also directed to render him the thanks of General
Oglethorpe for his civilities, and to express his inclination for maintaining a good harmony
between the subjects of both crowns."[1]

[Footnote 1: MOORE'S Voyage, p. 79.]

On the 22d of May, 1736, a respectable deputation of the Uchee Indians, from the neighborhood
of Ebenezer, waited upon the General at St. Simons. They had painted themselves with various
colors, and were dressed in their richest costume. Being introduced to him in the large apartment
of the magazine store, the Indian King made a long speech; after which an alliance was entered
into, and pledge presents interchanged.[1] This treaty was a very important one, because the
Uchees claimed the country above Augusta to the border of the Creeks, and a portion below adjoining
the Yamacraws; because they were an independent tribe, having no alliance with the others;
and because they had been a little dissatisfied with the Saltzburgers at Ebenezer.

[Footnote 1: URLSPURGER, I. 844, and Appendix No. XIX.]

On the first of June intelligence was received that Major Richard and Mr. Horton, instead of
being received as commissioned delegates, had been arrested and made prisoners at St. Augustine.
Not explaining to the satisfaction of the Governor and his Council the situation of the forts
and the design of the military force that was stationed in them, they were detained in custody,
till Don Ignatio Rosso, Lieutenant Colonel of the garrison, with a detachment of men had made
personal investigations; who, after an absence of five days, returned and reported that the
islands were all fortified, and appeared to be filled with men; and that the shores were protected
by armed boats. A council of war was then held, and it was resolved to send back Major Richard
and Mr. Horton, and their suit, and with them an embassy, consisting of Charles Dempsey, Esq.,
Don Pedro Lamberto, Captain of the Horse, and Don Manuel D'Arcy, Adjutant of the garrison,
with intimations that this formidable array was unnecessary. By private information, however,
Oglethorpe was led to infer that, notwithstanding the fair professions that had been made by
the Spaniards, there were evidently measures concerted to increase their forces, to procure
guns and ammunition, and to arm the Florida Indians.[1]

[Footnote 1: MOORE'S Voyage, p. 79.]

In consequence of these and other indications that the Spaniards were commencing preparations
for dislodging the English settlers, the General took all possible precautionary measures for
repelling them. The fort and works on St. Simons were completed in the best manner, and a battery
was erected on the east point of the island, which projects into the ocean. This commanded
the entrance of Jekyl sound in such manner that all ships that come in at this north entry
must pass within shot of the point, the channel lying directly under it.

St. Andrew's fort, on Cumberland Island, with its munition of ordnance and garrison of well-disciplined
soldiers, was much relied upon as a mean of defence; and even the outpost at St. George's,
on the north side and near the mouth of St. John's river, was deemed of no inconsiderable importance
as a check, at least, upon any attempted invasion by the Spaniards, and as serving to prevent
their going through the inner passages.

In the month of July the General visited Savannah, to attend to affairs there, and to hold
a conference with a Committee of the General Assembly of South Carolina respecting the Indian
trade, which they charged him with aiming to monopolize, to the disallowance of their traders.

It may be necessary here to state, that, as the boundaries of Georgia separated the Indians
on the west side of the Savannah river from the confines of South Carolina, they must be admitted
as in affinity with the new Colony. At any rate, Oglethorpe deemed it so expedient to obtain
their consent to the settlement of his people, and their good will was so essential to a secure
and peaceful residence, that his earliest care had been to make treaties of alliance with them.
That these treaties should include agreements for mutual intercourse and trade, seemed to be,
not only a prudential, but an indispensable provision; particularly as Tomo Chichi and the
Micos of the Creeks, who went with him to England, had requested that some stipulations might
be made relative to the quantity, quality, and prices of goods, and to the accuracy of weights
and measures, in what was offered for the purchase of their buffalo hides, and deer-skins and
peltry.[1] Whereupon the Trustees proposed certain regulations of trade, designed to prevent
in future those impositions of which the Indians complained. To carry these into effect, it
was thought right that none should be permitted to trade with the Indians but such as had a
license, and would agree to conduct the traffic upon fair and equitable principles. The Carolina
traders, not being disposed to apply for a permit, nor to subject themselves to such stipulations
and restrictions, were disallowed by the Georgia Commissary, who held a trading house among
the Creeks.[2] This was resented by them, and their complaints to the Provincial Assembly led
to the appointment of the Committee just referred to, and whose conference with Oglethorpe
was held at Savannah on the 2d of August, 1736.[3] In their printed report they lay down these
fundamental principles. "The Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, and Catawba Indians, at the time of
the discovery of this part of America, were the inhabitants of the lands which they now possess,
and have ever since been deemed and esteemed the friends and allies of his Majesty's English
subjects in this part of the Continent. They have been treated with as allies, but not as subjects
of the crown of Great Britain; they have maintained their own possessions, and preserved their
independency; nor does it appear that they have by conquest lost, nor by cession, compact,
or otherwise, yielded up or parted with, those rights to which, by the laws of nature and nations,
they were and are entitled."

[Footnote 1: McCALL, Vol. I. p. 46.]

[Footnote 2: Capt. FREDERICK McKAY, in a letter to THOMAS BROUGHTON, Esq., Lieutenant Governor
of South Carolina, dated July 12,1735, written to justify his conduct as Indian Commissary,
in turning out four traders who would not conform to the rules stipulated in the licenses,
has the following remarks on the difficulties which he had to encounter: "It was impracticable
to get the traders to observe their instructions, while some did undersell the others; some
used light, others heavy weights; some bribed the Indians to lay out their skins with them,
others told the Indians that their neighboring traders had heavy weights, and stole their skins
from them, but that they themselves had light weights, and that their goods were better."]

[Footnote 3: "Report of the Committee appointed to examine into the proceedings of the people
of Georgia, with respect to the Province of South Carolina, and the disputes subsisting between
the two Colonies." 4to. Charlestown, 1736, p. 121.

This tract was printed by Lewis Timothy. There was no printer in Carolina before 1730, and
this appears to have been one of the earliest productions of the Charlestown press, in the
form of a book. RICH's Bibliotheca Americana Nova, p. 53.]

"The Committee cannot conceive that a charter from the crown of Great Britain can give the
grantees a right or power over a people, who, to our knowledge, have never owned any allegiance,
or acknowledged the sovereignty of the crown of Great Britain, or any Prince in Europe; but
have indiscriminately visited and traded with the French, Spaniards, and English, as they judged
it most for their advantage; and it is as difficult to understand how the laws of Great Britain,
or of any Colony in America, can take place, or be put in execution in a country where the
people never accepted of, nor submitted to, such laws; but have always maintained their freedom,
and have adhered to their own customs and manners without variation or change."

Hence the Committee inferred that the Regulations which were passed by the Trustees, could
not be binding upon the Indians, nor serve to effect any exclusive trade with them. Oglethorpe
acknowledged this independency of the Indians; and asserted that, in perfect consistency with
it, they had entered into a treaty of alliance with the Colony of Georgia; and, having themselves
indicated certain terms and principles of traffic, these were adopted and enjoined by the Trustees;
and this was done, not to claim authority over the Indians, nor to control their conduct, but
to indicate what was required of those who should go among them as traders.

In answer to the allegations that the Carolina traders had been excluded, he declared that,
in granting licenses to trade with the Indians, he refused none of the Carolina traders who
conformed to the Act, and gave them the same instructions as had been given by the Province
of Carolina.[1] He also declared that he had given, and should always continue to give, such
instructions to the Georgia traders, as had formerly been given by the Province of South Carolina
to theirs; and in case any new instructions given by the Province of South Carolina to their
traders shall be imparted, and appear to him for the benefit of the two Provinces, he would
add them to the instructions of the Georgia traders; and, finally, that, pursuant to the desire
of the Committee, he would give directions to all his officers and traders among the Indians,
in their talk and discourses to make no distinction between the two Provinces, but to speak
in the name and behalf of his Majesty's subjects[2].

[Footnote 1: "To protect the natives against insults, and establish a fair trade and friendly
intercourse with them, were regulations which humanity required, and sound policy dictated.
But the rapacious spirit of individuals could be curbed by no authority. Many advantages were
taken of the ignorance of Indians in the way of traffic." RAMSAY's History of South Carolina,
Vol. I. p. 48. For other particulars stated by him, respecting the trade with the Indians,
see p. 89,104.]

[Footnote 2: Report of the Committee, &c., p. 106, 107.]

It seems, however, that the Committee were not satisfied; primarily because licenses were required,
and especially that they must come through the hands of the Governor of Georgia.

In a few days after this conference Oglethorpe returned to Frederica. On the latter part of
September he renewed the commission of the Honorable Charles Dempsey, impowering him to state
to the Governor of St. Augustine terms for a conventional adjustment of the misunderstanding
between the two Provinces. This he eventually effected, and a treaty was concluded on the 27th
of October following, much more conciliatory, on the part of the Spaniards, than he had expected.
This, however, proved ineffectual, and the pleasing anticipations of restored harmony which
it seemed to authorize, were shortly frustrated by a message from the Governor of St. Augustine
to acquaint him that a Spanish Minister had arrived from Cuba, charged with a communication
which he desired an opportunity of delivering in person. He refused to listen to any argument
in support of the English claim, or to admit the validity of the treaty which had lately been
signed, declaring that it had erred in the concessions which had been made. He then unceremoniously
departed, with a repetition of his demand, accompanied with menaces.

Perceiving that the most vigorous measures, and a stronger defensive force than the Province
could supply, would be necessary to overawe the hostile purposes displayed by Spain, or repel
them if put in execution, Oglethorpe resolved to represent the state of affairs to the British
Ministers, and straightway embarking, set sail for England.[1] He arrived at the close of the
year; and, presenting himself before the Board of Trustees, "received an unanimous vote of
thanks, as he had made this second, as well as his first expedition to Georgia, entirely at
his own expense."[2]

[Footnote 1: HEWATT, II. 47, and GRAHAM, III.

In order to show circumstantially the progress of colonization, by following Oglethorpe with
his new and large accession of emigrants and military forces to their destined places of settlement
on the borders of the Alatamaha and the southern islands, all mention of the reception and
treatment of the Wesleys, whom he had brought over as religious missionaries, has been deferred.
The relation is introduced now, as a kind of episode.

The delegation of these pious evangelists was encouraged by flattering suggestions, and acceded
to with the most raised expectations; and its objects were pursued by them with untiring zeal
and unsparing self-devotedness, through continual hindrances. The opposition which they met
was encountered with "all long-suffering and patience;" but their best efforts were unavailing;
"and their mission closed, too speedily, in saddened disappointment."

I. JOHN WESLEY, though stationed at Savannah, did not consider himself so much a Minister to
the inhabitants as a missionary to the Indians. Whenever he mentioned his uneasiness at being
obstructed in his main design, he was answered "You cannot leave Savannah without a Minister."
To this he rejoined, "My plain answer is, I know not that I am under any obligations to the
contrary. I never promised to stay here one month. I openly declared, both before, and ever
since my coming hither, that I neither would nor could take charge of the English any longer
than till I could go among the Indians." It was rejoined, "But did not the Trustees of Georgia
appoint you to be Minister at Savannah?" He replied, "They did; but it was done without either
my desire or knowledge. Therefore I cannot conceive that that appointment could lay me under
any obligation of continuing here longer than till a door is opened to the Heathen; and this
I expressly declared at the time I consented to accept that appointment[1]."

[Footnote 1: Life of Rev. JOHN WESLEY, A.M., in which is included the Life of his Brother CHARLES
WESLEY, A.M. By Rev. HENRY MOORE. Lond. 1824, 2 vols. 8vo. Vol. I. p. 310.]

Oglethorpe had been so impressed with what he had seen of the natives, that he had written
home that "a door seemed opened for the conversion of the Indians." These favorable expectations
were greatly increased by the visit to England of Tomo Chichi and his train. They seemed to
be fully authorized by the declarations which were made by them to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and other clergy; and they appeared to be put in a train of accomplishment by the interest
taken for facilitating that purpose by the manual of instruction for the Indians which was
preparing by Bishop Wilson. But when Tomo Chichi came to welcome the Governor on his arrival,
and was introduced to the intended teacher, it appeared that unforeseen obstacles had arisen.
"I am glad you are come," said the Mico, addressing him through the female interpreter. "When
I was in England I desired that some would speak the great word to me; and our people then
desired to hear it; but now we are all in confusion. The French on one side, and the Spanish
on the other, and the Traders in the midst, have caused us much perplexity; and made our people
unwilling. Their ears are shut. Their tongues are divided, and some say one thing, and some
another. But I will call together our chiefs, and speak to the wise men of our nation, and
I hope they will hear. But we would not be, made Christians as the Spaniards make Christians.
We would be taught; and then, when we understand all clearly, be baptized."[1] There was good
sense in this remark. They would be informed of the evidences of the truth of Christianity,
and have its principles and doctrines explained to them, and its precepts, tendency, and design
illustrated; and hence be enabled to adopt it from conviction. This they would do, when they
were made to understand how it was a divine revelation, and saw its effects in the life of
its professors. But the reply of Wesley was not simple enough to be comprehended by him. It
was this; "There is but one,--He that sitteth in the heaven,--who is able to teach man wisdom.
Though we are come so far, we know not whether He will please to teach you by us, or no. If
He teaches you, you will learn wisdom; but we can do nothing." All the inference which the
poor Indian could draw from this was, that he who had come as a religious teacher disclaimed
his own abilities, and referred to a divine Instructer, of whom the Mico could know nothing
as yet, by whom alone the converting knowledge was to be communicated.

[Footnote 1: Account of the Settlement of the Saltzburg Emigrants at Ebenezer, in Georgia.
By Philip George Frederic von Reck. Hamburgh, 1777. 12mo, p. 7.]

Moreover, he had been an observer of the disposition and conduct of those who called themselves
Christians; and, at another interview with Wesley, when urged to listen to the doctrines of
Christianity, and become a convert, he keenly replied, "Why these are Christians at Savannah!
Those are Christians at Frederica!" Nor was it without good reason that he exclaimed, "Christians
drunk! Christians beat men! Christians tell lies! Me no Christian."

Scenawki, however, had more courtesy. She presented the Missionaries with two large jars of
honey, and one of milk; and invited them to come up to Yamacraw, and teach the children, saying,
the honey represented the inclination of the people there, and the milk the need of their children.
What a beautiful illustration of the mode of teaching practised by the Apostle! "I have fed
you with milk, and not with meat;" adapting the instruction to the capacity of those to whom
it was imparted, and "as they were able to receive it," could properly digest it, "and be nourished
thereby."

Other conferences effected little; and as Mrs. Musgrove did not reside at Yamacraw, and could
not often assist him as an interpreter; and, perhaps, could not readily make perspicuous in
the Indian dialect what was somewhat more mystical than even his English hearers could comprehend,
his cherished purposes for the conversion of the Indians seemed to be thwarted. Besides, the
condition of the people at Savannah was such as to require clerical services, and he gave himself
wholly to them.

For some time his labors as a preacher promised to be successful; "and all would have been
well," says Southey, "could he but have remembered the advice of Dr. Burton." This was contained
in a letter addressed to him a few days before embarking for Georgia. Among other things, this
excellent friend suggested to him that, under the influence of Mr. Oglethorpe, giving weight
to his endeavors, much may be effected in the present undertaking; and goes on to remark; "With
regard to your behavior and manner of address, these must be determined according to the different
circumstances of persons, &c.; but you will always, in the use of means, consider the great
end; and, therefore, your applications will of course vary. You will keep in view the pattern
of the Gospel preacher, St. Paul, who 'became all things to all men, that he might save some.'
Here is a nice trial of christian prudence. Accordingly, in every case you will distinguish
between what is indispensable, and what is variable; between what is divine, and what is of
human authority. I mention this, because men are apt to deceive themselves in such cases; and
we see the traditions and ordinances of men frequently insisted on with more rigor than the
commandments of God, to which they are subordinate. Singularities of less importance, are often
espoused with more zeal than the weighty matters of God's law. As in all points we love ourselves,
so, especially, in our hypotheses. Where a man has, as it were, a property in a notion, he
is most industrious to improve it, and that in proportion to the labor of thought he has bestowed
upon it; and, as its value rises in imagination, he is, in proportion, unwilling to give it
up, and dwells upon it more pertinaciously than upon considerations of general necessity and
use. This is a flattering mistake, against which we should guard ourselves."

Unmindful of such counsel, the eagerness of Wesley to effect reformation was pressed too precipitately
and carried too far. His sermons had such direct reference, not only to the state of affairs,
but the conduct of individuals, that they were shrunk from as personal allusions. His zeal
was excessive, and his practice exclusive.[1]

[Footnote 1: Mr. SOUTHEY has this remark--"He was accused of making his sermons so many satires
upon particular persons; and for this cause his auditors fell off; for though one might have
been very well pleased to hear others preached at, no person liked the chance of being made
the mark himself."--Moreover, "following the rubric, in opposition to the practice of the English
church, he insisted upon baptizing children by immersion, and refused to baptize them if the
parents did not consent to this rude and perilous method. Some persons he would not receive
as sponsors, because they were not communicants; and when one of the most pious men in the
Colony earnestly desired to be admitted to the communion, he refused to admit him because he
was a Dissenter, unless he would be rebaptized. And he would not read the burial service over
another for the same reason, or one founded on the same principle." Life of WESLEY, by ROBERT
SOUTHEY, New York edition, 1820. Vol. I. p. 108.--Instances of personal reference in preaching,
and of its alienating effects, are mentioned by Mr. Stevens, in his Journal, Vol. I. pp. 15,
19, and elsewhere.]

For these and other reasons, and in some respects most unreasonably, the people at Savannah
became prejudiced against him, and so disaffected that "he perceived that his preaching was
not likely to be attended with beneficial influence. Hence, having in vain sought an accommodation
with his opponents, without in the least relaxing from the enforcement of his principles, and
disappointed in the prime object of his mission, that of preaching to the Indians, he resolved
to quit the Colony, and return to his native land[1]."

[Footnote 1: Memoir of the Rev. John Wesley, prefixed to a volume of his Sermons, by Samuel
Drew, page xvi.]

Another circumstance brought the whole scene of his trials to a catastrophe. Sophia Hopkins,
the niece of Mrs. Causton, wife of Thomas Causton, Esq., chief magistrate of the place, had
been a pupil to him to learn French, was a professed convert to his ministry, and become a
member of the Church. Her beauty, accomplishments, and manners, were fascinating; and she appears,
by some coquettish advances, to have won his affections. Delamotte, however, doubting the sincerity
of her pretensions to piety, cautioned his friend Wesley against cherishing a fond attachment.
The Moravian Elders, also, advised him not to think of a matrimonial connection. In consequence
of this, his conduct towards her became reserved and distant; very naturally, to her mortification;
though her own affections had been preëngaged, for she soon after married a Mr. Williamson.
But a hostile feeling had been excited against him by her friends, for the manifestation of
which an opportunity was afforded about five months after her marriage. Wesley having discovered
in her conduct several things which he thought blameworthy, with his wonted ingenuousness,
frankly mentioned them to her; intimating that they were not becoming a participant of the
Lord's Supper. She, in return, became angry. For reasons, therefore, which he stated to her
in a letter, he cautioned her not to come to the ordinance till she could do it in a reconciled
temper.

The storm now broke forth upon him. A complaint was entered to the magistrates; an indictment
filed, and a warrant issued, by which he was brought before the Recorder, on the charges of
Mr. Williamson,--1st, That he had defamed his wife; and, 2dly, That he had causelessly repelled
her from the Holy Communion. Wesley denied the first charge; and the second, being wholly ecclesiastical,
he would not acknowledge the authority of the magistrate to decide upon it. He was, however,
told that he must appear before the next court, to be holden at Savannah, August term, 1737.
In the mean time pains were taken by Mr. Causton to pack and influence the jury. There were
debates and rude management in the court. No pleas of defence were admitted. The evidence was
discordant. Twelve of the grand jurors drew up a protest against the proceedings. The magistrates,
themselves, after repeated adjournments, could come to no decision; and justice was not likely
to be awarded. Wearied with this litigious prosecution, Wesley applied to his own case the
direction given by our Lord to his Apostles, "If they persecute thee in one place, flee unto
another;" and, shaking off the dust of his feet as a witness against them, he fled to Charlestown,
South Carolina; whence, on Thursday, the 22d of December, 1737, he embarked for England. After
a pleasant passage, he landed at Deal, February, 1738, as he remarks, "on the anniversary festival
in Georgia, for Mr. Oglethorpe's landing there." As he entered the channel, on his return,
Mr. Whitefield sailed through it, on a mission; not to be his coadjutor, as he expected, but,
as it proved, his successor.

II. The situation of CHARLES WESLEY was annoyed by like discomfitures, and followed by still
greater disappointment. He had received the most flattering accounts of Georgia from the conversation
of Oglethorpe, with whom he had been for some time acquainted; and from the little book which
this gentleman had published. Implicitly confiding in the high wrought descriptions which had
been given him, and indulging anticipations of a colonization of more than Utopian excellence,
he attended his brother to Georgia, and attached himself to Oglethorpe, whose warm professions
had won him to his service both as Secretary and Chaplain.

His destination was to the new settlement at Frederica; and there he arrived, with his patron,
on the 9th of March, 1736. The first person who saluted him, as he stept on shore, was Ingham,
his intimate, confidential, and highly valued friend; who had preceded him thither. The meeting
was truly pleasant; but what he learned from him of the state of affairs there, and of "the
treatment which he had met for vindicating the sanctity of the Lord's day," was a saddening
indication of the reverse which his cherished anticipations were soon to meet. He was apprised
by it, however, of the necessity of taking measures for procuring a more sober observance of
the Sabbath in future. Accordingly, as he had been announced to the settlers as their religious
instructer and guide, he spent the remainder of the week in visits to their families, and in
seeking that personal acquaintance with them, without which, he well knew that general instruction
would be of little use; but, he observes, "with what trembling should I call this flock mine!"
In the evening he read prayers, in the open air; at which Oglethorpe was present. 3]

In the public discharge of his duties as a clergyman, he was solemn and fervent; and his preaching
evinced "how forcible are right words." But in his daily intercourse with this heterogeneous
population, he was not always aware that clerical intimacy should never descend to familiarity.
He overheard rude speeches and gossipping tattle; and was made acquainted with some domestic
bickerings and feuds; and kindly, though not always discretely, endeavored to check them; but
his mediation was repelled as uncalled-for interference.[1] To use the words of his biographer,
"he attempted the doubly difficult task of reforming the gross improprieties, and reconciling
some of the petty jealousies and quarrels with each other; in which he effected little else
than making them unite in opposing him, and caballing to get rid of him in any way."[2] Hence
complaints were made to Oglethorpe, who, instead of discountenancing them decidedly, and vindicating,
or at least upholding him whom he had brought over, and placed in an office where he ought
to have demanded for him a treatment of deference and respect, himself listened too readily
to complaints and invectives, and suffered them to prejudice him against the truly amiable,
ingenuous, and kind-hearted minister. Instead of putting candid constructions on well-meant
purposes, of cautioning his inexperience, or giving friendly advice, he treated him with coldness
and neglect.[3] The only apology for this is that suggested by Southey.[4] "The Governor, who
had causes enough to disquiet him, arising from the precarious state of the Colony, was teased
and soured by the complaints which were perpetually brought against the two brothers, and soon
began to wish that he had brought with him men of more practicable tempers." In some hours
of calmer reflection, however, he felt the compunctious visitings of conscience, and convinced
of the injustice which he had done to Mr. Wesley, "in the most solemn manner he professed to
him his regret for his unkind usage; and, to express his sincerity, embraced and kissed him
with the most cordial affection." Realizing, however, that the situation of this aggrieved
and disheartened man was such that his usefulness here was at an end, and finding it necessary
to make a special communication to the Trustees, relative to the internal distractions among
the first settlers; to the Board of Trade on the subject of exports and commercial relations;
and to the Government, respecting the exposed situation of the Colony, he commissioned him
to carry the despatches.

[Footnote 1: "He that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one
that taketh a dog by the ears." Proverbs, XXVI. 17. He who inconsiderately engages in other
men's quarrels, whom he lights upon by chance, and in which he is not concerned, will assuredly
suffer by his interference.]

[Footnote 4: Life of Wesley, Vol. I. p. 107.]

On the 26th of July, 1736, he set out for Charlestown, to take passage to England; and, on
the 16th of August, went on board the London Galley. But the passengers and sailors soon found
that the Captain, while on shore, had neglected every thing to which he ought to have attended.
The vessel was too leaky to bear the voyage; and the Captain drinking nothing scarcely but
gin, had never troubled his head about taking in water; so that they were soon reduced to short
allowance, which, in that sultry clime and season of the year, was a distressing predicament.
Meeting, too, with violent squalls of wind, they were driven off their course. The leak became
alarming, and their troubles increased so fast upon them, that they were obliged to steer for
Boston in New England; where they arrived, with much difficulty and danger, on the 2d of September.

Wesley was soon known at Boston; and met a hospitable reception among the Ministers, both of
the town and neighborhood. In a letter to his brother, he thus describes the attentions that
were paid to him. "I am wearied with this hospitable people; they so teaze me with their civilities.
They do not suffer me to be alone. The clergy, who come from the country on a visit, drag me
with them when they return[1]. I am constrained to take a view of this New England, more pleasant
even than the Old. And, compared with the region in which I last resided, I cannot help exclaiming,
O happy country that breeds neither flies, nor crocodiles, nor prevaricators!"[2]

[Footnote 1: Referring to the weekly assembling of the Clergy from the neighboring towns to
attend the Thursday Lecture.]

[Footnote 2: Having found that letters to his brother were intercepted and read, before they
were delivered, he wrote sometimes in Latin, and even passages in Greek. This, dated Boston,
October 5th, 1736, was in Latin, and I give the extract here, of which the text is a translation.
"Tsedet me populi hujuser, ita me urbanitate sua divexant et persequuntur. Non patientur me
esse solum. E rure veninnt Clerici; me revertentes in rare trahant. Cogor henc Anglicum contemplari,
etiam antiquâ amoeniorem; et nequeo non exclamare, O fortinata regio, nec muscas aleus, nec
crocodilos, nec delatores!" [When Mr. C. Wesley was at Frederica, the sand-flies were one night
so exceedingly troublesome, that he was obliged to rise at one o'clock, and smoke them out
of his hut. He tells us that the whole town was employed in the same way. By crocodile he means
the species called alligator. When at Savannah, he and Mr. Delamotte used to bathe in the river
between four and five o'clock in the morning, before the alligators were stirring, but they
heard them snoring all round them. One morning Mr. Delamotte was in great danger; an alligator
rose just behind him, and pursued him to the land, whither he escaped with difficulty.]]

The repairs of the vessel detained him here till the 15th of October, when they sailed. They
had a most perilous passage, and encountered violent storms; but on the third of December arrived
opposite Deal; and the passengers went safe on shore.

III. INGHAM had his station assigned him at Frederica; and there his prudence preserved him
from the vexations with which his cherished companion was annoyed. In behalf of that persecuted
and dispirited friend, he went to Savannah, to inform John Wesley of the opposition of the
people to his brother. He tarried there to supply John's place during his absence on the visit
of sympathy and counsel, of mediation or rescue. Returning to Frederica, he remained there
till the 13th of May, when he accompanied Charles to Savannah, whither he went to receive the
Indian traders on their coming down to take out their licenses. He accompanied them to the
upper Creeks; among whom he resided several months, and employed himself in making a vocabulary
of their language, and composing a grammar.[1]

[Footnote 1: SOUTHEY, I. 122, note; mention is also made of him in CRANZ'S History of the United
Brethren, p. 228.]

On the 24th of February, 1737, it was agreed that he should go to England, and "endeavor to
bring over, if it should please God, some of their friends to strengthen their hands in his
work."[1] By him John Wesley wrote to Oglethorpe, who had sailed for England, and to Dr. Brady's
associates, who had sent a library to Savannah.

[Footnote 1: MOORE'S Lives of the Wesleys, I. 315.]

Ingham is mentioned by Whitefield, in terms of high regard, as fellow-laborer with the Wesleys,
and "an Israelite indeed."

IV. DELAMOTTE remained, from the first, with John Wesley at Savannah. He kept a school, in
which he taught between thirty and forty children to read, write, and cast accounts. "Before
public worship on the afternoon of the Lord's day, he catechized the lower class, and endeavored
to fix some things of what was said by the Minister in their understandings as well as their
memories. In the morning he instructed the larger children."[1]

[Footnote 1: Here is a prototype of the modern Sunday-schools.]

He returned to England in the Whitaker, Captain Whiting; the ship that brought out Mr. Whitefield,
June 2d, 1738. "The good people lamented the loss of him, and great reason had they to do so;
and went to the waterside to take a last farewell."

V. GEORGE WHITEFIELD was the intimate friend of the Wesleys and of Ingham; and he states, in
his Journal, that when they were in Georgia he received letters from them; and that their description
of the moral condition of the Colony affected his heart powerfully, and excited a strong desire
to join them, to assist them in the work in which they were occupied, and become "a partaker
with them in the afflictions of the gospel." Such an undertaking was suited to his energetic
and enterprizing character; and therefore engaged much of his attention. On the return of Charles
Wesley to England, he learned more of the situation of the Colonists, and of their great need
of religious instruction; and when Ingham came with special reference to procuring assistance,
he expressed his readiness to go on the mission. In the letter which he received by him from
John Wesley was this direct reference, "Only Delamotte is with me, till God shall stir up the
heart of some of his servants, who, putting their lives in his hands, shall come over and help
us, where the harvest is so great and the laborers are so few. What if thou art the man, Mr.
Whitefield? Do you ask me what you shall have? Food to eat and raiment to put on; a house to
lay your head in, such as your Lord had not; and a crown of glory that fadeth not away!" This,
and another letter, strengthened the desire, which soon ripened into a purpose, for which all
circumstances seemed favorable. Charles, too, became more explicit, and rather urged his going[1].

[Footnote 1: He addressed a poem to him in which are these verses:

  "Servant of God! the summons hear.
    Thy Master calls! arise! obey!
  The tokens of his will appear,
    His providence points out the way.

  "Champion of God! thy Lord proclaim,
    Jesus alone resolve to know.
  Tread down thy foes in Jesus' name,
    And conquering and to conquer go!"]

He accordingly went up to London to tender his services to Oglethorpe and the Trustees; by
whom he was accepted; and he left London on the latter part of December, 1737, in the 23d year
of his age, to take passage in the Whitaker, Captain Whiting, master, on a voyage to Georgia.
It was, however, the end of January before the vessel was fairly on its way, in consequence
of contrary winds. They sailed from the Downs a few hours only before the vessel, which brought
Wesley back, cast anchor there. He was attended on his passage by the Honorable James Habersham
and his brother. They landed, after rather a circuitous and long passage, on the 7th of May,
1738. Delamotte, whom Wesley had left schoolmaster at Savannah, received him at the Parsonage
house, which he found much better than he expected. Having met with some of his predecessor's
converts there, he read prayers on the morrow, and expounded, in the Court-house, and waited
on the magistrates; but, being taken ill of a fever and ague, he was confined to the house
for a week.

Being informed that Tomo Chichi was sick, nigh unto death, as soon as he could venture abroad
he made him a visit. The Mico lay on a blanket, thin and meagre. Scenawki, his wife, sat by,
fanning him with feathers. There was none who could speak English, so that Mr. Whitefield could
only shake hands with him and leave him. A few days after he went again, and finding Toonahowi
there, who could speak English, "I desired him," says Whitefield, "to ask his uncle whether
he thought he should die;" who answered, "I cannot tell." I then asked, where he thought he
should go, after death? He replied "To heaven." But alas! a further questioning led the solemn
visiter to an unfavorable opinion of his preparedness for such a state of purity.

When Whitefield had recovered so as to commence his labors, he remarked that every part bore
the aspect of an infant colony; that, besides preaching twice a day, and four times on the
Lord's day, he visited from house to house, and was in general cordially received, and always
respectfully; "but from time to time found that caelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt.
'Those who cross the seas, change their climate, but not their disposition.'" Though lowered
in their circumstances, a sense of what they formerly were in their native country remained.
It was plainly to be seen that coming over was not so much a matter of choice as of restraint;
choosing rather to be poor in an unknown country abroad, than to live among those who knew
them in more affluent circumstances at home.[1]

[Footnote 1: Gillies' Memoirs of Whitefield, p. 27.]

The state of the children affected him deeply. The idea of an Orphan-House in Georgia had been
suggested to him by Charles Wesley, before he himself had any thought of going abroad; and
now that he saw the condition of the Colonists, he said, "nothing but an orphan-house can effect
the education of the children." From this moment he set his heart upon founding one, as soon
as he could raise funds. In the meantime, he did what he could. He opened a school at Highgate
and Hampstead, and one for girls at Savannah. He then visited the Saltzburgers' orphan-house
at Ebenezer; and, if any thing was wanting to perfect his own design, or to inflame his zeal,
he found it there. The Saltzburgers themselves were exiles for conscience' sake, and eminent
for piety and industry. Their ministers, Gronau and Bolzius, were truly evangelical. Their
asylum, which they had been enabled to found by English benevolence for widows and orphans,
was flourishing. Whitefield was so delighted with the order and harmony of Ebenezer that he
gave a share of his own "Poor's store" to Bolzius for his orphans. Then came the scene which
completed his purpose. Bolzius called all the children before him, and catechized them, and
exhorted them to give God thanks for his good providence towards them. Then prayed with them,
and made them pray after him. Then sung a psalm. Afterwards, says Whitefield "the little lambs
came and shook me by the hand, one by one, and so we parted." From this moment Whitefield made
his purpose his fate.[1]

[Footnote 1: PHILLIPS' Life and Times of Whitefield, p. 73.]

As opportunity offered he visited Frederica, and the adjacent settlements; and says that he
often admired that, considering the circumstances and disposition of the first settlers, so
much was really done. He remarks that "the first settlers were chiefly broken and decayed tradesmen
from London and other parts of England; and several Scotch adventurers, (Highlanders) who had
a worthy minister named Macleod; a few Moravians, and the Saltzburgers, who were by far the
most industrious of the whole;" and he adds, that he would cheerfully have remained with them,
had he not felt obliged to return to England to receive priest's orders, and make a beginning
towards laying a foundation of the orphan-house, which he saw was much wanted.

In August he settled a schoolmaster, leaving Mr. Habersham at Savannah; and, parting affectionately
with his flock, he went to Charlestown, South Carolina, and, on the 9th of September, went
aboard the Mary, Captain Coe, for England, where he arrived in the latter part of November, 1738.

The Trustees for the Colony received him cordially; were pleased to express their satisfaction
at the accounts which had been sent them of his conduct and services during his stay in the
Colony; and having been requested by letters sent, unknown to him, from the magistrates and
inhabitants, they most willingly presented to him the living of Savannah, (though he insisted
upon having no salary), and as readily granted him five hundred acres of land, whereon to erect
an Orphan-House, and make a garden and plantations; to collect money for which, together with
taking priest's orders, were the chief motives of his returning to England so soon[1].

[Footnote 1: GILLIES, p. 32.]

Without extending the account of this zealous, eloquent, and popular preacher any further,
suffice it to say that he was greatly successful in the object of his visit, and his appeals
to public charity in behalf of the Orphan-House; that he returned to Georgia, and on March
11th, 1742, laid the foundation of that edifice; and, both in America and in England, continued
his measures for its establishment, till he saw it completed.

"At a meeting of the Trustees of Georgia, Wednesday, January 19th, 1737, Mr. Oglethorpe, newly
returned hither, had the unanimous thanks of the board. He informed them that Savannah had
greatly increased in building, and that three other towns had been founded within a year; namely,
Augusta, Darien, and Frederica; that a new town, called Ebenezer, had been laid out for the
Saltzburgers; and that there were several villages settled by gentlemen at their own expense.
He gave them the pleasing intelligence that the remoter Creek nation acknowledged his Majesty's
authority, and traded with the new settlers; and that the Spanish Governor-General and Council
of War of Florida had signed a treaty with the Colony."[1] He added, however, that notwithstanding
these seeming auspicious circumstances, the people on the frontiers were in constant apprehensions
of an invasion, and that he had strong suspicions that the treaty would not be regarded; that
the Spanish government at Cuba was wholly opposed to it; and that the indignant demand of the
commissioner from Havana, and the threat which followed, implied an infraction, and would lead
to consequences against which it was necessary to provide.

[Footnote 1: Extract from the Record of the Trustees, published in the Gentleman's Magazine,
for 1737, Vol. XII. p. 59.]

Upon this communication some able remarks were made in the London Post. They were introduced
by a statement of the benefits likely to accrue to the English nation from settling the colony
of Georgia; and go on to mention that the colony was in the most thriving condition in consequence
of royal patronage and parliamentary aid, seconded by the generosity of contributors, "whose
laudable zeal will eternize their names in the British annals; and, carried into effect under
the conduct of a gentleman, whose judgment, courage, and indefatigable diligence in the service
of his country, have shewn him every way equal to so great and valuable a design. In the furtherance
of this noble enterprise, that public spirited and magnanimous man has acted like a vigilant
and faithful guardian, at the expense of his repose, and to the utmost hazard of his life.
And now, the jealousy of the Spanish is excited, and we are told that that court has the modesty
to demand from England that he shall not he any longer employed. If this be the fact, as there
is no doubt it is, we have a most undeniable proof that the Spaniards dread the abilities of
Mr. Oglethorpe. It is, of course, a glorious testimony to his merit, and a certificate of his
patriotism, that ought to endear him to every honest Briton."[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. VII. p. 500. See, also, History of the British Provinces,
4to. p. 158.]

Reference is here made to the memorial of Don Thomas Geraldino, the Spanish ambassador at the
British Court, in which, among other demands, he insisted that no troops should be sent over
to Georgia, and particularly remonstrated against the return of Oglethorpe.

About the same time intelligence reached England that the Spaniards at St. Augustine had ordered
the English merchants to depart, and were setting up barracks for troops that were daily expected;
that an embarkation was preparing at Havana, in which two thousand five hundred soldiers were
to be shipped in three large men-of-war, and eight transports; and that great quantities of
provisions had been laid in for them. Upon this, and other hostile indications, of which the
Trustees were apprised, they petitioned his Majesty that a regiment might be raised for the
defence and protection of the Colony. This was granted. Oglethorpe was appointed General and
Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's forces in Carolina and Georgia; and commissioned to raise
a regiment for the service and defence of those two Colonies, to consist of six companies of
one hundred men each, exclusive of non-commissioned officers and drums; to which a company
of grenadiers was afterwards added. "This regiment he raised in a very short time, as he disdained
to make a market of the service of his country, by selling commissions, but got such officers
appointed as were gentlemen of family and character in their respective counties; and, as he
was sensible what an advantage it was to the troops of any nation to have in every company
a certain number of such soldiers as had been bred up in the character of gentlemen, he engaged
about twenty young gentlemen of no fortune, to serve as cadets in his regiment, all of whom
he afterwards advanced by degrees to be officers, as vacancies happened; and was so far from
taking any money for the favor, that to some of them, he gave, upon their advancement, what
was necessary to pay the fees of their commissions, and to provide themselves for appearing
as officers."[1]

[Footnote 1: London Magazine, for 1757, p. 546.]

"He carried with him, also," says a writer of that day, "forty supernumeraries, at his own
expense; a circumstance very extraordinary in our armies, especially in our plantations."

With a view to create in the troops a personal interest in the Colony which they had enlisted
to defend, and to induce them eventually to become actual settlers, every man was allowed to
take with him a wife; for the support of whom some additional pay and rations, were offered.[1]
In reference to this, Governor Belcher, of Massachusetts, in writing to Lord Egmont, respecting
the settlement of Georgia, has these remarks; "Plantations labor with great difficulties; and
must expect to creep before they can go. I see great numbers of people who would be welcome
in that settlement; and have, therefore, the honor to think, with Mr. Oglethorpe, that the
soldiers sent thither should all be married men[2]."

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. VIII. p. 164.]

[Footnote 2: Manuscript Letter Book of Governor Belcher, in the archives of the Massachusetts
Historical Society.]

Early in the spring of 1738, some part of the regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel
Cochran, embarked for Georgia, and arrived at Charlestown, South Carolina, on the 3d of May.
They immediately proceeded to their destined rendezvous by land; as the General had taken care,
on his former expedition, to have the rout surveyed, and a road laid out and made passable
from Port Royal to Darien, or rather Frederica itself; and there were a sufficient number of
boats provided for passing the rivers.

As soon as Oglethorpe obtained the proper stores of arms, ammunition, military equipments,
and provisions, he embarked for Georgia, the third time, with six hundred men, women, and children,
including the complement of the new raised regiment, on the 5th of July, in the Hector and
Blandford, men-of-war; accompanied by five transports. They arrived at St. Simons on the 9th
of September, where their landing at the soldier's fort, was announced by a discharge of artillery,
and cheered by the garrison. The General encamped near the fort, and staid till the 21st, to
forward the disembarkation, and give out necessary orders.[1]

[Footnote 1: Letter from Frederica, in Georgia, dated October 8th, 1738, in the Gentleman's
Magazine, for January, 1739, p. 22.]

He then went to Frederica, and was saluted by fifteen pieces of cannon at the fort. The magistrates
and townsmen waited on him in a body, to congratulate him on his return.

On the 25th the inhabitants of the town went out with the General, and cut a road through the
woods down to the soldiers-fort, in a strait line; so that there is an open communication between
them. This work was performed in three days, though it is a distance of three miles.

Several Indians came to greet the General. They hunted in the vicinity, and brought venison
every day to the camp. They reported that the chiefs from every town of the Upper and Lower
Creek nation would set out to visit him as soon as they received notice of his return.

The arrival of the regiment, so complete and in so good order, was a great relief to the people
of Frederica, as they had been often, during the summer, apprehensive of an attack by the Spaniards,
who had sent large reinforcements of troops to St. Augustine, and were understood to be providing
a formidable embarkation at the Havana, notwithstanding the treaty which had been so lately
concluded with Oglethorpe. Nay, the Floridians had actually attacked one of the Creek towns
that was next to them; but, though the assault was made by surprise, they were repulsed with
loss; and then they pretended that it was done by their Indians, without their orders.

Under circumstances of so much jeopardy, the people were so often diverted from their daily
labor, that their culture and husbandry had been greatly neglected; and there was the appearance
of such a scarcity, that many would be reduced to actual want before the next crop could be
got in. But, in consequence of the measures now taking for their security, and of some supplies
which were brought, in addition to the military stores, and of more that would be sent for,
the anxiety was removed, and they resumed their labors.

"The utmost care was taken by the General, that in all the frontier places the fortifications
should be put in the best state of defence; and he distributed the forces in the properest
manner for the protection and defence of the Colony; assigning different corps for different
services; some stationary at their respective forts; some on the alert, for ranging the woods;
others, light-armed, for sudden expeditions. He likewise provided vessels, and boats for scouring
the sea-coast, and for giving intelligence of the approach of any armed vessels. He went from
one military station to another, superintending and actually assisting every operation; and
endured hardness as a good soldier, by lying in tents, though all the officers and soldiers
had houses and huts where they could have fires when they desired; and indeed they often had
need, for the weather was severe. In all which services, it was declared that he gave at the
same time his orders and his example; there being nothing which he did not, that he directed
others to do; so that, if he was the first man in the Colony, his preeminence was founded upon
old Homer's maxims, 'He was the most fatigued, the first in danger, distinguished by his cares
and his labors, and not by any exterior marks of grandeur, more easily dispensed with, since
they were certainly useless.'"[1]

[Footnote 1: HARRIS'S Voyages, II. p. 332.]

But there was treachery lurking in the camp, which, though for some time suspected, had been
so vigilantly watched and guarded against, that the conspirators found no opportunity for carrying
into effect their insidious purpose.

It seems that among the troops lately sent over, there was one soldier who had been in the
Spanish service, and two others who were Roman Catholics and disclaimed allegiance to the British
Government, who had enlisted as spies, and been bribed to excite a mutiny in the corps, or
persuade those among whom they were stationed to desert the service.[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. IX. 739, p. 22.]

Their attempts, however, to gain over accomplices, were unavailing; for those with whom they
tampered had the fealty to reject their overtures, and the honesty to make a discovery of their
insidious machinations. Upon this the traitors were seized, convicted, and, on the beginning
of October, 1738, sentenced to be whipt and drummed out of the regiment.[1]

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. XX.]

Hardly had this secret plot been defeated, when an affray took place at Fort St. Andrews, in
which an attempt was made to assassinate the General, who was there on a visit.

Some of the soldiers who came from Gibraltar had been granted six months provisions from the
King's stores, in addition to their pay. When these rations were expended, about the middle
of November, one of the murmurers had the presumption to go up to the General, who was standing
at the door with Captain Mackay, and demanded of him a continuance of the supply. To this unceremonious
and disrespectful requisition the General replied, that the terms of their enlistment had been
complied with; that their pay was going on; that they had no special favor to expect, and certainly
were not in the way to obtain any by such a rude manner of application. As the fellow became
outrageously insolent, the Captain drew his sword, which the desperado snatched out of his
hand, broke in two pieces, threw the hilt at him, and made off for the barrack, where, taking
his gun, which was loaded, and crying out "One and all!" five others, with their guns, rushed
out, and, at the distance of about ten yards, the ringleader shot at the General. The ball
whizzed above his shoulder, and the powder burnt his face and scorched his clothes. Another
flashed his piece twice, but the gun did not go off. The General and Captain were immediately
surrounded by protectors; and the culprits were apprehended, tried at a Court-Martial, and,
on the first week in October, received sentence of death. The letter which gives a circumstantial
account of this affair, written from Frederica, and dated December 26th, adds, "Some of the
officers are not very easy, and perhaps will not be till the mutineers are punished, in terrorem;
which has been delayed by the General's forbearance[1]." I quote, with pleasure, this testimony
to his lenity, given by one who must have intimately known all the aggravating circumstances,
because some accounts state that he took summary vengeance.

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. IX. p. 215.]

By the defeat of insidious plottings to induce the desertion of the frontier garrison, and
the suppression of the insurgent mutiny, the spirit of insubordination was entirely quelled;
and the people of the Colony were relieved from their apprehensions of an attack from the Spaniards,
"as they had Oglethorpe among them, in whom they and the Indians had great confidence."

On the 8th of October, 1738, Oglethorpe set out from Frederica in an open boat, with two others
attending it; and, after rowing two days and two nights, arrived at Savannah. "He was received,
at the water-side, by the magistrates, and saluted by the cannon from the fort, and by the
militia under arms; and the people spent the night in rejoicing, making bonfires,"[1] &c. But,
notwithstanding this show of public joy, he had soon to learn particulars of the situation
of the inhabitants, that rendered his visit unpleasant to himself, and not very welcome to
some of those to whom it was made. Those who were duly sensible of his disinterested devotedness
to the advancement and welfare of the settlement, were actuated, on this occasion, by a principle
of real regard and gratitude; those who were apprehensive that their conduct in his absence
might be investigated and disapproved, joined in the acclaim, that they might conciliate his
favor; and those who had been discontented grumblers, did not care openly to exhibit indications
of dissatisfaction.

[Footnote 1: Letter, dated Savannah, in Georgia, October 22,1738; published in the Gentleman's
Magazine, for January, 1739, p. 22.]

On the day after his arrival he received information that the grand jury of Savannah had prepared
a representation, "stating their grievances, hardships, and necessities," and complaining of
the conduct of Mr. Thomas Causton, the first magistrate of the town, and keeper of the public
store[1]. They alleged that he had expended much larger sums than the Trustees authorized,
and thus brought the Colony in debt; that he had assumed powers not delegated to him, and had
been partial and arbitrary in many of the measures which he had pursued[2].

[Footnote 1: This is inserted in the Narrative of the Colony of Georgia, by P. Tailfer, M.D.,
Hugh Williamson, M.A., and D. Douglas. Charlestown, S.C. 1741. It was signed September 12th, 1737.]

[Footnote 2: Letter last quoted, and Stephens's Journal, Vol. I. p. 305.]

Upon an investigation of these allegations, Oglethorpe, as Governor-General of the Colony,
deemed it expedient to displace him; to issue an order that the books, papers, and accounts,
belonging to the stores, should be delivered to Thomas Jones, Esq., who had come over with
the transports with the appointment of Advocate of the Regiment; and that security should be
given by Causton, to answer the charges against him, by an assignment of his estate at Oakstead,
and his improvements elsewhere. The office thus rendered vacant was supplied by the appointment
of Colonel William Stephens, who had been sent over with the commission of Secretary for the
affairs of the Trustees in the Province.[1]

[Footnote 1: This worthy gentleman wrote a Journal, which commences on his arrival at Charlestown,
in the Mary-Ann, Captain Shubrick, October 20, 1737, and comes down to October 28,1741. It
gives a minute account of every thing which occurred; and bears throughout the marks of correctness,
of ingenuousness, and frankness in the narrative of transactions and events; and of integrity,
strict justice, and unflinching fidelity in the discharge of his very responsible office. As
exhibiting "the form and pressure of the times," it is of essential importance to the Historian
of Georgia; and, happily, it was printed, making three octavo volumes. But the work is exceedingly
rare, especially the third volume. A complete set is among the EBELING books in Harvard College
Library.

He had been at Savannah before, for in p. 46, is this remark; "All which was evident to myself,
as well from what I observed, when here formerly, as more especially now, since my arrival."
And again, p. 54, mentioning Mr. Fallowfield, "a constable, whose temper I was better acquainted
with, having lodged at his house during my former abode here."

After the departure of General Oglethorpe, he was President of the Council, and acting Governor
from July 11, 1743, to April 8, 1757, when he was succeeded by Henry Parker, Esq.]

The great mismanagement of the trust-funds which had been sent for the support of the Colony,
rendered it also necessary to retrench the ordinary issues, "that something might remain for
the necessary support of life among the industrious part of the community, who were not to
be blamed."

On the 11th, Tomo Chichi came to wait upon the General. He had been very ill; but the good
old man was so rejoiced at the return of his respected friend, that he said it made him moult
like the eagle.[1] He informed him that several Indian chiefs were at Yamacraw to pay their
respects to him, and to assure him of their fidelity.

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. XXI.]

This embassy consisted of the Micos or chiefs of the Ocmulgees, the Chehaws, the Ouchasees,
and the Parachacholas, with thirty of their warriors, and fifty-two attendants. As they walked
up the hill, they were saluted by a battery of cannon, and then conducted to the town-hall
by a corps of militia, where the General received them. They told him that the Spaniards had
decoyed them to St. Augustine, on pretence that he was there; but they found that they were
imposed upon, and therefore turned back with displeasure, though they were offered great presents
to induce them to fall out with the English. These single-hearted foresters had now come to
remove from the mind of their pledged friend all apprehension of their alienation, and to assure
him that their warriors shall attend his call. They closed their conference with a pressing
invitation to him to come up to their towns in the course of the summer; and, with his promise
to do so, they took a respectful leave.

On the 17th the General called the inhabitants to assemble at the town-hall, and "there made
a pathetic speech to them;"[1] which he began by thanking them for the measures which they
had pursued for mutual help and the common good. He apprized them of the great exertions made
by the Trustees to support, protect, and defend the Colony; but that their being obliged to
maintain the garrisons, and lay in various stores till the arrival of the troops, and the dear
price of provisions the last year, occasioned such an increased demand upon them, that they
would not be able to continue further allowance, nor assume further responsibilities, unless
a supply should be granted by parliament. This state of embarrassment he greatly regretted,
inasmuch as those whom he addressed were suffering by the failure of their crops. He told them
that, with surprise and great grief, he found that there was more due from the public store
than there were goods and articles in it to pay; but that he had given orders that all persons
should be paid as far as these effects would go. He said that he was fully aware of the privations
already felt, and of the greater to which they were exposed; and, therefore, informed those
who, on this account, or for any reason, supposed that they could better their condition by
going out of the Province, that they had his full consent to do so. At the same time he requested
such to come to his quarters, and acquaint him with their grievances, their wishes, and their
purposes, and he would give them his best advice, and all the aid in his power. How many, or
how far any, availed themselves of this overture, is not known; but the writer who has given
an account of this address, adds, "It is remarkable that not one man chose to leave the Province,
though they very well knew that they must endure great hardships before the next crop should
come in, for there was very little money stirring, and very few had provisions sufficient to
keep them till next year. However, they all seemed resolved rather to stay, than to leave the
country now in its distress[2]."

[Footnote 1: STEPHENS'S Journal, I. p. 305.]

[Footnote 2: Letter from Savannah, October 22, 1738.]

To lessen the demands upon the Trustees, Oglethorpe made retrenchments in the public expenditures.
He disbanded the troop of Rangers, who guarded the country on the land side, though they offered
to serve without pay; but he deemed it improper that they should be on service without remuneration.
The garrisons were relieved by the regiments; so that that expense ceased. He aimed to reconcile
the disaffected, by his good offices; and to gain their affections by unexpected and unmerited
liberalities. With very timely largesses he assisted the orphans, the widows, and the sick;
and contributed towards the relief of the most destitute; but, adds the writer of the letter
above quoted, "we are apprehensive such contributions cannot last long, unless assisted from
England, for the expenses are too great for any single man to bear."

The General pursued, with anxious scrutiny, his investigation into the management of business,
and found the charges and accounts to be very perplexed, and the result evincing mismanagement
and unfaithfulness. "He settled the officers, civil and military, among whom changes had taken
place; filled vacancies; and took the most judicious measures that the whole municipal establishment
should be properly organized. Then, calling them all to his lodgings, he gave it in charge
that they should do their duties with care and vigilance. He exhorted them to use their best
endeavors to preserve peace; especially at this time, when ill-disposed persons, taking advantage
of people's uneasiness at those inevitable pressures under which they labored, and must necessarily
for some time be subjected to, might craftily incite them to insurrection. Withal, he recommended
earnestly to them to preserve unanimity among themselves, which would strengthen and support
a due authority, and restrain the licentious into due obedience."[1]

[Footnote 1: STEPHENS'S Journal, I. 309.]

On Wednesday morning, October 25th, Oglethorpe set out for the south, leaving, as Col. Stephens
remarks, "a gloomy prospect of what might ensue; and many sorrowful countenances were visible
under the apprehensions of future want; which deplorable state the Colony has fallen into,
through such means as few or none of the settlers had any imagination of, till the Trustees,
in their late letters, awakened them out of their dream; and the General, when he came, laid
the whole open, and apprized them that they were but little removed from a downright bankruptcy.
Now was a time when it would be fully apparent, who were the most valuable among them, by showing
a hearty endeavor to contribute, what in them lay, to appease the rising discontents, and wait
with patience to see better things, which were not yet to be despaired of."[1]

[Footnote 1: STEPHENS'S Journal, I. 312.]

It appears that Mr. Causton discovered not only reluctance and perversity in explaining and
authenticating his accounts; but, by disingenuous insinuations reflected on the conduct of
Oglethorpe, "as if he very well knew that extraordinary occasions had created these great exceedings,
which the Trustees approving of, he [Causton] was given up to be driven to utter ruin."[1]
Mr. Jones deemed it necessary to write to the General to inform him of the reflections which
had thus been cast upon his honor, and of the impediments which he himself met in the business
assigned to him. Upon the receipt of this letter, Oglethorpe set out on a return to Savannah,
where he arrived early in the morning of Saturday, November 11th, and, as the bell was ringing
for attendance on prayers, he went and joined the orisons of the congregation. This was more
grateful to his feelings than the military salute and parade of the preceding visit; and the
devotional exercises in which he engaged soothed his vexed spirit, and the petition for pardon
of offences against God produced a livelier disposition in his heart of lenity and forgiveness
towards those who had offended against him. In the course of the day, he looked again into
the concerns of the store, and despatched some other affairs of consequence. In the evening
he sent for Mr. Causton, when, "in a very mild manner, and gentler terms than could be expected,
upon such a provocation, he reprehended him for the freedom he had taken with his name, and
advised him to use no delays or shifts in making up his accounts."

[Footnote 1: Ibid. p. 325.]

On Sunday he attended public worship; and after that took boat, and went back to the south.

In both these visits to Savannah, Oglethorpe discovered among the inhabitants indications of
the prevalence of not only a dissatisfied, but of a factious spirit; more to be lamented than
a failing harvest, or a stinted market.

It was extremely mortifying to him to perceive that his greatest exertions and most assiduous
services were underrated; his devotedness to their welfare unacknowledged; and his sacrifices
and exposures that he might establish them in security and peace, were not merely depreciated,
but miscalled and dishonored. While he was zealously engaged in strengthening the Colony, by
locating large accessions of brave and industrious settlers on the frontiers, and erecting
forts, and supplying them with troops and ammunition, the people who were "sitting under their
own vines and fig-trees, with none to molest or make them afraid," and who had been best and
longest provided for, were insensible to the hardships and dangers to which others were exposed;
and, cavilling at the circumstances in which they were placed, complained as if he must be
personally accountable for certain restrictions in the plan of settlement, and subsequent financial
and commercial affairs, to which the Trustees had deemed it proper to subject them; restrictions
which might have been submitted to by them with as good a grace as they were by the Saltzburgers
at Ebenezer and the Scots at Darien, "who murmured not, neither were unthankful." In fact,
it was very apparent, that by their indolence and improvidence these dissatisfied ones had
brought upon themselves the chief of the evils which they suffered. Their allegations, therefore,
were unreasonable, and the disposition which dictated them criminally ungrateful. But Oglethorpe,
instead of reproaching the discontented for their ingratitude, and the murmurers for their
unkind imputations, stifled his own justifiable feelings of displeasure, in the hope that such
forbearance would refute the injustice of theirs. Well might the poet exclaim:

  "What magnanimity!--May ne'er again
     Unkind returns thy generous ardor chill,
   Nor causeless censure give thy bosom pain,
     Nor thankless hearts reward thy good with ill!

   "But honoring gratitude its column raise,
     To bear inscriptions of deserved praise;
   And when through age the record is obscure,
    A nobler let posterity procure."

As Oglethorpe was appointed General and Commander in Chief of the military forces in South
Carolina, as well as Georgia, he deemed it proper to pay a visit to Charlestown, in order to
have this assigned rank duly notified to the Governor and people of the Province. He, therefore,
set out for that metropolis on the 10th of March, 1739; arrived on the 15th, and, on the 3d
of April, had his commission opened and read in the Assembly. In reference to the exercise
of the authority which it conferred, some regulations in the military establishment were adopted.
On the 11th he returned to Savannah. To encourage the industry of the planters, he proposed
to those who would persevere in doing what they could in the culture of their lands, "a bounty
of two shillings per bushel for all Indian corn, and one shilling per bushel for all potatoes,
which they should raise over and above what the produce could be sold for after the next harvest[1]."

[Footnote 1: STEPHENS, I. 460.]

On the 18th he went to Frederica; but was obliged, in the summer, to renew his visit to Savannah;
and, on the evening of the 10th of July, was received, under a discharge of cannon, by about
forty of the freeholders under arms, which, he was pleased to say, was more than he expected.
"His stay, being very likely to be short, many successively sought audience of him, whose affairs
he despatched with his usual promptness."

"On the 17th he set off on his Indian expedition to Coweta: he proceeded up the river, in his
cutter, with Lieutenant Dunbar, Ensign Leman, and Mr. Eyre, a cadet, besides attendants and
servants. At the Uchee town, twenty-five miles above Ebenezer, he quitted water-conveyance,
having appointed several of the Indian traders to wait his coming there, with a number of horses,
as well for sumpter as riding, and also some rangers to assist."

On this journey, computed to be over three hundred miles, both he and his attendants met with
many and great hardships and fatigue. They were obliged to traverse a continuous wilderness,
where there was no road, and seldom any visible track; and their Indian guides led them often,
unavoidably, through tangled thickets, and deep and broken ravines, and across swamps, or bogs,
where the horses mired and plunged to the great danger of the riders. They had to pass large
rivers on rafts, and cause the horses to wade and swim; and to ford others. During most of
the way their resolute leader was under the necessity of sleeping in the open air, wrapped
in his cloak or a blanket, and with his portmanteau for a pillow; or, if the night-weather
was uncomfortable, or rainy, a covert was constructed of cypress boughs, spread over poles.
For two hundred miles there was not a hut to be met with; nor a human face to be seen, unless
by accident that of some Indian hunter traversing the woods. At length they arrived at Coweta,
one of the principal towns of the Muscoghe, or Creek Indians, where the Chiefs of all the tribes
were assembled, on the 11th of August. "Thus did this worthy man, to protect the settlement,
which with so much pecuniary expense and devotedness of time, he had planted, now expose himself
to the hazards and toils of a comfortless expedition, that would have proved unsurmountable
to one of a less enterprising spirit and steady resolutions." Oglethorpe, and his suite, were
received with great cordiality; and, after the necessary introduction to individuals, and a
little refreshment and rest, a grand convention was formed. The assembly was arranged in due
order, with the solemn introductory ceremonies prescribed for such occasions. A libation of
the foskey,[1] or black-drink, followed; of which Oglethorpe was invited to partake with "the
beloved men," and of which the chiefs and warriors quaffed more copious draughts. Speeches
and discussions followed; terms of intercourse and stipulations of trade were agreed upon;
and, after smoking the calumet, they unitedly declared that they remained firm in their pledged
fealty to the King of Great Britain, and would adhere to all the engagements of amity and commerce
heretofore entered into with Oglethorpe as the representative of the Trustees. They then renewed
the former grants, in terms more explicit and full, confirming the session of territory on
the sea-coast, with the islands, and now extending the southern boundary to the river Matteo,
or St. John's. And Oglethorpe, on his part, covenanted that the English should not encroach
upon, nor take up, other lands, nor intrude upon any reserved privileges of the Creeks; but
would cause their rights to be respected, and the trade with them to be conducted upon fair
and honorable principles. This important treaty was concluded on the 21st of August, 1739.

[Footnote 1: This is a decoction of the leaves of the YAUPON, prinus glaber, and is of an exciting,

as a sacred beverage, used only by the Chiefs, the War Captains, and Priests ("beloved men")
on special occasions, particularly on going to war and making treaties. For an account of its
preparation and use, see LAWSON'S Carolina, p. 90; BERNARD ROMAN'S Natural History of Florida,
p. 94; ADAIR'S History of the American Indians, p. 108; CATESBY'S Natural History of Carolina,
II. 57; and BARTON'S Elements of Botany, part II. p. 16.]

Oglethorpe ingratiated himself highly with the Creeks on this occasion, by his having undertaken
so long and difficult a journey to become acquainted with them, and secure their favor; trusting
himself with so few attendants in a fearless reliance on their good faith; by the readiness
with which he accommodated himself to their mode of living; and the magnanimity of his deportment
while among them.

The chief business being finished to mutual satisfaction, the General, with his attendants,
set out on their return; and, after enduring the like hardships, exposures, and fatigue, arrived,
on the 5th of September, at Fort Augusta, an outpost on the Savannah, where he had placed a
garrison on his first expedition to Georgia; and under the protection of which, a little settlement
was now formed, inhabited mostly by Indian traders. There he was waited on by the chiefs of
the Chickasaws, and the chiefs of the Cherokees;[1] the last of whom came with a heavy complaint
that his people had been poisoned by the rum which had been brought to them by the traders.
At this they expressed high resentment, and even threatened revenge. As this was an affair
of quite an alarming nature, the General made strict inquiry into it; and ascertained that
some unlicensed traders had, the preceding summer, carried up the small pox, which is fatal
to the Indians; and that several of their warriors, as well as others, had fallen victims to
the distemper. It was with some difficulty that he convinced the Indians that this was the
real cause of the calamity. At the same time he assured them that such were the precautions
and strict examination used, before any applicant for leave to trade could obtain it, that
they need not apprehend any danger from such as came to them with a license. With this explanation
and assurance they went away satisfied.

[Footnote 1: By some early writers of Carolina these chiefs are called "Caciques." Whether
this be the same as Mico, I know not; but the title, though often used so, does not seem to
be appropriate. Where justly applied, it is the title of the legislative chief, in distinction
from the war chief.]

On the 13th of September, while yet at this place, an express arrived from Savannah to acquaint
him that a sloop from Rhode Island had brought the intelligence, that the Governor of that
Colony had, by orders from Great Britain, issued commissions for fitting out privateers against
the Spaniards. This was not a little surprising to him. He could not conceive how a distant
Colony should have any such orders, before they were sent to him who was most in danger of
being attacked, in case of any rupture with Spain. However, he deemed it expedient to hasten
his return, in order to obtain more direct information. On the 22d he reached Savannah, where
he received and published his Majesty's orders for reprisals. In consequence of these, a stout
privateer of fourteen guns, was immediately fitted out by Captain Davies, who had suffered
by having had a ship and cargo, to the value of forty thousand pieces of eight, captured and
most unjustly condemned by the Spaniards; and, therefore, felt that he had a right to avail
himself of the present opportunity for obtaining redress.[1]

[Footnote 1: London Magazine, for 1757, page 592.]

For several years, the British trade to America, particularly that to the West Indies, had
suffered great interruption and annoyance from the Spanish guarda-costas, which, under various
pretences, seized the merchant ships, and carried them into their ports, where they were confiscated.
This piratical practice had increased to such a degree that scarcely any vessels were safe
in those seas; for the Spaniards pretended that wherever they found logwood, cocoa, or pieces
of eight on board, the capture was legal. Now, the first two of those commodities were the
growth and produce of the English islands, and the last was the current specie of all that
part of the world; so that there was hardly a ship homeward bound but had one or other of these
on hoard.

These depredations were also aggravated by circumstances of great inhumanity and cruelty; the
sailors being confined in loathsome prisons, at the Havana, and at Cadiz; or forced to work
with irons on their legs; with no sustenance but salt fish, almost putrid, and beds full of
vermin, so that many died of their hard captivity[1].

[Footnote 1: History of the Colonies planted by the English on the Continent of North America,
by JOHN MARSHALL. 8vo. Philadelphia, 1824. Chap. X.]

The increasing complaints of the merchants, and the loud clamors of the nation, at length forced
the British minister to abandon his pacific system; and war was declared against Spain on the
23d of October, 1739. 8vo.. Dublin, 1748. Vol. I. p. 27.]

It now became necessary for Oglethorpe to take the most prompt and effective measures for the
protection of the Colony; and, as his settlement had, from the beginning, been opposed by the
Spaniards at St. Augustine, and would now have to encounter their resentful assaults, he must
put into requisition all his military force, and see to their adequate equipment. He immediately
took measures for raising a troop of thirty rangers, to prevent the Spanish horse and Indians
at St. Augustine from making incursions into the Province; and likewise to intercept the runaway
negroes of Carolina, on their way through the country to join the Spaniards. At the same time
he summoned four hundred Creeks, and six hundred Cherokee Indians to march down to the southern
borders. He then viewed the arms of the militia, to ascertain that they were all in good order,
and gave directions that powder, balls, and flints, should be issued out of the magazine, for
supplying each member with a proper quantity. But aware that all this would be too inconsiderable
for effectual resistance, he perceived it to be expedient to seek the protection of the West
India fleet, and to apply to the Assembly of South Carolina for coöperation in a cause, in
the event of which their own safety was involved. Accordingly he immediately sent up to Charlestown
to desire assistance, and to consult measures with the commanders of the men of war then on
the station, in order immediately to block up St. Augustine before the Spaniards could receive
supplies and reinforcements from Cuba; which, if properly executed, the place would, in all
probability, be soon reduced.[1] This application was laid before the General Assembly, and,
on the 8th of November, a Committee was appointed to take the same into consideration. Their
Report was discussed in both Houses of Assembly; but no decision was obtained.

[Footnote 1: See his letter in the History of the Rise and Progress of Georgia, HARRIS'S Voyages,
II. p. 338, dated 21st of September, 1739.]

Having taken these preparatory measures, he returned to Frederica to make all the arrangements
which the exigences of the case required, in the equipment of his own forces, and by calling
upon his Indian allies; waiting, with impatience, however, the result of his application to
the sister Colony.

Towards the middle of November a party of Spaniards landed in the night time upon Amelia island,
and skulked in the thicket till morning, when two Highlanders, unarmed, went into the woods
for fuel; upon whom the Spaniards fired, first five and then ten shot; which was heard by Francis
Brooks, who commanded the scout-boat upon the coast. He immediately made a signal to the Fort,
which was then garrisoned by a detachment of General Oglethorpe's regiment. Upon this a party
instantly went out, but they arrived too late, for they found their comrades dead, and that
the assassins had taken to their boat, and put out to sea. The bodies of the soldiers were
not only rent with shot, but most barbarously mangled and hacked. The periodical publication
from which this account is taken, has the following remarks:[1] "Whence it was apparent that
the Spaniards had first, out of cowardice, shot them, and then, out of cruelty, cut and slashed
them with their swords. If they had not been most scandalous poltroons, they would have taken
the two unarmed men prisoners, without making any noise; and then they might have lurked in
the wood till they had found an opportunity of getting a better booty, or at least of making
more prisoners. And, if they had not been most barbarously cruel, they would have been satisfied
with simply killing these unresisting men, (which might have been without such a volley of
shot,) and not have so mangled their bodies after they were slain. From such cowardly and cruel
foes no mercy can be expected; and every one sent against them must despair if he finds himself
in danger of being overpowered, and wrought up to desperation and revenge when he finds himself
any thing near upon an equal footing."

[Footnote 1: Annals of Europe, for 1739, p. 410.]

Upon being informed of this outrage, Oglethorpe fitted out and manned a gun boat, and pursued
them by water and land, above a hundred miles; but they escaped. By way of reprisal, however,
he passed the St. John's into Florida; drove in the guards of Spanish horse that were posted
on that river; and advanced as far as a place called the Canallas; at the same time sending
Captain Dunbar with a party to find out the situation and force of the fort at Picolata, near
the river, upon what were then called "the lakes of Florida," eighty miles from the mouth of
the river. They attacked the garrison, but were repulsed, having no artillery. They accomplished,
however, the intentions of Oglethorpe, as they reconnoitred both that place and another fort
called St. Francis.

In January he returned to Frederica, where he met with Captain Warren,[1] who had lately arrived
with the Squirrel man of war. When their consultation was concluded, Captain Warren went and
cruised off the Bay of St. Augustine, while Oglethorpe, with a detachment of troops on board
of the boats, and some artillery, went up the Lakes of Florida, rowing by day, and sailing
by night, so that he attacked the two forts Picolata and St. Francis, took both the same day,
and made the soldiers in the garrisons prisoners of war.

[Footnote 1: Afterwards Sir PETER WARREN, an excellent naval officer.]

Captain Hugh Mackay, in a letter to Colonel Cecil, dated Frederica, 24th of January, 1740,
says, "The General escaped very narrowly being killed by a cannon ball at Fort St. Francis,
or, as the Spaniards called it, 'San Francisco de Papa.'"

By the information which Oglethorpe was able to obtain from the prisoners, which confirmed
the accounts received from other sources, he learned that the garrison at St. Augustine was
in want of provisions; and that, the half-galleys having been sent to the Havana for troops
and supplies, the river and sea-board were destitute of defence. Such being the case, he conceived
that a fitting opportunity now offered for the reduction of the place, taking the enemy by
surprise, before the reinforcements arrived; and thereby dispossessing the Spaniards of Florida.
He, therefore, sent an express to Lieutenant-Governor Bull, urging an immediate compliance
with his application for assistance. The consideration was accordingly renewed in the Assembly
on the 4th of February. At length Oglethorpe, impatient of delays occasioned by their continued
demurring about the feasibility of the project, presented himself before them, that they might
be made acquainted more fully with his intentions, and with every thing relative to their being
carried into execution. After many conferences, a scheme of action was agreed upon, and an
Act of Assembly passed, April 5th, 1740, for the raising of a regiment of four hundred men,
to be commanded by Colonel Vanderdussen; a troop of rangers;[1] presents for the Indians; and
supply of provisions for three months.[2] They also furnished a large schooner, with ten carriage
and sixteen swivel guns, in which they put fifty men under the command of Captain Tyrrell.

[Footnote 1: As the Rangers could not be procured, the Assembly afterwards voted an addition
of two hundred men.]

[Footnote 2: The term of service, and, of course, the amount of supply, were afterwards extended
to four months.]

With this encouragement, and the promise of coöperation by Commodore Vincent Price, who commanded
the small fleet on that station, the place of rendezvous was appointed at the mouth of St.
John's river. The General then published his manifesto,[1] and immediately hastened back to
Georgia to prepare his forces for the Expedition.

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. XXII.]

On the beginning of April he went to the Uchee town to engage runners to his Indian allies
to inform them of his intended assault of St. Augustine; to bespeak their assistance, and request
their chiefs and warriors to join his forces at Frederica, whither he immediately repaired.
There he completed the equipment of his forces; selected the field-pieces and their carriages,
balls and powder; and attended to the military accoutrements, stores and provisions.

On the 9th of May he passed over to Florida with four hundred selected men of his regiment,
and a considerable party of Indians, headed by Molochi, son of Prim the late chief of the Creeks;
Raven, war-chief of the Cherokees; and Toonahowi, nephew of Tomo Chichi. On the evening of
the 10th, part of the Carolina forces arrived.

As the first thing to be done was to take the forts that kept open the communication of the
Spaniards with the country, and thus cut off their supplies, the General, impatient of losing
time, invested the small fort called Francis de Pupa, seventeen miles north of St. Augustine,
commanded by a sergeant and twelve men, who surrendered without a contest. Thence he proceeded
to Fort Diego, situated on the plains, twenty-five miles from St. Augustine, defended by eleven
guns, and fifty regulars, besides Indians and negroes. In his sortie upon this, he made use
of a little stratagem, as well as force; which was by appointing three or four drums to beat,
at the same time, in different places in the woods, and a few men now and then to appear suddenly,
and withdraw out of sight again. At this, the enemy in the fort were so confounded, with the
apprehension that they were surrounded by a great number of troops, that they made only a feint
of opposition; and, being summoned to surrender, did so, on condition of being treated as prisoners
of war, and, (what they principally insisted on) not to be delivered into the hands of the
Indians, from whom they were conscious that they had incurred the most condign reprisals for
former aggressions.[1] The other articles were that they should deliver up the guns and stores,
which consisted of nine swivel and two carriage guns, with the powder and shot, &c.; that they
should have liberty to keep their baggage; that Seignior Diego Spinosa, to whom the fort belonged,
it having been built at his expense, and on his land, should hold his plantation and slaves,
and such other effects as were not already plundered in the field; and, finally, that no deserters
or runaways from Charlestown should have the benefit of this capitulation. Here he left a garrison
of sixty men, under the command of Lieutenant Dunbar, to secure the retreat of the army, in
case of accidents, and to preserve a safe communication with the settlements in Georgia. He
then returned to the place of rendezvous, where he was joined on the 19th of May by Captain
M'Intosh, with a company of Highlanders, and Colonel Vanderdussen, with the rest of the Carolina
troops, but without any horse, pioneers, or negroes.

[Footnote 1: Stephens, II. 389.]

By this time six Spanish half-galleys, with a number of long brass nine pounders, manned with
two hundred regulars, and attended by two sloops loaded with ammunition and provisions, had
entered the harbor of St. Augustine, so that the forces in the town and castle were very nearly
equal in numbers to the land forces brought against them, and their artillery much superior.

Notwithstanding all the reinforcement which Oglethorpe had received, it was judged impracticable
to take the place by assault from the land side, unless an attack could be made at the same
time by the boats of the men of war, and other small craft, on the sea side, on which the town
had no intrenchments; and to begin a regular siege on the land side was impossible, as he had
neither force enough for investing the place, nor any pioneers for breaking the ground, and
carrying on the approaches. For this reason it was concerted between him and the sea commanders,
that as soon as they arrived off the bar of the north channel, he should march up with his
whole force, consisting of about two thousand men, to St. Augustine, and give notice by a signal
agreed on, that he was ready to begin the attack by land; which should be answered by a counter
signal from the fleet of their readiness to attack it by sea. Accordingly the General marched,
and arrived near the intrenchments of St. Augustine, June 4th, at night, having in his way
taken Fort Moosa, about three miles from St. Augustine, which the garrison had abandoned upon
his approach. He ordered the gates of the fort to be burnt, and three breaches to be made in
the walls.

As soon as it was proper to begin the attack, he made the signal agreed on, but had no countersign
from the men of war. This was to his utter surprise and disappointment. The reason which was
afterwards assigned, was, that the fleet had ascertained that their promised cooperation had
been rendered impracticable; as the galleys had been drawn up abreast in the channel between
the castle and the island, so that any boats which they should send in must have been exposed
to the cannon and musketry of the galleys, as well as the batteries of the castle; and, as
no ships of force could get in to protect them, they must have been defeated, if not wholly
destroyed; and that it was impossible to make an attack by sea, while the galleys were in that
position. It being presumptuous to make an attack without the aid of the fleet, the General
was under the necessity of marching back to Fort Diego, where he had left all his provisions,
camp furniture, and tools; because he had neither horses nor carriages for taking them along
with him by land, nor had then any place for landing them near St. Augustine, had he sent them
by water.[1]

[Footnote 1: London Magazine, Vol. He also charged him, if he should perceive any superior
party sallying forth from St. Augustine, to make a quick retreat towards Fort Diego, where
it was certain the enemy would not follow him, for fear of having their retreat cut off by
a detachment from the army. He sent Colonel Vanderdussen, with his regiment, to take possession
of Point Quartell, at a creek which makes the mouth of the harbor opposite Anastasia; and this
he did "because they would be safe there, being divided from St. Augustine, and covered from
any sally that would be made by the garrison."[1]

[Footnote 1: History of the British Settlements in North America. Lond. 1773, 4to, page 163.]

As there was a battery on Anastasia, which defended the entry to St. Augustine, the Commodore
suggested that, if a body of troops should be sent to land upon that island, under favor of
the men of war, and dispossess it, he would then send the small vessels into the harbor, which
was too shallow to admit the ships. Upon this, the General marched to the coast, and embarked
in the boats of the men of war, with a party of two hundred men, and most of the Indians. Captain
Warren, with two hundred seamen, attached themselves to this expedition.

Perceiving that the Spaniards were advantageously posted behind the sand-hills, covered by
the battery upon the island, and the fire from the half-galleys which lay in shoal water where
the men of war could not come, he ordered the heavy boats to remain and seem as though they
intended to land near them, while he, with Captain Warren and the pinnaces, rowed, with all
the speed they could, to the southward about two miles. The Spaniards behind the sand-hills
strove to prevent their landing, but before they could come up in any order, the boats had
got so near to the shore that the General and Captain Warren, with the seamen and Indians,
leaped into the water breast high, landed, and took possession of the sand-hills. The Spaniards
retreated in the utmost confusion to the battery; but were pursued so vigorously, that they
were driven into the water, and took shelter in the half-galleys.[1]

[Footnote 1: London Magazine, Vol. XXVII. p. 22.]

All hands were now set to work to erect the batteries, whence a cannonade was made upon the
town. This, however, was to little effect; partly from the distance, and partly from the condition
of some of the field pieces which were employed. The enemy returned a brisk fire from the castle
and from the half-galleys in the harbor. The latter, chiefly annoying the camp, it was agreed
to attack them; but though Commodore Price had proposed that measure to Colonel Vanderdussen
first, he altered his opinion and would not consent to it.

"Thirty-six pieces of cannon, together with planks for batteries, and all other necessaries,
with four hundred pioneers were to have come from Carolina; but only twelve pieces of cannon
arrived. Of this disastrous event, the particulars are given by one who could say,--"Quos ego
miserrimus vidi, et quorum pars magna fui." [Which I had the misfortune to see, and greatly
to share.] I refer to a letter from Ensign Hugh Mackay to his brother in Scotland, dated at
Fort St. Andrews, on Cumberland Island, August 10th, 1740.

After some introductory remarks, he gives the following account of the action:

"On the 9th of June the General sent out a flying party of militia, Indians, and thirteen soldiers,
in all making one hundred and thirty-seven men, under the command of Colonel Palmer, a Carolina
gentleman, an old Indian warrior, of great personal resolution, but little conduct. Under him
I commanded the party, and had orders to march from St. Diego, the head-quarters, to Moosa,
three miles from St. Augustine, a small fort which the Spaniards had held, but was demolished
a few days before; there to show ourselves to the Spaniards, and thereafter to keep moving
from one place to another to divert their attention, while the General took another route,
and intended to come to Moosa in five days. The orders were just, and might with safety be
executed, had a regular officer commanded; but poor Colonel Palmer, whose misfortune it was
to have a very mean opinion of his enemies, would by no means be prevailed upon to leave the
old fort, but staid there, thinking the Spaniards durst not attack him. He was mistaken, as
will appear presently.

"Upon the 15th day of June, about four in the morning, we were attacked by a detachment of
five hundred, from the garrison of St. Augustine, composed of Spaniards, negroes, and Indians,
besides a party of horse to line the paths, that none of us might escape. Apprehending that
this would happen, I obtained leave of Colonel Palmer, and therefore ordered our drum to beat
to arms at three o'clock every morning, and to have our men in readiness till it was clear
day. Thus it was upon the fatal 15th of June, as I have said, when the Spaniards attacked us
with a very smart fire from their small arms; in which Colonel Palmer fell the first. We returned
the fire with the greatest briskness that can be imagined; and so the firing continued for
some time; but, unluckily, we were penned up in a demolished fort; there was no room to extend.
The Spaniards endeavored to get in at the ruinous gate; and our party defended the same with
the utmost bravery. Here was a terrible slaughter on both sides; but the Spaniards, who were
five times our number, got at last, by dint of strength, the better; which, when I saw, that
some prisoners were made, I ordered as many of my party then as were alive to draw off. We
had great difficulty to get clear, for the Spaniards surrounded the fort on all sides. However,
by the assistance of God, we got our way made good; drew up in sight of the enemy, and retired,
without being pursued, till we were in safety. I had no more than twenty-five men, and some
of them very ill wounded, of which number I was, for I received three wounds at the fort gate,
but they were slight ones. Several of the poor Highlanders, who were in the engagement, and
fought like lions, lost their lives,--some of them your acquaintance.

"I commanded, next Colonel Palmer, as captain of the horse, on the militia establishment. My
lieutenant was killed. My cornet and quartermaster were made prisoners of war, with four more
of the Highlanders. Charles Mackay, nephew to Captain Hugh Mackay, who was ensign of militia,
received five wounds in the action, and lost one of his fingers; and, thereafter, rather than
fall into the hands of the Spaniards, ventured to swim an inlet of the sea, about a mile broad,
and had the good fortune to get to the side he intended, and so to the General's camp.

"As the Indians fled several different ways, no more account is yet heard of them, only that
some of them were killed in the action, and others wounded and taken prisoners. I believe there
were sixty killed, and twenty taken prisoners of our whole party. To some of our Creek Indians
who were taken by the enemy, leave was given (to curry favor with their nation) to return home.
They told me that we killed a great number of the Spaniards at Moosa, and that they were dying
by fives and sixes a day after getting into the town; so miserably were they cut by our broad
swords; yet by their great numbers they got the day; but were sadly mauled, otherwise they
would have pursued me."

The fate of Colonel Palmer was the more affecting, from the consideration that he had raised
one hundred and fifty good men, who had come with him as volunteers; that he was in a fort
in which a breach had been made, and of course was no adequate protection; and that he was
beyond the reach of any assistance. It has, indeed, been said that he was not enough mindful
of the directions that had been given him, and presumptuously exposed himself to danger.[1]

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. XXIII.]

Mr. Stephens remarks that "the most bloody part of all fell to the unhappy share of our good
people of Darien, who, almost to a man engaged, under the command of their leader, John Moore
McIntosh; a worthy man, careful director among his people at home, and who now showed himself
as valiant in the field of battle; where, calling on his countrymen and soldiers to follow
his example, they made such havoc with their broadswords, as the Spaniards cannot easily forget."[1]
This brave champion was taken prisoner, and suffered severe and cruel treatment.[2]

[Footnote 1: Journal, II. 436.]

[Footnote 2: He was sent to Old Spain, where he remained a prisoner, at Madrid, for several
months; and was finally exchanged, and returned home to Darien.]

The principal commander of the Spaniards fell at the first onset.

The Spanish took several prisoners; basely insulted the bodies of the dead; and would have
inflicted vengeful cruelties on their captives, one of whom was an Indian named Nicholausa,
whom they delivered over to the Yamasees to burn, but General Oglethorpe sent a drum with a
message to the Governor from the Indian chief of the Cherokees, acquainting him that if he
permitted Nicholausa to be burnt, a Spanish horseman who had been taken prisoner should suffer
the same fate. He also mentioned that, as the Governor was a gentleman and a man of honor,
he was persuaded that he would put an end to the barbarous usage of that country; and expected
from the humanity of a Spanish cavalier that he would prohibit insults to the bodies of the
dead, and indignities to the prisoners; and he rather wished it, as he should be forced, against
his inclination, to resort to retaliation, which his Excellency must know that he was very
able to make, since his prisoners greatly exceeded those made by the Spaniards. Upon this the
Governor submitted to the rescue of Nicholausa from the fate to which he had been destined.
It was, also, agreed that the Indians, on both sides, should be treated as prisoners of war;
so that an end was put to their barbarous custom of burning the unhappy wretches who fell into
their hands.

Oglethorpe continued bombarding the castle and town until the regular troops came over from
the land side, and the Carolina militia were removed from Point Quartel to Anastasia. He then
summoned the Governor to surrender, but received an indignant refusal.

Soon after some sloops, with a reinforcement of men, and a further supply of military stores
and provisions from Havana, found means to enter the harbor through the narrow channel of the
Matanzas.

Upon this, all prospect of starving the enemy Was lost; and there remained only the chance
of a forcible assault and battery.

As the dernier resort, it was agreed, on the 23d of June, that Captain Warren, with the boats
from the men of war, the two sloops hired by General Oglethorpe, and the Carolina vessels,
with their militia, should attack the half-galleys; and, at a given signal, the General should
attack the trenches.

This was a desperate measure; for the whole of the troops belonging to the besiegers, including
even the seamen, were much inferior in number to the garrison. The town was also covered on
one side by a castle, with four bastions, and fifty pieces of cannon; from whence was run an
intrenchment, flanked with several salient angles to Fort Coovo, on the river Sebastian. This
intrenchment consisted of the neck of land from the river Anastasia to that of St. Sebastian,
and entirely covered the town from the island.

Upon this the General drew in all the strength that he possibly could, and sent for the garrison
that he had left at Diego. Being joined by them and by the Creek Indians, and having made a
sufficient number of fascines and short ladders, provided all other necessaries for attacking
the intrenchments, and brought up thirty-six cohorns, he received notice that the Commodore
had resolved to forego the attack; declaring, that, as the season of hurricanes was approaching,
he judged it imprudent to hazard his Majesty's ships any longer on the coast.[1]

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. XXIV.]

On the departure of the fleet, the place was no longer blockaded on the sea side; of course
the army began to despair of forcing the place to surrender. The provincials, under Colonel
Vanderdussen, enfeebled by the heat of the climate, dispirited by fruitless efforts, and visited
by sickness, marched away in large bodies.[1] The General himself, laboring under a fever,
and finding his men as well as himself worn out by fatigue, and rendered unfit for action,
reluctantly abandoned the enterprise. On the fourth of July everything which he had on the
island was reëmbarked, the troops transported to the continent, and the whole army began their
march for Georgia; the Carolina regiment first, and the General with his troops in the rear.
On this occasion a very notable answer of the Indian Chief is reported; for, being asked by
some of the garrison to march off with them, "No!" said he, "I will not stir a foot till I
see every man belonging to me marched off before me; for I have always been the first in advancing
towards an enemy, and the last in retreating."[2]

[Footnote 1: Dr. RAMSAY, the historian of South Carolina, with his usual frankness and impartiality,
closes his narrative of this siege with the following remark. "On the 13th of August the Carolina
regiment had reached Charlestown. Though not one of them had been killed by the enemy, their
number was reduced, fourteen, by disease and accidents."]

[Footnote 2: London Magazine, Vol. XXVII. p. 23.]

"Thus ended the expedition against St. Augustine, to the great disappointment of both Georgia
and Carolina. Many reflections were afterwards thrown out against General Oglethorpe for his
conduct during the whole enterprise. He, on the other hand, declared that he had no confidence
in the Provincials, for that they refused to obey his orders, and abandoned the camp, and returned
home in large numbers, and that the assistance from the fleet failed him in the utmost emergency.
340.]

The difficulties which opposed his success, showed the courage that could meet, and the zeal
that strove to surmount them; and, while we lament the failure, we perceive that it was owing
to untoward circumstances which he could not have foreseen; and disappointments from a quarter
whence he most confidently expected and depended upon continued cooperation and ultimate accomplishment.
II. page 340.]

In a letter to Lord Egmont, by Governor Belcher, dated Boston, May 24th, 1741, is this remark;
"I was heartily sorry for the miscarriage of General Oglethorpe's attempt on Augustine, in
which I could not learn where the mistake was, or to what it was owing, unless to a wrong judgment
of the strength of the place, to which the force that attacked it, they say, was by no means
equal. I wish that a part of Admiral Vernon's fleet and General Wentworth's forces may give
it a visit, before the Spaniards sue for peace. It seems to me absolutely necessary for the
quieting of the English possessions of Carolina and Georgia, that we should reduce Augustine
to the obedience of the British crown, and keep it, as Gibraltar and Mahon."[1]

[Footnote 1: Letter-book of his Excellency JONATHAN BELCHER, in the archives of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, Vol.

Of the year 1741 but few memorials are to be found. Oglethorpe resided principally at Frederica;
but occasionally visited Savannah; and, every where, and at all times, actively exerted his
powers of persuasion, his personal influence, or his delegated authority to reconcile the jarring
contests and restore the social accordance and peace of the community, while with vigilance
and precaution he concerted measures to guard the Colony against the threatening purposes of
the Spaniards. In reference to his peculiar trials and vexatious annoyances, are the following
remarks, copied from a letter of a gentleman at Savannah, deeply read in the early history
of the Colony.[1]

[Footnote 1: WILLIAM B. STEVENS, M.D., letter, October 19,1840.]

"The difficulties with which General Oglethorpe had to contend, were peculiarly onerous and
perplexing, not only with the Spanish foes,--with the restless Indians,--with the clamorous
settlement,--with discontented troops,--with meagre supplies,--with the defection of Carolina,--with
the protest of his bills, and with the refusal of a just naval protection;--but the officers
of his regiment were at enmity with him and with each other, and crimination and recrimination
followed, disturbing the peace, and weakening the efficiency of the military corps. At a Court
Martial, held in the early part of January, 1739, composed of thirteen officers, they, in their
letter, dated 12th of January, to the General speak thus--'2d. That we have observed a great
spirit of mutiny among the soldiers, particularly those of Lieutenant Colonel Cochran's company,'
and '3d. That by evidence given in Court, it appears to us that Lieutenant Colonel James Cochran
was in the knowledge of, and concealed a mutiny.' The wonder is, that, with such opposing influences,
and such discordant materials, he effected any thing. That he achieved so much, under such
adverse circumstances, proves him to have been a firm, bold, intrepid, and sagacious man; to
have possessed the most eminent military qualifications, and those sterling virtues which mock
at the petty malice of the envious, and triumph over the machinations of malignity."

He was, also, fully aware that, as the Spanish of Florida and Cuba entertained no good will
towards him, they would seek an opportunity to retaliate his "assault and battery," which,
though it had proved on his part a failure, had been to them a grievous annoyance. He, therefore,
kept scout-boats continually on the look out, to give notice of the approach to the coast of
any armed vessel. On the 16th of August advice was conveyed to him that a large ship had come
to anchor off the bar. He immediately sent out the boat to ascertain what it was; and it was
perceived to be manned with Spaniards, with evidently hostile purpose. Whereupon he went on
board the guard sloop to go in search of her; took, also, the sloop Falcon, which was in the
service of the Province; and hired the schooner Norfolk, Captain Davis, to join the expedition.
These vessels were manned by a detachment of his regiment under the following officers: viz.:
Major Alexander Heron, Captain Desbrisay, Lieutenant Mackay, Lieutenant Tamser, Ensign Hogan,
Ensign Sterling, and Ensigns Wemyss and Howarth, and Adjutant Maxwell; Thomas Eyre, Surgeon
and Mate; six sergeants, six corporals, five drummers, and one hundred and twenty-five privates.
Before they could get down to the bar, a sudden squall of wind and storm of thunder and rain
came on; and when it cleared up the vessel was out of sight.

Unwilling, however, to lose the object of this equipment, on the next day he sailed directly
towards St. Augustine in pursuit of the ship. On the 19th the Falcon sloop, being disabled,
was sent back, with seventeen men of the regiment; and the General proceeded with the guard
sloop and schooner. On the 21st, by day-break, they discovered a ship and a sloop at anchor,
about four or five leagues distant; and, it being a dead calm, they rowed, till they came up
to them, about noon, when they found one to be the black Spanish privateer sloop, commanded
by a French officer, Captain Destrade, who had made several prizes to the northward; and the
other to be a three-mast ship; both lying at anchor outside of the bar of St. Augustine. The
General issued orders to board them, when the wind freshing up, and the English bearing down
upon them, they began firing with great and small arms, and the English returning the fire,
they immediately left their anchors, and run over the bar. The sloop and schooner pursuing
them; and, though they engaged them for an hour and a quarter, they could not get on board.
The Spanish vessels then run up towards the town; and as they were hulled, and seemed disabled,
six half-galleys came down, and kept firing nine-pounders, but, by reason of the distance,
the shot did not reach the sloop or schooner. That night the General came to anchor within
sight of the castle of St. Augustine, and the next day sailed for the Matanzas; but, finding
no vessel there, cruised off the bar of St. Augustine, and nothing coming out, the whole coast
being thus alarmed, he returned to Frederica.

There were three ships, and one two-mast vessel lying within the harbor at the time that the
English engaged the sloop and ship.[1]

[Footnote 1: Annals of Europe, page 404.]

This summer one of the Georgia boats off Tybee saved a three-mast vessel which the Spaniards
had abandoned, leaving eighteen Englishmen on board, after having barbarously scuttled her,
and choked the pumps, that the men might sink with the ship; but the boat's men, getting on
board in good time, saved the men and the ship.

It seems that the Creeks, in retaliation of some predatory and murderous outrages of the Florida
outposts, made a descent upon them in return. This is referred to in the following extract
from a letter of General Oglethorpe to the Duke of Newcastle, dated

Frederica, 12th of December, 1741.

My Lord,

"Toonahowi, the Indian who had the honor of your Grace's protection in England, with a party
of Creek Indians, returned hither from making an incursion up to the walls of Augustine; near
which they took Don Romualdo Ruiz del Moral, Lieutenant of Spanish horse, and nephew to the
late Governor, and delivered him to me.

"The Governor of Augustine has sent the enclosed letter to me by some English prisoners; and,
the prisoners there, the enclosed petition. On which I fitted out the vessels, and am going
myself, with a detachment of the regiment, off the bar of Augustine, to demand the prisoners,
and restrain the privateers."

In the early part of the year 1742, the Spaniards formed a design upon Georgia, on which, from
the time of its settlement, they had looked with a jealous eye.[1] For this end, in May, they
fitted out an armament at Havanna, consisting of fifty-six sail, and seven or eight thousand
men; but the fleet, being dispersed by a storm, did not all arrive at St. Augustine, the place
of their destination. Don Manuel de Monteano, Governor of that fortress, and of the town and
region it protected, had the command of the expedition.

[Footnote 1: Appendix, No. XXV.]

About the end of May, or beginning of June, the schooner, which had been sent out on a cruise
by General Oglethorpe, returned with the information that there were two Spanish men of war,
with twenty guns each, besides two very large privateers, and a great number of small vessels,
full of troops, lying at anchor off the bar of St. Augustine. This intelligence was soon after
confirmed by Captain Haymer, of the Flamborough man of war, who had fallen in with part of
the Spanish fleet on the coast of Florida, and drove some vessels on shore.

Having been apprized of this, the General, apprehending that the Spaniards had in view some
formidable expedition against Georgia or Carolina, or perhaps both, wrote to the Commander
of his Majesty's ships, in the harbor of Charlestown, urging him to come to his assistance.
Lieutenant Maxwell, the bearer, arrived and delivered the letter on the 12th of June. Directly
afterwards he sent Lieutenant Mackay to Governor Glenn, of South Carolina, requesting his military
aid with all expedition; and this despatch reached him on the 20th. He then laid an embargo
upon all the shipping in Georgia; and sent messages to his faithful Indian allies, who gathered
to his assistance with all readiness.

And now the design of the Spaniards was manifest. On the 21st of June the fleet appeared on
the coast; and nine sail of vessels made an attempt on Amelia Island, but were so warmly received
by the cannon from Fort William, and the guard-schooner of fourteen guns and ninety men, commanded
by Captain Dunbar, that they sheered off. When the General was informed of this attack, he
resolved to support the fortifications on Cumberland Island; and set out with a detachment
of the regiment in three boats; but was obliged to make his way through fourteen sail of vessels.
This was very venturesome, and, indeed, was considered as presumptuously hazardous. For, had
a shot from one of the galleys struck the boat in which he was, so as to disable or sink it,
or had he been overtaken by a gun-boat from the enemy, the colonial forces would have become
the weakly resisting victims of Spanish exasperated revenge. But by keeping to the leeward,
and thus taking advantage of the smoke, he escaped the firing and arrived in safety.

After having withdrawn the command from St. Andrews, and removed the stores and artillery that
were there, and reinforced Fort William,[1] where he left one of the boats, he returned to
St. Simons.

[Footnote 1: These two Forts were on Cumberland Island.]

He now sent another express to the Governor of South Carolina, by Mr. Malryne, informing him
of his situation, and urging the necessity of a reinforcement. This application was not promptly
complied with, in consequence of an unfortunate prejudice arising from the failure of his attempt
upon St. Augustine. But as Georgia had been a great barrier against the Spaniards, whose conquest
of it would be hazardous to the peace and prosperity of South Carolina, "it was thought expedient
to fit out some vessels to cruise down the coast, and see what could be done for its relief."[1]

[Footnote 1: WILLIAMS's History of Florida, p. 185.]

In the perilous emergency to which he was reduced, Oglethorpe took, for the King's service,
the merchant ship of twenty guns, called the Success,--a name of auspicious omen,--commanded
by Captain Thompson, and manned it from the small vessels which were of no force. He also called
in the Highland company from Darien, commanded by Captain McIntosh; the company of rangers;
and Captain Carr's company of marines.

On the 28th of June the Spanish fleet appeared off the bar below St. Simons; but from their
precaution for taking the soundings and ascertaining the channel, was delayed coming in, or
landing any of the troops, for several days; in which time "the General raised another troop
of rangers; and, by rewarding those who did extraordinary duty, and offering advancement to
such as should signalize themselves on this occasion, he kept up the spirits of the people,
and increased the number of enlistments."[1] He was placed, indeed, in a most critical situation;
but he bore himself with great presence of mind, and summoned to the emergency a resolution
which difficulties could not shake, and brought into exercise energies which gathered vigor
from hindrance, and rendered him insensible to fatigue, and unappalled by danger. This self-collected
and firm state of mind, made apparent in his deportment and measures, produced a corresponding
intrepidity in all around him; inspired them with confidence in their leader; and roused the
determined purpose with united efforts to repel their invaders.

[Footnote 1: The passages distinguished by inverted commas, without direct marginal reference,
are from the official account.]

At this critical juncture, his own services were multiplied and arduous; for Lieutenant Colonel
Cook, who was Engineer, having gone to Charlestown, on his way to London,[1] the General was
obliged to execute that office himself, sometimes on ship-board, and sometimes at the batteries.
He therefore found himself under the necessity of assigning the command to some one on station,
during his occasional absences; and accordingly appointed Major Alexander Heron; raising him
to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

[Footnote 1: We shall see, in the sequel, that the absence of this officer, whatever its pretence,
was with treacherous purpose, as may be surmised by the following extract from a letter to
the Duke of Newcastle, dated 30th of July, 1741; where, mentioning the despatches sent to Governor
Glen, earnestly requesting some military aid, the General informs his Grace that "Lieutenant
Colonel Cook, who was engineer, and was then at Charlestown, hastened away to England; and
his son-in-law, Ensign Erye, sub-engineer, was also in Charlestown, and did not arrive here
till the action was over; so, for want of help, I was obliged to do the duty of an engineer."]

On Monday, the 5th of July, with a leading gale and the flood of tide, a Spanish fleet of thirty-six
sail, consisting of three ships of twenty guns, two large snows, three schooners, four sloops,
and the rest half-galleys, with landsmen on board, entered the harbor; and, after exchanging
a brisk fire with the fort, for four hours, passed all the batteries and shipping, proceeded
up the river. The same evening the forces were landed upon the island, a little below Gascoigne's
plantation. A red flag was hoisted on the mizzen-top of the Admiral's ship, and a battery was
erected on the shore, in which were planted twenty eighteen-pounders. On this, the General,
having done all he could to annoy the enemy, and prevent their landing, and finding that the
Fort at St. Simons had become indefensible, held a council of war at the head of his regiment;
and it was the opinion of the whole that the fort should be dismantled, the guns spiked up,
the cohorns burst, and that the troops there stationed should immediately repair to Frederica,
for its defence. He accordingly gave orders for them to march, and sent for all the troops
that were on board the vessels to come on shore.

Detachments of the Spaniards made several attempts to pierce through the woods, with a view
to attack the fort; but were repulsed by lurking Indians. The only access to the town was what
had been cut through a dense oak wood, and then led on the skirt of the forest along the border
of the eastern marsh that bounded the island eastward. This was a defile so narrow, that the
enemy could take no cannon with them, nor baggage, and could only proceed two abreast. Moreover,
the Spanish battalions met with such obstruction from the deep morasses on one side, and the
dark and tangled thickets on the other, and such opposition from the Indians and ambushed Highlanders,
that every effort failed, with considerable loss.

On the morning of the 7th of July, Captain Noble Jones, with a small detachment of regulars
and Indians, being on a scouting party, fell in with a number of Spaniards, who had been sent
to reconnoitre the route, and see if the way was clear, surprised and made prisoners of them.
From these, information was received that the main army was on the march. This intelligence
was immediately communicated, by an Indian runner, to the General, who detached Captain Dunbar
with a company of grenadiers, to join the regulars; with orders to harass the enemy on their
way. Perceiving that the most vigorous resistance was called for, with his usual promptitude
he took with him the Highland company, then under arms, and the Indians, and ordered four platoons
of the regiment to follow. They came up with the vanguard of the enemy about two miles from
the town, as they entered the savannah, and attacked them so briskly that they were soon defeated,
and most of their party, which consisted of one hundred and twenty of their best woodsmen and
forty Florida Indians were killed or taken prisoners. The General took two prisoners with his
own hands; and Lieutenant Scroggs, of the rangers, took Captain Sebastian Sachio, who commanded
the party. During the action Toonahowi, the nephew of Tomo Chichi, who had command of one hundred
Indians, was shot through the right arm by Captain Mageleto, which, so far from dismaying the
young warrior, only fired his revenge. He ran up to the Captain, drew his pistol with his left
hand, shot him through the head, and, leaving him dead on the spot, returned to his company.[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, XII. 497.]

The General pursued the fugitives more than a mile, and then halted on an advantageous piece
of ground, for the rest of the troops to come up, when he posted them, with the Highlanders,
in a wood fronting the road through the plain by which the main body of the Spaniards, who
were advancing, must necessarily pass. After which he returned, with all speed, to Frederica,
and ordered the rangers and boat-men to make ready, and all to use their utmost endeavors to
resist the invaders.

During his temporary absence on this pressing emergency, Captain Antonio Barba, and two other
Captains with one hundred grenadiers, and two hundred foot, besides Indians and negroes, advanced
from the Spanish camp into the savannah with drums and huzzas, and halted within an hundred
paces of the position where the troops left by Oglethorpe lay in ambuscade. They immediately
stacked their arms, made fires, and were preparing their kettles for cooking, when a horse
observed some of the concealed party, and, frightened at the uniform of the regulars, began
to snort. This gave the alarm. The Spaniards ran to their arms, but were shot down in great
numbers by their invisible assailants; and, after repeated attempts to form, in which some
of their principal officers fell, they decamped with the utmost precipitation, leaving the
camp equipage on the field. So complete was the surprise, that many fled without their arms;
others, in a rapid retreat, discharged their muskets over their shoulders at their pursuers;
and many were killed by the loaded muskets that had been left on the ground. Generally the
Spaniards fired so much at random, that the trees were pruned by the balls from their muskets.[1]

[Footnote 1: McCALL's History, I. 185.]

The General, returning with all expedition, heard the report of the musketry, and rode towards
it; and, near two miles from the place of action, met some platoons, who, in the heat of the
fight, the air being so darkened by the smoke that they could not see where to direct their
fire, and a heavy shower of rain falling, had retired in disorder. He ordered them to rally
and follow him, apprehending that immediate relief might be wanting. He arrived just as the
battle ceased; and found that Lieutenant Sutherland, with his platoon, and Lieutenant Charles
Mackay, had entirely defeated the enemy.

In this action Don Antonio de Barba, their leader, was made a prisoner, but mortally wounded.
"In both actions, the Spaniards lost four captains, one Lieutenant, two sergeants, two drummers,
and more than an hundred and fifty privates. One captain, one corporal, and twenty men were
taken prisoners. The rest fled to the woods, where many of them were killed by the Indians,
who brought in their scalps."[1]

[Footnote 1: From the great slaughter, the scene of this action has ever since been called
"the bloody marsh."]

Captain Demerey and ensign Gibbon being arrived, with the men they had rallied, Lieutenant
Cadogan with the advanced party of the regiment, and soon after the whole regiment, Indians
and rangers, the General marched down to a causeway over a marsh, very near the Spanish camp,
over which all were obliged now to pass; and thereby stopped those who had been dispersed in
the fight, from getting back to the Spanish camp. Having passed the night there, the Indian
scouts in the morning got so near the Spanish place of encampment, as to ascertain that they
had all retired into the ruins of the fort, and were making intrenchments under shelter of
the cannon of the ships. Not deeming it prudent to attack them while thus defended, he marched
back to Frederica, to refresh the soldiers; and sent out parties of Indians and rangers to
harass the enemy. He now, at a general staff, appointed Lieutenant Hugh Mackay and Lieutenant
Maxwell, Aids de camp, and Lieutenant Sutherland, Brigade Major.

While signal instances of heroism were thus honored, he warned the troops of the necessity
of union and vigilance, of prompt attention to orders, and of maintaining an unflinching firmness
in every emergency; for in these, under God, depended their safety.

Although he thus encouraged others, he was himself filled with perplexity. He began to despair
of any help from Carolina. His provisions were bad and scarce, and, while the enemy commanded
the river and the harbor, no supplies could be expected. Of all this, however, he gave no intimation,
but, firm and self-possessed, submitted to the same fare with the meanest soldier, exposed
himself to as great fatigue, and often underwent greater privations. At the same time his fixed
resolution and irrepressible zeal in the defence and protection of his people, nerved him to
further and even greater exertions.

On the 11th the great galley and two small ones, approached within gun-shot of the town; but
they were repulsed by guns and bombs from the fort, and the General followed them in his cutter,
with attendant boats, well manned, till he got under the cannon of their ships, which lay in
the sound.

This naval approach, as appeared afterwards, was in consequence of a concerted plot. It seems
that, at the commencement of the siege of St. Augustine, a Spanish officer quitted one of the
outer forts and surrendered himself to Oglethorpe, who detained him prisoner of war. He was
readily communicative, and gave what was supposed important information. After the close of
the war, he might have been exchanged; but he chose to remain, pretending that the Spaniards
looked upon him as a traitor. He, at length, so artfully insinuated himself into favor with
the magnanimous Oglethorpe, that he was treated with great courtesy. On this invasion he begged
permission to retire into the northern colonies of the English, saying that he apprehended
that if he should fall into the hands of the Spaniards, they would deal rigorously with him.
The General, not being aware of any treacherous design, gave him a canoe to go up the river
till he was out of danger; whence he might proceed by land to some back settlement. Some days
past and he came back to Frederica, pretending that he could not make his way through, nor
by, the fleet without being discovered and captured. Most fortunately, some days after his
return, an English prisoner, who had escaped from one of the ships of war, acquainted the General
with the treachery of this officer, assuring him that he had been aboard at such a time, and
talked over his insidious project of setting fire to the arsenal which contained all the powder
and military stores, and that its explosion should be the signal to the Spanish galleys to
approach, and, in the confusion of the occasion, make an assault upon the fort. This disclosure
confirmed suspicions which had been excited by some of his management since his return; and
he was put under guard. In consequence of this precaution, the concerted signal could not be
given; and the ruinous project was most happily defeated.[1]

[Footnote 1: URLSPURGER, IV. p. 1260.]

July 12th, two English prisoners who had effected an escape, one from the fleet, and one from
the camp, informed the General that the Spaniards, not having anticipated such vigorous resistance,
had become restless and dispirited, especially since they had ascertained by their roll how
great was their loss of men; and that the state of the wounded was distressing. They added
that these discomfitures were increased by the want of water on board the ships, which was
so great that the troops were put upon half allowance, which, in this hot weather was a grievous
deprivation, and that several, from the effect of the climate, were sick and unfit for service.
They apprized him, also, that they had holden a council of war, in which there were great divisions,
insomuch that the troops of Cuba separated from those of Augustine, and encamped at a distance
near the woods.

This latter circumstance suggested the idea of attacking them while divided; and his perfect
knowledge of the woods favored the project of surprising one of their encampments. While he
was using the utmost circumspection to obtain the necessary information without being discovered,
an occurrence of the most villanous nature, disconcerted the project. As the particulars of
this have been variously narrated, I am happy in being enabled to give the General's own account
of the affair.[1] In his official despatch to the Duke of Newcastle, dated at Frederica, in
Georgia, 30th of July, 1742, he says,--"A Frenchman who, without my knowledge was come down
among the volunteers, fired his gun, and deserted. Our Indians in vain pursued, but could not
take him. Upon this, concluding that we should be discovered, I divided the drums into different
parts, and they beat the Grenadier's march for about half an hour; then ceased, and we marched
back in silence. The next day I prevailed with a prisoner, and gave him a sum of money to carry
a letter privately, and deliver it to that Frenchman who had deserted. The Spanish prisoner
got into their camp, and was immediately carried before the General, Don Manuel de Monteano.
He was asked how he escaped, and whether he had any letters; but denying he had any, was strictly
searched, and the letter found, and he, upon being pardoned, confessed that he had received
money to deliver it to the Frenchman, (for the letter was not directed.) The Frenchman denied
his knowing any thing of the contents of the letter, or having received any money, or correspondence
with me. Notwithstanding which, a council of war was held, and they decreed the Frenchman to
be a double spy; but General Monteano would not suffer him to be executed, having been employed
by him. However they embarked all their troops with such precipitation that they left behind
their cannon, &c., and those dead of their wounds, unburied."

TEFFT, Esq., of Savannah. The particulars of this singularly interesting ruse de guerre are
detailed in all the accounts of the Spanish invasion; and in each with some variation, and
in all rather more circumstantially than the above. See Gentleman's Magazine for 1742, p. 695;

History of the Colonies, p. 289.]

The Spanish General now deemed it expedient to relinquish a plan of conquest attended with
so many difficulties, and the further prosecution of which would put to hazard the loss of
both army and fleet, and perhaps of the whole Province of Florida.

"On the 14th of July the Spaniards burned all the works and houses on the south end of St.
Simons and Jekyl islands.

"On the 15th the large vessels, with the Cuba forces on board, stood out to sea; and the Governor
and troops from St. Augustine embarked in the galleys and small vessels, and took the inland
passage, and encamped on the north end of Cumberland island, at Fort St. Andrews.

"The next day the General pursued the enemy, and, landing where they had encamped, sent an
express in the night to Ensign Alexander Stewart, who commanded at Fort William, directing
him, in case of an attack, to defend the place to the last extremity; and that he would reinforce
him early the next day. At day-light twenty-eight sail of the Spanish line appeared off Fort
William, fourteen of which came into the harbor, and demanded a surrender of the garrison.
Stewart replied that it should not be surrendered, and could not be taken. They attacked the
works from their galleys and other vessels, and attempted to land; but were repulsed by a party
of rangers, who had arrived by a forced march down the island. Stewart, with only sixty men,
defended the fort with such bravery, that, after an assault of three hours, the enemy discovering
the approach of Oglethorpe, put to sea, with considerable loss. Two galleys were disabled and
abandoned; and the Governor of St. Augustine proceeded with his troops by the inward passage.
Ensign Stewart was rewarded, by promotion, for the bravery of his defence."[1]

[Footnote 1: McCall, Vol. I. p.188.]

"On the 20th, General Oglethorpe sent his boats and rangers as far as the river St. John. They
returned the next day with the information that the enemy were quite gone."

A few days after, the armed ships from South Carolina came to St. Simons; but the need of them
was then over; and even of the British men of war upon the American station, though they had
a month's notice, none appeared upon the coast of Georgia until after the Spanish troops were
all embarked, and their fleet was upon its return to Havana and to St. Augustine.

In the account of the Spanish invasion, by the Saltzburg preachers at Ebenezer, are these very
just reflections: "Cheering was the intelligence that the Spaniards, with all their ships of
war and numerous military force, had raised the siege in shame and disgrace, and retired to
Augustine! Doubtless they feared lest English ships of war should approach and draw them into
a naval combat, for which they could have no desire. Nay, they feared, no doubt, that their
own Augustine would suffer from it." Don Manuel de Monteano had been fifteen days on the small
island of St. Simons, without gaining the least advantage over a handful of men; and, in the
several skirmishes, had lost a considerable number of his best troops, while Oglethorpe's loss
was very inconsiderable.[1]

[Footnote 1: McCALL, I. 188.]

The writer of a letter from Charlestown, South Carolina, has this remark; "that nearly five
thousand men, under the command of so good an officer as the Governor of St. Augustine, should
fly before six or seven hundred men, and about one hundred Indians, is matter of astonishment
to all."[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine for 1742, p. 895. See also Appendix, No. XXVII. for an account
of the forces.]

The Rev. Mr. Whitefield, in a letter to a noble Lord, says, "The deliverance of Georgia from
the Spaniards, one of my friends writes me, is such as cannot be paralleled but by some instances
out of the Old Testament. I find that the Spaniards had cast lots, and determined to give no
quarter. They intended to have attacked Carolina, but, wanting water, they put into Georgia,
and so would take that Colony on their way. But the race is not to the swift, nor the battle
to the strong. Providence ruleth all things. They were wonderfully repelled and sent away before
our ships were seen."[1] "A little band chased a thousand; and a small one overcome a large
people."

[Footnote 1: Letters, V.I. let. CCCCLXXXIX. p. 467.]

The writer of the History of the rise, progress, and settlement of the Colony of Georgia, so
often quoted in this chapter, closes his account of this invasion with the following remark:
"Instead of raising and heightening their success, to do honor to the General's character;
we ought rather to lessen or diminish some of the circumstances, to render it, in such an age
as this, more credible. But we have taken no liberties at all. The facts are represented, step
by step, as they happened; and the reader left to make his own inferences, estimate, and opinion."[1]

[Footnote 1: HARRIS's Voyages, II.

In the beginning of the year 1743, General Oglethorpe, having had information that the Spaniards
of St. Augustine were making preparations for another invasion of Georgia,[1] took measures
to repel it; and set out, at the head of a force consisting of a company of grenadiers, a detachment
of his own regiment, the Highlanders, and the Georgia rangers, and a numerous collection of
Indians.

[Footnote 1: "They were so apprehensive of this at South Carolina, that the fortifications
of Charlestown were repaired and augmented." BOYSE's Historical Review, Vol. I. p. 381.]

He came very near being killed in his shallop, while sailing to reconnoitre St. Augustine;
but Providence averted the fatality of the blow which he received. One of his cannon burst,
and a piece of a sail-yard struck the head of the General, and so wounded him that the blood
gushed from his ears and nose. The injury, happily, was not so great but that he soon collected
himself, and cheered up his alarmed attendants.[1]

[Footnote 1: URLSPURGER, IV. 2073.]

On the 6th of March he landed on the Florida side of St. John's river, and attacked a much
more numerous party of the Spanish troops than that under his command, quartered at Fort Diego,
forty of whom were killed in the engagement and pursuit, and the rest made their escape into
the castle.

After this he proceeded to the neighborhood of St. Augustine; and, having placed the greatest
part of his troops in ambuscade, marched with the rest almost to the walls of the fortress,
in hopes that the Spaniards, upon seeing so small a party, would have sallied out to have engaged
it, in which case he was resolved to have made a retreating fight, in order to draw the enemy
into the ambush which he had prepared for them. But, it seems, that by accident they discovered
the concealment of the troops, and deemed it prudent to remain in their stronghold. This stratagem
having been frustrated, Oglethorpe, perceiving that an assault would be unavailing, marched
back to the river, where he continued for some time, expecting that the enemy would come out,
and endeavor to drive him from their territory, but, as they made not the attempt, and as the
affairs of the Colony as well as his own, required his presence in England, he returned, to
make arrangements for going thither.

Having seen that the fortifications on St. Simons and the other islands were repaired and greatly
improved, Oglethorpe took passage on the 23d of July, 1743, in the guard-ship commanded by
Captain Thompson, having with him Colonel Heron, Mr. Eyre, sub-engineer, and several others
belonging to the regiment, and arrived in London on the 25th of September, where his personal
presence was required to meet and answer an impeachment lodged against him in the War-office
by Lieutenant Colonel William Cook. As soon as Oglethorpe arrived, he insisted that the allegations
should be examined by a board of General Officers; but, as Cook gave in a list of several persons
in Georgia and some in South Carolina, who, he said, were material witnesses, no investigation
could be had till they should be heard. In consequence of this, and other delays, the Court
Martial was not opened till the 4th of June, 1744. It continued two days in session; when,
after a strict scrutiny into the complaint, article by article of the nineteen specific charges,
the board were of opinion that "the whole and every article thereof was groundless, false,
and malicious." On the presentation of the Report to his Majesty he was pleased to order that
the said Lieutenant Colonel Cook should be dismissed the service.

This indictment by one who had been treated with great kindness, and who owed his preferment
to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel to the particular favor of the General, was not only ungrateful,
but insidious and base.

The faithful Annalist of America, the Reverend Doctor Holmes, closes his reference to this
transaction with this just and honorable reflection: "By the decision of this board, the character
of this able General now appeared in resplendent light; and his contemporaries acknowledged,
what impartial history must record, that to him Carolina was indebted for her safety and repose,
as well as Georgia for existence and protection."[1]

[Footnote 1: American Annals, II. 19.]

And here closes the history of the settlement of Georgia; in a great degree the project and
the furtherance of one man, who must be allowed to possess the foremost rank among those, who,
by well-concerted plans, and judicious and persevering measures for their accomplishment, have
high claims on public gratitude, as warm and devoted patriots, and enlightened philanthropists.
Embracing in one comprehensive view the effectual relief of the reduced or neglected, the planting
of a Colony, and the promotion of its progressive improvement and welfare, it is the appropriate
praise of the founder of Georgia, that, with a sagacity and foresight which are never sufficiently
to be admired, a zeal and fortitude never exceeded, and a devotedness to the object which never
relaxed, he commenced and carried on the arduous enterprise.

"A Gentleman who may be justly termed the Romulus, father and founder of Georgia; a gentleman
who, without any view but that of enlarging his Majesty's dominions, propagating the Protestant
religion, promoting the trade of his country, and providing for the wants and necessities of
indigent christians, has voluntarily banished himself from the pleasures of a Court, and exposed
himself repeatedly to the dangers of the vast Atlantic ocean in several perilous and tedious
voyages; instead of allowing himself the satisfaction which a plentiful fortune, powerful friends,
and great merit entitle him to in England, has inured himself to the greatest hardships that
any the meanest inhabitant of this new Colony could be exposed to; his diet has been mouldy
bread, or boiled rice instead of bread, salt beef, pork, &c., his drink has been water; and
his bed the damp earth, without any other covering than the canopy of heaven to shelter him:
and all this to set an example to this new Colony how they might bear with such hardships in
their new settlement."

A recent publication bestows also a tribute of commendation, in the following terms: "As governor
of the new Colony, he was exposed to numberless difficulties and vexations; but persevered
with great ardor in the scheme, and expended large sums out of his private fortune with a view
to ensure its success."[1]

[Footnote 1: GEORGIAN AERA; or Memoirs of the most eminent persons who have flourished in Great
Britain from the accession of George I. to the death of George IV. Lond. 1834. 4 vol. Vol.
II. p. 43.]

I give, also, an extract from "lines to General Oglethorpe, on the settlement of Georgia,"
published in the South Carolina Gazette, June, 1733.

  "The fame of Tyrants should, if justice swayed,
  Be bowled through deserts their ambition made;
  But OGLETHORPE has gained a well-earned praise,
  Who made the heirs of want, the lords of ease:
  The gloomy wood to plenteous harvests changed,
  And founded cities where the wild beasts ranged.
  Then may the great reward assigned by fate
  Crown his own wish to see the work complete!"

Having accomplished the great design of settling the Colony of Georgia, watched over its nascent
feebleness, cherished its growth, defended it from invasion, vindicated its rights, and advanced
its interests and welfare, Oglethorpe resigned the superintendence and government into other
hands, and retired to his country seat at Godalming, "to rest under the shade of his own laurels."

In March, 1744, he was appointed one of the officers under Field Marshal, the Earl of Stair,
to oppose the expected invasion from France.

Having been so happy as to form a tender attachment to an amiable lady, which was reciprocated,
he married, on the 15th of September, 1744, Elizabeth, the only daughter of Sir Nathan Wright,
Baronet, of Cranham Hall, Essex.[1]

[Footnote 1: On this occasion some congratulatory verses were written by the Rev. MOSES BROWN,
and printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. XIV. p. 558.]

His chief residence was at his country seat; but he spent his winters in the venerable family
mansion in St. James, Westminster, London, to attend his duties as member of Parliament and
enjoy the society of men of the first respectability for rank, talents, and literature.

On the 25th of March, 1745, he was promoted to the rank of Major General; and the Rebellion
breaking out in that year, he was placed at the head of four companies of cavalry, one of which
bore the title of "Georgia Rangers."[1] They had been raised at the expense of some loyal individuals,
to act against the insurgents; "and," (says an Historian who had the best authority for the
declaration,)[2] "they did very signal service to their country." Their uniform was blue, faced
with red; and they wore green cockades. They did not encamp with the foot, but were quartered
in the towns.

[Footnote 1: Marshal Wade, the Commander in Chief, had under him the following officers, viz.:
Lieutenant Generals Lord Tyrawly, and Wentworth; the Major Generals Howard, Huske, and Oglethorpe;
and the Brigadier Generals Mordaunt and Chemondelly.]

[Footnote 2: See Impartial History of the Rebellion in 1745, from authentic memoirs, particularly
the Journal of a General Officer; and other original papers; with the characters of the persons
principally concerned. By SAMUEL BOYSE. 8vo. Dublin. 1748. p. 80.]

As this expedition was commenced late in the fall, the King's troops were retarded in their
operations by the rigor of the season, their late forced marches, and a most uncomfortable
diarrhoea, which prevailed among the soldiers; but good quarters, proper refreshments, and
the extraordinary care of their officers, relieved these difficulties, and put the army into
so good a condition as enabled them to go through the campaign with fewer inconveniences and
much less loss than could reasonably be expected, considering the great hardships and excessive
fatigues to which they were exposed.

As soon as Marshal Wade had intelligence at Newcastle of the route which the rebels had taken,
he resolved, notwithstanding the severity of the season, to march thence to the relief of Carlisle.
Accordingly, on the 16th of November, the army began to move for that purpose. His Excellency
intended to have begun his march as soon as it was light; but, moving from the left, the troops
which had the van, delayed their motions several hours, to the great prejudice of the expedition;
for the weather being extremely cold, and the travelling impeded by a deep snow, or made rough
by frozen ground, the troops suffered very much. The Major Generals Howard and Oglethorpe,
and the Brigadiers, Cholmondley and Mordaunt, marched on foot at the head of the infantry to
encourage the soldiers. It was eight at night and very dark before the front line got into
the camp at Ovington; and though the soldiers resolutely pressed forward, yet, the roads being
terribly broken and full of ice, it was foreseen that many of the last column might drop, through
excessive fatigue; and therefore the Major Generals Huske and Oglethorpe sent out countrymen
with lights and carts to assist the rear guard, and bring up the tired men. In this service
they were employed till near nine the next morning.

On the 17th the Marshal continued his march to Hexham, where he arrived, with the first line,
about four in the afternoon, but the rear of the army did not come up till near midnight. Having
received intelligence that Carlisle had surrendered, he resolved to march back to Newcastle;
but, the weather continuing bad, and the roads become in a manner impassable, he did not arrive
there with his army till the 16th; and, even then, the forces under his command were so exhausted
by fatigue, and lamed by travelling, that, if it had not been for the great care taken of them
by the people of Newcastle, they must have been, not only disheartened, but disqualified for
service.

In the meantime the Duke of Cumberland's army was forming in Staffordshire; for, upon the approach
of the Rebels, it was resolved that his Royal Highness should be sent down to command the forces
in that part of the kingdom; and he arrived at Litchfield on the 28th of November.

Towards the latter end of the month, the army, under the command of Marshal Wade, began to
move; the cavalry having reached Darlington and Richmond by the 25th. On the 29th the infantry
was at Persbridge, whence he proposed to march to Wetherby, and there canton the whole army
in the adjacent villages; looking upon this as the most convenient station either for distressing
the enemy, should they attempt to retire, or for cooperating with the forces of his Royal Highness,
as occasion should render necessary.

On the 8th of December the Marshal held a council of war, at Ferry-bridge, to consider of the
most effectual means for cutting off the Highlanders on their retreat; and, in this council
it was resolved to march directly to Wakefield and Halifax into Lancashire, as the most likely
way of intercepting the rebels. Having arrived at Wakefield on the 10th, and having advice
that the main body of the rebels was at Manchester, and their van-guard moving from thence
towards Preston, and finding that it was now impossible to come up with them, he judged it
unnecessary to fatigue the forces by hard marches, and, therefore, detaching Major General
Oglethorpe, on the 11th, with the cavalry under his command, he began the march, with the rest
of the forces to Newcastle. On the 13th a great body of the horse and dragoons under Oglethorpe
arrived at Preston, having marched a hundred miles in three days over roads naturally bad,
and at that time almost impassable with snow and ice; "which," says the Historian, "was a noble
testimony of zeal and spirit, especially in the new raised forces."

His Royal Highness immediately gave his orders for continuing the pursuit of the rebels, with
the utmost diligence. Accordingly Oglethorpe advanced towards Lancaster; which place the Duke
reached on the 16th. Oglethorpe, continuing his pursuit at the heels of the rebels, arrived
on the 17th in front of a village called Shap, where their rear was supposed to be, just before
night-fall, in very bad weather. Here he held a consultation with his officers, in which it
was decided that the lateness of the hour, and the exhaustion of the troops, rendered it inexpedient
to make the attack that night. He, therefore, entered the neighboring village to obtain forage,
and to refresh. Meanwhile the Duke pressed on; and, next morning, when he came to Shap, found
that it had been abandoned by the rebels; but was surprised at seeing on his right, towards
the rear, an unexpected body of troops. It turned out to be Oglethorpe's corps, which, from
being the van-guard of the army, had thus unaccountably become the rear. Vexed at the disappointing
occurrence, he caused Oglethorpe to be arraigned before a Court Martial, for having "lingered
on the road." His trial came on at the Horse-guards on the 29th of September, and ended the
7th of October, 1746; when "he was honorably acquitted, and his Majesty was graciously pleased
to confirm the sentence."[1]

[Footnote 1: See London Gazette for October 20th, 1746; and the Memoir in European Magazine
for 1785.

CROKER, in a note to his edition of BOSWELL's Life of Johnson, Vol. I. page 97, says that "though
acquitted, he was never again employed. It is by no means surprising that this neglect should
have mortified a man of Oglethorpe's sensibility; and it is to be inferred, from Mr. Boswell's
expressions, that, late in life, he had in vain solicited for 'some mark of distinction, 'to
heal his wounded feelings." The last intimations are confuted by the advancements in military
rank stated in the following pages of these memorials. The "mark of distinction," deserved,
perhaps expected, but certainly not "solicited," might be that of Knight, a title worn by his
father, as also by the father of his wife.]

As a still higher proof that he stood high in public estimation, on the 13th of September,
1747, he was made Brigadier General in the British army.

On the establishment of the British Herring Fishery, in 1750, he took a very considerable part,
and became one of the Council; in which situation, on the 25th of October he delivered to the
Prince of Wales the Charter of incorporation in a speech which was printed in the public journals.

In 1754 he was candidate for the borough of Haslemere, which he had represented in former Parliaments;
but on the close of the poll, the numbers were found to be for J. Moore Molyneaux, 75; Philip
Carteret Webb, 76; Peter Burrel, 46; and Oglethorpe only 45.

On February 22d, 1765, he was raised to the rank of General of all his Majesty's forces; and
for many years before his death was the oldest general officer on the staff.[1]

[Footnote 1: In the Army list, issued from the War Office, 20th July, 1781, and in STOCKDALE's
Calendar for the year 1785, (the year of Oglethorpe's death,) both of which are now before
me, his name is first on the list.]

Here, perhaps, is the proper place to introduce an anecdote given by Major McCall, in his History
of Georgia, Vol. I. p. 325, too striking to be omitted. "At the commencement of the American
Revolution, being the senior officer of Sir William Howe, he had the prior offer of the command
of the forces appointed to subdue the Rebels. He professed his readiness to accept the appointment,
'if the Ministry would authorize him to assure the Colonies that justice should be done them.'
His proposal appeared to be the result of humanity and equity. He declared that 'he knew the
Americans well; that they never would be subdued by arms; but that obedience would be secured
by doing them justice.' A man with these views was not a fit instrument for the British Government,
and therefore, agreeably to his own request, he was permitted to remain at home."

McCALL refers to "the Annual Register," for his authority; but, after careful searching, I
do not find the statement. The intermediate comments, and the last sentence, are undoubtedly
the Major's. The anecdote is also related in RAMSAY's History of the United States, Vol. III.
p. 166.

I much doubt, however, that an official offer was made to him, as he was too old to engage
in such a service; and deem the statement not sufficiently authenticated to be relied on.

He continued to reside, principally, at Cranham Hall, in Essex, a fine country seat of which
he became possessed by his marriage with the heiress of Sir Nathan Wright. In this beautiful
retreat, favored with the enjoyment of uninterrupted health, the possession of worldly competence,
and the heart-cheering comforts of connubial life, he looked back upon the chequered scene
of his former services with lively gratitude that he had escaped so many dangers, and been
an honored instrument of effecting so much good; and the present happy condition of his lot
was heightened by its contrast with past hardships, fatigues, and perils.

He passed his winters in London, where he enjoyed the acquaintance and even intimacy of some
of the most honorable and distinguished characters of the day. "A gentleman and a soldier,
he united the virtue of chivalrous honor and magnanimity with the acquirements of learning
and that love of polite literature which associated him with the first scholars of the age."
I. p. 97, of CROKER'S edition.]

To the celebrated Dr. Johnson he was respectfully attached; and was fond of having him often
as a guest. III. p. 225.]

Dr. Warton, referring to Oglethorpe, says, "I had the pleasure of knowing him well;" and, in
a note upon the couplet quoted from Pope, says, "Here are lines that will justly confer immortality
on a man who well deserved so magnificent an eulogium. He was, at once, a great hero, and a
great legislator. The vigor of his mind and body have seldom been equalled. The vivacity of
his genius continued to great old age. The variety of his adventures, and the very different
scenes in which he had been engaged, made me regret that his life has never been written. Dr.
Johnson once offered to do it, if the General would furnish him the materials. Johnson had
a great regard for him, for he was one of the first persons that highly, in all companies,
praised his 'London.' His first campaign was made under Prince Eugene against the Turks, and
that great General always spoke of Oglethorpe in the highest terms. But his settlement of the
Colony of Georgia gave a greater lustre to his character than even his military exploits."

With Goldsmith, too, he was intimate. In the lately published biography of this poet by Prior,[1]
referring to the occasional relief contributed to him in his exigences, it is added, "Goldsmith
was content, likewise, to be made the channel of conveyance for the bounty of others, as we
find by a letter of General Oglethorpe, a distinguished and amiable man, at whose table he
met with good society, and spent many agreeable hours, and who now, at an advanced period of
life, displayed the same love for the good of mankind, in a private way, that he had exerted
on a more extended scale." With the letter he sent five pounds, to be distributed in aid of
a charitable institution, in whose behalf Goldsmith seems to have taken an active interest;
and the letter concluded with this kindly expressed invitation; "If a farm, and a mere country
scene will be a little refreshment from the smoke of London, we shall be glad of the happiness
of seeing you at Cranham Hall."

[Footnote 1: Vol. II. p. 457.]

It is asserted that "his private benevolence was great. The families of his tenants and dependants
were sure of his assistance whilst they deserved it; and he has frequently supported a tenant,
whose situation was doubtful, not merely forbearing to ask for rent, but lending him money
to go on with his farm."[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine for July, 1785, p. 518.]

Of his public liberality, repeated mention has been made in the course of this work, more particularly
in the settlement of Georgia; in the furtherance of which he not only bore his own expenses,
but procured various outfits. He also contributed pecuniary assistance and conferred favors
to encourage exertion, or reward well doing. No one excelled him in those smaller attentions
to the interests and gratification of his friends and acquaintance; which, though they do not
of themselves constitute a great character, are, certainly, very pleasing recommendations of it.

It is not denied that he had his imperfections and errors; and some, for which the plea of
human frailty alone may not be a sufficient excuse. He was rather passionate in his temper,
impatient of contradiction, and quick in his resentments; but, upon any ingenuous concession,
was placable and ready to admit an apology. To the humble offender he was reconcilable, and
to the submissive, magnanimous. In the heyday of life, a soldierly pride, or military point
of honor, sometimes betrayed him into indiscretions or involved him in rencounters, to which,
as he became more mature in age and in judgment, a dignified sense of true greatness rendered
him superior. Some instances of rashness have been noted by Walpole with unsparing vituperation;[1]
and some self-complacent or boasting sallies, have been pointed at by Croker with a sarcastic
sneer. But, admitting that these were far from being venial faults, yet it would be very uncharitable
now to recall them from the forgetfulness and forgiveness in which they have long been passed
over; especially as they were fully redeemed by noble qualities and beneficent deeds. Surely,
he who was celebrated by Pope and Thompson, honored by the Reverend Dr. Burton, vindicated
and praised in Parliament by the excellent Duke of Argyle, and favored by the regards of Dr.
Johnson, "the English moralist,"[2] must have had a large prevalence of what, in the opinion
of the best judges, is estimable in disposition and conduct, and irreproachable in character!

[Footnote 1: "All the stories of Horace Walpole are to be received with great caution; but
his Reminiscences, above all, written in his dotage, teem with the grossest inaccuracies and
incredible assertions." LORD MAHON'S History of England. Lond. 1837. Vol. II. p. 174, note.]

[Footnote 2: This honored friend he outlived; and, while attending the sale of his library,
February 18th, 1785, the fine characteristic portrait of him was taken by S. Ireland, an engraving
of which makes the frontispiece of this volume.]

He had a pleasing talent at narrative, and when animated by the cheering attention of his friends,
he would give full scope to it. Anecdotes of times past, incidents and scenes of his eventful
life, and occurrences which had passed under his observation, when detailed by him at length,
and set off with his amusing episodical remarks and illustrations, made him a most entertaining
chronicler. These were sometimes enlivened with a sportive humor that gave a charm to the social
hour, and contributed to the amusement of his guests and friends. If in his extreme old age
he indulged in egotisms or loquacity, still his observations were those of one who had seen
and read much, and was willing to communicate his acquired knowledge and the results of his
observation and experience; and few who attended to him, did so without receiving information
and entertainment. Even his old stories of his own acting, served to confirm what he said,
and he made them better in the telling; so that he was rarely troublesome with the same tale
told again, for he gave it an air of freshness.

Polite in his address and graceful in his manners, the gallant veteran was a favorite visiter
in the parties of accomplished ladies that occasionally met at the house of Mrs. Montague,
Mrs. Garrick, Mrs. Boscawen, and Mrs. Carter.--Hannah More, in a letter to her sister, in 1784,
says, "I have got a new admirer; it is the famous General Oglethorpe, perhaps the most remarkable
man of his time. He was foster-brother to the Pretender; and is much above ninety years old;
the finest figure you ever saw. He perfectly realizes all my ideas of Nestor. His literature
is great; his knowledge of the world extensive; and his faculties as bright as ever. He is
one of the three persons still living who were mentioned by Pope; Lord Mansfield and Lord Marchmont
are the other two. He was the intimate friend of Southern, the tragic poet, and all the wits
of that time. He is, perhaps, the oldest man of a Gentleman living. I went to see him the other
day, and he would have entertained me by repeating passages from Sir Eldred. He is quite a
preux chevalier, heroic, romantic, and full of the old gallantry."[1] In another letter, she
mentions being in company with the General at Mrs. Vesey's, where the Dutchess of Portland
and Mrs. Delany were present, and where "Mr. Burke talked a great deal of politics with General
Oglethorpe. He told him, with great truth, that he looked upon him as a more extraordinary
person than any he had ever read of, for he had founded the province of Georgia; had absolutely
called it into existence, and had lived to see it severed from the Empire which created it,
and become an independent State."[2]

[Footnote 1: Life and Letters, Vol. I. p. 181.]

[Footnote 2: Ibid. 204.]

The late President, John Adams, saw Oglethorpe in 1785, a short time before his decease. Within
a day or two after his arrival in London, as Ambassador from the United States, had been announced
in the public prints, the General called upon him; as was very polite and complimentary. "He
had come to pay his respects to the first American Ambassador and his Family, whom he was glad
to see in England; expressed a great esteem and regard for America; much regret at the misunderstanding
between the two countries; and felt very happy to have lived to see the termination of it."[1]
There was something peculiarly interesting in this interview. He who had planted Georgia, and
provided for it during the earliest stages of its dependent condition as a Colony, held converse
with him who had come to a Royal Court, the Representative of its NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE!

[Footnote 1: See a letter from President Adams to Dr. Holmes. Annals, Vol. II. p. 530.]

A writer in the year 1732, and within the month on which the charter for Georgia was issued,
made the following remarks: "If the Trustees give liberty of Religion, establish the people
free, fix an agrarian law, and go upon the glorious maxims of liberty and virtue, their Province,
in the age of a man, by being the asylum of the unfortunate, will become more and more advantageous
to Britain than the conquest of a kingdom."[1] The suggestion here made was seasonable and
judicious; and the prospective intimation was a prophecy, accomplished in a sense not imagined,
and surely not anticipated by the writer. The Province did become, whilst its founder was yet
living, and therefore "in the age of a man," a highly advantageous acquisition to Great Britain
in a commercial relation; and, though dismembered from the Empire, an important independent State.

[Footnote 1: London Magazine for 1732, p. 198.]

This remarkable man, abstemious in his mode of living, regular in his habits, and using much
exercise, enjoyed good health to extreme old age; and such was his activity, that he could
outwalk persons more than half a century younger. At that period of advanced life, when the
weight of years usually bears down the elasticity of the mind, he retained all that spring
of intellect which had characterized the promptitude of earlier days; his bodily senses seemed
but little impaired; and his eye-sight served him to the last.

He died at his seat at Cranham, of a violent fever, 30th of June, 1785.

  "And dropt like Autumn fruit, which, ripening long,
  Was wondered at because it fell no sooner."[1]

[Footnote 1: The library of General Oglethorpe was sold by Calderwood in 1788. It comprised
standard works of Ancient and Modern History, of the Drama, Poetry, and Polite Literature.]

CONCLUDING REMARKS.

The preceding pages have given details of some principal actions and exploits of a very remarkable
man; whose projects, dictated by benevolence and inspired by philanthropy, were all prospective.
Their first, and, apparently, principal object, was to provide relief for the indigent, and
an asylum for the oppressed. Their second, to unite the pensioners on the liberally contributed
bounty, in a social compact for mutual assistance, and a ready cooperation for the general
good. But even this, beneficent as it was, fell short of his aim. He considered himself to
be engaged in forming a Colony, destined to extend and flourish under the salutary principles
of order and justice, and the sustaining sanctions of civil law, and a form of government,
which his breast swelled with the patriotic hope, would be well constituted and wisely administered.

This very statement of the origin of these political institutions, bears on it the indications
of their perpetuity, especially as the freedom obtained for the first emigrants from rigorous
exaction in their native country, was remembered and cherished in that which they settled,
till it formed the constituents of civil liberty, which at length "threw off every yoke," for
the attainment of NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE.

Hence, his agency, services and expenditures in settling the Province of Georgia, his disinterested
devotedness to its establishment and progressive welfare, and his bravery and personal exposure
in its defence, enrolled among the important achievements of his long and eventful life, constitute
the most splendid trophy to his fame, and will ensure to his name a memory as lasting as that
of America itself.

On a mural tablet of white marble, in the chancel of Cranham Church, is the following inscription,
drawn up by CAPEL LOFFT, Esq.

  Near this place lie the remains of
  JAMES EDWARD OGLETHORPE, Esq.
  who served under Prince Eugene,
  and in 1714 was Captain Lieutenant in the
  first troop of the Queen's Guards.
  In 1740 he was appointed Colonel of a Regiment
  to be raised for Georgia.
  In 1745 he was appointed Major General;
  in 1747 Lieutenant General; and
  in 1760, General of his Majesty's forces.
  In his civil station,
  he was very early conspicuous.
  He was chosen Member of Parliament
  for Haslemere in Surry in 1722,
  and continued to represent it till 1754.
  In the Committee of Parliament,
  for inquiring into the state of the gaols,
  formed 25th of February, 1728,
  and of which he was Chairman,
  the active and persevering zeal of his benevolence
  found a truly suitable employment,
  by visiting, with his colleagues of that generous body,
  the dark and pestilential dungeons of the Prisons
  which at that time dishonored the metropolis;
  detecting the most enormous oppressions;
  obtaining exemplary punishment on those who had been
  guilty of such outrage against humanity and justice;
  and redressing multitudes from extreme misery
  to light and freedom.

Of these, about seven hundred, rendered, by long confinement for debt, strangers and helpless
in the country of their birth, and desirous of seeking an asylum in the wilds of America, were
by him conducted thither in 1732.

  He willingly encountered in their behalf
  a variety of fatigue and danger,
  and thus became the founder of
  the Colony of Georgia;
  a Colony which afterwards set the noble example
  of prohibiting the importation of slaves
  This new establishment
  he strenuously and successfully defended
  against a powerful attack of the Spaniards.
  In the year in which he quitted England
  to found this settlement,
  he nobly strove to secure
  our true national defence by sea and land,
  --a free navy--
  without impressing a constitutional militia.
  But his social affections were more enlarged
  than even the term Patriotism can express;
  he was the friend of the oppressed negro,--
  no part of the globe was too remote,--
  no interest too unconnected,--
  or too much opposed to his own,
  to prevent the immediate succor of suffering humanity.
  For such qualities he received,
  from the ever memorable John, Duke of Argyle,
  a full testimony, in the British Senate,
  to his military character,
  his natural generosity,
  his contempt of danger,
  and regard for the Public.
  A similar encomium is perpetuated in a foreign language;[1]
  and, by one of our most celebrated Poets,
  his remembrance is transmitted to posterity
  in lines justly expressive of
  the purity, the ardor, and the extent of his benevolence.
  He lived till the 1st of July, 1785;
  a venerable instance to what a duration
  a life of temperance and virtuous labor
  is capable of being protracted.
  His widow, Elizabeth,
  daughter of Sir Nathan Wright of Cranham hall, Bart.
  and only sister and heiress of Sir Samuel Wright, Bart.
  of the same place,
  surviving, with regret,
  but with due submission to Divine Providence,
  an affectionate husband,
  after an union of more than forty years,
  hath inscribed to his memory
  these faint traces of his excellent character.

  "Religion watches o'er his urn,
  And all the virtues bending mourn;
  Humanity, with languid eye,
  Melting for others' misery;
  Prudence, whose hands a measure hold,
  And Temperance, with a chain of gold;
  Fidelity's triumphant vest,
  And Fortitude in armor drest;
  Wisdom's grey locks, and Freedom, join
  The moral train to bless his shrine,
  And pensive all, around his ashes holy,
  Their last sad honors pay in order melancholy."[2]

Politique.]

MRS. ELIZABETH OGLETHORPE,

WITH EXTRACTS FROM HER WILL.

OBITUARY NOTICE

COPIED FROM THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE FOR 1787, PAGE 1025

October 26th, 1787, died, at her seat, Cranham Hall, Co. Essex,[1] aged 79, Mrs. Elizabeth
Oglethorpe, widow of the late General Oglethorpe. She was daughter of Sir Nathan Wright, Bart.,
(nephew to the Lord Keeper,) by Abigail, his fourth wife, who survived and married Mr. Tryst.
Sir Nathan, by his first wife, (Anne Meyrick) had two sons; Nathan, who succeeded him in title,
and who married a daughter of Sir Francis Lawley, and died in April, 1737; and John, who died
without issue. By his second wife, (Elizabeth Brage) he had a son, Benjamin, who died before
him. By his third wife, (Elizabeth Bowater) he had no issue. By the fourth he had a son, Samuel,
and Mrs. Oglethorpe. Sir Nathan, the son, had one son and two daughters; and the son dying
without issue, his half-brother, Samuel, succeeded to the title and part of the estate. He
dying a bachelor, Mrs. Oglethorpe became his heir, and has died without leaving any child.
September 15, 1744, she married the late General Oglethorpe, who died July 1,1785;[2] and to
her magnanimity and prudence, on an occasion of much difficulty, it was owing that the evening
of their lives was tranquil and pleasant, after a stormy noon. Very many and continual were
her acts of benevolence and charity; but, as she would herself have been hurt by any display
of them in her lifetime, we will say no more. Not to have mentioned them at all would have
been unjust to her memory, and not less so to the world, in which such an example may operate
as an incitement to others to go and do likewise.

[Footnote 1: This old mansion, situated on a pleasant rising ground, was built about the end
of the reign of James I. In the hall is a very fine whole-length picture of Mr. Nathan Wright,
a considerable Spanish merchant in the beginning of Charles the First's time, who resided long
in that country, by Antonio Arias, an eminent painter of Madrid; and the more curious, as perhaps
there is not another picture of that able master in England. Gentleman's Magazine, LV. 518.]

[Footnote 2: The date for the time of the death of General Oglethorpe, which is given on the
296th page of this volume, was taken from the public Gazettes. As it took place late in the
night, it might be rather uncertain as to its being the close of one day or the beginning of
another. But the above, corroborated by the testimony of the monumental inscription, must be
correct. I regret, however, that I did not perceive it sooner. T.M.H.]

By her will, which is very long, and dated May 30, 1786, and has four codicils, the last dated
September 11, 1787, she leaves her estate at Westbrook, in Godalming, Co. Surrey, bequeathed
to her by the General, to his great nephew, Eugene, Marquis of Bellegarde, in France, then
in the Dutch service, but born in England, and his heirs, with all her plate, jewels, &c.;
to her nephews, John and Charles Apreece, and their sister Dorothy, wife of ---- Cole, an annuity
of £100 amongst them, and the survivor for life; and if either John or Charles succeed to the
Baronet's title, the annuity to go over to the other; but if their sister survive, she to have
only £200 per annum; also four annuities, of £50 each, to four of her female friends or neighbors.
All these annuities are charged on the Cranham estate, which she gives in trust to Sir George
Allanson Wynne, Bart., and Mr. Granville Sharpe, for the use of her nephew, Sir Thomas Apreece,
of Washingley, Co. Huntingdon, for life, remainder in tail to his issue male or female, remainder
to his brothers John and Charles, and sister Dorothy, successively, remainder to her own right
heirs. The manor of Canewdon Hall, Essex, to be sold to pay legacies, viz.: £100 to Sir G.A.
Wynne; £1000 to the Princess of Rohan, related to her late husband; £500 to the Princess de
Ligne, her late husband's niece; £1000 to Samuel Crawley, Esq., of Theobalds, Co. Herts; £500
among the Miss Dawes's, of Coventry; £500 to James Fitter, Esq., of Westminster; £500 to the
Marquis of Bellegarde. The manor of Fairstead Hall, Co. Essex, to Granville Sharpe, for life,
paying £50 per annum to his friend Mr. Marriott, relict of General Marriott, of Godalming,
and to settle the said estate to charitable uses after his death, at his discretion. To Edward
Lloyd and Sarah his wife, her servants, £500; and £10 each, to other servants. By a codicil:
to Maria Anne Stephenson £1000 stock out of any of her property in the funds; to Miss Lewis,
who lives with Mrs. Fowle, in Red-lion square, and to Miss Billinghurst, of Godalming, £50
each; to the poor of Cranham, Fairstead, Canewdon, and Godalming, £20 each; her turn of patronage
to the united livings of St. Mary Somerset and St. Mary Mounthaw, in London, to the Rev. Mr.
Herringham, of South Weald. By another codicil, £1000 more to the Marquis of Bellegarde; £1000
to Count Bethisy; £200 to Granville Sharpe. By another, revokes the legacies to the Princess
de Ligne and Count Bethisy, and gives them to the two younger daughters of the Marquis of Bellegarde,
at the age of 21, or marriage. As the Marquis resides in France, and it may be inconvenient
to him to keep the estate, she gives the manors of Westbrook and Brimscombe, and Westbrook-place
in Godalming, in trust to G. Sharpe, and William Gill, Esqrs., and their heirs, to be sold,
and the money paid to the Marquis. Her executors are Mr. Granville Sharpe, and Mrs. Sarah Dickinson,
of Tottenham; the latter residuary legatee.

At the foot of the monument erected to the memory of General Oglethorpe, was added the following
inscription:

    "His disconsolate Widow died October 26,1787,
                   in her 79th year,
                and is buried with him,
       in the vault in the centre of this Chancel.
       Her fortitude of mind and extensive charity
               deserve to be remembered,
       though her own modesty would desire them to
                      be forgotten."

OGLETHORPE'S

ACCOUNT OF

CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.

This article is extracted from SALMON'S Modern History, Vol. III. page 770, 4th edition; where
it is introduced in these words: "The following pages are an answer from General OGLETHORPE
to some inquiries made by the author, concerning the State of Carolina and Georgia."

ACCOUNT OF CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.

Carolina is part of that territory which was originally discovered by Sir Sebastian Cabot.
The English now possess the sea-coast from the river St. John's, in 30 degrees, 21 minutes
north latitude. Westward the King's charter declares it to be bounded by the Pacific ocean.

Carolina is divided into North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia; the latter is a province
which his Majesty has taken out of Carolina, and is the southern and western frontier of that
province, lying between it and the French, Spaniards, and Indians.

The part of Carolina that is settled, is for the most part a flat country. All, near the sea,
is a range of islands, which breaks the fury of the ocean. Within is generally low land for
twenty or twenty-five miles, where the country begins to rise in gentle swellings. At seventy
or eighty miles from the sea, the hills grow higher, till they terminate in mountains.

The coast of Georgia is also defended from the rage of the sea by a range of islands. Those
islands are divided from the main by canals of salt water, navigable for the largest boats,
and even for small sloops. The lofty woods growing on each side of the canals, make very pleasant
landscapes. The land, at about seven or eight miles from the sea, is tolerably high; and the
further you go westward, the more it rises, till at about one hundred and fifty miles distance
from the sea, to the west, the Cherokee or Appallachean mountains begin, which are so high
that the snow lies upon them all the year.

This ridge of mountains runs in a line from north to south, on the back of the English colonies
of Carolina and Virginia; beginning at the great lakes of Canada, and extending south, it ends
in the province of Georgia at about two hundred miles from the bay of Appallachee, which is
part of the Gulf of Mexico. There is a plain country from the foot of these mountains to that sea.

The face of the country is mostly covered with woods. The banks of the rivers are in some places
low, and form a kind of natural meadows, where the floods prevent trees from growing. In other
places, in the hollows, between the hillocks, the brooks and streams, being stopt by falls
of trees, or other obstructions, the water is penned back. These places are often covered with
canes and thickets and are called, in the corrupted American dialect, swamps. The sides of
the hills are generally covered with oaks and hickory, or wild walnuts, cedar, sassafras, and
the famous laurel tulip, which is esteemed one of the most beautiful trees in the world. The
flat tops of the hillocks are all covered with groves of pine trees, with plenty of grass growing
under them, and so free from underwood that you may gallop a horse for forty or fifty miles
an end. In the low grounds and islands in the river there are cypress, bay-trees, poplar, plane,
frankincense or gum-trees, and aquatic shrubs. All part of the province are well watered; and,
in digging a moderate depth, you never miss of a fine spring.

What we call the Atlantic ocean, washes the east and southeast coast of these provinces. The
gulf stream of Florida sets in with a tide in the ocean to the east of the province; and it
is very remarkable that the banks and soundings of the coast extend twenty or twenty-five miles
to the east of the coast.

The tides upon this coast flow generally seven feet. The soundings are sand or ooze, and some
oyster banks, but no rocks. The coast appears low from the sea, and covered with woods.

Cape Fear is a point which runs with dreadful shoals far into the sea, from the mouth of Clarendon
river in North Carolina. Sullivan's Island and the Coffin land are the marks of the entry into
Charlestown harbor. Hilton head, upon French's island, shows the entry into Port Royal; and
the point of Tybee island makes the entry of the Savannah river. Upon that point the Trustees
for Georgia have erected a noble signal or light-house, ninety feet high, and twenty-five feet
wide. It is an octagon, and upon the top there is a flag-staff thirty feet high.

The Province of Georgia is watered by three great rivers, which rise in the mountains, namely,
the Alatamaha, the Ogechee, and the Savannah; the last of which is navigable six hundred miles
for canoes, and three hundred miles for boats.

The British dominions are divided from the Spanish Florida by a noble river called St. John's.

These rivers fall into the Atlantic ocean; but there are, besides these, the Flint and the
Cahooche, which pass through part of Carolina or Georgia, and fall into the gulf of Appellachee
or Mexico.

All Carolina is divided into three parts: 1. North Carolina, which is divided from South Carolina
by Clarendon river, and of late by a line marked out by order of the Council: 2. South Carolina,
which, on the south is divided from 3. Georgia by the river Savannah. Carolina is divided into
several counties; but in Georgia there is but one yet erected, namely, the county of Savannah.
It is bounded, on the one side, by the river Savannah, on the other by the sea, on the third
by the river Ogechee, on the fourth by the river Ebenezer, and a line drawn from the river
Ebenezer to the Ogechee. In this county are the rivers Vernon, Little Ogechee, and Westbrook.
There is the town of Savannah, where there is a seat of judicature, consisting of three bailiffs
and a recorder. It is situated upon the banks of the river of the same name. It consists of
about two hundred houses, and lies upon a plain of about a mile wide; the bank steep to the
river forty-five feet perpendicularly high. The streets are laid out regular. There are near
Savannah, in the same county, the villages of Hampstead, Highgate, Skidoway, and Thunderbolt;
the latter of which is a translation of a name; their fables say that a thunderbolt fell, and
a spring thereupon arose in that place, which still smells of the bolt. This spring is impregnated
with a mixture of sulphur and iron, and from the smell, probably, the story arose. In the same
county is Joseph's town and the town Ebenezer; both upon the river Savannah; and the villages
of Abercorn and Westbrook. There are saw mills erecting on the river Ebenezer; and the fort
Argyle, lies upon the pass of this county over the Ogechee. In the southern divisions of the
province lies the town of Frederica, with its district, where there is a court with three bailiffs
and a recorder. It lies on one side of the branches of the Alatamaha. There is, also, the town
of Darien, upon the same river, and several forts upon the proper passes, some of four bastions,
some are only redoubts. Besides which there are villages in different parts of Georgia. At
Savannah there is a public store house, built of large square timbers. There is also a handsome
court house, guard house, and work house. The church is not yet begun; but materials are collecting,
and it is designed to be a handsome edifice. The private houses are generally sawed timber,
framed, and covered with shingles. Many of them are painted, and most have chimneys of brick.
At Frederica some of the houses are built of brick; the others in the Province are mostly wood.
They are not got into luxury yet in their furniture; having only what is plain and needful.
The winter being mild, there are yet but few houses with glass windows.

The Indians are a manly, well-shaped race. The men tall, the women little. They, as the ancient
Grecians did, anoint with oil, and expose themselves to the sun, which occasions their skins
to be brown of color. The men paint themselves of various colors, red, blue, yellow, and black.
The men wear generally a girdle, with a piece of cloth drawn through their legs and turned
over the girdle both before and behind, so as to hide their nakedness. The women wear a kind
of petticoat to the knees. Both men and women in the winter wear mantles, something less than
two yards square, which they wrap round their bodies, as the Romans did their toga, generally
keeping their arms bare; they are sometimes of woolen, bought of the English; sometimes of
furs, which they dress themselves. They wear a kind of pumps, which they call moccasons, made
of deer-skin, which they dress for that purpose. They are a generous, good-natured people;
very humane to strangers; patient of want and pain; slow to anger, and not easily provoked,
but, when they are thoroughly incensed, they are implacable; very quick of apprehension and
gay of temper. Their public conferences show them to be men of genius, and they have a natural
eloquence, they never having had the use of letters. They love eating, and the English have
taught many of them to drink strong liquors, which, when they do, they are miserable sights.
They have no manufactures but what each family makes for its own use; they seem to despise
working for hire, and spend their time chiefly in hunting and war; but plant corn enough for
the support of their families and the strangers that come to visit them. Their food, instead
of bread, is flour of Indian corn boiled, and seasoned like hasty-pudding, and this called
hommony. They also boil venison, and make broth; they also roast, or rather broil their meat.
The flesh they feed on is buffalo, deer, wild turkeys and other game; so that hunting is necessary
to provide flesh; and planting for corn. The land[1] belongs to the women, and the corn that
grows upon it; but meat must be got by the men, because it is they only that hunt: this makes
marriage necessary, that the women may furnish corn, and the men meat. They have also fruit-trees
in their gardens, namely, peaches, nectarines, and locust, melons, and water-melons, potatoes,
pumpkins, onions, &c. in plenty; and many kinds of wild fruits, and nuts, as persimons, grapes,
chinquepins, and hickory nuts, of which they make oil. The bees make their combs in the hollow
trees, and the Indians find plenty of honey there, which they use instead of sugar. They make,
what supplies the place of salt, of wood ashes; use for seasoning, long-pepper, which grows
in their gardens; and bay-leaves supply their want of spice. Their exercises are a kind of
ball-playing, hunting, and running; and they are very fond of dancing. Their music is a kind
of drum, as also hollow cocoa-nut shells. They have a square in the middle of their towns,
in which the warriors sit, converse, and smoke together; but in rainy weather they meet in
the King's house. They are a very healthy people, and have hardly any diseases, except those
occasioned by the drinking of rum, and the small pox. Those who do not drink rum are exceedingly
long-lived. Old BRIM emperor of the Creeks, who died but a few years ago, lived to one hundred
and thirty years; and he was neither blind nor bed-rid, till some months before his death.
They have sometimes pleurisies and fevers, but no chronical distempers. They know of several
herbs that have great virtues in physic, particularly for the cure of venomous bites and wounds.

[Footnote 1: That is the homestead.]

The native animals are, first the urus or zoras described by Caesar, which the English very
ignorantly and erroneously call the buffalo. They have deer, of several kinds, and plenty of
roe-bucks and rabbits. There are bears and wolves, which are small and timorous; and a brown
wild-cat, without spots, which is very improperly called a tiger; otter, beavers, foxes, and
a species of badger which is called raccoon. There is great abundance of wild fowls, namely,
wild-turkey, partridges, doves of various kinds, wild-geese, ducks, teals, cranes, herons of
many kinds not known in Europe. There are great varieties of eagles and hawks, and great numbers
of small birds, particularly the rice-bird, which is very like the ortolan. There are rattlesnakes,
but not near so frequent as is generally reported. There are several species of snakes, some
of which are not venomous. There are crocodiles, porpoises, sturgeon, mullet, cat-fish, bass,
drum, devil-fish; and many species of fresh-water fish that we have not in Europe; and oysters
upon the sea-islands in great abundance.

What is most troublesome, there, are flies and gnats, which are very numerous near the rivers;
but, as the country is cleared, they disperse and go away.

The vegetables are innumerable; for all that grow in Europe, grow there; and many that cannot
stand in our winters thrive there.

of some of the distinguished friends of Oglethorpe.

APPENDIX

No. I

FAMILY OF OGLETHORPE.

The following genealogical memoranda are taken principally, from a note in Nichols's Literary
Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century, Vol. II. p. 17, on his having given the title of a book
ascribed to the subject of the foregoing memoir

"This truly respectable gentleman was the descendant of a family very anciently situated at
Oglethorpe, in the parish of Bramham, in the West Riding of the County of York; one of whom
was actually Reeve of the County (an office nearly the same with that of the present high-sheriff)
at the time of the Norman Conquest. The ancient seat of Oglethorpe continued in the family
till the Civil Wars, when it was lost for their loyalty; and several of the same name died
at once in the bed of honor in the defence of monarchy, in a battle near Oxford.

"William Oglethorpe, (son of William) was born in 1588. He married Susanna, daughter of Sir
William Sutton, Knight and sister to Lord Lexington. He died in November, 1634 leaving two
children, Sulton, born 1612, and Dorothy (who afterwards married the Marquis of Byron, a French
nobleman,) born 1620.

"Sutton Oglethorpe, being fined £20,000 by the Parliament, his estates at Oglethorpe, and elsewhere,
were sequestered, and afterwards given to General Fairfax, who sold them to Robert Benson of
Bramham, father of Lord Bingley of that name. Sutton Oglethorpe had two sons, Sutton, and Sir
Theophilus. Sutton was Stud-master to King Charles II.; and had three sons, namely, Sutton,
Page to King Charles II.; John, Cornet of the Guards; and Joseph, who died in India.

"Sir Theophilus was born in 1652; and was bred to arms. He fought, under the Duke of Monmouth,
in the affair at Bothwell bridge, where a tumultary insurrection of the Scots was suppressed,
June 22, 1679. He commanded a party of horse at Sedgmoor fight, where the Duke was defeated,
July 6, 1685; and was Lieutenant Colonel to the Duke of York's troop of his Majesty's horse-guards,
and Commissioner for executing the office of Master of the Horse to King Charles II. He was
afterwards first Equerry and Major General of the army of King James II.; and suffered banishment
with his Royal Master." After his return to his native country he purchased a seat in the County
of Surrey, called "the Westbrook place," near adjoining the town of Godalming; a beautiful
situation, in a fine country. It stands on the slope of a hill, at the foot of which are meadows
watered by the river Wey. It commands the view of several hills, running in different directions;
their sides laid out in corn fields, interspersed with hanging woods. Behind it is a small
park, well wooded; and one side is a capacious garden fronting the south-east.

Sir Theophilus was for several years a member of Parliament for Haslemere, a small borough
in the south-west angle of the county of Surrey. This place was, afterwards, in the reigns
of Anne, George I., and George II., successively represented by his three sons, Lewis, Theophilus,
and James. He died April 10,1702, as appears by a pedigree in the collection of the late J.C.
Brooke, Esq., though the following inscription in the parish church of St. James, Westminster,
where he was buried, has a year earlier.--"Hie jacet THEOPHILUS OGLETHORPE, Eques auratus,
ab atavo Vice-comite Eborum, Normanno victore, ducens originem. Cujus armis ad pontem Bothwelliensem,
succubuit Scotus: necnon Sedgmoriensi palude fusi Rebellos. Qui, per varies casus et rerum
discrimina, magnanimum erga Principem et Patriam fidem, sed non temerè, sustinuit. Obiit Londini
anno 1701, aetat. 50."

Sir Theophilus married Eleanora Wall, of a respectable family in Ireland, by whom he had four
sons and five daughters; namely, Lewis, Theophilus, Sutton, and James; Eleanora, Henrietta,
Mary, and Frances-Charlotte.

I. LEWIS, born February, 1680-1; admitted into Corpus Christi College, in the University of
Oxford, March 16,1698-9. He was Equerry to Queen Anne, and afterwards Aid-de-camp to the Duke
of Marlborough; and, in 1702, member of Parliament for Haslemere. Having been mortally wounded
in the battle of Schellenburgh, on the 24th October, 1704, he died on the 30th.

The following inscription to his memory is placed below that of Sir Theophilus.

"Hujus claudit latus LUDOVICUS OGLETHORPE, tam paternae virtutis, quam fortunae, haeres; qui,
proelio Schellenbergensi victoria Hockstatensis preludio tempestivum suis inclinantibus ferens
auxilium vulnere honestissima accepit, et praeclarae spe Indolis frustrata.--Ob. XXII aetatis,
Anno Dom. 1704.

"Charissimo utriusque marmor hoc, amantissima conjux et mater possuit, Domina Eleonora Oglethorpe."

II. THEOPHILUS, born 1682. He was Aid-de-camp to the Duke of Ormond; and member of Parliament
for Haslemere in 1708 and 1710. The time of his death is not recorded. He must have died young.

III. ELEONORA, born 1684; married the Marquis de Mezieres on the 5th of March, 1707-8, and
deceased June 28, 1775, aged 91. The son of this lady was heir to the estate of General Oglethorpe.
He is mentioned, in the correspondence of Mr. Jefferson, as highly meritorious and popular
in France, (1785.)

IV. ANN [mentioned in Shaftoe's narrative.]

V. SUTTON, born 1686; and died in November, 1693.

VI. HENRIETTA, [of whom we have no account.]

VII. JAMES, [see the next article.]

VIII. FRANCES-CHARLOTTE ... Married the Marquis de Bellegarde, a Savoyard.[1] To a son of this
union is a letter of General Washington, dated January 15, 1790, in the 9th volume of Sparks's
Writings of Washington, p. 70.

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. LVII. p. 1123.]

IX. MARY, who died single.

The ARMS of the family are thus described: "Argent, a chevron, between three boar's heads,
erased, sable armed, or, lingued proper."

CREST. "A boar's head, as before, holding an oaken branch, vert, fructed or."

DISCUSSION RESPECTING THE BIRTH-DAY OF OGLETHORPE.

There are great difficulties in ascertaining the age of Oglethorpe. The newspapers, soon after
his decease, in 1785. and the Gentleman's and London Magazine, contain several articles about it.

While these inquiries, investigations, and statements were going the round of all the periodicals
of the day, it is unaccountably strange that the family did not produce the desired rectification,
and yet more surprising that in the inscription on the monument erected to his memory by his
widow, and which was drawn up by her request, she should not have furnished the writer with
the date of his birth, and the years of age to which he had arrived.

The London Gazette, first announcing his death, stated it one hundred and four years. The Westminster
Magazine for July 1785, (a periodical published in the very neighborhood of the old family
mansion,) in the monthly notice of deaths, has "June 30th, General Oglethorpe, aged 102. He
was the oldest general in England." And I have a fine engraved portrait of him taken in February
preceding his decease, or which is inscribed "he died 30th of June, 1785, aged 102." A writer
in the Gentleman's Magazine for September, 1785 p. 701, who was one of the first emigrants
to Georgia, and personally and intimately acquainted with the General, declares that "he lived
to be near a hundred years old, but was not one hundred and two, as has been asserted."

In the Biographical Memoir of him in the 8th volume of the European Magazine; in NICHOLS's
Anecdotes of Literature and in McCALL's History of Georgia, his birth is said to have been
in 1698; and yet it is asserted by the best authorities, that he bore the military rank of
Ensign in 1710, when, according to their date of his nativity, he could have been but twelve
years of age; and this before his entering College at Oxford.

Again, some make him Captain Lieutenant in the first troop of the Queen's Guards in 1714; the
same year that others put him to College. According to such statements, he must on both these
military advancements, have been of an age quite too juvenile for military service, and more
so for military rank. And yet, to account for his obtaining such early, and, indeed, immature
promotion, the writers suggest that "he withdrew precipitately from the sphere of his education."
But I see no reason for supposing that he left the University before he had completed the usual
term of residence for obtaining a degree; though he did not obtain that of Master of Arts till
the 31st of July, 1731.[1]

[Footnote 1: See Catalogue of Oxford Graduates.]

PRIOR, in The Life of Goldsmith, page 457, expressly says that Oglethorpe, "after being educated
at Oxford, served under Prince Eugene against the Turks."[1]

[Footnote 1: About this time he presented a manuscript French paraphrase of the Bible, in two
folio volumes, finely illuminated, to the library of Corpus Christi College in Oxford. "The
gift of James Oglethorpe, Esq., Member of Parliament." GUTCH's Appendix to Wood's History and
Antiquities of the Colleges and Halls in the University of Oxford.]

Again, CROKER has a long note upon a passage in Boswell's Life of Johnson, II. p. 173, to invalidate
a narative of Oglethorpe's respecting a writing of Colonel Sir Thomas Prendergast, who was
killed at the battle of Malplaquet, on the 31st of August, 1709, which thus concludes: "At
the battle of Malplaquet, Oglethorpe was only eleven years old. Is it likely that Oglethorpe,
at the age of eleven years, was present at Pope's interview with Colonel Cecil? And, even if
he were, what credit is to be given to the recollections, after the lapse of sixty-three years,
of what a boy of eleven heard?"[1]

[Footnote 1: CROKER means that the time when Oglethorpe told the story to Dr. Johnson was sixty-three
years after the battle of Malplaquet, when the event referred to took place.]

In reply to this, I would observe, that it is not even probable, as this statement would imply,
that the interview of Pope with Colonel Cecil was directly after the battle. There might have
been intervening years. Moreover, Croker goes upon the presumption that the birth of Oglethorpe
was in 1698. Now, to assign his birth to that year would make him only eighty-seven years old
when he died; but Dr. Lettsom, in "a letter on prisons," in the Gentleman's Magazine, Vol.
LXXI. p. 21, has this remark: "I spent an evening, which agreeably continued till two o'clock
in the morning, with the late General Oglethorpe, when this veteran was in the ninety-sixth
year of his age; who told me, that he planted Georgia chiefly from prisons." And Hannah More
writes of being in company with him when he was much above ninety years of age. He was, therefore,
born before 1698. And, finally, the record of his admission into Corpus Christi College, at
Oxford, decides the matter beyond all controversy; and, by certifying his age to be sixteen,
proves that he was born in sixteen hundred and eighty-eight. For the month and day, I receive
the testimony of William Stephens, Esq., Secretary for the affairs of the Trustees in Georgia,
in the first volume of his Journal. On Thursday, December, 21st, [1738,] he makes this record.

"Another heavy rain of all last night, and this whole day's continuance; which, whatever impediments
it might occasion to our other affairs, was no hindrance to our celebration of the General's
birth-day, as had been always the custom hitherto; and in the very same manner as we did last
year, under the discharge of cannon, &c." And McCall, who has named December 21st, says, "I
am indebted to the Encyclopedia Perthensis, and to the Journal of a private gentleman in Georgia,
where his birth-day was celebrated, for the date which I have inserted."[1]

[Footnote 1: History of Georgia, Vol. I. p. 321.]

This assignment will tally with the other dates and their attendant circumstances; allow time,
with becoming propriety, for finishing his education at the University; and show that he was
not so precocious a soldier as has been represented, but that, instead of the juvenile age
of eleven, he entered the army at the manly age of twenty-one.

Memorandum. This attempt to ascertain the exact age of Oglethorpe, was written in 1837. I have,
since then, received the following letter, dated London, October 2d, 1840.

  My Dear Sir.
    In compliance with your request, I. have been, this morning,
  to the vestry of St. James, Westminster, where I examined
  the record of Oglethorpe's baptism, of which the following is
  an exact copy in substance and form.

  Bapt. |            June 1689
   2.   |   James Oglethorpe of Sir Theophilus and
        |           his lady Elinor, b. 1.

    I certify that the above is a true extract from the Register
  Book of Baptisms belonging to the Parish of St. James,
  Westminster.
                   J.G. GIFFORD, Preacher and Assistant.

    Hence it appears that Oglethorpe was born on the first of
  June, 1669, and baptized on the second. I was assured by
  Mr. Gifford that this is the true meaning of the record; and
  I observed in the Register Book that other names were recorded
  in like manner. There were several other baptisms the
  same day, with different days of birth.
             Most truly your friend and obedient servant,
                                           JARED SPARKS.

This will be deemed decisive; though to me not entirely satisfactory. I think I see cause for
questioning the "b.1." not their import, but their correctness: occasioned either for family
reasons, or that the date given at the font either was not distinctly heard by the officiating
clergyman, or misremembered at the time when the entry was made in the Book. Besides, there
would seem no occasion for the presentation so immediately after the birth; for, according
to custom, it is very unusual before the eighth day. On the other hand, from the statement
of Nichols, Vol. II. p. 19, that of the children of Sir Theophilus, "the five eldest were born
at St. James London," we may infer that JAMES, who was the sixth in the order of births in
the family, was born at Godalming. This is proved, also, by Shaftoe's narrative, which mentions
the going down of the mother to London, in consequence of the sickness and death of one of
the nurslings. Now, though the main statement of that document may not be true, such an incidental
circumstance as this, which has no direct bearing on "the vexed question," may be admitted.
If, therefore, born at Godalming, he could not be taken to London, for baptism, on the day
after his birth. And, admitting that his nativity was on the 21st of December, the season of
the year alone would be sufficient reason for deferring the public ceremony till after the
inclement weather, and the opportunity favored for having it in the Parish Church, where all
the other children had been baptized.

After all, the fact that on the ninth of July, seventeen hundred and four, he was sixteen years
old, as is testified on the Record of his admission into College, is incompatible with the
date of June 1st, 1689, for the day of his birth, but consistent with that of December 21st, 1688.

To adjust all these discrepancies respecting the time of his birth, and others of the time
of his death, one needs the ingenuity of the Benedictins of St. Maur, who published a 4to volume
with this title: "L'art de verifier les dates des faits historiques."

III.

CHARLES MORDAUNT, Earl of Peterborough. This great man died on his passage to Lisbon, 25th
of October, 1735, aged 77. To bravery and heroism, he added a penetrating genius and a mind
highly polished and well instructed in ancient and modern literature, as his Familiar Epistles,
preserved among those of his friend Pope, fully evince.

Of REV. GEORGE BERKELEY, D.D., the celebrated Dean of Derry, and afterwards Bishop of Cloyne,
I give the following particulars.

His learning and virtues, his lively and agreeable conversation, introduced him to the acquaintance,
and procured him the esteem and friendship of many great and learned men, and among others
the Earl of Peterborough, who made him his Chaplain, and took him as a companion on a tour
of Europe in 1714-15. Soon after his return, the Dean published a proposal for the better supplying
of the churches in the American Plantations with Clergymen, and for instructing and converting
the savages to Christianity, by erecting a College in Bermuda. The first branch of this design
appeared to him in the light of importance; but his principal view was to train up a competent
number of young Indians, in succession, to be employed as missionaries among the various tribes
of Indians. It appeared to be a matter of very material consequence, that persons should be
employed in this service who were acquainted with the language necessary to be used; and he
had also a strong persuasion that such missionaries as he proposed would be much better received
by the savages than those of European extraction. These Indian lads were to be obtained from
the different tribes in the fairest manner, and to be fed, clothed and instructed at the expense
of the Institution.

The scheme, for some time, met with all the encouragement that was due to so benevolent a proposal.
The King granted a charter; and the Parliament voted a very considerable sum to be obtained
from the sale of lands in St. Christophers. Such a prospect of success in the favorite object
of his heart, drew from Berkeley some beautiful verses, "in which," a writer of the day remarks,
"another age, perhaps, will acknowledge the old conjunction of the prophetic character with
that of the poetic, to have again taken place."

In consequence of this encouragement, he resigned his rich Deanry; and in execution of his
noble design, embarked in the latter part of Autumn, 1728; his lady and her sister accompanying
him; and arrived at Newport, in Rhode Island, in February following. This situation he pitched
upon with a view of settling a correspondence there for supplying his College. He purchased
a country-seat and farm in the neighborhood, where he resided about two years and a half. His
residence in this country had some influence on the progress of literature, particularly in
Rhode Island and Connecticut. The presence and conversation of a man so illustrious for talents,
learning, virtue, and social attractions, could not fail of giving a spring to the literary
diligence and ambition of many who enjoyed his acquaintance.

Finding, at length, that the promised aid of the ministry towards his College would fail him,
he embarked at Boston in September 1731, on his return to England. At his departure he distributed
the books which he had brought with him, among the Clergy of Rhode Island. He sent, as a gift
to Yale College, a deed of his farm; and afterwards made a present to its Library of about
a thousand volumes.

Immediately after his arrival in London, he returned all the private subscriptions that had
been advanced for the support of his undertaking.

The fund, which had been calculated upon for his College, had been chiefly appropriated as
a marriage portion of the Princess Ann, on her nuptials with the Prince of Orange. There remained,
however, £10,000, which General Oglethorpe had interest enough in Parliament to obtain for
the purpose of carrying over and settling foreign and other Protestants in his new Colony of
Georgia in America;[1] "having first paid Dean Berkeley the compliment of asking his consent
to the application for the money, before he moved for it in Parliament."

[Footnote 1: See Journal of the House of Commons, May 10, 1733.]

He passed the latter part of his life at Oxford; and deceased January 14th, 1753, aged 74.

The character of this worthy prelate was expressed in few words by Bishop Atterbury, who, having
heard much of him, wished to see him. Accordingly, he was one day introduced to him by the
Earl of Berkeley. After some time, Mr. Berkeley quitted the room; on which the Earl said to
the Bishop, "Does my cousin answer your Lordship's expectations?"

Mr. Pope sums up Bishop Berkeley's character in one line. After mentioning some particular
virtues that distinguished other Prelates, he ascribes

  "To Berkeley every virtue under heaven."

I close these memoirs of the early companion, and congenial and lasting friend of Oglethorpe,
with the verses referred to, written by him.

"ON THE PROSPECT OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IN AMERICA."

  The muse, disgusted at an age and time,
    Barren of every glorious theme,
  In distant lands now waits a better clime,
    Producing subjects worthy fame.

  Not such as Europe breeds in her decay,
    Such as she bred when fresh and young,
  When heavenly flame did animate her clay,
    By future ages shall be sung.

PRISON-VISITING COMMITTEE.

This committee consisted of the following gentlemen:

  James Oglethorpe, Esquire, Chairman,
  The Right Honorable the Lord Finch,
  The Right Honorable Lord Percival,
  Sir Robert Sutton, Knight of the Bath,
  Sir Robert Clifton, Knight of the Bath,
  Sir Abraham Elton, Baronet,
  Sir Gregory Page, Baronet,
  Sir Edmund Knatchbull, Baronet,
  Vultus Cornwall, Esquire,
  General Wade,
  Humphry Parsons, Esquire,
  Captain Vernon,
  Robert Byng, Esquire,
  Judge Advocate Hughes.

On Thursday, the 27th of February, they went to the Fleet prison to examine into the state
of that gaol, in order for the relief of the insolvent debtors, &c., when the irons were ordered
to be taken off Sir William Rich, Baronet. The next day, the same committee went a second time
to the Fleet prison, where, upon complaint made to them that Sir William Rich was again put
in irons, they made report thereof to the House of Commons, who thereupon ordered Mr. Bambridge,
the warden of the Fleet, to be taken into the custody of their sergeant at arms.

"At the same time, upon a motion made by Mr. Oglethorpe, by direction of the committee, it
was unanimously resolved to address his Majesty that he would be graciously pleased to direct
his Attorney General forthwith to prosecute, in the most effectual manner, the said Thomas
Bambridge, John Higgins, James Barnes, William Pindar, John Everett, and Thomas King for their
said crimes.

"It was also ordered that the said Bambridge, Higgins, Barnes, Pindar, Everett, and King be
committed close prisoners in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate.

"Then, upon Mr. Oglethorpe's motions, two bills were ordered to be brought in, one to disable
Thomas Bambridge from holding or executing the office of Warden of the Prison of the Fleet,
or to have or exercise any authority relating therein.

"In the last place the Commons ordered the Report from the Committee relating to the Fleet
prison to be printed." [N.B. The substance of this report is given in BOYER's Political State
of Europe, Vol. XXXVII. p. 359-377.]

The labors of Oglethorpe and his associates to correct prison abuses, were warmly acknowledged
by their country, and were the grateful theme of the poet. They were alluded to by THOMSON
in the following strain:

  "And here can I forget the generous hand
  Who, touched with human woe, redressive searched
  Into the horrors of the gloomy jail?
  Where misery moans unpitied and unheard,
  Where sickness pines, where thirst and hunger burn,
  And poor misfortune feels the lash of vice?

         *       *       *       *       *

  "Ye sons of mercy! yet resume the search,
  Drag forth the legal monsters into light;
  Wrench from their hands oppression's iron rod
  And bid the cruel feel the pains they give!"

  [Winter, l. 359-388.]

"The wretched condition of confined debtors, and the extortions and oppressions to which they
were subjected by gaolers, thus came to be known to persons in high stations, and this excited
the compassion of several gentlemen to think of some method of relieving the poor from that
distress in which they were often involved without any fault of their own, but by some conduct
which deserved pity rather than punishment."

VI.

RELEASE TO INSOLVENT DEBTORS, FROM PRISON.

In a very excellent publication entitled "Reasons for establishing the Colony of GEORGIA, with
regard to the trade of Great Britain, the increase of our people, and the employment and support
it will afford to great numbers of our own poor, as well as foreign Protestants," by BENJAMIN
MARTIN, Esq. Lond. 1733; are some remarks in reference to the release of insolvent debtors
from gaol, which I deem it proper to extract and annex here; and the rather, because the work
is exceedingly rare.

After describing the deplorable condition of those who are in reduced circumstances, and need
assistance and would be glad of employment, the writer refers to the situation of those who
are thrown into prison for debt, and judges that the number may be estimated at four thousand
every year; and that above one third part of the debts is never recovered hereby; and then
adds, "If half of these, or only five hundred of them, were to be sent to Georgia every year
to be incorporated with those foreign Protestants who are expelled their own country for religion,
what great improvements might not be expected in our trade, when those, as well as the foreigners,
would be so many new subjects gained by England? For, while they are in prison, they are absolutely
lost,--the public loses their labor, and their knowledge. If they take the benefit of the Act
of Parliament that allows them liberty on the delivery of their all to their creditors, they
come destitute into the world again. As they have no money and little credit, they find it
almost impossible to, get into business, especially when our trades are overstocked. They,
therefore, by contracting new debts, must return again into prison, or, how honest soever their
dispositions may be, by idleness and necessity will be forced into bad courses, such as begging,
cheating, or robbing. These, then, likewise, are useless to the state; not only so, but dangerous.
But these (it will be said) may be serviceable by their labor in the country. To force them
to it, I am afraid, is impracticable; to suppose they will voluntarily do it, I am sure is
unlikely. The Colony of Georgia will be a proper asylum for these. This will make the act of
parliament of more effect. Here they will have the best motive for industry; a possession of
their own, and no possibility of subsisting without it.

"I have heard it said that our prisons are the properest places for those that are thrown into
them, by keeping them from being hurtful to others. Surely this way of thinking is something
too severe. Are these people, with their liberty to lose our compassion? Are they to be shut
up from our eyes, and excluded also from our hearts? Many of very honest dispositions fall
into decay, nay, perhaps, because they are so, because they cannot allow themselves that latitude
which others take to be successful. The ways that lead to a man's ruin are various. Some are
undone by overtrading, others by want of trade; many by being responsible for others. Do all
these deserve such hardship? If a man sees a friend, a brother, a father going to a prison,
where felons are to be his society, want and sickness his sure attendants, and death, in all
likelihood his only, but quick relief; if he stretches out his hand to save him from immediate
slavery and ruin, he runs the risk of his own liberty, and at last loses it; is there any one
who will say, this man is not an object of compassion? Not so, but of esteem, and worth preserving
for his virtue. But supposing that idleness and intemperance are the usual cause of his ruin.
Are these crimes adequate to such a punishment as confinement for life? But even yet granting
that these unhappy people deserve no indulgence, it is certainly imprudent in any state to
lose the benefit of the labor of so many thousands.

"But the public loss, by throwing men into prison, is not confined to them only. They have
many of them wives and children. These are, also, involved in their ruin. Being destitute of
a support, they must perish, or else become a burden on their parishes by an inability to work,
or a nuisance by their thefts. These, too, are useless to society.

"In short, all those who can work yet are supported in idleness by any mistaken charity, or
are subsisted by their parishes, which are at this time, through all England overburdened by
indolent and lazy poor, who claim and are designed only for impotent poor;--all those who add
nothing by their labor to the welfare of the state, are useless, burdensome, or dangerous to
it. What is to be done with these necessitous? Nobody, I suppose, thinks that they should continue
useless. It will be then an act of charity to these, and of merit to the public, for any one
to propose, forward, and perfect a better expedient for making them useful. If he cannot, it
is surely just to acquiesce, till a better be found, in the present design of settling them
in Georgia." p. 16-21.

VII.

SIR THOMAS LOMBE'S MILL FOR WINDING SILK

"In 1719, a silk-throwing mill was erected at Derby, and from that time to the beginning of
the present century, various improvements were introduced.

"The following account of the first silk mill erected in England will be interesting. At the
commencement of the last century, a person of the name of Crochet erected a small mill near
the present works, with the intention of introducing the Italian method of spinning into this
country. About 1715, a similar plan was in the contemplation of a mechanic and draughtsman
named John Lombe, who travelled into Italy to procure drawings and models of the machines necessary
for the undertaking. After remaining some time in that country, and gaining as much information
as the jealousy and precautions of the merchants of Italy would allow, he returned with two
natives, accustomed to the manufacture, into this country, and fixed upon Derby as a proper
place to establish his works. He agreed with the corporation for an island, or rather swamp,
in the river, 500 feet long and 52 feet wide, at the rent of about £8 yearly. Here he established
his silk mills, and in 1718 procured a patent to enable him to secure the profits for fourteen
years. But Lombe did not live much longer; for the Italians, exasperated at the injury done
to their trade by its introduction into England, sent an artful woman over, who associated
with the parties in the character of a friend, and, having gained over one of the natives who
had originally accompanied Mr. Lombe, administered a poison to him, of which, it is said, he
ultimately died. His death, however, did not prove fatal to his scheme; for his brother, and
afterwards his cousin, carried on the business with energy, and employed more than three hundred
persons. A little before the expiration of the Patent, Sir Thomas Lombe petitioned for a renewal
of it; but this was refused, and instead of it, £14,000 was granted him, on condition that
he should allow a complete model of the works to be taken; this was accordingly done, and afterwards
deposited in the town for public inspection.

"This extensive mill stands upon a huge pile of oak, double planked and covered with stone-work,
on which are turned thirteen stone arches, which sustain the walls.

"The spinning mills are eight in number, and give motion to upwards of 25,000 reel bobbins,
and nearly 3000 star wheels belonging to the reels. Each of the four twist mills contains four
rounds of spindles, about 389 of which are connected with each mill, as well as the numerous
reels, bobbins, star wheels, &c. The whole of this elaborate machine, though distributed through
so many apartments, is put in motion by a single water-wheel twenty-three feet in diameter,
situated on the west side of the building."

[Treatise on the Manufactures and Machinery of Great Britain, by P. BARLOW, Esq., F.R.S., &c.,
in the Encyclopedia Metropol. Part VI. "Mixed Sciences."]

"Sir Thomas Lombe, Alderman of Bassishaw Ward, died, at his house in Old Jury, London, on the
third of January 1739, aged 81. A gentleman of great integrity and honor. He was the senior
Alderman, next the chair. Worth £120,000 sterling."

VIII.

CASE OF CAPTAIN PORTEOUS.

There is an account of the riot, and of all the particulars attending the murder of Captain
Porteous, at the close of the 9th volume of the History of the Proceedings of the House of
Commons, from page 506 to 545; and a concise narrative in the History of England, by Lord MAHON,
Vol. II. p. 285-298. He introduces it by the following remarks: "Some years back, the real
events might have excited interest; but the wand of an enchanter is now waved over us. We feel
the spell of the greatest writer that the world has seen in one department, or Scotland produced
in any. How dull and lifeless will not the true facts appear when no longer embellished by
the touching sorrows of Effie, or the heroic virtue of Jeanie Deans!" He refers, in a note,
to chapter VI. of The Heart of Mid Lothian, by Sir WALTER SCOTT, and to "his excellent narrative"
in the 2d series of the Tales of a Grandfather, from p. 231 to 242, the end of the volume.
See also the able speech of Mr. LINDSAY, in the Parliamentary History, p. 254.

It is worthy of remark that the Bill was carried in Committee by the least possible majority.
One hundred and thirty-one members voted for reporting the Bill as amended; the same number
voted against it. And, though it is customary for the Chairman to give his vote on the side
of mercy, he voted in favor of the Bill. It is further remarkable, that two Scots members,
the Solicitor General, and Mr. Erskine of Grange, were then attending an appeal in the House
of Lords, and were refused leave of absence in order to be at this discussion, otherwise the
Bill would have been entirely lost.

IX.

About the end of the month of August, 1732, Sir Gilbert Heathcote acquainted the court of directors
of the Bank of England, that his Majesty had granted a charter for establishing a regular colony
in Georgia; that the fund was to arise from charitable contributions which he recommended to
them, shewing the great charity of the undertaking and the future benefit arising to England,
by strengthening all the American Colonies, by increasing the trade and navigation of the kingdom,
and by raising of raw silk, for which upwards of £500,000 a year was paid to Piedmont, and
thereby giving employment to thousands of tradesmen and working people. Then Sir Gilbert gave
a handsome benefaction to the design, and his example was followed by the directors then present,
and a great many others belonging to that opulent society; and James Vernon, Robert Hucks,
and George Heathcote, Esquires, paid into the Bank (the treasury for this use) £200 each for
the charity, which was conducted by the following gentlemen as trustees:

  Anthony Earl of Shaftesbury,         Francis Eyles, Esq.
  John Lord Viscount Purceval,         John Laroche, Esq.
  John Lord Viscount Tyrconnel,        James Vernon, Esq.
  James Lord Viscount Limerick,        Stephen Hales, A.M.
  George Lord Carpenter,               Richard Chandler, Esq.
  Edward Digby, Esq.                   Thomas Frederick, Esq.
  James Oglethorpe, Esq.               Henry L'Apostre, Esq.
  George Heathcote, Esq.               William Heathcote, Esq.
  Thomas Towers, Esq.                  John White, Esq.
  Robert Moore, Esq.                   Robert Kendal, Esq.
  Robert Hucks, Esq.                   Richard Bundy, D.D.
  William Sloper, Esq.

Collections were made all over England, and large sums raised, and the Parliament gave £10,000,
which enabled the trustees to entertain many poor people that offered, and to make provision
for their transportation and maintenance till they could provide for themselves.

[OLDMIXON, I. p.526.

  "Those who direct this charity have, by their own choice,
  in the most open and disinterested manner, made it impossible
  for any one among them to receive any advantage from
  it, besides the consciousness of making others happy. Voluntary
  and unpaid directors carry on their designs with honor
  and success. Such an association of men of leisure and fortune
  to do good, is the glory and praise of our country."]

OGLETHORPE'S DISINTERESTEDNESS IN THE UNDERTAKING.

As Oglethorpe's going along with this new Colony proceeded merely from his public spirit, and
from a disinterested and generous view of contributing all that was in his power, towards the
benefit of his country, and the relief of his distressed countrymen, it met with just and deserved
applause. In one of the public prints of the day the following encomium was inserted.

"Whether it is owing to an affectation of being thought conversant with the ancients, or the
narrowness of our minds, I know not, but we often pass over those actions in our contemporaries
which would strike us with admiration in a Greek or a Roman. Their histories perhaps cannot
produce a greater instance of public spirit than what appeared in an evening paper of Saturday,
the 18th instant, that 'James Oglethorpe, Esq., one of the Trustees for establishing the Colony
of Georgia, is gone over with the first embarkation at his own expense.' To see a gentleman
of his rank and fortune visiting a distant and uncultivated land, with no other society but
the miserable whom he goes to assist; exposing himself freely to the same hardships to which
they are subjected, in the prime of life, instead of pursuing his pleasures or ambition; on
an improved and well concerted plan, from which his country must reap the profits; at his own
expense, and without a view, or even a possibility of receiving any private advantage from
it; this too, after having done and expended for it what many generous men would think sufficient
to have done;--to see this, I say, must give every one who has approved and contributed to
the undertaking, the highest satisfaction; must convince the world of the disinterested zeal
with which the settlement is to be made, and entitle him to the truest honor he can gain, the
perpetual love and applause of mankind.

"With how just an esteem do we look back on Sir Walter Raleigh for the expeditions which he
made so beneficial to his country! And shall we refuse the same justice to the living which
we pay to the dead, when by it we can raise a proper emulation in men of capacity, and divert
them from those idle or selfish pursuits in which they are too generally engaged? How amiable
is humanity when accompanied with so much industry! What an honor is such a man! How happy
must he be! The benevolent man, says Epicurus, is like a river, which, if it had a rational
soul, must have the highest delight to see so many corn fields and pastures flourish and smile,
as it were, with plenty and verdure, and all by the overflowing of its bounty and diffusion
of its streams upon them.

"I should not have written so much of this Gentleman, had he been present to read it. I hope
to see every man as warm in praising him as I am, and as hearty to encourage the design he
is promoting as I really think it deserves; a design that sets charity on a right foot, by
relieving the indigent and unfortunate, and making them useful at the same time."[1]

XLV. p.181.]

On the 13th of January, 1732-3, the Governor of South Carolina published in their Gazette the
following advertisement.

Whereas I have lately received a power from the Trustees for establishing a Colony in that
part of Carolina between the rivers Alatamaha and Savannah, now granted by his Majesty's Charter
to the said Trustees, by the name of the Province of Georgia, authorizing me to take and receive
all such voluntary contributions as any of his Majesty's good subjects of this Province shall
voluntarily contribute towards so good and charitable a work, as the relieving poor and insolvent
debtors, and settling, establishing, and assisting any poor Protestants of what nation soever,
as shall be willing to settle in the said Colony; and whereas the said intended settlement
will, in all human appearance, be a great strengthening and security to this Province, as well
as a charitable and pious work, and worthy to be encouraged and promoted by all pious and good
Christians; I have, therefore, thought fit to publish and make known to all such pious and
well disposed persons as are willing to promote so good a work, that I have ordered and directed
Mr. Jesse Badenhop to receive all such subscriptions or sums of money as shall be by them subscribed
or paid in for the uses and purposes aforesaid; which sums of money (be they great or small,)
I promise them shall be faithfully remitted to the Trustees by the aforesaid charter appointed,
together with the names of the subscribers, which will by them be published every year; or,
(if they desire their names to be kept secret) the names of the persons by whom they make the
said subscriptions.

The piety and charity of so good an undertaking, I hope will be a sufficient inducement to
every person to contribute something to a work so acceptable to God, as well as so advantageous
to this Province.

R. JOHNSON.

A Copy of the Letter of the Governor and Council of South Carolina, to Mr. Oglethorpe.

Sir--We cannot omit the first opportunity of congratulating you on your safe arrival in this
province, wishing you all imaginable success in your charitable and generous undertaking; in
which we beg leave to assure you that any assistance we can give shall not be wanting in the
promotion of the same.

The General Assembly having come to the Resolutions inclosed, we hope you will accept it as
an instance of our sincere intentions to forward so good a work; and of our attachment to a
person who has at all times so generously used his endeavors to relieve the poor, and deliver
them out of their distress; in which you have hitherto been so successful, that we are persuaded
this undertaking cannot fail under your prudent conduct, which we most heartily wish for.

The rangers and scout-boats are ordered to attend you as soon as possible.

Colonel Bull, a gentleman of this Board, and who we esteem most capable to assist you in the
settling of your new Colony, is desired to deliver you this, and to accompany you, and render
you the best services he is capable of; and is one whose integrity you may very much depend on.

We are, with the greatest respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servants.

Council Chamber, 26 January, 1733.

Copy of the Assembly's Resolutions.

The Committee of his Majesty's Honorable Council appointed to confer with a Committee of the
lower House on his Excellency's message relating to the arrival of the Honorable James Oglethorpe,
Esq., report--

That agreeable to his Majesty's instructions to his Excellency, sent down together with the
said message, we are unanimously of opinion that all due countenance and encouragement ought
to be given to the settling of the Colony of Georgia.

And for that end your Committee apprehend it necessary that his Excellency be desired to give
orders and directions that Captain McPherson, together with fifteen of the rangers, do forthwith
repair to the new settlement of Georgia, to cover and protect Mr. Oglethorpe, and those under
his care, from any insult that may be offered them by the Indians, and that they continue and
abide there till the new settlers have enforted themselves, and for such further time as his
Excellency may think necessary.

That the Lieutenant and four men of the Apalachicola Garrison be ordered to march to the fort
on Cambahee, to join those of the rangers that remain; and that the Commissary be ordered to
find them with provision as usual.

That his Excellency will please to give directions that the scout-boat at Port Royal do attend
the new settlers as often as his Excellency shall see occasion.

That a present be given Mr. Oglethorpe for the new settlers of Georgia forthwith, of an hundred
head of breeding cattle and five bulls, as also twenty breeding sows and four boars, with twenty
barrels of good and merchantable rice; the whole to be delivered at the charge of the public,
at such place in Georgia as Mr. Oglethorpe shall appoint.

That periauguas be provided at the charge of the public to attend Mr. Oglethorpe at Port Royal,
in order to carry the new settlers, arrived in the ship Anne, to Georgia, with their effects,
and the artillery and ammunition now on board.

That Colonel Bull be desired to go to Georgia with the Honorable James Oglethorpe, Esq., to
aid him with his best advice and assistance in settling the place.

Extract of a Letter from His Excellency Robert Johnson, Esq., Governor of South Carolina, to
Benjamin Martyn, Esq., Secretary to the Trustees, &c.

CHARLESTOWN, Feb. 12, 1733.

Sir--I have received the favor of yours, dated the 20th of October, and the duplicate of the
24th. I beg you will assure the Honorable Trustees of my humble respects, and that I will attach
myself to render them and their laudable undertaking all the service in my power.

Mr. Oglethorpe arrived here with his people in good health the 13th of January. I ordered him
a pilot, and in ten hours he proceeded to Port Royal, where he arrived safe the 19th, and I
understand from thence, that, after refreshing his people a little in our barracks, he, with
all expedition, proceeded to Yamacraw, upon Savannah River, about twelve miles from the sea,
where he designs to fix those he has brought with him.

I do assure you, that upon the first news I had of this embarkation, I was not wanting in giving
the necessary orders for their reception; and, being assisted at Port Royal, (although they
were here almost as soon as we heard of their design of coming,) not knowing whether Mr. Oglethorpe
designed directly there, or would touch here.

I am informed he is mighty well satisfied with his reception there, and likes the country;
and that he says things succeed beyond his expectation; but I have not yet received a letter
from him since his being at Port Royal.

Our General Assembly meeting three days after his departure, I moved to them their assisting
this generous undertaking. Both Houses immediately came to the following resolution; that Mr.
Oglethorpe should be furnished at the public expense, with one hundred and four breeding cattle,
twenty-five hogs, and twenty barrels of good rice; that boats should also be provided at the
public charge to transport the people, provisions and goods, from Port Royal to the place where
he designed to settle; that the scout-boats, and fifteen of our rangers, (who are horsemen,
and always kept in pay to discover the motions of the Indians,) should attend to Mr. Oglethorpe,
and obey his commands, in order to protect the new settlers from any insults, which I think
there is no danger of; and I have given the necessary advice and instructions to our out garrisons,
and the Indians in friendship with us, that they may befriend and assist them.

I have likewise prevailed on Colonel Bull, a member of the Council, and a gentleman of great
probity and experience in the affairs of this Province, the nature of land, and the method
of settling, and who is well acquainted with the manner of the Indians, to attend Mr. Oglethorpe
to Georgia with our compliments, and to offer him advice and assistance; and, had not our Assembly
been sitting, I would have gone myself.

I received the Trustees commission; for the honor of which I beg you will thank them. I heartily
wish all imaginable success to this good work; and am, Sir,

Your most humble Servant,

ROBERT JOHNSON.

P.S. Since writing the above, I have had the pleasure of hearing from Mr. Oglethorpe, who gives
me an account that his undertaking goes on very successfully.

Creeks, so called by the English, because their country lies chiefly among rivers, which the
American English call "creeks;" but the real name is Musogees. Their language is the softest
and most copious of all the Indians, and is looked upon to be the radical language; for they
can make themselves understood by almost all the other Indians on the Continent. They are divided
into three people, Upper, Lower, and Middle Creeks. The two former governed by their respective
chiefs, whom they honor with a royal denomination; yet they are, in the most material part
of their government, subordinate to the Chief of the latter, who bears an imperial title. Their
country lies between Spanish Florida and the Cherokee mountains, and from the Atlantic Ocean
to the Gulf of Mexico. They are a tall, well-limbed people, very brave in war, and as much
respected in the South, as the Iroquois are in the North part of America. ADAIR, 257. BARTON's

XIII.

ACCOUNT OF THE INDIANS IN GEORGIA, BEING PART OF A LETTER FROM OGLETHORPE, DATED 9TH JUNE, 1733.

There seems to be a door opened to our Colony towards the conversion of the Indians. I have
had many conversations with their chief men, the whole tenor of which shews that there is nothing
wanting to their conversion but one who understands their language well, to explain to them
the mysteries of religion; for, as to the moral part of Christianity, they understand it, and
do assent to it. They abhor adultery, and do not approve of a plurality of wives. Theft is
a thing not known among the Creek Indians; though frequent, and even honorable among the Uchees.
Murder they look on as a most abominable crime: but do not esteem the killing of an enemy,
or one that has injured them, murder. The passion of revenge, which they call honor, and drunkenness,
which they learn from our traders, seem to be the two greatest obstacles to their being truly
Christians: but, upon both these points they hear reason; and with respect to drinking rum,
I have weaned those near me a good deal from it. As for revenge, they say, as they have no
executive power of justice amongst them, they are forced to kill the man who has injured them,
in order to prevent others doing the like; but they do not think any injury, except adultery,
or murder, deserves revenge. They hold that if a man commits adultery, the injured husband
is obliged to have revenge, by cutting off the ears of the adulterer, which, if he is too strong
or sturdy to submit to, then the injured husband kills him the first opportunity he has to
do it with safety. In cases of murder, the next in blood is obliged to kill the murderer, or
else he is looked on as infamous in the nation where he lives; and the weakness of the executive
power is such, that there is no other way of punishment but by the revenger of blood, as the
Scripture calls it; for there is no coercive power in any of their nations; their kings can
do no more than to persuade. All the power they have is no more than to call their old men
and captains together, and to propound to them the measures they think proper; and, after they
have done speaking, all the others have liberty to give their opinions also; and they reason
together with great temper and modesty, till they have brought each other into some unanimous
resolution. Then they call in the young men, and recommend to them the putting in execution
the resolution, with their strongest and most lively eloquence. And, indeed, they seem to me,
both in action and expression, to be thorough masters of true eloquence. In speaking to their
young men, they generally address the passions. In speaking to the old men, they apply to reason
only. [He then states the interview with the Creeks, and gives the first set speech of Tomo
Chichi, which has been quoted.] One of the Indians of the Cherokee nation, being come down,
the Governor told him that "he need fear nothing, but might speak freely," answered smartly,
"I always speak freely, what should I fear? I am now among friends, and I never feared even
among my enemies." Another instance of their short manner of speaking was when I ordered one
of the Carolina boatmen, who was drunk and had beaten an Indian, to be tied to a gun till he
was sober, in order to be whipped. Tomo Chichi came to me to beg me to pardon him, which I
refused to do unless the Indian who had been beaten should also desire the pardon for him.
Tomo Chichi desired him to do so, but he insisted upon satisfaction. Tomo Chichi said, "O Fonseka,"
(for that was his name,) "this Englishman, being drunk, has beat you; if he is whipped for
so doing, the Englishmen will expect that, if an Indian should insult them when drunk, the
Indian should be whipped for it. When you are drunk, you are quarrelsome, and you know you
love to be drunk, but you don't love to be whipped." Fonseka was convinced, and begged me to
pardon the man; which, as soon as I granted, Tomo Chichi and Fonseka ran and untied him, which
I perceived was done to show that he owed his safety to their intercession.

XIV.

DUKE OF ARGYLE A PATRON OF OGLETHORPE.

"From his boyhood Oglethorpe uniformly enjoyed the friendship and confidence of his gallant
and eloquent countryman, John Duke of Argyle; who, in an animated speech in Parliament, bore
splendid testimony to his military talents, his natural generosity, his contempt of danger,
and his devotion to the public weal."[1]

[Footnote 1: VERPLANK's Discourse before the New York Historical Society, p. 33.]

This favorable opinion, acquired in military campaigns, where his soldierly accomplishments
and personal bravery had attracted the notice and won the admiration of the commanding officers,
was preserved in after scenes, and confirmed by the principles which they both maintained,
and the measures they alike pursued in Parliament.

The Duke also early devoted himself to a military life, and served under the great Marlborough.
He distinguished himself at the battles of Ramilies, of Oudenarde, and Malplaquet, and assisted
at the siege of Lisle and of Ghent. Such services were honorably rewarded by the King, who
made him Knight of the Garter in 1710, and the following year sent him ambassador to Charles
III. of Spain, with the command of the English forces in that kingdom. His support of the union
with Scotland, rendered him for awhile unpopular with his countrymen, but his merits were acknowledged
by all parties. George I. on his accession, restored him to the command of Scotland, of which
he had before been capriciously deprived; and, in 1715, he bravely attacked Lord Mar's army
at Dumblane, and obliged the Pretender to retire from the kingdom. In 1718 he was made Duke
of Greenwich. He died in 1743, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a handsome monument
records his virtues.

The following couplet by pope immortalizes his fame.

He had the honor, also, to be celebrated in very high terms by THOMSON;

  --"full on thee, ARGYLE,
  Her hope, her stay, her darling and her boast,
  From her first patriots and her heroes sprung,
  Thy fond imploring country turns her eye;
  In thee, with all a mother's triumph, sees
  Her every virtue, every grace, combined,
  Her genius, wisdom, her engaging turn,
  Her pride of honor, and her courage tried,
  Calm and intrepid, in the very throat
  Of sulphurous war, on Tenier's dreadful field.
  Nor less the palm of peace inwreathes thy brow;
  For, powerful as thy sword, from thy rich tongue
  Persuasion flows, and wins the high debate;
  While, mix'd in thee, combine the charm of youth,
  The force of manhood, and the depth of age."

HISTORICAL REFERENCES TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE SALTZBURGERS IN GEORGIA.

Nachricht von dem establishment derer Salzburgischen emigranten zu Ebenezer, en der Provinz
Georgien in Nord-America, &c. Von P.G.F. VON RECK. Halle 1774. From this, and a subsequent
Journal of the same author, was published a very interesting little work, by the direction
of the Society for promoting Christian knowledge, entitled "An extract of the Journals of Mr.
Commissary VON RECK, who conducted the first transport of Saltzburgers to Georgia; and of the
Reverend Mr. BOLZIUS, one of their Ministers." London, 1734. 12mo.

A circumstantial account of the settlement and of the affairs of these emigrants is given in
a work which bears this title, "Ausfürliche Nacrichten von den Salzburgischen Emigranten, die
sich in America niedergelassen haben, worinnen die Riesediaria des konige. Grossbritannischen
Commissarii und der beyden Salzburgischen Prediger, wie auch eine Beschreibung von Georgien
enthalten. Heraus gegeben von SAMUEL URLSPERGER." Halle, 1735-52. This journal of the proceedings
of the Saltzburg emigrants, who formed the settlement of Ebenezer in Georgia, was continued
from year to year, from 1734 to 1760; in several parts, which, bound up, make five thick quarto
volumes. In Professor Ebeling's copy, now in the library of Harvard College, is the continuation,
in manuscript, [perhaps the original,] and which was never printed, by JOHN MARTIN BOLZIUS,
dated January, 1765. There is, also, a separate work, entitled Americanisches Ackerwerck Gottes,
von SAMUEL URLSPERGER. Augs. 1745-1760. 4to. 4 vol.

A most interesting account of the persecution is to be found in two thin quarto volumes by
J.M. TEUBENER, entitled Historie derer Emigranten oder Vertriebenen Lutheraner aus dem Ertz-Bissthum
Saltzburg. 2 vols. 4to. Leipz. 1732.

"About twenty-five thousand persons, a tenth part of the population, migrated on this occasion.
Their property was sold for them, under the King of Prussia's protection; some injustice, and
considerable loss must needs have been suffered by such a sale, and the chancellor, by whom
this strong measure was carried into effect, is accused of having enriched himself by the transaction.
Seventeen thousand of the emigrants settled in the Prussian states. Their march will long be
remembered in Germany. The Catholic magistrates at Augsburgh shut the gates against them, but
the Protestants in the city prevailed, and lodged them in their houses. The Count of Stolberg
Warnegerode gave a dinner to about nine hundred in his palace; they were also liberally entertained
and relieved by the Duke of Brunswick. At Leipsic the clergy met them at the gates, and entered
with them in procession, singing one of Luther's hymns; the magistrates quartered them upon
the inhabitants, and a collection was made for them in the church, several merchants subscribing
liberally. The university of Wittenberg went out to meet them, with the Rector at their head,
and collections were made from house to house. 'We thought it an honor,' says one of the Professors,
'to receive our poor guests in that city where Luther first preached the doctrines for which
they were obliged to abandon their native homes.' These demonstrations of the popular feeling
render it more than probable that if a religious war had then been allowed to begin in Saltzburg,
it would have spread throughout all Germany.

"Thirty-three thousand pounds were raised in London for the relief of the Saltzburgers. Many
of them settled in Georgia,--colonists of the best description. They called their settlement
Ebenezer. Whitfield, in 1738, was wonderfully pleased with their order and industry. 'Their
lands,' he says, 'are improved surprisingly for the time they have been there, and I believe
they have far the best crop of any in the colony. They are blest with two such pious ministers
as I have not often seen. They have no courts of judicature, but all little differences are
immediately and implicitly decided by their ministers, whom they look upon and love as their
fathers. They have likewise an orphan house, in which are seventeen children and one widow,
and I was much delighted to see the regularity wherewith it is managed.'"

SOUTHEY'S Life of Wesley, Vol. I. p. 98, note.

XVI.

With reference to these persecuted exiles, are the following lines of Thomson.

  "Lo! swarming southward on rejoicing suns
  New colonies extend'. the calm retreat
  Of undeserved distress, the better home
  Of those whom bigots chase from foreign lands;
  Such as of late an Oglethorpe has formed,
  And crowding round, the pleased Savannah sees."
                                [Liberty, Part V.]

I give, also, an extract from the London Journal of the day.

"As the Trustees for settling Georgia are giving all proper encouragement for the Saltzburg
emigrants to go over and settle there, some of the managers for those poor people have sent
over to the Trustees from Holland, a curious medal or device, enchased on silver, representing
the emigration of the poor Saltzburgers from their native country, which opens like a box,
and in the inside contains a map of their country, divided into seventeen districts, with seventeen
little pieces of historical painting, representing the seventeen persecutions of the primitive
Christians; the whole being folded up in a very small compass, and is a most ingenious piece
of workmanship."

XVII.

SETTLEMENT OF THE MORAVIANS IN GEORGIA.

"In consequence of the oppression which they suffered in Bohemia, the United Brethren, or,
as they are more commonly called, the Moravians, resolved to emigrate to the new Colony of
Georgia in America, whither the Saltzburgers had recently gone. With this purpose they applied
to Count Zinzendorf, their spiritual guide, for his concurrence and assistance. Accordingly,
he made interest with the Trustees on their behalf, which, being favorably received, and a
free passage offered, a small company of them set out from Herrnfurt in November, 1734. They
proceeded to London, where they found Mr. Spangenberg, who had nearly concluded every thing
relative to their embarkation, with the Trustees, and to their accommodation and settlement,
with General Oglethorpe. A number of Saltzburgers were also about to emigrate; and three zealous
ministers of the Church of England, Mr. John Wesley, together with his brother Charles, and
Mr. Benjamin Ingham, went with them in the same ship.

"They arrived at Savannah in the spring of 1735; and, in the following summer received a considerable
increase of brethren, conducted by David Nitchmann, senior.

"The Saltzburgers went further up the river, and selected a place of settlement, which they
called Ebenezer, but the Brethren began immediately their settlement near to Savannah; and
God so blessed their industry, that they were not only soon in a capacity of maintaining themselves,
but, also, of being serviceable to their neighbors. Having had assistance in the erection of
a school-house for the children of the Indians, Tomo Tschatschi, their King, came to see it,
and was glad that they might have a place where, as he expressed it, they could hear the good
word. Consequently the Colony of the Brethren presented a fair prospect, both with respect
to the settlement itself, and the instruction and conversion of the Heathen. But, being among
the rest summoned to take up arms in defence of the country, and to march against the Spaniards,
they refused it, as being no freeholders, and, of consequence, not obliged to it according
to the laws of the Colony; nay, before coming over, they had expressly stated that they were
not willing to perform any military service. Count Zinzendorf, on his visit to London, in January,
1737, took occasion to become acquainted with General Oglethorpe and the Trustees of Georgia,
with whom he entered into a conference relative to the situation of the Moravian Brethren there.
He remonstrated against their being called on to enlist as soldiers; and the Trustees readily
exempted them from such a liability. But as this exemption embittered the minds of the people
against them, some of the Brethren in 1738 left all their flourishing plantations, having repaid
all the money which had been advanced towards their passage and settlement, and went to Pennsylvania.
The rest were left undisturbed for awhile; but in 1739, when the troubles of war broke out
afresh, being again molested on account of military service, they followed their brethren in
the spring of 1740, and afterwards began the colonies of Bethlehem and Nazareth." CRANZ'S History
of the United Brethren, p. 193, 213 and 229.

SCOUT-BOAT.

1. This was a strong built ten-oared boat, bearing three swivel guns, kept for exploring the
river passages, visiting the islands, and for preventing the incursions of enemies, and repelling
the predatory attempts of runaway slaves who sometimes lurked round and infested the coast.
The crew was composed of bold and hardy South Carolinians, who lie out in the woods or in the
open boat, for months together. Most of them are good hunters and fishers; and by killing deer
and other game, subsist themselves, when the packed stores fail.

2. "Channels," as they are called, are water courses between the main-land and the islands;
in some places above a mile wide, in others, not above two hundred yards. These sometimes open
into what are called "sounds," which are gulfs of the sea, that extend into the land and entrances
of rivers.

The Uchee Indians had a village not far from Ebenezer, at the time of the settlement of Georgia;
but their principal town was at Chota, on the western branch of the Chattahoochee, or, as it
was more properly spelt, Chota-Uchee river. How long they had resided there we do not know.
As their language is a dialect of the Shawanees, it has been supposed that they were descendants
from that tribe. A jealousy existed between them and the Muscogees; but they were in amity
with the Creeks, though they would not mix with them. How numerous they were at the time of
their treaty with Oglethorpe, cannot now be ascertained.

In 1773 they lived on a beautiful plain of great extent, in a compact village. They had houses
made of timbers framed together, lathed and plastered over with a kind of red clay, which gave
them the appearance of having been built of brick. At that time they numbered 1500, of whom
300 were warriors. For many years they have not joined the Creeks in any of their games or
dances; and have only been kept from open hostility with other tribes, by the influence of
the white people.

[For this note I am indebted to my friend SAMUEL G. DRAKE; whose Biography and History of the
Indians of North America comprises much that can be known of the aborigines.]

XX.

OF THE MUTINY IN THE CAMP, AND ATTEMPT AT ASSASSINATION.

From the journal of William Stephens, Esq. (Vol. II. pp. 76, 90, 473, 480, 499, and 505; and
Vol. III. 4, 5, 27, and 32,) I collect the following particulars. One of the persons implicated
in the insidious plot, was William Shannon, a Roman Catholic. "He was one of the new listed
men in England, which the General brought over with him. By his seditious behavior he merited
to be shot or hanged at Spithead before they left it, and afterwards, for the like practices
at St. Simons. Upon searching him there, he was found to have belonged to Berwick's regiment,
and had a furlough from it in his pocket." Instead of suffering death for his treasonable conduct,
in the last instance, he was whipped and drummed out of the regiment. "Hence he rambled up
among the Indian nations, with an intent to make his way to some of the French settlements;
but being discovered by the General when he made his progress to those parts, in the year 1739,
and it being ascertained that he had been endeavoring to persuade the Indians into the interest
of the French, he fled, but was afterwards taken and sent down to Savannah, and committed to
prison there as a dangerous fellow." On the 14th of August, 1740, he and a Spaniard, named
Joseph Anthony Mazzique, who professed to be a travelling doctor, but had been imprisoned upon
strong presumption of being a spy, broke out of prison and fled. On the 18th of September,
they murdered two persons at Fort Argyle, and rifled the fort. They were taken on the beginning
of October at the Uchee town, and brought back to Savannah, tried and found guilty, condemned
and executed on the 11th of November, having previously confessed their crime.

Since my account of the traitorous plot was written, as also of the attempt at assassination,
I have received from my friend Dr. W.B. STEVENS, of Savannah, the following extracts from letters
of General Oglethorpe. As they state some particulars explanatory and supplementary of the
narrative which I had given, I place them here. And this I do the rather because DR. HEWATT,
(Vol. II. p. 70,) as also Major McCALL, (Vol. I. p. 124,) in the same words, and some others,
incorporate the treachery at St. Simons, and the assault at St. Andrews into a connected narrative,
as one occurrence; whereas it is very evident that the circumstances detailed were distinct;
one originating among the troops which sailed in the Hector and Blandford, in July 1738, from
England, and the other in the two companies drawn from the garrison at Gibraltar, which came
in the Whittaker in the preceding month of May.

In reference to the first, General Oglethorpe thus wrote in a letter to the trustees, dated,
"on board the Blandford at Plymouth, July 3d, 1738."

"We have discovered that one of our soldiers has been in the Spanish service, and that he hath
stroved to seduce several men to desert with him to them, on their arrival in Georgia. He designed
also to murder the officers, or such persons as could have money, and carry off the plunder.
Two of the gang have confessed, and accused him; but we cannot discover the rest. The fellow
has plenty of money, and he said he was to have sixty or a hundred crowns, according to the
number of men he carried. He is yet very obstinate, refusing to give any account of his correspondents.
We shall not try him till we come to Georgia, because we hope we shall make more discoveries."

"They left Plymouth on the 5th of July, and arrived about the 16th of September, at Frederica."

On the 8th of October, 1738, occurs the following passage in a letter from Frederica, to his
Grace the Duke of Newcastle.

"We have discovered some men who listed themselves as spies. We took upon one of them his furlough
from Berwick's regiment in the Irish troops. They strove to persuade some of our men to betray
a post to the Spaniards; who, instead of complying, discovered their intentions. I have ordered
a general Court Martial, for the trying of them, who have not yet made their report. One of
them owns himself a Roman Catholic, and denies the King having any authority over him."

"I conceive," says Dr. Stevens, "that these two letters refer to one and the same thing, viz.:
that there were spies, which came over with the troops who arrived in September; that they
designed to betray the English posts; that they were to murder the officers; and defeat the
object for which the regiment was sent to Georgia. But this plot was crushed by the fact of
its being discovered, the ring-leaders seized, and a Court Martial ordered."

Writing again to the Duke of Newcastle from Frederica, November 20, 1738, Oglethorpe says,--"Those
soldiers who came from Gibraltar, have mutinied. The King gave them provisions and pay at Gibraltar.
He gave them but six months provision here; after which they were to live upon their pay. On
the expiration of their provisions, they demanded a continuance of them, and not being able
to comply with their demands, they took to arms. One of them fired upon me. After a short skirmish
we got the better of them. One of the officers was slightly, and one of the mutineers dangerously
wounded, and five are secured prisoners, to be tried by a Court Martial. We have strong reason
to suspect that our neighbors have tampered with these men. Many of them speak Spanish, and
some of their boats,[1] under various pretences, came up hither before my arrival."

[Footnote 1: He refers here to boats from St. Augustine.]

Upon this Dr. Stevens remarks--"In this case the cause of mutiny had no reference to the Spaniards.
While in Gibraltar the troops had received provisions in addition to their pay. These were
continued six months after their arrival in America; but when these were withdrawn, and nothing
but their bare pay left, they became dissatisfied; demanded additional supplies; and, on refusal
by General Oglethorpe, took to their arms. Here was a simple cause originating among themselves;
in the other affair, the soldiers who created the difficulty were acting as agents of a foreign
power; the bribed and acknowledged traitors to their own country. In the one case it was the
sudden outbreaking of discontent, owing to the retrenchment of their wages; in the other, it
was a premeditated and well-concerted plan, framed by Spanish emissaries on the other side
of the water, to be executed on this."

Referring to the remark of General Oglethorpe at the close of the last letter, as also to some
suggestions in the letter of mine, to which the foregoing was the reply, Dr. Stevens adds--"That
the Spaniards tampered with the English, and endeavored to seduce them from their allegiance,
is not to be doubted; because it was of the utmost importance to them to create divisions in
the regiment; but the one to whom Hewatt refers, as having been 'in the Spanish service, and
had so much of a Roman Catholic spirit,' is doubtless the same spoken of by Oglethorpe in July,
upon whom a Court Martial sat in September; and who could not, therefore, have been connected
with the mutiny at Fort St. Andrews, in November."

FURTHER PARTICULARS OF TOMO CHICHI.

In the preceding pages are several references to Tomo Chichi, which show how strongly he became
attached to Oglethorpe; how liberal he was in the grant of territory; how considerate in furnishing
to the new settlers venison, wild turkeys, and other articles, as opportunity offered, and
the occasion made particularly acceptable; how serviceable he was in procuring such interviews
with the Chiefs of the Upper and Lower Creeks as led to amicable treaties; and how ready to
assist, not only with his own little tribe, but by his influence with others, in the contests
with the Spaniards. Some other notices of him, which bring out his excellent character more
prominently, but could not be inserted in the body of this work, I have deemed to be sufficiently
interesting to be inserted here.

"There were no Indians near the Georgians, before the arrival of Oglethorpe, except Tomo Chichi,
and a small tribe of about thirty or forty men who accompanied him. They were partly Lower
Creeks, and partly Yamasees, who had disobliged their countrymen, and, for fear of falling
sacrifices to their resentment, had wandered in the woods till about the year 1731, when they
begged leave of the Government of Carolina to sit down at Yamacraw, on the south side of Savannah
river."[1]

[Footnote 1: Report of the Committee of the South Carolina Assembly, on the Indian trade, 4to,
1736, p. 11.]

"Tomo Chichi had in his youth been a great warrior. He had an excellent judgment, and a very
ready wit, which showed itself in his answers upon all occasions. He was very generous in giving
away all the rich presents he received, remaining himself in a willing poverty, being more
pleased in giving to others, than possessing himself; and he was very mild and good natured."[1]

[Footnote 1: Gentleman's Magazine, 1740, Vol. X. p. 129.]

"While Oglethorpe was at Charlestown, in June 1733, an Indian shot himself in the vicinity.
His uncle, (who was a war-king,) and his friends, finding him dead, and fancying that he had
been murdered by the English, declared that they would be revenged on them. Tomo Chichi, being
informed of the uproar, came to the place and strove to quiet the Indians, saying that he was
persuaded it could not be the English who had killed him; and therefore desired that they would
inquire better into the matter. But the uncle, continuing in a great rage, Tomo Chichi bared
his breast and said to him, 'If you will kill any body, kill me; for I am an Englishman.' So
he pacified them; and, upon the thorough examination of the matter, it was found that for some
days he had been in despair, and desired several different Indians to shoot him; and an Indian
boy saw him kill himself in the following manner; he put the muzzle of his gun under his chin,
and with his great toe pushed the trigger."[1]

[Footnote 1: New England Weekly Journal for August 23, 1733.]

The visit of Tomo Chichi to England was greeted in some beautiful poetry, of which the following
stanza is an extract:

  "What stranger this? and from what region far?
  This wonderous form, majestic to behold?
  Unclothed, yet armed offensive for the war,
  In hoary age, and wise experience old?
  His limbs inured to hardiness and toil,
  His strong large limbs, what mighty sinews brace!
  Whilst truth sincere and artless virtue smile
  In the expressive features of his face.
  His bold, free aspect speaks the inward mind,
  Awed by no slavish fear, by no vile passion blind."

Major McCALL, after giving an account of the visit of the Indians to England, makes this declaration:
"Tomo Chichi acknowledged that the Governor of the world, or Great Spirit, had given the English
great wisdom, power, and riches, so that they wanted nothing. He had given the Indians great
extent of territories, yet they wanted every thing. Therefore he exerted his influence in prevailing
on the Creeks to resign such lands to the English as were of no use to themselves, and to allow
them to settle amongst them; that they might be supplied with useful articles for cultivation,
and necessaries of life. He told them that the English were a generous nation, and would trade
with them on the most honorable and advantageous terms; that they were brethren and friends,
and would protect them against danger, and go with them to war against their enemies." Vol.
I. p. 46.

Mr. WESLEY, in his Journal, writes July 1st, 1736: "The Indians had an audience, and another
on Saturday, when Chicali, their head man, dined with Mr. Oglethorpe. After dinner I asked
the grey-headed old man, 'What he thought he was made for?' He said, 'He that is above knows
what he made us for. We know nothing. We are in the dark. But white men know much. And yet
white men build great houses, as if they were to live forever. In a little time white men will
be dust as well as I.' I told him, 'if red men will learn the good book, they may know as much
as white men. But neither we nor you can know that book, unless we are taught by Him that is
above; and he will not teach you unless you avoid what you already know is not good.' He answered,
'I believe that; He will not teach us while our hearts are not white [pure]; and our men do
what they know is not good. Therefore he that is above does not send us the good book.'"

About TOMO CHICHI, the following is given in SPENCE'S Anecdotes, p. 318. (Ed. Lond. 1820.)

"When General Oglethorpe was conversing with a sensible old native of Georgia about prayer,
the latter said that 'they never prayed to God, but left it to him to do what he thought to
be best for them; that the asking for any particular blessing, looked to him like directing
God; and if so, must be a very wicked thing. That, for his part, he thought every thing that
happened in the world was as it should be; that God, of himself, would do for every one what
was consistent with the good of the whole; and that our duty to him was to be content with
whatever happened in general, and thankful for all the good that happened to us in particular.'"

The speech of Tomo Chichi, on presenting the feather of an Eagle to Oglethorpe, is very expressive
in his own laconic explication. By a little paraphrase it may be understood to import: "The
Eagle has a sharp beak for his enemies, but down on his breast for his friend. He has strong
wings, for he is aspiring; but they give shelter to feeble ones, for he is naturally propitious."

"TOMO CHICHI died on the 5th of October, 1739, at his own town, four miles from Savannah, of
a lingering illness, being aged about 97. He was sensible to the last minutes; and when he
was persuaded his death was near, he showed the greatest magnanimity and sedateness, and exhorted
his people never to forget the favors he had received from the King when in England, but to
persevere in their friendship with the English. He expressed the greatest tenderness for General
Oglethorpe, and seemed to have no concern at dying, but its being at a time when his life might
be useful against the Spaniards. He desired that his body might be buried among the English,
in the town of Savannah, since it was he that had prevailed with the Creek Indians to give
the land, and had assisted in the founding of the town. The corpse was brought down by water.
The General, attended by the Magistrates and people of the town, met it upon the water's edge.
The corpse was carried into the Percival square. The pall was supported by the General, Colonel
Stephens, Colonel Montaigute, Mr. Carteret, Mr. Lemon, and Mr. Maxwell. It was followed by
the Indians, and Magistrates, and people of the town. There was the respect paid of firing
minute guns from the battery all the time of the procession; and funeral firing by the militia,
who were under arms. LVII. p. 24. The account of the death and funeral of Tomo Chichi, much
like the above, is given in the Journal of W. STEPHENS, who was present. Vol. II. p. 153.]

As a frontispiece to one of the volumes of URLSPERGER'S Journal of the Saltzburg Emigrants,
is an engraving of Tomo Chichi and Toonahowi, which bears the inscription, "TOMO CHICHI, Mico,
and TOONAHOWI, the son of his brother, the Mice, or king of Etichitas; engraved in Augsburg
after the London original, by John Jacob Kleinshmidt."

In 1738, a dramatic entertainment in three acts, entitled Timbo Chiqui, was published by John
Cleland. [NICHOLS'S Literary Anecdotes, Vol. II. p. 459.]

TOONAHOWI was killed, valiantly fighting for the English against the Yamasee Indians, at Lake
di Pupa, in 1743.

MANIFESTO BY GENERAL OGLETHORPE.

Charlestown, April 1, 1740.

Whereas upon mature deliberation it is resolved to defend these Provinces by invading the Province
of Florida, and attacking St. Augustine, in order to remove the enemy that from thence may
molest his Majesty's subjects in America, which enemy both have and do continue to foment and
countenance the slaves to rebellion, burning houses, murders, and other cruelties, of which
the circumstances of the late massacre in this Province is too sad a proof; and whereas the
General Assembly of this Province hath ordered forces to be raised, so that an army composed
of various troops and Indians are to assist in invading the Spanish dominions of Florida; I,
therefore, to prevent any disorders that may arise in the said army by virtue of powers received
from his Majesty authorizing and empowering me, (for the better government of the forces during
their continuance under my command,) to prepare and publish such rules and ordinances as are
fit to be observed by all officers and soldiers: in regard, therefore, to the regiment of foot
raised in South Carolina, I do constitute and appoint that Alexander Vanderdussen, Esq., Colonel
of the said regiment, paid by the government of South Carolina, shall hold regimental courts
martial for the trials of such offences as shall be committed by the officers and soldiers
of that regiment; and that the said court martial shall consist of the officers of that regiment
only; and that the Colonel of the said regiment shall sit as President of the said regimental
courts martial, and make a report to me, and that according to the judgment of the said Courts
I shall cause sentence to be pronounced, in case I approve of the same, or otherwise suspend
the same as I shall see cause. And I do further declare that this authority shall continue
for the space of four months from the commencement of the said expedition, and no longer; and
that after the expiration of the said four months, or other sooner determination of the said
expedition, every officer and soldier, whether volunteers from, or in the pay of the government
of Carolina, shall have free liberty to depart and return to their habitations, and that a
free pass (if by them required,) shall be respectively granted unto them, against being impressed,
impeded, enlisted, or detained, by any authority, civil or military, whatsoever, that may be
exercised by or derived from me.

And I do further declare that if the officers of his Majesty's ships of war shall land men
to assist the land forces, one full moiety of all the plunder that shall be taken in such service,
shall go to the officers and men in his Majesty's said sea-service, whose ships are assisting
in the said expedition; and that all plunder taken and accruing to the officers and men in
the land service shall be divided among the officers and men of the land service, in the same
manner and proportion as prizes are distributed among the officers and men in his Majesty's
sea-service, according to the laws and rules of his Majesty's navy.

And I do further declare that whatever share of plunder shall come to me as General and commander
of the said forces, I will apply the same totally towards the relief of such men as may happen
to be maimed or wounded in the said expedition, and towards assisting the widows and children
of any of the said forces that may happen to be killed in the said service; and for the rewarding
of such as shall perform any distinguished brave action.

No Indian enemy is to be taken as a slave, for all Spanish and Indian prisoners do belong to
his Majesty, and are to be treated as prisoners, and not as slaves.

JAMES OGLETHORPE.

COLONEL PALMER.

"As no final agreement with respect to the limits of the two provinces had been concluded,
the Indians in alliance with Spain continued to harass the British settlements. Scalping parties
of the Yamasees frequently penetrated into Carolina; killed white men, and carried off every
negro they could find. Though the owners of slaves had been allowed from the Spanish government
a compensation in money for their losses, yet few of them ever received it. At length Colonel
Palmer resolved to make reprisals upon the plunderers. For this purpose he gathered together
a party of militia and friendly Indians, consisting of about three hundred men, and entered
Florida with a resolution of spreading desolation throughout the province. He carried his arms
as far as the gates of St. Augustine, and compelled the inhabitants to take refuge in their
castle. Scarce a house or hut in the Colony escaped the flames. He destroyed their provisions
in the fields; drove off their hogs, cattle, and horses; and left the Floridians little property,
except what was protected by the guns of their fort. By this expedition he demonstrated to
the Spaniards their weakness; and that the Carolinians, whenever they pleased, could prevent
the cultivation and settlement of their Province so as to render the improvement of it impracticable
on any other than peaceable terms with their neighbors."[1]

South Carolina, Vol. I. p. 137; where it is quoted, word for word, without acknowledgment.]

AN ACCOUNT OF THE SIEGE OF ST. AUGUSTINE, IN A LETTER FROM ON BOARD THE HECTOR.

"May 30th, [1740] we arrived near St. Augustine. June 1st we were joined by the Flamborough,
Captain Pearse; the Phoenix, Captain Fanshaw; the Tartar, Captain Townshend; and the Squirrel,
Capt. Warren, of twenty guns each; besides the Spence Sloop, Captain Laws, and the Wolf, Captain
Dandridge. On the 2d Colonel Vanderdussen, with three hundred Carolina soldiers, appeared to
the north of the town. On the 9th General Oglethorpe came by sea with three hundred soldiers
and three hundred Indians from Georgia: on the which they were carried on shore in the men-of-war's
boats, under the cover of the small ships' guns. They landed on the Island Eustatia, without
opposition, and took the look-out. The 13th Captain Warren, in a schooner and other armed sloops
and pettiauguas anchored in their harbor, just out of cannon shot, until the 26th, when the
sailors were employed in landing ordnance and other stores, within reach of the enemy's cannon.
On which occasion they discovered a surprising spirit and intrepidity. The same night two batteries
were raised; but too far off. The 27th the General summoned the Governor to surrender; who
sent word he should be glad to shake hands with him in his castle. This haughty answer was
occasioned by a dear-bought victory which five hundred Spaniards had obtained over eighty Highlanders,
fifty of whom were slain; but died like heroes, killing thrice their number. The 29th, bad
weather, obliged the men-of-war to put to sea, out of which but one man had been killed. Hereupon
the siege was raised."

Letter from General Oglethorpe to Rev. J.M. Bolzius.

REVEREND SIR,

Though God has not been pleased to prosper us with the success of taking St. Augustine, yet
we are to thank him for the safe return of the greatest part of our men, and that the pride
of our enemy has been curbed.

Those men who came from Ebenezer, and that were in the Carolina regiment, I have ordered to
be sent up to you again.

I recommend myself to your prayers,

and am, Reverend Sir,

Your most obedient humble servant,

JAMES OGLETHORPE.

Frederica, 5 August, 1740.

From the Gentleman's Magazine, for November, 1740.

A letter in the Daily Post of the 26th, dated from Charlestown, South Carolina, having laid
the ill success at Fort St. Augustine on the ill conduct of ----, some particulars of which
are: 1st, that the cattle taken at a cow-pen of one Diego, twenty-five miles from the town,
May 12, were not distributed to the soldiery; 2d, that the people might have entered the town
without opposition, but were not suffered; 3d, that the men were needlessly harassed; 4th,
that Colonel Palmer, who was sent to Negro Fort, two miles from the town, with one hundred
and thirty-three men to alarm the Spaniards was not supported by ----, who staid six or seven
miles off; 5th, that Colonel Palmer being attacked by five hundred Spaniards, shot three of
them after they had entered the fort; 6th, that Captain Warren was the life and spirit of the
cause; 7th, that the Volunteers, seeing no prospect of succeeding under such mad conduct, as
they called it, daily went off,--the following answer was published.

"Upon seeing a letter misrepresenting, in the most false and malicious manner, the late expedition
against St. Augustine; aiming thereby to defame the character of a gentleman, whose unwearied
endeavors for the public service, have greatly impaired his health; and as I, who am a Captain
in General Oglethorpe's regiment, was present, and acted upon that occasion as Brigadier Major,
and must know the whole transactions, I think it my duty to take notice of it.

"As to the cow-pen it speaks of, it is a square Fort, with four carriage guns and four swivel
guns, and had a garrison in it of forty-seven soldiers of the regular troops, and seven negroes,
who were all made prisoners of war. The cattle found there, and in parts adjacent, were distributed
to the King's troops and the Carolina regiment.

"In respect to the Carolina people being ready to enter the town of Augustine without opposition;
it is entirely false, and without the least foundation.

"In regard to Colonel Palmer's misfortune, who was killed in the first fire from the Spaniards;
he brought it upon himself by disobeying the orders he received, which positively enjoined
his keeping in the woods, and avoiding action, and by acting contrary to the advice of the
officers under his command, some of whom were present when he received his orders, and lodging
himself in the Negro Fort Moosa, where they were surrounded and defeated; the gates of which
fort, and the house within it, the General had before burnt.

"With respect to the Carolina Volunteers; that they did go away is certain, without leave given,
or asked, and their Captain with them. A Captain of the Carolina regiment also left his command
in the guard of the trenches, without being relieved, or asking any leave, and went with them.
After such behavior, what credit can be given to such men, though termed persons of note?

"As to Captain Warren, whose name is mentioned to endeavor to throw an odium elsewhere; I am
convinced by the personal acquaintance I have with him, that he will upon all occasions, do
his duty in the service of his King and country; as also Captain Law and Captain Townshend,
that were ashore with him.

"The morning after we landed upon the Island of Anastatia, I stood by while Captain Warren
read to General Oglethorpe a letter to Captain Pearse, then Commodore, acquainting him of our
landing without any loss, and the Spaniards withdrawing from that Island, on which Captain
Warren said, all that was now necessary to secure the reduction of the place, was the taking
of the Spanish galleys, which undertaking he would himself head with the King's boats under
the cannon of the fort, if he would give him leave. Several councils of war were held on board
his Majesty's ships by the sea captains, but Captain Warren's proposition was not undertaken.

"Lest malicious people should suggest that I might be sent to England by General Oglethorpe
on this occasion, I solemnly declare, that I came at my own desire by his leave, and had no
instructions from him, directly or indirectly, concerning this affair; but my regard to truth,
and abhorrence of all false and malicious reports whatsoever, have induced me to publish this,
to which I set my name. HUGH MACKLEY."

Johnson's Court, Charing Cross, Nov. 29, 1740.

SPANISH INVASION.

For details of the Spanish invasion in 1742, I refer to the Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. XII.
pages 494, 496, 550, and 661; and would here remark that Patrick Sutherland, Lieutenant of
General Oglethorpe's regiment, was sent express to England to give an account of the war, and
was furnished with a minute Journal of the occurrences; but, being taken by a Spanish privateer,
he threw his papers into the sea. A circumstantial relation, however, having been sent by another
conveyance to the Trustees, was attested and confirmed by Lieutenant Sutherland on his arrival
in London; and was published in the London Gazette of December 25th, and thence transferred
into the Gentleman's Magazine, for 1742, p. 693, and was afterwards repeated in the London
Magazine for 1758, p. 79. There is also in HARRIS'S Collection of Voyages, Vol. II. p. 324-347,
a very particular account of the Spanish invasion, which is introduced by the following remarks:
"As to the manner in which they executed it at last; and the amazing disappointment they met
with, notwithstanding the vast force they employed, and the smallness of that by which they
were assisted, we had so full, so clear, and so authentic an account published by authority,
that I know of no method more fit to convey an idea of it, or less liable to any exceptions
than transcribing it." Of this I have freely availed myself, and have distinguished the direct
quotations by inverted commas, but without repeating the references in marginal notes.

This account is concluded with the following remarks: "I must observe, before I conclude this
chapter, that if there be any thing in it which ought in a particular manner to claim the attention
of the public, it is, in a great measure, due to the lights afforded by the Honorable James
Oglethorpe, from whom, if the author has caught any part of that generous spirit which inclines
a man to bend all his thoughts and turn all his labors to the service of his country, it is
but just that he should acknowledge it; and this he is the more ready to do, because, if there
be any merit in his performance, capable of making it known to and esteemed by posterity, he
would willingly consecrate it as a mark of his esteem and gratitude for the many informations
he has received, and the right turn that has been given to his inquiries, by that knowing and
worthy person, who is equally happy in rendering the greatest personal services himself to
the community, and in infusing the like disposition in others, both by his example and conversation."

Some extracts are also inserted in my narrative from an account of the Invasion of Georgia,
taken from the Diary of the Preachers at Ebenezer. [URLSPERGER, Vol. IV. p. 1252.] This is
principally derived from intelligence by despatches to Savannah, and contains three letters
from Oglethorpe. Just as my manuscript was going to the press, I was favored by my obliging
friend, Dr. Stevens, of Savannah, with a copy of General Oglethorpe's despatch to the Duke
of Newcastle; in season, however, to profit by it.

XXVI.

COPY OF AN ORDER FOR A THANKSGIVING TO BE HELD TO THE PRAISE OF GOD, THAT HE HAS PUT AN END
TO THE SPANISH INVASION.[1]

[Footnote 1: From the German translation of the Reverend Mr. Bolzius.]

Almighty god has at all times displayed his power and mercy in the wonderful and gracious delivery
of his Church; and in the protection of pious and godly rulers and people, who have acknowledged
and served him, against the ungodly conspiracies and violent practices of all their enemies.
He has by the interposition of his Providence rescued us from the assaults of the Spaniards.
They came out against us with fourteen sail of light galleys, into Cumberland sound, but fear
came upon them, and they fled at his rebuke. Again they came with a mighty fleet of thirty-six
ships and vessels, into Jekyl sound, and after a sharp contest became masters of the fort,
since we had but four vessels to oppose their whole force; but He was there the shield of our
people; for, in the unequal conflict in which we held out bravely for four hours, not one of
our men was killed, although many of theirs were, and five by a single shot. They landed with
four thousand five hundred men upon this island, according to the account of the prisoners
we took, yea even of the Englishmen who escaped from them. The first party marched through
the woods towards this town, (Frederica) when, before a small number of our people, they were
dispersed, and fled. Another party which supported that, fought also, but was discomfited.
We may say surely the hand of God was raised for our defence, for in the two skirmishes more
than five hundred fled before fifty; though the enemy fought vigorously a long time, and, especially,
fired their grenades with great spirit; but their shooting did little hurt, so that not one
of us was killed; but they were thrown into great confusion, and pursued with so great loss,
that according to the account of the Spaniards since made prisoners, more than two hundred
returned not to their camp again. They advanced with their galleys against our fortress, but
were disappointed and withdrew without discharging a shot. After this, fear came upon them,
and they fled, leaving behind them some cannon, and many other things which they had taken
on shore. Next, with twenty-eight sail they attacked Fort William, in which there were only
fifty men, and after a contest of three hours, they desisted, and left the Province.

And so wonderfully were we protected and preserved, that in this great and formidable conflict
but few of our men were taken, and but three killed. Truly the Lord hath done great things
for us, by rescuing us from the power of a numerous foe, who boasted that they would conquer
and dispossess us. Not our strength or might hath saved us; our salvation is of the Lord. Therefore
it is highly becoming us to render thanks to God our deliverer. For this purpose, and in regard
to these considerations, I hereby appoint that the twenty-fifth day of this month should be
held as a day of public THANKSGIVING to Almighty God for his great deliverance, and the end
that is put to this Spanish invasion. And I enjoin that every one observe this festival in
a christian and godly manner; abstaining from intemperance and excess, and from all extravagant
signs of rejoicing.

Given under my own hand and seal this twenty-first day of July, at Frederica in Georgia, in
the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and forty-two.

JAMES OGLETHORPE.

[Under the date of September, the Rev. Mr. Bolzius makes this entry in his diary--"Mr. Jones
told me lately, that the people and soldiers at Frederica, on the day when the Thanksgiving
was held, observed such a stillness and good order as he had never seen there. There was also
a very pertinent and devout ascription of praise read, which he (and Mr. Jones is a good judge
of edifying things,) pronounce to be very excellent; and, moreover, he maintained that it must
have been prepared and composed by General Oglethorpe himself, for there was neither preacher
nor school-master at Frederica at that time."[1]]

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SILK CULTURE IN GEORGIA,

BY WILLIAM B. STEVENS, M.D.

One of the principal designs which influenced the settlement of Georgia, was the hope of thereby
creating a silk-growing province, where that material for which England had so long been indebted
to France, Italy and China, could be produced in this colonial dependency.

As early as 1609, the subject engaged the attention of the adventurers to Virginia, and in
a pamphlet, called "Nova Brittannia offering most excellent fruites by planting in Virginia,"
published that year, the writer says "there are silkeworms, and plenty of mulberie-trees, whereby
ladies, gentlewomen and little children (being set in the way to do it) may bee all imploied
with pleasure, making silke comparable to that of Persia, Turkey, or any other." In 1650, Mr.
Samuel Hartlib published a work entitled "Virginia Discovery of Silk Wormes, with their Benefits,"
in which he endeavored to show that the raising of silk was a thing very practicable in Virginia,
and even asserted that as a staple, it might be made superior to tobacco, in which opinion
he was confirmed by the judgment of several others. That they made some advances in this culture,
is evident from the fact that the Coronation robe of Charles II., in 1660, was made of silk
reeled in that colony, and even so late as 1730, three hundred pounds of the raw material were
exported from Virginia. Tobacco, however, soon assumed and maintained the ascendancy, to the
exclusion of this more useful and beautiful produce.

In 1703, Sir Nathaniel Johnson introduced the silk culture into South Carolina, but the astonishing
success which rewarded the casual introduction of rice into the plantation about eight years
before, precluded a just interest in the undertaking, and as a public and recognized commodity
it soon came to naught, though several persons, more for amusement than profit, still gave
their attention to it; and as late as 1755, Mrs. Pinckney, the same lady to whom the province
was indebted for the first cultivation of indigo ten years before, reeled sufficient silk in
the vicinity of Charleston to make three dresses, one of which was presented to the Princess
Dowager of Wales, another to Lord Chesterfield, and the third, says Ramsay, who narrates the
circumstance, "is now (1809) in Charleston in the possession of her daughter, Mrs. Horrey,
and is remarkable for its beauty, firmness and strength."

But notwithstanding these failures and the known difficulty of introducing a new branch of
agriculture into a country, as was evidenced by the compulsion which was necessary by Henry
IV. to introduce it into France, against the united voices of the merchants-traders, and even
in opposition to the Duke of Sully, and also the indifference manifested in England, notwithstanding
the able proclamation of King James on the subject, commanding its cultivation; the Trustees
for the settlement of Georgia determined to make one more effort, which, if successful, would
enrich both the province and the mother country. The views which they entertained, however,
of making Georgia supplant every silk-growing country, were extravagant and erroneous; they
expected, in fact, to supply all Europe, and to produce an article of equal strength, beauty
and value, with any made on the Continent. The Piedmontese, thought they, who pay half of their
silk for the rent of the mulberry trees and the eggs of the worm, or the peasants of France,
burdened with political difficulty and stinted for conveniences, could not cope with the settlers
of Georgia, where the mulberry (morus alba) trees would grow in the greatest luxuriance, where
timber for their fabrics was no expense, where room was abundant and the reward sure. By this
transfer, in addition to a direct saving to England of over 500,000l. which she paid for this
article to foreign countries, twenty thousand people were to find employment in rearing it
in Georgia, and as many more at home in preparing it for market.

Among the first emigrants who sailed with Oglethorpe from England in November 1732, was Mr.
Amatis, from Piedmont, who was engaged by the Trustees to introduce the art of silk-winding
into the colony, and who for that purpose brought with him several Italians and some adequate
machinery. White mulberry trees were planted in a portion of land on the eastern border of
the city, called the Trustees' garden; eggs were hatched, and silk spun "as fine as any from
France or Italy." They soon, however, came to a mutual rupture, and the whole process was for
a time suspended by the treachery of those employed, who broke the machinery, spoiled the seed,
destroyed the trees, and then escaped to Carolina. Sufficient, however, had been wrought to
test its value, and they were not discouraged by this inauspicious commencement. The Trustees
still adhered to their design, and the more effectually to advance it, required of every settler
that there should be on his grant, ten mulberry trees to each acre.

Mr. Camuse and his wife, both Italians, were now entrusted with this business, in which they
were continued six years; the two first at a salary of 60l. per annum, and the four last at
100l. besides the rent of a dwelling house and garden.

In June 1734, General Oglethorpe carried eight pounds of raw silk, the first produced in Georgia,
to England, which was followed by a small trunk full of the same article, on the 2d of April,
1735, and after being made into orgazine, by the engine of Sir Thomas Lombe, at Derby, who
said that it "proved exceedingly good through all the operations," was sent up to London on
the 13th of August, 1735, when the Trustees, together with Sir Thomas Lombe, waited on her
majesty Queen Caroline and exhibited to her the elegant specimen of Georgia silk. The queen
selected a portion of this parcel to be wove into a pattern, and being again waited on by these
gentlemen and Mr. Booth, the silk weaver, on the 21st of September, she expressed "a great
satisfaction for the beauty and fineness of the silk, the richness of the pattern, and at seeing
so early a product from that colony;" and to express her pleasure at such a favorable result,
a complete court-dress was made from it, and on His Majesty's next birth-day, she appeared
at the levee in a full robe of Georgia silk.

On the return of Oglethorpe, in 1735, he renewed his endeavors to bring it into active operation.
For the purpose of obtaining a sufficient quantity of seed, he allowed no silk to be reeled
that year, but let the worms deposit their eggs. He required, also, that the Italian women
should teach a number of the colonists, and thus render general the knowledge they could impart.
The Saltzburgers at Ebenezer were the most forward to adopt his views, and in March 28, 1736,
Rev. Mr. Bolzius gave one tree to each inhabitant as a present from Oglethorpe, and two of
his congregation were instructed in the art of reeling, by Mrs. Camuse. But though Oglethorpe
gave Mr. Bolzius trees, silk worms, and a book of instructions, yet he confesses that he felt
no interest in the business, nor inclination to pursue it.

In July, 1739, Mr. Samuel Augspourger carried over a parcel of raw silk which he received from
Mr. Jones, the Trustees' store-keeper in Savannah, and which was declared by eminent judges
to be "equal to any Italian silk, and worth full twenty shillings per pound."

On May 11, 1741, Mr. Bolzius in his journal states that twenty girls, during the last two months,
succeeded in making seventeen pounds of cocoons which were sold on Friday last at Savannah
for 3l. 8s. During this year, General Oglethorpe advanced to Bolzius 5l. for procuring trees,
for which sum he obtained twelve hundred, and distributed twenty-two to each family in his parish.

On May 1, 1742, fourteen pounds and fourteen ounces were sold, which brought 2l. 19s. 6d. Nearly
half of the silkworms died at Savannah, owing, as was then supposed, either to poisoned dew
or warm weather.

December 4, 1742, General Oglethorpe sent five hundred trees to Ebenezer, with the promise
of more if required. The indifference of the good Mr. Bolzius had by this time passed away,
and he was now a zealous advocate for its extension. A machine was erected near his house,
and two women succeeded very well, by which the people were stimulated to renewed exertions,
and a public Filature was contemplated. The enterprise of these Germans, seemed to excite the
envious disposition of Mrs. Camuse, with whom had been placed two women from Ebenezer; but
the conduct of Mrs. C. in withholding information, rendered their acquirement inadequate, and
Mr. Bolzius withdrew them from her charge. The first parcel of silk made, was sent to the Trustees,
who expressed themselves pleased with its quality. In 1745, the weight of cocoons was two hundred
and fifty-three pounds, and of spun silk sixteen and three-quarters. In 1746, the weight of
cocoons was three hundred and forty-four pounds, and of spun silk eighteen pounds. Early in
this year a machine for winding, and coppers for baking, together with appropriate treatises
on the art, were sent over by the Trustees, but the people were indifferent and apathetic.

The Germans, however, were as active as formerly, and Mr. Bolzius, in a letter to Von Munch,
dated May 6, 1747, says, that "the people last winter planted more mulberry trees than for
thirteen years before," for which he promised them a bounty of one shilling for every tree
which yielded one hundred pounds of leaves. The silk balls raised at this place this year,
were over four hundred pounds, three hundred and sixty-six pounds of which sold for 36l. 12s.
10-1/2d. The amount raised in the whole colony, was eight hundred and forty-seven pounds of
cocoons, and sixty-two pounds of spun silk. In 1748, the Saltzburgers reared four hundred and
sixty-four pounds, but their small trees were destroyed, and some of the larger ones injured,
by the late frost. They this year succeeded admirably in spinning twenty-four pounds of raw
silk, the want of a chimney and proper basins, which had impeded them before, in their rude
building, having been remedied. The President, writing to Secretary Martyn, December 11, 1746,
says, "The fundamental cause of its stagnation, is the unaccountable backwardness of some of
our dames and damsels to employ themselves in attending to the worms during the time of feeding,
which I have frequently taken notice of, and it cannot be imputed to the want of leaves."

During the same period only thirty-four pounds of spun silk were raised by the Trustees' agent
in Savannah. Mr. Bolzius, under date of February 15th, 1749, thus writes: "the weather being
now warm and pleasant, the mulberry trees have put forth their young leaves, and our people
are now turning their minds towards making of silk," and then, after expressing his surprise,
that so few were disposed to this culture, adds, "one reason for this reluctance, is ascribed
to the circumstance that, by ordinary labor, about two shillings might be obtained per day,
whereas scarcely a shilling could be earned in the same time, by the silk concern." Seven hundred
and sixty-two pounds of cocoons were raised, and fifty pounds thirteen ounces spun silk, and
there were two machines erected in Mr. Bolzius's yard which drew off twenty-four ounces per
day. On the 29th September, 1749, the Trustees promised 2l. to every woman, who shall make
herself mistress of the art of winding, in one year. And they also gave Rev. Mr. Bolzius permission
to erect ten sheds, with clay furnaces, at an expense of not more than 2l. each, and ten machines
for reeling, at thirty shillings each, which he says could be made better than those at Savannah
for 3l.; they also sent them ten basins, and the good Germans felt the impulse of this substantial
encouragement. In 1750, though the people in other parts of the colony mostly relinquished
the silk culture, the inhabitants of Ebenezer continued vigorously employed and interested
in it. On the 2d of June they received ten kettles from the Trustees, one of which, and a reeling
machine, were given to each mistress in the art of spinning, and two of the best artisans received
5l. for giving instruction to fourteen young women, to each of whom was bestowed 1l. for attention
and industry.

Over a thousand pounds of cocoons were raised at Ebenezer, and seventy-four pounds two ounces
raw silk made, producing (the price being then thirty shillings) over 110l. sterling. As illustrative
of the luxuriant growth of the mulberry, it may be interesting to state, that two trees in
front of the Parsonage, ten years old, measured three feet eight inches in circumference. In
December of this year, eight more copper basins were received, and public confidence in the
success of the undertaking seemed revived, notwithstanding Mr. Camuse and family had left the
Province, and settled at Purysburgh, in South Carolina.

On the 25th December, 1750, Mr. Pickering Robinson, who, together with Mr. James Habersham,
had been appointed the preceding August a commissioner to promote more effectually the culture
of silk, arrived in Savannah.

Mr. Robinson had been sent to France, at the expense of the Trustees, to study the management
of filatures and the necessary processes for preparing the article for market, and thus, though
no operative, was qualified to take the directorship of so important a branch of industry.
His salary was 100l. per annum; 25l. for a clerk, and a tract of land was also granted him,
which, in 1763, sold for 1300l.

Mr. Robinson brought with him a large quantity of silkworm seed, but all failed, save about
half an ounce; the commissioners determined at once to erect a filature, which should be a
normal school to the whole province, and it was their opinion that it would be "a sufficient
nursery to supply, in three or four years, as many reelers as will be wanted, when we make
no doubt of many private filatures being erected, which can only make their culture a general
staple." The dimensions were thirty-six feet by twenty, rough boarded, with a loft or upper
story, for the spreading out of the green cocoons. It was commenced on the 4th of March, 1751.
On the 1st of April, the basins were put up, and on the 8th of May the reeling began. To encourage
the colonists, the Trustees proposed to purchase all the balls, and wind them at their own
expense, and paid from 1s. 6d. to 2s. 4d. per pound for green cocoons. The Commissioners separated
the cocoons into three sorts: 1st, perfect cones; 2d, the spongy and fuzzy; and 3d, the spotted,
stained, and dupions. This arrangement, however, gave great offence to some of the residents
in Savannah and Purysburgh, and Messrs. Robinson and Habersham requested the Vice President
and assistants to determine the respective prices and publicly announce the same, which they
did on the 26th April, by a proclamation, wherein by way of bounty, they promised to pay for
cocoons delivered at their store in Savannah, the following sums, namely, for cocoons made
by one worm, hard, weighty and good substance, 2s. per pound; for the weaker quality, pointed,
spotted, or bruised, 1s. 3d.; for dupions (those made by two worms), 6d.; for raw silk, from
1st quality cocoons 14s. per pound; for that made from 2d quality, 12s.; the product of the
double cones, 6s. per pound; and they also offered, if delivered at the filature, for best
cocoons, 3s. 6d.; for middling 1s. 8d.; and for inferior 1s. 1d., a series of prices truly
astonishing, when we reflect that the real merchantable worth of a pound of cocoons is scarcely
ever 6d.

Experiments were made at the filature to ascertain the relative quantity of each of these qualities,
in a given weight of cocoons, and the results were, that in fifty pounds of green cocoons,
there were twenty-seven pounds of the first sort, ten pounds four ounces of the second, and
twelve pounds twelve ounces of the third. After curing or baking, these fifty pounds weighed
only forty-six pounds five ounces, showing a loss in ponderosity of nearly eight per cent.
Beside the arrangement above specified, the cocoons were still further divided for the purpose
of reeling into white and yellow, and these again, subdivided into five each, namely, 1st,
hard and weighty; 2d, little woolly and weaker; 3d, very woolly and soft; 4th, spotted and
much bruised; 5th, double worms.

Mr. Camuse, son, and daughter, who, it appears, gave the commissioners no little trouble by
their perverse conduct, returned to Savannah and were engaged to labor at the filature, at
three shillings per day, at which Mr. Habersham exclaims, "monstrous wages!" The reelers now
advanced with much proficiency, and five of them, on the 10th of May, wound off eleven pounds
of cocoons each. The proportion of raw silk to the cocoons, appeared, on a variety of trials,
to be nearly in this ratio:--

                                                            oz.
  10th May, 1751, 55 lbs. cocoons, 1st quality, produced 117-7/8.
  11th  "     "    8  "      "      "   " 6-9 per thread  18-1/2.
  13th  "     "   11  "      "      "   "       produced  21-1/2.
  15th  "     "   55  "      "      2d  "           "    109.
  18th  "     "   20  "      "      "   "           "     24.
  22d   "     "   15  "      "      1st "           "     20-3/4.
  "     "     "   10  "      "      2d  "           "     13-1/2.

The whole amount of cocoons raised in the province, was six thousand three hundred and one
pounds, of which two thousand pounds came from Ebenezer, and four thousand pounds were made
at Whitefield's Orphan-house. Two hundred and sixty-nine pounds and one ounce of raw silk,
and one hundred and sixty-one pounds of filogee, were prepared, notwithstanding over three
hundred and eighty pounds were lost by vermin, fire and mould. The expense of the culture was
large this year, owing to the erection of the filature, &c., which swelled the sum to 609l.
9s. 8-1/2d. sterling. The private journals of that day kept at Savannah and Ebenezer, acquaint
us, in some measure, with the arduous nature of the commissioners' labors, and the difficulties
they encountered from the want of funds, the intractableness of laborers, the novelty of the
attempt, the imperfections of machinery, and the bitter opposition of those who should have
sustained and encouraged them. The public duties of Mr. Habersham prevented his constant attention
to this business; but the whole time of Mr. Robinson was devoted to the filature, directing
the sorters, aiding the novices, advising the reelers, and in every way exerting himself to
obtain success. His engagement with the Trustees expired on the 30th of August, 1751, but finding
that his intended departure depressed the friends of the culture, he was solicited by the local
government to remain another year, and, generously sacrificing private to public interests,
he complied with their request. Mr. Habersham thus speaks of Mr. Robinson. "I think him the
most prudent as well as the most capable person I ever knew, to undertake such a work, and
if he could be continued here, I doubt not but that he would turn out a number of well instructed
reelers, who would be able to conduct filatures at Ebenezer, Augusta, and other parts of the
province." So great was the confidence which the Trustees had in him, that he was appointed
an assistant in the government at Savannah; an honor which he declined, and in the same letter
stated, "If due encouragement be not given to the culture of raw silk, for the term of at least
fourteen years, I positively cannot think of settling in America." These gentlemen recommended
the building of a house, sixty feet by twenty-six, as a cocoonry, great loss having been experienced
for the want of such a structure.

In 1752, Mr. Robinson returned to England, and his place was partially supplied by Joseph Ottolenghe,
a native of Piedmont, and a proficient in his art, who came to Georgia on the 18th of July,
1751, and took charge of the filature in April, 1753. In a letter to Lee Martyn, dated September
11, 1753, Mr. Ottolenghe says, that "there were fewer cocoons raised this year, as the worms
mostly hatched before the trees leaved," and that "the people were willing to continue the
business." One hundred and ninety-seven pounds of raw silk were made this year, and three hundred
and seventy-six pounds in 1754, besides twenty-four pounds of filosele. The people of Augusta
became interested in this manufacture, and entered with considerable spirit into the undertaking,
promising to send hands to Savannah, yearly, to learn the art of reeling: their enthusiasm,
however, soon evaporated.

On the 29th of March, 1755, a certificate, signed by thirty-nine eminent silk-throwsters and
weavers, was given to the "Commissioners for Trade and Plantations," stating that after examining
three hundred pounds of raw silk, imported from Georgia, "we do sincerely declare that the
nature and texture is truly good, the color beautiful, the thread as even and as clear as the
best Piedmont (called wire silk) of the size, and much clearer and even than the usual Italian
silks;" and furthermore, "it could be worked with less waste than China silk, and has all the
properties of good silk well adapted to the weaver's art in most branches."

In 1755, five thousand four hundred and eighty-eight pounds of cocoons were raised, and four
hundred and thirty-eight pounds of raw silk spun. The good effects of the filature were now
happily evident in the increased interest of the planters in the subject, who sent both their
daughters and young negroes to acquire the art of reeling. In 1756, three thousand seven hundred
and eighty-three pounds and one ounce of cocoons were received at the filature, and two hundred
and sixty-eight pounds of raw silk reeled.

The liberal policy of the commissioners, who had no private ends to answer, caused them to
recommend the establishment of additional filatures, and in their letter to the Trustees, June
12th, 1751, they advise the erection of one at Ebenezer, and another contiguous to Savannah,
but Mr. Ottolenghe opposed this course and arrogated to the one in Savannah the entire monopoly
of the culture. Jealousy appears to have been very conspicuous in Mr. Ottolenghe's character,
and his opposition to the Saltzburgers and depreciation of their efforts, arose from this suspicious
trait. He aimed to render himself solely necessary, and aspersed everything which seemed to
militate with his fancied superiority. This appears not only from letters of Governors Reynold
and Ellis, but from his own correspondence, where this caution and fear of rivalry is plainly
discernible. His course gave offence to the Ebenezer people, who had already erected a filature
in their village; who had been at great sacrifice to send their wives and daughters to learn
the art of reeling in Savannah, and who had hoped to carry on the manufacture under their own
supervision and for their own benefit. Mr. Ottolenghe, however, overruled their views and required
all cocoons to be delivered at Savannah and to be reeled there. Each basin at the filature
had two apprentices, besides others who were employed in sorting the balls, &c., and the various
operations connected with the trade, employed nearly forty persons.

In 1757, over five thousand pounds of cocoons were received at Savannah, and three hundred
and sixty pounds of raw silk spun, which, says Governor Ellis, would have been more, if the
eggs had not failed; and in a letter, dated 11th of March, 1757, he says "the raising of silk
seems to be no longer a matter of curiosity, it employs many poor people, and is approaching
towards a staple."

Seven thousand and forty pounds of cocoons were deposited in the filature in 1758, but while
the friends of this business were rejoicing in the assured success of their experiment they
were saddened by the destruction of the filature, which took fire on the 4th of July, and was
totally consumed. The wound silk, which had not yet been shipped, amounting to three hundred
and fifty pounds, was saved, but several thousand weight of silk balls, together with much
of the reeling apparatus, were destroyed. Another and more capacious building was immediately
erected and was ready for use the ensuing season.

In 1759, ten thousand one hundred and thirty-six pounds of cocoons were raised in Georgia,
four thousand pounds of which were from Ebenezer, and the proceeds of their culture alone,
for the season, reached 700l. sterling. The opinion of those engaged in the culture, as expressed
to Dr. Jared Elliot, was, "that it was more profitable than any other ordinary business."

The cocoons delivered at the filature in 1760, weighed seven thousand nine hundred and eighty-three
pounds, and there were spun eight hundred and thirty-nine pounds. Mr. Ottolenghe was now honored
with the full appointment of "superintendant of the silk culture in Georgia," with a salary
appropriate to his station.

Five thousand three hundred and seven pounds of cocoons, and three hundred and thirty-two pounds
of raw silk were produced in 1761. Governor Wright, under date 13th of July, says, "The greatest
appearance that ever they had here was destroyed in two nights' time, by excessive hard and
unseasonable frosts, and there is likewise a degeneracy in the seed, as Mr. Ottolenghe tells
me." These frosts occurred on the 5th and 6th of April. Parliament, this year, made a grant
of 1000l. towards defraying the expenditure for the silk culture, and it was annually renewed
until about 1766. By means of this gratuity, Mr. Ottolenghe was enabled to give a high price
to the rearers of cocoons, and thus sustain the encouragement so judiciously commenced.

In 1762, fifteen thousand one hundred and one pounds of cocoons were delivered at the filature,
and one thousand and forty-eight pounds of raw silk reeled, which Mr. O. declared to be the
finest and best silk ever produced in Georgia.

The year 1763 showed an increase of cocoons but a decrease of silk, there being fifteen thousand
four hundred and eighty-six pounds of the former, and only nine hundred and fifty-three pounds
of the latter. The occasion of this disparity was a season of cold, rainy weather, towards
the close of April, by which the later cocoons were injured and rendered almost useless.

There were delivered at the filature, in 1764, fifteen thousand two hundred and twelve pounds
of cocoons, notwithstanding the season was so unfavorable, that Governor Wright mentions the
case of one man who expected to make from five to seven hundred pounds, who only succeeded
in raising one hundred pounds of cocoons. Eight thousand six hundred and ninety-five pounds
were sent by the Saltzburgers, and the whole amount yielded eight hundred and ninety-eight
pounds of raw silk.

In addition to the grant of Parliament, a Society, instituted in London, for the encouragement
of arts, manufactures and commerce, offered certain premiums for the advantage of the British
American dominions, among which were:

"For every pound of cocoons produced in the province of Georgia and South Carolina, in the
year 1764, of a hardy, weighty and good substance, wherein only one worm has spun, 3d.; for
every pound of cocoons produced in the same year, of a weaker, lighter, spotted or bruised
quality, 2d.; for dupions, 1d." These premiums were to be paid under the direction of Mr. O.,
with proper vouchers that the same were raised in either of the provinces specified.

It was agitated in 1765, to reduce the price of cocoons from 3s. to 1s. 6d. per pound, a measure
which produced much dissatisfaction and as a consequence there was a considerable falling off
in the amount of balls and silk, only twelve thousand five hundred and fourteen pounds of the
former, and seven hundred and twelve pounds of the latter, together with seven hundred and
twenty pounds of filosele being produced. To prevent the depression consequent on this reduction,
Governor Wright suggested, that instead of so much per pound, as formerly, that the ten largest
quantities should receive the highest, 50l., the next greatest parcel 45l., and so on, gradually
decreasing with the decrease in weight, until you reached the lowest quantity, to which 10l.
would be awarded; thus, while the expense would be greatly lessened to the Trustees, the stimulus
of reward would be sufficiently sustained. This advice was not adopted, though owing to the
urgent remonstrances of those best acquainted with the business, the reduction in the bounty
was only 9d. instead of 1s. 6d. On the 25th April, 1765, the following order was published
in the "Georgia Gazette:"

"Notice is hereby given to all whom it may concern, that, by direction of the Right Honorable
the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, the price usually paid for cocoons is now
reduced, and that no more than 2s. 3d. per pound will be paid for cocoons raised in this province,
and delivered at the public filature this season.

"By order of His Excellency the Governor.

"GEO. BAILLIE, Commissary"

This bounty was still further reduced in 1766, when by order of the Board of Trade, only 1s.
1d. was paid per pound. The dependence of this culture on the weather, was signally instanced
this year, from the fact that though many who had hitherto raised cocoons, abandoned it at
the reduction of the bounty, yet such a large crop had never been produced before; over twenty
thousand three hundred and eighty pounds of cocoons being delivered at the filature, which,
however, only produced one thousand eighty-nine pounds of raw silk, and eight hundred and fifty
pounds of filosele. This amount of reeled silk was not at all proportionate to the weight of
the cones, resulting, as Mr. Ottolenghe said in a letter to Governor Wright, October 2, 1766,
"to the badness of the seed, and consequent inferiority of the worms." In 1760, the cocoons
weighed only seven thousand nine hundred and eighty-three pounds, and yet eight hundred and
thirty-nine pounds of raw silk were spun; at which rate, the product this year should have
been about two thousand pounds.

On the 26th of June, Henry Kennan made proposals to the Board of Trade, for carrying on the
filature; but they were of a nature not at all advantageous to the culture, and Governor Wright,
in his reply, on the 21st of October, disapproved of the plan, and exposed the fallacy of his
scheme, which was in consequence abandoned.

In 1767, ten thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight pounds of balls were raised, and six hundred
and seventy-one pounds nine ounces of raw silk spun; the decrease of cocoons being caused,
first, by withdrawing of the Purysburgh cocoons, which last year amounted to five thousand
five hundred and fifty-one pounds; and second, by the reduction of bounty, so that while last
year the cocoons were delivered in by two hundred and sixty-four different persons, only one
hundred and sixty individuals were this year devoted to the culture. The silk, however, was
of a better quality, and sustained its high reputation in the London market.

In 1768, another plan was proposed, by Mr. Delamar, "in order the more effectually to establish
the growth of raw silk in America." His proposal was, to pay a bounty of 20s. per pound on
every pound of good, clear raw silk imported from any of his Majesty's dominions in America,
to be paid on the price such silk might sell for at public sale in London; at the expiration
of ten years, ten per cent. bounty was to be allowed; the ensuing five years at five per cent.,
after which time the bounty was to cease. This was the general feature of his plan; it was
not, however, adopted, though in many respects its provisions were highly judicious and appropriate.

But this branch of industry and commerce was fast waning before the increasing culture of more
sure and lucrative products, and only one hundred and thirty-seven different persons brought
cocoons to the filature this year. Governor Wright, in his official letter to the Earl of Hillsborough,
July 1, 1768, says, "I am persuaded that few, or none but the very poorer sort of people, will
continue to go upon that article. Several substantial persons, who did mean to make it an object
when the price was higher, have, to my knowledge, given it over. The reason, my Lord, is evident;
for people who have their fortune to raise or make, will always turn themselves in such a way,
and to the raising and making of such commodities, as they think will answer best; and it is
very clear to me, that those who have negroes, may employ themselves and negroes to better
advantage, &c., than by raising cocoons at 1s. 6d. per pound, although that is, as I have said,
7, 8, or 9d. more than they are intrinsically worth."

Cluny, in his "American Traveller," printed in London, 1769, says, "The climate of Georgia
has been found to agree in every respect with the silk worm." Experience, however, proved that
the climate was not sufficiently equable to secure permanent and continued success. Governor
Wright, in the letter quoted above, says, "the variable and uncertain weather in spring, makes
it precarious," and facts amply confirm this statement. Only five hundred and forty-one pounds
of raw silk were made this year, a smaller amount, with one exception, than had been produced
for ten years. In 1769, the quantity was still more decreased, both from the reluctance of
the people to raise worms, and the unfavorable weather in spring. Governor Wright, on the 20th
of June, 1769, says, "We had a most extraordinary prospect, till the middle of April, when
I thought every thing safe, yet we had very cold rains on the 17th and 18th, which were succeeded
by hard black frost on the 19th and 20th, and destroyed a great part of the worms, and will
reduce the silk very much."

The silk business was now on the irretrievable decline, though it still maintained a nominal
existence, and received the encouragement of Parliament. The special bounty which had hitherto
been paid on cocoons, over and above their merchantable value, was suspended, and by a statute
of 9 Geo. III., c. 38, a premium of twenty-five per cent. from the 1st of January, 1770, to
the 1st of January, 1777,--of twenty per cent, from the 1st of January, 1777, to the 1st of
January, 1784,--and of fifteen per cent. from the 1st of January, 1784, to the 1st of January
1791, on the ad valorem value of all silk produced in America and imported into Great Britain
in vessels regularly navigated by law, was substituted in its place.

The inhabitants of Ebenezer resumed the culture, which with them had long been dormant, and
its revival at that time was principally owing to the influence of a very worthy man and magistrate,
Mr. Wertsch, who, sanguine himself of ultimate success, had imparted to the Germans a portion
of his own enthusiasm.

In 1770, they shipped two hundred and ninety-one pounds of raw silk, the result of their own
industry, and as the filature at Savannah was discontinued in 1771, the Earl of Hillsborough,
ever anxious to advance the produce, warmly commended the zeal of the Saltzburgers, and directed
President Habersham to distribute "the basins and reels that were left in the public filature,
to such persons as Mr. Wertsch shall recommend to be proper objects of that bounty;" and in
the same letter he promised that he would endeavor to procure for them, this year, "a small
sum from Parliament, to be laid out in purchase of utensils for the assistance of the poor
sort of people in your province." This promise he redeemed.

So popular had the silk business become at Ebenezer, that Mr. Habersham, in a letter dated
the 30th of March, 1772, says, "some persons in almost every family there, understand its process
from the beginning to the end." In 1771, the Germans sent four hundred and thirty-eight pounds
of raw silk to England, and in 1772, four hundred and eighty-five pounds, all of their own
raising. They made their own reels, which were so much esteemed that one was sent to England
as a model, and another taken to the East Indies by Pickering Robinson. The operations at Savannah
were now totally discontinued, though Mr. Ottolenghe still styled himself "Superintendent of
the Silk Culture in Georgia," and in consideration of his long and faithful service in that
office, received an annuity of 100l.

In a message of Sir James Wright, to the Commons House of Assembly, 19th of January, 1774,
he says, "The filature buildings seem to be going to decay and ruin; may it not, therefore,
be expedient to consider what other service or use they may be put to?" and the Assembly answered,
"We shall not fail to consider how it may be expedient to apply the filature to some public
use;" and henceforth it was used as an assembly or ball-room, a place where societies held
their meetings, and where divine service was occasionally conducted: more recently, it was
converted into a dwelling-house, and was thus appropriated at the time of its destruction by
fire, on the afternoon of March 25, 1839.

Thus ended the grand project for raising silk in the Province of Georgia; for though some few
individuals, together with the people of Ebenezer, continued to raise small quantities, yet,
as a branch of general culture, it has never been resuscitated. The last parcel brought to
Savannah was in 1790, when over two hundred pounds were purchased for exportation, at from
8s. to 26s. per pound.

On reviewing the causes which led to the suspension of this business, after so many exertions
and such vast expense, which, it must be remembered, the profits of the culture never reimbursed,
we find, first, the unfriendliness of the climate, which, notwithstanding its boasted excellence,
interfered materially with its success. Governor Wright, frequently speaks of its deleterious
influence, and the fluctuations in the various seasons, evidenced, to demonstration, that the
interior was better adapted to the agricultural part of the business, than the exposed and
variable sea-board. Mr. Habersham, in a letter to the Earl of Hillsborough, dated "Savannah,
24th of April, 1772," thus expresses himself on this point. "Upwards of twenty years ago, if
my memory does not fail me, Samuel Lloyd, Esq., of London, who was one of the late trustees
for establishing this colony, and was fourteen years in Italy, and very largely concerned in
the silk business, wrote to me, that the best silk was produced at a distance from the sea-coast,
owing, I suppose, to the richness of the soil, which made the mulberry leaf more glutinous,
nutritive and healthy to the silk-worm; also, to their not being obnoxious to musquetoes and
sand-flies, and probably, likewise, to the weather being more equal and less liable to sudden
transition from heat to cold: and on a conversation this day with Mr. Barnard, of Augusta,
he assures me, that from two years experience in raising cocoons there, he lost none from sickness,
which frequently destroys two-thirds of the worms here;" and he further says, that Mr. Ottolenghe
told him that the silk reeled from the Augusta cocoons "made the strongest and most wiry thread
of any raised in these parts."

Second, the expensiveness of living, and the dearness of labor, which was as high as 1s. 8d.
to 2s. per day, whereas 2d. or 3d. was the usual price paid the peasant in silk-growing countries.
Governor Wright, in a letter to the Earl of Hillsborough, frankly told him that, "till these
provinces become more populous, and labor cheaper, I apprehend, silk will not be a commodity,
or an article, of any considerable amount."

Third, the great reduction of the bounty, which, being the stimulus to exertion, ceased to
operate as an incentive, when from 3s. 3d. it fell to 1s. 3d., and finally to a mere premium
on the general quantity imported. The poor could not subsist on these prices, and the rich
could employ their lands to much better advantage than in cultivating an article which would
not repay the expenses of labor: and lastly, the increasing attention, bestowed on rice and
cotton, sealed the fate of the silk culture, and the planters soon learned to consider the
latter of no importance in comparison, with the large and lucrative crops yielded by these
more staple commodities. Other reasons might be mentioned, but these sufficiently account for
its decline there, and its total neglect even to the present day. During the morus multicaulis
epidemic, which spread over our country in 1838, Savannah, it is true, did not escape, and
for a time the fever raged, with much violence, but the febrile action soon subsided, leaving
no permanent benefit and only a few fields of waving foliage, as a deciduous memento of this
frenzied excitement.

That silk can be produced in Georgia equal to any in the world, does not admit of a doubt,
but whether it will ever be resumed, and when, is among the unknown events of the future.
