  PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.

  CHAPTER I.--SYSTEMS OF MYTHOLOGY.

  Definitions of religion--Contradictory evidence--"Belief in
  spiritual beings"--Objection to Mr. Tylor's definition--Definition
  as regards this argument--Problem: the contradiction between
  religion and myth--Two human moods--Examples--Case of Greece--
  Ancient mythologists--Criticism by Eusebius--Modern mythological
  systems--Mr. Max Muller--Mannhardt.

  CHAPTER II.--NEW SYSTEM PROPOSED.

  Chapter I. recapitulated--Proposal of a new method: Science of
  comparative or historical study of man--Anticipated in part by
  Eusebius, Fontenelle, De Brosses, Spencer (of C. C. C., Cambridge),
  and Mannhardt--Science of Tylor--Object of inquiry: to find
  condition of human intellect in which marvels of myth are parts of
  practical everyday belief--This is the savage state--Savages
  described--The wild element of myth a survival from the savage
  state--Advantages of this method--Partly accounts for wide
  DIFFUSION as well as ORIGIN of myths--Connected with general
  theory of evolution--Puzzling example of myth of the water-
  swallower--Professor Tiele's criticism of the method--
  Objections to method, and answer to these--See Appendix B.

  CHAPTER III.--THE MENTAL CONDITION OF SAVAGES--CONFUSION WITH
                  NATURE--TOTEMISM.

  The mental condition of savages the basis of the irrational element
  in myth--Characteristics of that condition: (1) Confusion of all
  things in an equality of presumed animation and intelligence;
  (2) Belief in sorcery; (3) Spiritualism; (4) Curiosity; (5) Easy
  credulity and mental indolence--The curiosity is satisfied, thanks
  to the credulity, by myths in answer to all inquiries--Evidence for
  this--Mr. Tylor's opinion--Mr. Im Thurn--Jesuit missionaries'
  Relations--Examples of confusion between men, plants, beasts and
  other natural objects--Reports of travellers--Evidence from
  institution of totemism--Definition of totemism--Totemism in
  Australia, Africa, America, the Oceanic Islands, India, North Asia--
  Conclusions: Totemism being found so widely distributed, is a proof
  of the existence of that savage mental condition in which no line
  is drawn between men and the other things in the world.  This
  confusion is one of the characteristics of myth in all races.

  CHAPTER IV.--THE MENTAL CONDITION OF SAVAGES--MAGIC--
                 METAMORPHOSIS--METAPHYSIC--PSYCHOLOGY.

  Claims of sorcerers--Savage scientific speculation--Theory of
  causation--Credulity, except as to new religious ideas--"Post hoc,
  ergo propter hoc"--Fundamental ideas of magic--Examples:
  incantations, ghosts, spirits--Evidence of rank and other
  institutions in proof of confusions of mind exhibited in magical
  beliefs.

  CHAPTER V.--NATURE MYTHS.

  Savage fancy, curiosity and credulity illustrated in nature myths--
  In these all phenomena are explained by belief in the general
  animation of everything, combined with belief in metamorphosis--Sun
  myths, Asian, Australian, African, Melanesian, Indian, Californian,
  Brazilian, Maori, Samoan--Moon myths, Australian, Muysca, Mexican,
  Zulu, Macassar, Greenland, Piute, Malay--Thunder myths--Greek and
  Aryan sun and moon myths--Star myths--Myths, savage and civilised,
  of animals, accounting for their marks and habits--Examples of
  custom of claiming blood kinship with lower animals--Myths of
  various plants and trees--Myths of stones, and of metamorphosis
  into stones, Greek, Australian and American--The whole natural
  philosophy of savages expressed in myths, and survives in folk-lore
  and classical poetry; and legends of metamorphosis.

  CHAPTER VI.--NON-ARYAN MYTHS OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD AND OF MAN.

  Confusions of myth--Various origins of man and of things--Myths of
  Australia, Andaman Islands, Bushmen, Ovaherero, Namaquas, Zulus,
  Hurons, Iroquois, Diggers, Navajoes, Winnebagoes, Chaldaeans,
  Thlinkeets, Pacific Islanders, Maoris, Aztecs, Peruvians--
  Similarity of ideas pervading all those peoples in various
  conditions of society and culture.

  CHAPTER VII.--INDO-ARYAN MYTHS--SOURCES OF EVIDENCE.

  Authorities--Vedas--Brahmanas--Social condition of Vedic India--
  Arts--Ranks--War--Vedic fetishism--Ancestor worship--Date of Rig-
  Veda Hymns doubtful--Obscurity of the Hymns--Difficulty of
  interpreting the real character of Veda--Not primitive but
  sacerdotal--The moral purity not innocence but refinement.

  world made out of fragments of a man--Discussion of this hymn--
  Absurdities of Brahmanas--Prajapati, a Vedic Unkulunkulu or Qat--
  Evolutionary myths--Marriage of heaven and earth--Myths of Puranas,
  their savage parallels--Most savage myths are repeated in Brahmanas.

  CHAPTER IX.--GREEK MYTHS OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD AND MAN.

  The Greeks practically civilised when we first meet them in Homer--
  Their mythology, however, is full of repulsive features--The
  hypothesis that many of these are savage survivals--Are there other
  examples of such survival in Greek life and institutions?--Greek
  opinion was constant that the race had been savage--Illustrations
  of savage survival from Greek law of homicide, from magic,
  religion, human sacrifice, religious art, traces of totemism, and
  from the mysteries--Conclusion: that savage survival may also be
  expected in Greek myths.

  CHAPTER X.--GREEK COSMOGONIC MYTHS.

  Nature of the evidence--Traditions of origin of the world and man--
  Homeric, Hesiodic and Orphic myths--Later evidence of historians,
  dramatists, commentators--The Homeric story comparatively pure--The
  story in Hesiod, and its savage analogues--The explanations of the
  myth of Cronus, modern and ancient--The Orphic cosmogony--Phanes

  arguments on this head--The morality of savages.

PREFACE TO NEW IMPRESSION.

When this book first appeared (1886), the philological school of interpretation of religion
and myth, being then still powerful in England, was criticised and opposed by the author. In
Science, as on the Turkish throne of old, "Amurath to Amurath succeeds"; the philological theories
of religion and myth have now yielded to anthropological methods. The centre of the anthropological
position was the "ghost theory" of Mr. Herbert Spencer, the "Animistic" theory of Mr. E. R.
Tylor, according to whom the propitiation of ancestral and other spirits leads to polytheism,
and thence to monotheism. In the second edition (1901) of this work the author argued that
the belief in a "relatively supreme being," anthropomorphic was as old as, and might be even
older, than animistic religion. This theory he exhibited at greater length, and with a larger
collection of evidence, in his Making of Religion.

Since 1901, a great deal of fresh testimony as to what Mr. Howitt styles the "All Father" in
savage and barbaric religions has accrued. As regards this being in Africa, the reader may
consult the volumes of the New Series of the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, which
are full of African evidence, not, as yet, discussed, to my knowledge, by any writer on the
History of Religion. As late as Man, for July, 1906, No. 66, Mr. Parkinson published interesting
Yoruba legends about Oleron, the maker and father of men, and Oro, the Master of the Bull Roarer.

From Australia, we have Mr. Howitt's account of the All Father in his Native Tribes of South-East
Australia, with the account of the All Father of the Central Australian tribe, the Kaitish,
in North Central Tribes of Australia, by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen (1904), also The Euahlayi
Tribe, by Mrs. Langley Parker (1906). These masterly books are indispensable to all students
of the subject, while, in Messrs. Spencer and Gillen's work cited, and in their earlier Native
Tribes of Central Australia, we are introduced to savages who offer an elaborate animistic
theory, and are said to show no traces of the All Father belief.

The books of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen also present much evidence as to a previously unknown
form of totemism, in which the totem is not hereditary, and does not regulate marriage. This
prevails among the Arunta "nation," and the Kaitish tribe. In the opinion of Mr. Spencer (Report
Australian Association for Advancement of Science, 1904) and of Mr. J. G. Frazer (Fortnightly
Review, September, 1905), this is the earliest surviving form of totemism, and Mr. Frazer suggests
an animistic origin for the institution. I have criticised these views in The Secret of the
Totem (1905), and proposed a different solution of the problem. (See also "Primitive and Advanced
Totemism" in Journal of the Anthropological Institute, July, 1906.) In the works mentioned
will be found references to other sources of information as to these questions, which are still
sub judice. Mrs. Bates, who has been studying the hitherto almost unknown tribes of Western
Australia, promises a book on their beliefs and institutions, and Mr. N. W. Thomas is engaged
on a volume on Australian institutions. In this place the author can only direct attention
to these novel sources, and to the promised third edition of Mr. Frazer's The Golden Bough.

PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.

The original edition of Myth, Ritual and Religion, published in 1887, has long been out of
print. In revising the book I have brought it into line with the ideas expressed in the second
part of my Making of Religion (1898) and have excised certain passages which, as the book first
appeared, were inconsistent with its main thesis. In some cases the original passages are retained
in notes, to show the nature of the development of the author's opinions. A fragment or two
of controversy has been deleted, and chapters xi. and xii., on the religion of the lowest races,
have been entirely rewritten, on the strength of more recent or earlier information lately
acquired. The gist of the book as it stands now and as it originally stood is contained in
the following lines from the preface of 1887: "While the attempt is made to show that the wilder
features of myth survive from, or were borrowed from, or were imitated from the ideas of people
in the savage condition of thought, the existence--even among savages--of comparatively pure,
if inarticulate, religious beliefs is insisted on throughout". To that opinion I adhere, and
I trust that it is now expressed with more consistency than in the first edition. I have seen
reason, more and more, to doubt the validity of the "ghost theory," or animistic hypothesis,
as explanatory of the whole fabric of religion; and I present arguments against Mr. Tylor's
contention that the higher conceptions of savage faith are borrowed from missionaries.(1) It
is very possible, however, that Mr. Tylor has arguments more powerful than those contained
in his paper of 1892. For our information is not yet adequate to a scientific theory of the
Origin of Religion, and probably never will be. Behind the races whom we must regard as "nearest
the beginning" are their unknown ancestors from a dateless past, men as human as ourselves,
but men concerning whose psychical, mental and moral condition we can only form conjectures.
Among them religion arose, in circumstances of which we are necessarily ignorant. Thus I only
venture on a surmise as to the germ of a faith in a Maker (if I am not to say "Creator") and
Judge of men. But, as to whether the higher religious belief, or the lower mythical stories
came first, we are at least certain that the Christian conception of God, given pure, was presently
entangled, by the popular fancy of Europe, in new Marchen about the Deity, the Madonna, her
Son, and the Apostles. Here, beyond possibility of denial, pure belief came first, fanciful
legend was attached after. I am inclined to surmise that this has always been the case, and,
in the pages on the legend of Zeus, I show the processes of degeneration, of mythical accretions
on a faith in a Heaven-God, in action. "The improvement of our science" has freed us from misdeeds
which are unknown to the Andamanese or the Australians. Thus there was, as regards these points
in morals, degeneracy from savagery as society advanced, and I believe that there was also
degeneration in religion. To say this is not to hint at a theory of supernatural revelation
to the earliest men, a theory which I must, in limine disclaim.

In vol. ii. p. 19 occurs a reference, in a note, to Mr. Hartland's criticism of my ideas about
Australian gods as set forth in the Making of Religion. Mr. Hartland, who kindly read the chapters
on Australian religion in this book, does not consider that my note on p. 19 meets the point
of his argument. As to the Australians, I mean no more than that, AMONG endless low myths,
some of them possess a belief in a "maker of everything," a primal being, still in existence,
watching conduct, punishing breaches of his laws, and, in some cases, rewarding the good in
a future life. Of course these are the germs of a sympathetic religion, even if the being thus
regarded is mixed up with immoral or humorous contradictory myths. My position is not harmed
by such myths, which occur in all old religions, and, in the middle ages, new myths were attached
to the sacred figures of Christianity in poetry and popular tales.

Thus, if there is nothing "sacred" in a religion because wild or wicked fables about the gods
also occur, there is nothing "sacred" in almost any religion on earth.

Mr. Hartland's point, however, seems to be that, in the Making of Religion, I had selected
certain Australian beliefs as especially "sacred" and to be distinguished from others, because
they are inculcated at the religious Mysteries of some tribes. His aim, then, is to discover
low, wild, immoral myths, inculcated at the Mysteries, and thus to destroy my line drawn between
religion on one hand and myth or mere folk-lore on the other. Thus there is a being named Daramulun,
of whose rites, among the Coast Murring, I condensed the account of Mr. Howitt.(1) From a statement
by Mr. Greenway(2) Mr. Hartland learned that Daramulun's name is said to mean "leg on one side"
or "lame". He, therefore, with fine humour, speaks of Daramulun as "a creator with a game leg,"
though when "Baiame" is derived by two excellent linguists, Mr. Ridley and Mr. Greenway, from
Kamilaroi baia, "to make," Mr. Hartland is by no means so sure of the sense of the name. It
happens to be inconvenient to him! Let the names mean what they may, Mr. Hartland finds, in
an obiter dictum of Mr. Howitt (before he was initiated), that Daramulun is said to have "died,"
and that his spirit is now aloft. Who says so, and where, we are not informed,(3) and the question
is important.

(2) Ibid., xxi. p. 294.

(3) Ibid., xiii. p. 194.

For the Wiraijuri, IN THEIR MYSTERIES, tell a myth of cannibal conduct of Daramulun's, and
of deceit and failure of knowledge in Baiame.(1) Of this I was unaware, or neglected it, for
I explicitly said that I followed Mr. Howitt's account, where no such matter is mentioned.
Mr. Howitt, in fact, described the Mysteries of the Coast Murring, while the narrator of the
low myths, Mr. Matthews, described those of a remote tribe, the Wiraijuri, with whom Daramulun
is not the chief, but a subordinate person. How Mr. Matthews' friends can at once hold that
Daramulun was "destroyed" by Baiame (their chief deity), and also that Daramulun's voice is
heard at their rites, I don't know.(2) Nor do I know why Mr. Hartland takes the myth of a tribe
where Daramulun is "the evil spirit who rules the night,"(3) and introduces it as an argument
against the belief of a distant tribe, where, by Mr. Howitt's account, Daramulun is not an
evil spirit, but "the master" of all, whose abode is above the sky, and to whom are attributed
powers of omnipotence and omnipresence, or, at any rate, the power "to do anything and to go
anywhere.... To his direct ordinances are attributed the social and moral laws of the community."(4)
This is not "an evil spirit"! When Mr. Hartland goes for scandals to a remote tribe of a different
creed that he may discredit the creed of the Coast Murring, he might as well attribute to the
Free Kirk "the errors of Rome". But Mr. Hartland does it!(5) Being "cunning of fence" he may
reply that I also spoke loosely of Wiraijuri and Coast Murring as, indifferently, Daramulunites.
I did, and I was wrong, and my critic ought not to accept but to expose my error. The Wiraijuri
Daramulun, who was annihilated, yet who is "an evil spirit that rules the night," is not the
Murring guardian and founder of recognised ethics.

But, in the Wiraijuri mysteries, the master, Baiame, deceives the women as to the Mysteries!
Shocking to US, but to deceive the women as to these arcana, is, to the Australian mind in
general, necessary for the safety of the world. Moreover, we have heard of a lying spirit sent
to deceive prophets in a much higher creed. Finally, in a myth of the Mystery of the Wiraijuri,
Baiame is not omniscient. Indeed, even civilised races cannot keep on the level of these religious
conceptions, and not to keep on that level is--mythology. Apollo, in the hymn to Hermes, sung
on a sacred occasion, needs to ask an old vine-dresser for intelligence. Hyperion "sees all
and hears all," but needs to be informed, by his daughters, of the slaughter of his kine. The
Lord, in the Book of Job, has to ask Satan, "Whence comest thou?" Now for the sake of dramatic
effect, now from pure inability to live on the level of his highest thought, man mythologises
and anthropomorphises, in Greece or Israel, as in Australia.

It does not follow that there is "nothing sacred" in his religion. Mr. Hartland offers me a
case in point. In Mrs. Langloh Parker's Australian Legendary Tales (pp. 11, 94), are myths
of low adventures of Baiame. In her More Australian Legendary Tales (pp. 84-99), is a very
poetical and charming aspect of the Baiame belief. Mr. Hartland says that I will "seek to put"
the first set of stories out of court, as "a kind of joke with no sacredness about it". Not
I, but the Noongahburrah tribe themselves make this essential distinction. Mrs. Langloh Parker
says:(1) "The former series" (with the low Baiame myths) "were all such legends as are told
to the black picaninnies; among the present are some they would not be allowed to hear, touching
as they do on sacred things, taboo to the young". The blacks draw the line which I am said
to seek to draw.

(1) More Legendary Tales, p. xv.

In yet another case(1) grotesque hunting adventures of Baiame are told in the mysteries, and
illustrated by the sacred temporary representations in raised earth. I did not know it; I merely
followed Mr. Howitt. But I do not doubt it. My reply is, that there was "something sacred"
in Greek mysteries, something purifying, ennobling, consoling. For this Lobeck has collected
(and disparaged) the evidence of Pindar, Sophocles, Cicero and many others, while even Aristophanes,
as Prof. Campbell remarks, says: "We only have bright sun and cheerful life who have been initiated
and lived piously in regard to strangers and to private citizens".(2) Security and peace of
mind, in this world and for the next, were, we know not how, borne into the hearts of Pindar
and Sophocles in the Mysteries. Yet, if we may at all trust the Fathers, there were scenes
of debauchery, as at the Mysteries of the Fijians (Nanga) there was buffoonery ("to amuse the
boys," Mr. Howitt says of some Australian rites), the story of Baubo is only one example, and,
in other mysteries than the Eleusinian, we know of mummeries in which an absurd tale of Zeus
is related in connection with an oak log. Yet surely there was "something sacred" in the faith
of Zeus! Let us judge the Australians as we judge Greeks. The precepts as to "speaking the
straightforward truth," as to unselfishness, avoidance of quarrels, of wrongs to "unprotected
women," of unnatural vices, are certainly communicated in the Mysteries of some tribes, with,
in another, knowledge of the name and nature of "Our Father," Munganngaur. That a Totemistic
dance, or medicine-dance of Emu hunting, is also displayed(3) at certain Mysteries of a given
tribe, and that Baiame is spoken of as the hero of this ballet, no more deprives the Australian
moral and religious teaching (at the Mysteries) of sacred value, than the stupid indecency
whereby Baubo made Demeter laugh destroys the sacredness of the Eleusinia, on which Pindar,
Sophocles and Cicero eloquently dwell. If the Australian mystae, at the most solemn moment
of their lives, are shown a dull or dirty divine ballet d'action, what did Sophocles see, after
taking a swim with his pig? Many things far from edifying, yet the sacred element of religious
hope and faith was also represented. So it is in Australia.

These studies ought to be comparative, otherwise they are worthless. As Mr. Hartland calls
Daramulun "an eternal Creator with a game leg" who "died," he may call Zeus an "eternal father,
who swallowed his wife, lay with his mother and sister, made love as a swan, and died, nay,
was buried, in Crete". I do not think that Mr. Hartland would call Zeus "a ghost-god" (my own
phrase), or think that he was scoring a point against me, if I spoke of the sacred and ethical
characteristics of the Zeus adored by Eumaeus in the Odyssey. He would not be so humorous about
Zeus, nor fall into an ignoratio elenchi. For my point never was that any Australian tribe
had a pure theistic conception unsoiled and unobliterated by myth and buffoonery. My argument
was that AMONG their ideas is that of a superhuman being, unceasing (if I may not say eternal),
a maker (if I may not say a Creator), a guardian of certain by no means despicable ethics,
which I never proclaimed as supernormally inspired! It is no reply to me to say that, in or
out of Mysteries, low fables about that being are told, and buffooneries are enacted. For,
though I say that certain high ideas are taught in Mysteries, I do not think I say that in
Mysteries no low myths are told.

I take this opportunity, as the earliest, to apologise for an error in my Making of Religion
concerning a passage in the Primitive Culture of my friend Mr. E. B. Tylor. Mr. Tylor quoted(1)
a passage from Captain John Smith's History of Virginia, as given in Pinkerton, xiii. pp. 13-39,
1632. In this passage no mention occurs of a Virginian deity named Ahone but "Okee," another
and more truculent god, is named. I observed that, if Mr. Tylor had used Strachey's Historie
of Travaile (1612), he would have found "a slightly varying copy" of Smith's text of 1632,
with Ahone as superior to Okee. Here, as presently will be shown, I erred, in company with
Strachey's editor of 1849, and with the writer on Strachey in the Dictionary of National Biography.
What Mr. Tylor quoted from an edition of Smith in 1632 had already appeared, in 1612, in a
book (Map of Virginia, with a description of the Countrey) described on the title-page as "written
by Captain Smith," though, in my opinion, Smith may have had a collaborator. There is no evidence
whatever that Strachey had anything to do with this book of 1612, in which there is no mention
of Ahone. Mr. Arber dates Strachey's own MS. (in which Ahone occurs) as of 1610-1615.(2) I
myself, for reasons presently to be alleged, date the MS. mainly in 1611-1612. If Mr. Arber
and I are right, Strachey must have had access to Smith's MS. before it was published in 1612,
and we shall see how he used it. My point here is that Strachey mentioned Ahone (in MS.) before
Smith's book of 1612 was published. This could not be gathered from the dedication to Bacon
prefixed to Strachey's MS., for that dedication cannot be earlier that 1618.(3) I now ask leave
to discuss the evidence for an early pre-Christian belief in a primal Creator, held by the
Indian tribes from Plymouth, in New England, to Roanoke Island, off Southern Virginia.

THE GOD AHONE.

An insertion by a manifest plagiary into the work of a detected liar is not, usually, good
evidence. Yet this is all the evidence, it may be urged, which we have for the existence of
a belief, in early Virginia, as to a good Creator, named Ahone. The matter stands thus: In
1607-1609 the famed Captain John Smith endured and achieved in Virginia sufferings and adventures.
In 1608 he sent to the Council at home a MS. map and description of the colony. In 1609 he
returned to England (October). In May, 1610, William Strachey, gent., arrived in Virginia,
where he was "secretary of state" to Lord De la Warr. In 1612 Strachey and Smith were both
in England. In that year Barnes of Oxford published A Map of Virginia, with a description,
etc., "written by Captain Smith," according to the title-page. There was annexed a compilation
from various sources, edited by "W. S.," that is, NOT William Strachey, but Dr. William Symonds.
In the same year, 1612, or in 1611, William Strachey wrote his Historie of Travaile into Virginia
Britannia, at least as far as page 124 of the Hakluyt edition of 1849.(1)

(1) For proof see p. 24. third line from foot of page, where 1612 is indicated. Again, see
p. 98, line 5, where "last year" is dated as "1610, about Christmas," which would put Strachey's
work at this point as actually of 1611; prior, that is, to Smith's publication. Again, p. 124,
"this last year, myself being at the Falls" (of the James River), "I found in an Indian house
certain clawes... which I brought away and into England".

If Strachey, who went out with Lord De la Warr as secretary in 1610, returned with him (as
is likely), he sailed for England on 28th March, 1611. In that case, he was in England in 1611,
and the passages cited leave it dubious whether he wrote his book in 1611, 1612, or in both
years.(1)

(1) Mr. Arber dates the MS. "1610-1615," and attributes to Strachey Laws for Virginia, 1612.

Strachey embodies in his work considerable pieces of Smith's Map of Virginia and Description,
written in 1608, and published in 1612. He continually deserts Smith, however, adding more
recent information, reflections and references to the ancient classics, with allusions to his
own travels in the Levant. His glossary is much more extensive than Smith's, and he inserts
a native song of triumph over the English in the original.(1) Now, when Strachey comes to the
religion of the natives(2) he gives eighteen pages (much of it verbiage) to five of Smith's.(3)
What Smith (1612) says of their chief god I quote, setting Strachey's version (1611-1612) beside
it.

SMITH (Published, 1612).

But their chiefe God they worship is the Diuell. Him they call Oke, and serue him more of feare
than loue. They say they have conference with him, and fashion themselues as near to his shape
as they can imagine. In their Temples, they have his image euile favouredly carved, and then
painted, and adorned with chaines, copper, and beades; and covered with a skin, in such manner
as the deformity may well suit with such a God. By him is commonly the sepulcher of their Kings.

STRACHEY (Written, 1611-12).

But their chief god they worship is no other, indeed, then the divell, whome they make presentments
of, and shadow under the forme of an idoll, which they entitle Okeus, and whome they worship
as the Romans did their hurtful god Vejovis, more for feare of harme then for hope of any good;
they saie they have conference with him, and fashion themselves in their disguisments as neere
to his shape as they can imagyn. In every territory of a weroance is a temple and a priest,
peradventure two or thrie; yet happie doth that weroance accompt himself who can detayne with
him a Quiyough-quisock, of the best, grave, lucky, well instructed in their misteryes, and
beloved of their god; and such a one is noe lesse honoured then was Dianae's priest at Ephesus,
for whome they have their more private temples, with oratories and chauneells therein, according
as is the dignity and reverence of the Quiyough-quisock, which the weroance wilbe at charge
to build upon purpose, sometyme twenty foote broad and a hundred in length, fashioned arbour
wyse after their buylding, having comonly the dore opening into the east, and at the west end
a spence or chauncell from the body of the temple, with hollow wyndings and pillers, whereon
stand divers black imagies, fashioned to the shoulders, with their faces looking down the church,
and where within their weroances, upon a kind of biere of reedes, lye buryed; and under them,
apart, in a vault low in the ground (as a more secrett thing), vailed with a matt, sitts their
Okeus, an image ill-favouredly carved, all black dressed, with chaynes of perle, the presentment
and figure of that god (say the priests unto the laity, and who religiously believe what the
priests saie) which doth them all the harme they suffer, be yt in their bodies or goods, within
doores or abroad; and true yt is many of them are divers tymes (especyally offendors) shrewdly
scratched as they walke alone in the woods, yt may well be by the subtyle spirit, the malitious
enemy to mankind, whome, therefore, to pacefie and worke to doe them good (at least no harme)
the priests tell them they must do these and these sacrifices unto (them) of these and these
things, and thus and thus often, by which meanes not only their owne children, but straungers,
are sometimes sacrificed unto him: whilst the great god (the priests tell them) who governes
all the world, and makes the sun to shine, creating the moone and stars his companyons, great
powers, and which dwell with him, and by whose virtues and influences the under earth is tempered,
and brings forth her fruiets according to her seasons, they calling Ahone; the good and peaceable
god requires no such dutyes, nor needes be sacrificed unto, for he intendeth all good unto
them, and will doe noe harme, only the displeased Okeus, looking into all men's accions, and
examining the same according to the severe scale of justice, punisheth them with sicknesse,
beats them, and strikes their ripe corn with blastings, stormes, and thunder clapps, stirrs
up warre, and makes their women falce unto them. Such is the misery and thraldome under which
Sathan hath bound these wretched miscreants.

I began by calling Strachey a plagiary. The reader will now observe that he gives far more
than he takes. For example, his account of the temples is much more full than that of Smith,
and he adds to Smith's version the character and being of Ahone, as what "the priests tell
them". I submit, therefore, that Strachey's additions, if valid for temples, are not discredited
for Ahone, merely because they are inserted in the framework of Smith. As far as I understand
the matter, Smith's Map of Virginia (1612) is an amended copy, with additions, by Smith or
another writer of that description, which he sent home to the Council of Virginia, in November,
1608.(1) To the book of 1612 was added a portion of "Relations" by different hands, edited
by W. S., namely, Dr. Symonds. Strachey's editor, in 1849, regarded W. S. as Strachey, and
supposed that Strachey was the real author of Smith's Map of Virginia, so that, in his Historie
of Travaile, Strachey merely took back his own. He did not take back his own; he made use of
Smith's MS., not yet published, if Mr. Arber and I rightly date Strachey's MS. at 1610-15,
or 1611-12. Why Strachey acted thus it is possible to conjecture. As a scholar well acquainted
with Virginia, and as Secretary for the Colony, he would have access to Smith's MS. of 1608
among the papers of the Council, before its publication. Smith professes himself "no scholer".(2)
On the other hand, Strachey likes to show off his Latin and Greek. He has a curious, if inaccurate,
knowledge of esoteric Greek and Roman religious antiquities, and in writing of religion aims
at a comparative method. Strachey, however, took the trouble to copy bits of Smith into his
own larger work, which he never gave to the printers.

(1) Arber, p. 444.

(2) Arber, p. 442.

Now as to Ahone. It suits my argument to suppose that Strachey's account is no less genuine
than his description of the temples (illustrated by a picture by John White, who had been in
Virginia in 1589), and the account of the Great Hare of American mythology.(1) This view of
a Virginian Creator, "our chief god" "who takes upon him this shape of a hare," was got, says
Strachey, "last year, 1610," from a brother of the Potomac King, by a boy named Spilman, who
says that Smith "sold" him to Powhattan.(2) In his own brief narrative Spelman (or Spilman)
says nothing about the Cosmogonic Legend of the Great Hare. The story came up when Captain
Argoll was telling Powhattan's brother the account of creation in Genesis (1610).

(1) Strachey, p. 98-100.

(2) "Spilman's Narrative," Arber, cx.-cxiv.

Now Strachey's Great Hare is accepted by mythologists, while Ahone is regarded with suspicion.
Ahone does not happen to suit anthropological ideas, the Hare suits them rather better. Moreover,
and more important, there is abundant corroborative evidence for Oke and for the Hare, Michabo,
who, says Dr. Brinton, "was originally the highest divinity recognised by them, powerful and
beneficent beyond all others, maker of the heavens and the world," just like Ahone, in fact.
And Dr. Brinton instructs us that Michabo originally meant not Great Hare, but "the spirit
of light".(1) Thus, originally, the Red Men adored "The Spirit of Light, maker of the heavens
and the world". Strachey claims no more than this for Ahone. Now, of course, Dr. Brinton may
be right. But I have already expressed my extreme distrust of the philological processes by
which he extracts "The Great Light; spirit of light," from Michabo, "beyond a doubt!" In my
poor opinion, whatever claims Michabo may have as an unique creator of earth and heaven--"God
is Light,"--he owes his mythical aspect as a Hare to something other than an unconscious pun.
In any case, according to Dr. Brinton, Michabo, regarded as a creator, is equivalent to Strachey's
Ahone. This amount of corroboration, valeat quantum, I may claim, from the Potomac Indians,
for the belief in Ahone on the James River. Dr. Brinton is notoriously not a believer in American
"monotheism".(2)

(1) Myths of the New World, p. 178.

(2) Myths of the New World, p. 53.

The opponents of the authenticity of Ahone, however, will certainly argue: "For Oke, or Oki,
as a redoubted being or spirit, or general name for such personages, we have plentiful evidence,
corroborating that of Smith. But what evidence as to Ahone corroborates that of Strachey?"
I must confess that I have no explicit corroborative evidence for Ahone, but then I have no
accessible library of early books on Virginia. Now it is clear that if I found and produced
evidence for Ahone as late as 1625, I would be met at once with the retort that, between 1610
and 1625, Christian ideas had contaminated the native beliefs. Thus if I find Ahone, or a deity
of like attributes, after a very early date, he is of no use for my purpose. Nor do I much
expect to find him. But do we find Winslow's Massachusetts God, Kiehtan, named AFTER 1622 ("I
only ask for information"), and if we don't, does that prevent Mr. Tylor from citing Kiehtan,
with apparent reliance on the evidence?(1)

(1) Primitive Culture, ii. p. 342.

Again, Ahone, though primal and creative, is, by Strachey's account, a sleeping partner. He
has no sacrifice, and no temple or idol is recorded. Therefore the belief in Ahone could only
be discovered as a result of inquiry, whereas figures of Oke or Okeus, and his services, were
common and conspicuous.(1) As to Oke, I cannot quite understand Mr. Tylor's attitude. Summarising
Lafitau, a late writer of 1724, Mr. Tylor writes: "The whole class of spirits or demons, known
to the Caribs by the name of cemi, in Algonkin as manitu, in Huron as oki, Lafitau now spells
with capital letters, and converts them each into a supreme being".(2) Yet in Primitive Culture,
ii., 342, 1891, Mr. Tylor had cited Smith's Okee (with a capital letter) as the "chief god"
of the Virginians in 1612. Smith, rebuked for the same by Mr. Tylor, had even identified Okee
with the devil. Lafitau certainly did not begin this erroneous view of Oki as a "chief god"
among the Virginians. If I cannot to-day produce corroboration for a god named Ahone, I can
at least show that, from the north of New England to the south of Virginia, there is early
evidence, cited by Mr. Tylor, for a belief in a primal creative being, closely analogous to
Ahone. And this evidence, I think, distinctly proves that such a being as Ahone was within
the capacity of the Indians in these latitudes. Mr. Tylor must have thought in 1891 that the
natives were competent to a belief in a supreme deity, for he said, "Another famous native
American name for the supreme deity is Oki".(3) In the essay of 1892, however, Oki does not
appear to exist as a god's name till 1724. We may now, for earlier evidence, turn to Master
Thomas Heriot, "that learned mathematician" "who spoke the Indian language," and was with the
company which abandoned Virginia on 18th June, 1586. They ranged 130 miles north and 130 miles
north-west of Roanoke Island, which brings them into the neighbourhood of Smith's and Strachey's
country. Heriot writes as to the native creeds: "They believe that there are many gods which
they call Mantoac, but of different sorts and degrees. An idol, or image, "Kewasa" (the plural
is "Kewasowok"), is placed in the temples, "where they worship, pray and make many offerings".
Good souls go to be happy with the gods, the bad burn in Popogusso, a great pit, "where the
sun sets". The evidence for this theory of a future life, as usual, is that of men who died
and revived again, a story found in a score of widely separated regions, down to our day, when
the death, revival and revelation occurred to the founder of the Arapahoe new religion of the
Ghost Dance. The belief "works for righteousness". "The common sort... have great care to avoyde
torment after death, and to enjoy blesse," also they have "great respect to their Governors".

(1) Okee's image, as early as 1607, was borne into battle against Smith, who captured the god
(Arber, p. 393). Ahone was not thus en evidence.

(2) Journal of Anthrop. Inst., Feb., 1892, pp. 285, 286.

(3) Prim. Cult,, ii. p. 342.

This belief in a chief god "from all eternitie" (that is, of unexplained origin), may not be
convenient to some speculators, but it exactly corroborates Strachey's account of Ahone as
creator with subordinates. The evidence is of 1586 (twenty-six years before Strachey), and,
like Strachey, Heriot attributes the whole scheme of belief to "the priestes". "This is the
sum of their religion, which I learned by having speciall familiaritie with some of their priests."(1)
I see no escape from the conclusion that the Virginians believed as Heriot says they did, except
the device of alleging that they promptly borrowed some of Heriot's ideas and maintained that
these ideas had ever been their own. Heriot certainly did not recognise the identity. "Through
conversing with us they were brought into great doubts of their owne (religion), and no small
admiration of ours; of which many desired to learne more than we had the meanes for want of
utterance in their language to expresse." So Heriot could not be subtle in the native tongue.
Heriot did what he could to convert them: "I did my best to make His immortall glory knowne".
His efforts were chiefly successful by virtue of the savage admiration of our guns, mathematical
instruments, and so forth. These sources of an awakened interest in Christianity would vanish
with the total destruction and discomfiture of the colony, unless a few captives, later massacred,
taught our religion to the natives.(2)

(1) According to Strachey, Heriot could speak the native language.

(2) Heriot's Narrative, pp. 37-39. Quaritch, London, 1893.

I shall cite another early example of a New England deity akin to Ahone, with a deputy, a friend
of sorcerers, like Okee. This account is in Smith's General History of New England, 1606-1624.
We sent out a colony in 1607; "they all returned in the yeere 1608," esteeming the country
"a cold, barren, mountainous rocky desart". I am apt to believe that they did not plant the
fructifying seeds of grace among the natives in 1607-1608. But the missionary efforts of French
traders may, of course, have been blessed; nor can I deny that a yellow-haired man, whose corpse
was found in 1620 with some objects of iron, may have converted the natives to such beliefs
as they possessed. We are told, however, that these tenets were of ancestral antiquity. I cite
E. Winslow, as edited by Smith (1623-24):--

"Those where in this Plantation (New Plymouth) say Kiehtan(1) made all the other Gods: also
one man and one woman, and with them all mankinde, but how they became so dispersed they know
not. They say that at first there was no king but Kiehtan, that dwelleth far westerly above
the heavens, whither all good men go when they die, and have plentie of all things. The bad
go thither also and knock at the door, but ('the door is shut') he bids them go wander in endless
want and misery, for they shall not stay there. They never saw Kiehtan,(2) but they hold it
a great charge and dutie that one race teach another; and to him they make feasts and cry and
sing for plenty and victory, or anything that is good.

(1) In 1873 Mr. Tylor regarded Dr. Brinton's etymology of Kiehtan as = Kittanitowit = "Great
Living Spirit," as "plausible". In his edition of 1891 he omits this etymology. Personally
I entirely distrust the philological theories of the original sense of old divine names as
a general rule.

(2) "They never saw Kiehtan." So, about 1854, "The common answer of intelligent black fellows
on the Barwon when asked if they know Baiame... is this: 'Kamil zaia zummi Baiame, zaia winuzgulda';
'I have not seen Baiame, I have heard or perceived him'. If asked who made the sky, the earth,
the animals and man, they always answer 'Baiame'." Daramulun, according to the same authority
in Lang's Queensland, was the familiar of sorcerers, and appeared as a serpent. This answers,
as I show, to Hobamock the subordinate power to Kiehtan in New England and to Okee, the familiar
of sorcerers in Virginia. (Ridley, J. A. I., 1872, p. 277.)

"They have another Power they call Hobamock, which we conceive the Devill, and upon him they
call to cure their wounds and diseases; when they are curable he persuades them he sent them,
because they have displeased him; but, if they be mortal, then he saith, 'Kiehtan sent them';
which makes them never call on him in their sickness. They say this Hobamock appears to them
sometimes like a man, a deer, or an eagle, but most commonly like a snake; not to all but to
their Powahs to cure diseases, and Undeses... and these are such as conjure in Virginia, and
cause the people to do what they list." Winslow (or rather Smith editing Winslow here), had
already said, "They believe, as do the Virginians, of many divine powers, yet of one above
all the rest, as the Southern Virginians call their chief god Kewassa (an error), and that
we now inhabit Oke.... The Massachusetts call their great god Kiehtan."(1)

(1) Arber, pp. 767, 768.

Here, then, in Heriot (1586), Strachey (1611-12) and Winslow (1622), we find fairly harmonious
accounts of a polydaemonism with a chief, primal, creative being above and behind it; a being
unnamed, and Ahone and Kiehtan.

Is all this invention? Or was all this derived from Europeans before 1586, and, if so, from
what Europeans? Mr. Tylor, in 1873, wrote, "After due allowance made for misrendering of savage
answers, and importation of white men's thoughts, it can hardly be judged that a divine being,
whose characteristics are often so unlike what European intercourse would have suggested, and
who is heard of by such early explorers among such distant tribes, could be a deity of foreign
origin". NOW, he "can HARDLY be ALTOGETHER a deity of foreign origin".(1) I agree with Mr.
Tylor's earlier statement. In my opinion Ahone--Okeus, Kiehtan--Hobamock, correspond, the first
pair to the usually unseen Australian Baiame (a crystal or hypnotic vision of Baiame scarcely
counts), while the second pair, Okeus and Hobamock, answer to the Australian familiars of sorcerers,
Koin and Brewin; the American "Powers" being those of peoples on a higher level of culture.
Like Tharramulun where Baiame is supreme, Hobamock appears as a snake (Asclepius).

(1) Prim. Cult., ii. 340, 1873, 1892.

For all these reasons I am inclined to accept Strachey's Ahone as a veritable element in Virginian
belief. Without temple or service, such a being was not conspicuous, like Okee and other gods
which had idols and sacrifices.

As far as I see, Strachey has no theory to serve by inventing Ahone. He asks how any races
"if descended from the people of the first creation, should maintain so general and gross a
defection from the true knowledge of God". He is reduced to suppose that, as descendants of
Ham, they inherit "the ignorance of true godliness." (p. 45). The children of Shem and Japheth
alone "retained, until the coming of the Messias, the only knowledge of the eternal and never-changing
Trinity". The Virginians, on the other hand, fell heir to the ignorance, and "fearful and superstitious
instinct of nature" of Ham (p. 40). Ahone, therefore, is not invented by Strachey to bolster
up a theory (held by Strachey), of an inherited revelation, or of a sensus numinis which could
not go wrong. Unless a proof be given that Strachey had a theory, or any other purpose, to
serve by inventing Ahone, I cannot at present come into the opinion that he gratuitously fabled,
though he may have unconsciously exaggerated.

What were Strachey's sources? He was for nine months, if not more, in the colony: he had travelled
at least 115 miles up the James River, he occasionally suggests modifications of Smith's map,
he refers to Smith's adventures, and his glossary is very much larger than Smith's; its accuracy
I leave to American linguists. Such a witness, despite his admitted use of Smith's text (if
it is really all by Smith throughout) is not to be despised, and he is not despised in America.(1)
Strachey, it is true, had not, like Smith, been captured by Indians and either treated with
perfect kindness and consideration (as Smith reported at the time), or tied to a tree and threatened
with arrows, and laid out to have his head knocked in with a stone; as he alleged sixteen years
later! Strachey, not being captured, did not owe his release (1) to the magnanimity of Powhattan,
(2) to his own ingenious lies, (3) to the intercession of Pocahontas, as Smith, and his friends
for him, at various dates inconsistently declared. Smith certainly saw more of the natives
at home: Strachey brought a more studious mind to what he could learn of their customs and
ideas; and is not a convicted braggart. I conjecture that one of Strachey's sources was a native
named Kemps. Smith had seized Kemps and Kinsock in 1609. Unknown authorities (Powell? and Todkill?)
represent these two savages as "the most exact villaines in the country".(2) They were made
to labour in fetters, then were set at liberty, but "little desired it".(3) Some "souldiers"
ran away to the liberated Kemps, who brought them back to Smith.(4) Why Kemps and his friend
are called "two of the most exact villains in the country" does not appear. Kemps died "of
the surveye" (scurvey, probably) at Jamestown, in 1610-11. He was much made of by Lord De la
Warr, "could speak a pretty deal of our English, and came orderly to church every day to prayers".
He gave Strachey the names of Powhattan's wives, and told him, truly or not, that Pocahontas
was married, about 1610, to an Indian named Kocoum.(5) I offer the guess that Kemps and Machumps,
who came and went from Pocahontas, and recited an Indian prayer which Strachey neglected to
copy out, may have been among Strachey's authorities. I shall, of course, be told that Kemps
picked up Ahone at church. This did not strike Strachey as being the fact; he had no opinion
of the creed in which Ahone was a factor, "the misery and thraldome under which Sathan has
bound these wretched miscreants". According to Strachey, the priests, far from borrowing any
part of our faith, "feare and tremble lest the knowledge of God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ
be taught in these parts".

(1) Arber, cxvii. Strachey mentions that (before his arrival in Virginia) Pocahontas turned
cart-wheels, naked, in Jamestown, being then under twelve, and not yet wearing the apron. Smith
says she was ten in 1608, but does not mention the cart-wheels. Later, he found it convenient
to put her age at twelve or thirteen in 1608. Most American scholars, such as Mr. Adams, entirely
distrust the romantic later narratives of Smith.

(2) The Proeeedings, etc., by W. S. Arber, p. 151.

(3) Ibid., p. 155.

(4) Ibid., p. 157.

(5) Strachey, pp. 54, 55.

Strachey is therefore for putting down the priests, and, like Smith (indeed here borrowing
from Smith), accuses them of sacrificing children. To Smith's statement that such a rite was
worked at Quiyough-cohanock, Strachey adds that Sir George Percy (who was with Smith) "was
at, and observed" a similar mystery at Kecoughtan. It is plain that the rite was not a sacrifice,
but a Bora, or initiation, and the parallel of the Spartan flogging of boys, with the retreat
of the boys and their instructors, is very close, and, of course, unnoted by classical scholars
except Mr. Frazer. Strachey ends with the critical remark that we shall not know all the certainty
of the religion and mysteries till we can capture some of the priests, or Quiyough-quisocks.

Students who have access to a good library of Americana may do more to elucidate Ahone. I regard
him as in a line with Kiehtan and the God spoken of by Heriot, and do not believe (1) that
Strachey lied; (2) that natives deceived Strachey; (3) that Ahone was borrowed from "the God
of Captain Smith".

MYTH, RITUAL, AND RELIGION.

The word "Religion" may be, and has been, employed in many different senses, and with a perplexing
width of significance. No attempt to define the word is likely to be quite satisfactory, but
almost any definition may serve the purpose of an argument, if the writer who employs it states
his meaning frankly and adheres to it steadily. An example of the confusions which may arise
from the use of the term "religion" is familiar to students. Dr. J. D. Lang wrote concerning
the native races of Australia: "They have nothing whatever of the character of religion, or
of religious observances, to distinguish them from the beasts that perish". Yet in the same
book Dr. Lang published evidence assigning to the natives belief in "Turramullun, the chief
of demons, who is the author of disease, mischief and wisdom".(1) The belief in a superhuman
author of "disease, mischief and wisdom" is certainly a religious belief not conspicuously
held by "the beasts"; yet all religion was denied to the Australians by the very author who
prints (in however erroneous a style) an account of part of their creed. This writer merely
inherited the old missionary habit of speaking about the god of a non-Christian people as a
"demon" or an "evil spirit".

(1) See Primitive Culture, second edition, i. 419.

Dr. Lang's negative opinion was contradicted in testimony published by himself, an appendix
by the Rev. Mr. Ridley, containing evidence of the belief in Baiame. "Those who have learned
that 'God' is the name by which we speak of the Creator, say that Baiame is God."(1)

(1) Lang's Queensland, p. 445, 1861.

As "a minimum definition of religion," Mr. Tylor has suggested "the belief in spiritual beings".
Against this it may be urged that, while we have no definite certainty that any race of men
is destitute of belief in spiritual beings, yet certain moral and creative deities of low races
do not seem to be envisaged as "spiritual" at all. They are regarded as EXISTENCES, as BEINGS,
unconditioned by Time, Space, or Death, and nobody appears to have put the purely metaphysical
question, "Are these beings spiritual or material?"(1) Now, if a race were discovered which
believed in such beings, yet had no faith in spirits, that race could not be called irreligious,
as it would have to be called in Mr. Tylor's "minimum definition". Almost certainly, no race
in this stage of belief in nothing but unconditioned but not expressly spiritual beings is
extant. Yet such a belief may conceivably have existed before men had developed the theory
of spirits at all, and such a belief, in creative and moral unconditioned beings, not alleged
to be spiritual, could not be excluded from a definition of religion.(2)

(1) See The Making of Religion, pp. 201-210.

(2) "The history of the Jews, nay, the history of our own mind, proves to demonstration that
the thought of God is a far easier thought, and a far earlier, than that of a spirit." Father
Tyrrell, S. J., The Month, October, 1898. As to the Jews, the question is debated. As to our
own infancy, we are certainly taught about God before we are likely to be capable of the metaphysical
notion of spirit. But we can scarcely reason from children in Christian houses to the infancy
of the race.

For these reasons we propose (merely for the purpose of the present work) to define religion
as the belief in a primal being, a Maker, undying, usually moral, without denying that the
belief in spiritual beings, even if immoral, may be styled religious. Our definition is expressly
framed for the purpose of the argument, because that argument endeavours to bring into view
the essential conflict between religion and myth. We intend to show that this conflict between
the religious and the mythical conception is present, not only (where it has been universally
recognised) in the faiths of the ancient civilised peoples, as in Greece, Rome, India and Egypt,
but also in the ideas of the lowest known savages.

It may, of course, be argued that the belief in Creator is itself a myth. However that may
be, the attitude of awe, and of moral obedience, in face of such a supposed being, is religious
in the sense of the Christian religion, whereas the fabrication of fanciful, humorous, and
wildly irrational fables about that being, or others, is essentially mythical in the ordinary
significance of that word, though not absent from popular Christianity.

Now, the whole crux and puzzle of mythology is, "Why, having attained (in whatever way) to
a belief in an undying guardian, 'Master of Life,' did mankind set to work to evolve a chronique
scandaleuse about HIM? And why is that chronique the elaborately absurd set of legends which
we find in all mythologies?"

In answering, or trying to answer, these questions, we cannot go behind the beliefs of the
races now most immersed in savage ignorance. About the psychology of races yet more undeveloped
we can have no historical knowledge. Among the lowest known tribes we usually find, just as
in ancient Greece, the belief in a deathless "Father," "Master," "Maker," and also the crowd
of humorous, obscene, fanciful myths which are in flagrant contradiction with the religious
character of that belief. That belief is what we call rational, and even elevated. The myths,
on the other hand, are what we call irrational and debasing. We regard low savages as very
irrational and debased characters, consequently the nature of their myths does not surprise
us. Their religious conception, however, of a "Father" or "Master of Life" seems out of keeping
with the nature of the savage mind as we understand it. Still, there the religious conception
actually is, and it seems to follow that we do not wholly understand the savage mind, or its
unknown antecedents. In any case, there the facts are, as shall be demonstrated. However the
ancestors of Australians, or Andamanese, or Hurons arrived at their highest religious conception,
they decidedly possess it.(1) The development of their mythical conceptions is accounted for
by those qualities of their minds which we do understand, and shall illustrate at length. For
the present, we can only say that the religious conception uprises from the human intellect
in one mood, that of earnest contemplation and submission: while the mythical ideas uprise
from another mood, that of playful and erratic fancy. These two moods are conspicuous even
in Christianity. The former, that of earnest and submissive contemplation, declares itself
in prayers, hymns, and "the dim religious light" of cathedrals. The second mood, that of playful
and erratic fancy, is conspicuous in the buffoonery of Miracle Plays, in Marchen, these burlesque
popular tales about our Lord and the Apostles, and in the hideous and grotesque sculptures
on sacred edifices. The two moods are present, and in conflict, through the whole religious
history of the human race. They stand as near each other, and as far apart, as Love and Lust.

(1) The hypothesis that the conception was borrowed from European creeds will be discussed
later. See, too, "Are Savage Gods borrowed from Missionaries?" Nineteenth Century, January, 1899.

It will later be shown that even some of the most backward savages make a perhaps half-conscious
distinction between their mythology and their religion. As to the former, they are communicative;
as to the latter, they jealously guard their secret in sacred mysteries. It is improbable that
reflective "black fellows" have been morally shocked by the flagrant contradictions between
their religious conceptions and their mythical stories of the divine beings. But human thought
could not come into explicit clearness of consciousness without producing the sense of shock
and surprise at these contradictions between the Religion and the Myth of the same god. Of
this we proceed to give examples.

In Greece, as early as the sixth century B. C., we are all familiar with Xenophanes' poem(1)
complaining that the gods were credited with the worst crimes of mortals--in fact, with abominations
only known in the orgies of Nero and Elagabalus. We hear Pindar refusing to repeat the tale
which told him the blessed were cannibals.(2) In India we read the pious Brahmanic attempts
to expound decently the myths which made Indra the slayer of a Brahman; the sinner, that is,
of the unpardonable sin. In Egypt, too, we study the priestly or philosophic systems by which
the clergy strove to strip the burden of absurdity and sacrilege from their own deities. From
all these efforts of civilised and pious believers to explain away the stories about their
own gods we may infer one fact--the most important to the student of mythology--the fact that
myths were not evolved in times of clear civilised thought. It is when Greece is just beginning
to free her thought from the bondage of too concrete language, when she is striving to coin
abstract terms, that her philosophers and poets first find the myths of Greece a stumbling-block.

(1) Ritter and Preller, Hist. Philos., Gothae, 1869, p. 82.

(2) Olympic Odes, i., Myers's translation: "To me it is impossible to call one of the blessed
gods a cannibal.... Meet it is for a man that concerning the gods he speak honourably, for
the reproach is less. Of thee, son of Tantalus, I will speak contrariwise to them who have
gone before me." In avoiding the story of the cannibal god, however, Pindar tells a tale even
more offensive to our morality.

All early attempts at an interpretation of mythology are so many efforts to explain the myths
on some principle which shall seem not unreasonable to men living at the time of the explanation.
Therefore the pious remonstrances and the forced constructions of early thinkers like Xenophanes,
of poets like Pindar, of all ancient Homeric scholars and Pagan apologists, from Theagenes
of Rhegium (525 B. C.), the early Homeric commentator, to Porphyry, almost the last of the
heathen philosophers, are so many proofs that to Greece, as soon as she had a reflective literature,
the myths of Greece seemed impious and IRRATIONAL. The essays of the native commentators on
the Veda, in the same way, are endeavours to put into myths felt to be irrational and impious
a meaning which does not offend either piety or reason. We may therefore conclude that it was
not men in an early stage of philosophic thought (as philosophy is now understood)--not men
like Empedocles and Heraclitus, nor reasonably devout men like Eumaeus, the pious swineherd
of the Odyssey--who evolved the blasphemous myths of Greece, of Egypt and of India. We must
look elsewhere for an explanation. We must try to discover some actual and demonstrable and
widely prevalent condition of the human mind, in which tales that even to remote and rudimentary
civilisations appeared irrational and unnatural would seem natural and rational. To discover
this intellectual condition has been the aim of all mythologists who did not believe that myth
is a divine tradition depraved by human weakness, or a distorted version of historical events.

Before going further, it is desirable to set forth what our aim is, and to what extent we are
seeking an interpretation of mythology. It is not our purpose to explain every detail of every
ancient legend, either as a distorted historical fact or as the result of this or that confusion
of thought caused by forgetfulness of the meanings of language, or in any other way; nay, we
must constantly protest against the excursions of too venturesome ingenuity. Myth is so ancient,
so complex, so full of elements, that it is vain labour to seek a cause for every phenomenon.
We are chiefly occupied with the quest for an historical condition of the human intellect to
which the element in myths, regarded by us as irrational, shall seem rational enough. If we
can prove that such a state of mind widely exists among men, and has existed, that state of
mind may be provisionally considered as the fount and ORIGIN of the myths which have always
perplexed men in a reasonable modern mental condition. Again, if it can be shown that this
mental stage was one through which all civilised races have passed, the universality of the
mythopoeic mental condition will to some extent explain the universal DIFFUSION of the stories.

Now, in all mythologies, whether savage or civilised, and in all religions where myths intrude,
there exist two factors--the factor which we now regard as rational, and that which we moderns
regard as irrational. The former element needs little explanation; the latter has demanded
explanation ever since human thought became comparatively instructed and abstract.

To take an example; even in the myths of savages there is much that still seems rational and
transparent. If savages tell us that some wise being taught them all the simple arts of life,
the use of fire, of the bow and arrow, the barbing of hooks, and so forth, we understand them
at once. Nothing can be more natural than that man should believe in an original inventor of
the arts, and should tell tales about the imaginary discoverers if the real heroes be forgotten.
So far all is plain sailing. But when the savage goes on to say that he who taught the use
of fire or who gave the first marriage laws was a rabbit or a crow, or a dog, or a beaver,
or a spider, then we are at once face to face with the element in myths which seems to us IRRATIONAL.
Again, among civilised peoples we read of the pure all-seeing Varuna in the Vedas, to whom
sin is an offence. We read of Indra, the Lord of Thunder, borne in his chariot, the giver of
victory, the giver of wealth to the pious; here once more all seems natural and plain. The
notion of a deity who guides the whirlwind and directs the storm, a god of battles, a god who
blesses righteousness, is familiar to us and intelligible; but when we read how Indra drank
himself drunk and committed adulteries with Asura women, and got himself born from the same
womb as a bull, and changed himself into a quail or a ram, and suffered from the most abject
physical terror, and so forth, then we are among myths no longer readily intelligible; here,
we feel, are IRRATIONAL stories, of which the original ideas, in their natural sense, can hardly
have been conceived by men in a pure and rational early civilisation. Again, in the religions
of even the lowest races, such myths as these are in contradiction with the ethical elements
of the faith.

If we look at Greek religious tradition, we observe the coexistence of the RATIONAL and the
apparently IRRATIONAL elements. The RATIONAL myths are those which represent the gods as beautiful
and wise beings. We feel, even now, that the conception of a "queen and goddess, chaste and
fair," the abbess, as Paul de Saint-Victor calls her, of the woodlands, is a beautiful and
natural fancy, which requires no explanation. On the other hand, the Artemis of Arcadia, who
is confused with the nymph Callisto, who, again, is said to have become a she-bear, and later
a star; and the Brauronian Artemis, whose maiden ministers danced a bear-dance,(2) are goddesses
whose legend seems unnatural, and needs to be made intelligible. Or, again, there is nothing
not explicable and natural in the conception of the Olympian Zeus as represented by the great
chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia, or in the Homeric conception of Zeus as a god who
"turns everywhere his shining eyes, and beholds all things, and protects the righteous, and
deals good or evil fortune to men." But the Zeus whose grave was shown in Crete, or the Zeus
who played Demeter an obscene trick by the aid of a ram, or the Zeus who, in the shape of a
swan, became the father of Castor and Pollux, or the Zeus who deceived Hera by means of a feigned
marriage with an inanimate object, or the Zeus who was afraid of Attes, or the Zeus who made
love to women in the shape of an ant or a cuckoo, is a being whose myth is felt to be unnatural
and bewildering.(3) It is this IRRATIONAL and unnatural element, as Mr. Max Muller says, "the
silly, senseless, and savage element," that makes mythology the puzzle which men have so long
found it. For, observe, Greek myth does not represent merely a humorous play of fancy, dealing
with things religiously sacred as if by way of relief from the strained reverential contemplation
of the majesty of Zeus. Many stories of Greek mythology are such as could not cross, for the
first time, the mind of a civilised Xenophanes or Theagenes, even in a dream. THIS was the
real puzzle.

(1) Odyssey, vi. 102.

(2) (Greek word omitted); compare Harpokration on this word.

(3) These are the features in myth which provoke, for example, the wonder of Emeric-David.
"The lizard, the wolf, the dog, the ass, the frog, and all the other brutes so common on religious
monuments everywhere, do they not all imply a THOUGHT which we must divine?" He concludes that
these animals, plants, and monsters of myths are so many "enigmas" and "symbols" veiling some
deep, sacred idea, allegories of some esoteric religious creed. Jupiter, Paris, 1832, p. lxxvii.

We have offered examples--Savage, Indian, and Greek--of that element in mythology which, as
all civilised races have felt, demands explanation.

To be still more explicit, we may draw up a brief list of the chief problems in the legendary
stories attached to the old religions of the world--the problems which it is our special purpose
to notice. First we have, in the myths of all races, the most grotesque conceptions of the
character of gods when mythically envisaged. Beings who, in religion, leave little to be desired,
and are spoken of as holy, immortal, omniscient, and kindly, are, in myth, represented as fashioned
in the likeness not only of man, but of the beasts; as subject to death, as ignorant and impious.

Most pre-Christian religions had their "zoomorphic" or partially zoomorphic idols, gods in
the shape of the lower animals, or with the heads and necks of the lower animals. In the same
way all mythologies represent the gods as fond of appearing in animal forms. Under these disguises
they conduct many amours, even with the daughters of men, and Greek houses were proud of their
descent from Zeus in the shape of an eagle or ant, a serpent or a swan; while Cronus and the
Vedic Tvashtri and Poseidon made love as horses, and Apollo as a dog. Not less wild are the
legends about the births of gods from the thigh, or the head, or feet, or armpits of some parent;
while tales describing and pictures representing unspeakable divine obscenities were frequent
in the mythology and in the temples of Greece. Once more, the gods were said to possess and
exercise the power of turning men and women into birds, beasts, fishes, trees, and stones,
so that there was scarcely a familiar natural object in the Greek world which had not once
(according to legend) been a man or a woman. The myths of the origin of the world and man,
again, were in the last degree childish and disgusting. The Bushmen and Australians have, perhaps,
no story of the origin of species quite so barbarous in style as the anecdotes about Phanes
and Prajapati which are preserved in the Orphic hymns and in the Brahmanas. The conduct of
the earlier dynasties of classical gods towards each other was as notoriously cruel and loathsome
as their behaviour towards mortals was tricksy and capricious. The classical gods, with all
their immortal might, are, by a mythical contradiction of the religious conception, regarded
as capable of fear and pain, and are led into scrapes as ludicrous as those of Brer Wolf or
Brer Terrapin in the tales of the Negroes of the Southern States of America. The stars, again,
in mythology, are mixed up with beasts, planets and men in the same embroglio of fantastic
opinion. The dead and the living, men, beasts and gods, trees and stars, and rivers, and sun,
and moon, dance through the region of myths in a burlesque ballet of Priapus, where everything
may be anything, where nature has no laws and imagination no limits.

Such are the irrational characteristics of myths, classic or Indian, European or American,
African or Asiatic, Australian or Maori. Such is one element we find all the world over among
civilised and savage people, quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus. It is no wonder that
pious and reflective men have, in so many ages and in so many ways, tried to account to themselves
for their possession of beliefs closely connected with religion which yet seemed ruinous to
religion and morality.

The explanations which men have given of their own sacred stories, the apologies for their
own gods which they have been constrained to offer to themselves, were the earliest babblings
of a science of mythology. That science was, in its dim beginnings, intended to satisfy a moral
need. Man found that his gods, when mythically envisaged, were not made in his own moral image
at its best, but in the image sometimes of the beasts, sometimes of his own moral nature at
its very worst: in the likeness of robbers, wizards, sorcerers, and adulterers. Now, it is
impossible here to examine minutely all systems of mythological interpretation. Every key has
been tried in this difficult lock; every cause of confusion has been taken up and tested, deemed
adequate, and finally rejected or assigned a subordinate place. Probably the first attempts
to shake off the burden of religious horror at mythical impiety were made by way of silent
omission. Thus most of the foulest myths of early India are absent, and presumably were left
out, in the Rig-Veda. "The religious sentiment of the hymns, already so elevated, has discarded
most of the tales which offended it, but has not succeeded in discarding them all."(1) Just
as the poets of the Rig-Veda prefer to avoid the more offensive traditions about Indra and
Tvashtri, so Homer succeeds in avoiding the more grotesque and puerile tales about his own
gods.(2) The period of actual apology comes later. Pindar declines, as we have seen, to accuse
a god of cannibalism. The Satapatha Brahmana invents a new story about the slaying of Visvarupa.
Not Indra, but Trita, says the Brahmana apologetically, slew the three-headed son of Tvashtri.
"Indra assuredly was free from that sin, for he is a god," says the Indian apologist.(3) Yet
sins which to us appear far more monstrous than the peccadillo of killing a three-headed Brahman
are attributed freely to Indra.

(1) Les Religions de l'Inde, Barth, p. 14. See also postea, "Indian Myths".

(2) The reasons for Homer's reticence are probably different in different passages. Perhaps
in some cases he had heard a purer version of myth than what reached Hesiod; perhaps he sometimes
purposely (like Pindar) purified a myth; usually he must have selected, in conformity with
the noble humanity and purity of his taste, the tales that best conformed to his ideal. He
makes his deities reluctant to drag out in dispute old scandals of their early unheroic adventures,
some of which, however, he gives, as the kicking of Hephaestus out of heaven, and the imprisonment
of Ares in a vessel of bronze. Compare Professor Jebb's Homer, p. 83: "whatever the instinct
of the great artist has tolerated, at least it has purged these things away." that is, divine
amours in bestial form.

(3) Satapatha Brahmana, Oxford, 1882, vol. i. p. 47.

While poets could but omit a blasphemous tale or sketch an apology in passing, it became the
business of philosophers and of antiquarian writers deliberately to "whitewash" the gods of
popular religion. Systematic explanations of the sacred stories, whether as preserved in poetry
or as told by priests, had to be provided. India had her etymological and her legendary school
of mythology.(1) Thus, while the hymn SEEMED to tell how the Maruts were gods, "born together
with the spotted deer," the etymological interpreters explained that the word for deer only
meant the many-coloured lines of clouds.(2) In the armoury of apologetics etymology has been
the most serviceable weapon. It is easy to see that by aid of etymology the most repulsive
legend may be compelled to yield a pure or harmless sense, and may be explained as an innocent
blunder, caused by mere verbal misunderstanding. Brahmans, Greeks, and Germans have equally
found comfort in this hypothesis. In the Cratylus of Plato, Socrates speaks of the notion of
explaining myths by etymological guesses at the meaning of divine names as "a philosophy which
came to him all in an instant". Thus we find Socrates shocked by the irreverence which styled
Zeus the son of Cronus, "who is a proverb for stupidity". But on examining philologically the
name Kronos, Socrates decides that it must really mean Koros, "not in the sense of a youth,
but signifying the pure and garnished mind". Therefore, when people first called Zeus the son
of Cronus, they meant nothing irreverent, but only that Zeus is the child of the pure mind
or pure reason. Not only is this etymological system most pious and consolatory, but it is,
as Socrates adds, of universal application. "For now I bethink me of a very new and ingenious
notion,... that we may put in and pull out letters at pleasure, and alter the accents."(3)

Socrates, of course, speaks more than half in irony, but there is a certain truth in his account
of etymological analysis and its dependence on individual tastes and preconceived theory.

The ancient classical schools of mythological interpretation, though unscientific and unsuccessful,
are not without interest. We find philosophers and grammarians looking, just as we ourselves
are looking, for some condition of the human intellect out of which the absurd element in myths
might conceivably have sprung. Very naturally the philosophers supposed that the human beings
in whose brain and speech myths had their origin must have been philosophers like themselves--intelligent,
educated persons. But such persons, they argued, could never have meant to tell stories about
the gods so full of nonsense and blasphemy.

Therefore the nonsense and blasphemy must originally have had some harmless, or even praiseworthy,
sense. What could that sense have been? This question each ancient mythologist answered in
accordance with his own taste and prejudices, and above all, and like all other and later speculators,
in harmony with the general tendency of his own studies. If he lived when physical speculation
was coming into fashion, as in the age of Empedocles, he thought that the Homeric poems must
contain a veiled account of physical philosophy. This was the opinion of Theagenes of Rhegium,
who wrote at a period when a crude physicism was disengaging itself from the earlier religious
and mythical cosmogonic systems of Greece. Theagenes was shocked by the Homeric description
of the battle in which the gods fought as allies of the Achaeans and Trojans. He therefore
explained away the affair as a veiled account of the strife of the elements. Such "strife"
was familiar to readers of the physical speculations of Empedocles and of Heraclitus, who blamed
Homer for his prayer against Strife.(1)

(1) Is. et Osir., 48.

It did not occur to Theagenes to ask whether any evidence existed to show that the pre-Homeric
Greeks were Empedoclean or Heraclitean philosophers. He readily proved to himself that Apollo,
Helios, and Hephaestus were allegorical representations, like what such philosophers would
feign,--of fire, that Hera was air, Poseidon water, Artemis the moon, and the rest he disposed
of in the same fashion.(1)

(1) Scholia on Iliad, xx. 67. Dindorf (1877), vol. iv. p. 231. "This manner of apologetics
is as old as Theagenes of Rhegium. Homer offers theological doctrine in the guise of physical
allegory."

Metrodorus, again, turned not only the gods, but the Homeric heroes into "elemental combinations
and physical agencies"; for there is nothing new in the mythological philosophy recently popular,
which saw the sun, and the cloud, and the wind in Achilles, Athene, and Hermes.(1)

(1) Grote, Hist, of Greece, ed. 1869, i. p. 404.

In the Bacchae (291-297), Euripides puts another of the mythological systems of his own time
into the mouth of Cadmus, the Theban king, who advances a philological explanation of the story
that Dionysus was sewn up in the thigh of Zeus. The most famous of the later theories was that
of Euhemerus (316 B.C.). In a kind of philosophical romance, Euhemerus declared that he had
sailed to some No-man's-land, Panchaea, where he found the verity about mythical times engraved
on pillars of bronze. This truth he published in the Sacra Historia, where he rationalised
the fables, averring that the gods had been men, and that the myths were exaggerated and distorted
records of facts. (See Eusebius, Praep. E., ii 55.) The Abbe Banier (La Mythologie expliquee
par l'Histoire, Paris, 1738, vol. ii. p. 218) attempts the defence of Euhemerus, whom most
of the ancients regarded as an atheist. There was an element of truth in his romantic hypothesis.(1)

(1) See Block, Euhemere et sa Doctrine, Mons, 1876.

Sometimes the old stories were said to conceal a moral, sometimes a physical, sometimes a mystical
or Neo-platonic sort of meaning. As every apologist interpreted the legends in his own fashion,
the interpretations usually disagreed and killed each other. Just as one modern mythologist
sees the wind in Aeetes and the dawn in Medea, while another of the same school believes, on
equally good evidence, that both Aeetes and Medea are the moon, so writers like Porphyry (270
A. D.) and Plutarch (60 A. D.) made the ancient deities types of their own favourite doctrines,
whatever these might happen to be.

When Christianity became powerful, the Christian writers naturally attacked heathen religion
where it was most vulnerable, on the side of the myths, and of the mysteries which were dramatic
representations of the myths. "Pretty gods you worship," said the Fathers, in effect, "homicides,
adulterers, bulls, bears, mice, ants, and what not." The heathen apologists for the old religion
were thus driven in the early ages of Christianity to various methods of explaining away the
myths of their discredited religion.

The early Christian writers very easily, and with considerable argumentative power, disposed
of the apologies for the myths advanced by Porphyry and Plutarch. Thus Eusebius in the Praeparatio
Evangelica first attacks the Egyptian interpretations of their own bestial or semi-bestial
gods. He shows that the various interpretations destroy each other, and goes on to point out
that Greek myth is in essence only a veneered and varnished version of the faith of Egypt.
He ridicules, with a good deal of humour, the old theories which resolved so many mythical
heroes into the sun; he shows that while one system is contented to regard Zeus as mere fire
and air, another system recognises in him the higher reason, while Heracles, Dionysus, Apollo,
and Asclepius, father and child, are all indifferently the sun.

Granting that the myth-makers were only constructing physical allegories, why did they wrap
them up, asks Eusebius, in what WE consider abominable fictions? In what state were the people
who could not look at the pure processes of Nature without being reminded of the most hideous
and unnatural offences? Once more: "The physical interpreters do not even agree in their physical
interpretations". All these are equally facile, equally plausible, and equally incapable of
proof. Again, Eusebius argues, the interpreters take for granted in the makers of the myths
an amount of physical knowledge which they certainly did not possess. For example, if Leto
were only another name for Hera, the character of Zeus would be cleared as far as his amour
with Leto is concerned. Now, the ancient believers in the "physical phenomena theory" of myths
made out that Hera, the wife of Zeus, was really the same person under another name as Leto,
his mistress. "For Hera is the earth" (they said at other times that Hera was the air), "and
Leto is the night; but night is only the shadow of the earth, and therefore Leto is only the
shadow of Hera." It was easy, however, to prove that this scientific view of night as the shadow
of earth was not likely to be known to myth-makers, who regarded "swift Night" as an actual
person. Plutarch, too, had an abstruse theory to explain the legend about the dummy wife,--a
log of oak-wood, which Zeus pretended to marry when at variance with Hera.(1)

(1) Pausanias, ix. 31.

This quarrel, he said, was merely the confusion and strife of elements. Zeus was heat, Hera
was cold (she had already been explained as earth and air), the dummy wife of oak-wood was
a tree that emerged after a flood, and so forth. Of course, there was no evidence that mythopoeic
men held Plutarchian theories of heat and cold and the conflict of the elements; besides, as
Eusebius pointed out, Hera had already been defined once as an allegory of wedded life, and
once as the earth, and again as the air, and it was rather too late to assert that she was
also the cold and watery element in the world. As for his own explanation of the myths, Eusebius
holds that they descend from a period when men in their lawless barbarism knew no better than
to tell such tales. "Ancient folk, in the exceeding savagery of their lives, made no account
of God, the universal Creator (here Eusebius is probably wrong)... but betook them to all manner
of abominations. For the laws of decent existence were not yet established, nor was any settled
and peaceful state ordained among men, but only a loose and savage fashion of wandering life,
while, as beasts irrational, they cared for no more than to fill their bellies, being in a
manner without God in the world." Growing a little more civilised, men, according to Eusebius,
sought after something divine, which they found in the heavenly bodies. Later, they fell to
worshipping living persons, especially "medicine men" and conjurors, and continued to worship
them even after their decease, so that Greek temples are really tombs of the dead.(1) Finally,
the civilised ancients, with a conservative reluctance to abandon their old myths (Greek text
omitted), invented for them moral or physical explanations, like those of Plutarch and others,
earlier and later.(2)

(1) Praep. E., ii. 5.

(2) Ibid., 6,19.

As Eusebius, like Clemens of Alexandria, Arnobius, and the other early Christian disputants,
had no prejudice in favour of Hellenic mythology, and no sentimental reason for wishing to
suppose that the origin of its impurities was pure, he found his way almost to the theory of
the irrational element in mythology which we propose to offer.

Even to sketch the history of mythological hypothesis in modern times would require a book
to itself. It must suffice here to indicate the various lines which speculation as to mythology
has pursued.

All interpretations of myth have been formed in accordance with the ideas prevalent in the
time of the interpreters. The early Greek physicists thought that mythopoeic men had been physicists.
Aristotle hints that they were (like himself) political philosophers.(1) Neo-platonists sought
in the myths for Neo-platonism; most Christians (unlike Eusebius) either sided with Euhemerus,
or found in myth the inventions of devils, or a tarnished and distorted memory of the Biblical
revelation.

(1) Met., xi. 8,19.

This was the theory, for example, of good old Jacob Bryant, who saw everywhere memories of
the Noachian deluge and proofs of the correctness of Old Testament ethnology.(1)

(1) Bryant, A New System, wherein an Attempt is made to Divest Tradition of Fable, 1774.

Much the same attempt to find the Biblical truth at the bottom of savage and ancient fable
has been recently made by the late M. Lenormant, a Catholic scholar.(1)

In the beginning of the present century Germany turned her attention to mythology. As usual,
men's ideas were biassed by the general nature of their opinions. In a pious kind of spirit,
Friedrich Creuzer sought to find SYMBOLS of some pure, early, and Oriental theosophy in the
myths and mysteries of Greece. Certainly the Greeks of the philosophical period explained their
own myths as symbols of higher things, but the explanation was an after-thought.(1) The great
Lobeck, in his Aglaophamus (1829), brought back common sense, and made it the guide of his
vast, his unequalled learning. In a gentler and more genial spirit, C. Otfried Muller laid
the foundation of a truly scientific and historical mythology.(2) Neither of these writers
had, like Alfred Maury,(3) much knowledge of the myths and faiths of the lower races, but they
often seem on the point of anticipating the ethnological method.

When philological science in our own century came to maturity, in philology, as of old in physics
and later in symbols, was sought the key of myths. While physical allegory, religious and esoteric
symbolism, verbal confusion, historical legend, and an original divine tradition, perverted
in ages of darkness, have been the most popular keys in other ages, the scientific nineteenth
century has had a philological key of its own. The methods of Kuhn, Breal, Max Muller, and
generally the philological method, cannot be examined here at full length.(1) Briefly speaking,
the modern philological method is intended for a scientific application of the old etymological
interpretations. Cadmus in the Bacchae of Euripides, Socrates in the Cratylus of Plato, dismiss
unpalatable myths as the results of verbal confusion. People had originally said something
quite sensible--so the hypothesis runs--but when their descendants forgot the meaning of their
remarks, a new and absurd meaning followed from a series of unconscious puns.(2) This view
was supported in ancient times by purely conjectural and impossible etymologies. Thus the myth
that Dionysus was sewn up in the THIGH of Zeus (Greek text omitted) was explained by Euripides
as the result of a confusion of words. People had originally said that Zeus gave a pledge (Greek
text omitted) to Hera. The modern philological school relies for explanations of untoward and
other myths on similar confusions. Thus Daphne is said to have been originally not a girl of
romance, but the dawn (Sanskirt, dahana: ahana) pursued by the rising sun. But as the original
Aryan sense of Dahana or Ahana was lost, and as Daphne came to mean the laurel--the wood which
burns easily--the fable arose that the tree had been a girl called Daphne.(3)

(1) See Mythology in Encyclop. Brit. and in La Mythologie (A. L.), Paris, 1886, where Mr. Max
Muller's system is criticised. See also Custom and Myth and Modern Mythology.

(2) That a considerable number of myths, chiefly myths of place names, arise from popular etymologies
is certain: what is objected to is the vast proportion given to this element in myths.

(3) Max Muller, Nineteenth Century, December, 1885; "Solar Myths," January, 1886; Myths and
Mythologists (A. L). Whitney, Mannhardt, Bergaigne, and others dispute the etymology. Or. and
Ling. Studies, 1874, p. 160; Mannhardt, Antike Wald und Feld Kultus (Berlin, 1877), p. xx.;

This system chiefly rests on comparison between the Sanskrit names in the Rig-Veda and the
mythic names in Greek, German, Slavonic, and other Aryan legends. The attempt is made to prove
that, in the common speech of the undivided Aryan race, many words for splendid or glowing
natural phenomena existed, and that natural processes were described in a figurative style.
As the various Aryan families separated, the sense of the old words and names became dim, the
nomina developed into numina, the names into gods, the descriptions of elemental processes
into myths. As this system has already been criticised by us elsewhere with minute attention,
a reference to these reviews must suffice in this place. Briefly, it may be stated that the
various masters of the school--Kuhn, Max Muller, Roth, Schwartz, and the rest--rarely agree
where agreement is essential, that is, in the philological foundations of their building. They
differ in very many of the etymological analyses of mythical names. They also differ in the
interpretations they put on the names, Kuhn almost invariably seeing fire, storm, cloud, or
lightning where Mr. Max Muller sees the chaste Dawn. Thus Mannhardt, after having been a disciple,
is obliged to say that comparative Indo-Germanic mythology has not borne the fruit expected,
and that "the CERTAIN gains of the system reduce themselves to the scantiest list of parallels,
such as Dyaus = Zeus = Tius, Parjanya = Perkunas, Bhaga = Bog, Varuna = Uranos" (a position
much disputed), etc. Mannhardt adds his belief that a number of other "equations"--such as
Sarameya = Hermeias, Saranyus = Demeter Erinnys, Kentauros = Gandharva, and many others--will
not stand criticism, and he fears that these ingenious guesses will prove mere jeux d'esprit
rather than actual facts.(1) Many examples of the precarious and contradictory character of
the results of philological mythology, many instances of "dubious etymologies," false logic,
leaps at foregone conclusions, and attempts to make what is peculiarly Indian in thought into
matter of universal application, will meet us in the chapters on Indian and Greek divine legends.(2)
"The method in its practical working shows a fundamental lack of the historical sense," says
Mannhardt. Examples are torn from their contexts, he observes; historical evolution is neglected;
passages of the Veda, themselves totally obscure, are dragged forward to account for obscure
Greek mythical phenomena. Such are the accusations brought by the regretted Mannhardt against
the school to which he originally belonged, and which was popular and all-powerful even in
the maturity of his own more clear-sighted genius. Proofs of the correctness of his criticism
will be offered abundantly in the course of this work. It will become evident that, great as
are the acquisitions of Philology, her least certain discoveries have been too hastily applied
in alien "matter," that is, in the region of myth. Not that philology is wholly without place
or part in the investigation of myth, when there is agreement among philologists as to the
meaning of a divine name. In that case a certain amount of light is thrown on the legend of
the bearer of the name, and on its origin and first home, Aryan, Greek, Semitic, or the like.
But how rare is agreement among philologists!

"The philological method," says Professor Tiele,(1) "is inadequate and misleading, when it
is a question of discovering the ORIGIN of a myth, or the physical explanation of the oldest
myths, or of accounting for the rude and obscene element in the divine legends of civilised
races. But these are not the only problems of mythology. There is, for example, the question
of the GENEALOGICAL relations of myths, where we have to determine whether the myths of peoples
whose speech is of the same family are special modifications of a mythology once common to
the race whence these peoples have sprung. The philological method alone can answer here."
But this will seem a very limited province when we find that almost all races, however remote
and unconnected in speech, have practically much the same myths.

CHAPTER II. NEW SYSTEM PROPOSED.

Chap. It has been shown that the practical need for a reconciliation between RELIGION and MORALITY
on one side, and the MYTHS about the gods on the other, produced the hypotheses of Theagenes
and Metrodorus, of Socrates and Euemerus, of Aristotle and Plutarch. It has been shown that
in each case the reconcilers argued on the basis of their own ideas and of the philosophies
of their time. The early physicist thought that myth concealed a physical philosophy; the early
etymologist saw in it a confusion of language; the early political speculator supposed that
myth was an invention of legislators; the literary Euhemerus found the secret of myths in the
course of an imaginary voyage to a fabled island. Then came the moment of the Christian attacks,
and Pagan philosophers, touched with Oriental pantheism, recognised in myths certain pantheistic
symbols and a cryptic revelation of their own Neo-platonism. When the gods were dead and their
altars fallen, then antiquaries brought their curiosity to the problem of explaining myth.
Christians recognised in it a depraved version of the Jewish sacred writings, and found the
ark on every mountain-top of Greece. The critical nineteenth century brought in, with Otfried
Muller and Lobeck, a closer analysis; and finally, in the sudden rise of comparative philology,
it chanced that philologists annexed the domain of myths. Each of these systems had its own
amount of truth, but each certainly failed to unravel the whole web of tradition and of foolish
faith.

Meantime a new science has come into existence, the science which studies man in the sum of
all his works and thoughts, as evolved through the whole process of his development. This science,
Comparative Anthropology, examines the development of law out of custom; the development of
weapons from the stick or stone to the latest repeating rifle; the development of society from
the horde to the nation. It is a study which does not despise the most backward nor degraded
tribe, nor neglect the most civilised, and it frequently finds in Australians or Nootkas the
germ of ideas and institutions which Greeks or Romans brought to perfection, or retained, little
altered from their early rudeness, in the midst of civilisation.

It is inevitable that this science should also try its hand on mythology. Our purpose is to
employ the anthropological method--the study of the evolution of ideas, from the savage to
the barbarous, and thence to the civilised stage--in the province of myth, ritual, and religion.
It has been shown that the light of this method had dawned on Eusebius in his polemic with
the heathen apologists. Spencer, the head of Corpus, Cambridge (1630-93), had really no other
scheme in his mind in his erudite work on Hebrew Ritual.(1) Spencer was a student of man's
religions generally, and he came to the conclusion that Hebrew ritual was but an expurgated,
and, so to speak, divinely "licensed" adaptation of heathen customs at large. We do but follow
his guidance on less perilous ground when we seek for the original forms of classical rite
and myth in the parallel usages and legends of the most backward races.

(1) De Legibus Hebraeorum Ritualibus, Tubingae, 1782.

Fontenelle in the last century, stated, with all the clearness of the French intellect, the
system which is partially worked out in this essay--the system which explains the irrational
element in myth as inherited from savagery. Fontenelle's paper (Sur l'Origine des Fables) is
brief, sensible, and witty, and requires little but copious evidence to make it adequate. But
he merely threw out the idea, and left it to be neglected.(1)

(1) See Appendix A., Fontenelle's Origine des Fables.

Among other founders of the anthropological or historical school of mythology, De Brosses should
not be forgotten. In his Dieux Fetiches (1760) he follows the path which Eusebius indicated--the
path of Spencer and Fontenelle--now the beaten road of Tylor and M'Lennan and Mannhardt.

In anthropology, in the science of Waitz, Tylor, and M'Lennan, in the examination of man's
faith in the light of his social, legal, and historical conditions generally, we find, with
Mannhardt, some of the keys of myth. This science "makes it manifest that the different stages
through which humanity has passed in its intellectual evolution have still their living representatives
among various existing races. The study of these lower races is an invaluable instrument for
the interpretation of the survivals from earlier stages, which we meet in the full civilisation
of cultivated peoples, but whose origins were in the remotest fetichism and savagery."(1)

(1) Mannhardt op. cit. p. xxiii.

It is by following this road, and by the aid of anthropology and of human history, that we
propose to seek for a demonstrably actual condition of the human intellect, whereof the puzzling
qualities of myth would be the natural and inevitable fruit. In all the earlier theories which
we have sketched, inquirers took it for granted that the myth-makers were men with philosophic
and moral ideas like their own--ideas which, from some reason of religion or state, they expressed
in bizarre terms of allegory. We shall attempt, on the other hand, to prove that the human
mind has passed through a condition quite unlike that of civilised men--a condition in which
things seemed natural and rational that now appear unnatural and devoid of reason, and in which,
therefore, if myths were evolved, they would, if they survived into civilisation, be such as
civilised men find strange and perplexing.

Our first question will be, Is there a stage of human society and of the human intellect in
which facts that appear to us to be monstrous and irrational--facts corresponding to the wilder
incidents of myth--are accepted as ordinary occurrences of everyday life? In the region of
romantic rather than of mythical invention we know that there is such a state. Mr. Lane, in
his preface to the Arabian Nights, says that the Arabs have an advantage over us as story-tellers.
They can introduce such incidents as the change of a man into a horse, or of a woman into a
dog, or the intervention of an Afreet without any more scruple than our own novelists feel
in describing a duel or the concealment of a will. Among the Arabs the agencies of magic and
of spirits are regarded as at least as probable and common as duels and concealments of wills
seem to be thought by European novelists. It is obvious that we need look no farther for the
explanation of the supernatural events in Arab romances. Now, let us apply this system to mythology.
It is admitted that Greeks, Romans, Aryans of India in the age of the Sanskrit commentators,
and Egyptians of the Ptolemaic and earlier ages, were as much puzzled as we are by the mythical
adventures of their gods. But is there any known stage of the human intellect in which similar
adventures, and the metamorphoses of men into animals, trees, stars, and all else that puzzles
us in the civilised mythologies, are regarded as possible incidents of daily human life? Our
answer is, that everything in the civilised mythologies which we regard as irrational seems
only part of the accepted and natural order of things to contemporary savages, and in the past
seemed equally rational and natural to savages concerning whom we have historical information.(1)
Our theory is, therefore, that the savage and senseless element in mythology is, for the most
part, a legacy from the fancy of ancestors of the civilised races who were once in an intellectual
state not higher, but probably lower, than that of Australians, Bush-men, Red Indians, the
lower races of South America, and other worse than barbaric peoples. As the ancestors of the
Greeks, Aryans of India, Egyptians and others advanced in civilisation, their religious thought
was shocked and surprised by myths (originally dating from the period of savagery, and natural
in that period, though even then often in contradiction to morals and religion) which were
preserved down to the time of Pausanias by local priesthoods, or which were stereotyped in
the ancient poems of Hesiod and Homer, or in the Brahmanas and Vedas of India, or were retained
in the popular religion of Egypt. This theory recommended itself to Lobeck. "We may believe
that ancient and early tribes framed gods like unto themselves in action and in experience,
and that the allegorical softening down of myths is the explanation added later by descendants
who had attained to purer ideas of divinity, yet dared not reject the religion of their ancestors."(2)
The senseless element in the myths would, by this theory, be for the most part a "survival";
and the age and condition of human thought whence it survived would be one in which our most
ordinary ideas about the nature of things and the limits of possibility did not yet exist,
when all things were conceived of in quite other fashion; the age, that is, of savagery.

(1) We have been asked to DEFINE a savage. He cannot be defined in an epigram, but by way of
choice of a type:--

1. In material equipment the perfect savage is he who employs tools of stone and wood, not
of metal; who is nomadic rather than settled; who is acquainted (if at all) only with the rudest
forms of the arts of potting, weaving, fire-making, etc.; and who derives more of his food
from the chase and from wild roots and plants than from any kind of agriculture or from the
flesh of domesticated animals.

2. In psychology the savage is he who (extending unconsciously to the universe his own implicit
consciousness of personality) regards all natural objects as animated and intelligent beings,
and, drawing no hard and fast line between himself and the things in the world, is readily
persuaded that men may be metamorphosed into plants, beasts and stars; that winds and clouds,
sun and dawn, are persons with human passions and parts; and that the lower animals especially
may be creatures more powerful than himself, and, in a sense, divine and creative.

3. In religion the savage is he who (while often, in certain moods, conscious of a far higher
moral faith) believes also in ancestral ghosts or spirits of woods and wells that were never
ancestral; prays frequently by dint of magic; and sometimes adores inanimate objects, or even
appeals to the beasts as supernatural protectors.

4. In society the savage is he who (as a rule) bases his laws on the well-defined lines of
totemism--that is, claims descent from or other close relation to natural objects, and derives
from the sacredness of those objects the sanction of his marriage prohibitions and blood-feuds,
while he makes skill in magic a claim to distinguished rank.

Such, for our purpose, is the savage, and we propose to explain the more "senseless" factors
in civilised mythology as "survivals" of these ideas and customs preserved by conservatism
and local tradition, or, less probably, borrowed from races which were, or had been, savage.

(2) Aglaoph., i. 153. Had Lobeck gone a step farther and examined the mental condition of veteres
et priscae gentes, this book would have been, superfluous. Nor did he know that the purer ideas
were also existing among certain low savages.

It is universally admitted that "survivals" of this kind do account for many anomalies in our
institutions, in law, politics, society, even in dress and manners. If isolated fragments of
earlier ages abide in these, it is still more probable that other fragments will survive in
anything so closely connected as is mythology with the conservative religious sentiment and
tradition. Our object, then, is to prove that the "silly, savage, and irrational" element in
the myths of civilised peoples is, as a rule, either a survival from the period of savagery,
or has been borrowed from savage neighbours by a cultivated people, or, lastly, is an imitation
by later poets of old savage data.(1) For example, to explain the constellations as metamorphosed
men, animals, or other objects of terrestrial life is the habit of savages,(2)--a natural habit
among people who regard all things as on one level of personal life and intelligence. When
the stars, among civilised Greeks or Aryans of India, are also popularly regarded as transformed
and transfigured men, animals and the like, this belief may be either a survival from the age
when the ancestors of Greeks and Indians were in the intellectual condition of the Australian
Murri; or the star-name and star-myth may have been borrowed from savages, or from cultivated
peoples once savage or apt to copy savages; or, as in the case of the Coma Berenices, a poet
of a late age may have invented a new artificial myth on the old lines of savage fancy.

(1) We may be asked why do savages entertain the irrational ideas which survive in myth? One
might as well ask why they eat each other, or use stones instead of metal. Their intellectual
powers are not fully developed, and hasty analogy from their own unreasoned consciousness is
their chief guide. Myth, in Mr. Darwin's phrase, is one of the "miserable and indirect consequences
of our highest faculties". Descent of Man, p. 69.

(2) See Custom and Myth, "Star-Myths".

This method of interpreting a certain element in mythology is, we must repeat, no new thing,
though, to judge from the protests of several mythologists, it is new to many inquirers. We
have seen that Eusebius threw out proposals in this direction; that Spencer, De Brosses, and
Fontenelle unconsciously followed him; and we have quoted from Lobeck a statement of a similar
opinion. The whole matter has been stated as clearly as possible by Mr. B. B. Tylor:--

"Savages have been for untold ages, and still are, living in the myth-making stage of the human
mind. It was through sheer ignorance and neglect of this direct knowledge how and by what manner
of men myths are really made that their simple philosophy has come to be buried under masses
of commentator's rubbish..."(1) Mr. Tylor goes on thus (and his words contain the gist of our
argument): "The general thesis maintained is that myth arose in the savage condition prevalent
in remote ages among the whole human race; that it remains comparatively unchanged among the
rude modern tribes who have departed least from these primitive conditions, while higher and
later civilisations, partly by retaining its actual principles, and partly by carrying on its
inherited results in the form of ancestral tradition, continued it not merely in toleration,
but in honour".(2) Elsewhere Mr. Tylor points out that by this method of interpretation we
may study myths in various stages of evolution, from the rude guess of the savage at an explanation
of natural phenomena, through the systems of the higher barbarisms, or lower civilisations
(as in ancient Mexico), and the sacerdotage of India, till myth reaches its most human form
in Greece. Yet even in Greek myth the beast is not wholly cast out, and Hellas by no means
"let the ape and tiger die". That Mr. Tylor does not exclude the Aryan race from his general
theory is plain enough.(3) "What is the Aryan conception of the Thunder-god but a poetic elaboration
of thoughts inherited from the savage stage through which the primitive Aryans had passed?"(4)

(1) Primitive Culture, 2nd edit., i. p. 283.

(2) Op. cit., p. 275.

(3) Primitive Culture, 2nd edit., ii. 265.

(4) Pretty much the same view seems to be taken by Mr. Max Muller (Nineteenth Century, January,
1882) when he calls Tsui Goab (whom the Hottentots believe to be a defunct conjuror) "a Hottentot
Indra or Zeus".

The advantages of our hypothesis (if its legitimacy be admitted) are obvious. In the first
place, we have to deal with an actual demonstrable condition of the human intellect. The existence
of the savage state in all its various degrees, and of the common intellectual habits and conditions
which are shared by the backward peoples, and again the survival of many of these in civilisation,
are indubitable facts. We are not obliged to fall back upon some fanciful and unsupported theory
of what "primitive man" did, and said, and thought. Nay, more; we escape all the fallacies
connected with the terms "primitive man". We are not compelled (as will be shown later)(1)
to prove that the first men of all were like modern savages, nor that savages represent primitive
man. It may be that the lowest extant savages are the nearest of existing peoples to the type
of the first human beings. But on this point it is unnecessary for us to dogmatise. If we can
show that, whether men began their career as savages or not, they have at least passed through
the savage status or have borrowed the ideas of races in the savage status, that is all we
need. We escape from all the snares of theories (incapable of historical proof) about the really
primeval and original condition of the human family.

(1) Appendix B.

Once more, our theory naturally attaches itself to the general system of Evolution. We are
enabled to examine mythology as a thing of gradual development and of slow and manifold modifications,
corresponding in some degree to the various changes in the general progress of society. Thus
we shall watch the barbaric conditions of thought which produce barbaric myths, while these
in their turn are retained, or perhaps purified, or perhaps explained away, by more advanced
civilisations. Further, we shall be able to detect the survival of the savage ideas with least
modification, and the persistence of the savage myths with least change, among the classes
of a civilised population which have shared least in the general advance. These classes are,
first, the rustic peoples, dwelling far from cities and schools, on heaths or by the sea; second,
the conservative local priesthoods, who retain the more crude and ancient myths of the local
gods and heroes after these have been modified or rejected by the purer sense of philosophers
and national poets. Thus much of ancient myth is a woven warp and woof of three threads: the
savage donnee, the civilised and poetic modification of the savage donnee, the version of the
original fable which survives in popular tales and in the "sacred chapters" of local priesthoods.
A critical study of these three stages in myth is in accordance with the recognised practice
of science. Indeed, the whole system is only an application to this particular province, mythology,
of the method by which the development either of organisms or of human institutions is traced.
As the anomalies and apparently useless and accidental features in the human or in other animal
organisms may be explained as stunted or rudimentary survivals of organs useful in a previous
stage of life, so the anomalous and irrational myths of civilised races may be explained as
survivals of stories which, in an earlier state of thought and knowledge, seemed natural enough.
The persistence of the myths is accounted for by the well-known conservatism of the religious
sentiment--a conservatism noticed even by Eusebius. "In later days, when they became ashamed
of the religious beliefs of their ancestors, they invented private and respectful interpretations,
each to suit himself. For no one dared to shake the ancestral beliefs, as they honoured at
a very high rate the sacredness and antiquity of old associations, and of the teaching they
had received in childhood."(1)

(1) Praep. E., ii. 6, 19.

Thus the method which we propose to employ is in harmony both with modern scientific procedure
and with the views of a clear-sighted Father of the Church. Consequently no system could well
be less "heretical" and "unorthodox".

The last advantage of our hypothesis which need here be mentioned is that it helps to explain
the DIFFUSION no less than the ORIGIN of the wild and crazy element in myth. We seek for the
origin of the savage factor of myth in one aspect of the intellectual condition of savages.
We say "in one aspect" expressly; to guard against the suggestion that the savage intellect
has no aspect but this, and no saner ideas than those of myth. The DIFFUSION of stories practically
identical in every quarter of the globe may be (provisionally) regarded as the result of the
prevalence in every quarter, at one time or another, of similar mental habits and ideas. This
explanation must not be pressed too hard nor too far. If we find all over the world a belief
that men can change themselves and their neighbours into beasts, that belief will account for
the appearance of metamorphosis in myth. If we find a belief that inanimate objects are really
much on a level with man, the opinion will account for incidents of myth such as that in which
the wooden figure-head of the Argo speaks with a human voice. Again, a widespread belief in
the separability of the soul or the life from the body will account for the incident in nursery
tales and myths of the "giant who had no heart in his body," but kept his heart and life elsewhere.
An ancient identity of mental status and the working of similar mental forces at the attempt
to explain the same phenomena will account, without any theory of borrowing, or transmission
of myth, or of original unity of race, for the world-wide diffusion of many mythical conceptions.

But this theory of the original similarity of the savage mind everywhere and in all races will
scarcely account for the world-wide distribution of long and intricate mythical PLOTS, of consecutive
series of adroitly interwoven situations. In presence of these long romances, found among so
many widely severed peoples, conjecture is, at present, almost idle. We do not know, in many
instances, whether such stories were independently developed, or carried from a common centre,
or borrowed by one race from another, and so handed on round the world.

This chapter may conclude with an example of a tale whose DIFFUSION may be explained in divers
ways, though its ORIGIN seems undoubtedly savage. If we turn to the Algonkins, a stock of Red
Indians, we come on a popular tradition which really does give pause to the mythologist. Could
this story, he asks himself, have been separately invented in widely different places, or could
the Iroquois have borrowed from the Australian blacks or the Andaman Islanders? It is a common
thing in most mythologies to find everything of value to man--fire, sun, water--in the keeping
of some hostile power. The fire, or the sun, or the water is then stolen, or in other ways
rescued from the enemy and restored to humanity. The Huron story (as far as water is concerned)
is told by Father Paul Le Jeune, a Jesuit missionary, who lived among the Hurons about 1636.
The myth begins with the usual opposition between two brothers, the Cain and Abel of savage
legend. One of the brothers, named Ioskeha, slew the other, and became the father of mankind
(as known to the Red Indians) and the guardian of the Iroquois.

Now where, outside of North America, do we find this frog who swallowed all the water? We find
him in Australia.

"The aborigines of Lake Tyers," remarks Mr. Brough Smyth, "say that at one time there was no
water anywhere on the face of the earth. All the waters were contained in the body of a huge
frog, and men and women could get none of them. A council was held, and... it was agreed that
the frog should be made to laugh, when the waters would run out of his mouth, and there would
be plenty in all parts."

To make a long story short, all the animals played the jester before the gigantic solemn frog,
who sat as grave as Louis XV. "I do not like buffoons who don't make me laugh," said that majestical
monarch. At last the eel danced on the tip of his tail, and the gravity of the prodigious Batrachian
gave way. He laughed till he literally split his sides, and the imprisoned waters came with
a rush. Indeed, many persons were drowned, though this is not the only Australian version of
the Deluge.

The Andaman Islanders dwell at a very considerable distance from Australia and from the Iroquois,
and, in the present condition of the natives of Australia and Andaman, neither could possibly
visit the other. The frog in the Andaman version is called a toad, and he came to swallow the
waters in the following way: One day a woodpecker was eating honey high up in the boughs of
a tree. Far below, the toad was a witness of the feast, and asked for some honey. "Well, come
up here, and you shall have some," said the woodpecker. "But how am I to climb?" "Take hold
of that creeper, and I will draw you up," said the woodpecker; but all the while he was bent
on a practical joke. So the toad got into a bucket he happened to possess, and fastened the
bucket to the creeper. "Now, pull!" Then the woodpecker raised the toad slowly to the level
of the bough where the honey was, and presently let him down with a run, not only disappointing
the poor toad, but shaking him severely. The toad went away in a rage and looked about him
for revenge. A happy thought occurred to him, and he drank up all the water of the rivers and
lakes. Birds and beasts were perishing, woodpeckers among them, of thirst. The toad, overjoyed
at his success, wished to add insult to the injury, and, very thoughtlessly, began to dance
in an irritating manner at his foes. But then the stolen waters gushed out of his mouth in
full volume, and the drought soon ended. One of the most curious points in this myth is the
origin of the quarrel between the woodpecker and the toad. The same beginning--the tale of
an insult put on an animal by hauling up and letting him down with a run--occurs in an African
Marchen.(1)

(1) Brough Smyth, Aborigines of Victoria, i. 429, 430; Brinton, American Hero Myths, i. 55.
Cf. also Relations de la Nouvelle France, 1636, 1640, 1671; (Sagard, Hist. du Canada, 1636,
p. 451;) Journal Anthrop. Inst., 1881.

Now this strangely diffused story of the slaying of the frog which had swallowed all the water
seems to be a savage myth of which the more heroic conflict of Indra with Vrittra (the dragon
which had swallowed all the waters) is an epic and sublimer version.(1) "The heavenly water,
which Vrittra withholds from the world, is usually the prize of the contest."

(1) Ludwig, Der Rig-Veda, iii. p. 337. See postea, "Divine Myths of India".

The serpent of Vedic myth is, perhaps, rather the robber-guardian than the swallower of the
waters, but Indra is still, like the Iroquois Ioskeha, "he who wounds the full one".(1) This
example of the wide distribution of a myth shows how the question of diffusion, though connected
with, is yet distinct from that of origin. The advantage of our method will prove to be, that
it discovers an historical and demonstrable state of mind as the origin of the wild element
in myth. Again, the wide prevalence in the earliest times of this mental condition will, to
a certain extent, explain the DISTRIBUTION of myth. Room must be left, of course, for processes
of borrowing and transmission, but how Andamanese, Australians and Hurons could borrow from
each other is an unsolved problem.

(1) Gubernatis, Zoological Myth. ii. 395, note 2. "When Indra kills the serpent he opens the
torrent of the waters" (p. 393). See also Aitareya Brahmana, translated by Haug, ii. 483.

Finally, our hypothesis is not involved in dubious theories of race. To us, myths appear to
be affected (in their origins) much less by the race than by the stage of culture attained
by the people who cherish them. A fight for the waters between a monstrous dragon like Vrittra
and a heroic god like Indra is a nobler affair than a quarrel for the waters between a woodpecker
and a toad. But the improvement and transfiguration, so to speak, of a myth at bottom the same
is due to the superior culture, not to the peculiar race, of the Vedic poets, except so far
as culture itself depends on race. How far the purer culture was attained to by the original
superiority of the Aryan over the Andaman breed, it is not necessary for our purpose to inquire.
Thus, on the whole, we may claim for our system a certain demonstrable character, which helps
to simplify the problems of mythology, and to remove them from the realm of fanciful guesses
and conflicting etymological conjectures into that of sober science. That these pretensions
are not unacknowledged even by mythologists trained in other schools is proved by the remarks
of Dr. Tiele.(1)

(1) Rev. de l'Hist. des Rel., "Le Mythe de Cronos," January, 1886. Dr. Tiele is not, it must
be noted, a thorough adherent of our theory. See Modern Mythology: "The Question of Allies".

Dr. Tiele writes: "If I were obliged to choose between this method" (the system here advocated)
"and that of comparative philology, it is the former that I would adopt without the slightest
hesitation. This method alone enables us to explain the fact, which has so often provoked amazement,
that people so refined as the Greeks,... or so rude, but morally pure, as the Germans,... managed
to attribute to their gods all manner of cowardly, cruel and disorderly conduct. This method
alone explains the why and wherefore of all those strange metamorphoses of gods into beasts
and plants, and even stones, which scandalised philosophers, and which the witty Ovid played
on for the diversion of his contemporaries. In short, this method teaches us to recognise in
all those strange stories the survivals of a barbaric age, long passed away, but enduring to
later times in the form of religious traditions, of all traditions the most persistent....
Finally, this method alone enables us to explain the origin of myths, because it endeavours
to study them in their rudest and most primitive shape, thus allowing their true significance
to be much more clearly apparent than it can be in the myths (so often touched, retouched,
augmented and humanised) which are current among races arrived at a certain degree of culture."

The method is to this extent applauded by a most competent authority, and it has been warmly
accepted by a distinguished French school of students, represented by M. Gaidoz. But it is
obvious that the method rests on a double hypothesis: first, that satisfactory evidence as
to the mental conditions of the lower and backward races is obtainable; second, that the civilised
races (however they began) either passed through the savage state of thought and practice,
or borrowed very freely from people in that condition. These hypotheses have been attacked
by opponents; the trustworthiness of our evidence, especially, has been assailed. By way of
facilitating the course of the exposition and of lessening the disturbing element of controversy,
a reply to the objections and a defence of the evidence has been relegated to an Appendix.(1)
Meanwhile we go on to examine the peculiar characteristics of the mental condition of savages
and of peoples in the lower and upper barbarisms.

We set out to discover a stage of human intellectual development which would necessarily produce
the essential elements of myth. We think we have found that stage in the condition of savagery.
We now proceed to array the evidence for the mental processes of savages. We intend to demonstrate
the existence in practical savage life of the ideas which most surprise us when we find them
in civilised sacred legends.

For the purposes of this inquiry, it is enough to select a few special peculiarities of savage
thought.

1. First we have that nebulous and confused frame of mind to which all things, animate or inanimate,
human, animal, vegetable, or inorganic, seem on the same level of life, passion and reason.
The savage, at all events when myth-making, draws no hard and fast line between himself and
the things in the world. He regards himself as literally akin to animals and plants and heavenly
bodies; he attributes sex and procreative powers even to stones and rocks, and he assigns human
speech and human feelings to sun and moon and stars and wind, no less than to beasts, birds
and fishes.(1)

(1) "So fasst auch das Alterthum ihren Unterschied von den Menschen ganz anders als die spatere
Zeit."--Grimm, quoted by Liebrecht, Zur Volkskunde, p. 17.

2. The second point to note in savage opinion is the belief in magic and sorcery. The world
and all the things in it being vaguely conceived of as sensible and rational, obey the commands
of certain members of the tribe, chiefs, jugglers, conjurors, or what you will. Rocks open
at their order, rivers dry up, animals are their servants and hold converse with them. These
magicians cause or heal diseases, and can command even the weather, bringing rain or thunder
or sunshine at their will.(1) There are few supernatural attributes of "cloud-compelling Zeus"
or of Apollo that are not freely assigned to the tribal conjuror. By virtue, doubtless, of
the community of nature between man and the things in the world, the conjuror (like Zeus or
Indra) can assume at will the shape of any animal, or can metamorphose his neighbours or enemies
into animal forms.

(1) See Roth in North-West Central Queensland Aborigines, chapter xii., 1897.

3. Another peculiarity of savage belief naturally connects itself with that which has just
been described. The savage has very strong ideas about the persistent existence of the souls
of the dead. They retain much of their old nature, but are often more malignant after death
than they had been during life. They are frequently at the beck and call of the conjuror, whom
they aid with their advice and with their magical power. By virtue of the close connection
already spoken of between man and the animals, the souls of the dead are not rarely supposed
to migrate into the bodies of beasts, or to revert to the condition of that species of creatures
with which each tribe supposes itself to be related by ties of kinship or friendship. With
the usual inconsistency of mythical belief, the souls of the dead are spoken of, at other times,
as if they inhabited a spiritual world, sometimes a paradise of flowers, sometimes a gloomy
place, which mortal men may visit, but whence no one can escape who has tasted of the food
of the ghosts.

4. In connection with spirits a far-reaching savage philosophy prevails. It is not unusual
to assign a ghost to all objects, animate or inanimate, and the spirit or strength of a man
is frequently regarded as something separable, capable of being located in an external object,
or something with a definite locality in the body. A man's strength and spirit may reside in
his kidney fat, in his heart, in a lock of his hair, or may even be stored by him in some separate
receptacle. Very frequently a man is held capable of detaching his soul from his body, and
letting it roam about on his business, sometimes in the form of a bird or other animal.

5. Many minor savage beliefs might be named, such as the common faith in friendly or protecting
animals, and the notion that "natural deaths" (as we call them) are always UNNATURAL, that
death is always caused by some hostile spirit or conjuror. From this opinion comes the myth
that man is naturally not subject to death: that death was somehow introduced into the world
by a mistake or misdeed is a corollary. (See "Myths of the Origin of Death" in Modern Mythology.)

6. One more mental peculiarity of the savage mind remains to be considered in this brief summary.
The savage, like the civilised man, is curious. The first faint impulses of the scientific
spirit are at work in his brain; he is anxious to give himself an account of the world in which
he finds himself. But he is not more curious than he is, on occasion, credulous. His intellect
is eager to ask questions, as is the habit of children, but his intellect is also lazy, and
he is content with the first answer that comes to hand. "Ils s'arretent aux premieres notions
qu'ils en ont," says Pere Hierome Lalemant.(1) "Nothing," says Schoolcraft, "is too capacious
(sic) for Indian belief."(2) The replies to his questions he receives from tradition or (when
a new problem arises) evolves an answer for himself in the shape of STORIES. Just as Socrates,
in the Platonic dialogues, recalls or invents a myth in the despair of reason, so the savage
has a story for answer to almost every question that he can ask himself. These stories are
in a sense scientific, because they attempt a solution of the riddles of the world. They are
in a sense religious, because there is usually a supernatural power, a deus ex machina, of
some sort to cut the knot of the problem. Such stories, then, are the science, and to a certain
extent the religious tradition, of savages.(3)

(1) Relations de la Nouvelle France, 1648, p. 70.

(2) Algic Researches, i. 41.

(3) "The Indians (Algonkins) conveyed instruction--moral, mechanical and religious--through
traditionary fictions and tales."--Schoolcraft, Algic Researches, i. 12.

Now these tales are necessarily cast in the mould of the savage ideas of which a sketch has
been given. The changes of the heavenly bodies, the processes of day and night, the existence
of the stars, the invention of the arts, the origin of the world (as far as known to the savage),
of the tribe, of the various animals and plants, the origin of death itself, the origin of
the perplexing traditional tribal customs, are all accounted for in stories. At the same time,
an actual divine Maker is sometimes postulated. The stories, again, are fashioned in accordance
with the beliefs already named: the belief in human connection with and kinship with beasts
and plants; the belief in magic; the belief in the perpetual possibility of metamorphosis or
"shape shifting"; the belief in the permanence and power of the ghosts of the dead; the belief
in the personal and animated character of all the things in the world, and so forth.

No more need be said to explain the wild and (as it seems to us moderns) the irrational character
of savage myth. It is a jungle of foolish fancies, a walpurgis nacht of gods and beasts and
men and stars and ghosts, all moving madly on a level of common personality and animation,
and all changing shapes at random, as partners are changed in some fantastic witches' revel.
Such is savage mythology, and how could it be otherwise when we consider the elements of thought
and belief out of which it is mainly composed? We shall see that part of the mythology of the
Greeks or the Aryans of India is but a similar walpurgis nacht, in which an incestuous or amorous
god may become a beast, and the object of his pursuit, once a woman, may also become a beast,
and then shift shapes to a tree or a bird or a star. But in the civilised races the genius
of the people tends to suppress, exclude and refine away the wild element, which, however,
is never wholly eliminated. The Erinyes soon stop the mouth of the horse of Achilles when he
begins, like the horse in Grimm's Goose Girl, to hold a sustained conversation.(1) But the
ancient, cruel, and grotesque savage element, nearly overcome by Homer and greatly reduced
by the Vedic poets, breaks out again in Hesiod, in temple legends and Brahmanic glosses, and
finally proves so strong that it can only be subdued by Christianity, or rather by that break
between the educated classes and the traditional past of religion which has resulted from Christianity.
Even so, myth lingers in the folk-lore of the non-progressive classes of Europe, and, as in
Roumania, invades religion.

(1) Iliad, xix. 418.

We have now to demonstrate the existence in the savage intellect of the various ideas and habits
which we have described, and out of which mythology springs.

(1) Creuzer and Guigniaut, vol. i. p. 111.

The opinion of Mr. Tylor is naturally of great value, as it is formed on as wide an acquaintance
with the views of the lower races as any inquirers can hope to possess. Mr. Tylor observes:
"We have to inform ourselves of the savage man's idea, which is very different from the civilised
man's, of the nature of the lower animals.... The sense of an absolute psychical distinction
between man and beast, so prevalent in the civilised world, is hardly to be found among the
lower races."(1) The universal attribution of "souls" to all things--the theory known as "Animism"--is
another proof that the savage draws no hard and fast line between man and the other things
in the world. The notion of the Italian country-people, that cruelty to an animal does not
matter because it is not a "Christian," has no parallel in the philosophy of the savage, to
whom all objects seem to have souls, just as men have. Mr. Im Thurn found the absence of any
sense of a difference between man and nature a characteristic of his native companions in Guiana.
"The very phrase, 'Men and other animals,' or even, as it is often expressed, 'Men and animals,'
based as it is on the superiority which civilised man feels over other animals, expresses a
dichotomy which is in no way recognised by the Indian.... It is therefore most important to
realise how comparatively small really is the difference between men in a state of savagery
and other animals, and how completely even such difference as exists escapes the notice of
savage men... It is not, therefore, too much to say that, according to the view of the Indians,
other animals differ from men only in bodily form and in their various degrees of strength;
in spirit they do not differ at all."(2) The Indian's notion of the life of plants and stones
is on the same level of unreason, as we moderns reckon reason. He believes in the spirits of
rocks and stones, undeterred by the absence of motion in these objects. "Not only many rocks,
but also many waterfalls, streams, and indeed material objects of every sort, are supposed
each to consist of a body and a spirit, as does man."(3) It is not our business to ask here
how men came by the belief in universal animation. That belief is gradually withdrawn, distinctions
are gradually introduced, as civilisation and knowledge advance. It is enough for us if the
failure to draw a hard and fast line between man and beasts, stones and plants, be practically
universal among savages, and if it gradually disappears before the fuller knowledge of civilisation.
The report which Mr. Im Thurn brings from the Indians of Guiana is confirmed by what Schoolcraft
says of the Algonkin races of the northern part of the continent. "The belief of the narrators
and listeners in every wild and improbable thing told helps wonderfully in the original stories,
in joining all parts together. The Indian believes that the whole visible and invisible creation
is animated.... To make the matter worse, these tribes believe that animals of the lowest as
well as highest class in the chain of creation are alike endowed with reasoning powers and
faculties. As a natural conclusion they endow birds, beasts and all other animals with souls."(4)
As an example of the ease with which the savage recognises consciousness and voluntary motion
even in stones, may be cited Kohl's account of the beliefs of the Objibeways.(5) Nearly every
Indian has discovered, he says, an object in which he places special confidence, and to which
he sacrifices more zealously than to the Great Spirit. The "hope" of Otamigan (a companion
of the traveller) was a rock, which once advanced to meet him, swayed, bowed and went back
again. Another Indian revered a Canadian larch, "because he once heard a very remarkable rustling
in its branches". It thus appears that while the savage has a general kind of sense that inanimate
things are animated, he is a good deal impressed by their conduct when he thinks that they
actually display their animation. In the same way a devout modern spiritualist probably regards
with more reverence a table which he has seen dancing and heard rapping than a table at which
he has only dined. Another general statement of failure to draw the line between men and the
irrational creation is found in the old Jesuit missionary Le Jeune's Relations de la Nouvelle
France.(6) "Les sauvages se persuadent que non seulement les hommes et les autres animaux,
mais aussi que toutes les autres choses sont animees." Again: "Ils tiennent les poissons raisonnables,
comme aussi les cerfs". In the Solomon Islands, Mr. Romilly sailed with an old chief who used
violent language to the waves when they threatened to dash over the boat, and "old Takki's
exhortations were successful".(7) Waitz(8) discovers the same attitude towards the animals
among the negroes. Man, in their opinion, is by no means a separate sort of person on the summit
of nature and high above the beasts; these he rather regards as dark and enigmatic beings,
whose life is full of mystery, and which he therefore considers now as his inferiors, now as
his superiors. A collection of evidence as to the savage failure to discriminate between human
and non-human, animate and inanimate, has been brought together by Sir John Lubbock.(9)

To a race accustomed like ourselves to arrange and classify, to people familiar from childhood
and its games with "vegetable, animal and mineral," a condition of mind in which no such distinctions
are drawn, any more than they are drawn in Greek or Brahmanic myths, must naturally seem like
what Mr. Max Muller calls "temporary insanity". The imagination of the savage has been defined
by Mr. Tylor as "midway between the conditions of a healthy, prosaic, modern citizen, and of
a raving fanatic, or of a patient in a fever-ward". If any relics of such imagination survive
in civilised mythology, they will very closely resemble the productions of a once universal
"temporary insanity". Let it be granted, then, that "to the lower tribes of man, sun and stars,
trees and rivers, winds and clouds, become personal, animate creatures, leading lives conformed
to human or animal analogies, and performing their special functions in the universe with the
aid of limbs like beasts, or of artificial instruments like men; or that what men's eyes behold
is but the instrument to be used or the material to be shaped, while behind it there stands
some prodigious but yet half-human creature, who grasps it with his hands or blows it with
his breath. The basis on which such ideas as these are built is not to be narrowed down to
poetic fancy and transformed metaphor. They rest upon a broad philosophy of nature; early and
crude, indeed, but thoughtful, consistent, and quite really and seriously meant."(1)

For the sake of illustration, some minor examples must next be given of this confusion between
man and other things in the world, which will presently be illustrated by the testimony of
a powerful and long diffused set of institutions.

The Christian Quiches of Guatemala believe that each of them has a beast as his friend and
protector, just as in the Highlands "the dog is the friend of the Maclaines". When the Finns,
in their epic poem the Kalewala, have killed a bear, they implore the animal to forgive them.
"Oh, Ot-so," chant the singers, "be not angry that we come near thee. The bear, the honey-footed
bear, was born in lands between sun and moon, and he died, not by men's hands, but of his own
will."(1) The Red Men of North America(2) have a tradition showing how it is that the bear
does not die, but, like Herodotus with the sacred stories of the Egyptian priests, Mr. Schoolcraft
"cannot induce himself to write it out".(3) It is a most curious fact that the natives of Australia
tell a similar tale of THEIR "native bear". "He did not die" when attacked by men.(4) In parts
of Australia it is a great offence to skin the native bear, just as on a part of the west coast
of Ireland, where seals are superstitiously regarded, the people cannot be bribed to skin them.
In New Caledonia, when a child tries to kill a lizard, the men warn him to "beware of killing
his own ancestor".(5) The Zulus spare to destroy a certain species of serpents, believed to
be the spirits of kinsmen, as the great snake which appeared when Aeneas did sacrifice was
held to be the ghost of Anchises. Mexican women(6) believed that children born during an eclipse
turn into mice. In Australia the natives believe that the wild dog has the power of speech;
whoever listens to him is petrified; and a certain spot is shown where "the wild dog spoke
and turned the men into stone";(7) and the blacks run for their lives as soon as the dog begins
to speak. What it said was "Bones".

These are minor examples of a form of opinion which is so strong that it is actually the chief
constituent in savage society. That society, whether in Ashantee or Australia, in North America
or South Africa, or North Asia or India, or among the wilder tribes of ancient Peru, is based
on an institution generally called "totemism". This very extraordinary institution, whatever
its origin, cannot have arisen except among men capable of conceiving kinship and all human
relationships as existing between themselves and all animate and inanimate things. It is the
rule, and not the exception, that savage societies are founded upon this belief. The political
and social conduct of the backward races is regulated in such matters as blood-feud and marriage
by theories of the actual kindred and connection by descent, or by old friendship, which men
have in common with beasts, plants, the sun and moon, the stars, and even the wind and the
rain. Now, in whatever way this belief in such relations to beasts and plants may have arisen,
it undoubtedly testifies to a condition of mind in which no hard and fast line was drawn between
man and animate and inanimate nature. The discovery of the wide distribution of the social
arrangements based on this belief is entirely due to Mr. J. F. M'Lennan, the author of Primitive
Marriage. Mr. M'Lennan's essays ("The Worship of Plants and Animals," "Totems and Totemism")
were published in the Fortnightly Review, 1869-71. Any follower in the footsteps of Mr. M'Lennan
has it in his power to add a little evidence to that originally set forth, and perhaps to sift
the somewhat uncritical authorities adduced.(1)

(1) See also Mr. Frazer's Totemism, and Golden Bough, with chapter on Totemism in Modern Mythology.

The name "Totemism" or "Totamism" was first applied at the end of the last century by Long(1)
to the Red Indian custom which acknowledges human kinship with animals. This institution had
already been recognised among the Iroquois by Lafitau,(2) and by other observers. As to the
word "totem," Mr. Max Muller(3) quotes an opinion that the interpreters, missionaries, Government
inspectors, and others who apply the name totem to the Indian "family mark" must have been
ignorant of the Indian languages, for there is in them no such word as totem. The right word,
it appears, is otem; but as "totemism" has the advantage of possessing the ground, we prefer
to say "totemism" rather than "otemism". The facts are the same, whatever name we give them.
As Mr. Muller says himself,(4) "every warrior has his crest, which is called his totem";(5)
and he goes on to describe a totem of an Indian who died about 1793. We may now return to the
consideration of "otemism" or totemism. We approach it rather as a fact in the science of mythology
than as a stage in the evolution of the modern family system. For us totemism is interesting
because it proves the existence of that savage mental attitude which assumes kindred and alliance
between man and the things in the world. As will afterwards be seen, totemism has also left
its mark on the mythologies of the civilised races. We shall examine the institution first
as it is found in Australia, because the Australian form of totemism shows in the highest known
degree the savage habit of confusing in a community of kinship men, stars, plants, beasts,
the heavenly bodies, and the forces of Nature. When this has once been elucidated, a shorter
notice of other totemistic races will serve our purpose.

The society of the Murri or black fellows of Australia is divided into local tribes, each of
which possesses, or used to possess, and hunt over a considerable tract of country. These local
tribes are united by contiguity, and by common local interests, but not necessarily by blood
kinship. For example, the Port Mackay tribe, the Mount Gambier tribe, the Ballarat tribe, all
take their names from their district. In the same way we might speak of the people of Strathclyde
or of Northumbria in early English history. Now, all these local tribes contain an indefinite
number of stocks of kindred, of men believing themselves to be related by the ties of blood
and common descent. That descent the groups agree in tracing, not from some real or idealised
human parent, but from some animal, plant, or other natural object, as the kangaroo, the emu,
the iguana, the pelican, and so forth. Persons of the pelican stock in the north of Queensland
regard themselves as relations of people of the same stock in the most southern parts of Australia.
The creature from which each tribe claims descent is called "of the same flesh," while persons
of another stock are "fresh flesh". A native may not marry a woman of "his own flesh"; it is
only a woman of "fresh" or "strange" flesh he may marry. A man may not eat an animal of "his
own flesh"; he may only eat "strange flesh". Only under great stress of need will an Australian
eat the animal which is the flesh-and-blood cousin and protector of his stock.(1) (These rules
of marriage and blood, however, do not apply among the Arunta of Central Australia, whose Totems
(if Totems they should be called) have been developed on very different lines.(2)) Clearer
evidence of the confusion between man and beast, of the claiming of kin between man and beast,
could hardly be.

But the Australian philosophy of the intercommunion of Nature goes still farther than this.
Besides the local divisions and the kindred stocks which trace their descent from animals,
there exist among many Australian tribes divisions of a kind still unexplained. For example,
every man of the Mount Gambier local tribe is by birth either a Kumite or a Kroki. This classification
applies to the whole of the sensible universe. Thus smoke and honeysuckle trees belong to the
division Kumite, and are akin to the fishhawk stock of men. On the other hand, the kangaroo,
summer, autumn, the wind and the shevak tree belong to the division Kroki, and are akin to
the black cockatoo stock of men. Any human member of the Kroki division has thus for his brothers
the sun, the wind, the kangaroo, and the rest; while any man of the Kumite division and the
crow surname is the brother of the rain, the thunder, and the winter. This extraordinary belief
is not a mere idle fancy--it influences conduct. "A man does not kill or use as food any of
the animals of the same subdivision (Kroki or Kumite) with himself, excepting when hunger compels,
and then they express sorrow for having to eat their wingong (friends) or tumanang (their flesh).
When using the last word they touch their breasts, to indicate the close relationship, meaning
almost a portion of themselves. To illustrate: One day one of the blacks killed a crow. This
account of the Australian beliefs and customs is borne out, to a certain extent, by the evidence
of Sir George Grey,(2) and of the late Mr. Gideon Scott Lang.(3) These two writers take no
account of the singular "dichotomous" divisions, as of Kumite and Kroki, but they draw attention
to the groups of kindred which derive their surnames from animals, plants, and the like. We
have seen from the evidence of Messrs. Fison and Howitt that a more common native explanation
is based on kinship with the vegetable or plant which bestows the family surname. Sir George
Gray mentions that the families use their plant or animal as a crest or kobong (totem), and
he adds that natives never willingly kill animals of their kobong, holding that some one of
that species is their nearest friend. The consequences of eating forbidden animals vary considerably.
Sometimes the Boyl-yas (that is, ghosts) avenge the crime. Thus when Sir George Grey ate some
mussels (which, after all, are not the crest of the Greys), a storm followed, and one of his
black fellow improvised this stave:--

     Oh, wherefore did he eat the mussels?
     Now the Boyl-yas storms and thunders make;
     Oh, wherefore would he eat the mussels?

There are two points in the arrangements of these stocks of kindred named from plants and animals
which we shall find to possess a high importance. This point is very strongly put by Mr. Dawson,
who has had much experience of the blacks. "So strictly are the laws of marriage carried out,
that, should any sign of courtship or affection be observed between those 'of one flesh,' the
brothers or male relatives of the woman beat her severely." If the incestuous pair (though
not in the least related according to our ideas) run away together, they are "half-killed";
and if the woman dies in consequence of her punishment, her partner in iniquity is beaten again.
No "eric" or blood-fine of any kind is paid for her death, which carries no blood-feud. "Her
punishment is legal."(2) This account fully corroborates that of Sir George Grey.(3)

(1) Taplin, The Nerrinyeri. p. 2. "Every tribe, regarded by them as a family, has its ngaitge,
or tutelary genius or tribal symbol, in the shape of some bird, beast, fish, reptile, insect,
or substance. Between individuals of the same tribe no marriage can take place." Among the
Narrinyeri kindred is reckoned (p. 10) on the father's side. See also (p. 46) ngaitge = Samoan
aitu. "No man or woman will kill their ngaitge," except with precautions, for food.

(2) Op. cit., p. 28.

(3) Ibid., ii. 220.

Our conclusion is that the belief in "one flesh" (a kinship shared with the animals) must be
a thoroughly binding idea, as the notion is sanctioned by capital punishment.

Another important feature in Australian totemism strengthens our position. The idea of the
animal kinship must be an ancient one in the race, because the family surname, Emu, Bandicoot,
or what not, and the crest, kobong, or protecting and kindred animal, are inherited through
the mother's side in the majority of stocks. This custom, therefore, belongs to that early
period of human society in which the woman is the permanent and recognised factor in the family
while male parentage is uncertain.(1) One other feature of Australian totemism must be mentioned
before we leave the subject. There is some evidence that in certain tribes the wingong or totem
of each man is indicated by a tattooed representation of it upon his flesh. The natives are
very licentious, but men would shrink from an amour with a woman who neither belonged to their
own district nor spoke their language, but who, in spite of that, was of their totem. To avoid
mistakes, it seems that some tribes mark the totem on the flesh with incised lines.(2) The
natives frequently design figures of some kind on the trees growing near the graves of deceased
warriors. Some observers have fancied that in these designs they recognised the totem of the
dead men; but on this subject evidence is by no means clear. We shall see that this primitive
sort of heraldry, this carving or painting of hereditary blazons, is common among the Red Men
of America.(3)

(3) Among other recent sources see Howitt in "Organisation of Australian Tribes" (Transactions
of Royal Society of Victoria, 1889), and Spencer and Gillen, Natives of Central Australia.
In Central Australia there is a marked difference in the form of Totemism.

Though a large amount of evidence might be added to that already put forward, we may now sum
up the inferences to be drawn from the study of totemism in Australia. It has been shown (1)
that the natives think themselves actually akin to animals, plants, the sun, and the wind,
and things in general; (2) that those ideas influence their conduct, and even regulate their
social arrangements, because (3) men and women of the kinship of the same animal or plant may
not intermarry, while men are obliged to defend, and in case of murder to avenge, persons of
the stock of the family or plant from which they themselves derive their family name. Thus,
on the evidence of institutions, it is plain that the Australians are (or before the influence
of the Europeans became prevalent were) in a state of mind which draws no hard and fast line
between man and the things in the world. If, therefore, we find that in Australian myth, men,
gods, beasts, and things all shift shapes incessantly, and figure in a coroboree dance of confusion,
there will be nothing to astonish us in the discovery. The myths of men in the Australian intellectual
condition, of men who hold long conversations with the little "native bear," and ask him for
oracles, will naturally and inevitably be grotesque and confused.(1)

(1) Brough Smyth, i. 447, on MS. authority of W. Thomas.

It is "a far cry" from Australia to the West Coast of Africa, and it is scarcely to be supposed
that the Australians have borrowed ideas and institutions from Ashantee, or that the people
of Ashantee have derived their conceptions of the universe from the Murri of Australia. We
find, however, on the West African Coast, just as we do in Australia, that there exist large
local divisions of the natives. These divisions are spoken of by Mr. Bowditch (who visited
the country on a mission in 1817) as nations, and they are much more populous and powerful
(as the people are more civilised) than the local tribes of Australia. Yet, just as among the
local tribes of Australia, the nations of the West African Coast are divided into stocks of
kindred, each STOCK having its representatives in each NATION. Thus an Ashantee or a Fantee
may belong to the same stock of kindred as a member of the Assin or Akini nation. When an Ashantee
of the Annona stock of kindred meets a Warsaw man of the same stock they salute and acknowledge
each other as brothers. In the same way a Ballarat man of the Kangaroo stock in Australia recognises
a relative in a Mount Gambier man who is also a Kangaroo. Now, with one exception, all the
names of the twelve stocks of West African kindreds, or at least all of them which Mr. Bowditch
could get the native interpreters to translate, are derived from animals, plants and other
natural objects, just as in Australia.(1) Thus Quonna is a buffalo, Abrootoo is a cornstalk,
Abbradi a plantain. Other names are, in English, the parrot, the wild cat, red earth, panther
and dog. Thus all the natives of this part of Africa are parrots, dogs, buffaloes, panthers,
and so forth, just as the Australians are emus, iguanas, black cockatoos, kangaroos, and the
rest. It is remarkable that there is an Incra stock, or clan of ants, in Ashantee, just as
there was a race of Myrmidons, believed to be descended from or otherwise connected with ants,
in ancient Greece. Though Bowditch's account of these West African family divisions is brief,
the arrangement tallies closely with that of Australia. It is no great stretch of imagination
to infer that the African tribes do, or once did, believe themselves to be of the kindred of
the animals whose names they bear.(2) It is more or less confirmatory of this hypothesis that
no family is permitted to use as food the animal from which it derives its name. We have seen
that a similar rule prevails, as far as hunger and scarcity of victuals permit it to be obeyed,
among the natives of Australia. The Intchwa stock in Ashantee and Fantee is particularly unlucky,
because its members may not eat the dog, "much relished by native epicures, and therefore a
serious privation". Equally to be pitied were the ancient Egyptians, who, if they belonged
to the district of the sheep, might not eat mutton, which their neighbours, the Lycopolitae,
devoured at pleasure. These restrictions appear to be connected with the almost universal dislike
of cannibals to eat persons of their own kindred except as a pious duty. This law of the game
in cannibalism has not yet been thoroughly examined, though we often hear of wars waged expressly
for the purpose of securing food (human meat), while some South American tribes actually bred
from captive women by way of securing constant supplies of permitted flesh.(3) When we find
stocks, then, which derive their names from animals and decline to eat these animals, we may
at least SUSPECT that they once claimed kinship with the name-giving beasts. The refusal to
eat them raises a presumption of such faith. Old Bosman(4) had noticed the same practices.
"One eats no mutton, another no goat's flesh, another no beef, swine's flesh, wild fowl, cocks
with white feathers, and they say their ancestors did so from the beginning of the world."

(1) The evidence of native interpreters may be viewed with suspicion. It is improbable, however,
that in 1817 the interpreters were acquainted with the totemistic theory of mythologists, and
deliberately mistranslated the names of the stocks, so as to make them harmonise with Indian,
Australian, and Red Indian totem kindreds. This, indeed, is an example where the criterion
of "recurrence" or "coincidence" seems to be valuable. Bowditch's Mission to Ashantee (1873),
p. 181.

(2) This view, however, does not prevail among the totemistic tribes of British Columbia, for
example.

(3) Cieza de Leon (Hakluyt Society), p. 50. This amazing tale is supported by the statement
that kinship went by the female side (p. 49); the father was thus not of the kin of his child
by the alien woman. Cieza was with Validillo in 1538.

While in the case of the Ashantee tribes, we can only infer the existence of a belief in kinship
with the animals from the presence of the other features of fully developed totemism (especially
from the refusal to eat the name-giving animal), we have direct evidence for the opinion in
another part of Africa, among the Bechuanas.(1) Casalis, who passed twenty-three years as a
missionary in South Africa, thus describes the institution: "While the united communities usually
bear the name of their chief or of the district which they inhabit" (local tribes, as in Australia),
"each stock (tribu) derives its title from an animal or a vegetable. All the Bechuanas are
subdivided thus into Bakuenas (crocodile-men), Batlapis (men of the fish), Banarer (of the
buffalo), Banukus (porcupines), Bamoraras (wild vines), and so forth. The Bakuenas call the
crocodile their father, sing about him in their feasts, swear by him, and mark the ears of
their cattle with an incision which resembles the open jaws of the creature." This custom of
marking the cattle with the crest, as it were, of the stock, takes among some races the shape
of deforming themselves, so as the more to resemble the animal from which they claim descent.
"The chief of the family which holds the chief rank in the stock is called 'The Great Man of
the Crocodile'. Precisely in the same way the Duchess of Sutherland is styled in Gaelic 'The
Great Lady of the Cat,'" though totemism is probably not the origin of this title.

(1) E. Casalis, Les Bassoutos, 1859.

Casalis proceeds: "No one would dare to eat the flesh or wear the skin of the animal whose
name he bears. If the animal be dangerous--the lion, for example--people only kill him after
offering every apology and asking his pardon. Purification must follow such a sacrifice." Casalis
was much struck with the resemblance between these practices and the similar customs of North
American races. Livingstone's account(1) on the whole corroborates that of Casalis, though
he says the Batau (tribe of the lion) no longer exists. "They use the word bina 'to dance,'
in reference to the custom of thus naming themselves, so that when you wish to ascertain what
tribe they belong to, you say, 'What do you dance?' It would seem as if this had been part
of the worship of old." The mythological and religious knowledge of the Bushmen is still imparted
in dances; and when a man is ignorant of some myth he will say, "I do not dance that dance,"
meaning that he does not belong to the guild which preserves that particular "sacred chapter".(2)

(2) Orpen, Cape Monthly Magazine, 1872.

Casalis noticed the similarity between South African and Red Indian opinion about kinship with
vegetables and beasts. The difficulty in treating the Red Indian belief is chiefly found in
the abundance of the evidence. Perhaps the first person who ever used the word "totemism,"
or, as he spells it, "totamism," was (as we said) Mr. Long, an interpreter among the Chippeways,
who published his Voyages in 1791. Long was not wholly ignorant of the languages, as it was
his business to speak them, and he was an adopted Indian. The ceremony of adoption was painful,
beginning with a feast of dog's flesh, followed by a Turkish bath and a prolonged process of
tattooing.(1) According to Long,(2) "The totam, they conceive, assumes the form of some beast
or other, and therefore they never kill, hurt, or eat the animal whose form they think this
totam bears". One man was filled with religious apprehensions, and gave himself up to the gloomy
belief of Bunyan and Cowper, that he had committed the unpardonable sin, because he dreamed
he had killed his totem, a bear.(3) This is only one example, like the refusal of the Osages
to kill the beavers, with which they count cousins,(4) that the Red Man's belief is an actual
creed, and does influence his conduct.

As in Australia, the belief in common kin with beasts is most clearly proved by the construction
of Red Indian society. The "totemistic" stage of thought and manners prevails. Thus Charlevoix
says,(1) "Plusieurs nations ont chacune trois familles ou tribus principales, AUSSI ANCIENNES,
A CE QU'IL PAROIT, QUE LEUR ORIGINE. Chaque tribu porte le nom d'un animal, et la nation entiere
a aussi le sien, dont elle prend le nom, et dont la figure est sa marque, ou, se l'on veut,
ses armoiries, on ne signe point autrement les traites qu'en traceant ces figures." Among the
animal totems Charlevoix notices porcupine, bear, wolf and turtle. The armoiries, the totemistic
heraldry of the peoples of Virginia, greatly interested a heraldic ancestor of Gibbon the historian,(2)
who settled in the colony. According to Schoolcraft,(3) the totem or family badge, of a dead
warrior is drawn in a reverse position on his grave-post. In the same way the leopards of England
are drawn reversed on the shield of an English king opposite the mention of his death in old
monkish chronicles. As a general rule,(4) persons bearing the same totem in America cannot
intermarry. "The union must be between various totems." Moreover, as in the case of the Australians,
"the descent of the chief is in the female line". We thus find among the Red Men precisely
the same totemistic regulations as among the Aborigines of Australia. Like the Australians,
the Red Men "never" (perhaps we should read "hardly ever") eat their totems. Totemists, in
short, spare the beasts that are their own kith and kin. To avoid multiplying details which
all corroborate each other, it may suffice to refer to Schoolcraft for totemism among the Iowas(5)
and the Pueblos;(6) for the Iroquois, to Lafitau, a missionary of the early part of the eighteenth
century. Lafitau was perhaps the first writer who ever explained certain features in Greek
and other ancient myths and practices as survivals from totemism. The Chimera, a composite
creature, lion, goat and serpent, might represent, Lafitau thought, a league of three totem
tribes, just as wolf, bear and turtle represented the Iroquois League.

The martyred Pere Rasles, again, writing in 1723,(1) says that one stock of the Outaonaks claims
descent from a hare ("the great hare was a man of prodigious size"), while another stock derive
their lineage from the carp, and a third descends from a bear; yet they do not scruple, after
certain expiatory rites, to eat bear's flesh. Other North American examples are the Kutchin,
who have always possessed the system of totems.(2)

It is to be noticed, as a peculiarity of Red Indian totemism which we have not observed (though
it may exist) in Africa, that certain stocks claim relations with the sun. Thus Pere Le Petit,
writing from New Orleans in 1730, mentions the Sun, or great chief of the Natchez Indians.(1)
The totem of the privileged class among the Natchez was the sun, and in all myths the sun is
regarded as a living being, who can have children, who may be beaten, who bleeds when cut,
and is simply on the same footing as men and everything else in the world. Precisely similar
evidence comes from South America. In this case our best authority is almost beyond suspicion.
He knew the native languages well, being himself a half-caste. He was learned in the European
learning of his time; and as a son of the Incas, he had access to all surviving Peruvian stores
of knowledge, and could collect without difficulty the testimonies of his countrymen. It will
be seen(2) that Don Garcilasso de la Vega could estimate evidence, and ridiculed the rough
methods and fallacious guesses of Spanish inquirers. Garcilasso de la Vega was born about 1540,
being the son of an Inca princess and of a Spanish conqueror. His book, Commentarias Reales,(3)
was expressly intended to rectify the errors of such Spanish writers as Acosta. In his account
of Peruvian religion, Garcilasso distinguishes between the beliefs of the tribes previous to
the rise of the Inca empire and the sun-worship of the Incas. But it is plain, from Garcilasso's
own account and from other evidence, that under the Incas the older faiths and fetichisms survived,
in subordination to sun-worship, just as Pagan superstitions survived in custom and folk-lore
after the official recognition of Christianity. Sun-worship, in Peru, and the belief in a Supreme
Creator there, seem even, like Catholicism in Mexico, China and elsewhere, to have made a kind
of compromise with the lower beliefs, and to have been content to allow a certain amount of
bowing down in the temples of the elder faiths. Men offered up to their totems "what they usually
saw them eat".(6) On the seacoasts "they worshipped sardines, skates, dog-fish, and, for want
of larger gods, crabs.... There was not an animal, how vile and filthy soever, that they did
not worship as a god," including "lizards, toads and frogs." Garcilasso (who says they ate
the fish they worshipped) gives his own theory of the origin of totemism. In the beginning
men had only sought for badges whereby to discriminate one human stock from another. "The one
desired to have a god different from the other.... They only thought of making one different
from another." When the Inca emperors began to civilise the totemistic stocks, they pointed
out that their own father, the sun, possessed "splendour and beauty" as contrasted with "the
ugliness and filth of the frogs and other vermin they looked upon as gods".(7) Garcilasso,
of course, does not use the North American word totem (or ote or otem) for the family badge
which represented the family ancestors. He calls these things, as a general rule, pacarissa.
The sun was the pacarissa of the Incas, as it was of the chief of the Natchez. The pacarissa
of other stocks was the lion, bear, frog, or what not. Garcilasso accounts for the belief accorded
to the Incas, when they claimed actual descent from the sun, by observing(8) that "there were
tribes among their subjects who professed similar fabulous descents, though they did not comprehend
how to select ancestors so well as the Incas, but adored animals and other low and earthly
objects". As to the fact of the Peruvian worship of beasts, if more evidence is wanted, it
is given, among others, by Cieza de Leon,(9) who contrasts the adoration of the Roman gods
with that offered in Peru to brutes. "In the important temple of Pacha-camac (the spiritual
deity of Peru) they worshipped a she-fox or vixen and an emerald." The devil also "appeared
to them and spoke in the form of a tiger, very fierce". Other examples of totemism in South
America may be studied in the tribes on the Amazon.(10) Mr. Wallace found the Pineapple stock,
the Mosquitoes, Woodpeckers, Herons, and other totem kindreds. A curious example of similar
ideas is discovered among the Bonis of Guiana. These people were originally West Coast Africans
imported as slaves, who have won their freedom with the sword. While they retain a rough belief
in Gadou (God) and Didibi (the devil), they are divided into totem stocks with animal names.
The red ape, turtle and cayman are among the chief totems.(11)

After this hasty examination of the confused belief in kinship with animals and other natural
objects which underlies institutions in Australia, West and South Africa, North and South America,
we may glance at similar notions among the non-Aryan races of India. In Dalton's Ethnology
of Bengal,(1) he tells us that the Garo clans are divided into maharis or motherhoods. Children
belong to the mahari of the mother, just as (in general) they derive their stock name and totem
from the mother's side in Australia and among the North American Indians. No man may marry
(as among the Red Indians and Australians) a woman belonging to his own stock, motherhood or
mahari. So far the maharis of Bengal exactly correspond to the totem kindred. But do the Maharis
also take their names from plants and animals, and so forth? We know that the Killis, similar
communities among the Bengal Hos and Mundos, do this.(2) "The Mundaris, like the Oraons, adopt
as their tribal distinction the name of some animal, and the flesh of that animal is tabooed
to them as food; for example, the eel, the tortoise." This is exactly the state of things in
Ashanti. Dalton mentions also(3) a princely family in Nagpur which claims descent from "a great
hooded snake". Among the Oraons he found(4) tribes which might not eat young mice (considered
a dainty) or tortoises, and a stock which might not eat the oil of the tree which was their
totem, nor even sit in its shade. "The family or tribal names" (within which they may not marry)
"are usually those of animals or plants, and when this is the case, the flesh of some part
of the animal or the fruit of the tree is tabooed to the tribe called after it."

An excellent sketch of totemism in India is given by Mr. H. H. Risley of the Bengal Civil Service:--(1)

(1) The Asiatic Quarterly, No. 3, Essay on "Primitive Marriage in Bengal."

"At the bottom of the social system, as understood by the average Hindu, stands a large body
of non-Aryan castes and tribes, each of which is broken up into a number of what may be called
totemistic exogamous septs. Each sept bears the name of an animal, a tree, a plant, or of some
material object, natural or artificial, which the members of that sept are prohibited from
killing, eating, cutting, burning, carrying, using, etc."(1)

(1) Here we may note that the origin of exogamy itself is merely part of a strict totemistic
prohibition. A man may not "use" an object within the totem kin, nor a woman of the kin. Compare
the Greek idiom (Greek text omitted).

Mr. Risley finds that both Kolarians, as the Sonthals, and Dravidians, as the Oraons, are in
this state of totemism, like the Hos and Mundas. It is most instructive to learn that, as one
of these tribes rises in the social scale, it sloughs off its totem, and, abandoning the common
name derived from bird, beast, or plant, adopts that of an eponymous ancestor. A tendency in
this direction has been observed by Messrs. Fison and Howitt even in Australia. The Mahilis,
Koras and Kurmis, who profess to be members of the Hindu community, still retain the totemistic
organisation, with names derived from birds, beasts and plants. Even the Jagannathi Kumhars
of Orissa, taking rank immediately below the writer-caste, have the totems tiger, snake, weasel,
cow, frog, sparrow and tortoise. The sub-castes of the Khatlya Kumhars explain away their totem-names
"as names of certain saints, who, being present at Daksha's Horse-sacrifice, transformed themselves
into animals to escape the wrath of Siva," like the gods of Egypt when they fled in bestial
form from the wrath of Set.

Among the non-Aryan tribes the marriage law has the totemistic sanction. No man may marry a
woman of his totem kin. When the totem-name is changed for an eponym, the non-Aryan, rising
in the social scale, is practically in the same position as the Brahmans, "divided into exogamous
sections (gotras), the members of which profess to be descended from the mythical rishi or
inspired saint whose name the gotra bears". There is thus nothing to bar the conjecture that
the exogamous gotras of the whole Brahmans were once a form of totem-kindred, which (like aspiring
non-Aryan stocks at the present day) dropped the totem-name and renamed the septs from some
eponymous hero, medicine-man, or Rishi.

Constant repetition of the same set of facts becomes irksome, and yet is made necessary by
the legitimate demand for trustworthy and abundant evidence. As the reader must already have
reflected, this living mythical belief in the common confused equality of men, gods, plants,
beasts, rivers, and what not, which still regulates savage society,(1) is one of the most prominent
features in mythology. Porphyry remarked and exactly described it among the Egyptians--"common
and akin to men and gods they believed the beasts to be."(2) The belief in such equality is
alien to modern civilisation. We have shown that it is common and fundamental in savagery.
For instance, in the Pacific, we might quote Turner,(3) and for Melanesia, Codrington,(4) while
for New Zealand we have Taylor.(5) For the Jakuts, along the banks of the Lena in Northern
Asia, we have the evidence of Strahlenberg, who writes: "Each tribe of these people look upon
some particular creature as sacred, e.g., a swan, goose, raven, etc., and such is not eaten
by that tribe" though the others may eat it.(6) As the majority of our witnesses were quite
unaware that the facts they described were common among races of whom many of them had never
even heard, their evidence may surely be accepted as valid, especially as the beliefs testified
to express themselves in marriage laws, in the blood-feud, in abstinence from food, on pillars
over graves, in rude heraldry, and in other obvious and palpable shapes. If we have not made
out, by the evidence of institutions, that a confused credulity concerning the equality and
kinship of man and the objects in nature is actually a ruling belief among savages, and even
higher races, from the Lena to the Amazon, from the Gold Coast to Queensland, we may despair
of ever convincing an opponent. The survival of the same beliefs and institutions among civilised
races, Aryan and others, will later be demonstrated.(7) If we find that the mythology of civilised
races here agrees with the actual practical belief of savages, and if we also find that civilised
races retain survivals of the institutions in which the belief is expressed by savages, then
we may surely infer that the activity of beasts in the myths of Greece springs from the same
sources as the similar activity of beasts in the myths of Iroquois or Kaffirs. That is to say,
part of the irrational element in Greek myth will be shown to be derived (whether by inheritance
or borrowing) from an ascertained condition of savage fancy.

The second feature in the savage intellectual condition which we promised to investigate was
the belief in magic and sorcery. The world and all the things in it being conceived of vaguely
as sensible and rational, are supposed to obey the commands of certain members of each tribe,
such as chiefs, jugglers, or conjurors. These conjurors, like Zeus or Indra, can affect the
weather, work miracles, assume what shapes, animal, vegetable, or inorganic, they please, and
can metamorphose other persons into similar shapes. It has already been shown that savage man
has regarded all THINGS as PERSONS much on a level with himself. It has now to be shown WHAT
KIND OF PERSON HE CONCEIVES HIMSELF TO BE. He does not look on men as civilised races regard
them, that is, as beings with strict limitations. On the other hand, he thinks of certain members
of his tribe as exempt from most of the limitations, and capable of working every miracle that
tradition has ever attributed to prophets or gods. Nor are such miraculous powers, such practical
omnipotence, supposed by savages to be at all rare among themselves. Though highly valued,
miraculous attainments are not believed to be unusual. This must be kept steadily in mind.
When myth-making man regards the sky or sun or wind as a person, he does not mean merely a
person with the limitations recognised by modern races. He means a person with the miraculous
powers of the medicine-man. The sky, sun, wind or other elemental personage can converse with
the dead, and can turn himself and his neighbours into animals, stones and trees.

To understand these functions and their exercise, it is necessary to examine what may be called
savage science, savage metaphysics, and the savage theory of the state of the dead. The medicine-man's
supernatural claims are rooted in the general savage view of the world, of what is possible,
and of what (if anything) is impossible. The savage, even more than the civilised man, may
be described as a creature "moving about in worlds not realised". He feels, no less than civilised
man, the need of making the world intelligible, and he is active in his search for causes and
effects. There is much "speculation in these eyes that he doth glare withal". This is a statement
which has been denied by some persons who have lived with savages. Thus Mr. Bates, in his Naturalist
on the Amazon,(1) writes: "Their want of curiosity is extreme.... Vicente (an Indian companion)
did not know the cause of thunder and lightning. But Mr. Bates admits that even Vicente had
a theory of the configuration of the world. "The necessity of a theory of the earth and water
had been felt, and a theory had been suggested." Again, Mr. Bates says about a certain Brazilian
tribe, "Their sluggish minds seem unable to conceive or feel the want of a theory of the soul";
and he thinks the cause of this indolence is the lack "of a written language or a leisured
class". Now savages, as a rule, are all in the "leisured class," all sportsmen. Mr. Herbert
Spencer, too, has expressed scepticism about the curiosity attributed to savages. The point
is important, because, in our view, the medicine-man's powers are rooted in the savage theory
of things, and if the savage is too sluggish to invent or half consciously evolve a theory
of things, our hypothesis is baseless. Again, we expect to find in savage myths the answer
given by savages to their own questions. But this view is impossible if savages do not ask
themselves, and never have asked themselves, any questions at all about the world. On this
topic Mr. Spencer writes: "Along with absence of surprise there naturally goes absence of intelligent
curiosity".(2) Yet Mr. Spencer admits that, according to some witnesses, "the Dyaks have an
insatiable curiosity," the Samoans "are usually very inquisitive," and "the Tahitians are remarkably
curious and inquisitive". Nothing is more common than to find travellers complaining that savages,
in their ardently inquiring curiosity, will not leave the European for a moment to his own
undisturbed devices. Mr. Spencer's savages, who showed no curiosity, displayed this impassiveness
when Europeans were trying to make them exhibit signs of surprise. Impassivity is a point of
honour with many uncivilised races, and we cannot infer that a savage has no curiosity because
he does not excite himself over a mirror, or when his European visitors try to swagger with
their mechanical appliances. Mr. Herbert Spencer founds, on the statements of Mr. Bates already
quoted, a notion that "the savage, lacking ability to think and the accompanying desire to
know, is without tendency to speculate". He backs Mr. Bates's experience with Mungo Park's
failure to "draw" the negroes about the causes of day and night. They had never indulged a
conjecture nor formed an hypothesis on the matter. Yet Park avers that "the belief in one God
is entire and universal among them". This he "pronounces without the smallest shadow of doubt".
As to "primitive man," according to Mr. Spencer, "the need for explanations about surrounding
appearances does not occur to him". We have disclaimed all knowledge about "primitive man,"
but it is easy to show that Mr. Spencer grounds his belief in the lack of speculation among
savages on a frail foundation of evidence.

(1) Vol. ii. p. 162.

(2) Sociology, p. 98.

Mr. Spencer has admitted speculation, or at least curiosity, among New Caledonians, New Guinea
people, Dyaks, Samoans and Tahitians. Even where he denies its existence, as among the Amazon
tribes mentioned by Mr. Bates, we happen to be able to show that Mr. Bates was misinformed.
Another traveller, the American geologist, Professor Hartt of Cornell University, lived long
among the tribes of the Amazon. But Professor Hartt did not, like Mr. Bates, find them at all
destitute of theories of things--theories expressed in myths, and testifying to the intellectual
activity and curiosity which demands an answer to its questions. Professor Hartt, when he first
became acquainted with the Indians of the Amazon, knew that they were well supplied with myths,
and he set to work to collect them. But he found that neither by coaxing nor by offers of money
could he persuade an Indian to relate a myth. Only by accident, "while wearily paddling up
the Paranamirim of the Ituki," did he hear the steersman telling stories to the oarsmen to
keep them awake. Professor Hartt furtively noted down the tale, and he found that by "setting
the ball rolling," and narrating a story himself, he could make the natives throw off reserve
and add to his stock of tales. "After one has obtained his first myth, and has learned to recite
it accurately and spiritedly, the rest is easy." The tales published by Professor Hartt are
chiefly animal stories, like those current in Africa and among the Red Indians, and Hartt even
believed that many of the legends had been imported by Negroes. But as the majority of the
Negro myths, like those of the Australians, give a "reason why" for the existence of some phenomenon
or other, the argument against early man's curiosity and vivacity of intellect is rather injured,
even if the Amazonian myths were imported from Africa. Mr. Spencer based his disbelief in the
intellectual curiosity of the Amazonian tribes and of Negroes on the reports of Mr. Bates and
of Mungo Park. But it turns out that both Negroes and Amazonians have stories which do satisfy
an unscientific curiosity, and it is even held that the Negroes lent the Amazonians these very
stories.(1) The Kamschadals, according to Steller, "give themselves a reason why for everything,
according to their own lively fancy, and do not leave the smallest matter uncriticised".(2)
As far, then, as Mr. Spencer's objections apply to existing savages, we may consider them overweighed
by the evidence, and we may believe in a naive savage curiosity about the world and desire
for explanations of the causes of things. Mr. Tylor's opinion corroborates our own: "Man's
craving to know the causes at work in each event he witnesses, the reasons why each state of
things he surveys is such as it is and no other, is no product of high civilisation, but a
characteristic of his race down to its lowest stages. Among rude savages it is already an intellectual
appetite, whose satisfaction claims many of the moments not engrossed by war or sport, food
or sleep. Even in the Botocudo or the Australian, scientific speculation has its germ in actual
experience."(3) It will be shown later that the food of the savage intellectual appetite is
offered and consumed in the shape of explanatory myths.

(1) See Amazonian Tortoise-Myth., pp. 5, 37, 40; and compare Mr. Harris's Preface to Nights
with Uncle Remus.

(3) Primitive Culture, i. 369.

But we must now observe that the "actual experience," properly so called, of the savage is
so limited and so coloured by misconception and superstition, that his knowledge of the world
varies very much from the conceptions of civilised races. He seeks an explanation, a theory
of things, based on his experience. But his knowledge of physical causes and of natural laws
is exceedingly scanty, and he is driven to fall back upon what we may call metaphysical, or,
in many cases "supernatural" explanations. The narrower the range of man's knowledge of physical
causes, the wider is the field which he has to fill up with hypothetical causes of a metaphysical
or "supernatural" character. These "supernatural" causes themselves the savage believes to
be matters of experience. It is to his mind a matter of experience that all nature is personal
and animated; that men may change shapes with beasts; that incantations and supernatural beings
can cause sunshine and storm.

A good example of this is given in Charlevoix's work on French Canada.(1) Charlevoix was a
Jesuit father and missionary among the Hurons and other tribes of North America. He thus describes
the philosophy of the Red Men: "The Hurons attribute the most ordinary effects to supernatural
causes".(2) In the same page the good father himself attributes the welcome arrival of rainy
weather and the cure of certain savage patients to the prayers of Pere Brebeuf and to the exhibition
of the sacraments. Charlevoix had considerably extended the field in which natural effects
are known to be produced by natural causes. He was much more scientifically minded than his
savage flock, and was quite aware that an ordinary clock with a pendulum cannot bring bad luck
to a whole tribe, and that a weather-cock is not a magical machine for securing unpleasant
weather. The Hurons, however, knowing less of natural causes and nothing of modern machinery,
were as convinced that his clock was ruining the luck of the tribe and his weather-cock spoiling
the weather, as Father Charlevoix could be of the truth of his own inferences. One or two other
anecdotes in the good father's history and letters help to explain the difference between the
philosophies of wild and of Christian men. The Pere Brebeuf was once summoned at the instigation
of a Huron wizard or "medicine-man" before a council of the tribe. His judges told the father
that nothing had gone right since he appeared among them. To this Brebeuf replied by "drawing
the attention of the savages to the absurdity of their principles". He admitted(3) the premise
that nothing had turned out well in the tribe since his arrival. "But the reason," said he,
"plainly is that God is angry with your hardness of heart." No sooner had the good father thus
demonstrated the absurdity of savage principles of reasoning, than the malignant Huron wizard
fell down dead at his feet! This event naturally added to the confusion of the savages.

Coincidences of this sort have a great effect on savage minds. Catlin, the friend of the Mandan
tribe, mentions a chief who consolidated his power by aid of a little arsenic, bought from
the whites. The chief used to prophesy the sudden death of his opponents, which always occurred
at the time indicated. The natural results of the administration of arsenic were attributed
by the barbarous people to supernatural powers in the possession of the chief.(1) Thus the
philosophy of savages seeks causas cognoscere rerum, like the philosophy of civilised men,
but it flies hastily to a hypothesis of "supernatural" causes which are only guessed at, and
are incapable of demonstration. This frame of mind prevails still in civilised countries, as
the Bishop of Nantes showed when, in 1846, he attributed the floods of the Loire to "the excesses
of the press and the general disregard of Sunday". That "supernatural" causes exist and may
operate, it is not at all our intention to deny. But the habit of looking everywhere for such
causes, and of assuming their interference at will, is the main characteristic of savage speculation.
The peculiarity of the savage is that he thinks human agents can work supernaturally, whereas
even the Bishop reserved his supernatural explanations for the Deity. On this belief in man's
power to affect events beyond the limits of natural possibility is based the whole theory of
MAGIC, the whole power of sorcerers. That theory, again, finds incessant expression in myth,
and therefore deserves our attention.

(1) Catlin, Letters, ii. 117.

The theory requires for its existence an almost boundless credulity. This credulity appears
to Europeans to prevail in full force among savages. Bosman is amazed by the African belief
that a spider created the world. Moffat is astonished at the South African notion that the
sea was accidentally created by a girl. Charlevoix says, "Les sauvages sont d'une facilite
a croire ce qu'on leur dit, que les plus facheuse experiences n'ont jamais pu guerir".(1) But
it is a curious fact that while savages are, as a rule, so credulous, they often laugh at the
religious doctrines taught them by missionaries. Elsewhere they recognise certain essential
doctrines as familiar forms of old. Dr. Moffat remarks, "To speak of the Creation, the Fall
and the Resurrection, seemed more fabulous, extravagant and ludicrous to them than their own
vain stories of lions and hyaenas." Again, "The Gospel appeared too preposterous for the most
foolish to believe".(2) While the Zulus declared that they used to accept their own myths without
inquiry,(3) it was a Zulu who suggested to Bishop Colenso his doubts about the historical character
of the Noachian Deluge. Hearne(4) knew a Red Man, Matorabhee, who, "though a perfect bigot
with regard to the arts and tricks of the jugglers, could yet by no means be impressed with
a belief of any part of OUR religion". Lieutenant Haggard, R.N., tells the writer that during
an eclipse at Lamoo he ridiculed the native notion of driving away a beast which devours the
moon, and explained the real cause of the phenomenon. But his native friend protested that
"he could not be expected to believe such a story". Yet other savages aver an old agreement
with the belief in a moral Creator.

We have already seen sufficient examples of credulity in savage doctrines about the equal relations
of men and beasts, stars, clouds and plants. The same readiness of belief, which would be surprising
in a Christian child, has been found to regulate the rudimentary political organisations of
grey barbarians. Add to this credulity a philosophy which takes resemblance, or contiguity
in space, or nearness in time as a sufficient reason for predicating the relations of cause
and effect, and we have the basis of savage physical science. Yet the metaphysical theories
of savages, as expressed in Maori, Polynesian, and Zuni hymns, often amaze us by their wealth
of abstract ideas. Coincidence elsewhere stands for cause.

Post hoc, ergo propter hoc, is the motto of the savage philosophy of causation. The untutored
reasoner speculates on the principles of the Egyptian clergy, as described by Herodotus.(1)
"The Egyptians have discovered more omens and prodigies than any other men; for when aught
prodigious occurs, they keep good watch, and write down what follows; and then, if anything
like the prodigy be repeated, they expect the same events to follow as before." This way of
looking at things is the very essence of superstition.

(1) II. p. 82.

Savages, as a rule, are not even so scientific as the Egyptians. When an untoward event occurs,
they look for its cause among all the less familiar circumstances of the last few days, and
select the determining cause very much at random. Thus the arrival of the French missionaries
among the Hurons was coincident with certain unfortunate events; therefore it was argued that
the advent of the missionaries was the cause of the misfortune. When the Bechuanas suffered
from drought, they attributed the lack of rain to the arrival of Dr. Moffat, and especially
to his beard, his church bell, and a bag of salt in his possession. Here there was not even
the pretence of analogy between cause and effect. Some savages might have argued (it is quite
in their style), that as salt causes thirst, a bag of salt causes drought; but no such case
could be made out against Dr. Moffat's bell and beard. To give an example from the beliefs
of English peasants. When a cottage was buried by a little avalanche in 1772, the accident
was attributed to the carelessness of the cottagers, who had allowed a light to be taken out
of their dwelling in Christmas-tide.(1) We see the same confusion between antecedence and consequence
in time on one side, and cause and effect on the other, when the Red Indians aver that birds
actually bring winds and storms or fair weather. They take literally the sense of the Rhodian
swallow-song:--

     The swallow hath come,
     Bringing fair hours,
     Bringing fair seasons,
     On black back and white breast.(2)

Again, in the Pacific the people of one island always attribute hurricanes to the machinations
of the people of the nearest island to windward. The wind comes from them; therefore (as their
medicine-men can notoriously influence the weather), they must have sent the wind. This unneighbourly
act is a casus belli, and through the whole of a group of islands the banner of war, like the
flag of freedom in Byron, flies against the wind. The chief principle, then, of savage science
is that antecedence and consequence in time are the same as effect and cause.(1) Again, savage
science holds that LIKE AFFECTS LIKE, that you can injure a man, for example, by injuring his
effigy. On these principles the savage explains the world to himself, and on these principles
he tries to subdue to himself the world. Now the putting of these principles into practice
is simply the exercise of art magic, an art to which nothing seems impossible. The belief that
his Shamans or medicine-men practise this art is universal among savages. It seriously affects
their conduct, and is reflected in their myths.

(1) See account of Zuni metaphysics in chapter on American Divine Myths.

The one general rule which governs all magical reasoning is, that casual connection in thought
is equivalent to causative connection in fact. Like suggests like to human thought by association
of ideas; wherefore like influences like, or produces analogous effects in practice. Any object
once in a man's possession, especially his hair or his nails, is supposed to be capable of
being used against him by a sorcerer. The part suggests the whole. A lock of a man's hair was
part of the man; to destroy the hair is to destroy its former owner. Again, whatever event
follows another in time suggests it, and may have been caused by it. Accompanying these ideas
is the belief that nature is peopled by invisible spiritual powers, over which magicians and
sorcerers possess influence. The magic of the lower races chiefly turns on these two beliefs.
First, "man having come to associate in thought those things which he found by experience to
be connected in fact, proceeded erroneously to invert their action, and to conclude that association
in thought must involve similar connection in reality. He thus attempted to discover, to foretell,
and to cause events, by means of processes which we now see to have only an ideal significance."(1)
Secondly, man endeavoured to make disembodied spirits of the dead, or any other spirits, obedient
to his will. Savage philosophy presumes that the beliefs are correct, and that their practical
application is successful. Examples of the first of the two chief magical ideas are as common
in unscientific modern times or among unscientific modern people as in the savage world.

(1) Primitive Culture, i. 14.

The physicians of the age of Charles II. were wont to give their patients "mummy powder," that
is, pulverised mummy. They argued that the mummy had lasted for a very long time, and that
the patients ought to do so likewise. Pliny imagined that diamonds must be found in company
with gold, because these are the most perfect substances in the world, and like should draw
to like. Among savages the belief that like is caused by like is exemplified in very many practices.
The New Caledonians, when they wish their yam plots to be fertile, bury in them with mystic
ceremonies certain stones which are naturally shaped like yams. The Melanesians have reduced
this kind of magic to a system. Among them certain stones have a magical efficacy, which is
determined in each case by the shape of the stone. "A stone in the shape of a pig, of a bread-fruit,
of a yam, was a most valuable find. No garden was planted without the stones which were to
increase the crop."(1) Stones with a rude resemblance to beasts bring the Zuni luck in the chase.

(1) Rev. R. H. Codrington, Journ. Anth. Inst., February, 1881.

The spiritual theory in some places is mixed up with the "like to like" theory, and the magical
stones are found where the spirits have been heard twittering and whistling. "A large stone
lying with a number of small ones under it, like a sow among her sucklings, was good for a
childless woman."(1) It is the savage belief that stones reproduce their species, a belief
consonant with the general theory of universal animation and personality. The ancient belief
that diamonds gendered diamonds is a survival from these ideas. "A stone with little disks
upon it was good to bring in money; any fanciful interpretation of a mark was enough to give
a character to the stone and its associated Vui" or spirit in Melanesia. In Scotland, stones
shaped like various parts of the human body are expected to cure the diseases with which these
members may be afflicted. "These stones were called by the names of the limbs which they represented,
as 'eye-stone,' 'head-stone'." The patient washed the affected part of the body, and rubbed
it well with the stone corresponding.(2)

To return from European peasant-magic to that of savages, we find that when the Bushmen want
wet weather they light fires, believing that the black smoke clouds will attract black rain
clouds; while the Zulus sacrifice black cattle to attract black clouds of rain.(1) Though this
magic has its origin in savage ignorance, it survives into civilisation. Thus the sacrifices
of the Vedic age were imitations of the natural phenomena which the priests desired to produce.(2)
"C'etait un moyen de faire tombre la pluie en realisant, par les representations terrestres
des eaux du nuage et de l'eclair, les conditions dans lesquelles celui-ci determine dans le
ciel l'epanchement de celles-la." A good example of magical science is afforded by the medical
practice of the Dacotahs of North America.(3) When any one is ill, an image of his disease,
a boil or what not, is carved in wood. This little image is then placed in a bowl of water
and shot at with a gun. The image of the disease being destroyed, the disease itself is expected
to disappear. Compare the magic of the Philistines, who made golden images of the sores which
plagued them and stowed them away in the ark.(4) The custom of making a wax statuette of an
enemy, and piercing it with pins or melting it before the fire, so that the detested person
might waste as his semblance melted, was common in mediaeval Europe, was known to Plato, and
is practised by Negroes. Some Australians take some of the hair of an enemy, mix it with grease
and the feathers of the eagle, and burn it in the fire. This is "bar" or black magic. The boarding
under the chair of a magistrate in Barbadoes was lifted not long ago, and the ground beneath
was found covered with wax images of litigants stuck full of pins.

The war-magic of the Dacotahs works in a similar manner. Before a party starts on the war-trail,
the chief, with various ceremonies, takes his club and stands before his tent. An old witch
bowls hoops at him; each hoop represents an enemy, and for each he strikes a foeman is expected
to fall. A bowl of sweetened water is also set out to entice the spirits of the enemy.(1) The
war-magic of the Aryans in India does not differ much in character from that of the Dacotahs.
"If any one wishes his army to be victorious, he should go beyond the battle-line, cut a stalk
of grass at the top and end, and throw it against the hostile army with the words, Prasahe
kas trapasyati?--O Prasaha, who sees thee? If one who has such knowledge cuts a stalk of grass
and throws the parts at the hostile army, it becomes split and dissolved, just as a daughter-in-law
becomes abashed and faints when seeing her father-in-law,"--an allusion, apparently, to the
widespread tabu which makes fathers-in-law, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, and mothers-in-law
avoid each other.(2)

The hunt-dances of the Red Indians and Australians are arranged like their war-magic. Effigies
of the bears, deer, or kangaroos are made, or some of the hunters imitate the motions of these
animals. The rest of the dancers pretend to spear them, and it is hoped that this will ensure
success among the real bears and kangaroos.

Here is a singular piece of magic in which Europeans and Australian blacks agree. On another
occasion a native told Mr. Howitt that he had seen black fellows putting poison in his foot-tracks.
Bosman mentions a similar practice among the people of Guinea. In Scottish folk-lore a screw
nail is fixed into the footprint of the person who is to be injured.

Just as these magical efforts to influence like by like work their way into Vedic and other
religions, so they are introduced into the religion of the savage. His prayers are addresses
to some sort of superior being, but the efficacy of the prayer is often eked out by a little
magic, unless indeed we prefer to suppose that the words of the supplication are interpreted
by gesture-speech. Sproat writes: "Set words and gestures are used according to the thing desired.
For instance, in praying for salmon, the native rubs the backs of his hands, looks upwards,
and mutters the words, 'Many salmon, many salmon'. If he wishes for deer, he carefully rubs
both eyes; or, if it is geese, he rubs the back of his shoulder, uttering always in a sing-song
way the accustomed formula.... All these practices in praying no doubt have a meaning. We may
see a steady hand is needed in throwing the salmon-spear, and clear eyesight in finding deer
in the forest."(1)

(1) Savage Life, p. 208.

In addition to these forms of symbolical magic (which might be multiplied to any extent), we
find among savages the belief in the power of songs of INCANTATION. This is a feature of magic
which specially deserves our attention. In myths, and still more in marchen or household tales,
we shall constantly find that the most miraculous effects are caused when the hero pronounces
a few lines of rhyme. In Rome, as we have all read in the Latin Delectus, it was thought that
incantations could draw down the moon. In the Odyssey the kinsfolk of Odysseus sing "a song
of healing" over the wound which was dealt him by the boar's tusk. Jeanne d'Arc, wounded at
Orleans, refused a similar remedy. Sophocles speaks of the folly of muttering incantations
over wounds that need the surgeon's knife. The song that salved wounds occurs in the Kalewala,
the epic poem of the Finns. In many of Grimm's marchen, miracles are wrought by the repetition
of snatches of rhyme. This belief is derived from the savage state of fancy. According to Kohl,(1)
"Every sorrowful or joyful emotion that opens the Indian's mouth is at once wrapped up in the
garb of a wabanonagamowin (chanson magicale). If you ask one of them to sing you a simple innocent
hymn in praise of Nature, a spring or jovial hunting stave, he never gives you anything but
a form of incantation, with which he says you will be able to call to you all the birds from
the sky, and all the foxes and wolves from their caves and burrows."(2) The giant's daughter
in the Scotch marchen, Nicht, Nought, Nothing, is thus enabled to call to her aid "all the
birds of the sky". In the same way, if you ask an Indian for a love-song, he will say that
a philtre is really much more efficacious. The savage, in short, is extremely practical. His
arts, music and drawing, exist not pour l'art, but for a definite purpose, as methods of getting
something that the artist wants. The young lover whom Kohl knew, like the lover of Bombyca
in Theocritus, believed in having an image of himself and an image of the beloved. Into the
heart of the female image he thrust magic powders, and he said that this was common, lovers
adding songs, "partly elegiac, partly malicious, and almost criminal forms of incantation".(3)

Among the Indo-Aryans the masaminik or incantations of the Red Man are known as mantras.(1)
These are usually texts from the Veda, and are chanted over the sick and in other circumstances
where magic is believed to be efficacious. Among the New Zealanders the incantations are called
karakias, and are employed in actual life. There is a special karakia to raise the wind. In
Maori myths the hero is very handy with his karakia. Rocks split before him, as before girls
who use incantations in Kaffir and Bushman tales. He assumes the shape of any animal at will,
or flies in the air, all by virtue of the karakia or incantation.(2)

Without multiplying examples in the savage belief that miracles can be wrought by virtue of
physical CORRESPONDANCES, by like acting on like, by the part affecting the whole, and so forth,
we may go on to the magical results produced by the aid of spirits. These may be either spirits
of the dead or spiritual essences that never animated mortal men. Savage magic or science rests
partly on the belief that the world is peopled by a "choir invisible," or rather by a choir
only occasionally visible to certain gifted people, sorcerers and diviners. An enormous amount
of evidence to prove the existence of these tenets has been collected by Mr. Tylor, and is
accessible to all in the chapters on "Animism" in his Primitive Culture. It is not our business
here to account for the universality of the belief in spirits. Mr. Tylor, following Lucretius
and Homer, derives the belief from the reasonings of early men on the phenomena of dreams,
fainting, shadows, visions caused by narcotics, hallucinations, and other facts which suggest
the hypothesis of a separable life apart from the bodily organism. It would scarcely be fair
not to add that the kind of "facts" investigated by the Psychical Society--such "facts" as
the appearance of men at the moment of death in places remote from the scene of their decease,
with such real or delusive experiences as the noises and visions in haunted houses--are familiar
to savages. Without discussing these obscure matters, it may be said that they influence the
thoughts even of some scientifically trained and civilised men. It is natural, therefore, that
they should strongly sway the credulous imagination of backward races, in which they originate
or confirm the belief that life can exist and manifest itself after the death of the body.(1)

(1) See the author's Making of Religion, 1898.

Some examples of savage "ghost-stories," precisely analogous to the "facts" of the Psychical
Society's investigations, may be adduced. The first is curious because it offers among the
Kanekas an example of a belief current in Breton folk-lore. The story is vouched for by Mr.
J. J. Atkinson, late of Noumea, New Caledonia. Mr. Atkinson, we have reason to believe, was
unacquainted with the Breton parallel. To him one day a Kaneka of his acquaintance paid a visit,
and seemed loth to go away. He took leave, returned, and took leave again, till Mr. Atkinson
asked him the reason of his behaviour. He then explained that he was about to die, and would
never see his English friend again. As he seemed in perfect health, Mr. Atkinson rallied him
on his hypochondria; but the poor fellow replied that his fate was sealed. He had lately met
in the wood one whom he took for the Kaneka girl of his heart; but he became aware too late
that she was no mortal woman, but a wood-spirit in the guise of the beloved. The result would
be his death within three days, and, as a matter of fact, he died. This is the groundwork of
the old Breton ballad of Le Sieur Nan, who dies after his intrigue with the forest spectre.(1)
A tale more like a common modern ghost-story is vouched for by Mr. C. J. Du Ve, in Australia.
In the year 1860, a Maneroo black fellow died in the service of Mr. Du Ve. "The day before
he died, having been ill some time, he said that in the night his father, his father's friend,
and a female spirit he could not recognise, had come to him and said that he would die next
day, and that they would wait for him. Mr. Du Ye adds that, though previously the Christian
belief had been explained to this man, it had entirely faded, and that he had gone back to
the belief of his childhood." Mr. Fison, who prints this tale in his Kamilaroi and Kurnai,(2)
adds, "I could give many similar instances which have come within my own knowledge among the
Fijians, and, strange to say, the dying man in all these cases kept his appointment with the
ghosts to the very day".

(1) It may, of course, be conjectured that the French introduced this belief into New Caledonia.

(2) Page 247.

In the Cruise of the Beagle is a parallel anecdote of a Fuegian, Jimmy Button, and his father's
ghost.

Without entering into a discussion of ghosts, it is plain that the kind of evidence, whatever
its value may be, which convinces many educated Europeans of the existence of "veridical" apparitions
has also played its part in the philosophy of uncivilised races. On this belief in apparitions,
then, is based the power of the savage sorcerers and necromants, of the men who converse with
the dead and are aided by disembodied spirits. These men have greatly influenced the beginnings
of mythology. Among certain Australian tribes the necromants are called Birraark.(1) "The Kurnai
tell me," says Mr. Howitt, "that a Birraark was supposed to be initiated by the 'Mrarts (ghosts)
when they met him wandering in the bush.... It was from the ghosts that he obtained replies
to questions concerning events passing at a distance or yet to happen, which might be of interest
or moment to his tribe." Mr. Howitt prints an account of a spiritual seance in the bush.(2)
"The fires were let go down. The Birraark uttered a cry 'coo-ee' at intervals. At length a
distant reply was heard, and shortly afterwards the sound as of persons jumping on the ground
in succession. A voice was then heard in the gloom asking in a strange intonation, 'What is
wanted?' Questions were put by the Birraark and replies given. At the termination of the seance,
the spirit-voice said, 'We are going'. Finally, the Birraark was found in the top of an almost
inaccessible tree, apparently asleep."(3) There was one Birraark at least to every clan. The
Kurnai gave the name of "Brewin" (a powerful evil spirit) to a Birraark who was once carried
away for several days by the Mrarts or spirits.(4) It is a belief with the Australians, as,
according to Bosman, it was with the people of the Gold Coast, that a very powerful wizard
lives far inland, and the Negroes held that to this warlock the spirits of the dead went to
be judged according to the merit of their actions in life. Here we have a doctrine answering
to the Greek belief in "the wizard Minos," Aeacus, and Rhadamanthus, and to the Egyptian idea
of Osiris as judge of the departed.(5) The pretensions of the sorcerer to converse with the
dead are attested by Mr. Brough Smyth.(6) "A sorcerer lying on his stomach spoke to the deceased,
and the other sitting by his side received the precious messages which the dead man told."
As a natural result of these beliefs, the Australian necromant has great power in the tribe.
Mr. Howitt mentions a case in which a group of kindred, ceasing to use their old totemistic
surname, called themselves the children of a famous dead Birraark, who thus became an eponymous
hero, like Ion among the Ionians.(7) Among the Scotch Highlanders the position and practice
of the seer were very like those of the Birraark. "A person," says Scott,(8) "was wrapped up
in the skin of a newly slain bullock and deposited beside a waterfall or at the bottom of a
precipice, or in some other strange, wild and unusual situation, where the scenery around him
suggested nothing but objects of horror. In this situation he revolved in his mind the question
proposed and whatever was impressed on him by his exalted imagination PASSED FOR THE INSPIRATION
OF THE DISEMBODIED SPIRITS who haunt these desolate recesses." A number of examples are given
in Martin's Description of the Western Islands.(9) In the Century magazine (July, 1882) is
a very full report of Thlinkeet medicine-men and metamorphoses.

(3) In the Jesuit Relations (1637), p. 51, we read that the Red Indian sorcerer or Jossakeed
was credited with power to vanish suddenly away out of sight of the men standing around him.
Of him, as of Homeric gods, it might be said, "Who has power to see him come or go against
his will?"

(4) Here, in the first edition, occurred the following passage: "The conception of Brewin is
about as near as the Kurnai get to the idea of a God; their conferring of his name on a powerful
sorcerer is therefore a point of importance and interest". Mr. Howitt's later knowledge demonstrates
an error here.

The sorcerer among the Zulus is, apparently, of a naturally hysterical and nervous constitution.
"He hears the spirits who speak by whistlings speaking to him."(1) Whistling is also the language
of the ghosts in New Caledonia, where Mr. Atkinson informs us that he has occasionally put
an able-bodied Kaneka to ignominious flight by whistling softly in the dusk. The ghosts in
Homer make a similar sound, "and even as bats flit gibbering in the secret place of a wondrous
cavern,... even so the souls gibbered as they fared together" (Odyssey, xxiv. 5). "The familiar
spirits make him" (that Zulu sorcerer) "acquainted with what is about to happen, and then he
divines for the people." As the Birraarks learn songs and dance-music from the Mrarts, so the
Zulu Inyanga or diviners learn magical couplets from the Itongo or spirits.(2)

(1) Callaway, Religious System of the Amazules, p. 265.

(2) On all this, see "Possession" in The Making of Religion.

The evidence of institutions confirms the reports about savage belief in magic. The political
power of the diviners is very great, as may be observed from the fact that a hereditary chief
needs their consecration to make him a chief de jure.(1) In fact, the qualities of the diviner
are those which give his sacred authority to the chief. When he has obtained from the diviners
all their medicines and information as to the mode of using the isitundu (a magical vessel),
it is said that he often orders them to be killed. Now, the chief is so far a medicine-man
that he is lord of the air. "The heaven is the chief's," say the Zulus; and when he calls out
his men, "though the heaven is clear, it becomes clouded by the great wind that arises". Other
Zulus explain this as the mere hyperbole of adulation. "The word of the chief gives confidence
to his troops; they say, 'We are going; the chief has already seen all that will happen in
his vessel'. Such then are chiefs; they use a vessel for divination."(2) The makers of rain
are known in Zululand as "heaven-herds" or "sky-herds," who herd the heaven that it may not
break out and do its will on the property of the people. These men are, in fact, (Greek text
omitted), "cloud-gatherers," like the Homeric Zeus, the lord of the heavens. Their name of
"herds of the heavens" has a Vedic sound. "The herd that herds the lightning," say the Zulus,
"does the same as the herder of the cattle; he does as he does by whistling; he says, 'Tshu-i-i-i.
Depart and go yonder. Do not come here.'" Here let it be observed that the Zulus conceive of
the thunder-clouds and lightning as actual creatures, capable of being herded like sheep. There
is no metaphor or allegory about the matter,(3) and no forgetfulness of the original meaning
of words. The cloud-herd is just like the cowherd, except that not every man, but only sorcerers,
and they who have eaten the "lightning-bird" (a bird shot near the place where lightning has
struck the earth), can herd the clouds of heaven. The same ideas prevail among the Bushmen,
where the rainmaker is asked "to milk a nice gentle female rain"; the rain-clouds are her hair.
Among the Bushmen Rain is a person. Among the Red Indians no metaphor seems to be intended
when it is said that "it is always birds who make the wind, except that of the east". The Dacotahs
once killed a thunder-bird(4) behind Little Crow's village on the Missouri. It had a face like
a man with a nose like an eagle's bill.(5)

The political and social powers which come into the hands of the sorcerers are manifest, even
in the case of the Australians. Tribes and individuals can attempt few enterprises without
the aid of the man who listens to the ghosts. Only he can foretell the future, and, in the
case of the natural death of a member of the tribe, can direct the vengeance of the survivors
against the hostile magician who has committed a murder by "bar" or magic. Among the Zulus
we have seen that sorcery gives the sanction to the power of the chief. "The winds and weather
are at the command" of Bosman's "great fetisher". Inland from the Gold Coast,(1) the king of
Loango, according to the Abbe Proyart, "has credit to make rain fall on earth". Similar beliefs,
with like political results, will be found to follow from the superstition of magic among the
Red Indians of North America. The difficulty of writing about sorcerers among the Red Indians
is caused by the abundance of the evidence. Charlevoix and the other early Jesuit missionaries
found that the jongleurs, as Charlevoix calls the Jossakeeds or medicine-men, were their chief
opponents. As among the Scotch Highlanders, the Australians and the Zulus, the Red Indian jongleur
is visited by the spirits. He covers a hut with the skin of the animal which he commonly wears,
retires thither, and there converses with the bodiless beings.(2) The good missionary like
Mr. Moffat in Africa, was convinced that the exercises of the Jossakeeds were verily supernatural.
"Ces seducteurs ont un veritable commerce avec le pere du mensonge."(3) This was denied by
earlier and wiser Jesuit missionaries. Their political power was naturally great. In time of
war "ils avancent et retardent les marches comme il leur plait". In our own century it was
a medicine-man, Ten Squa Ta Way, who by his magical processes and superstitious rites stirred
up a formidable war against the United States.(4) According to Mr. Pond,(5) the native name
of the Dacotah medicine-men, "Wakan," signifies "men supernaturally gifted". Medicine-men are
believed to be "wakanised" by mystic intercourse with supernatural beings. The business of
the wakanised man is to discern future events, to lead and direct parties on the war-trail,
"to raise the storm or calm the tempest, to converse with the lightning or thunder as with
familiar friends".(6) The wakanised man, like the Australian Birraark and the Zulu diviner,
"dictates chants and prayers". In battle "every Dacotah warrior looks to the Wakan man as almost
his only resource". Belief in Wakan men is, Mr. Pond says, universal among the Dacotahs, except
where Christianity has undermined it. "Their influence is deeply felt by every individual of
the tribe, and controls all their affairs." The Wakan man's functions are absorbed by the general
or war-chief of the tribe, and in Schoolcraft (iv. 495), Captain Eastman prints copies of native
scrolls showing the war-chief at work as a wizard. "The war-chief who leads the party to war
is always one of these medicine-men." In another passage the medicine-men are described as
"having a voice in the sale of land". It must be observed that the Jossakeed, or medicine-man,
pure and simple, exercises a power which is not in itself hereditary. Chieftainship, when associated
with inheritance of property, is hereditary; and when the chief, as among the Zulus, absorbs
supernatural power, then the same man becomes diviner and chief, and is a person of great and
sacred influence. The liveliest account of the performances of the Maori "tohunga" or sorcerer
is to be found in Old New Zealand,(7) by the Pakeha Maori, an English gentleman who had lived
with the natives like one of themselves. The tohunga, says this author,(8) presided over "all
those services and customs which had something approaching to a religious character. They also
pretended to power by means of certain familiar spirits, to foretell future events, and even
in some cases to control them.... The spirit 'entered into' them, and, on being questioned,
gave a response in a sort of half whistling, half-articulate voice, supposed to be the proper
language of spirits." In New South Wales, Mrs. Langlot Parker has witnessed a similar exhibition.
The "spirits" told the truth in this case. The Pakeha Maori was present in a darkened village-hall
when the spirit of a young man, a great friend of his own, was called up by a tohunga. "Suddenly,
without the slightest warning, a voice came out of the darkness.... The voice all through,
it is to be remembered, was not the voice of the tohunga, but a strange melancholy sound, like
the sound of a wind blowing into a hollow vessel. 'It is well with me; my place is a good place.'
The spirit gave an answer to a question which proved to be correct, and then 'Farewell,' cried
the spirit FROM DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND. 'Farewell,' again, FROM HIGH IN AIR. 'Farewell,' once
more came moaning through the distant darkness of the night." As chiefs in New Zealand no less
than tohungas can exercise the mystical and magical power of tabu, that is, of imparting to
any object or person an inviolable character, and can prevent or remit the mysterious punishment
for infringement of tabu, it appears probable that in New Zealand, as well as among the Zulus
and Red Indians, chiefs have a tendency to absorb the sacred character and powers of the tohungas.
This is natural enough, for a tohunga, if he plays his cards well, is sure to acquire property
and hereditary wealth, which, in combination with magical influence, are the necessary qualifications
for the office of the chieftain.

Here is the place to mention a fact which, though at first sight it may appear to have only
a social interest, yet bears on the development of mythology. Property and rank seem to have
been essential to each other in the making of social rank, and where one is absent among contemporary
savages, there we do not find the other. As an example of this, we might take the case of two
peoples who, like the Homeric Ethiopians, are the outermost of men, and dwell far apart at
the ends of the world. The Eskimos and the Fuegians, at the extreme north and south of the
American continent, agree in having little or no private property and no chiefs. Yet magic
is providing a kind of basis of rank. The bleak plains of ice and rock are, like Attica, "the
mother of men without master or lord". Among the "house-mates" of the smaller settlements there
is no head-man, and in the larger gatherings Dr. Rink says that "still less than among the
house-mates was any one belonging to such a place to be considered a chief". The songs and
stories of the Eskimo contain the praises of men who have risen up and killed any usurper who
tried to be a ruler over his "place-mates". No one could possibly establish any authority on
the basis of property, because "superfluous property, implements, etc., rarely existed". If
there are three boats in one household, one of the boats is "borrowed" by the community, and
reverts to the general fund. If we look at the account of the Fuegians described in Admiral
Fitzroy's cruise, we find a similar absence of rank produced by similar causes. In the same
book, however, we get a glimpse of one means by which authority can be exercised. "The doctor-wizard
of each party has much influence over his companions." Among the Eskimos this element in the
growth of authority also exists. A class of wizards called Angakut have power to cause fine
weather, and, by the gift of second-sight and magical practices, can detect crimes, so that
they necessarily become a kind of civil magistrates. These Angekkok or Angakut have familiar
spirits called Torngak, a word connected with the name of their chief spiritual being, Torngarsak.
The Torngak is commonly the ghost of a deceased parent of the sorcerer. "These men," says Egede,
"are held in great honour and esteem among this stupid and ignorant nation, insomuch that nobody
dare ever refuse the strictest obedience when they command him in the name of Torngarsak."
The importance and actual existence of belief in magic has thus been attested by the evidence
of institutions, even among Australians, Fuegians and Eskimos.

It is now necessary to pass from examples of tribes who have superstitious respect for certain
individuals, but who have no property and no chiefs, to peoples who exhibit the phenomenon
of superstitious reverence attached to wealthy rulers or to judges. To take the example of
Ireland, as described in the Senchus Mor, we learn that the chiefs, just like the Angakut of
the Eskimos, had "power to make fair or foul weather" in the literal sense of the words.(1)
In Africa, in the same way, as Bosman, the old traveller, says, "As to what difference there
is between one negro and another, the richest man is the most honoured," yet the most honoured
man has the same magical power as the poor Angakuts of the Eskimos.

(1) Early History of Institutions, p. 195.

"In the Solomon Islands," says Dr. Codrington, "there is nothing to prevent a common man from
becoming a chief, if he can show that he has the mana (supernatural power) for it."(1)

(1) Journ. Anth. Inst., x. iii. 287, 300, 309.

Though it is anticipating a later stage of this inquiry, we must here observe that the sacredness,
and even the magical virtues of barbarous chiefs seem to have descended to the early leaders
of European races. The children of Odin and of Zeus were "sacred kings". The Homeric chiefs,
like those of the Zulus and the Red Men, and of the early Irish and Swedes, exercised an influence
over the physical universe. Homer(1) speaks of "a blameless king, one that fears the gods,
and reigns among many men and mighty, and the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the sheep
bring forth and fail not, and the sea gives store of fish, and all out of his good sovereignty".

(1) Od., xix. 109.

The attributes usually assigned by barbarous peoples to their medicine-men have not yet been
exhausted. We have found that they can foresee and declare the future; that they control the
weather and the sensible world; that they can converse with, visit and employ about their own
business the souls of the dead. It would be easy to show at even greater length that the medicine-man
has everywhere the power of metamorphosis. He can assume the shapes of all beasts, birds, fishes,
insects and inorganic matters, and he can subdue other people to the same enchantment. This
belief obviously rests on the lack of recognised distinction between man and the rest of the
world, which we have so frequently insisted on as a characteristic of savage and barbarous
thought. Examples of accredited metamorphosis are so common everywhere, and so well known,
that it would be waste of space to give a long account of them. In Primitive Culture(1) a cloud
of witnesses to the belief in human tigers, hyaenas, leopards and wolves is collected.(2) Mr.
Lane(3) found metamorphosis by wizards as accredited a working belief at Cairo as it is among
Abipones, Eskimo, or the people of Ashangoland. In various parts of Scotland there is a tale
of a witch who was shot at when in the guise of a hare. In this shape she was wounded, and
the same wound was found on her when she resumed her human appearance. Lafitau, early in the
last century, found precisely the same tale, except that the wizards took the form of birds,
not of hares, among the Red Indians. The birds were wounded by the magical arrows of an old
medicine-man, Shonnoh Koui Eretsi, and these bolts were found in the bodies of the human culprits.
In Japan, as we learn from several stories in Mr. Mitford's Tales of Old Japan, people chiefly
metamorphose themselves into foxes and badgers. The sorcerers of Honduras(4) "possess the power
of transforming men into wild beasts, and were much feared accordingly". Among the Cakchiquels,
a cultivated people of Guatemala, the very name of the clergy, haleb, was derived from their
power of assuming animal shapes, which they took on as easily as the Homeric gods.(5) Regnard,
the French dramatist, who travelled among the Lapps at the end of the seventeenth century (1681),
says: "They believe witches can turn men into cats;" and again, "Under the figures of swans,
crows, falcons and geese, they call up tempests and destroy ships".(6) Among the Bushmen "sorcerers
assume the forms of beasts and jackals".(7) Dobrizhoffer (1717-91), a missionary in Paraguay,
found that "sorcerers arrogate to themselves the power of transforming themselves into tigers".(8)
He was present when the Abipones believed that a conversion of this sort was actually taking
place: "Alas," cried the people, "his whole body is beginning to be covered with tiger-spots;
his nails are growing". Near Loanda, Livingstone found that a "chief may metamorphose himself
into a lion, kill any one he choses, and then resume his proper form".(9) Among the Barotse
and Balonda, "while persons are still alive they may enter into lions and alligators".(10)
Among the Mayas of Central America "sorcerers could transform themselves into dogs, pigs and
other animals; their glance was death to a victim".(11) The Thlinkeets think that their Shamans
can metamorphose themselves into animals at pleasure; and a very old raven was pointed out
to Mr. C. E. S. Wood as an incarnation of the soul of a Shaman.(12) Sir A. C. Lyall finds a
similar belief in flourishing existence in India. The European superstition of the were-wolf
is too well known to need description. Perhaps the most curious legend is that told by Giraldus
Cambrensis about a man and his wife metamorphosed into wolves by an abbot. They retained human
speech, made exemplary professions of Christian faith, and sent for priests when they found
their last hours approaching. In an old Norman ballad a girl is transformed into a white doe,
and hunted and slain by her brother's hounds. The "aboriginal" peoples of India retain similar
convictions. Among the Hos,(13) an old sorcerer called Pusa was known to turn himself habitually
into a tiger, and to eat his neighbour's goats, and even their wives. Examples of the power
of sorcerers to turn, as with the Gorgon's head, their enemies into stone, are peculiarly common
in America.(14) Hearne found that the Indians believed they descended from a dog, who could
turn himself into a handsome young man.(15)

Let us recapitulate the powers attributed all over the world, by the lower people, to medicine-men.
The medicine-man has all miracles at his command. He rules the sky, he flies into the air,
he becomes visible or invisible at will, he can take or confer any form at pleasure, and resume
his human shape. He can control spirits, can converse with the dead, and can descend to their
abodes.

When we begin to examine the gods of MYTHOLOGY, savage or civilised, as distinct from deities
contemplated, in devotion, as moral and creative guardians of ethics, we shall find that, with
the general, though not invariable addition of immortality, they possess the very same accomplishments
as the medicine-man, peay, tohunga, jossakeed, birraark, or whatever name for sorcerer we may
choose. Among the Greeks, Zeus, mythically envisaged, enjoys in heaven all the attributes of
the medicine-man; among the Iroquois, as Pere le Jeune, the old Jesuit missionary, observed,(1)
the medicine-man enjoys on earth all the attributes of Zeus. Briefly, the miraculous and supernatural
endowments of the gods of MYTH, whether these gods be zoomorphic or anthropomorphic, are exactly
the magical properties with which the medicine-man is credited by his tribe. It does not at
all follow, as Euemerus and Mr. Herbert Spencer might argue, that the god was once a real living
medicine-man. But myth-making man confers on the deities of myth the magical powers which he
claims for himself.

(1) Relations (1636), p. 114.

The intellectual condition of savages which has been presented and established by the evidence
both of observers and of institutions, may now be studied in savage myths. These myths, indeed,
would of themselves demonstrate that the ideas which the lower races entertain about the world
correspond with our statement. If any one were to ask himself, from what mental conditions
do the following savage stories arise? he would naturally answer that the minds which conceived
the tales were curious, indolent, credulous of magic and witchcraft, capable of drawing no
line between things and persons, capable of crediting all things with human passions and resolutions.
But, as myths analogous to those of savages, when found among civilised peoples, have been
ascribed to a psychological condition produced by a disease of language acting after civilisation
had made considerable advances, we cannot take the savage myths as proof of what savages think,
believe and practice in the course of daily life. To do so would be, perhaps, to argue in a
circle. We must therefore study the myths of the undeveloped races in themselves.

These myths form a composite whole, so complex and so nebulous that it is hard indeed to array
them in classes and categories. For example, if we look at myths concerning the origin of various
phenomena, we find that some introduce the action of gods or extra-natural beings, while others
rest on a rude theory of capricious evolution; others, again, invoke the aid of the magic of
mortals, and most regard the great natural forces, the heavenly bodies, and the animals, as
so many personal characters capable of voluntarily modifying themselves or of being modified
by the most trivial accidents. Some sort of arrangement, however, must be attempted, only the
student is to understand that the lines are never drawn with definite fixity, that any category
may glide into any other category of myth.

We shall begin by considering some nature myths--myths, that is to say, which explain the facts
of the visible universe. These range from tales about heaven, day, night, the sun and the stars,
to tales accounting for the red breast of the ousel, the habits of the quail, the spots and
stripes of wild beasts, the formation of rocks and stones, the foliage of trees, the shapes
of plants. In a sense these myths are the science of savages; in a sense they are their sacred
history; in a sense they are their fiction and romance. Beginning with the sun, we find, as
Mr. Tylor says, that "in early philosophy throughout the world the sun and moon are alive,
and, as it were, human in their nature".(1) The mass of these solar myths is so enormous that
only a few examples can be given, chosen almost at random out of the heap. The sun is regarded
as a personal being, capable not only of being affected by charms and incantations, but of
being trapped and beaten, of appearing on earth, of taking a wife of the daughters of men.
Garcilasso de la Vega has a story of an Inca prince, a speculative thinker, who was puzzled
by the sun-worship of his ancestors. If the sun be thus all-powerful, the Inca inquired, why
is he plainly subject to laws? why does he go his daily round, instead of wandering at large
up and down the fields of heaven? The prince concluded that there was a will superior to the
sun's will, and he raised a temple to the Unknown Power. Now the phenomena which put the Inca
on the path of monotheistic religion, a path already traditional, according to Garcilasso,
have also struck the fancy of savages. Why, they ask, does the sun run his course like a tamed
beast? A reply suited to a mind which holds that all things are personal is given in myths.
Some one caught and tamed the sun by physical force or by art magic.

(1) Primitive Culture, i. 288.

In Australia the myth says that there was a time when the sun did not set. "It was at all times
day, and the blacks grew weary." Norralie considered and decided that the sun should disappear
at intervals. He addressed the sun in an incantation (couched like the Finnish Kalewala in
the metre of Longfellow's Hiawatha); and the incantation is thus interpreted: "Sun, sun, burn
your wood, burn your internal substance, and go down". The sun therefore now burns out his
fuel in a day, and goes below for fresh firewood.(1)

(1) Brough Smyth, Aborigines of Victoria, i. 430.

In New Zealand the taming of the sun is attributed to the great hero Maui, the Prometheus of
the Maoris. He set snares to catch the sun, but in vain, for the sun's rays bit them through.
According to another account, while Norralie wished to hasten the sun's setting, Maui wanted
to delay it, for the sun used to speed through the heavens at a racing pace. Maui therefore
snared the sun, and beat him so unmercifully that he has been lame ever since, and travels
slowly, giving longer days. "The sun, when beaten, cried out and revealed his second great
name, Taura-mis-te-ra."(1) It will be remembered that Indra, in his abject terror when he fled
after the slaying of Vrittra, also revealed his mystic name. In North America the same story
of the trapping and laming of the sun is told, and attributed to a hero named Tcha-ka-betch.
In Samoa the sun had a child by a Samoan woman. He trapped the sun with a rope made of a vine
and extorted presents. Another Samoan lassoed the sun and made him promise to move more slowly.(2)
These Samoan and Australian fancies are nearly as dignified as the tale in the Aitareya Brahmana.
The gods, afraid "that the sun would fall out of heaven, pulled him up and tied him with five
ropes". These ropes are recognised as verses in the ritual, but probably the ritual is later
than the ropes. In Mexico we find that the sun himself (like the stars in most myths) was once
a human or pre-human devotee, Nanahuatzin, who leapt into a fire to propitiate the gods.(3)
Translated to heaven as the sun, Nanahuatzin burned so very fiercely that he threatened to
reduce the world to a cinder. Arrows were therefore shot at him, and this punishment had as
happy an effect as the beatings administered by Maui and Tcha-ka-betch. Among the Bushmen of
South Africa the sun was once a man, from whose armpit a limited amount of light was radiated
round his hut. Some children threw him up into the sky, and there he stuck, and there he shines.(4)
In the Homeric hymn to Helios, as Mr. Max Muller observes, "the poet looks on Helios as a half
god, almost a hero, who had once lived on earth," which is precisely the view of the Bushmen.(5)
Among the Aztecs the sun is said to have been attacked by a hunter and grievously wounded by
his arrows.(6) The Gallinomeros, in Central California, seem at least to know that the sun
is material and impersonal. They say that when all was dark in the beginning, the animals were
constantly jostling each other. After a painful encounter, the hawk and the coyote collected
two balls of inflammable substance; the hawk (Indra was occasionally a hawk) flew up with them
into heaven, and lighted them with sparks from a flint. There they gave light as sun and moon.
This is an exception to the general rule that the heavenly bodies are regarded as persons.
The Melanesian tale of the bringing of night is a curious contrast to the Mexican, Maori, Australian
and American Indian stories which we have quoted. In Melanesia, as in Australia, the days were
long, indeed endless, and people grew tired; but instead of sending the sun down below by an
incantation when night would follow in course of nature, the Melanesian hero went to Night
(conceived of as a person) and begged his assistance. Night (Qong) received Qat (the hero)
kindly, darkened his eyes, gave him sleep, and, in twelve hours or so, crept up from the horizon
and sent the sun crawling to the west.(7) In the same spirit Paracelsus is said to have attributed
night, not to the absence of the sun, but to the apparition of certain stars which radiate
darkness. It is extraordinary that a myth like the Melanesian should occur in Brazil. There
was endless day till some one married a girl whose father "the great serpent," was the owner
of night. The father sent night bottled up in a gourd. The gourd was not to be uncorked till
the messengers reached the bride, but they, in their curiosity, opened the gourd, and let night
out prematurely.(8)

The myths which have been reported deal mainly with the sun as a person who shines, and at
fixed intervals disappears. His relations with the moon are much more complicated, and are
the subject of endless stories, all explaining in a romantic fashion why the moon waxes and
wanes, whence come her spots, why she is eclipsed, all starting from the premise that sun and
moon are persons with human parts and passions. Sometimes the moon is a man, sometimes a woman
and the sex of the sun varies according to the fancy of the narrators. Different tribes of
the same race, as among the Australians, have different views of the sex of moon and sun. Among
the aborigines of Victoria, the moon, like the sun among the Bushmen, was a black fellow before
he went up into the sky. After an unusually savage career, he was killed with a stone hatchet
by the wives of the eagle, and now he shines in the heavens.(1) Another myth explanatory of
the moon's phases was found by Mr. Meyer in 1846 among the natives of Encounter Bay. According
to them the moon is a woman, and a bad woman to boot. She lives a life of dissipation among
men, which makes her consumptive, and she wastes away till they drive her from their company.
While she is in retreat, she lives on nourishing roots, becomes quite plump, resumes her gay
career, and again wastes away. The same tribe, strangely enough, think that the sun also is
a woman. Every night she descends among the dead, who stand in double lines to greet her and
let her pass. She has a lover among the dead, who has presented her with a red kangaroo skin,
and in this she appears at her rising. Such is the view of rosy-fingered Dawn entertained by
the blacks of Encounter Bay. In South America, among the Muyscas of Bogota, the moon, Huythaca,
is the malevolent wife of the child of the sun; she was a woman before her husband banished
her to the fields of space.(2) The moon is a man among the Khasias of the Himalaya, and he
was guilty of the unpardonable offence of admiring his mother-in-law. As a general rule, the
mother-in-law is not even to be spoken to by the savage son-in-law. The lady threw ashes in
his face to discourage his passion, hence the moon's spots. The waning of the moon suggested
the most beautiful and best known of savage myths, that in which the moon sends a beast to
tell mortals that, though they die like her, like her they shall be born again.(3) Because
the spots in the moon were thought to resemble a hare they were accounted for in Mexico by
the hypothesis that a god smote the moon in the face with a rabbit;(4) in Zululand and Thibet
by a fancied translation of a good or bad hare to the moon.

The Eskimos have a peculiar myth to account for the moon's spots. Sun and moon were human brother
and sister. In the darkness the moon once attempted the virtue of the sun. She smeared his
face over with ashes, that she might detect him when a light was brought. She did discover
who her assailant had been, fled to the sky, and became the sun. The moon still pursues her,
and his face is still blackened with the marks of ashes.(1) Gervaise(2) says that in Macassar
the moon was held to be with child by the sun, and that when he pursued her and wished to beat
her, she was delivered of the earth. They are now reconciled. About the alternate appearance
of sun and moon a beautifully complete and adequate tale is told by the Piute Indians of California.
No more adequate and scientific explanation could possibly be offered, granting the hypothesis
that sun and moon are human persons and savage persons. The myth is printed as it was taken
down by Mr. De Quille from the lips of Tooroop Eenah (Desert Father), a chief of the Piutes,
and published in a San Francisco newspaper.

"Down deep under the ground--deep, deep, under all the ground--is a great hole. At night, when
he has passed over the world, looked down on everything and finished his work, he, the sun,
goes into his hole, and he crawls and creeps along it till he comes to his bed in the middle
part of the earth. So then he, the sun, sleeps there in his bed all night.

"This hole is so little, and he, the sun, is so big, that he cannot turn round in it; and so
he must, when he has had all his sleep, pass on through, and in the morning we see him come
out in the east. When he, the sun, has so come out, he begins to hunt up through the sky to
catch and eat any that he can of the stars, his children, for if he does not so catch and eat
he cannot live. He, the sun, is not all seen. The shape of him is like a snake or a lizard.
It is not his head that we can see, but his belly, filled up with the stars that times and
times he has swallowed.

"The moon is the mother of the heavens and is the wife of the sun. She, the moon, goes into
the same hole as her husband to sleep her naps. But always she has great fear of the sun, her
husband, and when he comes through the hole to the nobee (tent) deep in the ground to sleep,
she gets out and comes away if he be cross.

"She, the moon, has great love for her children, the stars, and is happy to travel among them
in the above; and they, her children, feel safe, and sing and dance as she passes along. But
the mother, she cannot help that some of her children must be swallowed by the father every
month. It is ordered that way by the Pah-ah (Great Spirit), who lives above the place of all.

"Every month that father, the sun, does swallow some of the stars, his children, and then that
mother, the moon, feels sorrow. She must mourn; so she must put the black on her face for to
mourn the dead. You see the Piute women put black on their faces when a child is gone. But
the dark will wear away from the face of that mother, the moon, a little and a little every
day, and after a time again we see all bright the face of her. But soon more of her children
are gone, and again she must put on her face the pitch and the black."

Here all the phenomena are accounted for, and the explanation is as advanced as the Egyptian
doctrine of the hole under the earth where the sun goes when he passes from our view. And still
the Great Spirit is over all: Religion comes athwart Myth.

Mr. Tylor quotes(1) a nature myth about sun, moon and stars which remarkably corresponds to
the speculation of the Piutes. The Mintira of the Malayan Peninsula say that both sun and moon
are women. The stars are the moon's children; once the sun had as many. They each agreed (like
the women of Jerusalem in the famine), to eat their own children; but the sun swallowed her
whole family, while the moon concealed hers. When the sun saw this she was exceedingly angry,
and pursued the moon to kill her. Occasionally she gets a bite out of the moon, and that is
an eclipse. The Hos of North-East India tell the same tale, but say that the sun cleft the
moon in twain for her treachery, and that she continues to be cut in two and grow again every
month. With these sun and moon legends sometimes coexists the RELIGIOUS belief in a Creator
of these and of all things.

(1) Primitive Culture, i. 356.

In harmony with the general hypothesis that all objects in nature are personal, and human or
bestial, in real shape, and in passion and habits, are the myths which account for eclipses.
These have so frequently been published and commented on(1) that a long statement would be
tedious and superfluous. To the savage mind, and even to the Chinese and the peasants of some
European countries, the need of an explanation is satisfied by the myth that an evil beast
is devouring the sun or the moon. The people even try by firing off guns, shrieking, and clashing
cymbals, to frighten the beast (wolf, pig, dragon, or what not) from his prey. What the hungry
monster in the sky is doing when he is not biting the sun or moon we are not informed. Probably
he herds with the big bird whose wings, among the Dacotahs of America and the Zulus of Africa,
make thunder; or he may associate with the dragons, serpents, cows and other aerial cattle
which supply the rain, and show themselves in the waterspout. Chinese, Greenland, Hindoo, Finnish,
Lithunian and Moorish examples of the myth about the moon-devouring beasts are vouched for
by Grimm.(2) A Mongolian legend has it that the gods wished to punish the maleficent Arakho
for his misdeeds, but Arakho hid so cleverly that their limited omnipotence could not find
him. The sun, when asked to turn spy, gave an evasive answer. The moon told the truth. Arakho
was punished, and ever since he chases sun and moon. When he nearly catches either of them,
there is an eclipse, and the people try to drive him off by making a hideous uproar with musical
and other instruments.(3) Captain Beeckman in 1704 was in Borneo, when the natives declared
that the devil "was eating the moon".

Dr. Brinton in his Myths and Myth-Makers gives examples from Peruvians, Tupis, Creeks, Iroquois
and Algonkins. It would be easy, and is perhaps superfluous, to go on multiplying proofs of
the belief that sun and moon are, or have been, persons. In the Hervey Isles these two luminaries
are thought to have been made out of the body of a child cut in twain by his parents. The blood
escaped from the half which is the moon, hence her pallor.(1) This tale is an exception to
the general rule, but reminds us of the many myths which represent the things in the world
as having been made out of a mutilated man, like the Vedic Purusha. It is hardly necessary,
except by way of record, to point out that the Greek myths of sun and moon, like the myths
of savages, start from the conception of the solar and lunar bodies as persons with parts and
passions, human loves and human sorrows. As in the Mongolian myth of Arakho, the sun "sees
all and hears all," and, less honourable than the Mongolian sun, he plays the spy for Hephaestus
on the loves of Ares and Aphrodite. He has mistresses and human children, such as Circe and
Aeetes.(2)

The sun is all-seeing and all-penetrating. In a Greek song of to-day a mother sends a message
to an absent daughter by the sun; it is but an unconscious repetition of the request of the
dying Ajax that the heavenly body will tell his fate to his old father and his sorrowing spouse.(1)

(1) Sophocles, Ajax, 846.

Selene, the moon, like Helios, the sun, was a person, and amorous. Beloved by Zeus, she gave
birth to Pandia, and Pan gained her affection by the simple rustic gift of a fleece.(1) The
Australian Dawn, with her present of a red kangaroo skin, was not more lightly won than the
chaste Selene. Her affection for Endymion is well known, and her cold white glance shines through
the crevices of his mountain grave, hewn in a rocky wall, like the tombs of Phrygia.(2) She
is the sister of the sun in Hesiod, the daughter (by his sister) of Hyperion in the Homeric
hymns to Helios.

In Greece the aspects of sun and moon take the most ideal human forms, and show themselves
in the most gracious myths. But, after all, these retain in their anthropomorphism the marks
of the earliest fancy, the fancy of Eskimos and Australians. It seems to be commonly thought
that the existence of solar myths is denied by anthropologists. This is a vulgar error. There
is an enormous mass of solar myths, but they are not caused by "a disease of language," and--all
myths are not solar!

There is no occasion to dwell long on myths of the same character in which the stars are accounted
for as transformed human adventurers. It has often been shown that this opinion is practically
of world-wide distribution.(1) We find it in Australia, Persia, Greece, among the Bushmen,
in North and South America, among the Eskimos, in ancient Egypt, in New Zealand, in ancient
India--briefly, wherever we look. The Sanskrit forms of these myths have been said to arise
from confusion as to the meaning of words. But is it credible that, in all languages, however
different, the same kind of unconscious puns should have led to the same mistaken beliefs?
As the savage, barbarous and Greek star-myths (such as that of Callisto, first changed into
a bear and then into a constellation) are familiar to most readers, a few examples of Sanskrit
star-stories are offered here from the Satapatha Brahmana.(2) Fires are not, according to the
Brahmana ritual, to be lighted under the stars called Krittikas, the Pleiades. The reason is
that the stars were the wives of the bears (Riksha), for the group known in Brahmanic times
as the Rishis (sages) were originally called the Rikshas (bears). But the wives of the bears
were excluded from the society of their husbands, for the bears rise in the north and their
wives in the east. Therefore the worshipper should not set up his fires under the Pleiades,
lest he should thereby be separated from the company of his wife. The Brahmanas(3) also tell
us that Prajapati had an unholy passion for his daughter, who was in the form of a doe. The
gods made Rudra fire an arrow at Prajapati to punish him; he was wounded, and leaped into the
sky, where he became one constellation and his daughter another, and the arrow a third group
of stars. In general, according to the Brahmanas, "the stars are the lights of virtuous men
who go to the heavenly world".(4)

are late fictions consciously moulded on traditional data.

Passing from savage myths explanatory of the nature of celestial bodies to myths accounting
for the formation and colour and habits of beasts, birds and fishes, we find ourselves, as
an old Jesuit missionary says, in the midst of a barbarous version of Ovid's Metamorphoses.
It has been shown that the possibility of interchange of form between man and beast is part
of the working belief of everyday existence among the lower peoples. They regard all things
as on one level, or, to use an old political phrase, they "level up" everything to equality
with the human status. Thus Mr. Im Thurn, a very good observer, found that to the Indians of
Guiana "all objects, animate or inaminate, seem exactly of the same nature, except that they
differ by the accident of bodily form". Clearly to grasp this entirely natural conception of
primitive man, the civilised student must make a great effort to forget for a time all that
science has taught him of the differences between the objects which fill the world.(1) "To
the ear of the savage, animals certainly seem to talk." "As far as the Indians of Guiana are
concerned, I do not believe that they distinguish such beings as sun and moon, or such other
natural phenomena as winds and storms, from men and other animals, from plants and other inanimate
objects, or from any other objects whatsoever." Bancroft says about North American myths, "Beasts
and birds and fishes fetch and carry, talk and act, in a way that leaves even Aesop's heroes
quite in the shade".(2)

to metamorphosis will be found in J. G. Muller's Amerikanischen Urreligionen, p. 62 et seq.;

The savage tendency is to see in inanimate things animals, and in animals disguised men. M.
Reville quotes in his Religions des Peuples Non-Civilise's, i. 64, the story of some Negroes,
who, the first time they were shown a cornemuse, took the instrument for a beast, the two holes
for its eyes. The Highlander who looted a watch at Prestonpans, and observing, "She's teed,"
sold it cheap when it ran down, was in the same psychological condition. A queer bit of savage
science is displayed on a black stone tobacco-pipe from the Pacific Coast.(1) The savage artist
has carved the pipe in the likeness of a steamer, as a steamer is conceived by him. "Unable
to account for the motive power, he imagines the paddle to be linked round the tongue of a
coiled serpent, fastened to the tail of the vessel," and so he represents it on the black stone
pipe. Nay, a savage's belief that beasts are on his own level is so literal, that he actually
makes blood-covenants with the lower animals, as he does with men, mingling his gore with theirs,
or smearing both together on a stone;(2) while to bury dead animals with sacred rites is as
usual among the Bedouins and Malagasies to-day as in ancient Egypt or Attica. In the same way
the Ainos of Japan, who regard the bear as a kinsman, sacrifice a bear once a year. But, to
propitiate the animal and his connections, they appoint him a "mother," an Aino girl, who looks
after his comforts, and behaves in a way as maternal as possible. The bear is now a kinsman,
(Greek text omitted), and cannot avenge himself within the kin. This, at least, seems to be
the humour of it. In Lagarde's Reliquiae Juris Ecclesiastici Antiquissimae a similar Syrian
covenant of kinship with insects is described. About 700 A. D., when a Syrian garden was infested
by caterpillars, the maidens were assembled, and one caterpillar was caught. Then one of the
virgins was "made its mother," and the creature was buried with due lamentations. The "mother"
was then brought to the spot where the pests were, her companions bewailed her, and the caterpillars
perished like their chosen kinsman, but without extorting revenge.(3) Revenge was out of their
reach. They had been brought within the kin of their foes, and there were no Erinnyes, "avengers
of kindred blood," to help them. People in this condition of belief naturally tell hundreds
of tales, in which men, stones, trees, beasts, shift shapes, and in which the modifications
of animal forms are caused by accident, or by human agency, or by magic, or by metamorphosis.
Such tales survive in our modern folk-lore. To make our meaning clear, we may give the European
nursery-myth of the origin of the donkey's long ears, and, among other illustrations, the Australian
myth of the origin of the black and white plumage of the pelican. Mr. Ralston has published
the Russian version of the myth of the donkey's ears. The Spanish form, which is identical
with the Russian, is given by Fernan Caballero in La Gaviota.

(3) We are indebted to Professor Robertson Smith for this example, and to Miss Bird's Journal,
pp. 90, 97, for the Aino parallel.

"Listen! do you know why your ears are so big?" (the story is told to a stupid little boy with
big ears). "When Father Adam found himself in Paradise with the animals, he gave each its name;
those of THY species, my child, he named 'donkeys'. One day, not long after, he called the
beasts together, and asked each to tell him its name. They all answered right except the animals
of THY sort, and they had forgotten their name! Then Father Adam was very angry, and, taking
that forgetful donkey by the ears, he pulled them out, screaming 'You are called DONKEY!' And
the donkey's ears have been long ever since." This, to a child, is a credible explanation.
So, perhaps, is another survival of this form of science--the Scotch explanation of the black
marks on the haddock; they were impressed by St. Peter's finger and thumb when he took the
piece of money for Caesar's tax out of the fish's mouth.

Turning from folk-lore to savage beliefs, we learn that from one end of Africa to another the
honey-bird, schneter, is said to be an old woman whose son was lost, and who pursued him till
she was turned into a bird, which still shrieks his name, "Schneter, Schneter".(1) In the same
way the manners of most of the birds known to the Greeks were accounted for by the myth that
they had been men and women. Zeus, for example, turned Ceyx and Halcyon into sea-fowls because
they were too proud in their married happiness.(2) To these myths of the origin of various
animals we shall return, but we must not forget the black and white Australian pelican. Why
is the pelican parti-coloured?(3) For this reason: After the Flood (the origin of which is
variously explained by the Murri), the pelican (who had been a black fellow) made a canoe,
and went about like a kind of Noah, trying to save the drowning. In the course of his benevolent
mission he fell in love with a woman, but she and her friends played him a trick and escaped
from him. The pelican at once prepared to go on the war-path. The first thing to do was to
daub himself white, as is the custom of the blacks before a battle. They think the white pipe-clay
strikes terror and inspires respect among the enemy. But when the pelican was only half pipe-clayed,
another pelican came past, and, "not knowing what such a queer black and white thing was, struck
the first pelican with his beak and killed him. Before that pelicans were all black; now they
are black and white. That is the reason."(4)

(1) Barth, iii. 358.

(2) Apollodorus, i. 7 (13, 12).

(3) Sahagun, viii. 2, accounts for colours of eagle and tiger. A number of races explain the
habits and marks of animals as the result of a curse or blessing of a god or hero. The Hottentots,
the Huarochiri of Peru, the New Zealanders (Shortland, Traditions, p. 57), are among the peoples
which use this myth.

(4) Brough Symth, Aborigines of Australia, i. 477, 478.

"That is the reason." Therewith native philosopy is satisfied, and does not examine in Mr.
Darwin's laborious manner the slow evolution of the colour of the pelican's plumage. The mythological
stories about animals are rather difficult to treat, because they are so much mixed up with
the topic of totemism. Here we only examine myths which account by means of a legend for certain
peculiarities in the habits, cries, or colours and shapes of animals. The Ojibbeways told Kohl
they had a story for every creature, accounting for its ways and appearance. Among the Greeks,
as among Australians and Bushmen, we find that nearly every notable bird or beast had its tradition.
The nightingale and the swallow have a story of the most savage description, a story reported
by Apollodorus, though Homer(1) refers to another, and, as usual, to a gentler and more refined
form of the myth. Here is the version of Apollodorus. "Pandion" (an early king of Athens) "married
Zeuxippe, his mother's sister, by whom he had two daughters, Procne and Philomela, and two
sons, Erechtheus and Butes. A war broke out with Labdas about some debatable land, and Erechtheus
invited the alliance of Tereus of Thrace, the son of Ares. Having brought the war, with the
aid of Tereus, to a happy end, he gave him his daughter Procne to wife. By Procne, Tereus had
a son, Itys, and thereafter fell in love with Philomela, whom he seduced, pretending that Procne
was dead, whereas he had really concealed her somewhere in his lands. Thereon he married Philomela,
and cut out her tongue. But she wove into a robe characters that told the whole story, and
by means of these acquainted Procne with her sufferings. Thereon Procne found her sister, and
slew Itys, her own son, whose body she cooked, and served up to Tereus in a banquet. Thereafter
Procne and her sister fled together, and Tereus seized an axe and followed after them. They
were overtaken at Daulia in Phocis, and prayed to the gods that they might be turned into birds.
So Procne became the nightingale, and Philomela the swallow, while Tereus was changed into
a hoopoe."(2) Pausanias has a different legend; Procne and Philomela died of excessive grief.

(1) Odyssey, xix. 523.

(2) A Red Indian nightingale-myth is alluded to by J. G. Muller, Amerik. Urrel., p. 175. Some
one was turned into a nightingale by the sun, and still wails for a lost lover.

These ancient men and women metamorphosed into birds were HONOURED AS ANCESTORS by the Athenians.(1)
Thus the unceasing musical wail of the nightingale and the shrill cry of the swallow were explained
by a Greek story. The birds were lamenting their old human sorrow, as the honey-bird in Africa
still repeats the name of her lost son.

(1) Pausanias, i. v. Pausanias thinks such things no longer occur.

Why does the red-robin live near the dwellings of men, a bold and friendly bird? The Chippeway
Indians say he was once a young brave whose father set him a task too cruel for his strength,
and made him starve too long when he reached man's estate. He turned into a robin, and said
to his father, "I shall always be the friend of man, and keep near their dwellings. I could
not gratify your pride as a warrior, but I will cheer you by my songs."(1) The converse of
this legend is the Greek myth of the hawk. Why is the hawk so hated by birds? Hierax was a
benevolent person who succoured a race hated by Poseidon. The god therefore changed him into
a hawk, and made him as much detested by birds, and as fatal to them, as he had been beloved
by and gentle to men.(2) The Hervey Islanders explain the peculiarities of several fishes by
the share they took in the adventures of Ina, who stamped, for example, on the sole, and so
flattened him for ever.(3) In Greece the dolphins were, according to the Homeric hymn to Dionysus,
metamorphosed pirates who had insulted the god. But because the dolphin found the hidden sea-goddess
whom Poseidon loved, the dolphin, too, was raised by the grateful sea-god to the stars.(4)
The vulture and the heron, according to Boeo (said to have been a priestess in Delphi and the
author of a Greek treatise on the traditions about birds), were once a man named Aigupios (vulture)
and his mother, Boulis. They sinned inadvertently, like Oedipus and Jocasta; wherefore Boulis,
becoming aware of the guilt, was about to put out the eyes of her son and slay herself. Then
they were changed, Boulis into the heron, "which tears out and feeds on the eyes of snakes,
birds and fishes, and Aigupios into the vulture which bears his name". This story, of which
the more repulsive details are suppressed, is much less pleasing and more savage than the Hervey
Islanders' myth of the origin of pigs. Maaru was an old blind man who lived with his son Kationgia.
There came a year of famine, and Kationgia had great difficulty in finding food for himself
and his father. He gave the blind old man puddings of banana roots and fishes, while he lived
himself on sea-slugs and shellfish, like the people of Terra del Fuego. But blind old Maaru
suspected his son of giving him the worst share and keeping what was best for himself. At last
he discovered that Kationgia was really being starved; he felt his body, and found that he
was a mere living skeleton. The two wept together, and the father made a feast of some cocoa-nuts
and bread-fruit, which he had reserved against the last extremity. When all was finished, he
said he had eaten his last meal and was about to die. He ordered his son to cover him with
leaves and grass, and return to the spot in four days. If worms were crawling about, he was
to throw leaves and grass over them and come back four days later. Kationgia did as he was
instructed, and, on his second visit to the grave, found the whole mass of leaves in commotion.
A brood of pigs, black, white and speckled, had sprung up from the soil; famine was a thing
of the past, and Kationgia became a great chief in the island.(5)

"The owl was a baker's daughter" is the fragment of Christian mythology preserved by Ophelia.
The baker's daughter behaved rudely to our Lord, and was changed into the bird that looks not
on the sun. The Greeks had a similar legend of feminine impiety by which they mythically explained
the origin of the owl, the bat and the eagle-owl. Minyas of Orchomenos had three daughters,
Leucippe, Arsippe and Alcathoe, most industrious women, who declined to join the wild mysteries
of Dionysus. The god took the shape of a maiden, and tried to win them to his worship. They
refused, and he assumed the form of a bull, a lion, and a leopard as easily as the chiefs of
the Abipones become tigers, or as the chiefs among the African Barotse and Balonda metamorphose
themselves into lions and alligators.(1) The daughters of Minyas, in alarm, drew lots to determine
which of them should sacrifice a victim to the god. Leucippe drew the lot and offered up her
own son. They then rushed to join the sacred rites of Dionysus, when Hermes transformed them
into the bat, the owl and the eagle-owl, and these three hide from the light of the sun.(2)

A few examples of Bushman and Australian myths explanatory of the colours and habits of animals
will probably suffice to establish the resemblance between savage and Hellenic legends of this
character. The Bushman myth about the origin of the eland (a large antelope) is not printed
in full by Dr. Bleek, but he observes that it "gives an account of the reasons for the colours
of the gemsbok, hartebeest, eland, quagga and springbok".(1) Speculative Bushmen seem to have
been puzzled to account for the wildness of the eland. It would be much more convenient if
the eland were tame and could be easily captured. They explain its wildness by saying that
the eland was "spoiled" before Cagn, the creator, or rather maker of most things, had quite
finished it. Cagn's relations came and hunted the first eland too soon, after which all other
elands grew wild. Cagn then said, "Go and hunt them and try to kill one; that is now your work,
for it was you who spoilt them".(2) The Bushmen have another myth explanatory of the white
patches on the breasts of crows in their country. Some men tarried long at their hunting, and
their wives sent out crows in search of their husbands. Round each crow's neck was hung a piece
of fat to serve as food on the journey. Hence the crows have white patches on breast and neck.

In Australia the origins of nearly all animals appear to be explained in myths, of which a
fair collection is printed in Mr. Brough Symth's Aborigines of Victoria.(1) Still better examples
occur in Mrs. Langloh Parker's Australian Legends. Why is the crane so thin? Once he was a
man named Kar-ween, the second man fashioned out of clay by Pund-jel, a singular creative being,
whose chequered career is traced elsewhere in our chapter on "Savage Myths of the Origin of
the World and of Man". Kar-ween and Pund-jel had a quarrel about the wives of the former, whom
Pund-jel was inclined to admire. The crafty Kar-ween gave a dance (jugargiull, corobboree),
at which the creator Pund-jel was disporting himself gaily (like the Great Panjandrum), when
Kar-ween pinned him with a spear. Pund-jel threw another which took Kar-ween in the knee-joint,
so that he could not walk, but soon pined away and became a mere skeleton. "Thereupon Pund-jel
made Kar-ween a crane," and that is why the crane has such attenuated legs. The Kortume, Munkari
and Waingilhe, now birds, were once men. The two latter behaved unkindly to their friend Kortume,
who shot them out of his hut in a storm of rain, singing at the same time an incantation. The
three then turned into birds, and when the Kortume sings it is a token that rain may be expected.

Let us now compare with these Australian myths of the origin of certain species of birds the
Greek story of the origin of frogs, as told by Menecrates and Nicander.(1) The frogs were herdsmen
metamorphosed by Leto, the mother of Apollo. But, by way of showing how closely akin are the
fancies of Greeks and Australian black fellows, we shall tell the legend without the proper
names, which gave it a fictitious dignity.

(1) Antoninus Liberalis, xxxv.

THE ORIGIN OF FROGS.

"A woman bore two children, and sought for a water-spring wherein to bathe them. She found
a well, but herdsmen drove her away from it that their cattle might drink. Then some wolves
met her and led her to a river, of which she drank, and in its waters she bathed her children.
Then she went back to the well where the herdsmen were now bathing, and she turned them all
into frogs. She struck their backs and shoulders with a rough stone and drove them into the
waters, and ever since that day frogs live in marshes and beside rivers."

A volume might be filled with such examples of the kindred fancies of Greeks and savages. Enough
has probably been said to illustrate our point, which is that Greek myths of this character
were inherited from the period of savagery, when ideas of metamorphosis and of the kinship
of men and beasts were real practical beliefs. Events conceived to be common in real life were
introduced into myths, and these myths were savage science, and were intended to account for
the Origin of Species. But when once this train of imagination has been fired, it burns on
both in literature and in the legends of the peasantry. Every one who writes a Christmas tale
for children now employs the machinery of metamorphosis, and in European folk-lore, as Fontenelle
remarked, stories persist which are precisely similar in kind to the minor myths of savages.

Reasoning in this wise, the Mundas of Bengal thus account for peculiarities of certain animals.
Sing Bonga, the chief god, cast certain people out of heaven; they fell to earth, found iron
ore, and began smelting it. The black smoke displeased Sing Bonga, who sent two king crows
and an owl to bid people cease to pollute the atmosphere. But the iron smelters spoiled these
birds' tails, and blackened the previously white crow, scorched its beak red, and flattened
its head. Sing Bonga burned man, and turned woman into hills and waterspouts.(1)

Examples of this class of myth in Indo-Aryan literature are not hard to find. Why is dawn red?
Why are donkeys slow? Why have mules no young ones? Mules have no foals because they were severely
burned when Agni (fire) drove them in a chariot race. Dawn is red, not because (as in Australia)
she wears a red kangaroo cloak, but because she competed in this race with red cows for her
coursers. Donkeys are slow because they never recovered from their exertions in the same race,
when the Asvins called on their asses and landed themselves the winners.(1) And cows are accommodated
with horns for a reason no less probable and satisfactory.(2)

Though in the legends of the less developed peoples men and women are more frequently metamorphosed
into birds and beasts than into stones and plants, yet such changes of form are by no means
unknown. To the north-east of Western Point there lies a range of hills, inhabited, according
to the natives of Victoria, by a creature whose body is made of stone, and weapons make no
wound in so sturdy a constitution. The blacks refuse to visit the range haunted by the mythic
stone beast. "Some black fellows were once camped at the lakes near Shaving Point. They were
cooking their fish when a native dog came up. They did not give him anything to eat. He became
cross and said, 'You black fellows have lots of fish, but you give me none'. So he changed
them all into a big rock. This is quite true, for the big rock is there to this day, and I
have seen it with my own eyes."(1) Another native, Toolabar, says that the women of the fishing
party cried out yacka torn, "very good". A dog replied yacka torn, and they were all changed
into rocks. This very man, Toolabar, once heard a dog begin to talk, whereupon he and his father
fled. Had they waited they would have become stones. "We should have been like it, wallung,"
that is, stones.

(1) Native narrator, ap. Brough Smyth, i. 479.

Among the North American Indians any stone which has a resemblance to the human or animal figure
is explained as an example of metamorphosis. Three stones among the Aricaras were a girl, her
lover and her dog, who fled from home because the course of true love did not run smooth, and
who were petrified. Certain stones near Chinook Point were sea-giants who swallowed a man.
His brother, by aid of fire, dried up the bay and released the man, still alive, from the body
of the giant. Then the giants were turned into rocks.(1) The rising sun in Popol Vuh (if the
evidence of Popol Vuh, the Quichua sacred book, is to be accepted) changed into stone the lion,
serpent and tiger gods. The Standing Rock on the Upper Missouri is adored by the Indians, and
decorated with coloured ribbons and skins of animals. This stone was a woman, who, like Niobe,
became literally petrified with grief when her husband took a second wife. Another stone-woman
in a cave on the banks of the Kickapoo was wont to kill people who came near her, and is even
now approached with great respect. The Oneidas and Dacotahs claim descent from stones to which
they ascribe animation.(2) Montesinos speaks of a sacred stone which was removed from a mountain
by one of the Incas. A parrot flew out of it and lodged in another stone, which the natives
still worship.(3) The Breton myth about one of the great stone circles (the stones were peasants
who danced on a Sunday) is a well-known example of this kind of myth surviving in folk-lore.
There is a kind of stone Actaeon(4) near Little Muniton Creek, "resembling the bust of a man
whose head is decorated with the horns of a stag".(5) A crowd of myths of metamorphosis into
stone will be found among the Iroquois legends in Report of Bureau of Ethnology, 1880-81. If
men may become stones, on the other hand, in Samoa (as in the Greek myth of Deucalion), stones
may become men.(6) Gods, too, especially when these gods happen to be cuttlefish, might be
petrified. They were chased in Samoa by an Upolu hero, who caught them in a great net and killed
them. "They were changed into stones, and now stand up in a rocky part of the lagoon on the
north side of Upolu."(7) Mauke, the first man, came out of a stone. In short,(8) men and stones
and beasts and gods and thunder have interchangeable forms. In Mangaia(9) the god Ra was tossed
up into the sky by Maui and became pumice-stone. Many samples of this petrified deity are found
in Mangaia. In Melanesia matters are so mixed that it is not easy to decide whether a worshipful
stone is the dwelling of a dead man's soul or is of spiritual merit in itself, or whether "the
stone is the spirit's outward part or organ". The Vui, or spirit, has much the same relations
with snakes, owls and sharks.(10) Qasavara, the mythical opponent of Qat, the Melanesian Prometheus,
"fell dead from heaven" (like Ra in Mangia), and was turned into a stone, on which sacrifices
are made by those who desire strength in fighting.

Without delaying longer among savage myths of metamorphosis into stones, it may be briefly
shown that the Greeks retained this with all the other vagaries of early fancy. Every one remembers
the use which Perseus made of the Gorgon's head, and the stones on the coast of Seriphus, which,
like the stones near Western Point in Victoria, had once been men, the enemies of the hero.
"Also he slew the Gorgon," sings Pindar, "and bare home her head, with serpent tresses decked,
to the island folk a stony death." Observe Pindar's explanatory remark: "I ween there is no
marvel impossible if gods have wrought thereto". In the same pious spirit a Turk in an isle
of the Levant once told Mr. Newton a story of how a man hunted a stag, and the stag spoke to
him. "The stag spoke?" said Mr. Newton. "Yes, by Allah's will," replied the Turk. Like Pindar,
he was repeating an incident quite natural to the minds of Australians, or Bushmen, or Samoans,
or Red Men, but, like the religious Pindar, he felt that the affair was rather marvellous,
and accounted for it by the exercise of omnipotent power.(1) The Greek example of Niobe and
her children may best be quoted in Mr. Bridges' translation from the Iliad:--

     And somewhere now, among lone mountain rocks
     On Sipylus, where couch the nymphs at night
     Who dance all day by Achelous' stream,
     The once proud mother lies, herself a rook,
     And in cold breast broods o'er the goddess' wrong.
                         --Prometheus the fire-bringer.(2)

In the Iliad it is added that Cronion made the people into stones. The attitude of the later
Greek mind towards these myths may be observed in a fragment of Philemon, the comic poet. "Never,
by the gods, have I believed, nor will believe, that Niobe the stone was once a woman. Nay,
by reason of her calamities she became speechless, and so, from her silence, was called a stone."(3)

(1) Pindar, Pyth. x., Myers's translation.

(2) xxiv. 611.

(3) The Scholiast on Iliad, xxiv. 6, 7.

There is another famous petrification in the Iliad. When the prodigy of the snake and the sparrows
had appeared to the assembled Achaeans at Aulis, Zeus displayed a great marvel, and changed
into a stone the serpent which swallowed the young of the sparrow. Changes into stone, though
less common than changes into fishes, birds and beasts, were thus obviously not too strange
for the credulity of Greek mythology, which could also believe that a stone became the mother
of Agdestis by Zeus.

As to interchange of shape between men and women and PLANTS, our information, so far as the
lower races are concerned, is less copious. It has already been shown that the totems of many
stocks in all parts of the world are plants, and this belief in connection with a plant by
itself demonstrates that the confused belief in all things being on one level has thus introduced
vegetables into the dominion of myth. As far as possessing souls is concerned, Mr. Tylor has
proved that plants are as well equipped as men or beasts or minerals.(1) In India the doctrine
of transmigration widely and clearly recognises the idea of trees or smaller plants being animated
by human souls. In the well-known ancient Egyptian story of "The Two Brothers,"(2) the life
of the younger is practically merged in that of the acacia tree where he has hidden his heart;
and when he becomes a bull and is sacrificed, his spiritual part passes into a pair of Persea
trees. The Yarucaris of Bolivia say that a girl once bewailed in the forest her loverless estate.
She happened to notice a beautiful tree, which she adorned with ornaments as well as she might.
The tree assumed the shape of a handsome young man--

     She did not find him so remiss,
     But, lightly issuing through,
     He did repay her kiss for kiss,
     With usury thereto.(3)

J. G. Muller, who quotes this tale from Andree, says it has "many analogies with the tales
of metamorphosis of human beings into trees among the ancients, as reported by Ovid". The worship
of plants and trees is a well-known feature in religion, and probably implies (at least in
many cases) a recognition of personality. In Samoa, metamorphosis into vegetables is not uncommon.
For example, the king of Fiji was a cannibal, and (very naturally) "the people were melting
away under him". The brothers Toa and Pale, wishing to escape the royal oven, adopted various
changes of shape. They knew that straight timber was being sought for to make a canoe for the
king, so Pale, when he assumed a vegetable form, became a crooked stick overgrown with creepers,
but Toa "preferred standing erect as a handsome straight tree". Poor Toa was therefore cut
down by the king's shipwrights, though, thanks to his brother's magic wiles, they did not make
a canoe out of him after all.(4) In Samoa the trees are so far human that they not only go
to war with each other, but actually embark in canoes to seek out distant enemies.(5) The Ottawa
Indians account for the origin of maize by a myth in which a wizard fought with and conquered
a little man who had a little crown of feathers. From his ashes arose the maize with its crown
of leaves and heavy ears of corn.(6)

In Mangaia the myth of the origin of the cocoa-nut tree is a series of transformation scenes,
in which the persons shift shapes with the alacrity of medicine-men. Ina used to bathe in a
pool where an eel became quite familiar with her. At last the fish took courage and made his
declaration. He was Tuna, the chief of all eels. "Be mine," he cried, and Ina was his. For
some mystical reason he was obliged to leave her, but (like the White Cat in the fairy tale)
he requested her to cut off his eel's head and bury it. Regretfully but firmly did Ina comply
with his request, and from the buried eel's head sprang two cocoa trees, one from each half
of the brain of Tuna. As a proof of this be it remarked, that when the nut is husked we always
find on it "the two eyes and mouth of the lover of Ina".(1) All over the world, from ancient
Egypt to the wigwams of the Algonkins, plants and other matters are said to have sprung from
a dismembered god or hero, while men are said to have sprung from plants.(2) We may therefore
perhaps look on it as a proved point that the general savage habit of "levelling up" prevails
even in their view of the vegetable world, and has left traces (as we have seen) in their myths.

(1) Gill, Myths and Songs, p. 79.

(2) Myths of the Beginning of Things.

Turning now to the mythology of Greece, we see that the same rule holds good. Metamorphosis
into plants and flowers is extremely common; the instances of Daphne, Myrrha, Hyacinth, Narcissus
and the sisters of Phaethon at once occur to the memory.

Most of those myths in which everything in Nature becomes personal and human, while all persons
may become anything in Nature, we explain, then, as survivals or imitations of tales conceived
when men were in the savage intellectual condition. In that stage, as we demonstrated, no line
is drawn between things animate and inanimate, dumb or "articulate speaking," organic or inorganic,
personal or impersonal. Such a mental stage, again, is reflected in the nature-myths, many
of which are merely "aetiological,"--assign a cause, that is, for phenomena, and satisfy an
indolent and credulous curiosity.

We may be asked again, "But how did this intellectual condition come to exist?" To answer that
is no part of our business; for us it is enough to trace myth, or a certain element in myth,
to a demonstrable and actual stage of thought. These powers of effecting metamorphosis, of
"shape-shifting," of flying, of becoming invisible at will, of conversing with the dead, of
miraculously healing the sick, savages pass on to their gods (as will be shown in a later chapter),
and the gods of myth survive and retain the miraculous gifts after their worshippers (become
more reasonable) have quite forgotten that they themselves once claimed similar endowments.
So far, then, it has been shown that savage fancy, wherever studied, is wild; that savage curiosity
is keen; that savage credulity is practically boundless. These considerations explain the existence
of savage myths of sun, stars, beasts, plants and stones; similar myths fill Greek legend and
the Sanskrit Brahmanes. We conclude that, in Greek and Sanskrit, the myths are relics (whether
borrowed or inherited) of the savage mental STATUS.

The difficulties of classification which beset the study of mythology have already been described.
Nowhere are they more perplexing than when we try to classify what may be styled Cosmogonic
Myths. The very word cosmogonic implies the pre-existence of the idea of a cosmos, an orderly
universe, and this was exactly the last idea that could enter the mind of the myth-makers.
There is no such thing as orderliness in their mythical conceptions, and no such thing as an
universe. The natural question, "Who made the world, or how did the things in the world come
to be?" is the question which is answered by cosmogonic myths. But it is answered piecemeal.
To a Christian child the reply is given, "God made all things". We have known this reply discussed
by some little girls of six (a Scotch minister's daughters, and naturally metaphysical), one
of whom solved all difficulties by the impromptu myth, "God first made a little place to stand
on, and then he made the rest". But savages and the myth-makers, whose stories survive into
the civilised religions, could adhere firmly to no such account as this. Here occurs in the
first edition of this book the following passage: "They (savages) have not, and had not, the
conception of God as we understand what we mean by the word. They have, and had at most, only
the small-change of the idea God,"--here the belief in a moral being who watches conduct; here
again the hypothesis of a pre-human race of magnified, non-natural medicine-men, or of extra-natural
beings with human and magical attributes, but often wearing the fur, and fins, and feathers
of the lower animals. Mingled with these faiths (whether earlier, later, or coeval in origin
with these) are the dread and love of ancestral ghosts, often transmuting themselves into worship
of an imaginary and ideal first parent of the tribe, who once more is often a beast or a bird.
Here is nothing like the notion of an omnipotent, invisible, spiritual being, the creator of
our religion; here is only la monnaie of the conception."

It ought to have occurred to the author that he was here traversing the main theory of his
own book, which is that RELIGION is one thing, myth quite another thing. That many low races
of savages entertain, in hours of RELIGIOUS thought, an elevated conception of a moral and
undying Maker of Things, and Master of Life, a Father in Heaven, has already been stated, and
knowledge of the facts has been considerably increased since this work first appeared (1887).
But the MYTHICAL conceptions described in the last paragraph coexist with the religious conception
in the faiths of very low savages, such as the Australians and Andamanese, just as the same
contradictory coexistence is notorious in ancient Greece, India, Egypt and Anahuac. In a sense,
certain low savages HAVE the "conception of God, as we understand what we mean by the word".
But that sense, when savages come to spinning fables about origins, is apt to be overlaid and
perplexed by the frivolity of their mythical fancy.

With such shifting, grotesque and inadequate fables, the cosmogonic myths of the world are
necessarily bewildered and perplexed. We have already seen in the chapter on "Nature Myths"
that many things, sun, moon, the stars, "that have another birth," and various animals and
plants, are accounted for on the hypothesis that they are later than the appearance of man--that
they originally WERE men. To the European mind it seems natural to rank myths of the gods before
myths of the making or the evolution of the world, because our religion, like that of the more
philosophic Greeks, makes the deity the fount of all existences, causa causans, "what unmoved
moves," the beginning and the end. But the myth-makers, deserting any such ideas they may possess,
find it necessary, like the child of whom we spoke, to postulate a PLACE for the divine energy
to work from, and that place is the earth or the heavens. Then, again, heaven and earth are
themselves often regarded in the usual mythical way, as animated, as persons with parts and
passions, and finally, among advancing races, as gods. Into this medley of incongruous and
inconsistent conceptions we must introduce what order we may, always remembering that the order
is not native to the subject, but is brought in for the purpose of study.

The origin of the world and of man is naturally a problem which has excited the curiosity of
the least developed minds. Every savage race has its own myths on this subject, most of them
bearing the marks of the childish and crude imagination, whose character we have investigated,
and all varying in amount of what may be called philosophical thought.

All the cosmogonic myths, as distinct from religious belief in a Creator, waver between the
theory of construction, or rather of reconstruction, and the theory of evolution, very rudely
conceived. The earth, as a rule, is mythically averred to have grown out of some original matter,
perhaps an animal, perhaps an egg which floated on the waters, perhaps a handful of mud from
below the waters. But this conception does not exclude the idea that many of the things in
the world, minerals, plants and what not, are fragments of the frame of a semi-supernatural
and gigantic being, human or bestial, belonging to a race which preceded the advent of man.(1)
Such were the Titans, demi-gods, Nurrumbunguttias in Australia. Various members of this race
are found active in myths of the creation, or rather the construction, of man and of the world.
Among the lowest races it is to be noted that mythical animals of supernatural power often
take the place of beings like the Finnish Wainamoinen, the Greek Prometheus, the Zulu Unkulunkulu,
the Red Indian Manabozho, himself usually a great hare.

(1) Macrobius, Saturnal., i. xx.

The ages before the development or creation of man are filled up, in the myths, with the loves
and wars of supernatural people. The appearance of man is explained in three or four contradictory
ways, each of which is represented in the various myths of most mythologies. Often man is fashioned
out of clay, or stone, or other materials, by a Maker of all things, sometimes half-human or
bestial, but also half-divine. Sometimes the first man rises out of the earth, and is himself
confused with the Creator, a theory perhaps illustrated by the Zulu myth of Unkulunkulu, "The
Old, Old One". Sometimes man arrives ready made, with most of the animals, from his former
home in a hole in the ground, and he furnishes the world for himself with stars, sun, moon
and everything else he needs. Again, there are many myths which declare that man was evolved
out of one or other of the lower animals. This myth is usually employed by tribesmen to explain
the origin of their own peculiar stock of kindred. Once more, man is taken to be the fruit
of some tree or plant, or not to have emerged ready-made, but to have grown out of the ground
like a plant or a tree. In some countries, as among the Bechuanas, the Boeotians, and the Peruvians,
the spot where men first came out on earth is known to be some neighbouring marsh or cave.
Lastly, man is occasionally represented as having been framed out of a piece of the body of
the Creator, or made by some demiurgic potter out of clay. All these legends are told by savages,
with no sense of their inconsistency. There is no single orthodoxy on the matter, and we shall
see that all these theories coexist pell-mell among the mythological traditions of civilised
races. In almost every mythology, too, the whole theory of the origin of man is crossed by
the tradition of a Deluge, or some other great destruction, followed by revival or reconstruction
of the species, a tale by no means necessarily of Biblical origin.

In examining savage myths of the origin of man and of the world, we shall begin by considering
those current among the most backward peoples, where no hereditary or endowed priesthood has
elaborated and improved the popular beliefs. The natives of Australia furnish us with myths
of a purely popular type, the property, not of professional priests and poets, but of all the
old men and full-grown warriors of the country. Here, as everywhere else, the student must
be on his guard against accepting myths which are disguised forms of missionary teaching.(1)

(1) Taplin, The Narrinyeri. "He must also beware of supposing that the Australians believe
in a creator in our sense, because the Narrinyeri, for example, say that Nurundere 'made everything'.
Nurundere is but an idealised wizard and hunter, with a rival of his species." This occurs
in the first edition, but "making all things" is one idea, wizardry is another.

In Southern Australia we learn that the Boonoorong, an Australian coast tribe, ascribe the
creation of things to a being named Bun-jel or Pund-jel. He figures as the chief of an earlier
supernatural class of existence, with human relationships; thus he "has a wife, WHOSE FACE
HE HAS NEVER SEEN," brothers, a son, and so on. Now this name Bun-jel means "eagle-hawk," and
the eagle-hawk is a totem among certain stocks. Thus, when we hear that Eagle-hawk is the maker
of men and things we are reminded of the Bushman creator, Cagn, who now receives prayers of
considerable beauty and pathos, but who is (in some theories) identified with kaggen, the mantis
insect, a creative grasshopper, and the chief figure in Bushman mythology.(1) Bun-jel or Pund-jel
also figures in Australian belief, neither as the creator nor as the eagle-hawk, but "as an
old man who lives at the sources of the Yarra river, where he possesses great multitudes of
cattle".(2) The term Bun-jel is also used, much like our "Mr.," to denote the older men of
the Kurnai and Briakolung, some of whom have magical powers. One of them, Krawra, or "West
Wind," can cause the wind to blow so violently as to prevent the natives from climbing trees;
this man has semi-divine attributes. From these facts it appears that this Australian creator,
in myth, partakes of the character of the totem or worshipful beast, and of that of the wizard
or medicine-man. He carried a large knife, and, when he made the earth, he went up and down
slicing it into creeks and valleys. The aborigines of the northern parts of Victoria seem to
believe in Pund-jel in what may perhaps be his most primitive mythical shape, that of an eagle.(3)
This eagle and a crow created everything, and separated the Murray blacks into their two main
divisions, which derive their names from the crow and the eagle. The Melbourne blacks seem
to make Pund-jel more anthropomorphic. Men are his (Greek text omitted) figures kneaded of
clay, as Aristophanes says in the Birds. Pund-jel made two clay images of men, and danced round
them. "He made their hair--one had straight, one curly hair--of bark. He danced round them.
He lay on them, and breathed his breath into their mouths, noses and navels, and danced round
them. Then they arose full-grown young men." Some blacks seeing a brickmaker at work on a bridge
over the Yarra exclaimed, "Like 'em that Pund-jel make 'em Koolin". But other blacks prefer
to believe that, as Pindar puts the Phrygian legend, the sun saw men growing like trees.

The first man was formed out of the gum of a wattle-tree, and came out of the knot of a wattle-tree.
He then entered into a young woman (though he was the first man) and was born.(1) The Encounter
Bay people have another myth, which might have been attributed by Dean Swift to the Yahoos,
so foul an origin does it allot to mankind.

(1) Meyer, Aborigines of Encounter Bay. See, later, "Gods of the Lowest Races".

Australian myths of creation are by no means exclusive of a hypothesis of evolution. Thus the
Dieyrie, whose notions Mr. Gason has recorded, hold a very mixed view. They aver that "the
good spirit" Moora-Moora made a number of small black lizards, liked them, and promised them
dominion. He divided their feet into toes and fingers, gave them noses and lips, and set them
upright. Down they fell, and Moora-Moora cut off their tails. Then they walked erect and were
men.(1) The conclusion of the adventures of one Australian creator is melancholy. He has ceased
to dwell among mortals whom he watches and inspires. The Jay possessed many bags full of wind;
he opened them, and Pund-jel was carried up by the blast into the heavens. But this event did
not occur before Pund-jel had taught men and women the essential arts of life. He had shown
the former how to spear kangaroos, he still exists and inspires poets. From the cosmogonic
myths of Australia (the character of some of which is in contradiction with the higher religious
belief of the people to be later described) we may turn, without reaching a race of much higher
civilisation, to the dwellers in the Andaman Islands and their opinions about the origin of things.

(1) Gason's Dieyries, ap. Native Tribes of South Australia, p. 20.

The Andaman Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, are remote from any shores, and are protected from
foreign influences by dangerous coral reefs, and by the reputed ferocity and cannibalism of
the natives. These are Negritos, and are commonly spoken of as most abject savages. They are
not, however, without distinctions of rank; they are clean, modest, moral after marriage, and
most strict in the observance of prohibited degrees. Unlike the Australians, they use bows
and arrows, but are said to be incapable of striking a light, and, at all events, find the
process so difficult that, like the Australians and the farmer in the Odyssey,(1) they are
compelled "to hoard the seeds of fire". Their mythology contains explanations of the origin
of men and animals, and of their own customs and language.

(1) Odyssey, v. 490.

The Andamanese, long spoken of as "godless," owe much to Mr. Man, an English official, who
has made a most careful study of their beliefs.(1) So extraordinary is the contradiction between
the relative purity and morality of the RELIGION and the savagery of the myths of the Andamanese,
that, in the first edition of this work, I insisted that the "spiritual god" of the faith must
have been "borrowed from the same quarter as the stone house" in which he is mythically said
to live. But later and wider study, and fresh information from various quarters, have convinced
me that the relative purity of Andamanese religion, with its ethical sanction of conduct, may
well be, and probably is, a natural unborrowed development. It is easy for MYTH to borrow the
notion of a stone house from our recent settlement at Port Blair. But it would not be easy
for RELIGION to borrow many new ideas from an alien creed, in a very few years, while the noted
ferocity of the islanders towards strangers, and the inaccessibility of their abode, makes
earlier borrowing, on a large scale at least, highly improbable. The Andamanese god, Puluga,
is "like fire" but invisible, unborn and immortal, knowing and punishing or rewarding, men's
deeds, even "the thoughts of their hearts". But when once mythical fancy plays round him, and
stories are told about him, he is credited with a wife who is an eel or a shrimp, just as Zeus
made love as an ant or a cuckoo. Puluga was the maker of men; no particular myth as to how
he made them is given. They tried to kill him, after the deluge (of which a grotesque myth
is told), but he replied that he was "as hard as wood". His legend is in the usual mythical
contradiction with the higher elements in his religion.

(1) Journ. Anthrop. Soc., vol. xii. p. 157 et seq.

Leaving the Andaman islanders, but still studying races in the lowest degree of civilisation,
we come to the Bushmen of South Africa. This very curious and interesting people, far inferior
in material equipment to the Hottentots, is sometimes regarded as a branch of that race.(1)
The Hottentots call themselves "Khoi-khoi," the Bushmen they style "Sa". The poor Sa lead the
life of pariahs, and are hated and chased by all other natives of South Africa. They are hunters
and diggers for roots, while the Hottentots, perhaps their kinsmen, are cattle-breeders.(2)
Being so ill-nourished, the Bushmen are very small, but sturdy. They dwell in, or rather wander
through, countries which have been touched by some ancient civilisation, as is proved by the
mysterious mines and roads of Mashonaland. It is singular that the Bushmen possess a tradition
according to which they could once "make stone things that flew over rivers". They have remarkable
artistic powers, and their drawings of men and animals on the walls of caves are often not
inferior to the designs on early Greek vases.(3)

(1) See "Divine Myths of the Lower Races".

(2) Hahu, Tsuni Goam, p. 4. See other accounts in Waitz, Anthropologie, ii. 328.

(3) Custom and Myth, where illustrations of Bushman art are given, pp. 290-295.

Thus we must regard the Bushmen as possibly degenerated from a higher status, though there
is nothing (except perhaps the tradition about bridge-making) to show that it was more exalted
than that of their more prosperous neighbours, the Hottentots. The myths of the Bushmen, however,
are almost on the lowest known level. A very good and authentic example of Bushman cosmogonic
myth was given to Mr. Orpen, chief magistrate of St. John's territory, by Qing, King Nqusha's
huntsman. Qing "had never seen a white man, but in fighting," till he became acquainted with
Mr. Orpen.(1) The chief force in Bushmen myth is by Dr. Bleek identified with the mantis, a
sort of large grasshopper. Though he seems at least as "chimerical a beast" as the Aryan creative
boar, the "mighty big hare" of the Algonkins, the large spider who made the world in the opinion
of the Gold Coast people, or the eagle of the Australians, yet the insect (if insect he be),
like the others, has achieved moral qualities and is addressed in prayer. In his religious
aspect he is nothing less than a grasshopper. He is called Cagn. "Cagn made all things and
we pray to him," said Qing. "Coti is the wife of Cagn." Qing did not know where they came from;
"perhaps with the men who brought the sun". The fact is, Qing "did not dance that dance," that
is, was not one of the Bushmen initiated into the more esoteric mysteries of Cagn. Till we,
too, are initiated, we can know very little of Cagn in his religious aspect. Among the Bushmen,
as among the Greeks, there is "no religious mystery without dancing". Qing was not very consistent.
He said Cagn gave orders and caused all things to appear and to be made, sun, moon, stars,
wind, mountains, animals, and this, of course, is a lofty theory of creation. Elsewhere myth
avers that Cagn did not so much create as manufacture the objects in nature. In his early day
"the snakes were also men". Cagn struck snakes with his staff and turned them into men, as
Zeus, in the Aeginetan myth, did with ants. He also turned offending men into baboons. In Bushman
myth, little as we really know of it, we see the usual opposition of fable and faith, a kind
creator in religion is apparently a magician in myth.

(1) Cape Monthly Magazine, July, 1874.

Neighbours of the Bushmen, but more fortunate in their wealth of sheep and cattle, are the
Ovaherero. The myths of the Ovaherero, a tribe dwelling in a part of Hereraland "which had
not yet been under the influence of civilisation and Christianity," have been studied by the
Rev. H. Reiderbecke, missionary at Otyozondyupa. The Ovaherero, he says, have a kind of tree
Ygdrasil, a tree out of which men are born, and this plays a great part in their myth of creation.
The tree, which still exists, though at a great age, is called the Omumborombonga tree. Out
of it came, in the beginning, the first man and woman. Oxen stepped forth from it too, but
baboons, as Caliban says of the stars, "came otherwise," and sheep and goats sprang from a
flat rock. Black people are so coloured, according to the Ovaherero, because when the first
parents emerged from the tree and slew an ox, the ancestress of the blacks appropriated the
black liver of the victim. The Ovakuru Meyuru or "OLD ONES in heaven," once let the skies down
with a run, but drew them up again (as the gods of the Satapatha Brahmana drew the sun) when
most of mankind had been drowned.(1) The remnant pacified the OLD ONES (as Odysseus did the
spirits of the dead) by the sacrifice of a BLACK ewe, a practice still used to appease ghosts
by the Ovaherero. The neighbouring Omnambo ascribe the creation of man to Kalunga, who came
out of the earth, and made the first three sheep.(2)

Among the Namaquas, an African people on the same level of nomadic culture as the Ovaherero,
a divine or heroic early being called Heitsi Eibib had a good deal to do with the origin of
things. If he did not exactly make the animals, he impressed on them their characters, and
their habits (like those of the serpent in Genesis) are said to have been conferred by a curse,
the curse of Heitsi Eibib. A precisely similar notion was found by Avila among the Indians
of Huarochiri, whose divine culture-hero imposed, by a curse or a blessing, their character
and habits on the beasts.(1) The lion used to live in a nest up a tree till Heitsi Eibib cursed
him and bade him walk on the ground. He also cursed the hare, "and the hare ran away, and is
still running".(2) The name of the first man is given as Eichaknanabiseb (with a multitude
of "clicks"), and he is said to have met all the animals on a flat rock, and played a game
with them for copper beads. The rainbow was made by Gaunab, who is generally a malevolent being,
of whom more hereafter.

Leaving these African races, which, whatever their relative degrees of culture, are physically
somewhat contemptible, we reach their northern neighbours, the Zulus. They are among the finest,
and certainly among the least religious, of the undeveloped peoples. Their faith is mainly
in magic and ghosts, but there are traces of a fading and loftier belief.

The social and political condition of the Zulu is well understood. They are a pastoral, but
not a nomadic people, possessing large kraals or towns. They practise agriculture, and they
had, till quite recently, a centralised government and a large army, somewhat on the German
system. They appear to have no regular class of priests, and supernatural power is owned by
the chiefs and the king, and by diviners and sorcerers, who conduct the sacrifices. Their myths
are the more interesting because, whether from their natural scepticism, which confuted Bishop
Colenso in his orthodox days, or from acquaintance with European ideas, they have begun to
doubt the truth of their own traditions.(1) The Zulu theory of the origin of man and of the
world commences with the feats of Unkulunkulu, "the old, old one," who, in some legends, was
the first man, "and broke off in the beginning". Like Manabozho among the Indians of North
America, and like Wainamoinen among the Finns, Unkulunkulu imparted to men a knowledge of the
arts, of marriage, and so forth. His exploits in this direction, however, must be considered
in another part of this work. Men in general "came out of a bed of reeds".(2) But there is
much confusion about this bed of reeds, named "Uthlanga". The younger people ask where the
bed of reeds was; the old men do not know, and neither did their fathers know. But they stick
to it that "that bed of reeds still exists". Educated Zulus appear somewhat inclined to take
the expression in an allegorical sense, and to understand the reeds either as a kind of protoplasm
or as a creator who was mortal. "He exists no longer. As my grandfather no longer exists, he
too no longer exists; he died." Chiefs who wish to claim high descent trace their pedigree
to Uthlanga, as the Homeric kings traced theirs to Zeus. The myths given by Dr. Callaway are
very contradictory.

(1) These legends have been carefully collected and published by Bishop Callaway (Trubner &
Co., 1868).

(2) Callaway, p. 9.

In addition to the legend that men came out of a bed of reeds, other and perhaps even more
puerile stories are current. "Some men say that they were belched up by a cow;" others "that
Unkulunkulu split them out of a stone,"(1) which recalls the legend of Pyrrha and Deucalion.
The myth about the cow is still applied to great chiefs. "He was not born; he was belched up
by a cow." The myth of the stone origin corresponds to the Homeric saying about men "born from
the stone or the oak of the old tale".(2)

(1) Without anticipating a later chapter, the resemblances of these to Greek myths, as arrayed
by M. Bouche Leclercq (De Origine Generis Humani), is very striking.

(2) Odyssey, xix. 103.

In addition to the theory of the natal bed of reeds, the Zulus, like the Navajoes of New Mexico,
and the Bushmen, believe in the subterranean origin of man. There was a succession of emigrations
from below of different tribes of men, each having its own Unkulunkulu. All accounts agree
that Unkulunkulu is not worshipped, and he does not seem to be identified with "the lord who
plays in heaven"--a kind of fading Zeus--when there is thunder. Unkulunkulu is not worshipped,
though ancestral spirits are worshipped, because he lived so long ago that no one can now trace
his pedigree to the being who is at once the first man and the creator. His "honour-giving
name is lost in the lapse of years, and the family rites have become obsolete."(1)

(1) See Zulu religion in The Making of Religion, pp. 225-229, where it is argued that ghost
worship has superseded a higher faith, of which traces are discernible.

The native races of the North American continent (concerning whose civilisation more will be
said in the account of their divine myths) occupy every stage of culture, from the truly bestial
condition in which some of the Digger Indians at present exist, living on insects and unacquainted
even with the use of the bow, to the civilisation which the Spaniards destroyed among the Aztecs.

The original facts about religion in America are much disputed, and will be more appropriately
treated later. It is now very usual for anthropologists to say, like Mr. Dorman, "no approach
to monotheismn had been made before the discovery of America by Europeans, and the Great Spirit
mentioned in these (their) books is an introduction by Christianity".(1) "This view will not
bear examination," says Mr. Tylor, and we shall later demonstrate the accuracy of his remark.(2)
But at present we are concerned, not with what Indian religion had to say about her Gods, but
with what Indian myth had to tell about the beginnings of things.

The Hurons, for example (to choose a people in a state of middle barbarism), start in myth
from the usual conception of a powerful non-natural race of men dwelling in the heavens, whence
they descended, and colonised, not to say constructed, the earth. In the Relation de la Nouvelle
France, written by Pere Paul le Jeune, of the Company of Jesus, in 1636, there is a very full
account of Huron opinion, which, with some changes of names, exists among the other branches
of the Algonkin family of Indians.

They recognise as the founder of their kindred a woman named Ataentsic, who, like Hephaestus
in the Iliad, was banished from the sky. In the upper world there are woods and plains, as
on earth. Ataentsic fell down a hole when she was hunting a bear, or she cut down a heaven-tree,
and fell with the fall of this Huron Ygdrasil, or she was seduced by an adventurer from the
under world, and was tossed out of heaven for her fault. However it chanced, she dropped on
the back of the turtle in the midst of the waters. He consulted the other aquatic animals,
and one of them, generally said to have been the musk-rat, fished(1) up some soil and fashioned
the earth.(2) Here Ataentsic gave birth to twins, Ioskeha and Tawiscara. These represent the
usual dualism of myth; they answer to Osiris and Set, to Ormuzd and Ahriman, and were bitter
enemies. According to one form of the myth, the woman of the sky had twins, and what occurred
may be quoted from Dr. Brinton. "Even before birth one of them betrayed his restless and evil
nature by refusing to be born in the usual manner, but insisting on breaking through his parent's
side or arm-pit. He did so, but it cost his mother her life. Her body was buried, and from
it sprang the various vegetable productions," pumpkins, maize, beans, and so forth.(3)

(1) Relations, 1633. In this myth one Messon, the Great Hare, is the beginner of our race.
He married a daughter of the Musk-rat.

(2) Here we first meet in this investigation a very widely distributed myth. The myths already
examined have taken the origin of earth for granted. The Hurons account for its origin; a speck
of earth was fished out of the waters and grew. In M. H. de Charencey's tract Une Legende Cosmogonique
(Havre, 1884) this legend is traced. M. de Charencey distinguishes (1) a continental version;
(2) an insular version; (3) a mixed and Hindoo version. Among continental variants he gives
a Vogul version (Revue de Philologie et d'Ethnographie, Paris, 1874, i. 10). Numi Tarom (a
god who cooks fish in heaven) hangs a male and female above the abyss of waters in a silver
cradle. He gives them, later, just earth enough to build a house on. Their son, in the guise
of a squirrel, climbs to Numi Tarom, and receives from him a duck-skin and a goose-skin. Clad
in these, like Yehl in his raven-skin or Odin in his hawk-skin, he enjoys the powers of the
animals, dives and brings up three handfuls of mud, which grow into our earth. Elempi makes
men out of clay and snow. The American version M. de Charencey gives from Nicholas Perrot (Mem.
sur les Moers, etc., Paris, 1864, i. 3). Perrot was a traveller of the seventeenth century.
The Great Hare takes a hand in the making of earth out of fished-up soil. After giving other
North American variants, and comparing the animals that, after three attempts, fish up earth
to the dove and raven of Noah, M. de Charencey reaches the Bulgarians. God made Satan, in the
skin of a diver, fish up earth out of Lake Tiberias. Three doves fish up earth, in the beginning,
in the Galician popular legend (Chodzko, Contes des Paysans Slaves, p. 374). In the INSULAR
version, as in New Zealand, the island is usually fished up with a hook by a heroic angler
(Japan, Tonga, Tahiti, New Zealand). The Hindoo version, in which the boar plays the part of
musk-rat, or duck, or diver, will be given in "Indian Cosmogonic Myths".

(3) Brinton, American Hero-Myths, p. 54. Nicholas Perrot and various Jesuit Relations are the
original authorities. See "Divine Myths of America". Mr. Leland, in his Algonkin Tales, prints
the same story, with the names altered to Glooskap and Malsumis, from oral tradition. Compare
Schoolcraft, v. 155, and i. 317, and the versions of PP. Charlevoix and Lafitau. In Charlevoix
the good and bad brothers are Manabozho and Chokanipok or Chakekanapok, and out of the bones
and entrails of the latter many plants and animals were fashioned, just as, according to a
Greek myth preserved by Clemens Alexandrinus, parsley and pomegranates arose from the blood
and scattered members of Dionysus Zagreus. The tale of Tawiscara's violent birth is told of
Set in Egypt, and of Indra in the Veda, as will be shown later. This is a very common fable,
and, as Mr. Whitley Stokes tells me, it recurs in old Irish legends of the birth of our Lord,
Myth, as usual, invading religion, even Christian religion.

According to another version of the origin of things, the maker of them was one Michabous,
or Michabo, the Great Hare. His birthplace was shown at an island called Michilimakinak, like
the birthplace of Apollo at Delos. The Great Hare made the earth, and, as will afterwards appear,
was the inventor of the arts of life. On the whole, the Iroquois and Algonkin myths agree in
finding the origin of life in an upper world beyond the sky. The earth was either fished up
(as by Brahma when he dived in the shape of a boar) by some beast which descended to the bottom
of the waters, or grew out of the tortoise on whose back Ataentsic fell. The first dwellers
in the world were either beasts like Manabozho or Michabo, the Great Hare, or the primeval
wolves of the Uinkarets,(1) or the creative musk-rat, or were more anthropomorphic heroes,
such as Ioskeha and Tawiscara. As for the things in the world, some were made, some evolved,
some are transformed parts of an early non-natural man or animal. There is a tendency to identify
Ataentsic, the sky-woman, with the moon, and in the Two Great Brethren, hostile as they are,
to recognise moon and sun.(2)

(1) Powell, Bureau of Ethnology, i. 44.

(2) Dr. Brinton has endeavoured to demonstrate by arguments drawn from etymology that Michabos,
Messou, Missibizi or Manabozho, the Great Hare, is originally a personification of Dawn (Myths
of the New World, p. 178). I have examined his arguments in the Nineteenth Century, January,
1886, which may be consulted, and in Melusine, January, 1887. The hare appears to be one out
of the countless primeval beast-culture heroes. A curious piece of magic in a tradition of
the Dene Hareskins may seem to aid Dr. Brinton's theory: "Pendant la nuit il entra, jeta au
feu une tete de lievre blanc et aussitot le jour se fit".--Petitot, Traditions Indiennes, p.
173. But I take it that the sacrifice of a white hare's head makes light magically, as sacrifice
of black beasts and columns of black smoke make rainclouds.

Some of the degraded Digger Indians of California have the following myth of the origin of
species. In this legend, it will be noticed, a species of evolution takes the place of a theory
of creation. The story was told to Mr. Adam Johnston, who "drew" the narrator by communicating
to a chief the Biblical narrative of the creation.(1) The chief said it was a strange story,
and one that he had never heard when he lived at the Mission of St. John under the care of
a Padre. According to this chief (he ruled over the Po-to-yan-te tribe or Coyotes), the first
Indians were coyotes. When one of their number died, his body became full of little animals
or spirits. They took various shapes, as of deer, antelopes, and so forth; but as some exhibited
a tendency to fly off to the moon, the Po-to-yan-tes now usually bury the bodies of their dead,
to prevent the extinction of species. Then the Indians began to assume the shape of man, but
it was a slow transformation. At first they walked on all fours, then they would begin to develop
an isolated human feature, one finger, one toe, one eye, like the ascidian, our first parent
in the view of modern science. Then they doubled their organs, got into the habit of sitting
up, and wore away their tails, which they unaffectedly regret, "as they consider the tail quite
an ornament". Ideas of the immortality of the soul are said to be confined to the old women
of the tribe, and, in short, according to this version, the Digger Indians occupy the modern
scientific position.

(1) Schoolcraft, vol. v.

The Winnebagoes, who communicated their myths to Mr. Fletcher,(1) are suspected of having been
influenced by the Biblical narrative. They say that the Great Spirit woke up as from a dream,
and found himself sitting in a chair. As he was all alone, he took a piece of his body and
a piece of earth, and made a man. He next made a woman, steadied the earth by placing beasts
beneath it at the corners, and created plants and animals. Other men he made out of bears.
"He created the white man to make tools for the poor Indians"--a very pleasing example of a
teleological hypothesis and of the doctrine of final causes as understood by the Winnebagoes.
The Chaldean myth of the making of man is recalled by the legend that the Great Spirit cut
out a piece of himself for the purpose; the Chaldean wisdom coincides, too, with the philosophical
acumen of the Po-to-yan-te or Coyote tribe of Digger Indians. Though the Chaldean theory is
only connected with that of the Red Men by its savagery, we may briefly state it in this place.

(1) Ibid., iv. 228.

According to Berosus, as reported by Alexander Polyhistor, the universe was originally (as
before Manabozho's time) water and mud. Herein all manner of mixed monsters, with human heads,
goat's horns, four legs, and tails, bred confusedly. In place of the Iroquois Ataentsic, a
woman called Omoroca presided over the mud and the menagerie. She, too, like Ataentsic, is
sometimes recognised as the moon. Affairs being in this state, Bel-Maruduk arrived and cut
Omoroca in two (Chokanipok destroyed Ataentsic), and out of Omoroca Bel made the world and
the things in it. We have already seen that in savage myth many things are fashioned out of
a dead member of the extra-natural race. Lastly, Bel cut his own head off, and with the blood
the gods mixed clay and made men. The Chaldeans inherited very savage fancies.(1)

(1) Cf. Syncellus, p. 29; Euseb., Chronic. Armen., ed. Mai, p. 10; Lenormant, Origines de l'Histoire,
i. 506.

One ought, perhaps, to apologise to the Chaldeans for inserting their myths among the fables
of the least cultivated peoples; but it will scarcely be maintained that the Oriental myths
differ in character from the Digger Indian and Iroquois explanations of the origin of things.
The Ahts of Vancouver Island, whom Mr. Sproat knew intimately, and of whose ideas he gives
a cautious account (for he was well aware of the limits of his knowledge), tell a story of
the usual character.(1) They believe in a member of the extra-natural race, named Quawteaht,
of whom we shall hear more in his heroic character. As a demiurge "he is undoubtedly represented
as the general framer, I do not say creator, of all things, though some special things are
excepted. He made the earth and water, the trees and rocks, and all the animals. Some say that
Quawteaht made the sun and moon, but the majority of the Indians believe that he had nothing
to do with their formation, and that they are deities superior to himself, though now distant
and less active. He gave names to everything; among the rest, to all the Indian houses which
then existed, although inhabited only by birds and animals. Quawteaht went away before the
apparent change of the birds and beasts into Indians, which took place in the following manner:--

"The birds and beasts of old had the spirits of the Indians dwelling in them, and occupied
the various coast villages, as the Ahts do at present. One day a canoe manned by two Indians
from an unknown country approached the shore. As they coasted along, at each house at which
they landed, the deer, bear, elk, and other brute inhabitants fled to the mountains, and the
geese and other birds flew to the woods and rivers. But in this flight, the Indians, who had
hitherto been contained in the bodies of the various creatures, were left behind, and from
that time they took possession of the deserted dwellings and assumed the condition in which
we now see them."

Crossing the northern continent of America to the west, we are in the domains of various animal
culture-heroes, ancestors and teachers of the human race and the makers, to some extent, of
the things in the world. As the eastern tribes have their Great Hare, so the western tribes
have their wolf hero and progenitor, or their coyote, or their raven, or their dog. It is possible,
and even certain in some cases, that the animal which was the dominant totem of a race became
heir to any cosmogonic legends that were floating about.

The country of the Papagos, on the eastern side of the Gulf of California, is the southern
boundary of the province of the coyote or prairie wolf. The realm of his influence as a kind
of Prometheus, or even as a demiurge, extends very far northwards. In the myth related by Con
Quien, the chief of the central Papagos,(1) the coyote acts the part of the fish in the Sanskrit
legend of the flood, while Montezuma undertakes the role of Manu. This Montezuma was formed,
like the Adams of so many races, out of potter's clay in the hands of the Great Spirit. In
all this legend it seems plain enough that the name of Montezuma is imported from Mexico, and
has been arbitrarily given to the hero of the Papagos. According to Mr. Powers, whose manuscript
notes Mr. Bancroft quotes (iii. 87), all the natives of California believe that their first
ancestors were created directly from the earth of their present dwelling-places, and in very
many cases these ancestors were coyotes.

(1) Davidson, Indian Affairs Report, 1865, p. 131; Bancroft, iii. 75.

The Pimas, a race who live near the Papagos on the eastern coast of the Gulf of California,
say that the earth was made by a being named Earth-prophet. At first it appeared like a spider's
web, reminding one of the West African legend that a great spider created the world. Man was
made by the Earth-prophet out of clay kneaded with sweat. A mysterious eagle and a deluge play
a great part in the later mythical adventures of war and the world, as known to the Pimas.(1)

(1) Communicated to Mr. Bancroft by Mr. Stout of the Pima Agency.

In Oregon the coyote appears as a somewhat tentative demiurge, and the men of his creation,
like the beings first formed by Prajapati in the Sanskrit myth, needed to be reviewed, corrected
and considerably augmented. The Chinooks of Oregon believe in the usual race of magnified non-natural
men, who preceded humanity.

These semi-divine people were called Ulhaipa by the Chinooks, and Sehuiab by the Lummies. But
the coyote was the maker of men. As the first of Nature's journeymen, he made men rather badly,
with closed eyes and motionless feet. A kind being, named Ikanam, touched up the coyote's crude
essays with a sharp stone, opening the eyes of men, and giving their hands and feet the powers
of movement. He also acted as a "culture-hero," introducing the first arts. (1)

(1) (Frauchere's Narrative, 258; Gibb's Chinook Vocabulary; Parker's exploring Tour, i. 139;)
Bancroft, iii. 96.

Moving up the West Pacific coast we reach British Columbia, where the coyote is not supposed
to have been so active as our old friend the musk-rat in the great work of the creation. According
to the Tacullies, nothing existed in the beginning but water and a musk-rat. As the animal
sought his food at the bottom of the water, his mouth was frequently filled with mud. This
he spat out, and so gradually formed by alluvial deposit an island. This island was small at
first, like earth in the Sanskrit myth in the Satapatha Brahmana, but gradually increased in
bulk. The Tacullies have no new light to throw on the origin of man.(1)

(1) Bancroft, iii. 98; Harmon's Journey, pp. 302, 303.

The Thlinkeets, who are neighbours of the Tacullies on the north, incline to give crow or raven
the chief role in the task of creation, just as some Australians allot the same part to the
eagle-hawk, and the Yakuts to a hawk, a crow and a teal-duck. We shall hear much of Yehl later,
as one of the mythical heroes of the introduction of civilisation. North of the Thlinkeets,
a bird and a dog take the creative duties, the Aleuts and Koniagas being descended from a dog.
Among the more northern Tinnehs, the dog who was the progenitor of the race had the power of
assuming the shape of a handsome young man. He supplied the protoplasm of the Tinnehs, as Purusha
did that of the Aryan world, out of his own body. A giant tore him to pieces, as the gods tore
Purusha, and out of the fragments thrown into the rivers came fish, the fragments tossed into
the air took life as birds, and so forth.(1) This recalls the Australian myth of the origin
of fish and the Ananzi stories of the origin of whips.(2)

(1) Hearne, pp. 342, 343; Bancroft, iii. 106.

the Ananzi story.

Between the cosmogonic myths of the barbarous or savage American tribes and those of the great
cultivated American peoples, Aztecs, Peruvians and Quiches, place should be found for the legends
of certain races in the South Pacific. Of these, the most important are the Maoris or natives
of New Zealand, the Mangaians and the Samoans. Beyond the usual and world-wide correspondences
of myth, the divine tales of the various South Sea isles display resemblances so many and essential
that they must be supposed to spring from a common and probably not very distant centre. As
it is practically impossible to separate Maori myths of the making of things from Maori myths
of the gods and their origin, we must pass over here the metaphysical hymns and stories of
the original divine beings, Rangi and Papa, Heaven and Earth, and of their cruel but necessary
divorce by their children, who then became the usual Titanic race which constructs and "airs"
the world for the reception of man.(1) Among these beings, more fully described in our chapter
on the gods of the lower races, is Tiki, with his wife Marikoriko, twilight. Tane (male) is
another of the primordial race, children of earth and heaven, and between him and Tiki lies
the credit of having made or begotten humanity. Tane adorned the body of his father, heaven
(Rangi), by sticking stars all over it, as disks of pearl-shells are stuck all over images.
He was the parent of trees and birds, but some trees are original and divine beings. The first
woman was not born, but formed out of the sun and the echo, a pretty myth. Man was made by
Tiki, who took red clay, and kneaded it with his own blood, or with the red water of swamps.
The habits of animals, some of which are gods, while others are descended from gods, follow
from their conduct at the moment when heaven and earth were violently divorced. New Zealand
itself, or at least one of the isles, was a huge fish caught by Maui (of whom more hereafter).
Just as Pund-jel, in Australia, cut out the gullies and vales with his knife, so the mountains
and dells of New Zealand were produced by the knives of Maui's brothers when they crimped his
big fish.(2) Quite apart from those childish ideas are the astonishing metaphysical hymns about
the first stirrings of light in darkness, of "becoming" and "being," which remind us of Hegel
and Heraclitus, or of the most purely speculative ideas in the Rig-Veda.(3) Scarcely less metaphysical
are the myths of Mangaia, of which Mr. Gill(4) gives an elaborate account.

The Mangaian ideas of the world are complex, and of an early scientific sort. The universe
is like the hollow of a vast cocoa-nut shell, divided into many imaginary circles like those
of mediaeval speculation. There is a demon at the stem, as it were, of the cocoa-nut, and,
where the edges of the imaginary shell nearly meet, dwells a woman demon, whose name means
"the very beginning". In this system we observe efforts at metaphysics and physical speculation.
But it is very characteristic of rude thought that such extremely abstract conceptions as "the
very beginning" are represented as possessing life and human form. The woman at the bottom
of the shell was anxious for progeny, and therefore plucked a bit out of her own right side,
as Eve was made out of the rib of Adam. This piece of flesh became Vatea, the father of gods
and men. Vatea (like Oannes in the Chaldean legend) was half man, half fish. "The Very Beginning"
begat other children in the same manner, and some of these became departmental gods of ocean,
noon-day, and so forth. Curiously enough, the Mangaians seem to be sticklers for primogeniture.
Vatea, as the first-born son, originally had his domain next above that of his mother. But
she was pained by the thought that his younger brothers each took a higher place than his;
so she pushed his land up, and it is now next below the solid crust on which mortals live in
Mangaia. Vatea married a woman from one of the under worlds named Papa, and their children
had the regular human form. One child was born either from Papa's head, like Athene from the
head of Zeus, or from her armpit, like Dionysus from the thigh of Zeus. Another child may be
said, in the language of dog-breeders, to have "thrown back," for he wears the form of a white
or black lizard. In the Mangaian system the sky is a solid vault of blue stone. In the beginning
of things the sky (like Ouranos in Greece and Rangi in New Zealand) pressed hard on earth,
and the god Ru was obliged to thrust the two asunder, or rather he was engaged in this task
when Maui tossed both Ru and the sky so high up that they never came down again. Ru is now
the Atlas of Mangaia, "the sky-supporting Ru".(1) His lower limbs fell to earth, and became
pumice-stone. In these Mangaian myths we discern resemblances to New Zealand fictions, as is
natural, and the tearing of the body of "the Very Beginning" has numerous counterparts in European,
American and Indian fable. But on the whole, the Mangaian myths are more remarkable for their
semi-scientific philosophy than for their coincidences with the fancies of other early peoples.

(1) Gill, p. 59.

The Samoans, like the Maoris and Greeks, hold that heaven at first fell down and lay upon earth.(1)
The arrowroot and another plant pushed up heaven, and "the heaven-pushing place" is still known
and pointed out. Others say the god Ti-iti-i pushed up heaven, and his feet made holes six
feet deep in the rocks during this exertion. The other Samoan myths chiefly explain the origin
of fire, and the causes of the characteristic forms and habits of animals and plants. The Samoans,
too, possess a semi-mythical, metaphysical cosmogony, starting from NOTHING, but rapidly becoming
the history of rocks, clouds, hills, dew and various animals, who intermarried, and to whom
the royal family of Samoa trace their origin through twenty-three generations. So personal
are Samoan abstract conceptions, that "SPACE had a long-legged stool," on to which a head fell,
and grew into a companion for Space. Yet another myth says that the god Tangaloa existed in
space, and made heaven and earth, and sent down his daughter, a snipe. Man he made out of the
mussel-fish. So confused are the doctrines of the Samoans.(2)

Perhaps the cosmogonic myths of the less cultivated races have now been stated in sufficient
number. As an example of the ideas which prevailed in an American race of higher culture, we
may take the Quiche legend as given in the Popol Vuh, a post-Christian collection of the sacred
myths of the nation, written down after the Spanish conquest, and published in French by the
Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg.(1)

(1) See Popol Vuh in Mr. Max Muller's Chips from a German Workshop, with a discussion of its
authenticity. In his Annals of the Cakchiquels, a nation bordering on the Quiches, Dr. Brinton
expresses his belief in the genuine character of the text. Compare Bancroft, iii. p. 45. The
ancient and original Popol Vuh, the native book in native characters, disappeared during the
Spanish conquest.

The Quiches, like their neighbours the Cakchiquels, were a highly civilised race, possessing
well-built towns, roads and the arts of life, and were great agriculturists. Maize, the staple
of food among these advanced Americans, was almost as great a god as Soma among the Indo-Aryans.
The Quiches were acquainted with a kind of picture-writing, and possessed records in which
myth glided into history. The Popol Vuh, or book of the people, gives itself out as a post-Columbian
copy of these traditions, and may doubtless contain European ideas. As we see in the Commentarias
Reales of the half-blood Inca Garcilasso de la Vega, the conquered people were anxious to prove
that their beliefs were by no means so irrational and so "devilish" as to Spanish critics they
appeared. According to the Popol Vuh, there was in the beginning nothing but water and the
feathered serpent, one of their chief divine beings; but there also existed somehow, "they
that gave life". Their names mean "shooter of blow-pipe at coyote," "at opossum," and so forth.
They said "Earth," and there WAS earth, and plants growing thereon. Animals followed, and the
Givers of life said "Speak our names," but the animals could only cluck and croak. Then said
the Givers, "Inasmuch as ye cannot praise us, ye shall be killed and eaten". They then made
men out of clay; these men were weak and watery, and by water they were destroyed. Next they
made men of wood and women of the pith of trees. These puppets married and gave in marriage,
and peopled earth with wooden mannikins. This unsatisfactory race was destroyed by a rain of
resin and by the wild beasts. The survivors developed into apes. Next came a period occupied
by the wildest feats of the magnified non-natural race and of animals. The record is like the
description of a supernatural pantomime--the nightmare of a god. The Titans upset hills, are
turned into stone, and behave like Heitsi Eibib in the Namaqua myths.

Last of all, men were made of yellow and white maize, and these gave more satisfaction, but
their sight was contracted. These, however, survived, and became the parents of the present
stock of humanity.

Here we have the conceptions of creation and of evolution combined. Men are MADE, but only
the fittest survive; the rest are either destroyed or permitted to develop into lower species.
A similar mixture of the same ideas will be found in one of the Brahmanas among the Aryans
of India. It is to be observed that the Quiche myths, as recorded in Popol Vuh, contain not
only traces of belief in a creative word and power, but many hymns of a lofty and beautifully
devotional character.

"Hail! O Creator, O Former!

This is an example of the prayers of the men made out of maize, made especially that they might
"call on the name" of the god or gods. Whether we are to attribute this and similar passages
to Christian influence (for Popol Vuh, as we have it, is but an attempt to collect the fragments
of the lost book that remained in men's minds after the conquest), or whether the purer portions
of the myth be due to untaught native reflection and piety, it is not possible to determine.
It is improbable that the ideas of a hostile race would be introduced into religious hymns
by their victims. Here, as elsewhere in the sacred legends of civilised peoples, various strata
of mythical and religious thought coexist.

No American people reached such a pitch of civilisation as the Aztecs of Anahuac, whose capital
was the city of Mexico. It is needless here to repeat the story of their grandeur and their
fall. Obscure as their history, previous to the Spanish invasion, may be, it is certain that
they possessed a highly organised society, fortified towns, established colleges or priesthoods,
magnificent temples, an elaborate calendar, great wealth in the precious metals, the art of
picture-writing in considerable perfection, and a despotic central government. The higher classes
in a society like this could not but develop speculative systems, and it is alleged that shortly
before the reign of Montezuma attempts had been made to introduce a pure monotheistic religion.
But the ritual of the Aztecs remained an example of the utmost barbarity. Never was a more
cruel faith, not even in Carthage. Nowhere did temples reek with such pools of human blood;
nowhere else, not in Dahomey and Ashanti, were human sacrifice, cannibalism and torture so
essential to the cult that secured the favour of the gods. In these dark fanes--reeking with
gore, peopled by monstrous shapes of idols bird-headed or beast-headed, and adorned with the
hideous carvings in which we still see the priest, under the mask of some less ravenous forest
beast, tormenting the victim--in these abominable temples the Castilian conquerors might well
believe that they saw the dwellings of devils.

Yet Mexican religion had its moral and beautiful aspect, and the gods, or certain of the gods,
required from their worshippers not only bloody hands, but clean hearts.

To the gods we return later. The myths of the origin of things may be studied without a knowledge
of the whole Aztec Pantheon. Our authorities, though numerous, lack complete originality and
are occasionally confused. We have first the Aztec monuments and hieroglyphic scrolls, for
the most part undeciphered. These merely attest the hideous and cruel character of the deities.
Next we have the reports of early missionaries, like Sahagun and Mendieta, of conquerors, like
Bernal Diaz, and of noble half-breeds, such as Ixtlilxochitl.(1)

(1) Bancroft's Native Races of Pacific Coast of North America, vol. iii., contains an account
of the sources, and, with Sahagun and Acosta, is mainly followed here. See also J. G. Muller,
Ur. Amerik. Rel., p. 507. See chapter on the "Divine Myths of Mexico".

There are two elements in Mexican, as in Quiche, and Indo-Aryan, and Maori, and even Andaman
cosmogonic myth. We find the purer religion and the really philosophic speculation concurrent
with such crude and childish stories as usually satisfy the intellectual demands of Ahts, Cahrocs
and Bushmen; but of the purer and more speculative opinions we know little. Many of the noble,
learned and priestly classes of Aztecs perished at the conquest. The survivors were more or
less converted to Catholicism, and in their writings probably put the best face possible on
the native religion. Like the Spanish clergy, their instructors, they were inclined to explain
away their national gods by a system of euhemerism, by taking it for granted that the gods
and culture-heroes had originally been ordinary men, worshipped after their decease. This is
almost invariably the view adopted by Sahagun. Side by side with the confessions, as it were,
of the clergy and cultivated classes coexisted the popular beliefs, the myths of the people,
partaking of the nature of folk-lore, but not rejected by the priesthood.

Both strata of belief are represented in the surviving cosmogonic myths of the Aztecs. Probably
we may reckon in the first or learned and speculative class of tales the account of a series
of constructions and reconstructions of the world. This idea is not peculiar to the higher
mythologies, the notion of a deluge and recreation or renewal of things is almost universal,
and even among the untutored Australians there are memories of a flood and of an age of ruinous
winds. But the theory of definite epochs, calculated in accordance with the Mexican calendar,
of epochs in which things were made and re-made, answers closely to the Indo-Aryan conception
of successive kalpas, and can only have been developed after the method of reckoning time had
been carried to some perfection. "When heaven and earth were fashioned, they had already been
four times created and destroyed," say the fragments of what is called the Chimalpopoca manuscript.
Probably this theory of a series of kalpas is only one of the devices by which the human mind
has tried to cheat itself into the belief that it can conceive a beginning of things. The earth
stands on an elephant, the elephant on a tortoise, and it is going too far to ask what the
tortoise stands on. In the same way the world's beginning seems to become more intelligible
or less puzzling when it is thrown back into a series of beginnings and endings. This method
also was in harmony with those vague ideas of evolution and of the survival of the fittest
which we have detected in myth. The various tentative human races of the Popol Vuh degenerated
or were destroyed because they did not fulfil the purposes for which they were made. In Brahmanic
myth we shall see that type after type was condemned and perished because it was inadequate,
or inadequately equipped--because it did not harmonise with its environment.(1) For these series
of experimental creations and inefficient evolutions vast spaces of time were required, according
to the Aztec and Indo-Aryan philosophies. It is not impossible that actual floods and great
convulsions of nature may have been remembered in tradition, and may have lent colour and form
to these somewhat philosophic myths of origins. From such sources probably comes the Mexican
hypothesis of a water-age (ending in a deluge), an earth-age (ending in an earthquake), a wind-age
(ending in hurricanes), and the present dispensation, to be destroyed by fire.

(1) As an example of a dim evolutionary idea, note the myths of the various ages as reported
by Mendieta, according to which there were five earlier ages "or suns" of bad quality, so that
the contemporary human beings were unable to live on the fruits of the earth.

The less philosophic and more popular Aztec legend of the commencement of the world is mainly
remarkable for the importance given in it to objects of stone. For some reason, stones play
a much greater part in American than in other mythologies. An emerald was worshipped in the
temple of Pachacamac, who was, according to Garcilasso, the supreme and spiritual deity of
the Incas. The creation legend of the Cakchiquels of Guatemala(1) makes much of a mysterious,
primeval and animated obsidian stone. In the Iroquois myths(2) stones are the leading characters.
Nor did Aztec myth escape this influence.

There was a god in heaven named Citlalatonac, and a goddess, Citlalicue. When we speak of "heaven"
we must probably think of some such world of ordinary terrestrial nature above the sky as that
from which Ataentsic fell in the Huron story. The goddess gave birth to a flint-knife, and
flung the flint down to earth. This abnormal birth partly answers to that of the youngest of
the Adityas, the rejected abortion in the Veda, and to the similar birth and rejection of Maui
in New Zealand. From the fallen flint-knife sprang our old friends the magnified non-natural
beings with human characteristics, "the gods," to the number of 1600. The gods sent up the
hawk (who in India and Australia generally comes to the front on these occasions), and asked
their mother, or rather grandmother, to help them to make men, to be their servants. Citlalicue
rather jeered at her unconsidered offspring. She advised them to go to the lord of the homes
of the departed, Mictlanteuctli, and borrow a bone or some ashes of the dead who are with him.
We must never ask for consistency from myths. This statement implies that men had already been
in existence, though they were not yet created. Perhaps they had perished in one of the four
great destructions. With difficulty and danger the gods stole a bone from Hades, placed it
in a bowl, and smeared it with their own blood, as in Chaldea and elsewhere. Finally, a boy
and a girl were born out of the bowl. From this pair sprang men, and certain of the gods, jumping
into a furnace, became sun and moon. To the sun they then, in Aztec fashion, sacrificed themselves,
and there, one might think, was an end of them. But they afterwards appeared in wondrous fashions
to their worshippers, and ordained the ritual of religion. According to another legend, man
and woman (as in African myths) struggled out of a hole in the ground.(1)

The myths of the peoples under the empire of the Incas in Peru are extremely interesting, because
almost all mythical formations are found existing together, while we have historical evidence
as to the order and manner of their development. The Peru of the Incas covered the modern state
of the same name, and included Ecuador, with parts of Chili and Bolivia. M. Reville calculates
that the empire was about 2500 miles in length, four times as long as France, and that its
breadth was from 250 to 500 miles. The country, contained three different climatic regions,
and was peopled by races of many different degrees of culture, all more or less subject to
the dominion of the Children of the Sun. The three regions were the dry strip along the coast,
the fertile and cultivated land about the spurs of the Cordilleras, and the inland mountain
regions, inhabited by the wildest races. Near Cuzco, the Inca capital, was the Lake of Titicaca,
the Mediterranean, as it were, of Peru, for on the shores of this inland sea was developed
the chief civilisation of the new world.

As to the institutions, myths and religion of the empire, we have copious if contradictory
information. There are the narratives of the Spanish conquerors, especially of Pizarro's chaplain,
Valverde, an ignorant bigoted fanatic. Then we have somewhat later travellers and missionaries,
of whom Cieza de Leon (his book was published thirty years after the conquest, in 1553) is
one of the most trustworthy. The "Royal Commentaries" of Garcilasso de la Vega, son of an Inca
lady and a Spanish conqueror, have often already been quoted. The critical spirit and sound
sense of Garcilasso are in remarkable contrast to the stupid orthodoxy of the Spaniards, but
some allowance must be made for his fervent Peruvian patriotism. He had heard the Inca traditions
repeated in boyhood, and very early in life collected all the information which his mother
and maternal uncle had to give him, or which could be extracted from the quipus (the records
of knotted cord), and from the commemorative pictures of his ancestors. Garcilasso had access,
moreover, to the "torn papers" of Blas Valera, an early Spanish missionary of unusual sense
and acuteness. Christoval de Moluna is also an excellent authority, and much may be learned
from the volume of Rites and Laws of the Yncas.(1)

(1) A more complete list of authorities, including the garrulous Acosta, is published by M.
Reville in his Hibbert Lectures, pp. 136, 137. Garcilasso, Cieza de Leon, Christoval de Moluna,
Acosta and the Rites and Laws have all been translated by Mr. Clements Markham, and are published,
with the editor's learned and ingenious notes, in the collection of the Hakluyt Society. Care
must be taken to discriminate between what is reported about the Indians of the various provinces,
who were in very different grades of culture, and what is told about the Incas themselves.

The political and religious condition of the Peruvian empire is very clearly conceived and
stated by Garcilasso. Without making due allowance for that mysterious earlier civilisation,
older than the Incas, whose cyclopean buildings are the wonder of travellers, Garcilasso attributes
the introduction of civilisation to his own ancestors. Allowing for what is confessedly mythical
in his narrative, it must be admitted that he has a firm grasp of what the actual history must
have been. He recognises a period of savagery before the Incas, a condition of the rudest barbarism,
which still existed on the fringes and mountain recesses of the empire. The religion of that
period was mere magic and totemism. From all manner of natural objects, but chiefly from beasts
and birds, the various savage stocks of Peru claimed descent, and they revered and offered
sacrifice to their totemic ancestors.(1) Garcilasso adds, what is almost incredible, that the
Indians tamely permitted themselves to be eaten by their totems, when these were carnivorous
animals. They did this with the less reluctance as they were cannibals, and accustomed to breed
children for the purposes of the cuisine from captive women taken in war.(2) Among the huacas
or idols, totems, fetishes and other adorable objects of the Indians, worshipped before and
retained after the introduction of the Inca sun-totem and solar cult, Garcilasso names trees,
hills, rocks, caves, fountains, emeralds, pieces of jasper, tigers, lions, bears, foxes, monkeys,
condors, owls, lizards, toads, frogs, sheep, maize, the sea, "for want of larger gods, crabs"
and bats. The bat was also the totem of the Zotzil, the chief family of the Cakchiquels of
Guatemala, and the most high god of the Cakchiquels was worshipped in the shape of a bat. We
are reminded of religion as it exists in Samoa. The explanation of Blas Valera was that in
each totem (pacarissa) the Indians adored the devil.

(1) Com. Real., vol. i., chap. ix., x. xi. pp. 47-53.

(2) Cieza de Leon, xii., xv., xix., xxi., xxiii., xxvi., xxviii., xxxii. Cieza is speaking
of people in the valley of Cauca, in New Granada.

Athwart this early religion of totems and fetishes came, in Garcilasso's narrative, the purer
religion of the Incas, with what he regards as a philosophic development of a belief in a Supreme
Being. According to him, the Inca sun-worship was really a totemism of a loftier character.
The Incas "knew how to choose gods better than the Indians". Garcilasso's theory is that the
earlier totems were selected chiefly as distinguishing marks by the various stocks, though,
of course, this does not explain why the animals or other objects of each family were worshipped
or were regarded as ancestors, and the blood-connections of the men who adored them. The Incas,
disdaining crabs, lizards, bats and even serpents and lions, "chose" the sun. Then, just like
the other totemic tribes, they feigned to be of the blood and lineage of the sun.

This fable is, in brief, the Inca myth of the origin of civilisation and of man, or at least
of their breed of men. As M. Reville well remarks, it is obvious that the Inca claim is an
adaptation of the local myth of Lake Titicaca, the inland sea of Peru. According to that myth,
the Children of the Sun, the ancestors of the Incas, came out of the earth (as in Greek and
African legends) at Lake Titicaca, or reached its shores after wandering from the hole or cave
whence they first emerged. The myth, as adapted by the Incas, takes for granted the previous
existence of mankind, and, in some of its forms, the Inca period is preceded by the deluge.

Of the Peruvian myth concerning the origin of things, the following account is given by a Spanish
priest, Christoval de Moluna, in a report to the Bishop of Cuzco in 1570.(1) The story was
collected from the lips of ancient Peruvians and old native priests, who again drew their information
in part from the painted records reserved in the temple of the sun near Cuzco. The legend begins
with a deluge myth; a cataclysm ended a period of human existence. All mankind perished except
a man and woman, who floated in a box to a distance of several hundred miles from Cuzco. There
the creator commanded them to settle, and there, like Pund-jel in Australia, he made clay images
of men of all races, attired in their national dress, and then animated them. They were all
fashioned and painted as correct models, and were provided with their national songs and with
seed-corn. They then were put into the earth, and emerged all over the world at the proper
places, some (as in Africa and Greece) coming out of fountains, some out of trees, some out
of caves. For this reason they made huacas (worshipful objects or fetishes) of the trees, caves
and fountains. Some of the earliest men were changed into stones, others into falcons, condors
and other creatures which we know were totems in Peru. Probably this myth of metamorphosis
was invented to account for the reverence paid to totems or pacarissas as the Peruvians called
them. In Tiahuanaco, where the creation, or rather manufacture of men took place, the creator
turned many sinners into stones. The sun was made in the shape of a man, and, as he soared
into heaven, he called out in a friendly fashion to Manco Ccapac, the Ideal first Inca, "Look
upon me as thy father, and worship me as thy father". In these fables the creator is called
Pachyachachi, "Teacher of the world". According to Christoval, the creator and his sons were
"eternal and unchangeable". Among the Canaris men descend from the survivor of the deluge,
and a beautiful bird with the face of a woman, a siren in fact, but known better to ornithologists
as a macaw. "The chief cause," says the good Christoval, "of these fables was ignorance of God."

(1) Rites and Laws of the Yncas, p. 4, Hakluyt Society, 1873.

The story, as told by Cieza de Leon, runs thus:(1) A white man of great stature (in fact, "a
magnified non-natural man") came into the world, and gave life to beasts and human beings.
His name was Ticiviracocha, and he was called the Father of the Sun.(2) There are likenesses
of him in the temple, and he was regarded as a moral teacher. It was owing apparently to this
benevolent being that four mysterious brothers and sisters emerged from a cave--Children of
the Sun, fathers of the Incas, teachers of savage men. Their own conduct, however, was not
exemplary, and they shut up in a hole in the earth the brother of whom they were jealous. This
incident is even more common in the marchen or household tales than in the regular tribal or
national myths of the world.(3) The buried brother emerged again with wings, and "without doubt
he must have been some devil," says honest Cieza de Leon. This brother was Manco Ccapac, the
heroic ancestor of the Incas, and he turned his jealous brethren into stones. The whole tale
is in the spirit illustrated by the wilder romances of the Popol Vuh.

(1) Second Part of the Chronicles of Peru, p 5.

(2) See Making of Religion, pp. 265-270. Name and God are much disputed.

(3) The story of Joseph and the marchen of Jean de l'Ours are well-known examples.

Garcilasso gives three forms of this myth. According to "the old Inca," his maternal uncle,
it was the sun which sent down two of his children, giving them a golden staff, which would
sink into the ground at the place where they were to rest from wandering. It sank at Lake Titicaca.
About the current myths Garcilasso says generally that they were "more like dreams" than straightforward
stories; but, as he adds, the Greeks and Romans also "invented fables worthy to be laughed
at, and in greater number than the Indians. The stories of one age of heathenism may be compared
with those of the other, and in many points they will be found to agree." This critical position
of Garcilasso's will be proved correct when we reach the myths of Greeks and Indo-Aryans. The
myth as narrated north-east of Cuzco speaks of the four brothers and four sisters who came
out of caves, and the caves in Inca times were panelled with gold and silver.

Athwart all these lower myths, survivals from the savage stage, comes what Garcilasso regards
as the philosophical Inca belief in Pachacamac. This deity, to Garcilasso's mind, was purely
spiritual: he had no image and dwelt in no temple; in fact, he is that very God whom the Spanish
missionaries proclaimed. This view, though the fact has been doubted, was very probably held
by the Amautas, or philosophical class in Peru.(1) Cieza de Leon says "the name of this devil,
Pachacamac, means creator of the world". Garcilasso urges that Pachacamac was the animus mundi;
that he did not "make the world," as Pund-jel and other savage demiurges made it, but that
he was to the universe what the soul is to the body.

(1) Com. Real., vol. i. p. 106.

Here we find ourselves, if among myths at all, among the myths of metaphysics--rational myths;
that is, myths corresponding to our present stage of thought, and therefore intelligible to
us. Pachacamac "made the sun, and lightning, and thunder, and of these the sun was worshipped
by the Incas". Garcilasso denies that the moon was worshipped. The reflections of the sceptical
or monotheistic Inca, who declared that the sun, far from being a free agent, "seems like a
thing held to its task," are reported by Garcilasso, and appear to prove that solar worship
was giving way, in the minds of educated Peruvians, a hundred years before the arrival of Pizarro
and Valverde with his missal.(1)

(1) Garcilasso, viii. 8, quoting Blas Valera.

From this summary it appears that the higher Peruvian religion had wrested to its service,
and to the dynastic purposes of the Incas, a native myth of the familiar class, in which men
come ready made out of holes in the ground. But in Peru we do not find nearly such abundance
of other savage origin myths as will be proved to exist in the legends of Greeks and Indo-Aryans.
The reason probably is that Peru left no native literature; the missionaries disdained stories
of "devils," and Garcilasso's common sense and patriotism were alike revolted by the incidents
of stories "more like dreams" than truthful records. He therefore was silent about them. In
Greece and India, on the other hand, the native religious literature preserved myths of the
making of man out of clay, of his birth from trees and stones, of the fashioning of things
out of the fragments of mutilated gods and Titans, of the cosmic egg, of the rending and wounding
of a personal heaven and a personal earth, of the fishing up from the waters of a tiny earth
which grew greater, of the development of men out of beasts, with a dozen other such notions
as are familiar to contemporary Bushmen, Australians, Digger Indians, and Cahrocs. But in Greece
and India these ideas coexist with myths and religious beliefs as purely spiritual and metaphysical
as the belief in the Pachacamac of Garcilasso and the Amautas of Peru.

Before examining the myths of the Aryans of India, it is necessary to have a clear notion of
the nature of the evidence from which we derive our knowledge of the subject. That evidence
is found in a large and incongruous mass of literary documents, the heritage of the Indian
people. In this mass are extremely ancient texts (the Rig-Veda, and the Atharva-Veda), expository
comments of a date so much later that the original meaning of the older documents was sometimes
lost (the Brahmanas), and poems and legendary collections of a period later still, a period
when the whole character of religious thought had sensibly altered. In this literature there
is indeed a certain continuity; the names of several gods of the earliest time are preserved
in the legends of the latest. But the influences of many centuries of change, of contending
philosophies, of periods of national growth and advance, and of national decadence and decay,
have been at work on the mythology of India. Here we have myths that were perhaps originally
popular tales, and are probably old; here again, we have later legends that certainly were
conceived in the narrow minds of a pedantic and ceremonious priesthood. It is not possible,
of course, to analyse in this place all the myths of all the periods; we must be content to
point out some which seem to be typical examples of the working of the human intellect in its
earlier or its later childhood, in its distant hours of barbaric beginnings, or in the senility
of its sacerdotage.

The documents which contain Indian mythology may be divided, broadly speaking, into four classes.
First, and most ancient in date of composition, are the collections of hymns known as the Vedas.
Next, and (as far as date of collection goes) far less ancient, are the expository texts called
the Brahmanas. Later still, come other manuals of devotion and of sacred learning, called Sutras
and Upanishads; and last are the epic poems (Itihasas), and the books of legends called Puranas.
We are chiefly concerned here with the Vedas and Brahmanas. A gulf of time, a period of social
and literary change, separates the Brahmanas from the Vedas. But the epics and Puranas differ
perhaps even still more from the Brahmanas, on account of vast religious changes which brought
new gods into the Indian Olympus, or elevated to the highest place old gods formerly of low
degree. From the composition of the first Vedic hymn to the compilation of the latest Purana,
religious and mythopoeic fancy was never at rest.

Various motives induced various poets to assign, on various occasions the highest powers to
this or the other god. The most antique legends were probably omitted or softened by some early
Vedic bard (Rishi) of noble genius, or again impure myths were brought from the obscurity of
oral circulation and foisted into literature by some poet less divinely inspired. Old deities
were half-forgotten, and forgotten deities were resuscitated. Sages shook off superstitious
bonds, priests forged new fetters on ancient patterns for themselves and their flocks. Philosophy
explained away the more degrading myths; myths as degrading were suggested to dark and servile
hearts by unscientific etymologies. Over the whole mass of ancient mythology the new mythology
of a debased Brahmanic ritualism grew like some luxurious and baneful parasite. It is enough
for our purpose if we can show that even in the purest and most antique mythology of India
the element of traditional savagery survived and played its part, and that the irrational legends
of the Vedas and Brahmanas can often be explained as relics of savage philosophy or faith,
or as novelties planned on the ancient savage model, whether borrowed or native to the race.

The oldest documents of Indian mythology are the Vedas, usually reckoned as four in number.
The oldest, again, of the four, is the Sanhita ("collection") of the Rig-Veda. It is a purely
lyrical assortment of the songs "which the Hindus brought with them from their ancient homes
on the banks of the Indus". In the manuscripts, the hymns are classified according to the families
of poets to whom they are ascribed. Though composed on the banks of the Indus by sacred bards,
the hymns were compiled and arranged in India proper. At what date the oldest hymns of which
this collection is made up were first chanted it is impossible to say with even approximate
certainty. Opinions differ, or have differed, between 2400 B.C. and 1400 B.C. as the period
when the earliest sacred lyrics of the Veda may first have been listened by gods and men. In
addition to the Rig-Veda we have the Sanhita of the Sama-Veda, "an anthology taken from the
Rik-Samhita, comprising those of its verses which were intended to be chanted at the ceremonies
of the soma sacrifice".(1) It is conjectured that the hymns of the Sama-Veda were borrowed
from the Rig-Veda before the latter had been edited and stereotyped into its present form.
Next comes the Yajur-Veda, "which contains the formulas for the entire sacrificial ceremonial,
and indeed forms its proper foundations," the other Vedas being devoted to the soma sacrifice.(2)
The Yajur-Veda has two divisions, known as the Black and the White Yajur, which have common
matter, but differ in arrangement. The Black Yajur-Veda is also called the Taittirya, and it
is described as "a motley undigested jumble of different pieces".(3) Last comes Atharva-Veda,
not always regarded as a Veda properly speaking. It derives its name from an old semi-mythical
priestly family, the Atharvans, and is full of magical formulae, imprecations, folk-lore and
spells. There are good reasons for thinking this late as a collection, however early may be
the magical ideas expressed in its contents.(4)

(1) Weber, History of Indian Literature, Eng. transl., p. 63.

(2) Ibid., p. 86.

(3) Ibid, p. 87. The name Taittirya is derived from a partridge, or from a Rishi named Partridge
in Sanskrit. There is a story that the pupils of a sage were turned into partridges, to pick
up sacred texts.

(4) Barth (Les Religions de l'Inde, p. 6) thinks that the existence of such a collection as
the Atharva-Veda is implied, perhaps, in a text of the Rig-Veda, x. 90, 9.

Between the Vedas, or, at all events, between the oldest of the Vedas, and the compilation
of the Brahmanas, these "canonised explanations of a canonised text,"(1) it is probable that
some centuries and many social changes intervened.(2)

to judge from the utter inability of the authors of the Brahmanas to understand the antiquated
language of the hymns, these Brahmanas must be ascribed to a much later period than that which
gave birth to the hymns."

If we would criticise the documents for Indian mythology in a scientific manner, it is now
necessary that we should try to discover, as far as possible, the social and religious condition
of the people among whom the Vedas took shape. Were they in any sense "primitive," or were
they civilised? Was their religion in its obscure beginnings or was it already a special and
peculiar development, the fruit of many ages of thought? Now it is an unfortunate thing that
scholars have constantly, and as it were involuntarily, drifted into the error of regarding
the Vedas as if they were "primitive," as if they exhibited to us the "germs" and "genesis"
of religion and mythology, as if they contained the simple though strange utterances of PRIMITIVE
thought.(1) Thus Mr. Whitney declares, in his Oriental and Linguistic Studies, "that the Vedas
exhibit to us the very earliest germs of the Hindu culture". Mr. Max Muller avers that "no
country can be compared to India as offering opportunities for a real study of the genesis
and growth of religion".(2) Yet the same scholar observes that "even the earliest specimens
of Vedic poetry belong to the modern history of the race, and that the early period of the
historical growth of religion had passed away before the Rishis (bards) could have worshipped
their Devas or bright beings with sacred hymns and invocations". Though this is manifestly
true, the sacred hymns and invocations of the Rishis are constantly used as testimony bearing
on the beginning of the historical growth of religion. Nay, more; these remains of "the modern
history of the race" are supposed to exhibit mythology in the process of making, as if the
race had possessed no mythology before it reached a comparatively modern period, the Vedic
age. In the same spirit, Dr. Muir, the learned editor of Sanskrit Texts, speaks in one place
as if the Vedic hymns "illustrated the natural workings of the human mind in the period of
its infancy".(3) A brief examination of the social and political and religious condition of
man, as described by the poets of the Vedas, will prove that his infancy had long been left
behind him when the first Vedic hymns were chanted.

(2) Hibbert Lectures, p. 131.

(3) Nothing can prove more absolutely and more briefly the late character of Vedic faith than
the fact that the faith had already to be defended against the attacks of sceptics. The impious
denied the existence of Indra because he was invisible. Rig-Veda, ii. 12, 5; viii. 89, 3; v.
30, 1-2; vi. 27, 3. Bergaigne, ii. 167. "Es gibt keinen Indra, so hat der eine und der ander
gesagt" (Ludwig's version).

As Barth observes, the very ideas which permeate the Veda, the idea of the mystic efficacy
of sacrifice, of brahma, prove that the poems are profoundly sacerdotal; and this should have
given pause to the writers who have persisted in representing the hymns as the work of primitive
shepherds praising their gods as they feed their flocks.(1) In the Vedic age the ranks of society
are already at least as clearly defined as in Homeric Greece. "We men," says a poet of the
Rig-Veda,(2) "have all our different imaginations and designs. The carpenter seeks something
that is broken, the doctor a patient, the priest some one who will offer libations.... The
artisan continually seeks after a man with plenty of gold.... I am a poet, my father is a doctor,
and my mother is a grinder of corn." Chariots and the art of the chariot-builder are as frequently
spoken of as in the Iliad. Spears, swords, axes and coats of mail were in common use. The art
of boat-building or of ship-building was well known. Kine and horses, sheep and dogs, had long
been domesticated. The bow was a favourite weapon, and warriors fought in chariots, like the
Homeric Greeks and the Egyptians. Weaving was commonly practised. The people probably lived,
as a rule, in village settlements, but cities or fortified places were by no means unknown.(3)
As for political society, "kings are frequently mentioned in the hymns," and "it was regarded
as eminently beneficial for a king to entertain a family priest," on whom he was expected to
confer thousands of kine, lovely slaves and lumps of gold. In the family polygamy existed,
probably as the exception. There is reason to suppose that the brother-in-law was permitted,
if not expected, to "raise up seed" to his dead brother, as among the Hebrews.(4) As to literature,
the very structure of the hymns proves that it was elaborate and consciously artistic. M. Barth
writes: "It would be a great mistake to speak of the primitive naivete of the Vedic poetry
and religion".(5) Both the poetry and the religion, on the other hand, display in the highest
degree the mark of the sacerdotal spirit. The myths, though originally derived from nature-worship,
in an infinite majority of cases only reflect natural phenomena through a veil of ritualistic
corruptions.(6) The rigid division of castes is seldom recognised in the Rig-Veda. We seem
to see caste in the making.(7) The Rishis and priests of the princely families were on their
way to becoming the all-powerful Brahmans. The kings and princes were on their way to becoming
the caste of Kshatriyas or warriors. The mass of the people was soon to sink into the caste
of Vaisyas and broken men. Non-Aryan aborigines and others were possibly developing into the
caste of Sudras. Thus the spirit of division and of ceremonialism had still some of its conquests
to achieve. But the extraordinary attention given and the immense importance assigned to the
details of sacrifice, and the supernatural efficacy constantly attributed to a sort of magical
asceticism (tapas, austere fervour), prove that the worst and most foolish elements of later
Indian society and thought were in the Vedic age already in powerful existence.

by Dr. Arrowsmith, Boston, U.S., 1886) is probably the best short manual of the subject.

(7) On this subject see Muir, i. 192, with the remarks of Haug. "From all we know, the real
origin of caste seems to go back to a time anterior to the composition of the Vedic hymns,
though its development into a regular system with insurmountable barriers can be referred only
to the later period of the Vedic times." Roth approaches the subject from the word brahm, that
is, prayer with a mystical efficacy, as his starting-point. From brahm, prayer, came brahma,
he who pronounces the prayers and performs the rite. This celebrant developed into a priest,
whom to entertain brought blessings on kings. This domestic chaplaincy (conferring peculiar
and even supernatural benefits) became hereditary in families, and these, united by common
interests, exalted themselves into the Brahman caste. But in the Vedic age gifts of prayer
and poetry alone marked out the purohitas, or men put forward to mediate between gods and mortals.
Compare Ludwig, iii. 221.

Thus it is self-evident that the society in which the Vedic poets lived was so far from being
PRIMITIVE that it was even superior to the higher barbarisms (such as that of the Scythians
of Herodotus and Germans of Tacitus), and might be regarded as safely arrived at the threshold
of civilisation. Society possessed kings, though they may have been kings of small communities,
like those who warred with Joshua or fought under the walls of Thebes or Troy. Poets were better
paid than they seem to have been at the courts of Homer or are at the present time. For the
tribal festivals special priests were appointed, "who distinguished themselves by their comprehensive
knowledge of the requisite rites and by their learning, and amongst whom a sort of rivalry
is gradually developed, according as one tribe or another is supposed to have more or less
prospered by its sacrifices".(1) In the family marriage is sacred, and traces of polyandry
and of the levirate, surviving as late as the epic poems, were regarded as things that need
to be explained away. Perhaps the most barbaric feature in Vedic society, the most singular
relic of a distant past, is the survival, even in a modified and symbolic form, of human sacrifice.(2)

As to the religious condition of the Vedic Aryans, we must steadily remember that in the Vedas
we have the views of the Rishis only, that is, of sacred poets on their way to becoming a sacred
caste. Necessarily they no more represent the POPULAR creeds than the psalmists and prophets,
with their lofty monotheistic morality, represent the popular creeds of Israel. The faith of
the Rishis, as will be shown later, like that of the psalmists, has a noble moral aspect. Yet
certain elements of this higher creed are already found in the faiths of the lowest savages.
The Rishis probably did not actually INVENT them. Consciousness of sin, of imperfection in
the sight of divine beings, has been developed (as it has even in Australia) and is often confessed.
But on the whole the religion of the Rishis is practical--it might almost be said, is magical.
They desire temporal blessings, rain, sunshine, long life, power, wealth in flocks and herds.
The whole purpose of the sacrifices which occupy so much of their time and thought is to obtain
these good things. The sacrifice and the sacrificer come between gods and men. On the man's
side is faith, munificence, a compelling force of prayer and of intentness of will. The sacrifice
invigorates the gods to do the will of the sacrificer; it is supposed to be mystically celebrated
in heaven as well as on earth--the gods are always sacrificing. Often (as when rain is wanted)
the sacrifice imitates the end which it is desirable to gain.(1) In all these matters a minute
ritual is already observed. The mystic word brahma, in the sense of hymn or prayer of a compelling
and magical efficacy, has already come into use. The brahma answers almost to the Maori karakia
or incantation and charm. "This brahma of Visvamitra protects the tribe of Bharata." "Atri
with the fourth prayer discovered the sun concealed by unholy darkness."(2) The complicated
ritual, in which prayer and sacrifice were supposed to exert a constraining influence on the
supernatural powers, already existed, Haug thinks, in the time of the chief Rishis or hymnists
of the Rig-Veda.(3)

In many respects the nature of the idea of the divine, as entertained by the Rishis of the
Rig-Veda, is still matter for discussion. In the chapter on Vedic gods such particulars as
can be ascertained will be given. Roughly speaking, the religion is mainly, though not wholly,
a cult of departmental gods, originally, in certain cases, forces of Nature, but endowed with
moral earnestness. As to fetishism in the Vedas the opinions of the learned are divided. M.
Bergaigne(1) looks on the whole ritual as, practically, an organised fetishism, employed to
influence gods of a far higher and purer character. Mr. Max Muller remarks, "that stones, bones,
shells, herbs and all the other so-called fetishes, are simply absent in the old hymns, though
they appear in more modern hymns, particularly those of the Atharva-Veda. When artificial objects
are mentioned and celebrated in the Rig-Veda, they are only such as might be praised even by
Wordsworth or Tennyson--chariots, bows, quivers, axes, drums, sacrificial vessels and similar
objects. They never assume any individual character; they are simply mentioned as useful or
precious, it may be as sacred."(2)

(1) La Religion Vedique, vol. i. p. 123. "Le culte est assimilable dans une certaine mesure
aux incantations, aux pratiques magiques."

(2) Hibbert Lectures, p. 198.

When the existence of fetish "herbs" is denied by Mr. Max Muller, he does not, of course, forget
Soma, that divine juice. It is also to be noted that in modern India, as Mr. Max Muller himself
observes, Sir Alfred Lyall finds that "the husbandman prays to his plough and the fisher to
his net," these objects being, at present, fetishes. In opposition to Mr. Max Muller, Barth
avers that the same kind of fetishism which flourishes to-day flourishes in the Rig-Veda. "Mountains,
rivers, springs, trees, herbs are invoked as so many powers. The beasts which live with man--the
horse, the cow, the dog, the bird and the animals which imperil his existence--receive a cult
of praise and prayer. Among the instruments of ritual, some objects are more than things consecrated--they
are divinities; and the war-chariot, the weapons of defence and offence, the plough, are the
objects not only of benedictions but of prayers."(1) These absolute contradictions on matters
of fact add, of course, to the difficulty of understanding the early Indo-Aryan religion. One
authority says that the Vedic people were fetish-worshippers; another authority denies it.

(1) Barth, Les Religions de l'Inde, p. 7, with the Vedic texts.

Were the Rishis ancestor-worshippers? Barth has no doubt whatever that they were. In the pitris
or fathers he recognises ancestral spirits, now "companions of the gods, and gods themselves.
At their head appear the earliest celebrants of the sacrifice, Atharvan, the Angiras, the Kavis
(the pitris, par excellence) equals of the greatest gods, spirits who, BY DINT OF SACRIFICE,
drew forth the world from chaos, gave birth to the sun and lighted the stars,"--cosmical feats
which, as we have seen, are sometimes attributed by the lower races to their idealised mythic
ancestors, the "old, old ones" of Australians and Ovahereroes.

A few examples of invocations of the ancestral spirits may not be out of place.(1) "May the
Fathers protect me in my invocation of the gods." Here is a curious case, especially when we
remember how the wolf, in the North American myth, scattered the stars like spangles over the
sky: "The fathers have adorned the sky with stars".(2)

(1) Rig-Veda, vi. 52,4.

(2) Ibid., x. 68, xi.

Mr. Whitney (Oriental and Linguistic Studies, First Series, p. 59) gives examples of the ceremony
of feeding the Aryan ghosts. "The fathers are supposed to assemble, upon due invocation, about
the altar of him who would pay them homage, to seat themselves upon the straw or matting spread
for each of the guests invited, and to partake of the offerings set before them." The food
seems chiefly to consist of rice, sesame and honey.

Important as is the element of ancestor-worship in the evolution of religion, Mr. Max Muller,
in his Hibbert Lectures, merely remarks that thoughts and feelings about the dead "supplied
some of the earliest and most important elements of religion"; but how these earliest elements
affect his system does not appear. On a general view, then, the religion of the Vedic poets
contained a vast number of elements in solution--elements such as meet us in every quarter
of the globe. The belief in ancestral ghosts, the adoration of fetishes, the devotion to a
moral ideal, contemplated in the persons of various deities, some of whom at least have been,
and partly remain, personal natural forces, are all mingled, and all are drifting towards a
kind of pantheism, in which, while everything is divine, and gods are reckoned by millions,
the worshipper has glimpses of one single divine essence. The ritual, as we have seen, is more
or less magical in character. The general elements of the beliefs are found, in various proportions,
everywhere; the pantheistic mysticism is almost peculiar to India. It is, perhaps, needless
to repeat that a faith so very composite, and already so strongly differentiated, cannot possibly
be "primitive," and that the beliefs and practices of a race so highly organised in society
and so well equipped in material civilisation as the Vedic Aryans cannot possibly be "near
the beginning". Far from expecting to find in the Veda the primitive myths of the Aryans, we
must remember that myth had already, when these hymns were sung, become obnoxious to the religious
sentiment. "Thus," writes Barth, "the authors of the hymns have expurgated, or at least left
in the shade, a vast number of legends older than their time; such, for example, as the identity
of soma with the moon, as the account of the divine families, of the parricide of Indra, and
a long list might be made of the reticences of the Veda.... It would be difficult to extract
from the hymns a chapter on the loves of the gods. The goddesses are veiled, the adventures
of the gods are scarcely touched on in passing.... We must allow for the moral delicacy of
the singers, and for their dislike of speaking too precisely about the gods. Sometimes it seems
as if their chief object was to avoid plain speaking.... But often there is nothing save jargon
and indolence of mind in this voluntary obscurity, for already in the Veda the Indian intellect
is deeply smitten with its inveterate malady of affecting mystery the more, the more it has
nothing to conceal; the mania for scattering symbols which symbolise no reality, and for sporting
with riddles which it is not worth while to divine."(1) Barth, however, also recognises amidst
these confusions, "the inquietude of a heart deeply stirred, which seeks truth and redemption
in prayer". Such is the natural judgment of the clear French intellect on the wilfully obscure,
tormented and evasive intellect of India.

(1) Les Religions de l'Inde, p. 21.

It would be interesting were it possible to illuminate the criticism of Vedic religion by ascertaining
which hymns in the Rig-Veda are the most ancient, and which are later. Could we do this, we
might draw inferences as to the comparative antiquity of the religious ideas in the poems.
But no such discrimination of relative antiquity seems to be within the reach of critics. M.
Bergaigne thinks it impossible at present to determine the relative age of the hymns by any
philological test. The ideas expressed are not more easily arrayed in order of date. We might
think that the poems which contain most ceremonial allusions were the latest. But Mr. Max Muller
says that "even the earliest hymns have sentiments worthy of the most advanced ceremonialists".(1)

(1) History of Sanskrit Literature, p. 556.

The first and oldest source of our knowledge of Indo-Aryan myths is the Rig-Veda, whose nature
and character have been described. The second source is the Atharva-Veda with the Brahmanas.
The peculiarity of the Atharva is its collection of magical incantations spells and fragments
of folklore. These are often, doubtless, of the highest antiquity. Sorcery and the arts of
medicine-men are earlier in the course of evolution than priesthood. We meet them everywhere
among races who have not developed the institution of an order of priests serving national
gods. As a collection, the Atharva-Veda is later than the Rig-Veda, but we need not therefore
conclude that the IDEAS of the Atharva are "a later development of the more primitive ideas
of the Rig-Veda". Magic is quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus; the ideas of the Atharva-Veda
are everywhere; the peculiar notions of the Rig-Veda are the special property of an advanced
and highly differentiated people. Even in the present collected shape, M. Barth thinks that
many hymns of the Atharva are not much later than those of the Rig-Veda. Mr. Whitney, admitting
the lateness of the Atharva as a collection, says, "This would not necessarily imply that the
main body of the Atharva hymns were not already in existence when the compilation of the Rig-Veda
took place".(1) The Atharva refers to some poets of the Rig (as certain hymnists in the Rig
also do) as earlier men. If in the Rig (as Weber says) "there breathes a lively natural feeling,
a warm love of nature, while in the Atharva, on the contrary, there predominates an anxious
apprehension of evil spirits and their magical powers," it by no means follows that this apprehension
is of later origin than the lively feeling for Nature. Rather the reverse. There appears to
be no doubt(2) that the style and language of the Atharva are later than those of the Rig.
Roth, who recognises the change, in language and style, yet considers the Atharva "part of
the old literature".(3) He concludes that the Atharva contains many pieces which, "both by
their style and ideas, are shown to be contemporary with the older hymns of the Rig-Veda".
In religion, according to Muir,(4) the Atharva shows progress in the direction of monotheism
in its celebration of Brahman, but it also introduces serpent-worship.

(4) Ibid., ii. 451.

As to the Atharva, then, we are free to suppose, if we like, that the dark magic, the evil
spirits, the incantations, are old parts of Indian, as of all other popular beliefs, though
they come later into literature than the poetry about Ushas and the morality of Varuna. The
same remarks apply to our third source of information, the Brahmanas. These are indubitably
comments on the sacred texts very much more modern in form than the texts themselves. But it
does not follow, and this is most important for our purpose, that the myths in the Brahmanas
are all later than the Vedic myths or corruptions of the Veda. Muir remarks,(1) "The Rig-Veda,
though the oldest collection, does not necessarily contain everything that is of the greatest
age in Indian thought or tradition. We know, for example, that certain legends, bearing the
impress of the highest antiquity, such as that of the deluge, appear first in the Brahmanas."
We are especially interested in this criticism, because most of the myths which we profess
to explain as survivals of savagery are narrated in the Brahmanas. If these are necessarily
late corruptions of Vedic ideas, because the collection of the Brahmanas is far more modern
than that of the Veda, our argument is instantly disproved. But if ideas of an earlier stratum
of thought than the Vedic stratum may appear in a later collection, as ideas of an earlier
stratum of thought than the Homeric appear in poetry and prose far later than Homer, then our
contention is legitimate. It will be shown in effect that a number of myths of the Brahmanas
correspond in character and incident with the myths of savages, such as Cahrocs and Ahts. Our
explanation is, that these tales partly survived, in the minds perhaps of conservative local
priesthoods, from the savage stage of thought, or were borrowed from aborigines in that stage,
or were moulded in more recent times on surviving examples of that wild early fancy.

(1) Muir, iv. 450.

In the age of the Brahmanas the people have spread southwards from the basin of the Indus to
that of the Ganges. The old sacred texts have begun to be scarcely comprehensible. The priesthood
has become much more strictly defined and more rigorously constituted. Absurd as it may seem,
the Vedic metres, like the Gayatri, have been personified, and appear as active heroines of
stories presumably older than this personification. The Asuras have descended from the rank
of gods to that of the heavenly opposition to Indra's government; they are now a kind of fiends,
and the Brahmanas are occupied with long stories about the war in heaven, itself a very ancient
conception. Varuna becomes cruel on occasion, and hostile. Prajapati becomes the great mythical
hero, and inherits the wildest myths of the savage heroic beasts and birds.

The priests are now Brahmans, a hereditary divine caste, who possess all the vast and puerile
knowledge of ritual and sacrificial minutiae. As life in the opera is a series of songs, so
life in the Brahmanas is a sequence of sacrifices. Sacrifice makes the sun rise and set, and
the rivers run this way or that.

The study of Indian myth is obstructed, as has been shown, by the difficulty of determining
the relative dates of the various legends, but there are a myriad of other obstacles to the
study of Indian mythology. A poet of the Vedas says, "The chanters of hymns go about enveloped
in mist, and unsatisfied with idle talk".(1) The ancient hymns are still "enveloped in mist,"
owing to the difficulty of their language and the variety of modern renderings and interpretations.
The heretics of Vedic religion, the opponents of the orthodox commentators in ages comparatively
recent, used to complain that the Vedas were simply nonsense, and their authors "knaves and
buffoons". There are moments when the modern student of Vedic myths is inclined to echo this
petulant complaint. For example, it is difficult enough to find in the Rig-Veda anything like
a categoric account of the gods, and a description of their personal appearance. But in Rig-Veda,
viii. 29, 1, we read of one god, "a youth, brown, now hostile, now friendly; a golden lustre
invests him". Who is this youth? "Soma as the moon," according to the commentators. M. Langlois
thinks the sun is meant. Dr. Aufrecht thinks the troop of Maruts (spirits of the storm), to
whom, he remarks, the epithet "dark-brown, tawny" is as applicable as it is to their master,
Rudra. This is rather confusing, and a mythological inquirer would like to know for certain
whether he is reading about the sun or soma, the moon, or the winds.

(1) Rig-Veda, x. 82, 7, but compare Bergaigne, op. cit., iii. 72, "enveloppes de nuees et de
murmures".

To take another example; we open Mr. Max Muller's translation of the Rig-Veda at random, say
at page 49. In the second verse of the hymn to the Maruts, Mr. Muller translates, "They who
were born together, self-luminous, with the spotted deer (the clouds), the spears, the daggers,
the glittering ornaments. I hear their whips almost close by, as they crack them in their hands;
they gain splendour on their way." Now Wilson translates this passage, "Who, borne by spotted
deer, were born self-luminous, with weapons, war-cries and decorations. I hear the cracking
of their whips in their hands, wonderfully inspiring courage in the fight." Benfey has, "Who
with stags and spears, and with thunder and lightning, self-luminous, were born. Hard by rings
the crack of their whip as it sounds in their hands; bright fare they down in storm." Langlois
translates, "Just born are they, self-luminous. Mark ye their arms, their decorations, their
car drawn by deer? Hear ye their clamour? Listen! 'tis the noise of the whip they hold in their
hands, the sound that stirs up courage in the battle." This is an ordinary example of the diversities
of Vedic translation. It is sufficiently puzzling, nor is the matter made more transparent
by the variety of opinion as to the meaning of the "deer" along with which the Maruts are said
(by some of the translators) to have been born. This is just the sort of passage on which a
controversy affecting the whole nature of Vedic mythological ideas might be raised. According
to a text in the Yajur Veda, gods, and men, and beasts, and other matters were created from
various portions of the frame of a divine being named Prajapati.(1) The god Agni, Brahmans
and the goat were born from the mouth of Prajapati. From his breast and arms came the god Indra
(sometimes spoken of as a ram), the sheep, and of men the Rajanya. Cows and gods called Visvadevas
were born together from his middle. Are we to understand the words "they who were born together
with the spotted deer" to refer to a myth of this kind--a myth representing the Maruts and
deer as having been born at the same birth, as Agni came with the goat, and Indra with the
sheep? This is just the point on which the Indian commentators were divided.(2) Sayana, the
old commentator, says, "The legendary school takes them for deer with white spots; the etymological
school, for the many-coloured lines of clouds". The modern legendary (or anthropological) and
etymological (or philological) students of mythology are often as much at variance in their
attempts to interpret the traditions of India.

(1) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2nd edit., i. 16.

(2) Max Muller, Rig-Veda Sanhita, trans., vol. i. p. 59.

Another famous, and almost comic, example of the difficulty of Vedic interpretation is well
known. In Rig-Veda, x. 16, 4, there is a funeral hymn. Agni, the fire-god, is supplicated either
to roast a goat or to warm the soul of the dead and convey it to paradise. Whether the soul
is to be thus comforted or the goat is to be grilled, is a question that has mightily puzzled
Vedic doctors.(1) Professor Muller and M. Langlois are all for "the immortal soul", the goat
has advocates, or had advocates, in Aufrecht, Ludwig and Roth. More important difficulties
of interpretation are illustrated by the attitude of M. Bergaigne in La Religion Vedique, and
his controversy with the great German lexicographers. The study of mythology at one time made
the Vedas its starting-point. But perhaps it would be wise to begin from something more intelligible,
something less perplexed by difficulties of language and diversities of interpretation.

(1) Muir, v. 217.

In attempting to criticise the various Aryan myths, we shall be guided, on the whole, by the
character of the myths themselves. Pure and elevated conceptions we shall be inclined to assign
to a pure and elevated condition of thought (though such conceptions do, recognisably, occur
in the lowest known religious strata), and we shall make no difficulty about believing that
Rishis and singers capable of noble conceptions existed in an age very remote in time, in a
society which had many of the features of a lofty and simple civilisation. But we shall not,
therefore, assume that the hymns of these Rishis are in any sense "primitive," or throw much
light on the infancy of the human mind, or on the "origin" of religious and heroic myths. Impure,
childish and barbaric conceptions, on the other hand, we shall be inclined to attribute to
an impure, childish, and barbaric condition of thought; and we shall again make no difficulty
about believing that ideas originally conceived when that stage of thought was general have
been retained and handed down to a far later period. This view of the possible, or rather probable,
antiquity of many of the myths preserved in the Brahmanas is strengthened, if it needed strengthening,
by the opinion of Dr. Weber.(1) "We must indeed assume generally with regard to many of those
legends (in the Brahmanas of the Rig-Veda) that they had already gained a rounded independent
shape in tradition before they were incorporated into the Brahmanas; and of this we have frequent
evidence in the DISTINCTLY ARCHAIC CHARACTER OF THEIR LANGUAGE, compared with that of the rest
of the text."

(1) History of Indian Literature, English trans., p. 47.

We have now briefly stated the nature and probable relative antiquity of the evidence which
is at the disposal of Vedic mythologists. The chief lesson we would enforce is the necessity
of suspending the judgment when the Vedas are represented as examples of primitive and comparatively
pure and simple natural religion. They are not primitive; they are highly differentiated, highly
complex, extremely enigmatic expressions of fairly advanced and very peculiar religious thought.
They are not morally so very pure as has been maintained, and their purity, such as it is,
seems the result of conscious reticence and wary selection rather than of primeval innocence.
Yet the bards or editors have by no means wholly excluded very ancient myths of a thoroughly
savage character. These will be chiefly exposed in the chapter on "Indo-Aryan Myths of the
Beginnings of Things," which follows.

In discussing the savage myths of the origin of the world and of man, we observed that they
were as inconsistent as they were fanciful. Among the fancies embodied in the myths was noted
the theory that the world, or various parts of it, had been formed out of the body of some
huge non-natural being, a god, or giant, or a member of some ancient mysterious race. We also
noted the myths of the original union of heaven and earth, and their violent separation as
displayed in the tales of Greeks and Maoris, to which may be added the Acagchemem nation in
California.(1) Another feature of savage cosmogonies, illustrated especially in some early
Slavonic myths, in Australian legends, and in the faith of the American races, was the creation
of the world, or the recovery of a drowned world by animals, as the raven, the dove and the
coyote. The hatching of all things out of an egg was another rude conception, chiefly noted
among the Finns. The Indian form occurs in the Satapatha Brahmana.(2) The preservation of the
human race in the Deluge, or the creation of the race after the Deluge, was yet another detail
of savage mythology; and for many of these fancies we seemed to find a satisfactory origin
in the exceedingly credulous and confused state of savage philosophy and savage imagination.

The question now to be asked is, do the traditions of the Aryans of India supply us with myths
so closely resembling the myths of Nootkas, Maoris and Australians that we may provisionally
explain them as stories originally due to the invention of savages? This question may be answered
in the affirmative. The Vedas, the Epics and the Puranas contain a large store of various cosmogonic
traditions as inconsistent as the parallel myths of savages. We have an Aryan Ilmarinen, Tvashtri,
who, like the Finnish smith, forged "the iron vault of hollow heaven" and the ball of earth.(1)
Again, the earth is said to have sprung, as in some Mangaian fables, "from a being called Uttanapad".(2)
Again, Brahmanaspati, "blew the gods forth like a blacksmith," and the gods had a hand in the
making of things. In contrast with these childish pieces of anthropomorphism, we have the famous
and sublime speculations of an often-quoted hymn.(3) It is thus that the poet dreams of the
days before being and non-being began:--

(1) Muir, v. 354.

(2) Rig-Veda, x. 72, 4.

(3) Ibid., x. 126.

"There was then neither non-entity nor entity; there was no atmosphere nor sky above. What
enveloped (all)?... Was it water, the profound abyss? Death was not then, nor immortality:
there was no distinction of day or night. That One breathed calmly, self-supported; then was
nothing different from it, or above it. In the beginning darkness existed, enveloped in darkness.
All this was undistinguishable water. That One which lay void and wrapped in nothingness was
developed by the power of fervour. The ray (or cord) which stretched across these (worlds),
was it below or was it above? There were there impregnating powers and mighty forces, a self-supporting
principle beneath and energy aloft. Who knows? who here can declare whence has sprung, whence
this creation? The gods are subsequent to the development of this (universe); who then knows
whence it arose? From what this creation arose, and whether (any one) made it or not, he who
in the highest heaven is its ruler, he verily knows, or (even) he does not know."(1)

(1) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2nd edit., v. 357.

Here there is a Vedic hymn of the origin of things, from a book, it is true, supposed to be
late, which is almost, if not absolutely, free from mythological ideas. The "self-supporting
principle beneath and energy aloft" may refer, as Dr. Muir suggests, to the father, heaven
above, and the mother, earth beneath. The "bond between entity and non-entity" is sought in
a favourite idea of the Indian philosophers, that of tapas or "fervour". The other speculations
remind us, though they are much more restrained and temperate in character, of the metaphysical
chants of the New Zealand priests, of the Zunis, of Popol Vuh, and so on. These belong to very
early culture.

What is the relative age of this hymn? If it could be proved to be the oldest in the Veda,
it would demonstrate no more than this, that in time exceedingly remote the Aryans of India
possessed a philosopher, perhaps a school of philosophers, who applied the minds to abstract
speculations on the origin of things. It could not prove that mythological speculations had
not preceded the attempts of a purer philosophy. But the date cannot be ascertained. Mr. Max
Muller cannot go farther than the suggestion that the hymn is an expression of the perennis
quaedam philosophia of Leibnitz. We are also warned that a hymn is not necessarily modern because
it is philosophical.(1) Certainly that is true; the Zunis, Maoris, and Mangaians exhibit amazing
powers of abstract thought. We are not concerned to show that this hymn is late; but it seems
almost superfluous to remark that ideas like those which it contains can scarcely be accepted
as expressing man's earliest theory of the origin of all things. We turn from such ideas to
those which the Aryans of India have in common with black men and red men, with far-off Finns
and Scandinavians, Chaldaeans, Haidahs, Cherokees, Murri and Maori, Mangaians and Egyptians.

The next Vedic account of creation which we propose to consider is as remote as possible in
character from the sublime philosophic poem. In the Purusha Sukta, the ninetieth hymn of the
tenth book of the Rig-Veda Sanhita, we have a description of the creation of all things out
of the severed limbs of a magnified non-natural man, Purusha. This conception is of course
that which occurs in the Norse myths of the rent body of Ymir. Borr's sons took the body of
the Giant Ymir and of his flesh formed the earth, of his blood seas and waters, of his bones
mountains, of his teeth rocks and stones, of his hair all manner of plants, of his skull the
firmament, of his brains the clouds, and so forth. In Chaldean story, Bel cuts in twain the
magnified non-natural woman Omorca, and converts the halves of her body into heaven and earth.
Among the Iroquois in North America, Chokanipok was the giant whose limbs, bones and blood
furnished the raw material of many natural objects; while in Mangaia portions of Ru, in Egypt
of Set and Osiris, in Greece of Dionysus Zagreus were used in creating various things, such
as stones, plants and metals. The same ideas precisely are found in the ninetieth hymn of the
tenth book of the Rig-Veda. Yet it is a singular thing that, in all the discussions as to the
antiquity and significance of this hymn which have come under our notice, there has not been
one single reference made to parallel legends among Aryan or non-Aryan peoples. In accordance
with the general principles which guide us in this work, we are inclined to regard any ideas
which are at once rude in character and widely distributed, both among civilised and uncivilised
races, as extremely old, whatever may be the age of the literary form in which they are presented.
But the current of learned opinions as to the date of the Purusha Sukta, the Vedic hymn about
the sacrifice of Purusha and the creation of the world out of fragments of his body, runs in
the opposite direction. The hymn is not regarded as very ancient by most Sanskrit scholars.
We shall now quote the hymn, which contains the data on which any theory as to its age must
be founded:--(1)

(1) Rig-Veda, x. 90; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2nd edit., i. 9.

"Purusha has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. On every side enveloping the
earth, he overpassed (it) by a space of ten fingers. Purusha himself is this whole (universe),
whatever is and whatever shall be.... When the gods performed a sacrifice with Purusha as the
oblation, the spring was its butter, the summer its fuel, and the autumn its (accompanying)
offering. This victim, Purusha, born in the beginning, they immolated on the sacrificial grass.
With him the gods, the Sadhyas, and the Rishis sacrificed. From that universal sacrifice were
provided curds and butter. It formed those aerial (creatures) and animals both wild and tame.
From that universal sacrifice sprang the Ric and Saman verses, the metres and Yajush. From
it sprang horses, and all animals with two rows of teeth; kine sprang from it; from it goats
and sheep. When (the gods) divided Purusha, into how many parts did they cut him up? What was
his mouth? What arms (had he)? What (two objects) are said (to have been) his thighs and feet?
The Brahman was his mouth; the Rajanya was made his arms; the being (called) the Vaisya, he
was his thighs; the Sudra sprang from his feet. The moon sprang from his soul (Mahas), the
sun from his eye, Indra and Agni from his mouth, and Yaiyu from his breath. From his navel
arose the air, from his head the sky, from his feet the earth, from his ear the (four) quarters;
in this manner (the gods) formed the world. When the gods, performing sacrifice, bound Purusha
as a victim, there were seven sticks (stuck up) for it (around the fire), and thrice seven
pieces of fuel were made. With sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice. These were the earliest
rites. These great powers have sought the sky, where are the former Sadhyas, gods."

The myth here stated is plain enough in its essential facts. The gods performed a sacrifice
with a gigantic anthropomorphic being (Purusha = Man) as the victim. Sacrifice is not found,
as a rule, in the religious of the most backward races of all; it is, relatively, an innovation,
as shall be shown later. His head, like the head of Ymir, formed the sky, his eye the sun,
animals sprang from his body. The four castes are connected with, and it appears to be implied
that they sprang from, his mouth, arms, thighs and feet. It is obvious that this last part
of the myth is subsequent to the formation of castes. This is one of the chief arguments for
the late date of the hymn, as castes are not distinctly recognised elsewhere in the Rig-Veda.
Mr. Max Muller(1) believes the hymn to be "modern both in its character and in its diction,"
and this opinion he supports by philological arguments. Dr. Muir(2) says that the hymn "has
every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas". Dr Haug, on the other hand,(3)
in a paper read in 1871, admits that the present form of the hymn is not older than the greater
part of the hymns of the tenth book, and than those of the Atharva Veda; but he adds, "The
ideas which the hymn contains are certainly of a primeval antiquity.... In fact, the hymn is
found in the Yajur-Veda among the formulas connected with human sacrifices, which were formerly
practised in India." We have expressly declined to speak about "primeval antiquity," as we
have scarcely any evidence as to the myths and mental condition for example, even of palaeolithic
man; but we may so far agree with Dr. Haug as to affirm that the fundamental idea of the Purusha
Sukta, namely, the creation of the world or portions of the world out of the fragments of a
fabulous anthropomorphic being is common to Chaldeans, Iroquois, Egyptians, Greeks, Tinnehs,
Mangaians and Aryan Indians. This is presumptive proof of the antiquity of the ideas which
Dr. Muir and Mr. Max Muller think relatively modern. The savage and brutal character of the
invention needs no demonstration. Among very low savages, for example, the Tinnehs of British
North America, not a man, not a god, but a DOG, is torn up, and the fragments are made into
animals.(4) On the Paloure River a beaver suffers in the manner of Purusha. We may, for these
reasons, regard the chief idea of the myth as extremely ancient--infinitely more ancient than
the diction of the hymn.

As to the mention of the castes, supposed to be a comparatively modern institution, that is
not an essential part of the legend. When the idea of creation out of a living being was once
received it was easy to extend the conception to any institution, of which the origin was forgotten.
The Teutonic race had a myth which explained the origin of the classes eorl, ceorl and thrall
(earl, churl and slave). A South American people, to explain the different ranks in society,
hit on the very myth of Plato, the legend of golden, silver and copper races, from which the
ranks of society have descended. The Vedic poet, in our opinion, merely extended to the institution
of caste a myth which had already explained the origin of the sun, the firmament, animals,
and so forth, on the usual lines of savage thought. The Purusha Sukta is the type of many other
Indian myths of creation, of which the following(1) one is extremely noteworthy. "Prajapati
desired to propagate. He formed the Trivrit (stoma) from his mouth. After it were produced
the deity Agni, the metre Gayatri,... of men the Brahman, of beasts the goat;... from his breast,
and from his arms he formed the Panchadasa (stoma). After it were created the God Indra, the
Trishtubh metre,... of men the Rajanya, of beasts the sheep. Hence they are vigorous, because
they were created from vigour. From his middle he formed the Saptadasa (stoma). After it were
created the gods called the Yisvadevas, the Jagati metre,... of men the Vaisya, of beasts kine.
Hence they are to be eaten, because they were created from the receptacle of food." The form
in which we receive this myth is obviously later than the institution of caste and the technical
names for metres. Yet surely any statement that kine "are to be eaten" must be older than the
universal prohibition to eat that sacred animal the cow. Possibly we might argue that when
this theory of creation was first promulgated, goats and sheep were forbidden food.(2)

(1) Taittirya Sanhita, or Yajur-Veda, vii. i. 1-4; Muir, 2nd edit., i. 15.

(2) Mr. M'Lennan has drawn some singular inferences from this passage, connecting, as it does,
certain gods and certain classes of men with certain animals, in a manner somewhat suggestive
of totemism (Fornightly Review), February, 1870.

Turning from the Vedas to the Brahmanas, we find a curiously savage myth of the origin of species.(1)
According to this passage of the Brahmana, "this universe was formerly soul only, in the form
of Purusha". He caused himself to fall asunder into two parts. Thence arose a husband and a
wife. "He cohabited with her; from them men were born. She reflected, 'How does he, after having
produced me from himself, cohabit with me? Ah, let me disappear.' She became a cow, and the
other a bull, and he cohabited with her. From them kine were produced." After a series of similar
metamorphoses of the female into all animal shapes, and a similar series of pursuits by the
male in appropriate form, "in this manner pairs of all sorts of creatures down to ants were
created". This myth is a parallel to the various Greek legends about the amours in bestial
form of Zeus, Nemesis, Cronus, Demeter and other gods and goddesses. In the Brahmanas this
myth is an explanation of the origin of species, and such an explanation as could scarcely
have occurred to a civilised mind. In other myths in the Brahmanas, Prajapati creates men from
his body, or rather the fluid of his body becomes a tortoise, the tortoise becomes a man (purusha),
with similar examples of speculation.(2)

(1) Satapatha Brahmana, xiv. 4, 2; Muir, 2nd edit., i. 25.

(2) Similar tales are found among the Khonds.

Among all these Brahmana myths of the part taken by Prajapati in the creation or evoking of
things, the question arises who WAS Prajapati? His role is that of the great Hare in American
myth; he is a kind of demiurge, and his name means "The Master of Things Created," like the
Australian Biamban, "Master," and the American title of the chief Manitou, "Master of Life",(1)
Dr. Muir remarks that, as the Vedic mind advances from mere divine beings who "reside and operate
in fire" (Agni), "dwell and shine in the sun" (Surya), or "in the atmosphere" (Indra), towards
a conception of deity, "the farther step would be taken of speaking of the deity under such
new names as Visvakarman and Prajapati". These are "appellatives which do not designate any
limited functions connected with any single department of Nature, but the more general and
abstract notions of divine power operating in the production and government of the universe".
Now the interesting point is that round this new and abstract NAME gravitate the most savage
and crudest myths, exactly the myths we meet among Hottentots and Nootkas. For example, among
the Hottentots it is Heitsi Eibib, among the Huarochiri Indians it is Uiracocha, who confers,
by curse or blessing, on the animals their proper attributes and characteristics.(2) In the
Satapatha Brahmana it is Prajapati who takes this part, that falls to rude culture-heroes of
Hottentots and Huarochiris.(3) How Prajapati made experiments in a kind of state-aided evolution,
so to speak, or evolution superintended and assisted from above, will presently be set forth.

In the Puranas creation is a process renewed after each kalpa, or vast mundane period. Brahma
awakes from his slumber, and finds the world a waste of water. Then, just as in the American
myths of the coyote, and the Slavonic myths of the devil and the doves, a boar or a fish or
a tortoise fishes up the world out of the waters. That boar, fish, tortoise, or what not, is
Brahma or Vishnu. This savage conception of the beginnings of creation in the act of a tortoise,
fish, or boar is not first found in the Puranas, as Mr. Muir points out, but is indicated in
the Black Yajur Veda and in the Satapatha Brahmana.(1) In the Satapatha Brahmana, xiv. 1, 2,
11, we discover the idea, so common in savage myths--for example, in that of the Navajoes--that
the earth was at first very small, a mere patch, and grew bigger after the animal fished it
up. "Formerly this earth was only so large, of the size of a span. A boar called Emusha raised
her up." Here the boar makes no pretence of being the incarnation of a god, but is a mere boar
sans phrase, like the creative coyote of the Papogas and Chinooks, or the musk-rat of the Tacullies.
This is a good example of the development of myths. Savages begin, as we saw, by mythically
regarding various animals, spiders, grasshoppers, ravens, eagles, cockatoos, as the creators
or recoverers of the world. As civilisation advances, those animals still perform their beneficent
functions, but are looked on as gods in disguise. In time the animals are often dropped altogether,
though they hold their place with great tenacity in the cosmogonic traditions of the Aryans
in India. When we find the Satapatha Brahmana alleging(2) "that all creatures are descended
from a tortoise," we seem to be among the rude Indians of the Pacific Coast. But when the tortoise
is identified with Aditya, and when Adityas prove to be solar deities, sons of Aditi, and when
Aditi is recognised by Mr. Muller as the Dawn, we see that the Aryan mind has not been idle,
but has added a good deal to the savage idea of the descent of men and beasts from a tortoise.(3)

"Mexican and Australian Hurricane World's End," Bancroft, v. 64.

Another feature of savage myths of creation we found to be the introduction of a crude theory
of evolution. We saw that among the Potoyante tribe of the Digger Indians, and among certain
Australian tribes, men and beasts were supposed to have been slowly evolved and improved out
of the forms first of reptiles and then of quadrupeds. In the mythologies of the more civilised
South American races, the idea of the survival of the fittest was otherwise expressed. The
gods made several attempts at creation, and each set of created beings proving in one way or
other unsuited to its environment, was permitted to die out or degenerated into apes, and was
succeeded by a set better adapted for survival.(1) In much the same way the Satapatha Brahmana(2)
represents mammals as the last result of a series of creative experiments. "Prajapati created
living beings, which perished for want of food. Birds and serpents perished thus. Prajapati
reflected, 'How is it that my creatures perish after having been formed?' He perceived this:
'They perish from want of food'. In his own presence he caused milk to be supplied to breasts.
He created living beings, which, resorting to the breasts, were thus preserved. These are the
creatures which did not perish."

(1) This myth is found in Popol Vuh. A Chinook myth of the same sort, Bancroft, v. 95.

(2) ii. 5, 11; Muir, 2nd edit., i. 70.

The common myth which derives the world from a great egg--the myth perhaps most familiar in
its Finnish shape--is found in the Satapatha Brahmana.(1) "In the beginning this universe was
waters, nothing but waters. The waters desired: 'How can we be reproduced?' So saying, they
toiled, they performed austerity. While they were performing austerity, a golden egg came into
existence. It then became a year.... From it in a year a man came into existence, who was Prajapati....
He conceived progeny in himself; with his mouth he created the gods." According to another
text,(2) "Prajapati took the form of a tortoise". The tortoise is the same as Aditya.(3)

(1) xi. 1, 6, 1; Muir, Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, 1863.

(2) Satapatha Brahmana, vii. 4, 3, 5.

(3) Aitareya Brahmana, iii. 34 (11, 219), a very discreditable origin of species.

It is now time to examine the Aryan shape of the widely spread myth about the marriage of heaven
and earth, and the fortunes of their children. We have already seen that in New Zealand heaven
and earth were regarded as real persons, of bodily parts and passions, united in a secular
embrace. We shall apply the same explanation to the Greek myth of Gaea and of the mutilation
of Cronus. In India, Dyaus (heaven) answers to the Greek Uranus and the Maori Rangi, while
Prithivi (earth) is the Greek Gaea, the Maori Papa. In the Veda, heaven and earth are constantly
styled "parents";(1) but this we might regard as a mere metaphorical expression, still common
in poetry. A passage of the Aitareya Brahmana, however, retains the old conception, in which
there was nothing metaphorical at all.(2) These two worlds, heaven and earth, were once joined.
Subsequently they were separated (according to one account, by Indra, who thus plays the part
of Cronus and of Tane Mahuta). "Heaven and earth," says Dr. Muir, "are regarded as the parents
not only of men, but of the gods also, as appears from the various texts where they are designated
by the epithet Devapatre, 'having gods for their children'." By men in an early stage of thought
this myth was accepted along with others in which heaven and earth were regarded as objects
created by one of their own children, as by Indra,(3) who "stretched them out like a hide,"
who, like Atlas, "sustains and upholds them"(4) or, again, Tvashtri, the divine smith, wrought
them by his craft; or, once more, heaven and earth sprung from the head and feet of Purusha.
In short, if any one wished to give an example of that recklessness of orthodoxy or consistency
which is the mark of early myth, he could find no better example than the Indian legends of
the origin of things. Perhaps there is not one of the myths current among the lower races which
has not its counterpart in the Indian Brahmanas. It has been enough for us to give a selection
of examples.

The Greeks, when we first make their acquaintance in the Homeric poems, were a cultivated people,
dwelling, under the government of royal families, in small city states. This social condition
they must have attained by 1000 B.C., and probably much earlier. They had already a long settled
past behind them, and had no recollection of any national migration from the "cradle of the
Aryan race". On the other hand, many tribes thought themselves earth-born from the soil of
the place where they were settled. The Maori traditions prove that memories of a national migration
may persist for several hundred years among men ignorant of writing. Greek legend, among a
far more civilised race, only spoke of occasional foreign settlers from Sidon, Lydia, or Egypt.
The Homeric Greeks were well acquainted with almost all the arts of life, though it is not
absolutely certain that they could write, and certainly they were not addicted to reading.
In war they fought from chariots, like the Egyptians and Assyrians; they were bold seafarers,
being accustomed to harry the shores even of Egypt, and they had large commercial dealings
with the people of Tyre and Sidon. In the matter of religion they were comparatively free and
unrestrained. Their deities, though, in myth, capricious in character, might be regarded in
many ways as "making for righteousness". They protected the stranger and the suppliant; they
sanctioned the oath, they frowned on the use of poisoned arrows; marriage and domestic life
were guarded by their good-will; they dispensed good and evil fortune, to be accepted with
humility and resignation among mortals.

The patriarchal head of each family performed the sacrifices for his household, the king for
the state, the ruler of Mycenae, Agamemnon, for the whole Achaean host encamped before the
walls of Troy. At the same time, prophets, like Calchas, possessed considerable influence,
due partly to an hereditary gift of second-sight, as in the case of Theoclymenus,(1) partly
to acquired professional skill in observing omens, partly to the direct inspiration of the
gods. The oracle at Delphi, or, as it is called by Homer, Pytho, was already famous, and religion
recognised, in various degrees, all the gods familiar to the later cult of Hellas. In a people
so advanced, so much in contact with foreign races and foreign ideas, and so wonderfully gifted
by nature with keen intellect and perfect taste, it is natural to expect, if anywhere, a mythology
almost free from repulsive elements, and almost purged of all that we regard as survivals from
the condition of savagery. But while Greek mythology is richer far than any other in beautiful
legend, and is thronged with lovely and majestic forms of gods and goddesses, nymphs and oreads
ideally fair, none the less a very large proportion of its legends is practically on a level
with the myths of Maoris, Thlinkeets, Cahrocs and Bushmen.

(1) Odyssey, xx. 354.

This is the part of Greek mythology which has at all times excited most curiosity, and has
been made the subject of many systems of interpretation. The Greeks themselves, from almost
the earliest historical ages, were deeply concerned either to veil or explain away the blasphemous
horrors of their own "sacred chapters," poetic traditions and temple legends. We endeavour
to account for these as relics of an age of barbarism lying very far behind the time of Homer--an
age when the ancestors of the Greeks either borrowed, or more probably developed for themselves,
the kind of myths by which savage peoples endeavour to explain the nature and origin of the
world and all phenomena.

The correctness of this explanation, resting as it does on the belief that the Greeks were
at one time in the savage status, might be demonstrated from the fact that not only myths,
but Greek life in general, and especially Greek ritual, teemed with surviving examples of institutions
and of manners which are found everywhere among the most backward and barbarous races. It is
not as if only the myths of Greece retained this rudeness, or as if the Greeks supposed themselves
to have been always civilised. The whole of Greek life yields relics of savagery when the surface
is excavated ever so slightly. Moreover, that the Greeks, as soon as they came to reflect on
these matters at all, believed themselves to have emerged from a condition of savagery is undeniable.
The poets are entirely at one on this subject with Moschion, a writer of the school of Euripides.
"The time hath been, yea, it HATH been," he says, "when men lived like the beasts, dwelling
in mountain caves, and clefts unvisited of the sun.... Then they broke not the soil with ploughs
nor by aid of iron, but the weaker man was slain to make the supper of the stronger," and so
on.(1) This view of the savage origin of mankind was also held by Aristotle:(2) "It is probable
that the first men, whether they were produced by the earth (earth-born) or survived from some
deluge, were on a level of ignorance and darkness".(3) This opinion, consciously held and stated
by philosophers and poets, reveals itself also in the universal popular Greek traditions that
men were originally ignorant of fire, agriculture, metallurgy and all the other arts and conveniences
of life, till they were instructed by ideal culture-heroes, like Prometheus, members of a race
divine or half divine. A still more curious Athenian tradition (preserved by Varro) maintained,
not only that marriage was originally unknown, but that, as among Australians and some Red
Indians, the family name, descended through the mother, and kinship was reckoned on the female
side before the time of Cecrops.(4)

While Greek opinion, both popular and philosophical, admitted, or rather asserted, that savagery
lay in the background of the historical prospect, Greek institutions retained a thousand birth-marks
of savagery. It is manifest and undeniable that the Greek criminal law, as far as it effected
murder, sprang directly from the old savage blood-feud.(1) The Athenian law was a civilised
modification of the savage rule that the kindred of a slain man take up his blood-feud. Where
homicide was committed WITHIN the circle of blood relationship, as by Orestes, Greek religion
provided the Erinnyes to punish an offence which had, as it were, no human avenger. The precautions
taken by murderers to lay the ghost of the slain man were much like those in favour among the
Australians. The Greek cut off the extremities of his victim, the tips of the hands and feet,
and disposed them neatly beneath the arm-pits of the slain man.(2) In the same spirit, and
for the same purpose, the Australian black cuts off the thumbs of his dead enemy, that the
ghost too may be mutilated and prevented from throwing at him with a ghostly spear. We learn
also from Apollonius Rhodius and his scholiast that Greek murderers used thrice to suck in
and spit out the gore of their victims, perhaps with some idea of thereby partaking of their
blood, and so, by becoming members of their kin, putting it beyond the power of the ghosts
to avenge themselves. Similar ideas inspire the worldwide savage custom of making an artificial
"blood brotherhood" by mingling the blood of the contracting parties. As to the ceremonies
of cleansing from blood-guiltiness among the Greeks, we may conjecture that these too had their
primitive side; for Orestes, in the Eumenides, maintains that he has been purified of his mother's
slaughter by sufficient blood of swine. But this point will be illustrated presently, when
we touch on the mysteries.

Ritual and myth, as might be expected, retained vast masses of savage rites and superstitious
habits and customs. To be "in all things too superstitious," too full of deisidaimonia, was
even in St. Paul's time the characteristic of the Athenians. Now superstition, or deisidaimonia,
is defined by Theophrastus,(1) as "cowardice in regard to the supernatural" ((Greek text omitted)).
This "cowardice" has in all ages and countries secured the permanence of ritual and religious
traditions. Men have always argued, like one of the persons in M. Renan's play, Le Pretre de
Nemi, that "l'ordre du monde depend de l'ordre des rites qu'on observe". The familiar endurable
sequence of the seasons of spring, and seed-sowing, and harvest depend upon the due performance
of immemorial religious acts. "In the mystic deposits," says Dinarchus, "lies the safety of
the city."(2) What the "mystic deposits" were nobody knows for certain, but they must have
been of very archaic sanctity, and occur among the Arunta and the Pawnees.

Ritual is preserved because it preserves LUCK. Not only among the Romans and the Brahmans,
with their endless minute ritual actions, but among such lower races as the Kanekas of New
Caledonia, the efficacy of religious functions is destroyed by the slightest accidental infraction
of established rules.(1) The same timid conservatism presides over myth, and in each locality
the mystery-plays, with their accompanying narratives, preserved inviolate the early forms
of legend. Myth and ritual do not admit of being argued about. "C'etait le rite etabli. Ce
n'etait pas plus absurde qu'autre chose," says the conservative in M. Renan's piece, defending
the mode of appointment of

     The priest who slew the slayer,
     And shall himself be slain.

(1) Thus the watchers of the dead in New Caledonia are fed by the sorcerer with a mess at the
end of a very long spoon, and should the food miss the mouth, all the ceremonies have to be
repeated. This detail is from Mr. J. J. Atkinson.

Now, if the rites and myths preserved by the timorousness of this same "cowardice towards the
supernatural" were originally evolved in the stage of savagery, savage they would remain, as
it is impious and dangerous to reform them till the religion which they serve perishes with
them. These relics in Greek ritual and faith are very commonly explained as due to Oriental
influences, as things borrowed from the dark and bloody superstitions of Asia. But this attempt
to save the native Greek character for "blitheness" and humanity must not be pushed too far.(1)
It must be remembered that the cruder and wilder sacrifices and legends of Greece were strictly
LOCAL; that they were attached to these ancient temples, old altars, barbarous xoana, or wooden
idols, and rough fetish stones, in which Pausanias found the most ancient relics of Hellenic
theology. This is a proof of their antiquity and a presumption in favour of their freedom from
foreign influence. Most of these things were survivals from that dimly remembered prehistoric
age in which the Greeks, not yet gathered into city states, lived in villages or kraals, or
pueblos, as we should translate (Greek text omitted), if we were speaking of African or American
tribes. In that stage the early Greeks must have lacked both the civic and the national or
Panhellenic sentiment; their political unit was the clan, which, again, answered in part to
the totem kindred of America, or Africa, or Australia.(2) In this stagnant condition they could
not have made acquaintance with the many creeds of Semitic and other alien peoples on the shores
of the Levant.(3) It was later, when Greece had developed the city life of the heroic age,
that her adventurous sons came into close contact with Egypt and Phoenicia.

(2) As C. O. Muller judiciously remarks: "The scenes of nine-tenths of the Greek myths are
laid in PARTICULAR DISTRICTS OF GREECE, and they speak of the primeval inhabitants, of the
lineage and adventures of native heroes. They manifest an accurate acquaintance with individual
localities, which, at a time when Greece was neither explored by antiquaries, nor did geographical
handbooks exist, could be possessed only by the inhabitants of these localities." Muller gives,
as examples, myths of bears more or less divine. Scientific Mythology, pp. 14, 15.

In the colonising time, still later--perhaps from 900 B.C. downwards--the Greeks, settled on
sites whence they had expelled Sidonians or Sicanians, very naturally continued, with modifications,
the worship of such gods as they found already in possession. Like the Romans, the Greeks easily
recognised their own deities in the analogous members of foreign polytheistic systems. Thus
we can allow for alien elements in such gods and goddesses as Zeus Asterios, as Aphrodite of
Cyprus or Eryx, or the many-breasted Ephesian Artemis, whose monstrous form had its exact analogue
among the Aztecs in that many-breasted goddess of the maguey plant whence beer was made. To
discern and disengage the borrowed factors in the Hellenic Olympus by analysis of divine names
is a task to which comparative philology may lawfully devote herself; but we cannot so readily
explain by presumed borrowing from without the rude xoana of the ancient local temples, the
wild myths of the local legends, the sacra which were the exclusive property of old-world families,
Butadae or Eumolpidae. These are clearly survivals from a stage of Greek culture earlier than
the city state, earlier than the heroic age of the roving Greek Vikings, and far earlier than
the Greek colonies. They belong to that conservative and immobile period when the tribe or
clan, settled in its scattered kraals, lived a life of agriculture, hunting and cattle-breeding,
engaged in no larger or more adventurous wars than border feuds about women or cattle. Such
wars were on a humbler scale than even Nestor's old fights with the Epeians; such adventures
did not bring the tribe into contact with alien religions. If Sidonian merchantmen chanced
to establish a factory near a tribe in this condition, their religion was not likely to make
many proselytes.

These reasons for believing that most of the wilder element in Greek ritual and myth was native
may be briefly recapitulated, as they are often overlooked. The more strange and savage features
meet us in LOCAL tales and practices, often in remote upland temples and chapels. There they
had survived from the society of the VILLAGE status, before villages were gathered into CITIES,
before Greeks had taken to a roving life, or made much acquaintance with distant and maritime
peoples.

For these historical reasons, it may be assumed that the LOCAL religious antiquities of Greece,
especially in upland districts like Arcadia and Elis, are as old, and as purely national, as
free from foreign influences as any Greek institutions can be. In these rites and myths of
true folk-lore and Volksleben, developed before Hellas won its way to the pure Hellenic stage,
before Egypt and Phoenicia were familiar, should be found that common rude element which Greeks
share with the other races of the world, and which was, to some extent, purged away by the
genius of Homer and Pindar, pii vates et Phaebo digna locuti.

In proof of this local conservatism, some passages collected by K. F. Hermann in his Lehrbuch
der Griechischen Antiquitaten(1) may be cited. Thus Isocrates writes,(2) "This was all their
care, neither to destroy any of the ancestral rites, nor to add aught beyond what was ordained".
Clemens Alexandrinus reports that certain Thessalians worshipped storks, "IN ACCORDANCE WITH
USE AND WONT".(3) Plato lays down the very "law of least change" which has been described.
In this very passage Plato(4) speaks of rites "derived from Tyrrhenia or Cyprus" as falling
within the later period of the Greek Wanderjahre. On the high religious value of things antique,
Porphyry wrote in a late age, and when the new religion of Christ was victorious, "Comparing
the new sacred images with the old, we see that the old are more simply fashioned, yet are
held divine, but the new, admired for their elaborate execution, have less persuasion of divinity,"--a
remark anticipated by Pausanias, "The statues Daedalus wrought are quainter to the outward
view, yet there shows forth in them somewhat supernatural".(5) So Athenaeus(6) reports of a
visitor to the shrine of Leto in Delos, that he expected the ancient statue of the mother of
Apollo to be something remarkable, but, unlike the pious Porphyry, burst out laughing when
he found it a shapeless wooden idol. These idols were dressed out, fed and adorned as if they
had life.(7) It is natural that myths dating from an age when Greek gods resembled Polynesian
idols should be as rude as Polynesian myths. The tenacity of LOCAL myth is demonstrated by
Pausanias, who declares that even in the highly civilised Attica the Demes retained legends
different from those of the central city--the legends, probably, which were current before
the villages were "Synoecised" into Athens.(8)

It appears, then, that Greek ritual necessarily preserves matter of the highest antiquity,
and that the oldest rites and myths will probably be found, not in the Panhellenic temples,
like that in Olympia, not in the NATIONAL poets, like Homer and Sophocles, but in the LOCAL
fanes of early tribal gods, and in the LOCAL mysteries, and the myths which came late, if they
came at all, into literary circulation. This opinion is strengthened and illustrated by that
invaluable guide-book of the artistic and religious pilgrim written in the second century after
our era by Pausanias. If we follow him, we shall find that many of the ceremonies, stories
and idols which he regarded as oldest are analogous to the idols and myths of the contemporary
backward races. Let us then, for the sake of illustrating the local and savage survivals in
Greek religion, accompany Pausanias in his tour through Hellas.

In Christian countries, especially in modern times, the contents of one church are very like
the furniture of another church; the functions in one resemble those in all, though on the
Continent some shrines still retain relics and customs of the period when local saints had
their peculiar rites. But it was a very different thing in Greece. The pilgrim who arrived
at a temple never could guess what oddity or horror in the way of statues, sacrifices, or stories
might be prepared for his edification. In the first place, there were HUMAN SACRIFICES. These
are not familiar to low savages, if known to them at all. Probably they were first offered
to barbaric royal ghosts, and thence transferred to gods. In the town of Salamis, in Cyprus,
about the date of Hadrian, the devout might have found the priest slaying a human victim to
Zeus,--an interesting custom, instituted, according to Lactantius, by Teucer, and continued
till the age of the Roman Empire.(1)

(1) Euseb., Praep. Ev., iv. 17, mentions, among peoples practising human sacrifices, Rhodes,
Salamis, Heliopolis, Chios, Tenedos, Lacedaemon, Arcadia and Athens; and, among gods thus honoured,
Hera, Athene, Cronus, Ares, Dionysus, Zeus and Apollo. For Dionysus the Cannibal, Plutarch,
Themist., 13; Porphyr., Abst., ii. 55. For the sacrifice to Zeus Laphystius, see Grote, i.
c. vi., and his array of authorities, especially Herodotus, vii. 197. Clemens Alexandrinus
(i. 36) mentions the Messenians, to Zeus; the Taurians, to Artemis, the folk of Pella, to Peleus
and Chiron; the Cretans, to Zeus; the Lesbians, to Dionysus. Geusius de Victimis Humanis (1699)
may be consulted.

At Alos in Achaia Phthiotis, the stranger MIGHT have seen an extraordinary spectacle, though
we admit that the odds would have been highly against his chance of witnessing the following
events. As the stranger approaches the town-hall, he observes an elderly and most respectable
citizen strolling in the same direction. The citizen is so lost in thought that apparently
he does not notice where he is going. Behind him comes a crowd of excited but silent people,
who watch him with intense interest. The citizen reaches the steps of the town-hall, while
the excitement of his friends behind increases visibly. Without thinking, the elderly person
enters the building. With a wild and un-Aryan howl, the other people of Alos are down on him,
pinion him, wreathe him with flowery garlands, and, lead him to the temple of Zeus Laphystius,
or "The Glutton," where he is solemnly sacrificed on the altar. This was the custom of the
good Greeks of Alos whenever a descendant of the house of Athamas entered the Prytaneion. Of
course the family were very careful, as a rule, to keep at a safe distance from the forbidden
place. "What a sacrifice for Greeks!" as the author of the Minos(1) says in that dialogue which
is incorrectly attributed to Plato. "He cannot get out except to be sacrificed," says Herodotus,
speaking of the unlucky descendant of Athamas. The custom appears to have existed as late as
the time of the scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius.(2)

Even in the second century, when Pausanias visited Arcadia, he found what seem to have been
human sacrifices to Zeus. The passage is so very strange and romantic that we quote a part
of it.(1) "The Lycaean hill hath other marvels to show, and chiefly this: thereon there is
a grove of Zeus Lycaeus, wherein may men in nowise enter; but if any transgresses the law and
goes within, he must die within the space of one year. This tale, moreover, they tell, namely,
that whatsoever man or beast cometh within the grove casts no shadow, and the hunter pursues
not the deer into that wood, but, waiting till the beast comes forth again, sees that it has
left its shadow behind. And on the highest crest of the whole mountain there is a mound of
heaped-up earth, the altar of Zeus Lycaeus, and the more part of Peloponnesus can be seen from
that place. And before the altar stand two pillars facing the rising sun, and thereon golden
eagles of yet more ancient workmanship. And on this altar they sacrifice to Zeus in a manner
that may not be spoken, and little liking had I to make much search into this matter. BUT LET
IT BE AS IT IS, AND AS IT HATH BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING." The words "as it hath been from the
beginning" are ominous and significant, for the traditional myths of Arcadia tell of the human
sacrifices of Lycaon, and of men who, tasting the meat of a mixed sacrifice, put human flesh
between their lips unawares.(2) This aspect of Greek religion, then, is almost on a level with
the mysterious cannibal horrors of "Voodoo," as practised by the secret societies of negroes
in Hayti. But concerning these things, as Pausanias might say, it is little pleasure to inquire.

(1) Pausanias, viii. 2.

(2) Plato, Rep., viii. 565, d. This rite occurs in some African coronation ceremonies.

Even where men were not sacrificed to the gods, the tourist among the temples would learn that
these bloody rites had once been customary, and ceremonies existed by way of commutation. This
is precisely what we find in Vedic religion, in which the empty form of sacrificing a man was
gone through, and the origin of the world was traced to the fragments of a god sacrificed by
gods.(1) In Sparta was an altar of Artemis Orthia, and a wooden image of great rudeness and
antiquity--so rude indeed, that Pausanias, though accustomed to Greek fetish-stones, thought
it must be of barbaric origin. The story was that certain people of different towns, when sacrificing
at the altar, were seized with frenzy and slew each other. The oracle commanded that the altar
should be sprinkled with human blood. Men were therefore chosen by lot to be sacrificed till
Lycurgus commuted the offering, and sprinkled the altar with the blood of boys who were flogged
before the goddess. The priestess holds the statue of the goddess during the flogging, and
if any of the boys are but lightly scourged, the image becomes too heavy for her to bear.

(1) The Purusha Sukhta, in Rig-Veda, x. 90.

The Ionians near Anthea had a temple of Artemis Triclaria, and to her it had been customary
to sacrifice yearly a youth and maiden of transcendent beauty. In Pausanias's time the human
sacrifice was commuted. He himself beheld the strange spectacle of living beasts and birds
being driven into the fire to Artemis Laphria, a Calydonian goddess, and he had seen bears
rush back among the ministrants; but there was no record that any one had ever been hurt by
these wild beasts.(1) The bear was a beast closely connected with Artemis, and there is some
reason to suppose that the goddess had herself been a she-bear or succeeded to the cult of
a she-bear in the morning of time.(2)

(1) Paus., vii. 18, 19.

(2) See "Artemis", postea.

It may be believed that where symbolic human sacrifices are offered, that is, where some other
victim is slain or a dummy of a man is destroyed, and where legend maintains that the sacrifice
was once human, there men and women were originally the victims. Greek ritual and Greek myth
were full of such tales and such commutations.(1) In Rome, as is well known, effigies of men
called Argives were sacrificed.(2) As an example of a beast-victim given in commutation, Pausanias
mentions(3) the case of the folk of Potniae, who were compelled once a year to offer to Dionysus
a boy, in the bloom of youth. But the sacrifice was commuted for a goat.

(1) See Hermann, Alterthumer., ii. 159-161, for abundant examples.

(2) Plutarch, Quest. Rom. 32.

(3) ix. 8, 1.

These commutations are familiar all over the world. Even in Mexico, where human sacrifices
and ritual cannibalism were daily events, Quetzalcoatl was credited with commuting human sacrifices
for blood drawn from the bodies of the religious. In this one matter even the most conservative
creeds and the faiths most opposed to change sometimes say with Tartuffe:--

     Le ciel defend, de vrai, certains contentements,
     Mais on trouve avec lui des accommodements.

Though the fact has been denied (doubtless without reflection), the fact remains that the Greeks
offered human sacrifices. Now what does this imply? Must it be taken as a survival from barbarism,
as one of the proofs that the Greeks had passed through the barbaric status?

The answer is less obvious than might be supposed. Sacrifice has two origins. First, there
are HONORIFIC sacrifices, in which the ghost or god (or divine beast, if a divine beast be
worshipped) is offered the food he is believed to prefer. This does not occur among the lowest
savages. To carnivorous totems, Garcilasso says, the Indians of Peru offered themselves. The
feeding of sacred mice in the temples of Apollo Smintheus is well known. Secondly, there are
expiatory or PIACULAR sacrifices, in which the worshipper, as it were, fines himself in a child,
an ox, or something else that he treasures. The latter kind of sacrifice (most common in cases
of crime done or suspected within the circle of kindred) is not necessarily barbaric, except
in its cruelty. An example is the Attic Thargelia, in which two human scape-goats annually
bore "the sins of the congregation," and were flogged, driven to the sea with figs tied round
their necks, and burned.(1)

(1) Compare the Marseilles human sacrifice, Petron., 141; and for the Thargelia, Tsetzes, Chiliads,
v. 736; Hellad. in Photius, p. 1590 f. and Harpoc. s. v.

The institution of human sacrifice, then, whether the offering be regarded as food, or as a
gift to the god of what is dearest to man (as in the case of Jephtha's daughter), or whether
the victim be supposed to carry on his head the sins of the people, does not necessarily date
from the period of savagery. Indeed, sacrifice flourishes most, not among savages, but among
advancing barbarians. It would probably be impossible to find any examples of human sacrifices
of an expiatory or piacular character, any sacrifices at all, among Australians, or Andamanese,
or Fuegians. The notion of presenting food to the supernatural powers, whether ghosts or gods,
is relatively rare among savages.(1) The terrible Aztec banquets of which the gods were partakers
are the most noted examples of human sacrifices with a purely cannibal origin. Now there is
good reason to guess that human sacrifices with no other origin than cannibalism survived even
in ancient Greece. "It may be conjectured," writes Professor Robertson Smith,(2) "that the
human sacrifices offered to the Wolf Zeus (Lycaeus) in Arcadia were originally cannibal feasts
of a Wolf tribe. The first participants in the rite were, according to later legend, changed
into wolves; and in later times(3) at least one fragment of the human flesh was placed among
the sacrificial portions derived from other victims, and the man who ate it was believed to
become a were-wolf."(4) It is the almost universal rule with cannibals not to eat members of
their own stock, just as they do not eat their own totem. Thus, as Professor Robertson Smith
says, when the human victim is a captive or other foreigner, the human sacrifice may be regarded
as a survival of cannibalism. Where, on the other hand, the victim is a fellow tribesman, the
sacrifice is expiatory or piacular.

Among Greek cannibal gods we cannot fail to reckon the so-called "Cannibal Dionysus," and probably
the Zeus of Orchomenos, Zeus Laphystius, who is explained by Suidas as "the Glutton Zeus".
The cognate verb ((Greek text omitted)) means "to eat with mangling and rending," "to devour
gluttonously". By Zeus Laphystius, then, men's flesh was gorged in this distressing fashion.

The evidence of human sacrifice (especially when it seems not piacular, but a relic of cannibalism)
raises a presumption that Greeks had once been barbarians. The presumption is confirmed by
the evidence of early Greek religious art.

When his curiosity about human sacrifices was satisfied, the pilgrim in Greece might turn his
attention to the statues and other representations of the gods. He would find that the modern
statues by famous artists were beautiful anthropomorphic works in marble or in gold and ivory.
It is true that the faces of the ancient gilded Dionysi at Corinth were smudged all over with
cinnabar, like fetish-stones in India or Africa.(1) As a rule, however, the statues of historic
times were beautiful representations of kindly and gracious beings. The older works were stiff
and rigid images, with the lips screwed into an unmeaning smile. Older yet were the bronze
gods, made before the art of soldering was invented, and formed of beaten plates joined by
small nails. Still more ancient were the wooden images, which probably bore but a slight resemblance
to the human frame, and which were often mere "stocks".(2) Perhaps once a year were shown the
very early gods, the Demeter with the horse's head, the Artemis with the fish's tails, the
cuckoo Hera, whose image was of pear-wood, the Zeus with three eyes, the Hermes, made after
the fashion of the pictures on the walls of sacred caves among the Bushmen. But the oldest
gods of all, says Pausanias repeatedly, were rude stones in the temple or the temple precinct.
In Achaean Pharae he found some thirty squared stones, named each after a god. "Among all the
Greeks in the oldest times rude stones were worshipped in place of statues." The superstitious
man in Theophrastus's Characters used to anoint the sacred stones with oil. The stone which
Cronus swallowed in mistake for Zeus was honoured at Delphi, and kept warm with wool wrappings.
There was another sacred stone among the Troezenians, and the Megarians worshipped as Apollo
a stone cut roughly into a pyramidal form. The Argives had a big stone called Zeus Kappotas.
The Thespians worshipped a stone which they called Eros; "their oldest idol is a rude stone".(3)
It is well known that the original fetish-stone has been found in situ below the feet of the
statue of Apollo in Delos. On this showing, then, the religion of very early Greeks in Greece
was not unlike that of modern Negroes. The artistic evolution of the gods, a remarkably rapid
one after a certain point, could be traced in every temple. It began with the rude stone, and
rose to the wooden idol, in which, as we have seen, Pausanias and Porphyry found such sanctity.
Next it reached the hammered bronze image, passed through the archaic marbles, and culminated
in the finer marbles and the chryselephantine statues of Zeus and Athena. But none of the ancient
sacred objects lost their sacredness. The oldest were always the holiest idols; the oldest
of all were stumps and stones, like savage fetish-stones.

(2) Clemens Alex., Protrept. (Oxford, 1715). p. 41.

(3) Gill, Myths of South Pacific, p. 60. Compare a god, which proved to be merely pumice-stone,
and was regarded as the god of winds and waves, having been drifted to Puka-Puka. Offerings
of food were made to it during hurricanes.

Another argument in favour of the general thesis that savagery left deep marks on Greek life
in general, and on myth in particular, may be derived from survivals of totemism in ritual
and legend. The following instances need not necessarily be accepted, but it may be admitted
that they are precisely the traces which totemism would leave had it once existed, and then
waned away on the advance of civilisation.(1)

(1) The argument to be derived from the character of the Greek (Greek text omitted) as a modified
form of the totem-kindred is too long and complex to be put forward here. It is stated in Custom
and Myth, "The history of the Family," in M'Lennan's Studies in Early history, and is assumed,
if not proved, in Ancient Society by the late Mr. Lewis Morgan.

That Greeks in certain districts regarded with religious reverence certain plants and animals
is beyond dispute. That some stocks even traced their lineage to beasts will be shown in the
chapter on Greek Divine Myths, and the presumption is that these creatures, though explained
as incarnations and disguises of various gods, were once totems sans phrase, as will be inferred
from various examples. Clemens Alexandrinus, again, after describing the animal-worship of
the Egyptians, mentions cases of zoolatry in Greece.(1) The Thessalians revered storks, the
Thebans weasels, and the myth ran that the weasel had in some way aided Alcmena when in labour
with Heracles. In another form of the myth the weasel was the foster-mother of the hero.(2)
Other Thessalians, the Myrmidons, claimed descent from the ant and revered ants. The religious
respect paid to mice in the temple of Apollo Smintheus, in the Troad, Rhodes, Gela, Lesbos
and Crete is well known, and a local tribe were alluded to as Mice by an oracle. The god himself,
like the Japanese harvest-god, was represented in art with a mouse at his foot, and mice, as
has been said, were fed at his shrine.(3) The Syrians, says Clemens Alexandrinus, worship doves
and fishes, as the Elians worship Zeus.(4) The people of Delphi adored the wolf,(5) and the
Samians the sheep. The Athenians had a hero whom they worshipped in the shape of a wolf.(6)
A remarkable testimony is that of the scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, ii. 124. "The wolf,"
he says, "was a beast held in honour by the Athenians, and whosoever slays a wolf collects
what is needful for its burial." The burial of sacred animals in Egypt is familiar. An Arab
tribe mourns over and solemnly buries all dead gazelles.(7) Nay, flies were adored with the
sacrifice of an ox near the temple of Apollo in Leucas.(8) Pausanias (iii. 22) mentions certain
colonists who were guided by a hare to a site where the animal hid in a myrtle-bush. They therefore
adore the myrtle, (Greek text omitted). In the same way a Carian stock, the Ioxidae, revered
the asparagus.(9) A remarkable example of descent mythically claimed from one of the lower
animals is noted by Otfried Muller.(10) Speaking of the swan of Apollo, he says, "That deity
was worshipped, according to the testimony of the Iliad, in the Trojan island of Tenedos. There,
too, was Tennes honoured as the (Greek text omitted) of the island. Now his father was called
Cycnus (the swan) in an oft-told and romantic legend.(11)... The swan, therefore, as father
to the chief hero on the Apolline island, stands in distinct relation to the god, who is made
to come forward still more prominently from the fact that Apollo himself is also called father
of Tennes. I think we can scarcely fail to recognise a mythus which was local at Tenedos....
The fact, too, of calling the swan, instead of Apollo, the father of a hero, demands altogether
a simplicity and boldness of fancy which are far more ancient than the poems of Homer."

Had Muller known that this "simplicity and boldness of fancy" exist to-day, for example, among
the Swan tribe of Australia, he would probably have recognised in Cycnus a survival from totemism.
The fancy survives again in Virgil's Cupavo, "with swan's plumes rising from his crest, the
mark of his father's form".(1) Descent was claimed, not only from a swan Apollo, but from a
dog Apollo.

(1) Aeneid, x. 187.

In connection with the same set of ideas, it is pointed out that several (Greek text omitted),
or stocks, had eponymous heroes, in whose names the names of the ancestral beast apparently
survived. In Attica the Crioeis have their hero (Crio, "Ram"), the Butadae have Butas ("Bullman"),
the Aegidae have Aegeus ("Goat"), and the Cynadae, Cynus ("Dog"). Lycus, according to Harpocration
(s. v.) has his statue in the shape of a wolf in the Lyceum. "The general facts that certain
animals might not be sacrificed to certain gods" (at Athens the Aegidae introduced Athena,
to whom no goat might be offered on the Acropolis, while she herself wore the goat skin, aegis),
"while, on the other hand, each deity demanded particular victims, explained by the ancients
themselves in certain cases to be hostile animals, find their natural explanation" in totemism.(1)
Mr. Evelyn Abbott points out, however, that the names Aegeus, Aegae, Aegina, and others, may
be connected with the goat only by an old volks-etymologie, as on coins of Aegina in Achaea.
The real meaning of the words may be different. Compare (Greek text omitted), the sea-shore.
Mr. J. G. Frazer does not, at present, regard totemism as proved in the case of Greece.(2)

(1) Some apparent survivals of totemism in ritual will be found in the chapter on Greek gods,
especially Zeus, Dionysus, and Apollo.

(2) See his Golden Bough, an alternative explanation of these animals in connection with "The
Corn Spirit".

As final examples of survivals from the age of barbarism in the religion of Greece, certain
features in the Mysteries may be noted. Plutarch speaks of "the eating of raw flesh, and tearing
to pieces of victims, as also fastings and beatings of the breast, and again in many places
abusive language at the sacrifices, and other mad doings". The mysteries of Demeter, as will
appear when her legend is criticised, contained one element all unlike these "mad doings";
and the evidence of Sophocles, Pindar, Plutarch and others demonstrate that religious consolations
were somehow conveyed in the Eleusinia. But Greece had many other local mysteries, and in several
of these it is undeniable the Greeks acted much as contemporary Australians, Zunis and Negroes
act in their secret initiations which, however, also inculcate moral ideas of considerable
excellence. Important as these analogies are, they appear to have escaped the notice of most
mythologists. M. Alfred Maury, however, in Les Religions de la Grece, published in 1857, offers
several instances of hidden rites, common to Hellas and to barbarism.

There seem in the mysteries of savage races to be two chief purposes. There is the intention
of giving to the initiated a certain sacred character, which puts them in close relation with
gods or demons, and there is the introduction of the young to complete or advancing manhood,
and to full participation in the savage Church with its ethical ideas. The latter ceremonies
correspond, in short, to confirmation, and they are usually of a severe character, being meant
to test by fasting (as Plutarch says) and by torture (as in the familiar Spartan rite) the
courage and constancy of the young braves. The Greek mysteries best known to us are the Thesmophoria
and the Eleusinia. In the former the rites (as will appear later) partook of the nature of
savage "medicine" or magic, and were mainly intended to secure fertility in husbandry and in
the family. In the Eleusinia the purpose was the purification of the initiated, secured by
ablutions and by standing on the "ram's-skin of Zeus," and after purifications the mystae engaged
in sacred dances, and were permitted to view a miracle play representing the sorrows and consolations
of Demeter. There was a higher element, necessarily obscure in nature. The chief features in
the whole were purifications, dancing, sacrifice and the representation of the miracle play.
It would be tedious to offer an exhaustive account of savage rites analogous to these mysteries
of Hellas. Let it suffice to display the points where Greek found itself in harmony with Australian,
and American, and African practice. These points are: (1) mystic dances; (2) the use of a little
instrument, called turndun in Australia, whereby a roaring noise is made, and the profane are
warned off; (3) the habit of daubing persons about to be initiated with clay or anything else
that is sordid, and of washing this off; apparently by way of showing that old guilt is removed
and a new life entered upon; (4) the performances with serpents may be noticed, while the "mad
doings" and "howlings" mentioned by Plutarch are familiar to every reader of travels in uncivilised
countries; (5) ethical instruction is communicated. ((Greek text omitted)). The text is a valuable
instance of survival in religion. When they were converted to Christianity the Peruvians detected
the analogy between our sacrament and their mysteries, and they kept up as much as possible
of the old rite in the new ritual. Just as the mystae of Eleusis practised chastity, abstaining
from certain food, and above all from beans, before the great Pagan sacrament, so did the Indians.
"To prepare themselves all the people fasted two days, during which they did neyther company
with their wives, nor eate any meate with salt or garlicke, nor drink any chic.... And although
the Indians now forbeare to sacrifice beasts or other things publikely, which cannot be hidden
from the Spaniardes, yet doe they still use many ceremonies that have their beginnings from
these feasts and auntient superstitions, for at this day do they covertly make their feast
of Ytu at the daunces of the feast of the Sacrament. Another feast falleth almost at the same
time, whereas the Christians observe the solempnitie of the holy Sacrament, which DOTH RESEMBLE
IT IN SOME SORT, AS IN DAUNCING, SINGING AND REPRESENTATIONS."(4) The holy "daunces" at Seville
are under Papal disapproval, but are to be kept up, it is said, till the peculiar dresses used
in them are worn out. Acosta's Indians also had "garments which served only for this feast".
It is superfluous to multiply examples of the dancing, which is an invariable feature of savage
as of Greek mysteries.

2. The Greek and savage use of the turndun, or bribbun of Australia in the mysteries is familiar
to students. This fish-shaped flat board of wood is tied to a string, and whirled round, so
as to cause a peculiar muffled roar. Lobeck quotes from the old scholia on Clemens Alexandrinus,
published by Bastius in annotations on St. Gregory, the following Greek description of the
turndun, the "bull-roarer" of English country lads, the Gaelic srannam:(1) (Greek text omitted)".
"The conus was a little slab of wood, tied to a string, and whirled round in the mysteries
to make a whirring noise. As the mystic uses of the turndun in Australia, New Zealand, New
Mexico and Zululand have elsewhere been described at some length (Custom and Myth, pp. 28-44),
it may be enough to refer the reader to the passage. Mr. Taylor has since found the instrument
used in religious mysteries in West Africa, so it has now been tracked almost round the world.
That an instrument so rude should be employed by Greek and Australians on mystic occasions
is in itself a remarkable coincidence. Unfortunately, Lobeck, who published the Greek description
of the turndun (Aglaophamus, 700), was unacquainted with the modern ethnological evidence.

at St. Mary's Loch.

3. The custom of plastering the initiated over with clay or filth was common in Greek as in
barbaric mysteries. Greek examples may be given first. Demosthenes accuses Aeschines of helping
his mother in certain mystic rites, aiding her, especially, by bedaubing the initiate with
clay and bran.(1) Harpocration explains the term used ((Greek text omitted)) thus: "Daubing
the clay and bran on the initiate, to explain which they say that the Titans when they attacked
Dionysus daubed themselves over with chalk, but afterwards, for ritual purposes, clay was used".
It may be urged with some force that the mother of Aeschines introduced foreign, novel and
possibly savage rites. But Sophocles, in a fragment of his lost play, the Captives, uses the
term in the same ritual sense--

    (Greek text omitted).

(1) De Corona, 313.

The idea clearly was that by cleansing away the filth plastered over the body was symbolised
the pure and free condition of the initiate. He might now cry in the mystic chant--

     (Greek text omitted).
     Worse have I fled, better have I found.

That this was the significance of the daubing with clay in Greek mysteries and the subsequent
cleansing seems quite certain. We are led straight to this conclusion by similar rites, in
which the purpose of mystically cleansing was openly put forward. Thus Plutarch, in his essay
on superstition, represents the guilty man who would be purified actually rolling in clay,
confessing his misdeeds, and then sitting at home purified by the cleansing process ((Greek
text omitted)).(1) In another rite, the cleansing of blood-guiltiness, a similar process was
practised. Orestes, after killing his mother, complains that the Eumenides do not cease to
persecute him, though he has been "purified by blood of swine".(2) Apollonius says that the
red hand of the murderer was dipped in the blood of swine and then washed.(3) Athenaeus describes
a similar unpleasant ceremony.(4) The blood of whelps was apparently used also, men being first
daubed with it and then washed clean.(5) The word (Greek text omitted) is again the appropriate
ritual term. Such rites Plutarch calls (Greek text omitted), "filthy purifications".(6) If
daubing with dirt is known to have been a feature of Greek mysteries, it meets us everywhere
among savages. In O-Kee-Pa, that curiously minute account of the Mandan mysteries, Catlin writes
that a portion of the frame of the initiate was "covered with clay, which the operator took
from a wooden bowl, and with his hand plastered unsparingly over". The fifty young men waiting
for initiation "were naked and entirely covered with clay of various colours".(7) The custom
is mentioned by Captain John Smith in Virginia. Mr. Winwood Reade found it in Africa, where,
as among the Mandans and Spartans, cruel torture and flogging accompanied the initiation of
young men.(8) In Australia the evidence for daubing the initiate is very abundant.(9) In New
Mexico, the Zunis stole Mr. Cushing's black paint, as considering it even better than clay
for religious daubing.(10)

4. Another savage rite, the use of serpents in Greek mysteries, is attested by Clemens Alexandrinus
and by Demosthenes (loc. cit.). Clemens says the snakes were caressed in representations of
the loves of Zeus in serpentine form. The great savage example is that of "the snake-dance
of the Moquis," who handle rattle-snakes in the mysteries without being harmed.(1) The dance
is partly totemistic, partly meant, like the Thesmophoria, to secure the fertility of the lands
of the Moquis of Arizonas. The turndum or (Greek text omitted) is employed. Masks are worn,
as in the rites of Demeter Cidiria in Arcadia.(2)

5. This last point of contact between certain Greek and certain savage mysteries is highly
important. The argument of Lobeck, in his celebrated work Aglaophamus, is that the Mysteries
were of no great moment in religion. Had he known the evidence as to savage initiations, he
would have been confirmed in his opinion, for many of the singular Greek rites are clearly
survivals from savagery. But was there no more truly religious survival? Pindar is a very ancient
witness that things of divine import were revealed. "Happy is he who having seen these things
goes under the hollow earth. He knows the end of life, and the god-given beginning."(1) Sophocles
"chimes in," as Lobeck says, declaring that the initiate alone LIVE in Hades, while other souls
endure all evils. Crinagoras avers that even in life the initiate live secure, and in death
are the happier. Isagoras declares that about the end of life and all eternity they have sweet
hopes.

(1) Fragm., cxvi., 128 H. p. 265.

Splendida testimonia, cries Lobeck. He tries to minimise the evidence, remarking that Isocrates
promises the very same rewards to all who live justly and righteously. But why not, if to live
justly and righteously was part of the teaching of the mysteries of Eleusis? Cicero's evidence,
almost a translation of the Greek passages already cited, Lobeck dismisses as purely rhetorical.(1)
Lobeck's method is rather cavalier. Pindar and Sophocles meant something of great significance.

(1) De Legibus ii. 14; Aglaophamus, pp. 69-74.

Now we have acknowledged savage survivals of ugly rites in the Greek mysteries. But it is only
fair to remember that, in certain of the few savage mysteries of which we know the secret,
righteousness of life and a knowledge of good are inculcated. This is the case in Australia,
and in Central Africa, where to be "uninitiated" is equivalent to being selfish.(1) Thus it
seems not improbable that consolatory doctrines were expounded in the Eleusinia, and that this
kind of sermon or exhortation was no less a survival from savagery than the daubing with clay,
and the (Greek text omitted), and other wild rites.

(1) Making of Religion, pp. 193-197, 235.

We have now attempted to establish that in Greek law and ritual many savage customs and usages
did undeniably survive. We have seen that both philosophical and popular opinion in Greece
believed in a past age of savagery. In law, in religion, in religious art, in custom, in human
sacrifice, in relics of totemism, and in the mysteries, we have seen that the Greeks retained
plenty of the usages now found among the remotest and most backward races. We have urged against
the suggestion of borrowing from Egypt or Asia that these survivals are constantly found in
local and tribal religion and rituals, and that consequently they probably date from that remote
prehistoric past when the Greeks lived in village settlements. It may still doubtless be urged
that all these things are Pelasgic, and were the customs of a race settled in Hellas before
the arrival of the Homeric Achaeans, and Dorians, and Argives, who, on this hypothesis, adopted
and kept up the old savage Pelasgian ways and superstitions. It is impossible to prove or disprove
this belief, nor does it affect our argument. We allege that all Greek life below the surface
was rich in institutions now found among the most barbaric peoples. These institutions, whether
borrowed or inherited, would still be part of the legacy left by savages to cultivated peoples.
As this legacy is so large in custom and ritual, it is not unfair to argue that portions of
it will also be found in myths. It is now time to discuss Greek myths of the origin of things,
and decide whether they are or are not analogous in ideas to the myths which spring from the
wild and ignorant fancy of Australians, Cahrocs, Nootkas and Bushmen.

The authorities for Greek cosmogonic myth are extremely various in date, character and value.
The most ancient texts are the Iliad and the poems attributed to Hesiod. The Iliad, whatever
its date, whatever the place of its composition, was intended to please a noble class of warriors.
The Hesiodic poems, at least the Theogony, have clearly a didactic aim, and the intention of
presenting a systematic and orderly account of the divine genealogies. To neither would we
willingly attribute a date much later than the ninth century of our era, but the question of
the dates of all the epic and Hesiodic poems, and even of their various parts, is greatly disputed
among scholars. Yet it is nowhere denied that, however late the present form of some of the
poems may be, they contain ideas of extreme antiquity. Although the Homeric poems are usually
considered, on the whole, more ancient than those attributed to Hesiod,(1) it is a fact worth
remembering that the notions of the origin of things in Hesiod are much more savage and (as
we hold) much more archaic than the opinions of Homer.

(1) Grote assigns his Theogony to circ. 750 A.D. The Thegony was taught to boys in Greece,
much as the Church Catechism and Bible are taught in England; Aeschines in Ctesiph., 135, p.
73. Libanius, 400 years after Christ (i. 502-509, iv. 874).

While Hesiod offers a complete theogony or genealogy of deities and heroes, Homer gives no
more than hints and allusions to the stormy past of the gods. It is clear, however, that his
conception of that past differed considerably from the traditions of Hesiod. However we explain
it, the Homeric mythology (though itself repugnant to the philosophers from Xenophanes downwards)
is much more mild, pure and humane than the mythology either of Hesiod or of our other Greek
authorities. Some may imagine that Homer retains a clearer and less corrupted memory than Hesiod
possessed of an original and authentic "divine tradition". Others may find in Homer's comparative
purity a proof of the later date of his epics in their present form, or may even proclaim that
Homer was a kind of Cervantes, who wished to laugh the gods away. There is no conceivable or
inconceivable theory about Homer that has not its advocates. For ourselves, we hold that the
divine genius of Homer, though working in an age distant rather than "early," selected instinctively
the purer mythical materials, and burned away the coarser dross of antique legend, leaving
little but the gold which is comparatively refined.

We must remember that it does not follow that any mythical ideas are later than the age of
Homer because we first meet them in poems of a later date. We have already seen that though
the Brahmanas are much later in date of compilation than the Veda, yet a tradition which we
first find in the Brahmanas may be older than the time at which the Veda was compiled. In the
same way, as Mr. Max Muller observes, "we know that certain ideas which we find in later writers
do not occur in Homer. But it does not follow at all that such ideas are all of later growth
or possess a secondary character. One myth may have belonged to one tribe; one god may have
had his chief worship in one locality; and our becoming acquainted with these through a later
poet does not in the least prove their later origin."(1)

(1) Hibbert Lectures, pp. 130, 131.

After Homer and Hesiod, our most ancient authorities for Greek cosmogonic myths are probably
the so-called Orphic fragments. Concerning the dates and the manner of growth of these poems
volumes of erudition have been compiled. As Homer is silent about Orpheus (in spite of the
position which the mythical Thracian bard acquired as the inventor of letters and magic and
the father of the mysteries), it has been usual to regard the Orphic ideas as of late introduction.
We may agree with Grote and Lobeck that these ideas and the ascetic "Orphic mode of life" first
acquired importance in Greece about the time of Epimenides, or, roughly speaking, between 620
and 500 B.C.(1) That age certainly witnessed a curious growth of superstitious fears and of
mystic ceremonies intended to mitigate spiritual terrors. Greece was becoming more intimately
acquainted with Egypt and with Asia, and was comparing her own religion with the beliefs and
rites of other peoples. The times and the minds of men were being prepared for the clear philosophies
that soon "on Argive heights divinely sang". Just as, when the old world was about to accept
Christianity, a deluge of Oriental and barbaric superstitions swept across men's minds, so
immediately before the dawn of Greek philosophy there came an irruption of mysticism and of
spiritual fears. We may suppose that the Orphic poems were collected, edited and probably interpolated,
in this dark hour of Greece. "To me," says Lobeck, "it appears that the verses may be referred
to the age of Onomacritus, an age curious in the writings of ancient poets, and attracted by
the allurements of mystic religions." The style of the surviving fragments is sufficiently
pure and epic; the strange unheard of myths are unlike those which the Alexandrian poets drew
from fountains long lost.(2) But how much in the Orphic myths is imported from Asia or Egypt,
how much is the invention of literary forgers like Onomacritus, how much should be regarded
as the first guesses of the physical poet-philosophers, and how much is truly ancient popular
legend recast in literary form, it is impossible with certainty to determine.

(1) Lobeck, Aglaophamus, i. 317; Grote, iii. 86.

(2) Aglaophamus, i. 611.

We must not regard a myth as necessarily late or necessarily foreign because we first meet
it in an "Orphic composition". If the myth be one of the sort which encounter us in every quarter,
nay, in every obscure nook of the globe, we may plausibly regard it as ancient. If it bear
the distinct marks of being a Neo-platonic pastiche, we may reject it without hesitation. On
the whole, however, our Orphic authorities can never be quoted with much satisfaction. The
later sources of evidence for Greek myths are not of great use to the student of cosmogonic
legend, though invaluable when we come to treat of the established dynasty of gods, the heroes
and the "culture-heroes". For these the authorities are the whole range of Greek literature,
poets, dramatists, philosophers, critics, historians and travellers. We have also the notes
and comments of the scholiasts or commentators on the poets and dramatists. Sometimes these
annotators only darken counsel by their guesses. Sometimes perhaps, especially in the scholia
on the Iliad and Odyssey, they furnish us with a precious myth or popular marchen not otherwise
recorded. The regular professional mythographi, again, of whom Apollodorus (150 B.C.) is the
type, compiled manuals explanatory of the myths which were alluded to by the poets. The scholiasts
and mythographi often retain myths from lost poems and lost plays. Finally, from the travellers
and historians we occasionally glean examples of the tales ("holy chapters," as Mr. Grote calls
them) which were narrated by priests and temple officials to the pilgrims who visited the sacred
shrines.

These "chapters" are almost invariably puerile, savage and obscene. They bear the stamp of
extreme antiquity, because they never, as a rule, passed through the purifying medium of literature.
There were many myths too crude and archaic for the purposes of poetry and of the drama. These
were handed down from local priest to local priest, with the inviolability of sacred and immutable
tradition. We have already given a reason for assigning a high antiquity to the local temple
myths. Just as Greeks lived in villages before they gathered into towns, so their gods were
gods of villages or tribes before they were national deities. The local myths are those of
the archaic village state of "culture," more ancient, more savage, than literary narrative.
Very frequently the local legends were subjected to the process of allegorical interpretation,
as men became alive to the monstrosity of their unsophisticated meaning. Often they proved
too savage for our authorities, who merely remark, "Concerning this a certain holy chapter
is told," but decline to record the legend. In the same way missionaries, with mistaken delicacy,
often refuse to repeat some savage legend with which they are acquainted.

The latest sort of testimony as to Greek myths must be sought in the writings of the heathen
apologists or learned Pagan defenders of Paganism in the first centuries during Christianity,
and in the works of their opponents, the fathers of the Church. Though the fathers certainly
do not understate the abominations of Paganism, and though the heathen apologists make free
use of allegorical (and impossible) interpretations, the evidence of both is often useful and
important. The testimony of ancient art, vases, statues, pictures and the descriptions of these
where they no longer survive, are also of service and interest.

After this brief examination of the sources of our knowledge of Greek myth, we may approach
the Homeric legends of the origin of things and the world's beginning. In Homer these matters
are only referred to incidentally. He more than once calls Oceanus (that is, the fabled stream
which flows all round the world, here regarded as a PERSON) "the origin of the gods," "the
origin of all things".(1) That Ocean is considered a person, and that he is not an allegory
for water or the aqueous element, appears from the speech of Hera to Aphrodite: "I am going
to visit the limits of the bountiful earth, and Oceanus, father of the gods, and mother Tethys,
who reared me duly and nurtured me in their halls, when far-seeing Zeus imprisoned Cronus beneath
the earth and the unvintaged sea".(2) Homer does not appear to know Uranus as the father of
Cronus, and thus the myth of the mutilation of Uranus necessarily does not occur in Homer.
Cronus, the head of the dynasty which preceded that of Zeus, is described(3) as the son of
Rhea, but nothing is said of his father. The passage contains the account which Poseidon himself
chose to give of the war in heaven: "Three brethren are we, and sons of Cronus whom Rhea bare--Zeus
and myself, and Hades is the third, the ruler of the folk in the underworld. And in three lots
were all things divided, and each drew a domain of his own." Here Zeus is the ELDEST son of
Cronus. Though lots are drawn at hazard for the property of the father (which we know to have
been customary in Homer's time), yet throughout the Iliad Zeus constantly claims the respect
and obedience due to him by right of primogeniture.(4) We shall see that Hesiod adopts exactly
the opposite view. Zeus is the YOUNGEST child of Cronus. His supremacy is an example of jungsten
recht, the wide-spread custom which makes the youngest child the heir in chief.(5) But how
did the sons of Cronus come to have his property in their hands to divide? By right of successful
rebellion, when "Zeus imprisoned Cronus beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea". With Cronus
in his imprisonment are the Titans. That is all that Homer cares to tell about the absolute
beginning of things and the first dynasty of rulers of Olympus. His interest is all in the
actual reigning family, that of the Cronidae, nor is he fond of reporting their youthful excesses.

(1) Iliad, xiv. 201, 302, 246.

(2) In reading what Homer and Hesiod report about these matters, we must remember that all
the forces and phenomena are conceived of by them as PERSONS. In this regard the archaic and
savage view of all things as personal and human is preserved. "I maintain," says Grote, "moreover,
fully the character of these great divine agents as persons, which is the light in which they
presented themselves to the Homeric or Hesiodic audience. Uranus, Nyx, Hypnos and Oneiros (heaven,
night, sleep and dream) are persons just as much as Zeus or Apollo. To resolve them into mere
allegories is unsafe and unprofitable. We then depart from the point of view of the original
hearers without acquiring any consistent or philosophical point of view of our own." This holds
good though portions of the Hesiodic genealogies are distinctly poetic allegories cast in the
mould or the ancient personal theory of things.

(3) Iliad, xv. 187.

(4) The custom by which sons drew lots for equal shares of their dead father's property is
described in Odyssey, xiv. 199-212. Here Odysseus, giving a false account of himself, says
that he was a Cretan, a bastard, and that his half-brothers, born in wedlock, drew lots for
their father's inheritance, and did not admit him to the drawing, but gave him a small portion
apart.

(5) See Elton, Origins of English History, pp. 185-207.

We now turn from Homer's incidental allusions to the ample and systematic narrative of Hesiod.
As Mr. Grote says, "Men habitually took their information respecting their theogonic antiquities
from the Hesiodic poems." Hesiod was accepted as an authority both by the pious Pausanias in
the second century of our era--who protested against any attempt to alter stories about the
gods--and by moral reformers like Plato and Xenophanes, who were revolted by the ancient legends,(1)
and, indeed, denied their truth. Yet, though Hesiod represents Greek orthodoxy, we have observed
that Homer (whose epics are probably still more ancient) steadily ignores the more barbarous
portions of Hesiod's narrative. Thus the question arises: Are the stories of Hesiod's invention,
and later than Homer, or does Homer's genius half-unconsciously purify materials like those
which Hesiod presents in the crudest form? Mr. Grote says: "How far these stories are the invention
of Hesiod himself it is impossible to determine. They bring us down to a cast of fancy more
coarse and indelicate than the Homeric, and more nearly resemble some of the holy chapters
((Greek text omitted)) of the more recent mysteries, such, for example, as the tale of Dionysus
Zagreus. There is evidence in the Theogony itself that the author was acquainted with local
legends current both at Krete and at Delphi, for he mentions both the mountain-cave in Krete
wherein the newly-born Zeus was hidden, and the stone near the Delphian temple--the identical
stone which Kronos had swallowed--placed by Zeus himself as a sign and marvel to mortal men.
Both these monuments, which the poet expressly refers to, and had probably seen, imply a whole
train of accessory and explanatory local legends, current probably among the priests of Krete
and Delphi."

(1) Timaeeus, 41; Republic, 377.

All these circumstances appear to be good evidence of the great antiquity of the legends recorded
by Hesiod. In the first place, arguing merely a priori, it is extremely improbable that in
the brief interval between the date of the comparatively pure and noble mythology of the Iliad
and the much ruder Theogony of Hesiod men INVENTED stories like the mutilation of Uranus, and
the swallowing of his offspring by Cronus. The former legend is almost exactly parallel, as
has already been shown, to the myth of Papa and Rangi in New Zealand. The later has its parallels
among the savage Bushmen and Australians. It is highly improbable that men in an age so civilised
as that of Homer invented myths as hideous as those of the lowest savages. But if we take these
myths to be, not new inventions, but the sacred stories of local priesthoods, their antiquity
is probably incalculable. The sacred stories, as we know from Pausanias, Herodotus and from
all the writers who touch on the subject of the mysteries, were myths communicated by the priests
to the initiated. Plato speaks of such myths in the Republic, 378: "If there is an absolute
necessity for their mention, a very few might hear them in a mystery, and then let them sacrifice,
not a common pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; this would have the effect of very
greatly diminishing the number of the hearers". This is an amusing example of a plan for veiling
the horrors of myth. The pig was the animal usually offered to Demeter, the goddess of the
Eleusinian mysteries. Plato proposes to substitute some "unprocurable" beast, perhaps a giraffe
or an elephant.

To Hesiod, then, we must turn for what is the earliest complete literary form of the Greek
cosmogonic myth. Hesiod begins, like the New Zealanders, with "the august race of gods, by
earth and wide heaven begotten".(1) So the New Zealanders, as we have seen, say, "The heaven
which is above us, and the earth which is beneath us, are the progenitors of men and the origin
of all things". Hesiod(2) somewhat differs from this view by making Chaos absolutely first
of all things, followed by "wide-bosomed Earth," Tartarus and Eros (love). Chaos unaided produced
Erebus and Night; the children of Night and Erebus are Aether and Day. Earth produced Heaven,
who then became her own lover, and to Heaven she bore Oceanus, and the Titans, Coeeus and Crius,
Hyperion and Iapetus, Thea and Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys, "and youngest after
these was born Cronus of crooked counsel, the most dreadful of her children, who ever detested
his puissant sire," Heaven. There were other sons of Earth and Heaven peculiarly hateful to
their father,(3) and these Uranus used to hide from the light in a hollow of Gaea. Both they
and Gaea resented this treatment, and the Titans, like "the children of Heaven and Earth,"
in the New Zealand poem, "sought to discern the difference between light and darkness". Gaea
(unlike Earth in the New Zealand myth, for there she is purely passive), conspired with her
children, produced iron, and asked her sons to avenge their wrongs.(4) Fear fell upon all of
them save Cronus, who (like Tane Mahuta in the Maori poem) determined to end the embraces of
Earth and Heaven. But while the New Zealand, like the Indo-Aryan myth,(5) conceives of Earth
and Heaven as two beings who have never previously been sundered at all, Hesiod makes Heaven
amorously approach his spouse from a distance. This was the moment for Cronus,(6) who stretched
out his hand armed with the sickle of iron, and mutilated Uranus. As in so many savage myths,
the blood of the wounded god fallen on the ground produced strange creatures, nymphs of the
ash-tree, giants and furies. As in the Maori myth, one of the children of Heaven stood apart
and did not consent to the deed. This was Oceanus in Greece,(7) and in New Zealand it was Tawhiri
Matea, the wind, "who arose and followed his father, Heaven, and remained with him in the open
spaces of the sky". Uranus now predicted(8) that there would come a day of vengeance for the
evil deed of Cronus, and so ends the dynasty of Uranus.

This story was one of the great stumbling-blocks of orthodox Greece. It was the tale that Plato
said should be told, if at all, only to a few in a mystery, after the sacrifice of some rare
and scarcely obtainable animal. Even among the Maoris, the conduct of the children who severed
their father and mother is regarded as a singular instance of iniquity, and is told to children
as a moral warning, an example to be condemned. In Greece, on the other hand, unless we are
to take the Euthyphro as wholly ironical, some of the pious justified their conduct by the
example of Zeus. Euthyphro quotes this example when he is about to prosecute his own father,
for which act, he says, "Men are angry with ME; so inconsistently do they talk when I am concerned
and when the gods are concerned".(1) But in Greek THE TALE HAS NO MEANING. It has been allegorised
in various ways, and Lafitau fancied that it was a distorted form of the Biblical account of
the origin of sin. In Maori the legend is perfectly intelligible. Heaven and earth were conceived
of (like everything else), as beings with human parts and passions, linked in an endless embrace
which crushed and darkened their children. It became necessary to separate them, and this feat
was achieved not without pain. "Then wailed the Heaven, and exclaimed the Earth, 'Wherefore
this murder? Why this great sin? Why separate us?' But what cared Tane? Upwards he sent one
and downwards the other. He cruelly severed the sinews which united Heaven and Earth."(2) The
Greek myth too, contemplated earth and heaven as beings corporeally united, and heaven as a
malignant power that concealed his children in darkness.

But while the conception of heaven and earth as parents of living things remains perfectly
intelligible in one sense, the vivid personification which regarded them as creatures with
human parts and passions had ceased to be intelligible in Greece before the times of the earliest
philosophers. The old physical conception of the pair became a metaphor, and the account of
their rending asunder by their children lost all significance, and seemed to be an abominable
and unintelligible myth. When examined in the light of the New Zealand story, and of the fact
that early peoples do regard all phenomena as human beings, with physical attributes like those
of men, the legend of Cronus, and Uranus, and Gaea ceases to be a mystery. It is, at bottom,
a savage explanation (as in the Samoan story) of the separation of earth and heaven, an explanation
which could only have occurred to people in a state of mind which civilisation has forgotten.

The next generation of Hesiodic gods (if gods we are to call the members of this race of non-natural
men) was not more fortunate than the first in its family relations.

Cronus wedded his sister, Rhea, and begat Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and the youngest,
Zeus. "And mighty Cronus swallowed down each of them, each that came to their mother's knees
from her holy womb, with this intent that none other of the proud sons of heaven should hold
his kingly sway among the immortals. Heaven and Earth had warned him that he too should fall
through his children. Wherefore he kept no vain watch, but spied and swallowed down each of
his offspring, while grief immitigable took possession of Rhea."(1) Rhea, being about to become
the mother of Zeus, took counsel with Uranus and Gaea. By their advice she went to Crete, where
Zeus was born, and, in place of the child, she presented to Cronus a huge stone swathed in
swaddling bands. This he swallowed, and was easy in his mind. Zeus grew up, and by some means,
suggested by Gaea, compelled Zeus to disgorge all his offspring. "And he vomited out the stone
first, as he had swallowed it last."(2) The swallowed children emerged alive, and Zeus fixed
the stone at Pytho (Delphi), where Pausanias(3) had the privilege of seeing it, and where,
as it did not tempt the cupidity of barbarous invaders, it probably still exists. It was not
a large stone, Pausanias says, and the Delphians used to pour oil over it, as Jacob did(4)
to the stone at Bethel, and on feast-days they covered it with wraps of wool. The custom of
smearing fetish-stones (which Theophrastus mentions as one of the practices of the superstitious
man) is clearly a survival from the savage stage of religion. As a rule, however, among savages,
fetish-stones are daubed with red paint (like the face of the wooden ancient Dionysi in Greece,
and of Tsui Goab among the Hottentots), not smeared with oil.(5)

palm of the hand, and rubbed with red ochre.--Spencer and Gillen. They are "sacred things,"
but not exactly fetishes.

The myth of the swallowing and disgorging of his own children by Cronus was another of the
stumbling-blocks of Greek orthodoxy. The common explanation, that Time ((Greek text omitted))
does swallow his children, the days, is not quite satisfactory. Time brings never the past
back again, as Cronus did. Besides, the myth of the swallowing is not confined to Cronus. Modern
philology has given, as usual, different analyses of the meaning of the name of the god. Hermann,
with Preller, derives it from (Greek text omitted), to fulfil. The harvest-month, says Preller,
was named Cronion in Greece, and Cronia was the title of the harvest-festival. The sickle of
Cronus is thus brought into connection with the sickle of the harvester.(1)

(1) Preller, Gr. Myth., i. 44; Hartung, ii. 48; Porphyry, Abst., ii. 54. Welcker will not hear
of this etymology, Gr. gott., i. 145, note 9.

The second myth, in which Cronus swallows his children, has numerous parallels in savage legend.
Bushmen tell of Kwai Hemm, the devourer, who swallows that great god, the mantis insect, and
disgorges him alive with all the other persons and animals whom he has engulphed in the course
of a long and voracious career.(1) The moon in Australia, while he lived on earth, was very
greedy, and swallowed the eagle-god, whom he had to disgorge. Mr. Im Thurn found similar tales
among the Indians of Guiana. The swallowing and disgorging of Heracles by the monster that
was to slay Hesione is well known. Scotch peasants tell of the same feats, but localise the
myth on the banks of the Ken in Galloway. Basutos, Eskimos, Zulus and European fairy tales
all possess this incident, the swallowing of many persons by a being from whose maw they return
alive and in good case.

(1) Bleek, Bushman Folk-lore, pp. 6, 8.

A mythical conception which prevails from Greenland to South Africa, from Delphi to the Solomon
Islands, from Brittany to the shores of Lake Superior, must have some foundation in the common
elements of human nature.(1) Now it seems highly probable that this curious idea may have been
originally invented in an attempt to explain natural phenomena by a nature-myth. It has already
been shown (chapter v.) that eclipses are interpreted, even by the peasantry of advanced races,
as the swallowing of the moon by a beast or a monster. The Piutes account for the disappearance
of the stars in the daytime by the hypothesis that the "sun swallows his children". In the
Melanesian myth, dawn is cut out of the body of night by Qat, armed with a knife of red obsidian.
Here are examples(2) of transparent nature-myths in which this idea occurs for obvious explanatory
purposes, and in accordance with the laws of the savage imagination. Thus the conception of
the swallowing and disgorging being may very well have arisen out of a nature-myth. But why
is the notion attached to the legend of Cronus?

(1) The myth of Cronus and the swallowed children and the stone is transferred to Gargantua.
See Sebillot, Gargantua dans les Traditions Populaires. But it is impossible to be certain
that this is not an example of direct borrowing by Madame De Cerny in her Saint Suliac, p. 69.

(2) Compare Tylor, Prim. Cult., i. 338.

That is precisely the question about which mythologists differ, as has been shown, and perhaps
it is better to offer no explanation. However stories arise--and this story probably arose
from a nature-myth--it is certain that they wander about the world, that they change masters,
and thus a legend which is told of a princess with an impossible name in Zululand is told of
the mother of Charlemagne in France. The tale of the swallowing may have been attributed to
Cronus, as a great truculent deity, though it has no particular elemental signification in
connection with his legend.

This peculiarly savage trick of swallowing each other became an inherited habit in the family
of Cronus. When Zeus reached years of discretion, he married Metis, and this lady, according
to the scholiast on Hesiod, had the power of transforming herself into any shape she pleased.
When she was about to be a mother, Zeus induced her to assume the shape of a fly and instantly
swallowed her.(1) In behaving thus, Zeus acted on the advice of Uranus and Gaea. It was feared
that Metis would produce a child more powerful than his father. Zeus avoided this peril by
swallowing his wife, and himself gave birth to Athene. The notion of swallowing a hostile person,
who has been changed by magic into a conveniently small bulk, is very common. It occurs in
the story of Taliesin.(2) Caridwen, in the shape of a hen, swallows Gwion Bach, in the form
of a grain of wheat. In the same manner the princess in the Arabian Nights swallowed the Geni.
Here then we have in the Hesiodic myth an old marchen pressed into the service of the higher
mythology. The apprehension which Zeus (like Herod and King Arthur) always felt lest an unborn
child should overthrow him, was also familiar to Indra; but, instead of swallowing the mother
and concealing her in his own body, like Zeus, Indra entered the mother's body, and himself
was born instead of the dreaded child.(3) A cow on this occasion was born along with Indra.
This adventure of the (Greek text omitted) or swallowing of Metis was explained by the late
Platonists as a Platonic allegory. Probably the people who originated the tale were not Platonists,
any more than Pandarus was all Aristotelian.

After Homer and Hesiod, the oldest literary authorities for Greek cosmogonic myths are the
poems attributed to Orpheus. About their probable date, as has been said, little is known.
They have reached us only in fragments, but seem to contain the first guesses of a philosophy
not yet disengaged from mythical conditions. The poet preserves, indeed, some extremely rude
touches of early imagination, while at the same time one of the noblest and boldest expressions
of pantheistic thought is attributed to him. From the same source are drawn ideas as pure as
those of the philosophical Vedic hymn,(1) and as wild as those of the Vedic Purusha Sukta,
or legend of the fashioning of the world out of the mangled limbs of Purusha. The authors of
the Orphic cosmogony appear to have begun with some remarks on Time ((Greek text omitted)).
"Time was when as yet this world was not."(2) Time, regarded in the mythical fashion as a person,
generated Chaos and Aether. The Orphic poet styles Chaos (Greek text omitted), "the monstrous
gulph," or "gap". This term curiously reminds one of Ginnunga-gap in the Scandinavian cosmogonic
legends. "Ginnunga-gap was light as windless air," and therein the blast of heat met the cold
rime, whence Ymir was generated, the Purusha of Northern fable.(3) These ideas correspond well
with the Orphic conception of primitive space.(4)

(2) Lobeck, Aglaophamus, i. 470. See also the quotations from Proclus.

(3) Gylfi's Mocking.

(4) Aglaophamus, p. 473.

In process of time Chaos produced an egg, shining and silver white. It is absurd to inquire,
according to Lobeck, whether the poet borrowed this widely spread notion of a cosmic egg from
Phoenicia, Babylon, Egypt (where the goose-god Seb laid the egg), or whether the Orphic singer
originated so obvious an idea. Quaerere ludicrum est. The conception may have been borrowed,
but manifestly it is one of the earliest hypotheses that occur to the rude imagination. We
have now three primitive generations, time, chaos, the egg, and in the fourth generation the
egg gave birth to Phanes, the great hero of the Orphic cosmogony.(1) The earliest and rudest
thinkers were puzzled, as many savage cosmogonic myths have demonstrated, to account for the
origin of life. The myths frequently hit on the theory of a hermaphroditic being, both male
and female, who produces another being out of himself. Prajapati in the Indian stories, and
Hrimthursar in Scandinavian legend--"one of his feet got a son on the other"--with Lox in the
Algonquin tale are examples of these double-sexed personages. In the Orphic poem, Phanes is
both male and female. This Phanes held within him "the seed of all the gods,"(2) and his name
is confused with the names of Metis and Ericapaeus in a kind of trinity. All this part of the
Orphic doctrine is greatly obscured by the allegorical and theosophistic interpretations of
the late Platonists long after our era, who, as usual, insisted on finding their own trinitarian
ideas, commenta frigidissima, concealed under the mythical narrative.(3)

(1) Clemens Alexan., p. 672.

(2) Damascius, ap. Lobeck, i. 481.

(3) Aglaoph., i. 483.

Another description by Hieronymus of the first being, the Orphic Phanes, "as a serpent with
bull's and lion's heads, with a human face in the middle and wings on the shoulders," is sufficiently
rude and senseless. But these physical attributes could easily be explained away as types of
anything the Platonist pleased.(1) The Orphic Phanes, too, was almost as many-headed as a giant
in a fairy tale, or as Purusha in the Rig-Veda. He had a ram's head, a bull's head, a snake's
head and a lion's head, and glanced around with four eyes, presumably human.(2) This remarkable
being was also provided with golden wings. The nature of the physical arrangements by which
Phanes became capable of originating life in the world is described in a style so savage and
crude that the reader must be referred to Suidas for the original text.(3) The tale is worthy
of the Swift-like fancy of the Australian Narrinyeri.

(2) Hermias in Phaedr. ap. Lobeck, i. 493.

(3) Suidas s. v. Phanes.

Nothing can be easier or more delusive than to explain all this wild part of the Orphic cosmogony
as an allegorical veil of any modern ideas we choose to select. But why the "allegory" should
closely imitate the rough guesses of uncivilised peoples, Ahts, Diggers, Zunis, Cahrocs, it
is less easy to explain. We can readily imagine African or American tribes who were accustomed
to revere bulls, rams, snakes, and so forth, ascribing the heads of all their various animal
patrons to the deity of their confederation. We can easily see how such races as practise the
savage rites of puberty should attribute to the first being the special organs of Phanes. But
on the Neo-Platonic hypothesis that Orpheus was a seer of Neo-Platonic opinions, we do not
see why he should have veiled his ideas under so savage an allegory. This part of the Orphic
speculation is left in judicious silence by some modern commentators, such as M. Darmesteter
in Les Cosmogonies Aryennes.(1) Indeed, if we choose to regard Apollonius Rhodius, an Alexandrine
poet writing in a highly civilised age, as the representative of Orphicism, it is easy to mask
and pass by the more stern and characteristic fortresses of the Orphic divine. The theriomorphic
Phanes is a much less "Aryan" and agreeable object than the glorious golden-winged Eros, the
love-god of Apollonius Rhodius and Aristophanes.(2)

(2) Argonautica, 1-12; Aves, 693.

On the whole, the Orphic fragments appear to contain survivals of savage myths of the origin
of things blended with purer speculations. The savage ideas are finally explained by late philosophers
as allegorical veils and vestments of philosophy; but the interpretation is arbitrary, and
varies with the taste and fancy of each interpreter. Meanwhile the coincidence of the wilder
elements with the speculations native to races in the lowest grades of civilisation is undeniable.
This opinion is confirmed by the Greek myths of the origin of Man. These, too, coincide with
the various absurd conjectures of savages.

In studying the various Greek local legends of the origin of Man, we encounter the difficulty
of separating them from the myths of heroes, which it will be more convenient to treat separately.
This difficulty we have already met in our treatment of savage traditions of the beginnings
of the race. Thus we saw that among the Melanesians, Qat, and among the Ahts, Quawteaht, were
heroic persons, who made men and most other things. But it was desirable to keep their performances
of this sort separate from their other feats, their introduction of fire, for example, and
of various arts. In the same way it will be well, in reviewing Greek legends, to keep Prometheus'
share in the making of men apart from the other stories of his exploits as a benefactor of
the men whom he made. In Hesiod, Prometheus is the son of the Titan Iapetus, and perhaps his
chief exploit is to play upon Zeus a trick of which we find the parallel in various savage
myths. It seems, however, from Ovid(1) and other texts, that Hesiod somewhere spoke of Prometheus
as having made men out of clay, like Pund-jel in the Australian, Qat in the Melanesian and
Tiki in the Maori myths. The same story is preserved in Servius's commentary on Virgil.(2)
A different legend is preserved in the Etymologicum Magnum (voc. Ikonion). According to this
story, after the deluge of Deucalion, "Zeus bade Prometheus and Athene make images of men out
of clay, and the winds blew into them the breath of life". In confirmation of this legend,
Pausanias was shown in Phocis certain stones of the colour of clay, and "smelling very like
human flesh"; and these, according to the Phocians, were "the remains of the clay from which
the whole human race was fashioned by Prometheus".(3)

(1) Ovid. Metam. i. 82.

(2) Eclogue, vi. 42.

(3) Pausanias, x. 4, 3.

Aristophanes, too, in the Birds (686) talks of men as (Greek text omitted), figures kneaded
of clay. Thus there are sufficient traces in Greek tradition of the savage myth that man was
made of clay by some superior being, like Pund-jel in the quaint Australian story.

We saw that among various rude races other theories of the origin of man were current. Men
were thought to have come out of a hole in the ground or a bed of reeds, and sometimes the
very scene of their first appearance was still known and pointed out to the curious. This myth
was current among races who regarded themselves as the only people whose origin needed explanation.
Other stories represented man as the fruit of a tree, or the child of a rock or stone, or as
the descendant of one of the lower animals. Examples of these opinions in Greek legend are
now to be given. In the first place, we have a fragment of Pindar, in which the poet enumerates
several of the centres from which different Greek tribes believed men to have sprung. "Hard
it is to find out whether Alalkomeneus, first of men, arose on the marsh of Cephissus, or whether
the Curetes of Ida first, a stock divine, arose, or if it was the Phrygian Corybantes that
the sun earliest saw--men like trees walking;" and Pindar mentions Egyptian and Libyan legends
of the same description.(1) The Thebans and the Arcadians held themselves to be "earth-born".
"The black earth bore Pelasgus on the high wooded hills," says an ancient line of Asius. The
Dryopians were an example of a race of men born from ash-trees. The myth of gens virum truncis
et duro robore nata, "born of tree-trunk and the heart of oak," had passed into a proverb even
in Homer's time.(2) Lucian mentions(3) the Athenian myth "that men grew like cabbages out of
the earth". As to Greek myths of the descent of families from animals, these will be examined
in the discussion of the legend of Zeus.

"The question of the origin of a belief in Deity does not come within the scope of a strictly
historical inquiry. No man can watch the idea of GOD in the making or in the beginning. We
are acquainted with no race whose beginning does not lie far back in the unpenetrated past.
Even on the hypothesis that the natives of Australia, for example, were discovered in a state
of culture more backward than that of other known races, yet the institutions and ideas of
the Australians must have required for their development an incalculable series of centuries.
The notions of man about the Deity, man's religious sentiments and his mythical narratives,
must be taken as we find them. There have been, and are, many theories as to the origin of
the conception of a supernatural being or beings, concerned with the fortunes of mankind, and
once active in the making of the earth and its inhabitants. There is the hypothesis of an original
divine tradition, darkened by the smoke of foolish mortal fancies. There is the hypothesis
of an innate and intuitive sensus numinis. There is the opinion that the notion of Deity was
introduced to man by the very nature of his knowledge and perceptions, which compel him in
all things to recognise a finite and an infinite. There is the hypothesis that gods were originally
ghosts, the magnified shapes of ancestral spectres. There is the doctrine that man, seeking
in his early speculations for the causes of things, and conscious of his own powers as an active
cause, projected his own shadow on the mists of the unknown, and peopled the void with figures
of magnified non-natural men, his own parents and protectors, and the makers of many of the
things in the world.

"Since the actual truth cannot be determined by observation and experiment, the question as
to the first germs of the divine conception must here be left unanswered. But it is possible
to disengage and examine apart the two chief elements in the earliest as in the latest ideas
of Godhead. Among the lowest and most backward, as among the most advanced races, there coexist
the MYTHICAL and the RELIGIOUS elements in belief. The rational factor (or what approves itself
to us as the rational factor) is visible in religion; the irrational is prominent in myth.
The Australian, the Bushman, the Solomon Islander, in hours of danger and necessity 'yearns
after the gods,' and has present in his heart the idea of a father and friend. This is the
religious element. The same man, when he comes to indulge his fancy for fiction, will degrade
this spiritual friend and father to the level of the beasts, and will make him the hero of
comic or repulsive adventures. This is the mythical or irrational element. Religion, in its
moral aspect, always traces back to the belief in a power that is benign and works for righteousness.
Myth, even in Homer or the Rig-Veda, perpetually falls back on the old stock of absurd and
immoral divine adventures.(1)

(1) M. Knappert here, in a note to the Dutch translation, denies the lowest mythical element
to the Hebrews, as their documents have reached us.

"It would be rash, in the present state of knowledge, to pronounce that the germ of the serious
Homeric sense of the justice and power of the Divinity is earlier or later than the germ of
the Homeric stories of gods disguised as animals, or imprisoned by mortals, or kicked out of
Olympus. The rational and irrational aspects of mythology and religion may be of coeval antiquity
for all that is certainly known, or either of them, in the dark backward of mortal experience,
may have preceded the other. There is probably no religion nor mythology which does not offer
both aspects to the student. But it is the part of advancing civilisation to adorn and purify
the rational element, and to subordinate and supersede the irrational element, as far as religious
conservatism, ritual and priestly dogma will permit."

Such were the general remarks with which this chapter opened in the original edition of the
present work. But reading, reflection and certain additions to the author's knowledge of facts,
have made it seem advisable to state, more fully and forcibly than before, that, in his opinion,
not only the puzzling element of myth, but the purer element of a religious belief sanctioning
morality is derived by civilised people from a remote past of savagery. It is also necessary
to draw attention to a singular religious phenomena, a break, or "fault," as geologists call
it, in the religious strata. While the most backward savages, in certain cases, present the
conception of a Being who sanctions ethics, and while that conception recurs at a given stage
of civilisation, it appears to fade, or even to disappear in some conditions of barbarism.
Among some barbaric peoples, such as the Zulus, and the Red Indians of French Canada when first
observed, as among some Polynesians and some tribes of Western and Central Africa little trace
of a supreme being is found, except a name, and that name is even occasionally a matter of
ridicule. The highest religious conception has been reached, and is generally known, yet the
Being conceived of as creative is utterly neglected, while ghosts, or minor gods, are served
and adored. To this religious phenomenon (if correctly observed) we must attempt to assign
a cause. For this purpose it is necessary to state again what may be called the current or
popular anthropological theory of the evolution of Gods.

That theory takes varying shapes. In the philosophy of Mr. Herbert Spencer we find a pure Euhemerism.
Gods are but ghosts of dead men, raised to a higher and finally to the highest power. In the
somewhat analogous but not identical system of Mr. Tylor, man first attains to the idea of
spirit by reflection on various physical, psychological and psychical experiences, such as
sleep, dreams, trances, shadows, hallucinations, breath and death, and he gradually extends
the conception of soul or ghost till all nature is peopled with spirits. Of these spirits one
is finally promoted to supremacy, where the conception of a supreme being occurs. In the lowest
faiths there is said, on this theory, to be no connection, or very little connection, between
religion and morality. To supply a religious sanction of morals is the work of advancing thought.(1)

(1) Prim. Cult., ii. 381. Huxley's Science and Hebrew Tradition, pp. 346,372.

This current hypothesis is, confessedly, "animistic," in Mr. Tylor's phrase, or, in Mr. Spencer's
terminology, it is "the ghost theory". The human soul, says Mr. Tylor, has been the model on
which all man's ideas of spiritual beings, from "the tiniest elf" to "the heavenly Creator
and ruler of the world, the Great Spirit," have been framed.(1) Thus it has been necessary
for Mr. Tylor and for Mr. Spencer to discover first an origin of man's idea of his own soul,
and that supposed origin in psychological, physical and psychical experiences is no doubt adequate.
By reflection on these facts, probably, the idea of spirit was reached, though the psychical
experiences enumerated by Mr. Tylor may contain points as yet unexplained by Materialism. From
these sources are derived all really "animistic" gods, all that from the first partake of the
nature of hungry ghosts, placated by sacrifices of food, though in certain cases that hunger
may have been transferred, we surmise, by worshippers to gods not ORIGINALLY animistic.

(1) Prim. Cult., ii. 109

In answer to this theory of an animistic or ghostly origin of all gods, it must first be observed
that all gods are not necessarily, it would seem, of animistic origin. Among certain of the
lowest savages, although they believe in ghosts, the animistic conception, the spiritual idea,
is not attached to the relatively supreme being of their faith. He is merely a powerful BEING,
unborn, and not subject to death. The purely metaphysical question "was he a ghost?" does not
seem always to have been asked. Consequently there is no logical reason why man's idea of a
Maker should not be prior to man's idea that there are such things as souls, ghosts and spirits.
Therefore the animistic theory is not necessary as material for the "god-idea". We cannot,
of course, prove that the "god-idea" was historically prior to the "ghost-idea," for we know
no savages who have a god and yet are ignorant of ghosts. But we can show that the idea of
God may exist, in germ, without explicitly involving the idea of spirit. Thus gods MAY be prior
in evolution to ghosts, and therefore the animistic theory of the origin of gods in ghosts
need not necessarily be accepted.

In the first place, the original evolution of a god out of a ghost need not be conceded, because
in perhaps all known savage theological philosophy the God, the Maker and Master, is regarded
as a being who existed before death entered the world. Everywhere, practically speaking, death
is looked on as a comparatively late intruder. He came not only after God was active, but after
men and beasts had populated the world. Scores of myths accounting for this invasion of death
have been collected all over the world.(1) Thus the relatively supreme being, or beings, of
religion are looked on as prior to Death, therefore, not as ghosts. They are sometimes expressly
distinguished as "original gods" from other gods who are secondary, being souls of chiefs.
Thus all Tongan gods are Atua, but all Atua are not "original gods".(2) The word Atua, according
to Mr. White, is "A-tu-a". "A" was the name given to the author of the universe, and signifies:
"Am the unlimited in power," "The Conception," "the Leader," "the Beyond All". "Tua" means
"Beyond that which is most distant," "Behind all matter," and "Behind every action". Clearly
these conceptions are not more mythical (indeed A does not seem to occur in the myths), nor
are they more involved in ghosts, than the unknown absolute of Mr. Herbert Spencer. Yet the
word Atua denotes gods who are recognised as ghosts of chiefs, no less than it denotes the
supreme existence.(3) These ideas are the metaphysical theology of a race considerably above
the lowest level. They lend no assistance to a theory that A was, or was evolved out of, a
human ghost, and he is not found in Maori MYTHOLOGY as far as our knowledge goes. But, among
the lowest known savages, the Australians, we read that "the Creator was a gigantic black,
once on earth, now among the stars". This is in Gippsland; the deities of the Fuegians and
the Blackfoot Indians are also Beings, anthropomorphic, unborn and undying, like Mangarrah,
the creative being of the Larrakeah tribe in Australia. "A very good man called Mangarrah lives
in the sky.... He made everything" (blacks excepted). He never dies.(4) The Melanesian Vui
"never were men," were "something different," and "were NOT ghosts". It is as a Being, not
as a Spirit, that the Kurnai deity Munganngaur (Our Father) is described.(5) In short, though
Europeans often speak of these divine beings of low savages as "spirits," it does not appear
that the natives themselves advance here the metaphysical idea of spirit. These gods are just
BEINGS, anthropomorphic, or (in myth and fable), very often bestial, "theriomorphic".(6) It
is manifest that a divine being envisaged thus need not have been evolved out of the theory
of spirits or ghosts, and may even have been prior to the rise of the belief in ghosts.

Again, these powerful, or omnipotent divine beings are looked on as guardians of morality,
punishers of sin, rewarders of righteousness, both in this world and in a future life, in places
where ghosts, though believed in, ARE NOT WORSHIPPED, NOR IN RECEIPT OF SACRIFICE, and where,
great grandfathers being forgotten, ancestral ghosts can scarcely swell into gods. This occurs
among Andamanese, Fuegians and Australians, therefore, among non-ghost-worshipping races, ghosts
cannot have developed into deities who are not even necessarily spirits. These gods, again,
do not receive sacrifice, and thus lack the note of descent from hungry food-craving ghosts.
In Australia, indeed, while ghosts are not known to receive any offerings, "the recent custom
of providing food for it"--the dead body of a friend--"is derided by the intelligent old aborigines
as 'white fellow's gammon'".(1)

(1) Dawson, Australian Aborigines, p. 51, 1881.

The Australians possess no chiefs like "Vich Ian Vohr or Chingachgook" whose ghosts might be
said to swell into supreme moral deities. "Headmen" they have, leaders of various degrees of
authority, but no Vich Ian Vohr, no semi-sacred representative of the tribe.(1) Nor are the
ghosts of the Headmen known to receive any particular posthumous attention or worship. Thus
it really seems impossible to show proof that Australian gods grew out of Australian ghosts,
a subject to which we shall return.

(1) Howitt, Organisation of Australian Tribes, pp. 101-113. "Transactions of Royal Society
of Victoria," 1889.

Some supporters of the current theory therefore fall back on the hypothesis that the Australians
are sadly degenerate.(1) Chiefs, it is argued, or kings, they once had, and the gods are surviving
ghosts of these wholly forgotten potentates. To this we reply that we know not the very faintest
trace of Australian degeneration. Sir John Lubbock and Mr. Tylor have correctly argued that
the soil of Australia has not yet yielded so much as a fragment of native pottery, nor any
trace of native metal work, not a vestige of stone buildings occurs, nor of any work beyond
the present native level of culture, unless we reckon weirs for fish-catching. "The Australian
boomerang," writes Mr. Tylor, "has been claimed as derived from some hypothetical high culture,
whereas the transition-stages through which it is connected with the club are to be observed
in its own country, while no civilised race possesses the weapon."(2)

(1) See Prof. Menzie's History of Religion, pp. 16, 17, where a singular inconsistency has
escaped the author.

(2) Prim. Cult., i. 57, 67.

Therefore the Australian, with his boomerang, represents no degeneration but advance on his
ancestors, who had not yet developed the boomerang out of the club. If the excessively complex
nature of Australian rules of prohibited degrees be appealed to as proof of degeneration from
the stage in which they were evolved, we reply that civilisation everywhere tends not to complicate
but to simplify such rules, as it also notoriously simplifies the forms of language.

The Australian people, when discovered, were only emerging from palaeolithic culture, while
the neighbouring Tasmanians were frankly palaeolithic.(1) Far from degenerating, the Australians
show advance when they supersede their beast or other totem by an eponymous human hero.(2)
The eponymous hero, however, changed with each generation, so that no one name was fixed as
that of tribal father, later perhaps to become a tribal god. We find several tribes in which
the children now follow the FATHER'S class, and thus paternal kin takes the place of the usual
early savage method of reckoning kinship by the mother's side, elsewhere prevalent in Australia.
In one of these tribes, dwelling between the Glenelg and Mount Napier, headmanship is hereditary,
but nothing is said of any worship of the ghosts of chiefs. All this social improvement denotes
advance on the usual Australian standard.(3) Of degeneration (except when produced recently
by European vices and diseases) I know no trace in Australia. Their highest religious conceptions,
therefore, are not to be disposed of as survivals of a religion of the ghosts of such chiefs
as the Australians are not shown ever to have recognised. The "God idea" in Australia, or among
the Andamanese, must have some other source than the Ghost-Theory. This is all the more obvious
because not only are ghosts not worshipped by the Australians, but also the divine beings who
are alleged to form links between the ghost and the moral god are absent. There are no departmental
gods, as of war, peace, the chase, love, and so forth. Sun, sky and earth are equally unworshipped.
There is nothing in religion between a Being, on one hand (with a son or sons), and vague mischievous
spirits, boilyas or mrarts, and ghosts (who are not worshipped), on the other hand. The friends
of the idea that the God is an ancient evolution from the ghost of such a chief as is not proved
to have existed, must apparently believe that the intermediate stages in religious evolution,
departmental gods, nature gods and gods of polytheism in general once existed in Australia,
and have all been swept away in a deluge of degeneration. That deluge left in religion a moral,
potently active Father and Judge. Now that conception is considerably above the obsolescent
belief in an otiose god which is usually found among barbaric races of the type from which
the Australians are said to have degenerated. There is no proof of degeneracy, and, if degeneration
has occurred, why has it left just the kind of deity who, in the higher barbaric culture, is
not commonly found? Clearly this attempt to explain the highest aspect of Australian religion
by an undemonstrated degeneration is an effort of despair.

While the current theory thus appears to break down over the deities of certain Australian
tribes and of other low savages to be more particularly described later, it is not more successful
in dealing with what we have called the "fault" or break in the religious strata of higher
races. The nature of that "fault" may thus be described: While the deities of several low savage
peoples are religiously regarded as guardians and judges of conduct both in this life and in
the next, among higher barbarians they are often little, or not at all, interested in conduct.
Again, while among Australians, and Andamanese, and Fuegians, there is hardly a verifiable
trace, if any trace there be, of sacrifice to any divine being, among barbarians the gods beneath
the very highest are in receipt even of human sacrifice. Even among barbarians the highest
deity is very rarely worshipped with sacrifice. Through various degrees he is found to lose
all claim on worship, and even to become a mere name, and finally a jest and a mockery. Meanwhile
ancestral ghosts, and gods framed on the same lines as ghosts, receive sacrifice of food and
of human victims. Once more, the high gods of low savages are not localised, not confined to
any temple or region. But the gods of higher barbarians (the gods beneath the highest), are
localised in this way, as occasionally even the highest god also is.

All this shows that, among advancing barbarians, the gods, if they started from the estate
of gods among savages on the lowest level, become demoralised, limited, conditioned, relegated
to an otiose condition, and finally deposed, till progressive civilisation, as in Greece, reinstates
or invents purer and more philosophic conceptions, without being able to abolish popular and
priestly myth and ritual.

Here, then, is a flaw or break in the strata of religion. What was the cause of this flaw?
We answer, the evolution, through ghosts, of "animistic" gods who retained the hunger and selfishness
of these ancestral spirits whom the lowest savages are not known to worship.

The moral divine beings of these lowest races, beings (when religiously regarded) unconditioned,
in need of no gift that man can give, are not to be won by offerings of food and blood. Of
such offerings ghosts, and gods modelled on ghosts, are notoriously in need. Strengthened and
propitiated by blood and sacrifice (not offered to the gods of low savages), the animistic
deities will become partisans of their adorers, and will either pay no regard to the morals
of their worshippers, or will be easily bribed to forgive sins. Here then is, ethically speaking,
a flaw in the strata of religion, a flaw found in the creeds of ghost-worshipping barbarians,
but not of non-ghost-worshipping savages. A crowd of venal, easy-going, serviceable deities
has now been evolved out of ghosts, and Animism is on its way to supplant or overlay a rude
early form of theism. Granting the facts, we fail to see how they are explained by the current
theory which makes the highest god the latest in evolution from a ghost. That theory wrecks
itself again on the circumstance that, whereas the tribal or national highest divine being,
as latest in evolution, ought to be the most potent, he is, in fact, among barbaric races,
usually the most disregarded. A new idea, of course, is not necessarily a powerful or fashionable
idea. It may be regarded as a "fad," or a heresy, or a low form of dissent. But, when universally
known to and accepted by a tribe or people, then it must be deemed likely to possess great
influence. But that is not the case; and among barbaric tribes the most advanced conception
of deity is the least regarded, the most obsolete.

An excellent instance of the difference between the theory here advocated, and that generally
held by anthropologists, may be found in Mr. Abercromby's valuable work, Pre-and Proto-Historic
Finns, i. 150-154. The gods, and other early ideas, says Mr. Abercromby, "could in no sense
be considered as supernatural". We shall give examples of gods among the races "nearest the
beginning," whose attributes of power and knowledge can not, by us at least, be considered
other than "supernatural". "The gods" (in this hypothesis) "were so human that they could be
forced to act in accordance with the wishes of their worshippers, and could likewise be punished."
These ideas, to an Australian black, or an Andamanese, would seem dangerously blasphemous.
These older gods "resided chiefly in trees, wells, rivers and animals". But many gods of our
lowest known savages live "beyond the sky". Mr. Abercromby supposes the sky god to be of later
evolution, and to be worshipped after man had exhausted "the helpers that seemed nearest at
hand... in the trees and waters at his very door". Now the Australian black has not a door,
nor has he gods of any service to him in the "trees and waters," though sprites may lurk in
such places for mischief. But in Mr. Abercromby's view, some men turned at last to the sky-god,
"who in time would gain a large circle of worshippers". He would come to be thought omnipotent,
omniscient, the Creator. This notion, says Mr. Abercromby, "must, if this view is correct,
be of late origin". But the view is not correct. The far-seeing powerful Maker beyond the sky
is found among the very backward races who have not developed helpers nearer man, dwelling
round what would be his door, if door he was civilised enough to possess. Such near neighbouring
gods, of human needs, capable of being bullied, or propitiated by sacrifice, are found in races
higher than the lowest, who, for their easily procurable aid, have allowed the Maker to sink
into an otiose god, or a mere name. Mr. Abercromby unconsciously proves our case by quoting
the example of a Samoyede. This man knew a Sky-god, Num; that conception was familiar to him.
He also knew a familiar spirit. On Mr. Abercromby's theory he should have resorted for help
to the Sky-god, not to the sprite. But he did the reverse: he said, "I cannot approach Num,
he is too far away; if I could reach him I should not beseech thee (the familiar spirit), but
should go myself; but I cannot". For this precise reason, people who have developed the belief
in accessible affable spirits go to them, with a spell to constrain, or a gift to bribe, and
neglect, in some cases almost forget, their Maker. But He is worshipped by low savages, who
do not propitiate ghosts and who have no gods in wells and trees, close at hand. It seems an
obvious inference that the greater God is the earlier evolved.

These are among the difficulties of the current anthropological theory. There is, however,
a solution by which the weakness of the divine conception, its neglected, disused aspect among
barbaric races, might be explained by anthropologists, without regarding it as an obsolescent
form of a very early idea. This solution is therefore in common use. It is applied to the deity
revealed in the ancient mysteries of the Australians, and it is employed in American and African
instances.

The custom is to say that the highest divine being of American or African native peoples has
been borrowed from Europeans, and is, especially, a savage refraction from the God of missionaries.
If this can be proved, the shadowy, practically powerless "Master of Life" of certain barbaric
peoples, will have degenerated from the Christian conception, because of that conception he
will be only a faint unsuccessful refraction. He has been introduced by Europeans, it is argued,
but is not in harmony with his new environment, and so is "half-remembered and half forgot".

The hypothesis of borrowing admits of only one answer, but that answer should be conclusive.
If we can discover, say in North America, a single instance in which the supreme being occurs,
while yet he cannot possibly be accounted for by any traceable or verifiable foreign influence,
then the burden of proof, in other cases, falls on the opponent. When he urges that other North
American supreme beings were borrowed, we can reply that our crucial example shows that this
need not be the fact. To prove that it is the fact, in his instances, is then his business.
It is obvious that for information on this subject we must go to the reports of the earliest
travellers who knew the Red Indians well. We must try to get at gods behind any known missionary
efforts. Mr. Tylor offers us the testimony of Heriot, about 1586, that the natives of Virginia
believed in many gods, also in one chief god, "who first made other principal gods, and then
the sun, moon and stars as petty gods".(1) Whence could the natives of Virginia have borrowed
this notion of a Creator before 1586? If it is replied, in the usual way, that they developed
him upwards out of sun, moon and star gods, other principal gods, and finally reached the idea
of the Creator, we answer that the idea of the Maker is found where these alleged intermediate
stages are NOT found, as in Australia. In Virginia then, as in Victoria, a Creator may have
been evolved in some other way than that of gradual ascent from ghosts, and may have been,
as in Australia and elsewhere, prior to verifiable ghost-worship. Again, in Virginia at our
first settlement, the native priests strenuously resisted the introduction of Christianity.
They were content with their deity, Ahone, "the great God who governs all the world, and makes
the sun to shine, creating the moon and stars his companions.... The good and peaceable God...
needs not to be sacrificed unto, for he intendeth all good unto them." This good Creator, without
sacrifice, among a settled agricultural barbaric race sacrificing to other gods and ghosts,
manifestly cannot be borrowed from the newly arrived religion of Christianity, which his priests,
according to the observer, vigorously resisted. Ahone had a subordinate deity, magisterial
in functions, "looking into all men's actions" and punishing the same, when evil. To THIS god
sacrifices WERE made, and if his name, Okeus, is derived from Oki = "spirit," he was, of course,
an animistic ghost-evolved deity. Anthropological writers, by an oversight, have dwelt on Oki,
but have not mentioned Ahone.(2) Manifestly it is not possible to insist that these Virginian
high deities were borrowed, without saying whence and when they were borrowed by a barbaric
race which was, at the same time, rejecting Christian teaching.

(1) Prim. Cult., ii. 341.

(2) History of Travaile into Virginia, by William Strachey, 1612.

Mr. Tylor writes, with his habitual perspicacity: "It is the widespread belief in the Great
Spirit, whatever his precise nature and origin, that has long and deservedly drawn the attention
of European thinkers to the native religions of the North American tribes". Now while, in recent
times, Christian ideas may undeniably have crystallised round "the Great Spirit," it has come
to be thought "that THE WHOLE DOCTRINE of the Great Spirit was borrowed by the savages from
missionaries and colonists. But this view will not bear examination," says Mr. Tylor.(1)

(1) Prim. Cult, ii. pp. 339, 340 (1873). For some reason, Mr. Tylor modifies this passage in 1891.

Mr. Tylor proceeds to prove this by examples from Greenland, and the Algonkins. He instances
the Massachusett God, Kiehtan, who created the other gods, and receives the just into heaven.
This was recorded in 1622, but the belief, says Winslow, our authority, goes back into the
unknown past. "They never saw Kiehtan, but THEY HOLD IT A GREAT CHARGE AND DUTY THAT ONE AGE
TEACH ANOTHER." How could a deity thus rooted in a traditional past be borrowed from recent
English settlers?

In these cases the hypothesis of borrowing breaks down, and still more does it break down over
the Algonkin deity Atahocan.

Father Le Jeune, S.J., went first among the Algonkins, a missionary pioneer, in 1633, and suffered
unspeakable things in his courageous endeavour to win souls in a most recalcitrant flock. He
writes (1633): "As this savage has given me occasion to speak of their god, I will remark that
it is a great error to think that the savages have no knowledge of any deity. I was surprised
to hear this in France. I do not know their secrets, but, from the little which I am about
to tell, it will be seen that they have such knowledge.

"They say that one exists whom they call Atahocan, who made the whole. Speaking of God in a
wigwam one day, they asked me 'what is God?' I told them that it was He who made all things,
Heaven and Earth. They then began to cry out to each other, 'Atahocan! Atahocan! it is Atahocan!'"

There could be no better evidence that Atahocan was NOT (as is often said) "borrowed from the
Jesuits". The Jesuits had only just arrived.

Later (1634) Le Jeune interrogated an old man and a partly Europeanised sorcerer. They replied
that nothing was certain; that Atahocan was only spoken of as "of a thing so remote," that
assurance was impossible. "In fact, their word Nitatohokan means, 'I fable, I tell an old story'."

Thus Atahocan, though at once recognised as identical with the Creator of the missionary, was
so far from being the latest thing in religious evolution that he had passed into a proverb
for the ancient and the fabulous. This, of course, is inconsistent with RECENT borrowing. He
was neglected for Khichikouai, spirits which inspire seers, and are of some practical use,
receiving rewards in offerings of grease, says Le Jeune.(1)

(1) Relations, 1633, 1634.

The obsolescent Atahocan seems to have had no moral activity. But, in America, this indolence
of God is not universal. The good attributes of Kiehtan and Ahone were not borrowed from Christianity,
were matter of Indian belief before the English arrived. It did so, as usual, in MYTHOLOGY,
but not in RELIGION. There is nothing ridiculous in what is known of Ahone and Kiehtan. If
they had a mythology, and if we knew the myths, doubtless they would be ridiculous enough.
The savage mind, turned from belief and awe into the spinning of yarns, instantly yields to
humorous fancy. As we know, mediaeval popular Christianity, in imagery, marchen or tales, and
art, copiously illustrates the same mental phenomenon. Saints, God, our Lord, and the Virgin,
all play ludicrous and immoral parts in Christian folk-tales. This is Mythology, and here is,
beyond all cavil, a late corruption of Religion. Here, where we know the history of a creed,
Religion is early, and these myths are late. Other examples of American divine ideas might
be given, such as the extraordinary hymns in which the Zunis address the Eternal, Ahonawilona.
But as the Zuni religion has only been studied in recent years, the hymns would be dismissed
as "borrowed," though there is nothing Catholic or Christian about them. We have preferred
to select examples where borrowing from Christianity is out of the question. The current anthropological
theory is thus confronted with American examples of ideas of the divine which cannot have been
borrowed, while, if the gods are said to have been evolved out of ghosts, we reply that, in
some cases, they receive no sacrifice, sacrifice being usually a note of ghostly descent. Again,
similar gods, as we show, exist where ghosts of chiefs are not worshipped, and as far as evidence
goes never were worshipped, because there is no evidence of the existence at any time of such
chiefs. The American highest gods may then be equally free from the taint of ghostly descent.

(1) Parkman, The Jesuits in North America. p. lxxviii.

There is another more or less moral North American deity whose evolution is rather questionable.
Pere Brebeuf (1636), speaking of the Hurons, says that "they have recourse to Heaven in almost
all their necessities,... and I may say that it is, in fact, God whom they blindly adore, for
they imagine that there is an Oki, that is, a demon, in heaven, who regulates the seasons,
bridles the winds and the waves of the sea, and helps them in every need. They dread his wrath,
and appeal to him as witness to the inviolability of their faith, when they make a promise
or treaty of peace with enemies. 'Heaven hear us to-day' is their form of adjuration."(1)

(1) Relations, 1636, pp. 106, 107.

A spiritual being, whose home is heaven, who rides on the winds, whose wrath is dreaded, who
sanctions the oath, is only called "a demon" by the prejudice of the worthy father who, at
the same time, admits that the savages have a conception of God--and that God, so conceived,
is this demon!

The debatable question is, was the "demon," or the actual expanse of sky, first in evolution?
That cannot precisely be settled, but in the analogous Chinese case of China we find heaven
(Tien) and "Shang-ti, the personal ruling Deity," corresponding to the Huron "demon". Shang-ti,
the personal deity, occurs most in the oldest, pre-Confucian sacred documents, and, so far,
appears to be the earlier conception. The "demon" in Huron faith may also be earlier than the
religious regard paid to his home, the sky.(1) The unborrowed antiquity of a belief in a divine
being, creative and sometimes moral, in North America, is thus demonstrated. So far I had written
when I accidentally fell in with Mr. Tylor's essay on "The Limits of Savage Religion".(2) In
that essay, rather to my surprise, Mr. Tylor argues for the borrowing of "The Great Spirit,"
"The Great Manitou," from the Jesuits. Now, as to the phrase, "Great Spirit," the Jesuits doubtless
caused its promulgation, and, where their teaching penetrated, shreds of their doctrine may
have adhered to the Indian conception of that divine being. But Mr. Tylor in his essay does
not allude to the early evidence, his own, for Oki, Atahocan, Kiehtan, and Torngursak, all
undeniably prior to Jesuit influence, and found where Jesuits, later, did not go. As Mr. Tylor
offers no reason for disregarding evidence in 1892 which he had republished in a new edition
of Primitive Culture in 1891, it is impossible to argue against him in this place. He went
on, in the essay cited (1892) to contend that the Australian god of the Kamilaroi of Victoria,
Baiame, is, in name and attributes, of missionary introduction. Happily this hypothesis can
be refuted, as we show in the following chapter on Australian gods.

(1) See Tylor, Prim. Cult., ii. 362, and Making of Religion, p. 318; also Menzies, History
of Religion, pp. 108,109, and Dr. Legge's Chinese Classics, in Sacred Books of the East, vols.
iii., xxvii., xxviii.

It would be easy enough to meet the hypothesis of borrowing in the case of the many African
tribes who possess something approaching to a rude monotheistic conception. Among these are
the Dinkas of the Upper Nile, with their neighbours, whose creed Russegger compares to that
of modern Deists in Europe. The Dinka god, Dendid, is omnipotent, but so benevolent that he
is not addressed in prayer, nor propitiated by sacrifice. Compare the supreme being of the
Caribs, beneficent, otiose, unadored.(1) A similar deity, veiled in the instruction of the
as yet unpenetrated Mysteries, exists among the Yao of Central Africa.(2) Of the negro race,
Waitz says, "even if we do not call them monotheists, we may still think of them as standing
on the boundary of monotheism despite their innumerable rude superstitions".(3) The Tshi speaking
people of the Gold Coast have their unworshipped Nyankupon, a now otiose unadored being, with
a magisterial deputy, worshipped with many sacrifices. The case is almost an exact parallel
to that of Ahone and Oki in America. THESE were not borrowed, and the author has argued at
length against Major Ellis's theory of the borrowing from Christians of Nyankupon.(4)

To conclude this chapter, the study of savage and barbaric religions seems to yield the following
facts:--

1. Low savages. No regular chiefs. Great beings, not in receipt of sacrifice, sanctioning morality.
Ghosts are not worshipped, though believed in. Polytheism, departmental gods and gods of heaven,
earth, sky and so forth, have not been developed or are not found.

2. Barbaric races. Aristocratic or monarchic. Ghosts are worshipped and receive sacrifice.
Polytheistic gods are in renown and receive sacrifice. There is usually a supreme Maker who
is, in some cases, moral, in others otiose. In only one or two known cases (as in that of the
Polynesian Taaroa) is he in receipt of sacrifice.

3. Barbaric races. (Zulus, monarchic with Unkulunkulu; some Algonquins (feebly aristocratic)
with Atahocan). Religion is mainly ancestor worship or vague spirit worship; ghosts are propitiated
with food. There are traces of an original divine being whose name is becoming obsolescent
and a matter of jest.

4. Early civilisations. Monarchic or aristocratic. (Greece, Egypt, India, Peru, Mexico.) Polytheism.
One god tends to be supreme. Religiously regarded, gods are moral; in myth are the reverse.
Gods are in receipt of sacrifice. Heavenly society is modelled on that of men, monarchic or
aristocratic. Philosophic thought tends towards belief in one pure god, who may be named Zeus,
in Greece.

5. The religion of Israel. Probably a revival and purification of the old conception of a moral,
beneficent creator, whose creed had been involved in sacrifice and anthropomorphic myth.

In all the stages thus roughly sketched, myths of the lowest sort prevail, except in the records
of the last stage, where the documents have been edited by earnest monotheists.

If this theory be approximately correct, man's earliest religious ideas may very well have
consisted, in a sense, of dependence on a supreme moral being who, when attempts were made
by savages to describe the modus of his working, became involved in the fancies of mythology.
How this belief in such a being arose we have no evidence to prove. We make no hint at a sensus
numinis, or direct revelation.

While offering no hypothesis of the origin of belief in a moral creator we may present a suggestion.
Man himself made plenty of things, and could probably conceive of a being who made the world
and the objects in it. "Certainly there must be some Being who made all these things. He must
be very good too," said an Eskimo to a missionary.(2) The goodness is inferred by the Eskimo
from his own contentment with "the things which are made".(3)

(1) Darwin, Descent of Man, i. p. 66.

(2) Cranz, i. 199.

(3) Romans, i. 19.

Another example of barbaric man "seeking after God" may be adduced.

What the Greenlander said is corroborated by what a Kaffir said. Kaffir religion is mainly
animistic, ancestral spirits receive food and sacrifice--there is but an evanescent tradition
of a "Lord in Heaven". Thus a very respectable Kaffir said to M. Arbrousset, "your tidings
(Christianity) are what I want; and I was seeking before I knew you.... I asked myself sorrowful
questions. 'Who has touched the stars with his hands?... Who makes the waters flow?... Who
can have given earth the wisdom and power to produce corn?' Then I buried my face in my hands."

"This," says Sir John Lubbock, "was, however, an exceptional case. As a general rule savages
do not set themselves to think out such questions."(1)

(1) Origin of Civilisation, p. 201.

As a common fact, if savages never ask the question, at all events, somehow, they have the
answer ready made. "Mangarrah, or Baiame, Puluga, or Dendid, or Ahone, or Ahonawilona, or Atahocan,
or Taaroa, or Tui Laga, was the maker." Therefore savages who know that leave the question
alone, or add mythical accretions. But their ancestors must have asked the question, like the
"very respectable Kaffir" before they answered it.

Having reached the idea of a Creator, it was not difficult to add that he was "good," or beneficent,
and was deathless.

A notion of a good powerful Maker, not subject to death because necessarily prior to Death
(who only invaded the world late), seems easier of attainment than the notion of Spirit which,
ex hypothesi, demands much delicate psychological study and hard thought. The idea of a Good
Maker, once reached, becomes, perhaps, the germ of future theism, but, as Mr. Darwin says,
the human mind was "infallibly led to various strange superstitions". As St. Paul says, in
perfect agreement with Mr. Darwin on this point, "they became vain in their imaginations, and
their foolish heart was darkened".

Among other imaginations (right or wrong) was the belief in spirits, with all that followed
in the way of instituting sacrifices, even of human beings, and of dropping morality, about
which the ghost of a deceased medicine-man was not likely to be much interested. The supposed
nearness to man, and the venal and partial character of worshipped gods and ghost-gods, would
inevitably win for them more service and attention than would be paid to a Maker remote, unbought
and impartial. Hence the conception of such a Being would tend to obsolescence, as we see that
it does, and would be most obscured where ghosts were most propitiated, as among the Zulus.
Later philosophy would attach the spiritual conception to the revived or newly discovered idea
of the supreme God.

In all this speculation there is nothing mystical; no supernatural or supernormal interference
is postulated. Supernormal experiences may have helped to originate or support the belief in
spirits, that, however, is another question. But this hypothesis of the origin of belief in
a good unceasing Maker of things is, of course, confessedly a conjecture, for which historical
evidence cannot be given, in the nature of the case. All our attempts to discover origins far
behind history must be conjectural. Their value must be estimated by the extent to which this
or that hypothesis colligates the facts. Now our hypothesis does colligate the facts. It shows
how belief in a moral supreme being might arise before ghosts were worshipped, and it accounts
for the flaw in the religious strata, for the mythical accretions, for the otiose Creator in
the background of many barbaric religions, and for the almost universal absence of sacrifice
to the God relatively supreme. He was, from his earliest conception, in no need of gifts from men.

On this matter of otiose supreme gods, Professor Menzies writes, "It is very common to find
in savage beliefs a vague far-off god, who is at the back of all the others, takes little part
in the management of things, and receives little worship. But it is impossible to judge what
that being was at an earlier time; he may have been a nature god, or a spirit who has by degrees
grown faint, and come to occupy this position."

Now the position which he occupies is usually, if not universally, that of the Creator. He
could not arrive at this rank by "becoming faint," nor could "a nature-god" be the Maker of
Nature. The only way by which we can discover "what that being was at an earlier time" is to
see what he IS at an earlier time, that is to say, what the conception of him is, among men
in an earlier state of culture. Among them, as we show, he is very much more near, potent and
moral, than among races more advanced in social evolution and material culture. We can form
no opinion as to the nature of such "vague, far-off gods, at the back of all the others," till
we collect and compare examples, and endeavour to ascertain what points they have in common,
and in what points they differ from each other. It then becomes plain that they are least far
away, and most potent, where there is least ghostly and polytheistic competition, that is,
among the most backward races. The more animism the less theism, is the general rule. Manifestly
the current hypothesis--that all religion is animistic in origin--does not account for these
facts, and is obliged to fly to an undemonstrated theory of degradation, or to an undemonstrated
theory of borrowing. That our theory is inconsistent with the general doctrine of evolution
we cannot admit, if we are allowed to agree with Mr. Darwin's statement about the high mental
faculties which first led man to sympathetic, and then to wild beliefs. We do not pretend to
be more Darwinian than Mr. Darwin, who compares "these miserable and indirect results of our
higher faculties" to "the occasional mistakes of the instincts of the lower animals".

The opinion here maintained, namely, that a germ of pure belief may be detected amidst the
confusion of low savage faith, and that in a still earlier stage it may have been less overlaid
with fable, is in direct contradiction to current theories. It is also in contradiction with
the opinions entertained by myself before I made an independent examination of the evidence.
Like others, I was inclined to regard reports of a moral Creator, who observes conduct, and
judges it even in the next life, as rumours due either to Christian influence, or to mistake.
I well know, however, and could, and did, discount the sources of error. I was on my guard
against the twin fallacies of describing all savage religion as "devil worship," and of expecting
to find a primitive "divine tradition". I was also on my guard against the modern bias derived
from the "ghost-theory," and Mr. Spencer's works, and I kept an eye on opportunities of "borrowing".(1)
I had, in fact, classified all known idola in the first edition of this work, such as the fallacy
of leading questions and the chance of deliberate deception. I sought the earliest evidence,
prior to any missionary teaching, and the evidence of what the first missionaries found, in
the way of belief, on their arrival. I preferred the testimony of the best educated observers,
and of those most familiar with native languages. I sought for evidence in native hymns (Maori,
Zuni, Dinka, Red Indian) and in native ceremonial and mystery, as these sources were least
likely to be contaminated.

(1) Making of Religion, p. 187.

On the other side, I found a vast body of testimony that savages had no religion at all. But
that testimony, en masse, was refuted by Roskoff, and also, in places, by Tylor. When three
witnesses were brought to swear that they saw the Irishman commit a crime, he offered to bring
a dozen witnesses who did NOT see him. Negative evidence of squatters, sailors and colonists,
who did NOT see any religion among this or that race, is not worth much against evidence of
trained observers and linguists who DID find what the others missed, and who found more the
more they knew the tribe in question. Again, like others, I thought savages incapable of such
relatively pure ideas as I now believe some of them to possess. But I could not resist the
evidence, and I abandoned my a priori notions. The evidence forcibly attests gradations in
the central belief. It is found in various shades, from relative potency down to a vanishing
trace, and it is found in significant proportion to the prevalence of animistic ideas, being
weakest where they are most developed, strongest where they are least developed. There must
be a reason for these phenomena, and that reason, as it seems to me, is the overlaying and
supersession of a rudely Theistic by an animistic creed. That one cause would explain, and
does colligate, all the facts.

There remains a point on which misconception proves to be possible. It will be shown, contrary
to the current hypothesis, that the religion of the lowest races, in its highest form, sanctions
morality. That morality, again, in certain instances, demands unselfishness. Of course we are
not claiming for that doctrine any supernatural origin. Religion, if it sanctions ethics at
all, will sanction those which the conscience accepts, and those ethics, in one way or other,
must have been evolved. That the "cosmical" law is "the weakest must go to the wall" is generally
conceded. Man, however, is found trying to reverse the law, by equal and friendly dealing (at
least within what is vaguely called "the tribe"). His religion, as in Australia, will be shown
to insist on this unselfishness. How did he evolve his ethics? This conduct reverses the cosmical
process, and notoriously civilised society, Christian society, does not act on these principles.
Neither do the savages, who knock the old and feeble on the head, or deliberately leave them
to starve, act on these principles, sanctioned by Australian religion, but (according to Mr.
Dawson) NOT carried out in Australian practice. "When old people become infirm... it is lawful
and customary to kill them."(1)

(1) Australian Aborigines, p. 62.

As to the point of unselfishness, evolutionists are apt to account for it by common interest.
A tribe in which the strongest monopolise what is best will not survive so well as an unselfish
tribe in the struggle for existence. But precisely the opposite is true, aristocracy marks
the more successful barbaric races, and an aristocratic slave-holding tribe could have swept
Australia as the Zulus swept South Africa. That aristocracy and acquisition of separate property
are steps in advance on communistic savagery all history declares. Therefore a tribe which
in Australia developed private property, and reduced its neighbours to slavery, would have
been better fitted to survive than such a tribe as Dampier describes.

This is so evident that probably, or possibly, the Dampier state of society was not developed
in obedience to a recognised tribal interest, but in obedience to an affectionate instinct.
"Ils s'entr' aiment les une les autres," says Brebeuf of the Hurons.(1) "I never heard the
women complain of being left out of feasts, or that the men ate the best portions... every
one does his business sweetly, peaceably, without dispute. You never see disputes, quarrels,
hatred, or reproach among them." Brebeuf then tells how a young Indian stranger, in a time
of want, stole the best part of a moose. "They did not rage or curse, they only bantered him,
and yet to take our meat was almost to take our lives." Brebeuf wanted to lecture the lad;
his Indian host bade him hold his peace, and the stranger was given hospitality, with his wife
and children. "They are very generous, and make it a point not to attach themselves to the
goods of this world." "Their greatest reproach is 'that man wants everything, he is greedy'.
They support, with never a murmur, widows, orphans and old men, yet they kill hopeless or troublesome
invalids, and their whole conduct to Europeans was the reverse of their domestic behaviour."

(1) Relations, 1634, p. 29.

Another example of savage unselfish ethics may be found in Mr. Mann's account of the Andaman
Islanders, a nomad race, very low in culture. "It is a noteworthy trait, and one which deserves
high commendation, that every care and consideration are paid by all classes to the very young,
the weak, the aged, and the helpless, and these being made special objects of interest and
attention, invariably fare better in regard to the comforts and necessaries of daily life than
any of the otherwise more fortunate members of the community."(1)

(1) J. A. I., xii. p. 93.

Mr. Huxley, in his celebrated Romanes Lecture on "Evolution and Morality," laid stress on man's
contravention of the cosmic law, "the weakest must go to the wall". He did not explain the
evolution of man's opposition to this law. The ordinary evolutionist hypothesis, that the tribe
would prosper most whose members were least self-seeking, is contradicted by all history. The
overbearing, "grabbing," aristocratic, individualistic, unscrupulous races beat the others
out of the field. Mr. Huxley, indeed, alleged that the "influence of the cosmic process in
the evolution of society is the greater the more rudimentary its civilisation. We have still
to face the problem of the generosity of low savages.

(1) Ethics of Evolution, pp. 81-84.

It is conceivable that the higher ethics of low savages rather reflect their emotional instincts
than arise from tribal legislation which is supposed to enable a "tribe" to prosper in the
struggle for existence. As Brebeuf and Dampier, among others, prove, savages often set a good
example to Christians, and their ethics are, in certain cases, as among the Andamanese and
Fuegians, and, probably among the Yao, sanctioned by their religion. But, as Mr. Tylor says,
"the better savage social life seems but in unstable equilibrium, liable to be easily upset
by a touch of distress, temptation, or violence".(1) Still, religion does its best, in certain
cases, to lend equilibrium; though all the world over, religion often fails in practice.
