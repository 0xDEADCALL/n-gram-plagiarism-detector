CIVIL SURGEONS TEMPORARILY ATTACHED TO THAT CORPS

These Experiences are Dedicated

AS AN EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION OF THE INVARIABLE KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY EXTENDED TO THE AUTHOR
WITHOUT WHICH THE BOOK COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN

PREFACE

A word of explanation is perhaps necessary as to the form in which these experiences have been
put together. The matter was originally collected with the object of sending a series of articles
to the British Medical Journal. Various circumstances, however, of which the chief was the
feeling that extending experience altered in many cases the views adopted at first sight, prevented
the original intention from being carried into execution, and the articles, considerably expanded,
are now published together.

As to the illustrative cases introduced in support of various statements made in the text,
only those have been chosen from my notes which were under my own observation for a considerable
time, and many of these have been brought up to date since my return to England. I have, as
a rule, avoided the inclusion of cases seen cursorily, and few simple ones have been quoted
since their character is sufficiently indicated in the text. These remarks seem necessary since
the mode of selection has resulted in the inclusion of a number of cases of exceptional severity,
and any attempt to draw statistical conclusions from them would be most misleading.

The first two chapters have been added with a view to affording some information, first, as
to the conditions under which a great part of the surgical work was done, and, secondly, as
to the mechanism and causation of the injuries, which would not readily be at hand in the case
of the general surgical reader. For much of the information contained in Chapter II. I must
express my indebtedness to the work of MM. Nimier and Laval, so frequently quoted.

The only other object of this Preface is to express my thanks to the many who have aided me
in the task of amplifying the observations on which the articles are founded, and I think no
writer ever received more sympathetic and kindly help in such particulars than the author.

My first thanks, those due to the Members of the Royal Army Medical Corps, I endeavour to express
by the dedication of this volume. Any attempt to make individual acknowledgment to either the
Members of the Service, or to the Civil Surgeons temporarily attached, would be impossible.
I have, however, tried to associate the names of many of those in charge of cases in the recital
of histories and treatment throughout.

My thanks are not less due to the Military Heads of Departments at the War Office, who have
helped me in the collection of details as to the subsequent course of many of the cases described,
and in the acquisition of information regarding the weapons and ammunition treated of. I should
particularly express my gratitude to Colonel Robb, of the Adjutant-General's Department, and
Colonel Montgomery, of the Ordnance Department.

I am greatly indebted to my former colleague Mr. Cheatle for two of the illustrations of wounds,
and for permission to quote some of his other experience, and to Mr. Henry Catling, to whose
skill I owe the majority of the skiagrams of the fractures under my observation at Wynberg
and elsewhere.

I must also express my thanks to Mr. Danielsson and his artist, Mr. Ford, for the trouble they
have taken in converting my rough sketches into the illustrations contained in the volume.

Lastly, my warmest gratitude is due to my friends, Mr. Cuthbert Wallace, who has read some
of my chapters, and to Mr. F. C. Abbott, who has read the whole book for the press and suggested
many improvements and modifications.

SURGICAL EXPERIENCES

IN

SOUTH AFRICA

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTORY

The following pages are intended to give an account of personal experience of the gunshot wounds
observed during the South African campaign in 1899 and 1900. For this reason few cases are
quoted beyond those coming under my own immediate observation, and in the few instances where
others are made use of the source of quotation is indicated. It will be noted that my experience
was almost entirely confined to bullet wounds, and in this respect it no doubt differs from
that of surgeons employed in Natal, where shell injuries were more numerous. This is, however,
of the less moment for my purpose as there is probably little to add regarding shell injuries
to what is already known, while, on the other hand, the opportunity of observing large numbers
of injuries from rifle bullets of small calibre has not previously been afforded to British
surgeons.

I think the general trend of the observations goes to show that the employment of bullets of
small calibre is all to the advantage of the men wounded, except in so far as the increased
possibilities of the range of fire may augment the number of individuals hit; also that such
variations as exist between wounds inflicted by bullets of the Martini-Henry and Mauser types
respectively, depend rather on the form and bulk of the projectile than on any inherent difference
in the nature of the injuries. Thus in the chapter devoted to the general characters of the
wounds, it will be seen that most of the older types of entry and exit aperture are produced
in miniature by the small modern bullet, and that the main peculiarity of the deeper injuries
is the frequent strict localisation of the direct damage to an area of no greater width than
that crossed by narrow structures of importance such as arteries or nerves.

It is to be regretted that I am unable to furnish any important statistical details, but incomplete
numbers, such as are at my disposal, would be of little value. In view, however, of the considerable
interval which must elapse before the Royal Army Medical Corps is able to arrange and publish
the large material which will have accumulated, it has seemed unwise to defer publication until
the completion of a report which will deal with such matters thoroughly.

It may be of interest to premise the opportunities which I enjoyed of gaining experience during
the campaign. I arrived in South Africa on November 19, 1899; two days later I proceeded to
Orange River with Surgeon-General Wilson, and on the day three weeks after leaving home performed
some operations in the field hospitals on patients from the battle of Belmont. I remained at
Orange River during the three next engagements, Graspan, Enslin, and Modder River, and on the
day of Magersfontein I went forward to the Field hospitals at Modder River, arriving during
the bringing in of the patients from the field of battle. I returned to Orange River with the
patients and remained there a further period of three weeks, during which time the patients
were gradually transferred to the Base hospitals at Wynberg. At Christmas I followed the patients
down to the base, and thus was able to observe the course of the cases from their commencement
to convalescence. I remained at Wynberg six weeks, during which time a number of cases from
the neighbourhood of Rensburg and some from Natal were received. On February 7, I left Wynberg,
following Lord Roberts up to my old quarters at Modder River, where I saw a few wounded men
brought in from the engagements at Koodoosberg Drift. On Lord Roberts's departure for Bloemfontein
he requested me to return to Wynberg to await the wounded who might be sent down from the fighting
which might occur during his advance. I therefore had the disappointment of seeing the start
of the army, and then returning to Wynberg, where I remained for another six weeks in attendance
at Nos. 1 and 2 General Hospitals.

During this period a very large number of the wounded from Paardeberg Drift and other battles
were sent down and treated, after which surgical work began to flag.

On April 14, I was recalled to the front and journeyed to Bloemfontein, where I stayed three
weeks, making one journey out to the Bearer Company of the IX. Division at the Waterworks.

On May 4, I left Bloemfontein with Lord Roberts's army, and shortly after joined the IX. Division,
with which I journeyed until the commencement of June, seeing a good deal of scattered work
in the field and Field hospitals, and in the small temporary improvised hospitals in the towns
of Winberg, Lindley, and Heilbron. Early in June I left Heilbron with Lord Methuen's division,
and spent the next four weeks with this division in the field. Thence I journeyed to Pretoria
and Johannesburg, seeing a small number of wounded in each town, and on July 10, with Lord
Roberts's consent, I started for home, visiting a number of the hospitals in the Orange River
Colony and Natal on my way down to Cape Town. During the movements briefly recorded above,
which absorbed a period of nine months, my time was fairly evenly divided between Field, Stationary,
and Base hospitals; hence I had opportunities of observing the patients in every stage of their
illnesses, and in all some thousands of men came under my notice.

My departure for the seat of war was rather hurried, hence my surgical equipment was not of
an extensive nature. It may be of interest, however, to shortly recount what it consisted in,
since it proved an ample one, and yet was carried in a small satchel. The plan of selection
adopted consisted in carefully going through the equipment of the British Field Hospital, and
then adding such other instruments as seemed to me likely to be useful. With few exceptions,
therefore, designed to meet emergencies, my set of instruments formed a supplement to the actual
necessities carried by the Service hospitals, and was as follows:--4 trephines, Horsley's elevator,
brain knife and seeker. 2 pairs of Hoffman's and 1 pair of Lane's fulcrum gouge forceps, 3
bone gouges, 1 pair straight 1 curved necrosis forceps, 1 pair bone forceps. 1 Wood's 1 Horsley's
skull saws, 18 Gigli's saws with an extra handle, and two Podrez' directors for the same. 1
set Lane's bone drills, broaches, screw-drivers, and counter-sink with eight ounces of screws:
silver patella wire, and 1 pair Peter's bone forceps. 2 aneurism needles, 1 bullet probe, 1
pair Egyptian Army pattern bullet forceps. 4 Lane's and 3 pairs Makins's bowel clamps, Nos.
3 4 and 5 Laplace's bowel forceps, 6 Murphy's buttons, 1 pair Morris's retractors, 6 dozen
intestine needles, 2 Macphail's needle-holders, Nos. 4 5 6 Thomas's slot-eyed needles, 1 mouth
gag, 1 Durham's double raspatory, 3 strong plated raspatories, 1 pair tongue forceps, 1 tracheal
dilator, 1 pair hernia needles, 1 hernia and 1 ordinary steel director, 1 transfusion set with
metal funnel, and a stock of Messrs. Burroughes and Wellcome's compound saline infusion soloids.
1 antitoxin syringe. 6 scalpels, 2 blunt-pointed curved bistouries, 6 forcipressure forceps,
1 pair Jordan Lloyd's retractors, 1 pair ordinary retractors, 2 pairs of forceps, 3 pairs of
Scissors, 1 skin-grafting razor and roll of perforated tin foil, 1 metal pocket case, and 1
hypodermic syringe with tabloids. A stock of silkworm gut, horsehair and silk ligatures, the
latter prepared and sterilised for me by Miss Taylor, the Theatre Sister at St. Thomas's Hospital.
Some pairs of McBurney's india-rubber, and cotton-thread operating gloves.

The instruments were packed in sets in small linen holdalls suggested and made by Messrs. Down
Bros., who also devised my satchel. In the light of the experience gained I should have preferred
a tin case to the satchel, as it never needed to be carried on horseback.

For dressings I trusted entirely to the Royal Army Medical Corps, and at my request Colonel
Gubbins, R.A.M.C., sent out to the Cape a quantity of sterilised sponges and pads made by Messrs.
Robinson & Co. Ltd. of Chesterfield, which fully met all requirements in this direction.

This equipment was superfluous at the Base hospitals, but when in the field with the troops
proved very useful. In the early part of the campaign I was able to do all my travelling by
train, but later I travelled by road only. I received the greatest kindness and help in this
particular. General Sir William Nicholson, Chief Director of Transport, provided me with a
buggy, a pair of horses, and a driver, and Prince Francis of Teck, the Chief Remount Officer,
selected a pony suitable to my equestrian powers. The buggy proved a very great success; the
box seat carried my instruments and dressings, the front a 4-gallon tin water-bottle for emergency
operations, and the rear shelf my personal belongings. The water-bottle was lent to me by the
Portland Hospital. (Fig. 3.)

The cart was able to cross any drifts or dongas, and when an engagement was in progress was
able to accompany the Ambulance wagons, so that I had all my necessaries on the spot, even
at the first dressing station. In point of fact when with the Highland Brigade, on some occasions,
we did all necessary operations on the spot during the progress of fighting; a most useful
performance, since fighting on several days did not cease till dark, and the evenings were
much too cold to allow of operations being done with safety to the patients. The great advantage
of the buggy was its lightness and smallness. On one occasion it accompanied me between 500
and 600 miles without a single accident, beyond the fact that one night I was relieved of both
my horses by some troopers whose own were worn out.

With regard to the general health of the troops as subjects of surgical wounds, I suppose a
better class of patient could scarcely be found. The men were young, sound, well set and nourished,
and hard and fit from exercise in the open air. Beyond this, in spite of the scarcity of vegetables,
a certain amount of fruit, rations of jam, and lime juice made any sign of scurvy a rare occurrence--I
never saw a case during the whole of my wanderings. The meat was good, especially in the early
part of the campaign, when it was for the most part brought from Australia and New Zealand,
and we enjoyed the two collateral advantages of getting plenty of the ice which had been used
for the preservation of the meat, in the camps, and the still greater one of having no butchers'
offal to need destruction or prove a source of danger. When bread was to be got it was fairly
good, and the biscuit was at all times excellent. Except on the advance from Modder River to
Bloemfontein, as far as I could judge, no large bodies of the men ever really suffered from
shortness of food, and then only for a few days. Drink was a more serious problem: in the early
days beer was to be got at the canteens, but with the increase of numbers and difficulties
of transport this ceased to be the case, and water was the sole fluid available. This was often
muddy, and the soldiers would take very little care what they drank unless under constant supervision;
hence a great quantity of very undesirable water was drunk. None the less I think the water
was more often the cause of sand diarrhoea than of enteric fever. A large quantity of fluid
was by no means a necessity if the men would only have exercised some self-control. During
the first week I spent at Orange River, I drank lime juice and water all day, but after that
time, by a very slight amount of determination, I thoroughly broke myself of the habit, and
drank at meal-times only. Most of the men however emptied their water-bottles during the first
hour of the march, and the rest of the day endured agony, seizing the first opportunity of
drinking any filthy water they met with. When, for instance, we camped near a vlei, and the
General took the greatest care that the mules and horses should be watered at one spot only,
in order to preserve the cleanliness of the rest of the pool, the men would often go and fill
their water-bottles amongst the animals' feet rather than take the trouble to walk the few
necessary yards round. In such particulars they needed constant supervision.

The climate on the western side was a great element no doubt both in the general healthiness
of the men and in the general good results seen in the healing of wounds. The days were often
hot; thus even in November at Orange River the thermometer registered 115°F. in the single
bell tents, but on the other hand the nights were cool and refreshing. The air was very pure
and exceedingly dry, while the constant sunshine not only kept up the spirits, but also proved
the most efficient disinfector of any ground fouled to less than a serious extent. Dust was
our principal bugbear; and when a camp had been settled for a few days, flies; both of these
evils increasing rapidly as the stay on any one spot was prolonged. My personal experience
of rain was small, but I was twice in camp, once at Orange River and once at Bloemfontein,
when very heavy rain fell, and this was sufficient to make the camps terribly uncomfortable
for a few days.

Under these conditions, as might be expected, until the outbreak of enteric fever the health
of the men was remarkably good, minor ailments alone prevailing. One of the most troublesome
of these was diarrhoea, which gained the appellation of 'the Modders,' already a classical
name as far as South Africa is concerned. This most frequently, I think, depended on errors
of diet, combined with the swallowing of a large amount of sand with the food as dust, and
in the water drunk. Cases of severe dysentery, however, were also not very uncommon. Rheumatic
pains were a common ailment, which, considering the dryness of the atmosphere, would hardly
have been expected. Continued fever of a somewhat special type was not uncommon, and was sometimes
spoken of under the name of the district, sometimes as veldt fever--of this I will say nothing,
as others better fitted to point out its peculiarities will no doubt deal with it. Enteric
fever, our chief scourge, I will pass over for the same reason. I might, however, remark from
the point of view of one not very experienced in this disease, that in a large number of the
fatal cases I happened to see, the actual cause of death seemed to me to be septicæmia from
absorption from the mouth. The mouths were unusually bad, even allowing for the often insufficient
cleansing that was able to be carried out, and I was inclined to attribute these in some degree
to the dryness of the atmosphere, which very quickly and effectively dried up the mucous membrane
of the mouth in patients not breathing through the nose, and encouraged the formation of large
cracks. Pneumonia was rare, and this was rendered the more striking from the comparatively
large number of men who contracted the disease on board ship on the voyage out from England.

As will be gathered from the above, medical disease seldom called for the aid of the surgeon.
Abdominal section was occasionally considered in cases of perforation in enteric fever, and
was, I believe, a few times performed, but as far as I know without success. It was also proposed
to treat some of the severe dysentery cases by colotomy, but I never saw the method tried.
As far as I was concerned I never met with a case of either disease I thought suitable for
the treatment. I saw one case in which an abscess of the liver had followed an attack of enteric,
which had been successfully treated by incision, and a few cases of tropical abscess which
probably came into the country were also subjected to operation. Some cases of appendicitis,
as would be expected, also needed surgical treatment. In a few instances empyema followed influenza,
and a few cases of mastoid suppuration had to be dealt with.

Of surgical diseases the one most special to the campaign, although not of great importance,
was the veldt sore. This was a small localised suppuration most common on the hands and neck,
but sometimes invading the whole trunk, more particularly the lower extremities however, when
the covered parts of the body were attacked. The sores were no doubt the result of local infections;
they reminded me most of the sores seen on the hands of plasterers, and I think there is no
doubt the dust was responsible for them. I think piles were somewhat more prevalent than they
should have been among the men, but this was probably dependent on the strain involved in defæcation
in the squatting position, since the soldiers were for the most part regularly attentive to
the calls of nature.

I saw a good many cases of lightning stroke, and some were fatal. Sunstroke was not common,
and, considering the heat, it was very remarkable how little the men suffered from this condition.
This was no doubt in part attributable to the absence of the possibility of getting alcoholic
drinks, but it is not common for any one in South Africa to suffer in this way, probably as
a result of the continuous nature of the sunshine.

In spite of the labours of hospital surgeons at home, it was rather instructive to see the
number of men who suffered with hernia, varicocele, and varicose veins to a sufficient degree
to necessitate going to the base. The experience quite sufficed to explain the trouble which
is taken to prevent men with these complaints entering the service.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION OF THE NUMBER OF MEN KILLED AND WOUNDED

I will now pass to the question of the proportionate frequency with which the men were killed
or wounded during the present campaign. I propose to take only one series of battles, with
which I was personally acquainted throughout, to illustrate this point. This seems the more
satisfactory course to follow, since the number of casualties is still undergoing continuous
gradual increase, and besides this the warfare has assumed a peculiar and irregular form, statistics
from which scarcely possess general application.

The battles included, those of the first Kimberley Relief Force, were fought under fair average
conditions as to the nature of the ground. In the first two the defending enemy occupied heights,
in the two following the ground advanced over by our men was comparatively even; thus at Modder
River there was only a gradual slope upwards, and at Magersfontein the advanced trenches of
the Boers were only slightly above the level of the ground over which the advance was made.
At the same time, at the latter battle a great number of the Boers engaged were on the sides
of the hill well above the advanced trenches. In no case were the Boers in such a position
as to have to fire upwards, to them a considerable advantage. It must also be noted that throughout
the Boers were able to rest their rifles; hence the fire should have been at any rate of an
average degree of accuracy. In the advances of our own men, anthills and stones were practically
the only cover to be obtained, and little or no help was given by variations in the general
surface. All these points seem to favour a large proportional number of hits on the part of
the riflemen. I very much regret that I am unable to say what was the proportional number of
shell wounds among the men hit, but I can say with some confidence that among the wounded it
was not as great as ten per cent. I should be inclined to place it as low as five per cent.
Again, I cannot fix the proportionate occurrence of wounds from bullets of large calibre such
as the Martini-Henry, but this was certainly not large. I think if ten per cent. is deducted
to represent the number of hits from either of these forms of projectile, that we may fairly
assume the remaining 90 per cent. of the wounds to have been produced by bullets of small calibre.
The numbers of the opposing forces were probably fairly even.

Taking all these circumstances together, and bearing in mind that our army was always in the
position of having to make frontal attacks on men well protected in strong positions, I think
it must be allowed that a fair idea should be possible of the effectiveness of the modern weapons.
Only one circumstance, one inseparable from any fighting with the Boers, seems to affect the
numbers in an important manner. This consists in the fact that the Boer rarely fights to the
bitter end, hence the greater proportion of his hits are obtained at long distances.

Table I. gives the number of men engaged, and also that of the killed and wounded at each of
four battles. Table III. shows for comparison the relative number of killed and wounded in
some former campaigns while older forms of weapon were in use.

With regard to the numbers in Tables I. and II. it should be at once said that they are only
to be regarded as approximate, since they do not exactly tally with those officially reported
in the 'Times' at a later date. Sources of error may, however, have crept into both, and as
there is little difference in the gross numbers, I have preferred to retain the series compiled
by Major Burtchaell, R.A.M.C., as Table II. contains interesting information as to the proportionate
number of men who died during the first 48 hours, after being wounded.

The high death rate among the officers will at once arrest attention, but this has been noticed
in other campaigns, particularly in the Franco-German war. It is mainly attributable to the
circumstance that the officers, as leading, are always in the front and most exposed position.
I much doubt whether at the end of the campaign the entire abandonment of distinctive badges
will be found to have had any very important result in decreasing the relative number of casualties
as between officers and men. At close quarters distinctive uniform is no doubt a danger, but
at the common ranges of 1,000 yards and upwards the enemy's fire is rather directed to cover
a zone than to pick out individuals.

The especially high mortality among the officers at the battle of Graspan was attributable
to the casualties among the naval officers, and the men of the brigade suffered most severely also.

It will be noted that the most expensive battles were those of Belmont and Magersfontein.

If the numbers of the men actually taking part in the fighting in these battles as given in
Table I. are massed, we get an approximate total of 12,420.[3]

Of this number, 1,959 or 15.06 per cent. were reported as killed, wounded, or missing. Thus:
killed, 315 or 2.53 per cent.; wounded, 1,512 or 12.17 per cent.; missing, 132 or 1.06 per
cent. Reference to Table III. shows that these percentages almost exactly correspond with those
obtaining in the entire Crimean campaign, and are greater than those observed in the German
army during the entire Franco-German campaign.

The mortality statistics given in Table II. are of great interest, since to those dying on
the field are added all men dying within the first 48 hours in the Field hospitals. From the
surgical point of view these men all received mortal injury, and are therefore properly included
among the fatalities. Their inclusion, moreover, makes an appreciable difference in the percentage
proportion of mortal injuries to wounds. Thus, if the numbers are massed (omitting the 'missing'),
we find that in the four battles 1,827 men were hit, of whom 315, or 17.24 per cent., were
killed. Among the wounded carried off the field, however, 49 received mortal injuries, and
if these are added to the 315, we find that the proportion of mortal injuries reaches 19.92
per cent.

The proportion of men killed to those wounded was as follows: killed 315, wounded 1,512, or
1 to 4.8. If we add to the men killed on the field of battle the 49 dying in the next 48 hours,
the proportion of fatalities is increased to 1 to 4.15. The higher of these proportions is
certainly the surgically correct one.

With regard to the general accuracy of the numbers given above, a comparison of those published
for the campaign up to September 15, 1900, is of value, as the two series substantially tally.
Thus, up to that date, 17,072 men were hit, and of these 2,998 were killed. The proportion
killed to wounded was therefore 1 to 4.69.

If it be borne in mind that of the wounded men included in Table I., 1.5 per cent. died later
in the Base hospitals, the percentages are almost identical.

Table III. is inserted with a view to instituting a comparison between the number of casualties
in the present and earlier campaigns.

For the purposes of this table it is necessary to take the approximate number of men at Lord
Methuen's disposal, irrespective of their active participation in the fighting.

The result of this addition to the total is to show that the percentage of men killed and wounded
was slightly lower than in the Crimean war, and nearly corresponded with that observed in the
Franco-German campaign.

As it has been shown that our numbers correspond in general with those of the whole war up
to September 15, 1900, there can be little doubt that the same ratios will be maintained to
the close of the campaign.

On the face of the numbers, therefore, there is little ground for assuming that the change
in the nature of the weapons has materially influenced the deadliness of warfare at all. This
is capable of explanation on the ground that in the Crimea the battles were fought at much
closer quarters, and hence the weapons of the time were as effective, or more so, than the
present ones. That this increased distance between the combatants will always counterbalance
the increased deadliness of the weapons in the future is more than probable, since the range
of effectiveness has been increased both in rifle and in artillery fire. In the present campaign
the effect of the latter was very noticeable, since the Boers were, as a rule, quickly displaced
by shell fire, unless they were in especially favourable positions, and this although no great
number of men was hit by the projectiles. Under these circumstances, except on some occasions,
neither side derived all the advantage from the increased shooting powers of their rifles which
might have been expected. To a lesser degree this will probably always be the case in the future.

In connection with these remarks, however, I would point to column 4 of Table III., as showing
how difficult it is to draw definite deductions from any particular set of numbers alone. This
column shows that in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 all the percentages were practically doubled
or more, and in the case of the number of men killed on the field of battle, the number was
nearly five times as great as either in the Crimea or the present campaign. The explanation
here depends on the race of men and their tenacity in resistance alone. In the case of either
nation death in battle is little feared, and slight inclination to avoid it exists. When the
theory of war held by the Boer--i.e. going out to shoot an enemy without incurring risk of
being yourself shot--is borne in mind, the special circumstances attending the present campaign
are sufficiently obvious to need little further remark. A future campaign in which the combatants
are as equally well armed, but each side stands to the last, will probably give very different
results.

It is unfortunate that no details can be given as to the influence of range in altering the
relative numbers of killed to wounded. It may be stated, however, that in no instance did the
percentage of killed to wounded reach 25 per cent. At the battle of Magersfontein it amounted
to 19.26 per cent., at Colenso to 17.97 per cent., and at both these engagements there is little
doubt that a considerable number of the men were hit within a distance of 1,000 yards. When
the distances were very short the injuries were frequently multiple; and this character was
a more common source of danger than increase of severity in the individual wounds received
at a short range.

A short consideration of the circumstances especially influencing the ultimate mortality amongst
the wounded subsequent to the reception of the injury is here necessary, although I shall be
obliged to make my remarks as short as possible. The subject is best treated of under the two
headings of Transport and Hospital Accommodation.

Transport.--The importance of transport is felt from the moment of the injury till the time
of arrival of the patient in the mother country. To the surgeon it is of the same vital importance
as the carrying of food for the troops is to the combatant general.

(a) Removal of the wounded from the field of battle. My experience was opposed to hurried action
in this matter, although it is necessary to gather up the wounded before nightfall if possible.
As a rule wounded men should not be removed from the field of battle under fire, at any rate
when the troops are in open order at a range of 1,000 yards or more. I saw several instances
in which mortal wounds were incurred by previously wounded men or their bearers during the
process of removal, while it was astonishing how many scattered wounded men could lie out under
a heavy fire and escape by the doctrine of chances. The erect position and small group necessary
to bear off a wounded man at once draws a concentrated fire, if fighting is still proceeding.

As to the best and quickest method of removing the patients to the first dressing station,
there were few occasions when this was not more satisfactorily done by bearers with stretchers
than by wagons. The movement was more easy to the wounded men, and, as a rule, time was saved.
Over rough ground the wagons travel slowly, and patients with only provisional splints were
shaken undesirably. A stretcher party in my experience easily outstripped the wagon unless
a road or very smooth veldt existed. A larger number of men is of course required, but I take
it that on the occasion of a great war men are both more easily obtained and fed than are transport
animals. From what I have been able to learn, both the Indian dhoolie-bearers and the hastily
recruited Colonial bearer companies were most successful in the removal of the large number
of wounded men from the field of Colenso. I had several opportunities of comparing the two
methods on a smaller scale during the fighting in Orange River Colony, and felt very strongly
in favour of the stretcher parties.

For removal of patients from one part of a hospital to another, or sometimes in loading trains,
&c., great economy of men, and increased comfort to the patients, may be attained by the use
of some form of ambulance trolly.

I append an illustration of what seemed to me the simplest and best I came across among several
in use in South Africa. The description beneath is by Major McCormack, R.A.M.C., its inventor
(fig. 5).

When wagons were necessary or preferable, the Indian Tongas (fig. 6), presented by Mr. Dhanjibhoy,
were most useful; they carried two men lying down, the same number as the big service wagon,
and were drawn by two ponies only. Although somewhat highly springed, the vehicle is so well
arranged and padded, that the occupants are seldom hurt by striking against the sides with
rough jolting, unless quite helpless. I occasionally made long journeys in this vehicle with
much comfort.

(b) For the longer journeys to the Field or Stationary hospitals, the service wagon and other
transport vehicles came into use, particularly the South African ox-wagon.

The service wagon (fig. 7) is a heavy four-wheeled vehicle, drawn by ten mules. The good construction
of the wagon was amply proved by the manner in which it stood the hard wear and tear of the
present campaign. It is, however, very heavy, and in comparison with its size affords very
small accommodation. Two lying-down patients and six sitting is its entire capacity. Some modified
patterns were in use, notably those with the Irish and Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospitals, capable
of carrying four lying-down cases, the men being arranged in two tiers. Major Hale, R.A.M.C.,
made a very successful trek from Rhenoster to Kroonstadt with some of these, carrying twice
the regulation number of lying-down cases in his wagons. Some modification in the mode of fixation
is, however, necessary to increase the security of the stretchers of the upper series.

A really satisfactory wagon, combining both strength and comfort, still remains to be devised.

During the later stages of the campaign, a very large number of patients were transported by
the South African ox- or mule- (buck) wagons. Although not of prepossessing appearance, and
unprovided with any sort of springs, these vehicles were far from unsatisfactory. The ox-wagon
consists of a long simple platform, 19 ft. 2 in. in length, 4 ft. 6 in. in width, from the
sides of which a slanting board rises over the wheels for the posterior two-thirds. These bulwarks
increase the actual width to 6 ft. 6 in., which corresponds with the gross width occupied by
the wheels. One third is covered by a small hood 5 ft. 6 in. in height erected on wooden stave
hoops. The latter was often absent in transport wagons. The two hind wheels are large, the
fore somewhat smaller. They are attached to very heavy wooden cross-beams bearing the axles,
and the two beams are connected by a longitudinal bar, continuous with the düssel boom or pole.
This latter bar is in two sections, the connection of which allows considerable play in the
long axis and serves to break the jolts occurring when either pair of wheels passes over uneven
spots on the ground. When some sacks of oats or hay were spread over the floor the wounded
men travelled comparatively comfortably in these wagons, the great distance between the fore
and hind wheels tending to minimise the jolting. The principal objection to them was the slow
pace of the oxen, and the fact that to obtain the greatest amount of work from these animals
a major part of the journey must be performed during the night. The ox-wagon carries, with
comfort, four lying-down cases on stretchers, or six without stretchers; or twenty sitting-up
cases.

The mule- or buck-wagon, which is of the same class but smaller, can only accommodate two stretchers,
four lying-down men without stretchers, or 12-14 sitting-up cases. As a rule, the wagons were
loaded with recumbent cases in the centre, while more slightly wounded men sat around, and
were able to give help to those lying down when needed. The wagons can be covered with canvas
throughout.

The steady even pace of the oxen is a great advantage, and I was often surprised to see how
well men bore transport in these wagons, who seemed utterly unfit to be moved had it not been
an absolute necessity. A very large number of the wounded from Paardeberg Drift were transported
to Modder River in them.

One other advantage of these wagons, the possibility of converting them into an excellent laager,
is not to be underrated. Any one who saw the comfortable encampment which a naval contingent
on the march made by massing the wagons with intervals covered by macintosh sheets, could at
once appreciate their capabilities for a long trek.

Traction engines were, as far as I know, never employed as a means of transporting the sick.
The tendency of these heavy machines to stick in the mud and to break down bridges is so well
known that it hardly needs mention. Putting these disadvantages on one side, with a supply
of fuel ensured, and such roads as are afforded by a civilised country, a great future is probably
before this means of transport for the wounded. A large number of patients might be carried
at an even pace, and the camps would be saved all the trouble and worry of the transport animals.

Trains.--In many cases in Natal, and in a few instances on the western side, the wounded men
were able to be transferred from the first dressing station directly into the trains. Space
will not allow me to describe any of those in use, but the accompanying illustration shows
the general arrangement of the beds in Nos. 2 and 3 trains (fig. 9). The carriages were converted
from ordinary bogie wagons of the Cape Government Railway stock under the supervision of Colonel
Supple, R.A.M.C., P.M.O. of the Base at Cape Town. Each train was provided with accommodation
for two medical officers, two nursing Sisters, orderlies, a kitchen, and a dispensary, and
each carried some 120 patients. The trains were under the charge of Major Russell, R.A.M.C.,
and Dr. Boswell (and later other civilian medical officers) and of Captain Fleming, R.A.M.C.,
D.S.O., and Mr. Waters, and carried many thousand patients from all parts of the country to
the Base and Station hospitals. They were most admirably worked, and seemed to offer little
scope for improvement except in minor details. To them much of the success in the treatment
of the wounded who had to traverse the immense distances incident to South Africa must be attributed.
I made many pleasant journeys in each of them. Later, two additional trains, Nos. 4 and 5,
of a similar nature, were added. Two trains, No. 1, and the Princess Christian train, which
I was not fortunate enough to see, performed similar duties for Natal.

Hospital Ships.--These were numerous and some especially well arranged. Fig. 10 is of the 'Simla,'
a P. & O. vessel which was admirably adapted to the requirements of a hospital ship. On her
main deck some 250 patients were accommodated in a series of wards all on the same level, which
much lightened the difficulties of service usually experienced. During the present campaign
the abundance of transport vessels rendered the transhipment of patients to England a matter
of comparative ease, and good vessels were always available. Considering the constant transhipment
of invalids from India and our other colonial possessions, it would seem advisable that, in
place of having to hurriedly improvise hospital ships, the Government should possess two or
three hospital ships of the 'Simla' type. It is true this would deprive our naval transport
officers of a duty which in this war was performed with extraordinary celerity and success;
thus the 'Simla' was fitted in seven days, and sailed with a cargo of invalids ten days after
her arrival at Durban; but on the other hand it would ensure that really suitable vessels were
always provided.

To give some idea of the amount of work contingent on the transport of wounded men from an
army of some 15,000, fighting its way against continued opposition, I will quote the approximate
number of men moved during Lord Methuen's advance from Orange River to Magersfontein. (The
number of men actually present at each battle is shown in Table I., p. 12.)

Belmont, the first battle, was fought on November 23.

November 24.--No. 2 hospital train removed 152 cases to the Stationary Field hospitals at Orange
River, then returned and loaded up with 130 more. Some of the most severe cases in the latter
were detrained at Orange River, and the remainder were taken direct to Wynberg (591-1/2 miles).

The division marched, and the battle of Graspan was fought during the day.

November 26.--A train of specially constructed trucks brought 90 of the less severe cases,
including 20 Boers, to Orange River.

November 27.--The division marched, and in the morning No. 3 hospital train removed 80 severe
cases from the Field hospitals direct to Wynberg.

November 28.--Battle of Modder River.

November 29.--339 patients, including a few sick, and some wounded Boers, were sent down to
Orange River in open trucks with impromptu shelters made with rifles and blankets.

Later, 97 severe cases were sent down in ordinary carriages, of which some had doors sawn out
to admit lying-down patients.

December 10.--The division marched, and on the next day the battle of Magersfontein was fought.

December 11.--Nos. 2 and 3 trains were loaded up during the night and early morning of the
12th, in part from the Field hospitals, in part directly from the Ambulance wagons. During
the day of the 12th, No. 3 train made three journeys to Orange River, and No. 2 was sent direct
to Wynberg.

In all some 800 patients needed transport; they were picked up by 10 ambulance wagons and 5
buck wagons for slighter cases and the two bearer companies sent out from Modder River. On
the 12th Lord Methuen sent out a number of bearers with stretchers, and at 12 noon all the
wounded were collected, but many had lain out through the night. The bearers had to retire
under a shell fire kept up by the Boers as long as our army was within range of their position.

Four Field hospitals were present, but only that of the IX. Brigade at Modder River was so
situated as to be of general use. This hospital, under the command of Major Harris, R.A.M.C.,
did an immense amount of work most expeditiously and with great success.

The nature of the advance on Kimberley necessitated the evacuation of the Field hospitals with
extreme promptitude, as the troops were in constant action, and the arrangements for this were
carried out with great success by Colonel Townsend, the P.M.O. of the First Division.

The amount of fighting far exceeded anything that had been expected, and the Stationary hospitals
on the lines of communication at Orange River and De Aar were unable to cope with the number
of severe cases thrown on their hands, with the constant possibility of new arrivals. Hence
a number of severe cases had to be sent direct to Wynberg.

This experience strongly illustrated the necessity of possessing Stationary hospitals of greater
mobility and a higher degree of equipment than the service at present possesses. In these a
large number of severe cases could have been retained, and only the slighter ones exposed to
the fatigue and general disadvantage of transport. In South Africa very special difficulties
existed in the length of the line of communication, the single line of rails, and the absence
of any source of supply within 500 to 600 miles; but in any other country mobile Stationary
hospitals, although more easily equipped, would be equally valuable.

The difficulties of transport experienced in the advance of the Kimberley Relief Force were
many times multiplied in that upon Bloemfontein, since the whole of the severely wounded men
had to be sent back thirty to forty miles to the railway. The ambulance accommodation on the
occasion of this march, although, if untouched, proportionately smaller than that possessed
by Lord Methuen, was reduced to one-fifth to meet the exigencies of warfare. Beyond this the
equipment transport of the Field hospitals was reduced from four ox-wagons to two, and the
Scotch cart was cut off, only two ox-wagons and the two water-carts being allowed. This greatly
hampered the Field hospitals on the march, and when they arrived at Bloemfontein and had to
undertake the work of Stationary hospitals, their efficiency was seriously impaired. Again,
on the advance from Bloemfontein to Kroonstadt many of the Field hospitals were unable to accompany
their respective divisions, not alone on account of the number of patients remaining in them,
but also because the mule transport had been otherwise employed for military purposes.

The transport of the ambulances and hospitals stands in a very special position. As far as
my experience went, neither ambulances nor hospitals were ever taken or retained by the Boers,
and consequently the transport animals originally devoted to this purpose should have been
held sacred to it.

Hospitals.--Accommodation for the wounded was provided under canvas in the Field hospitals,
also in the large General hospitals. Beyond this iron huts were erected in many of the Base
and Station hospitals. At Capetown, Maritzburg, and Ladysmith barrack huts were modified and
equipped as hospitals, and in towns such as Bloemfontein, Kimberley, and Johannesburg large
civil hospitals were at our disposal. Beyond these sources of accommodation, churches, schools,
public institutions, and private houses were made use of in the smaller towns.

As to the broad question of canvas v. buildings, experience amply showed that in a climate
such as is possessed by South Africa, canvas affords the greater advantages. The hospitals
are more mobile, more readily extended, and the more healthy. Except under unusual conditions
of rain and dust, the patients did excellently in the tents.

Rain and dust were occasionally most troublesome, especially when combined with wind. I once
saw a whole hospital, fortunately unoccupied, levelled to the ground in the course of some
twenty minutes. Under such circumstances iron huts present advantages, and were on many occasions
utilised with much success. They are readily erected, and it would have been a considerable
improvement if a number of them had been ready for use at the earliest part of the campaign.
Except in the matter of weight, they possess in a considerable degree the advantage of mobility
possessed by canvas, and in addition they offer much more protection from the weather. On the
other hand, they are more liable to become unhealthy from prolonged use.

Churches and public institutions were mainly troublesome from the necessity of having to improvise
sanitary arrangements, and sometimes the disadvantage of the collection of a large number of
men in one chamber could not be avoided. None the less I cannot look back without admiration
on the temporary hospitals established in the Raadzaal at Bloemfontein, and the Irish hospital
in the Palace of Justice in Pretoria.

The State schools in the smaller towns of the Orange River Colony also afforded excellent accommodation
as small temporary hospitals.

Private houses, possessing the disadvantages of ill-adapted construction and the necessity
of a considerably increased staff to work them, were on the whole little used as hospitals.
The scattered farmhouses occasionally afforded shelter to very severely wounded men. In most
of the country I traversed, however, the farms were so wide apart as to be of little use in
this respect; and again, under the special circumstances, patients left in them might have
to be abandoned to the enemy.

The chief interest during the campaign centred in the working of the Field and General hospitals.

Two types of Field hospital were employed, one the Home, the other the Indian. The latter differs
from the Home in that in it the bearer company is attached and consists of Indian natives,
and that the hospital is separable into four sections in place of two only.

The amalgamation of the Field hospital and bearer company into one unit is much to be desired
in the Home service, both for economy of working and the more equal distribution of duties
to the medical officers engaged. Again the divisibility of the hospital into four sections
is also an advantage. It allows of the advance or the leaving of sections, in the case of either
small expeditions or the presence of a number of severely wounded men unfit to travel. As far
as I could judge, it necessitates very small addition to the present equipment, and is in every
way desirable.

As to the working of the Field hospitals in the present campaign, it was universally acknowledged
to possess a very high degree of excellence. The equipment, with small exceptions, proved equal
to the demands made upon it. The mobility of the camps was proved again and again, and the
rules governing their administration evidenced by their effectiveness the care and experience
which have been bestowed on the organisation of the hospitals.

It is difficult for any one who has not had an opportunity of observing the actual amount of
work performed in the Field hospitals either to appreciate the storm and stress following an
important engagement when the wounded men are first brought in, or the demands that are made
on the powers of the medical officers in charge. To a civilian the first feeling is one of
impotence, followed by an attempt to see no further than the case under immediate observation,
and to nurture the conviction that the work is to be got through if it is only stuck to. I
gathered that this first impression was absent in the minds of the officers in charge of the
Field hospitals, as work commenced at once, and was carried on without intermission during
the persistence of daylight, in the winter often by the aid of lanterns, and eventually the
huge task was accomplished. In early days at Orange River work commenced at 4 A.M., and was
steadily continued until 6 P.M. or later, and this state of things persisted sometimes for
many days together.

The officers of the Field hospitals, the bearer companies, and those doing regimental duty
carried out their duties with a calmness and efficiency which not only impressed observers
like myself, but also excited the admiration of our German colleagues sent by their government
to observe the working of the British system.

I saw on several occasions the German and Dutch ambulances, and was much struck by the excellence
of their equipment. In some details there was much to be learned from them, especially in the
matter of appliances, dressings, and instruments. The Dutch ambulance I saw at Brandfort had
a complete installation of acetylene gas, which was carried, gasometer and all, in one Scotch
cart. They were, however, really designed to fill the combined position of our Field, Stationary,
and General hospitals, and when it became necessary for them to move about frequently, the
inferior mobility they possessed in comparison with our own Field hospitals was at once demonstrated.

The large General hospitals of 500 beds were a great feature in the campaign. Although designed
and organised some time since, the present was the first occasion on which they have come into
general use, and they may be said to have actually been on trial. The organisation of these
hospitals proved itself excellent, and in the case of the best of them left little to be desired.

In some cases the accommodation was temporarily strained enormously, and the number of patients
was extended beyond more than three times the regulation limit. The additional patients were
then accommodated in marquees and bell tents, according to the nature of their diseases. Under
these circumstances the working of the hospitals was difficult, and the officers both of the
R.A.M.C. and the civilian surgeons were placed at a great disadvantage.

My space does not allow me to give any description of the general arrangement of these hospitals,
but I would suggest that a certain number of them should be so modified as to increase their
mobility and allow of their being more readily utilised as Stationary hospitals.

During the whole campaign it seemed to me that the Stationary hospitals (that is to say, the
hospitals necessary to receive patients when the Field hospitals were rapidly evacuated), were
those in which some increased uniformity of organisation was most needed.

It scarcely needs to be pointed out that this is the most difficult link of the whole hospital
chain to be uniformly well organised and equipped. It is needed at short notice, and often
for a short period, and it is difficult to maintain a regular staff of officers ready for any
emergency without keeping a certain number of men idle.

The conversion of Field hospitals to Stationary purposes is undesirable, as the troops move
with only a regulation number of the former, which under ordinary circumstances is the minimum
that may be necessary.

Stationary hospitals as individual units are undesirable for the reasons above given.

The difficulty might be met by increasing the mobility of a certain number of the General hospitals,
by making them divisible into five sections, each of which should be able to move independently,
and to the last of which should be attached the heavy part of the equipment, such as the iron
huts for operating and X-ray rooms, kitchens, store sheds, &c. The tents might also be lightened
by the substitution of the tortoise tent for the service marquee. The tortoise tent is lighter
(360 as against 500 lbs.), easily pitched and moved, and holds at least two more patients with
ease. The capabilities of this tent were amply proven during its use by the Portland, Irish,
and other civil hospitals attached to the army. It withstood wind and weather, the former better
than the service marquee. Figs. 11 and 12 show the appearance of camps composed of the two
varieties. I must admit a warm preference for the appearance of the service pattern, but I
think it is indubitable that the other is the more useful.

Given the possibility of division of a General hospital in this manner, single sections could
readily be sent up the lines of communication to serve as Stationary hospitals at various points
behind the advance of the troops, and on the cessation of active need, the sections could be
reunited at any point to form an advanced Base hospital. The sections could be kept in touch
throughout by visits from the officer of the lines of communication. This would appear a ready
means of providing well-organised Stationary hospitals at short notice, and would save the
disadvantage of a definitely separate series.

Such hospitals might have been used on many occasions when the transport of an entire General
hospital was an impossibility. The service, moreover, has some experience in this direction,
since at one time No. 3 General Hospital was divided into two definite sections.

Bearing in mind the extreme readiness and promptitude with which the officers during the present
campaign extended the accommodation of either Field or General hospitals, one of such sections
as are proposed might readily be made far more capacious than its regulation number would suggest.

My duties being entirely in connection with the service hospitals, I did not become intimately
acquainted with any of the volunteer hospitals which did such excellent service, except the
Portland, to the staff of which I was indebted for much hospitality and kindness. This hospital
was practically of about the capacity proposed for the above-mentioned sections, and the report
of its work will no doubt furnish many points of detail as to equipment, &c., which may be useful.

The general results of the surgical work done during the campaign were excellent, and taken
as a whole the occurrence of any severe form of septic disease was unusual.

Pure septicæmia, especially in connection with abdominal injuries, severe head injuries and
secondary to acute traumatic osteo-myelitis, was the form most commonly seen. Pyæmia with secondary
deposits was uncommon, and often of a somewhat subacute form; thus I saw several patients recover
after secondary abscesses had been opened, or the primary focus of infection removed. The only
really acute case of joint pyæmia I heard of, developed in connection with a blistered toe
followed by cellulitis of the foot.

Cutaneous erysipelas I never happened to see, and really acute phlegmonous inflammation was rare.

I may mention the occurrence of acute traumatic gangrene in two cases. This developed in each
instance with gunshot fracture of the femur; in one amputation was performed, and the process
extended upwards on to the abdomen. The cases occurred with the army in the field in the neighbourhood
of Thaba-nchu and not in a stationary hospital.

Acute traumatic tetanus occurred only in one instance to my knowledge. In this case the primary
injury was a shell wound of the thigh, and the patient developed the disease and died within
ten days.

To the civil surgeon the performance of operations, and the dressing of severe wounds at the
front, proved on occasions a somewhat trying ordeal.

When operations were necessary in the field, during the daytime, it was often possible to perform
them in the open air, provided tolerable protection could be obtained from the sun. A number
of cases were so operated upon during the march of the Highland Brigade from Wynberg to Heilbron,
and gave excellent results, the patients deriving considerable benefit from the early cleansing
and closure of the wounds.

In camp, in the Field, or Stationary hospitals, the difficulties were often much greater. The
operations were necessarily performed under shelter for reasons of privacy. In the tents the
draught carrying the dust from the camp was one of the commonest troubles. The exclusion of
dust was impossible, and it not only found its way into open wounds, but permeated bandages
with ease. Often when a bandage was removed, an even layer of dust moistened by perspiration
covered the whole area included with a coating of mud. Again, in dust storms a similar layer
of mud sometimes covered the whole of the exposed parts of the bodies of patients lying on
the ground in the tents.

It is of some interest to remark with regard to this dust, that Dr. L. L. Jenner lately kindly
examined a specimen collected at Modder River after the camp had been more than two months
established, and discovered no pathogenic organisms in it. As a period of seven months had
elapsed since this dust was collected, the fact is of no practical import, beyond showing that,
if such organisms had existed, at any rate they were not of a resistent nature.

Insects, particularly common house-flies, were an intolerable pest at times. In a fresh camp
they were sometimes not abundant, but after two or three days they multiplied enormously. Not
only hospital tents, but living and mess tents, swarmed with them, the canvas appearing positively
black at night. Even when dressing a wound, without unceasing passage of the hand across the
part, it was impossible to keep them from settling, and during operations the nuisance was
much greater.

Storms of rain were occasionally as troublesome as, though perhaps less harmful than, those
of dust. On one occasion a whole Field hospital was flooded only a few hours after a number
of important operations had been performed, and the patients were practically washed out of
the tents. It was somewhat remarkable that none of the men suffered any serious ill as a result.

At times the temperature was sufficiently high to make either dressing or operating a most
exhausting process to the surgeon. The heat of the day was not on the whole so disadvantageous
from the point of view of the operator, as the cold of the nights during the winter in Orange
River Colony. On one or two occasions serious operations had to be left undone, as it was only
possible to consider them in camp, where, as we arrived at night only, the temperature was
too low to justify the necessary exposure.

Water for use at operations was often a great difficulty. Even at Orange River, where, though
muddy, the water was wholesome, it was impossible to get water suitable for operations unless
it had previously gone through the complicated processes of precipitation by alum, boiling,
and filtration. At Orange River a small room in the house of one of the railway servants was
obtained and fitted as a rough operating room by the Royal Engineers. The necessary utensils
were provided by Colonel Young, Commissioner of the Red Cross Societies. Here a stock of prepared
water was kept for emergencies.

The remaining difficulties mainly consisted in those we are familiar with in civil practice,
such as the securing of suitable assistance in the handling of instruments and dressing, when
the rush of work was very great.

At the Base hospitals accommodation for operating in properly equipped rooms obviated many
of the difficulties above referred to.

In concluding this introduction I should sum up in a few words my experience of the general
working of the hospital system during my stay in South Africa.

The excellence of the Field hospitals for their purpose has been already alluded to, and, as
far as I could ascertain, won the confidence and approval of patients, military commanders,
and civilians such as myself.

The Stationary hospitals (by which I intend to indicate those receiving the patients directly
from the Field hospitals before the establishment of advanced Base hospitals), as already indicated,
were not in my opinion so perfectly conceived or organised. The requirements of these are,
however, far greater than those of the Field hospitals, and they of all others are dependent
on the possession of facilities for rapid transport. In South Africa the difficulties of supplying
them were enormous, and no doubt the conditions of the campaign in this, as so many other particulars,
were novel and unusual. None the less the experience gained will no doubt be utilised in the
future. With regard to the extravagant criticisms levelled at the Field hospitals serving as
Stationary hospitals at the time of the early period of the occupation of Bloemfontein, it
may be pointed out that the only proper ground for comparison was not between the patients
at Bloemfontein and those in hospital at the base, but between the men in hospital and those
in the field at that time, since the conditions were equally adverse to both. Besides, it must
not be forgotten that a large proportion of the patients, at that time, were really comfortably
housed in the Raadzaal and other buildings, the preparation of which entailed a very great
amount of both labour and resource.

The difficulties experienced at that time will, it is hoped, go far towards securing greater
facilities and rights of transport to the Royal Army Medical Corps in the future. As a civilian,
one cannot but recognise that the conditions of modern warfare are much altered from those
of the past. Prisoners are well cared for and kindly treated, the sick and wounded are respected
by both sides, and except in the actual horrors of fighting the condition of the soldier is
a happier one. Under these circumstances the limitation of the transport facilities of a department
so closely concerned with the well-being of all, and which has been organised on a most moderate
scale, must soon become a tradition of the past in civilised armies.

As to the efficiency of the organisation of the General hospitals, either at the advanced or
actual base, I have already testified. Naturally the working of these hospitals varied with
the personal equation of the officer in charge of them, but as a whole the service has every
reason to be proud of their success. As far as surgical results are concerned, and with these
I had special acquaintance, the success of the hospitals was amply demonstrated.

Adverse criticism was not however wanting, and often expressed in the strongest terms by persons
totally unacquainted with hospital methods, and apparently unconscious that such excellence
as is exhibited in a London hospital is the result of continuous work and development for some
centuries, and that such institutions are worked by committees and staffs of permanent constitution.

The proportion of female nurses employed in these hospitals underwent steady increase from
the commencement of the campaign, and the immense value of the nursing reserve was fully proved.
There is no doubt that in Base hospitals the actual nursing should always be entrusted to women.

The demands of the campaign necessitated the employment of a large number of civil surgeons
in the various hospitals. These gentlemen accommodated themselves with true British aptitude
to the conditions under which they were placed, and in all positions their sterling work contributed
in no small degree to the success that was attained.

One class of hospital still remains for mention. I refer to the improvised hospitals prepared
in the Boer towns prior to the British occupation. They were met with in all the smaller towns,
and also in the larger ones such as Johannesburg and Pretoria.

The Burke hospital in Pretoria, started by a private citizen and his daughter, and the Victoria
hospital in Johannesburg, presided over by Dr. and Mrs. Murray, were two of the largest, but
each and all deserve due recognition.

I am sure that many of our wounded officers and men who were cared for in these hospitals while
prisoners in the hands of the Boers, will never lose their sense of gratitude to those inhabitants
who spared no effort to render their position as happy as possible under the circumstances;
and the existence of these hospitals was no small boon to the service when called upon to take
charge of the sick and wounded therein contained.

I cannot close this chapter without recognition of the immensity of the task which has fallen
on the Royal Army Medical Corps in the treatment of the sick and wounded during the course
of the campaign and full appreciation of the manner in which that task has been met. The strain
thrown upon this department of the service, originally organised for the needs of an army less
than half the magnitude of that eventually taking the field, was incalculably great, and the
medical profession may well be proud of the efforts made by its military representatives to
do the best possible work under the circumstances.

CHAPTER II

MODERN MILITARY RIFLES AND THEIR PROJECTILES IN RELATION TO INJURIES PRODUCED BY THEM ON THE
HUMAN BODY

Before proceeding to the actual description of the wounds inflicted by modern military rifles,
it is necessary to prefix a few remarks on the mechanism and mode of production of these injuries.

Recent tendency in the construction of military rifles has been in the direction of reduction
of bore, and a corresponding one in the calibre of the bullet, the resulting loss of weight
in the latter as an element in striking power being compensated for by the attainment of an
augmentation of velocity in the flight of the projectile, and a comparatively flat trajectory.

Changes in this direction have endowed the weapons with increase both in range and accuracy
of fire; while the greater rapidity with which magazine rifles can be discharged and, in consequence
of reduction in weight, the greater number of cartridges which can be carried by each man,
also form important factors in the possible deadliness of warfare at the present day. None
the less the experience of the present campaign has scarcely justified the early prognostications
expressed as to a great increase in the number and severity of wounds amongst the combatants.[5]
This comparative immunity is to be explained mainly on two grounds. The increased distance
which for the most part separated the two bodies of men, a feature no doubt accentuated by
the mode of warfare adopted by the Boer, and his strong sense of the folly of close combat
on equal terms, tended to efface one of the chief characters, velocity of flight, on the part
of the projectile. The want of effectiveness of the small-calibre bullet as an instrument of
serious mischief also kept down the mortality.

Since the year 1889 the calibre of the bullet in our own army has been reduced from that of
the Martini-Henry (.450 in.) to one of .309 in. in the Lee-Metford, and a consequent reduction
in weight from 480 to 215 grains. To allow of the satisfactory assumption of the more complicated
rifling by the more rapidly projected bullet, the lead core has been ensheathed in a mantle
of denser metal. The bullet itself is of an original calibre (.309 in.) somewhat exceeding
the bore of the rifle barrel (.303 in.), in which way a species of 'choke' is obtained and
deep rifling of the surface ensured. Beyond this the comparative transverse and longitudinal
measurements and shape have been altered in order to maintain weight, preserve a proper balance
during flight, and increase the power of penetration. These alterations with slight differences
in detail embody the general principles that underlie the construction of each of the weapons
adopted by European nations. It will be well here to consider the influence of each alteration
from the point of view of the surgeon.

Calibre.--The effect of the diminution of calibre is (a) to reduce the area of impact of the
bullet on the part impinged upon, and hence to lower the degree of resistance offered by the
tissues; this to a certain extent tends to neutralise the augmented striking force resulting
from the increased velocity of flight. (b) To limit considerably the destructive powers of
the bullet, as a smaller area of tissue is exposed to its action. (c) To allow of the production
of very 'neat' injuries and the frequent escape of important structures, also the production
of remarkably prolonged subcutaneous tracks in positions where such would be regarded as scarcely
possible, and in point of fact were impossible with the older and larger projectiles.

Length.--The comparative increase in length of the bullet is, from the surgical point of view,
only of material importance in increasing the weight and therefore the striking power, and
in so far as it is a mechanical necessity for the flight of the projectile on an axis parallel
to its long diameter, and so tends to ensure impact on the body by the tip of the bullet. This
latter is, however, surgically favourable as ensuring a smaller wound.

Weight.--The decrease in weight must be regarded on the whole as altogether to the advantage
of the wounded individual, since it cannot be considered to be entirely compensated for by
the resulting increased velocity of flight, unless the range of fire is moderately close.

Shape.--The ogival tip and general wedge-like outline, while decreasing the aerial resistance
to and increasing the power of penetration possessed by the bullet, at the same time allow
the escape of some structures by displacement, while others are saved from complete destruction
by undergoing perforation. Beyond this the sharper the tip, the smaller is the area of the
body primarily impinged upon, the less the resistance offered to perforation, and to some degree
the less the destruction of surrounding tissues.

Increased velocity of flight.--This multiplies the striking force, and compensates in part
for decrease in volume and weight of the bullet. It is customary to speak of the velocity as
'initial' and 'remaining.' Initial velocity is the term employed to express the velocity at
the time of the escape of the bullet from the barrel; this is also designated as 'muzzle velocity.'
'Remaining velocity' expresses that obtaining during any subsequent portion of the flight of
the projectile.

The greatest initial velocity is obtained with the use of bullets of the smallest calibre,
but this is not of the practical importance which might be assumed, since the remaining velocity
of flight of such projectiles falls more rapidly than that of those of slightly greater mass.
Thus, although there may be a difference of a hundred metres per second in initial velocity
between two rifles of calibres varying from 6.5 to 8 millimetres (.303-.314 in.), at the end
of 1,000 metres the discrepancy is greatly reduced, while at 2,000 metres it hardly exists.
Under such circumstances the projectile of greater weight and volume, as possessing the greater
striking force, is considerably the more formidable of the two. This is the more important
if it be allowed, as I believe to be the case, that velocity per se is of no practical import
in the case of wounds of the soft parts of the body, which after all form the preponderating
number of all gunshot injuries. The effect of the higher degrees of velocity differs, however,
with the amount of resistance met with on the part of the body; hence its serious import is
well exemplified when parts of the osseous skeleton are implicated, although even here considerable
variations exist, dependent upon the structure of that part of the bone actually involved.
The most obvious ill effect of injuries from bullets travelling at high rates is seen in the
case of the various parts of the nervous system, and here it is undeniable. High velocity and
striking force are also responsible for the prolonged course sometimes taken by bullets through
the body.

The actual degree of velocity, as judged by the range of fire at which an injury is received
and the resulting injury, is very hard to estimate on account of the many and varying factors
which enter into its determination. The mere recital of some of these will suffice to make
this evident.

1. Quality of the individual cartridge employed, as to loading, the materials employed, and
their condition.

2. The condition of the rifle as to cleanliness, heating, and the state of the grooves of the
barrel.

3. The angle of impact of the bullet with the part injured.

4. Resistance dependent on the weight of the whole body of the man struck, or of an isolated limb.

5. Special peculiarities of build in the individual struck, such as thickness and density of
the integument and fasciæ, strength and thickness of the bones, &c.

6. State of tension of the muscles, fasciæ, and ligaments at the moment of impact, and fixity
or otherwise of the part of the body struck.

7. The degree of wind, temperature, and hygroscopic conditions of the atmosphere.

These form some of the more important points which have to be taken into consideration, in
addition to a mere calculation of the actual distance from which a wound has been received
from a particular rifle, and taken with the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence as to the
latter, which is usually alone obtainable, it is clear that definite assumptions are scarcely
possible. In a great number of cases I came to the conclusion that the only indisputable evidence
of low velocity was the lodgment of an undeformed bullet. There is little doubt, moreover,
that the general tendency of wounded men was to minimise the range of fire at which they were
struck, and again that in the majority of cases in this campaign it was quite impossible to
determine whence any particular bullet had come, since the enemy was seldom arranged in one
line, but rather in several. Again, smokeless powder was generally employed. Beyond this, in
some cases where there was no doubt of the short distance from which the bullet was fired,
the wounds were due to 'ricochet' of portions of broken-up bullets. The following instance
well illustrates this. A sentry fired five times at two men within a distance of six paces,
knocking both down. One man received a severe direct fracture of the ilium, the bullet entering
between the anterior superior and inferior iliac spines and emerging at the upper part of the
buttock. The entry and exit apertures were large but hardly 'explosive,' as a subcutaneous
track four to five inches long separated them. Besides this both men had other lesser injuries;
thus in the second two perforating wounds of the arm existed. The latter were not unlike type
Lee-Metford wounds, and were regarded as such until a few days afterwards when a hard body
was felt in the distal portion of one track and removed. This proved to be a part of the leaden
core only, and the similar wound had no doubt been produced by a like fragment, the bullet
having broken up on striking the stony ground.

Trajectory.--The comparative flatness of this depends on the construction of the rifle and
the propulsive force employed, and varies as does velocity with the nature, excellence, and
amount of the explosive, the correctness of the principles upon which the bullet is devised,
and the mechanical perfection of its manufacture. Its importance naturally consists in the
manner in which it affects the possibility of covering objects on a wide area of ground and
thus creating a broad 'dangerous zone.' A bullet fired on level ground from any one of three
of the rifles referred to later (Lee-Metford, Mauser, Krag-Jörgensen), sighted to 500 yards
and fired from the shoulder in the standing position, will cover some part of an erect man
of average height during the whole extent of its flight. A body of men within that distance
is therefore in a position of extreme peril in the face of a good shooting enemy.

The importance of a flat trajectory is progressively lost, however, with any rifle, as the
weapon is gradually sighted to greater distances. Thus when sighted to 2,000 yards the bullet
from the Lee-Metford rifle rises 174 feet, and a whole army might comfortably be situated over
a considerable area within that distance. The importance of flatness of trajectory is also
influenced by the nature of the ground occupied by the combatants. Thus when the area to be
covered consists in ground first rising then falling from the rifleman, the trajectory will
become more or less parallel to the surface crossed, and the 'dangerous zone' will be correspondingly
increased in extent. On the other hand, when the ground slopes away from the rifleman the rise
of the projectile is exaggerated, and reaches its most limited capacity of covering an intervening
space when the flight crosses a hollow.

Revolution of the bullet.--It only remains in this place to say a few words concerning the
revolution imparted to the bullet by the rifling of the barrel. This ensures the flight of
the projectile on a line parallel to its long axis, and notably increases its power of penetration.

Both these properties of the flight are to the advantage of the wounded, since, as already
mentioned, the more exactly the impact corresponds to a right angle with the skin, the more
limited will be the area of contusion, even if it be of the most severe character, while to
the twist of the bullet must be ascribed a not inconsiderable part in the explanation of the
ready and neat perforations of narrow structures which are frequently produced.

It has been pointed out that the Lee-Metford bullet turns on its own axis once in a distance
of ten inches, while the Mauser revolves once in a distance of eight and eleven-sixteenths
inches; hence not more than at most two revolutions are made in tracks crossing the trunk,
and not more than half a full revolution in the perforation of a limb. None the less, no one
can deny the influence of the one half turn of supination in entering a perforating tool of
any description, both as preventing splintering, and in preserving the surrounding parts from
damage.

Beyond this, the spiral turn of the bullet, by diverting a part of the transmitted vibrations
into a second direction, must, in the case of wounds of the body, help to throw off contiguous
structures, and while those that are in actual contact are more severely contused, the surrounding
ones suffer somewhat less direct injury. It must be borne in mind, also, that rapidity of revolution
does not fall pari passu with that of velocity of flight, but that the former undergoes a comparatively
slighter diminution until the bullet is actually spent. Hence, the influence of revolution
is felt, however low the velocity may be, provided sufficient striking force is retained to
enter the body. A word must be added here as to the surface of a discharged bullet; this, in
taking the rifling of the barrel, becomes permanently grooved. The depth of the groove differs
with the variety of rifle. In the Lee-Metford the grooves are deep (.009), in the Mauser slightly
less so (.007), but the surface of both bullets is comparatively roughened when revolving in
the body, and this circumstance, since the projectile exactly fits its track, may influence
the degree of the surface destruction of tissue, and somewhat aid in the clean perforation
of bone, since a little bone dust is always found at the entrance aperture of a canal in cancellous
bone.

During the campaign many varieties of rifle projecting bullets of widely differing calibre
were employed by the Boers, many of whom as sportsmen preferred the rifle to which they were
accustomed to a regulation weapon, and an illustration of a large variety of bullets from cartridges
which I collected from arsenals and camps is given below (p. 96). The great majority of the
men, however, were armed with small-calibre weapons of some sort, and as the wounds produced
by these are of chief interest at the present day, I shall say little of any others, beyond
an occasional reference to Martini-Henry rifle wounds which may be considered to represent
approximately those made by large leaden sporting bullets.

The most important, as the most frequently employed, rifles projecting small-calibre bullets
were the Krag-Jörgensen, Mauser, Lee-Metford, and Guedes, given in the order of increase of
calibre (from 6.5 to 8 millimetres, or .254-.314 in.) in the bullets. As to the seriousness
of wounds produced by these there is little to choose, differences in character being only
those of degree. Such differences depended on the area of tissue implicated, corresponding
with the calibre of the particular bullet, the comparative weight of the bullet, and the degree
of velocity of flight maintained at the moment of impact. When, however, any of these bullets
have been exposed in their flight to influences capable of causing deformity of their outline
and symmetry, peculiarities of construction and in the composition of the metals employed in
their manufacture may materially alter the character of the wounds produced and revolutionise
a classification founded purely on the relative weight, calibre, and degree of velocity with
which each is endowed.

Some particulars of the four rifles and their projectiles are collated in Table I., to which
is added the corresponding information regarding the Martini-Henry for the purposes of comparison.

TABLE II.--PENETRATION

The penetration of the Martini-Henry and the Lee-Metford or Lee-Enfield rifle with Mark II.
bullet is as follows:

Martini-Henry           15-1/2 in. of 1 in. deal boards  19 in. of sand
                            1 in. apart                  containing 15 per
                                                         cent. of moisture

Lee-Metford {Mark II.}  42 in. of 1 in. deal boards      60 in. of sand
Lee-Enfield {bullet  }      1 in. apart                  containing 15 per
                                                         cent. of moisture

The penetration of bullets of .314 calibre differs little from that possessed by the Lee-Metford
or Lee-Enfield, of which the muzzle velocities are very little lower, with Mark II. bullet.
The Belgian Mauser perforates 55 inches of fir-wood at 12 metres distance. With regard to the
penetration of bullets of smaller calibre that of the Roumanian Mannlicher (.256) may be taken
as typical. When fired into a sand butt at 25 yards the bullet enters 9 inches and then breaks up.

The comparative size of the different cartridges is shown in fig. 14.

The general remarks already made as to the effect of weight, calibre, and velocity sufficiently
explain the importance of the particulars given in this table, but it will be noted that the
Lee-Metford rifle is inferior to both the Krag-Jörgensen and Mauser rifles in the initial velocity
transmitted to its bullet. The tendency to equalisation, in this particular, when the remaining
velocity is considered, has been mentioned; but it may be of interest if I quote from Nimier
and Laval[7] the scale on which the decrease in velocity takes place in the case of the three
weapons.

Giving full importance to the effects of velocity as a factor in the severity of the injuries
produced, when the large proportion of wounds received at distances above 1,000 yards is borne
in mind, we see how rapidly the superiority of the smaller projectiles is lost. This loss,
even in the early stages, is probably more than made up for in the case of the Lee-Metford,
when the superiority in weight, calibre, and bluntness of extremity as contributing to striking
force is taken into consideration.

The striking force (kinetic energy) of a bullet is indicated by the following formula: F =
1/2 mv.^{2}; that is to say, the striking force is equal to half the weight of the bullet multiplied
by the square of the velocity.

In point of fact, with unaltered regulation bullets I was never able to determine any very
material difference between the wounds produced, further than that the wounds of entry and
exit in the soft parts tended to correspond with the calibre of the particular bullet concerned.
Although the immense majority of the wounds which came under my notice were caused by the Mauser
bullet, yet I saw some hundreds of wounded Boers and a good many of our own men wounded by
Lee-Metford bullets, in the latter case no doubt by some of the sporting varieties. The only
cases that I can call to mind or have noted as exhibiting a superior wounding power in the
Lee-Metford bullet are some injuries to bone. Thus I saw a considerable number of clean perforations
of the patella produced by Mauser bullets, while the only two Boers whom I saw with injured
patellæ had suffered transverse fractures. Again, I have a lively recollection of an old Boer
who had suffered a fracture of the middle third of the femur, in the thigh of whom, with small
apertures of entry and exit, a cavity of destroyed tissue, five inches across, was found beneath
the fascia lata at the distal side of the fracture. I cannot however say that I did not observe
many equally severe injuries to the femur produced by Mauser bullets in our own men, and as
far as fractures of the skull went, a somewhat crucial test, among the men brought off the
battlefield alive, I never saw any difference in severity whatever.

These points of comparison having been made, it only remains to consider one other point, that
of the relative stability of the bullets. This is a matter of the greatest importance as regards
the regularity or otherwise of the wounding power of the projectile, and, as far as my experience
went, I believe the Mauser to far exceed the Lee-Metford in instability of structure.

The core of all four bullets is composed of lead hardened by a certain admixture of tin or
antimony, but the mantle differs in composition, thickness both general and in different parts
of the bullet, mode of fixation, and consequently in its power of resistance to violence.

Fig. 15 gives an exact representation of the relative thickness of the mantles, and shows the
general tendency to a thickening of the mantle at its upper extremity, designed to increase
both the stability and striking power of the projectile. It will be noted that in general stoutness
the Lee-Metford stands first, as the case increases gradually in thickness from base to apex.

Beyond this it must be noted that the Lee-Metford is the only one of the four that is ensheathed
with a mantle composed of a definite alloy, this consisting of 80 parts of nickel and 20 of
copper. Two of the remaining bullets, the Mauser and Krag-Jörgensen, are ensheathed with steel
covered with a thin coating of an alloy of copper or cupro-nickel, to take the rifling of the
barrel, while the third has a plain steel mantle which is covered with a layer of wax to take
the place of the nickel used in the manufacture of the two others. It is interesting to mention
here that the Boers evidently found the copper alloy coating insufficient for its purpose,
or at any rate not satisfactory in preserving the weapon from the ill-effects consequent on
the friction between the steel case and the rifling of the barrel, as at about the middle of
the campaign they began to use their bullets waxed, as in the case of the Austrian Mannlicher;
hence the legend of the poisoned bullets which caused such a sensation for a short period amongst
the uninitiated. It is possible also that the additional layer of wax was necessitated by the
wearing of the barrel.

The wax employed for the Mauser bullets was not originally green. Mr. Leslie B. Taylor informs
me that it is probably paraffin wax, the green colour depending on the formation of verdigris
from the copper alloy with which the steel envelopes are plated. This completely corresponds
with my own experience, since on the bullets in my possession the green colour, originally
pale, has steadily increased in depth. Many old leaden bullets I found in the Boer arsenals
were also waxed, but in this case no alteration in colour had taken place. The Guedes bullets,
which are cased in mild steel, become somewhat brown with exposure from a similar oxidation
or rusting of the surface.

As far as my experience went, however, the steel casing has an important surgical bearing beyond
the mere question of wear and tear on the rifle barrel. That it possesses elasticity and capability
of bending is obvious, and in a later chapter, devoted to irregular wounds, several illustrations
of such deformities are given; but when it strikes stone I believe it splits and tears with
very much greater freedom than the cupro-nickel mantle of the Lee-Metford. At any rate, I never
came across Lee-Metford bullets deformed to the same degree as Mauser bullets, either when
removed from the body, or as ricochet projectiles on the field of battle. For this reason,
therefore, provided the fighting takes place on stony ground, I believe the Mauser bullet and
others ensheathed in steel to be much more dangerous surgically than those encased in cupro-nickel.
I fancy this would be equally the case even if the mantles were of exactly the same thickness.

The layer of copper alloy on the steel mantles is also a physical characteristic worthy of
mention. This very readily chips off in a manner similar to that we are accustomed to see with
nickel-plated instruments. This may be due to the compression into the grooving of the rifle,
or as the result of passing impact of the bullet with an obstacle previous to entering the
body or contact with a bone within it. Small scales of metal set free in one of these ways
are seen in a very large proportion of Mauser wounds, and although they are so small as usually
to be of little importance, the presence of such in, for instance, the substance of one of
the peripheral nerves which has been perforated cannot be considered a desirable complication.

To recapitulate, it would appear that at mean ranges, both in striking force and as regards
the area of the tissues affected, the Lee-Metford is a superior projectile to the Mauser, in
spite of the greater initial velocity possessed by the latter. On the other hand the comparative
ease with which the Mauser bullet undergoes deformation either without or within the body,
so ensuring more extensive injury and laceration, renders it the less desirable bullet to receive
a wound from when not in its normal shape and condition.

I can say little about the remaining two rifles. The Krag-Jörgensen was little used, and beyond
pointing out its capacity to inflict very neat individual injuries, in which it must surpass
even the Mauser, I can only add that I had no opportunity of forming an opinion as to the danger
dependent on the great initial velocity imparted to the bullet. The Guedes rifle has been included
in the table because it approximates in bore to the other three. Its bullet is of the same
calibre as the Austrian Mannlicher, one of the most powerful military rifles in use, and it
was used to a considerable extent during the war by the Boers.[8] As to its capabilities, it
appeared an inferior weapon, since want of velocity and striking power of the bullets was indicated
by the number of these which were retained in the body, and by the fact that I never saw one
extracted that had undergone any more serious deformation than some flattening on one side
of the tip. On the other hand wounds of the soft parts occasioned by it were only to be distinguished
from Mauser wounds by their slightly greater size, and at a short range of fire the weight
and volume of the bullet made it a dangerous projectile.

The question of deformed bullets will be again referred to at length in the section on wounds
of irregular type, and a number of type specimens are there figured and described (p. 76).
In the same chapter will be found illustrations of a number of sporting bullets of small calibre,
as well as of large calibres in lead, found in the Boer arsenals and camps. I have placed them
in that position as mainly of interest in connection with the occurrence of large and irregular
wounds (see figs. 42 and 43, pp. 95 and 98).

The small sporting bullets were mostly of the Mauser (.276), Lee-Metford (.303), or Mannlicher
(.315) calibre.

CHAPTER III

GENERAL CHARACTERS OF WOUNDS PRODUCED BY BULLETS OF SMALL CALIBRE

The effects of injuries inflicted by bullets of small calibre may be divided into two classes:

1. Direct or immediate destruction of tissue.

2. Remote changes induced by the transmission of vibratory force from the passing projectile
to neighbouring tissues or organs.

Those of the first class will be mainly considered in this chapter; the remote effects will
be dealt with under the headings devoted to special regions.

In dealing with the wounds as a whole I shall first describe those of uncomplicated character
as type injuries, and deal with those possessing special or irregular characters separately.

TYPE WOUNDS

1. Nature of the external apertures.--The apertures of entry and exit in uncomplicated cases
are very insignificant, but the size naturally varies slightly with that of the special form
of bullet concerned. As will be shown moreover, the difference in size is the only real distinguishing
characteristic in many cases between wounds produced by the modern bullet of small calibre
and those resulting from the use of the older and larger projectiles of conical form. I have
been very much struck on looking over my diagrams of entry, and especially exit, wounds to
find that they reproduce in miniature most of those figured in the History of the War of the
Rebellion; some of these diagrams are reproduced in this chapter.

Aperture of entry.--The typical wound of entry with a normal undeformed bullet varies in appearance
according to whether the projectile has impinged at a right angle or at increasing degrees
of obliquity, or again, to whether the skin is supported by soft tissues alone, or on those
of a more resistent nature such as bone or cartilage.

When the bullet impinges at a right angle the wound is circular, with more or less depressed
margins, and of a diameter, corresponding to the size of the bullet occasioning it, from a
quarter to a third of an inch. The description 'punched out' has been sometimes applied to
it, but it would be more correct to reverse the term to 'punched in,' since the appearance
is really most nearly simulated by a hole resulting from the driving of a solid punch into
a soft structure enveloped in a denser covering. The loss of substance, moreover, in the primary
stage is not actually so great as appears to be the case, fragments of contused tissue from
the margin being turned into the opening of the wound track. The true margin therefore is not
sharp cut, and the nature of the line differs somewhat according to the structure of the skin
in the locality impinged upon. Thus the granular scalp and the comparatively homogeneous skin
of the anterior abdominal wall will furnish good examples of the nature of the slight difference
in appearance. From the first the margin is also often somewhat discoloured by a metallic stain,
similar to that seen when a bullet is fired through a paper book. This ring is, however, narrow,
and not likely to be noticeable when the bullet has passed through the clothing. In any case
it is subsequently obscured by the development of a narrow ring of discoloration due to the
contusion. This latter varies in width, and still later a halo of ecchymosis half an inch or
more in diameter surrounds the original wound.

With increasing degrees of obliquity of impact more and more pronounced oval openings of entry
result, culminating in an actual gutter such as is seen in fig. 17.

In all oval openings the loss of substance is more pronounced at the proximal margin, while
the wound is liable to undergo secondary enlargement at the distal margin, since in the former
the epidermis is mainly affected, while in the latter the epidermis is spared as an ill-nourished
bridge, the deeper layers of the skin suffering the more severely. When the wound occurs in
regions, such as the chest-wall or over the sacrum, where the skin is firmly supported, the
oval openings are often very considerable in size, reaching a diameter at least double that
of the circular ones. In the case of the oval openings the depression of the margins is not
such a well-marked feature as in wounds resulting from rectangular impact of the bullet, since
the distal margin is really lifted.

Aperture of exit.--The wound of exit in normal cases offers far more variation in appearance
than that of entry, this variation depending on several circumstances: first, the want of support
to the skin from without, and such other factors as the degree of velocity retained by the
travelling bullet, the locality of the opening, and the density, tension, and resistance offered
by the particular area of skin implicated.

When the range has been short and the velocity high, it is often difficult to discriminate
between the two apertures. Both may be circular and of approximately the same size, and the
only distinguishing characteristic, the slight depression of the margin of the wound of entrance,
may be absent if any time has elapsed between the infliction of the injury and examination
by the surgeon. One very strong characteristic if present is the general tendency of the margins,
and even the area surrounding the exit wound itself, to be somewhat prominent. Fig. 16 shows
this point, although the wound from which it was drawn had been produced thirty-six hours before
death. The specimen was then hardened in formalin and still preserves its original aspect.
This character is, however, more frequently displayed in wounds received at mean, or longer,
ranges. In wounds produced by bullets travelling at the highest degrees of velocity it is often
absent.

When the range of fire has been greater and the velocity retained by the bullet lower, slit
wounds are common, or some of the slighter degrees of starring. Actual starring I never saw,
but reference to figs. 20 and 21 will show a tendency in this direction, also a close resemblance
to the starred wounds resulting from perforations by large leaden bullets. Such wounds, I believe,
are usually the result of a somewhat low degree of velocity.

Slit exit wounds may be vertical or transverse (fig. 20) in direction, and the production of
these is dependent on the locality in which they are situated, the thickness, density, and
tension of the skin, and the nature of the connection of the latter with the subcutaneous fascia
in the locality. Thus in wounds of different parts of the hairy scalp, so little variation
exists in the relative density and structure of the skin, that, in spite of the want of external
support at the aperture of exit, it is often difficult to discriminate offhand the two apertures,
if neither bone nor brain débris occupies that of exit.

If, however, a wound crosses from side to side a region such as the thigh where well-marked
differences exist in the subjacent support, thickness, and elasticity of the skin implicated
in the apertures, the wound of entry, if in the thick skin of the outer aspect, was usually
circular, while the exit in the thin elastic skin of the inner aspect was either slit-like
or starred. The difficulty in laying down any general rule as to the occurrence of circular
or slit apertures of exit in any definite region is, however, great, as may be seen by reference
to the accompanying diagrams taken from two patients wounded at Paardeberg (figs. 22 and 23).

In fig. 22 the bullet entered the outer and posterior aspect of the left buttock, crossed the
limb behind the femur, and emerged at the inner aspect by a vertical slit: the bullet then
entered the scrotum by a vertical slit, and emerged by a typical circular aperture; re-entered
the right thigh by a transverse slit aperture, and, striking the femur in its further course,
underwent deformation, and finally escaped by an irregular aperture 3/4 of an inch in diameter.
The occurrence of exit slits in the adductor region is common, and to be explained by the tendency
of the comparatively thin elastic skin to be carried before the bullet; the slit entry in this
position must, I suppose, be explained by the comparatively slight support afforded by the
underlying structures, which are often in a condition of hollow tension. The scrotal wounds
are perhaps more difficult to account for, but in this case the fact of the distal aperture
being directly supported by the right thigh is a ready explanation of the circular exit, while
the skin corresponding to the slit entry was no doubt carried before the bullet, and finally
gave way in the line of a normal crease.

In fig. 23 all the wounds are circular except the final exit, which was irregular as a result
of the bullet in this case also having struck the femur in the second thigh. Considerable variation
also exists in the size of the circular apertures; this illustrates the secondary enlargement
often occurring in such wounds, and most marked at the apertures of entry, as the more contused.
Both diagrams were made from patients eight days after the reception of the wounds.

Lastly, vertical or transverse slits may be looked for with considerable confidence in situations
in which transverse oblique or vertical folds or creases normally exist in the skin, and depend
on the lines of tension maintained by the connection of the skin in these situations to the
underlying fascia. Thus I saw well-marked transverse and vertical slits in the forehead corresponding
with the creases normally found there, and in this situation I noted some slit entries. Transverse
slits were common in the folds of the neck, the flexures of the joints (fig. 20), and the anterior
abdominal wall either in the mid line or in creases like those stretching across from the anterior
superior iliac spines. Again they were seen in the palms and soles, but here more readily tended
to assume the stellate forms. Vertical slits are less common; they occurred with the greatest
frequency in the posterior axillary folds.

Oval apertures of exit are far less common than those of entry, since the most common factor
for the production of an oval opening, bony support, is never present. In long subcutaneous
tracks, or very superficial wounds, they are however sometimes met with and may terminate in
a pointed gutter (see figs. 18 and 24).

The greatest modifications in the appearance and nature of the apertures of entry are dependent
on previous deformation of the bullet, when all special characteristics are lost, and it becomes
impossible to form any opinion as to the type of bullet concerned. These modifications are
naturally far more common in the aperture of exit, since the bullet so often acquires deformity
in the body as the result of impact with the bones. Further remarks on this subject will be
found with the description and comparison of the various bullets on p. 81.

2. Direct course taken by the wound track.--This character primarily depends on the velocity
with which bullets of small calibre are made to travel, and on the small area of the tissues
upon which they operate. In this relation the degree of velocity retained by the bullet is
often of minor importance, provided it be sufficient to penetrate the body. Fired within a
distance of 2,500 yards there is little doubt that a bullet of the Lee-Metford, Mauser, or
Krag-Jörgensen types, passes straight between the apertures of entry and exit when these are
of the type outline, even when the bones are implicated. By reason of the small size of the
projectiles, their shape, and the spin and velocity transmitted to them, there is no reason
why at a sufficiently short range they should not traverse the body from the crown of the head
to the sole of the foot. The necessary conditions of position and distance for such an injury
are obviously not often obtained, but it may be pointed out that the Belgian Mauser rifle at
a distance of five yards is capable of driving a bullet 55 inches or nearly five feet into
a log of pine-wood. Many examples of long tracks will be referred to later, but the following
instances may be of interest in this relation. A bullet entering at the occipital protuberance
traversed the muscles of the neck, passed through the thoracic cavity, fractured the bodies
of the third and fourth and grooved the seventh and eighth dorsal vertebræ, grooved the seventh
and eighth and fractured the ninth and tenth ribs, traversed the muscles of the back and finally
lodged against the ilium; the whole length of this track measured some 25 inches. Again, at
the battle of Belmont a Mauser bullet entered the pelvis of a horse just below the anus, and
traversed the entire trunk before emerging from the front of the chest: it may be of interest
to mention that this animal was alive and moving about the next day, but I am sorry I can give
no further information regarding his fate.

The possibility of contour tracks travelling around the walls of the chest or abdomen has therefore
rarely to be considered, except in occasional instances where the bullet fired from a long
range has impinged against a bone and is retained in the body. The small volume of the bullets,
however, allows the production of very prolonged direct subcutaneous tracks in the body wall,
in positions where they would be manifestly impossible with projectiles of larger calibre.

Figs. 24 and 25 illustrate wounds of this nature. In the case figured in fig. 24 the bullet
entered over the third rib in a vertical line above the right nipple; it then coursed obliquely
down, crossing the seventh costal cartilage, and finally emerged 3 inches above the umbilicus.
Where the track crossed the prominence of the thoracic margin the skin was so thinned as to
undergo subsequent discoloration, while a distinct groove was evident there on palpation. In
some similar cases I have seen the central part of the track secondarily laid open as a result
of the thinning of the skin and consequent sloughing due to the interference with its vitality.

Short of sloughing, the skin may show signs of alteration of vitality for a long period after
the injury; thus fig. 25 depicts the condition seen in a superficial wound of the thigh five
weeks after the injury. The line of passage of the bullet between the two openings was still
clearly visible as a dark red coloured streak. Grooves in such cases are generally readily
palpable in the early stages, while later the want of resistance is replaced by the readily
felt firm cord representing the cicatrix. These points are of much importance in discriminating
between perforating and non-perforating wounds of the abdomen, and are again referred to in
that connection.

The direction of the tracks obviously depends on the attitude assumed by the patient at the
moment of impact of the bullet and the direction whence the firing has proceeded. The frequent
assumption of the prone position during the campaign led to the occurrence of a large proportion
of longitudinal tracks in the trunk, or trunk and head, which will be referred to later. Certain
battles were in fact strongly characterised by the nature of the wounds sustained by the men.
Thus at Belmont and Graspan, where some rapid advances were made in the erect attitude, fractured
thighs were proportionately numerous, while at Modder River, where many of the men lay for
a great part of the day in the prone position, glancing wounds of the uplifted head, of the
occipital region, or longitudinal tracks in the trunk and limbs were particularly frequent.
I very much regret that the material at my disposal does not allow me to add some remarks as
to variation in the nature of the wounds according to whether they were received from an enemy
firing from a height or from below, but it is possible that some information on this subject
may be forthcoming when the returns of the Service are made up, since it is naturally of great
importance as to the effect of trajectory in the proportionate occurrence of hits.

3. Multiple character of the wounds.--The same conditions responsible for the length and directness
of the tracks, account for the frequently multiple character of the wounds implicating either
the limbs or viscera--thus, lung, stomach, liver; neck, thorax, abdomen; abdomen, pelvis, thigh.
Also for the frequent infliction of two or more separate tracks by the same bullet--thus, arm
and forearm with the elbow in the flexed position; both lower extremities; both lower extremities,
penis or scrotum; leg, thigh, and abdomen, with a flexed knee; upper extremity and trunk, and
more rarely one upper and one lower extremity. Again, it was remarkable how often the same
bullet would inflict injuries on two or more separate men, not unfrequently dealing lightly
with the first and inflicting a fatal injury on the second, or vice versâ. The small calibre
of the bullet, moreover, allows of the neatest and most exact multiple injuries. Thus in a
patient who was crawling up a kopje on all fours, the flexed middle digit of the hand was struck.
The bullet entered at the base of the nail, first emerged at the distal interphalangeal flexor
fold, re-entered the metacarpo-phalangeal fold, and finally emerged from the back of the hand
between the third and fourth metacarpal bones.

4. Small 'bore' of the tracks, and tendency of the injury to be localised to individual structures
of importance.--Here we meet with the most striking characteristic of the injuries, and evidence
that reduction of calibre affects more strongly the nature of the lesion than does any other
element in the structure of the modern rifle. The diameter of the track slightly exceeds that
of the external apertures, probably as a result of the more ready separability of the elements
of the structures perforated than exists in the skin. The calibre, moreover, tends to be fairly
even throughout when soft structures only are implicated, though local enlargements result
wherever increased resistance is met with. Thus a strong fascia may offer such resistance as
to increase locally the bore of the track, and in this particular the state of tension of the
fascia when struck will affect the degree of the enlargement. The most striking instances of
local enlargement of the track are of course seen when a bone lies in the course of the bullet,
but we must here bear in mind the introduction of a new element--the propulsion of comminuted
fragments together with the bullet itself. In cases of fracture the distal portion of the track
is in consequence many times larger than the proximal. The most striking examples of small
even tracks are seen, on the other hand, in punctures of the elastic and practically homogeneous
lung tissue, where the wounds are extremely small.

On transverse section of the track the gross amount of actual tissue destruction occupies a
lesser area than that corresponding to the diameter of the bullet. The destructive action of
the projectile is in fact exerted mainly on the tissues directly lying in its course, the track
being opened up during the rush of the passage of the bullet, partly as a result of its wedge-like
shape and partly as a result of the throwing off of the tissues forming the walls of the track
by a diversion of a portion of the force in the form of spiral vibrations dependent on the
revolution of the bullet. Again, the opening out of the tissues may be aided by the direction
taken by the first and strongest as well as the simplest series of vibrations transmitted,
which would assume the shape of a cone of which the point of impact forms the apex.

The escape from actual destruction by structures lying in the immediate neighbourhood of the
track is indeed often surprising, but not perhaps so astonishing as the perforation of long
narrow structures such as the peripheral nerves and vessels, without irreparable damage to
the parts remaining, and this although the structures themselves may be of a diameter not exceeding
that of the bullet itself. The capacity of these projectiles to split such structures as tendons
was already well known before our experience in this campaign, but the injuries to the nerves
and vessels of the same character came as a surprise to most of us. The lateral displacement
of tissues seems to bear a strong resemblance to what is seen on the passage of an express
train, when solid bodies of considerable weight are displaced by the draught created without
ever coming into contact with the train itself. The tendency to lateral displacement is still
more strongly exhibited when dense hard structures such as bone are implicated. Here the fragments
at the actual points of impact on the proximal and distal surfaces of a shaft are driven forwards,
while the lateral walls of the track in the bone are simply comminuted and pushed on one side
without loss of continuity with their covering periosteum.

The extension of this form of displacement to a degree amounting to a so-called explosive character
in the case of the soft tissues, even when the bullet passed at the highest degrees of velocity,
was, however, never witnessed by me, and I very much doubt the existence of a so-called 'explosive
zone' so far as wounds of the soft parts are concerned. On the contrary, I am inclined to believe
that the highest degrees of velocity are favourable to clean-cut neat injuries of the soft
tissues. I saw a large number of type wounds of entry and exit inflicted at a range of under
fifty yards.

5. Clinical course of the wounds.--The tendency of simple wounds such as are above described
to run an aseptic course was very marked, and, given satisfactory conditions, deep suppuration
and cellulitis were distinctly rare. It may also be confidently affirmed that when suppuration
did occur, with apertures of entry and exit of the normal small type, this was always the result
of infection from the skin, or infection subsequent to the actual infliction of the wound.
The infrequency of suppuration depended on the aseptic nature of the injury, the smallness
of the openings, the small tendency of the track to weep and furnish serous discharge in any
abundance, the comparative rarity of the inclusion of fragments of clothing or other foreign
bodies, and possibly in some degree on the purity and dryness of the atmosphere, which favoured
a firm dry clotting of the blood in the apertures of entry and exit, and consequent safe 'sealing
of the wound.'

As to the aseptic nature of the injury, it will be well to first consider the question of the
sterility of the bullet. Putting laboratory experiments on one side, the large experience of
this campaign seems to prove to absolute demonstration that, bearing in mind the very large
proportion of instances of primary union in simple tracks, the surgeon has nothing to fear
on the part of the bullet itself. This is the more striking when we remember that these bullets
shortly before their employment were carried in a dirty bandolier, and freely handled by men
whose opportunities of rendering either their hands or implements aseptic were as bad as it
is possible to conceive.

Several explanations are to hand, but none of them conclusive. Two must, however, be shortly
considered. First, the surface of the bullet, except its tip and base, is practically renewed
by passage through the barrel. Secondly, there is the question of the heat to which it is subjected.
As far as cauterisation of the tissues is concerned, this question has been practically settled
in the negative, since actual determinations of the heat immediately after the moment of impact
have been made, and again it has been shown that butter is not melted, and that neither gunpowder
nor dynamite is exploded, by firing bullets through small quantities of those materials. Again,
the absence of any sign of scorching of the clothes of the wounded is strong evidence against
the possibility of any considerable heat being applied to the tissues of the body; while another
observation, although of less importance as affecting spent bullets only, that bullets, which
have perforated the body but lie between the skin and the clothing, leave no sign of cauterising
action on either, may be mentioned. None the less, the sources of heating while the bullet
is passing from the barrel are many and obvious. Thus there is the heat consequent on explosion
of the powder, the warm state of the barrel itself when the rifle has been fired a few times
consecutively, and the heat resulting from the force and friction essential to the propulsion
of the bullet through the barrel. Again, bullets covered with wax before their introduction
into the barrel retain no trace of this when they have been fired, although at any rate the
portion covering the tip is not exposed to friction on the part of the rifle, and lastly the
base of the bullet has no other explicable reason for its innocuousness than subjection to
a certain degree of heat. While not claiming any cauterising action on the tissues by the bullet,
I should therefore still be inclined to allow the probability of the heat to which the surface
of the bullet is exposed exerting a cleansing action on the projectile. In regard to this point
it is interesting to bear in mind that shots from an ordinary gun seldom or never give rise
to infection.

Foreign bodies were rarely carried into the wounds with the bullet. I saw several instances
in which portions of the metal of cigarette cases and of cartridge cases when the bullet had
perforated cartridges in the wounded man's bandolier, and in one instance small pieces of glass
from a pocket mirror, must have been carried in without any obvious ill effect. Fragments of
clothing, on the other hand, in every case caused suppuration: clothing was not often carried
in, the khaki linen was perforated with a clean aperture, most commonly a slit; but the thick
woollen kilts of the Highlanders, and thick flannel shirts, occasionally furnished fragments.
The introduction of large pieces of clothing is a sure proof of irregularity of impact on the
part of the bullet. The frequency with which portions of cloth were introduced from the kilt
was one of the strongest surgical objections to its retention as a part of the uniform on active
service.

Retained bullets themselves remained as foreign bodies in a certain number of cases. I cannot
say that suppuration never followed the retention of a bullet, since in two of the instances
where I saw such removed they lay in a small cavity containing at any rate a 'purulent fluid.'
In one of these the bullet was a Martini-Henry, and in both the bullet had been imbedded for
some weeks, and had certainly not occasioned a primary suppuration of the wound.

The favourable influence of the pure and dry nature of the atmosphere in this campaign must
certainly not be underrated, and in support of this influence I think I may say, from the experience
of cases that I saw coming from Natal where the climate and surroundings were not so favourable
as on the western side, that suppuration was more common and more severe in the moister atmosphere.

Putting aside all the above remarks, however, I am inclined to think that a general tendency
to primary union and the absence of suppuration will always be a feature of wounds from bullets
of small calibre, and that this favourable tendency is attributable to certain inherent characters
of the injuries. Of these the nature and small size of the openings, the dry character of the
lining of the track due to superficial destruction and condensation of the tissue forming its
wall, the small disposition to prolonged primary hæmorrhage, and the absence of any great amount
of serous exudation during the early stages of healing are the most important.

A mechanical factor of great importance also exists in the spontaneous collapse and automatic
apposition of the walls of the track. This closure is rendered additionally effective in many
cases by the interruption of the continuous line in the wounded tissues consequent on alteration
in the position of the parts traversed when an attitude of rest is assumed by the injured part.
The indisposition to suppuration and the apparent unsuitability of the tissue lining the track
for the development and spread of infecting organisms are well illustrated by several observations.
Thus, even if the bullet be thoroughly aseptic, the fragments of destroyed skin driven into
the track by the bullet can scarcely be free from organisms; yet these seldom give rise to
trouble. Again, if for any reason a deep portion of a track becomes infected and suppurates,
there is no tendency for the spread of infection along the line of wounded tissue, but rather
for the development of a local abscess, pointing in the ordinary direction of least resistance,
irrespective of the course originally taken by the bullet.

Fig. 25 (a), A (plate I.) represents a section carried across an aseptic aperture of entry.
The specimen was removed by Mr. Cheatle from a patient who died forty-eight hours after reception
of the injury. It shows well the small amount of gross destruction suffered by the subcutaneous
tissue, and the rapid repair which follows, since macroscopically the track is scarcely discernible.
Reference to plate I. shows the remarkable fact that even at this early date considerable progress
towards definite healing has occurred, and a thin layer of stratified epidermis covers the
original opening. The question may be raised whether the origin of this epidermal layer is
not in part a floating up of the margins of the main aperture.

During the course of healing some variation takes place in the appearance of the apertures,
especially that of entry. This, at first contracted, later becomes somewhat relaxed, while
in many cases a small halo of ecchymosis develops around it. The blood-clot occupying its centre
now contracts, the margins rapidly become approximated centripetally, and a small circular
dark spot only remains, which is later replaced by a small red cicatrix. The dark central spot
under these circumstances consists of the contused margin of the wound in the skin, and a small
proportion of blood-clot which finally comes away as a small dry scab. When slight local infection
occurs in place of simple contraction and dry scabbing, the process is prolonged, the contused
margin separates by granulation, the clot in the opening breaks down, and a small ulcer of
somewhat larger proportions than the original wound remains and takes some days to heal.

The aperture of exit in simple wounds of the soft parts sometimes heals even more rapidly than
that of entry, and if of the slit form may be almost invisible at the end of ten days or a
fortnight, actual primary union having taken place as after a simple small incision. Larger
or irregular exit apertures, however, take a longer period to close than entry wounds, and
this is most often observed when the bullet has undergone deformation within the body, or bone
fragments have been driven out with the bullet.

Fig. 25 (a), B (plate II.) represents a section of an infected exit aperture from a patient
who died seven and a half days after its infliction. Two main points of interest are at once
apparent: 1. The carrying forwards of the subcutaneous fat into the lips of the skin wound
by the bullet. This illustrates the manner in which lightly supported structures are carried
forward by the bullet, and throws some light on the mode by which vessels and nerves may escape
by a process of displacement. This figure may be compared with fig. 25 (b) which shows a tag
of omentum similarly carried forward by a bullet crossing the abdominal cavity and plugging
the exit wound. 2. The second feature of interest is the amount of hæmorrhage into the subcutaneous
tissue. In this respect the contrast between the exit and entry apertures is marked, since
in the latter hæmorrhage is scarcely apparent. The presence of such hæmorrhages is explained
by the same dragging action as the extrusion of the fat, and is of course dependent on consequent
rupture of small vessels. It is of importance as predisposing the exit wound to more easy infection,
and it accounts for the persisting subcutaneous induration more often detected beneath healed
exit than entry apertures. Again, it suggests that the presence of blood in the deeper parts
of the tracks may be the determining cause of the indurated cords often replacing them.

Pari passu with the closure of the external openings, healing of the track takes place, but
this is not always so rapid a process as is apparently the case. In many instances the closure,
and even definite healing, of the external wounds is complete long before the track has actually
healed, even though it be contracted up to complete closure as far as any cavity is concerned.
This is well seen in many cases in which the exit opening is large as a result of deformation
of the bullet, or the passage of bone splinters in conjunction with it; here, in spite of absence
of all suppuration, the track may remain patent for many weeks. This may point to infection,
but the tardiness in actual consolidation corresponds with what we are well acquainted with
in the case of all aseptic wounds when a slough has to separate or become absorbed, and it
is therefore only what might be reasonably expected when we remember that every such bullet
track is lined by a thin layer of damaged tissue.

When fully healed, the points of entry and exit are so insignificant as to be less obvious
than ordinary acne scars, and later are often hardly visible, but for a considerable period
they are often more palpable than apparent. This depends upon the induration of the line of
cicatrix corresponding to the course of the original track which is adherent to the two points.
The induration is indeed so marked as to occasionally give rise to the suspicion that a foreign
body such as a fragment of lead or of the mantle of the bullet has been enclosed during the
healing of the wound.

In the deeper portions of the tracks the extreme density of the cicatrix is a factor of great
prognostic importance, since if it implicates muscles, tendons, vessels, or nerves, impairment
of movement, circulatory disturbance, or signs of neuritis or nerve pressure are often witnessed.
Thus, for instance, a track traversing the calf, will more or less tie the whole thickness
of the structures perforated at one spot, and the apertures of entry and exit may be visibly
retracted when the muscles are put in action with consequent pain and stiffness to the patient.
Such pain and stiffness form some of the most troublesome after-consequences of many simple
wounds. It is remarkable for how long a period after the healing of the wound and resumption
of active duty the patients suffer from pain in and radiating from the locality of the wound,
when fatigued or suffering from stiffness from the prolonged retention of one attitude or exposure
to cold. The cords, however, eventually completely disappear, and the cicatrices become moveable.
The effects of secondary pressure on the vessels and nerves are considered under the headings
devoted to those structures.

Suppuration.--While the occurrence of deep suppuration or septic phlegmon was rare, local suppuration
of the apertures of entry and exit was seen in a considerable proportion of the wounds. This
was referable to infection from the skin itself, or to infection from without subsequent to
the infliction of the injury. Infection from the skin, difficult to obviate at all times, is
especially likely to occur in wounds the first dressing of which is often delayed, and which
happen to men sweating freely into clothes the condition of which is at least undesirable for
contact with a recent wound. Beyond this, the first dressing materials, removed from a soiled
tunic by possibly a comrade or a stretcher-bearer, are scarcely above reproach of the probability
of containing septic organisms themselves. Again, once applied, the exigencies of the situation
often necessitate an amount of movement fatal to the retention of the dressing over the wound,
and a second opportunity of infection arises before the patient comes into the hands of the
surgeon in the Field hospital.

The general tendency of such suppurations when they occurred in uncomplicated flesh wounds
was to remain superficial, either involving the contused margin of the cutaneous opening and
the plug of blood-clot occupying it, and resulting in a slight enlargement of the wound only,
or at most involving the subcutaneous tissue and not extending into the deep planes of the
trunk or limbs. In either case a slight delay in healing was the most serious result, while
constitutional signs of infection were either absent or of the slightest nature. The same indisposition
to spread by the track was equally noted when a deep portion became infected from, for instance,
the intestine in a belly wound.

Wounds of irregular type, however, such as those caused by ricochet bullets, or accompanying
severe fractures, or those caused by fragments of larger projectiles, often suppurated freely
in spite of exposure to no more unsatisfactory surrounding conditions than the wounds of small
bore. This appears to show conclusively that the first element in the general slight consequences
of small-bore wounds is their calibre, and, secondly, that increase of velocity on the part
of the bullet, while it in some measure compensates for the loss of volume in the projectile,
on the other hand reacts in favour of the wounded in so far as the injuries it effects on the
soft tissues are ill suited to the development of septic organisms in the parts.

Retained bullets.--These were met with more frequently than might have been expected, but I
can give no idea as to their proportional occurrence, since so many of the slighter injuries
never came under my observation. Experience, however, showed that the bullets of large calibre
and low velocity employed during the campaign were far more commonly lodged in proportion to
the frequency of their use. Thus I saw a considerable number of Martini-Henry, Snider, large
leaden sporting bullets, and shrapnel retained. Again, among the bullets of smaller calibre,
the Guedes 8-mm. bullet, which travels at a comparatively low rate of velocity and with moderate
spin, was far more frequently lodged than the Lee-Metford or Mauser in comparison with the
number of Guedes rifles in use.

Bullets of small calibre were, however, also retained with some degree of frequency, either
as the result of striking at a long range, or in such a direction as to need to traverse a
large segment of the body before escaping, or as striking large or several bones, or making
some irregular form of impact: the last was a not infrequent explanation of lodgment, especially
when a bone lay in the course of the track. Ricochet bullets naturally were especially likely
to be retained, both on account of the low velocity with which they often travel and the irregularity
of their surface with consequent loss of penetrating power.

WOUNDS OF IRREGULAR TYPE

Many of the wounds met with deviated so greatly in appearance and general characters from what
has been described above as to afford little or no evidence of having been inflicted by small-calibre
bullets, and before describing these it is necessary to give a short account of the circumstances
which are responsible for such departures from the common type. In the case of the wound of
entry, the simplest explanations are lateral impact on the part of the cylindro-conoidal projectile,
due to the position of the part struck or the direction in which the bullet has been fired,
wobbling on the part of the bullet due simply to loss of velocity and force in flight, or to
turning of the bullet by impact with an obstacle to its course (ricochet) which may amount
to actual reversal of the striking end. As a rule, in such cases the size of the aperture of
entry exceeds that of exit, and in a large proportion the bullet is retained within the body.

Of these explanations that of the 'wobble' needs some passing notice. In its simplest form
it depends merely on loss of velocity of flight on the part of the bullet, the centre of gravity
of which lies behind its middle; hence a tendency to turn over and over is acquired. As a result
of this, either the side of the tip, the side of the bullet, the side of the base, or the base
itself may form the portion of the projectile which comes into contact with the body. The tendency
to wobble is naturally greatly increased in ricochet bullets, since the contact, if lateral,
serves to check the spin on which the bullet depends for its flight on an axis parallel to
its long diameter. The first effect of wobbling is to increase the size and interfere with
the regularity of outline of the wound of entry; but it also acts in a more serious manner,
since the increase of the area of impact augments the resistance offered by the body; therefore
the degree of damage to the tissues is accentuated and becomes greater than it would be from
a bullet travelling at the same rate on its normal axis. Hence the wounds are both large and
severe, or if the velocity is very low, the projectile is especially likely to be retained.

Actual reversal of the bullet usually only slightly enlarges the aperture of entry, but injuries
to cancellous bone are apt to be more severe when the bullet enters in this manner, or again
it is often retained. I saw several such cases during the campaign.

Another form of wobble is suggested by Nimier and Laval,[9] of which I can offer no experience.
They suggest that, as rotation slows, the bullet may on impact wobble like a top before it
ceases to spin. Probably the power of penetration possessed by a bullet wobbling in this manner
would not be very great, but its effect would mainly be altered in the direction of an abnormal
increase in the size of the aperture of entry, or possibly in the degree of comminution in
fractures.

It is probable that some of the more serious wounds observed were merely the result of unusual
forms of impact with normal flight on the part of the bullet. The majority, however, depended,
in the case of the wound of exit, on deformation of the bullet within the body, or the propulsion
of bone fragments with it, and, when both apertures were affected, to previous ricochet on
the part of the projectile.

It is here necessary to give a short account of the more common deformities met with, and to
refer to the special characters possessed by different types of bullet of small calibre which
may affect the ease with which deformity is produced, and the degree to which it is commonly
carried. The effect of ricochet is to lower the velocity of flight, and at the same time to
effect certain alterations of form in the bullet. These with rectangular impact in the case
of bullets travelling at a low degree of velocity consist in a bending and deformation of the
tip; in the higher degrees, of bending, shortening, extensive destruction, or complete fragmentation.
If the bullet makes lateral impact, only widening and flattening result, often with the escape
of the lead core from the mantle. That a ricochet bullet may travel a considerable distance
is shown by the following observations quoted from Nimier and Laval.[10]

Up to a distance of 1,700 to 1,800 metres the bullet may make several ricochet bounds. When
the bullet strikes first at short distances (as 600 metres), it may make several bounds of
from 300 to 400 metres: at moderate distances (as from 600 to 1,200 metres), bounds of 200
to 300 metres; and at distances above 1,200 metres, bounds of 100 to 200 metres. The length
of the ricochet bounds depends on the angle of impact of the bullet with the ground, the nature
of the slope of the latter, and the velocity of the bullet.

Putting aside the question of calibre and volume of the bullets we are concerned with, I believe
the most important variations as serious effects of ricochet depend on the relative thickness
and the composition of the mantles. Fig. 26 illustrates the relative thickness of the mantles
in the Krag-Jörgensen, Mauser, Lee-Metford, and Guedes bullets. Given an equal degree of force
and velocity on the part of the bullet at the moment of impact, the assumption is justifiable
that the thinner mantles would tear or burst more readily in direct ratio to their relative
thinness. I believe this assumption to be borne out by my own experience of the common deformities
that occurred; but the great relative frequency with which Mauser bullets came under my observation,
and the difficulty of forming any estimate of the velocity and force retained by any particular
bullet at the moment of impact, make it impossible for me to express myself with the confidence
which I should wish.

The second condition which influences the nature and degree of the deformities depends on the
relative tenacity or brittleness peculiar to the metal employed in the manufacture of the mantles.
In the case of the Lee-Metford this consists of an alloy of 80 parts of nickel with 20 of copper.
The Krag-Jörgensen and Mauser are ensheathed in steel plated with cupro-nickel, and the Guedes
has a plain steel envelope coated with wax.

Both as a result of experience in the field gained from ricochet bullets, and in the hospitals
from bullets which had undergone deformation within the body, I am under the firm impression
that the thin nickel-plated steel envelope of the Mauser bullet splits more readily than the
thicker and more tenacious cupro-nickel envelope of the Lee-Metford, that the direction of
the ruptures is more purely longitudinal, and the fissuring itself more extensive and complete.

I append below a series of deformities observed in Mauser bullets, some of which were collected
on the field of battle, but all of which were familiar to me in bullets removed from the bodies
of patients, except the complete disc shape shown in fig. 29. They correspond with specimens
of which I made sketches at the time of removal from the body, but which I had not the heart
to retain in view of the natural wish of the patients to keep them as mementoes of their wounds.

Slight indentations and deviations from strict symmetry of form of such degree as not seriously
to influence the outline and nature of the apertures were very common. Beyond these one of
the most frequent primary deformities was that we familiarly spoke of as the 'slipper form'
(No. 1, fig. 28). This results from light glancing contact of the tip with a hard body: in
it the mantle of the bullet is rarely fractured, and the deformity itself is of slight importance,
except in so far as it may influence the direction of the wound track, which acquires a tendency
to be curved. The tip of the bullet is slightly flattened and turned up, down, or to one side,
according to the point struck. I saw this deformity frequently, both with Lee-Metford and Mauser
bullets. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are more pronounced degrees of the same type of deformity, accompanied
by more or less extensive fissuring of the mantle. No. 4 illustrates the turning out of the
longitudinally fissured mantle in such a way as to make a cutting flange. I have seen such
bullets removed, and the variety is of some importance as materially increasing the cutting
capabilities of the bullet, and augmenting its area of destructive action. No. 5, fig. 29,
is the only form I have not seen removed, but such a bullet would account for some of the long
irregular gutter wounds observed, if it retained sufficient velocity to strike with any force.

Fig. 30 illustrates complete longitudinal fissuring of the mantle. Such mantles are common,
and still more so are the opened-out sheets such as is shown still attached in fig. 29. Free
mantles are often very numerous on stony ground, but are of little importance, since I never
saw fragments of them removed or impacted. They probably travel a very short distance after
their formation, and if they did strike would possess little power of penetration. The freed
leaden cores do, however, sometimes enter the body, and some of the specimens removed have
been referred to the use of expanding bullets. In all the Mauser specimens the longitudinal
direction of the fissuring of the mantle is striking.

Fig. 31 represents bullets removed from the body and illustrates types of deformity due to
impact with the bones. The deformity resembles in some degree that of the mushroomed lead cores,
and also indicates that the shoulder of the cased bullet is its weakest point. Each specimen
exhibits shortening and widening without fracture of the mantle, the latter being simply thrown
into folds; both bullets were lodged in the thigh after fracturing the femur. The localisation
of injury to the fore part of the bullet, and the fact of expansion, allow us to infer that
the degree of velocity retained on impact with the bone was comparatively low, and that neither
bullet had been exposed to very severe strain.

Fig. 32 is also of a retained bullet in which the fore part of the mantle is very extensively
fissured and the core set free. In this the mantle has suffered severely and the leaden core
to a less extent. As an apical ricochet it corresponds with the Lee-Metford shown in fig. 36.

The deformity found in fig. 32 I met with both in retained bullets and also in those which
had been fired into sand or anthills. The particular specimen figured was removed from the
thigh of a patient wounded at the battle of Belmont. An irregular entry wound was situated
over the internal tuberosity of the tibia, while a large fluctuating hæmatoma existed in the
lower third of the thigh, at the upper part of which a hard elongated body was palpable. As
was so often the case with internal hæmorrhages, the patient's temperature rose high, and on
the third day the hæmatoma was incised by Major Coutts, R.A.M.C. The core of the bullet was
then found in the blood cavity near the surface, but on introduction of the finger a second
body was discovered entangled in the quadriceps muscle, and this proved to be the tattered
mantle. I saw similar deformity produced within the body by a bullet, which, entering by a
small type aperture in the left ala of the nose, struck the margin of the right malar bone,
and lodged beneath the latter. The similarity of this bullet to that seen in the ricochet in
fig. 32 was exact. The form is of great importance both on account of the degree of laceration
it effects in the track, the presence of two foreign bodies in the wound, and from the fact
that it can be produced by making the bullet travel through sand or antheaps, since both the
former in the shape of sandbags and the latter in their natural state so often formed the cover
to men during the campaign. Bullets of 6.5 mm., such as the Krag-Jörgensen, with steel envelopes
apparently break up with great ease in sand.

Fig. 33 shows a form not uncommon when the bullet comes into contact with the ribs. It is produced
in bullets travelling at a low rate of velocity and striking by their side. I several times
met with it when the bullet was retained, and also without fracture of the rib. In some variety
it might occur after impact with any narrow margin of bone, and some importance attaches to
the form, since it affords evidence as to the ease with which alterations in symmetry can be
produced in Mauser bullets. Again its bent outline favours deviation in the further course
of the bullet subsequent to impact with the bone, a result which I observed on more than one
occasion.

Lastly, the question of actual spluttering or breaking up of the bullets must be considered.
It is extraordinary into how many fragments either a Lee-Metford or a Mauser bullet may break
up if it strike a hard body while travelling at a high rate of velocity. Fragmentation is exhibited
in the skiagram forming the subject of plate XI. p. 194. It is somewhat remarkable how often
this occurred when the short hard bones of the metacarpus were struck. With regard to the casing,
the separation of small scales of the nickel plating has already been referred to; reference
to the skiagrams, plates IX. and XVI., shows how readily the whole thickness of the mantle
breaks up into small fragments, even when the bullet is travelling at moderately low degrees
of velocity, and this I believe to be a special characteristic of the thin cupro-nickel-plated
steel mantles.

Any variety of cased bullet, however, when it strikes against a stone, hard ground, or a bone,
may be broken into innumerable fragments. The leaden fragments occasionally show a simple fractured
surface, such as is illustrated on a larger scale by the broken shrapnel bullets shown in fig.
96, p. 485. More commonly, however, the fragments, if of any size, appear torn, and if small,
are mere spicules. These if of lancet shape often bury themselves in the skin only, while larger
ones may penetrate deeply or even perforate. Thus, of a group of three officers standing near
a stone on which a bullet struck, all were spattered about the face; most of the fragments
lodged in the skin, but one perforated the concha of the ear and bruised the mastoid area,
while others caused small jagged cuts. In another instance, both thighs of the patient were
spattered after perforation of the clothes, and a large fragment lodged beneath the skin of
the penis. A case in which larger fragments perforated and simulated type wounds has already
been referred to on p. 44.

The above remarks apply, for the most part, to Mauser bullets only, because my experience of
that projectile was far wider than of the Lee-Metford. The only deformed Lee-Metford bullets
that I saw removed from the body were of the 'slipper' variety, exactly corresponding to the
similarly altered Mausers, and with no fissuring of the mantle. I saw none so freely deformed
as the Mausers depicted in figs. 28, 29, 31, and 32.

In spite of diligent search on several battlefields, I was unable to collect many forms of
Lee-Metford ricochet, although I found many undeformed bullets. I insert here, therefore, some
illustrations I obtained through the kindness of Colonel Hopton, Director of the School of
Musketry at Hythe, which are of interest, and in some degree substantiate the impression I
formed in South Africa as to the greater stability of the Mark II. Lee-Metford bullet (fig.
34). I am aware that, as meeting a smooth target at right angles, some of these are not strictly
comparable to the Mauser bullets forming the subjects of the preceding illustrations, which
struck stones, and these mainly by their sides (if we except figs. 31 and 32), but they sufficiently
exhibit the characters on which I wish to insist. That they support my opinion is the more
probable as, with the exception of the type included above, I am under the impression that
the large majority, if not all, of the Mauser bullets which struck stones fairly with their
tips were broken to pieces, otherwise I must have met with some among the immense number which
I saw. On the top of Tabanyama, for instance, the whole ground was littered at the time of
my visit with shattered mantles and leaden cores, deformed almost past recognition.

The specimens depicted in figs. 35 and 36 indicate--(1) a greater malleability on the part
of the mantle; thus in fig. 35 the cupro-nickel is obviously hammered and flattened out, while
the fissures are neither numerous nor extensive. (2) Both bullets exhibit transverse tearing
of the mantle, a common feature in Lee-Metford ricochets, of which I could offer other examples,
but which I less often observed in Mauser bullets. (3) Tear is the term best expressing the
nature of the fissures, while fracture more nearly expresses the nature of the fissures in
the Mauser mantles. (4) Fig. 36 shows a mushroomed core and split mantle, which may be compared
with the similarly deformed Mauser depicted in fig. 31. I think the variation in appearance
is characteristic, the fissuring of the mantle being much less extreme, while the leaden core
is normal at its base in consequence of the support afforded by the more tenacious cupro-nickel
mantle. With regard to complete splitting of the mantles, however, I must add that free Lee-Metford
mantles are often found from bullets fired at the target or elsewhere, and Nimier and Laval
figure numerous forms.[11]

Expanding bullets.--The wounds resulting from perforation with deformed regulation bullets,
such as are described above, differ for the most part by deviation from the type appearances,
and a tendency to take a less favourable course on account of their increased size and of the
greater degree of laceration of the tissues accompanying them. I must now pass on to the consideration
of the forms of bullet especially likely to occasion those wounds spoken of as 'explosive'
in character, and my remarks on these must be prefaced by a short description of the varieties
which were in use during the campaign.

These consisted in soft-nosed bullets of the Mauser and Lee-Metford patterns, Tweedie and Jeffreys
modifications of the Lee-Metford and Mauser, several soft-nosed bullets of a slightly larger
calibre, mostly old Mauser or Mannlicher types, and a large variety of sporting leaden bullets
of larger calibre and volume. Figs. 37 and 43.

With regard to the various soft-nosed bullets of small calibre, I will first advert to a feature
common to all, which consists in a solid base to the mantle. In the regulation whole-cased
bullets the leaden core is inserted from the base, and the edge of the mantle is then so turned
over for fixation purposes as to leave the central portion of the lead exposed. The position
of the exposed portion of the core is therefore reversed in the two varieties. The small experience
I had the opportunity of obtaining was all to the effect that the solid base considerably increases
the stability of the mantle, and I never saw the latter seriously torn in any specimen either
collected on the field or removed from the body.

Fig. 38, 1, represents a soft-nosed Lee-Metford removed from just below the lesser sigmoid
cavity of the ulna, after it had perforated the elbow-joint. The soft nose appears to have
been torn, and separated by impact with the bone, but the mantle is little altered. There can
be little doubt, however, that the bullet was travelling at a comparatively low rate of velocity,
since it was retained in the forearm, whence its various parts were removed by Major Lougheed,
R.A.M.C. I picked up a number of similarly deformed bullets on the field. No. 2 represents
a soft-nosed Lee-Metford which perforated the scapula from the front; the bullet was retained,
hence again velocity cannot have been very high, and the comminution was slight. If it had
passed out, a large exit wound would, however, have resulted.

Fig. 39 represents a type of ricochet sometimes found on the field. In spite of a considerable
amount of violence which has caused the escape of the core, the fissuring of the mantle is
comparatively slight. In point of fact, the casing is, as a rule, preserved from the severe
violence it suffers when complete, by the flattening and turning over of the soft nose. I am
sorry I cannot append an illustration of a damaged soft-nosed Mauser, but I am of opinion that
those used during the campaign were not of a very dangerous nature on account of the small
amount of lead exposed. To gain the full advantage of the soft nose at least a third of the
core should be exposed. No. 3, fig. 37, of a Lee-Metford, probably represents the most effective
form of such bullets. I am inclined to think these bullets as a class, however, are not more
dangerous to the wounded man than the regulation Mauser fired at short range, if the latter
either comes into contact with bone or suffers ricochet.

The Tweedie and Jeffreys bullets come under a somewhat different category. In the Tweedie the
top of the bullet is sawn off in such a manner as to flatten the tip and widen the surface
of direct impact, and to expose the leaden core over a small area. The general principle of
the flat tip resembles that of the French Lebel bullet. In the Jeffreys modification the mantle
is sawn down for about half the length of the whole mantle, the slits neither reaching tip
nor base. I seldom saw these bullets removed, but they were used to a considerable extent.
Fig. 40 illustrates one of Mauser calibre in the possession of Mr. Cuthbert S. Wallace. It
perforated the abdomen, producing fatal injuries, but the only alteration in outline consists
in slight bulging and shortening. This specimen, however, manifestly suffered but slight resistance.
A somewhat general impression existed that a number of severe injuries had been produced by
the Jeffreys bullets, but it was a matter of conjecture, as few of them were removed. A weekly
illustration appears in the advertisement sheet of the 'Field,' showing the deformity of some
of them shot into animals, which bear a strong resemblance to the Mauser figured earlier (fig.
31), and which we have seen can be produced in the human body by contact of a regulation fully
cased bullet with a bone like the malar. A tendency on the part of the longitudinal slits to
become caught in the rifling of the barrel militates against the use of this bullet.

Fig. 41 represents sections of the soft-nosed Mauser, and the British Mark IV. bullet, and
shows the different method of closure of the base. If the former remarks on the influence of
the closed base in maintaining the stability of the bullet be correct, Mark IV. should be a
very destructive bullet. I have no experience of its use, but I am inclined to think that here,
as elsewhere, the thickness and resistance of the cupro-nickel mantle would endow it with considerable
stability, unless it met with very great resistance.

In connection with the subject of soft-nosed bullets, I should mention that the Boers occasionally
extemporised various modifications of them, such as are shown in fig. 42, with intent to increase
the wounding power of the projectiles. I am unable, however, to give any information as to
the effects produced by these, and I do not think they were often employed. The illustrations
are from cartridges found in trenches which had been occupied for some time by the Boers, who
had no doubt used their spare time in exercising their ingenuity on the bullets.

'Explosive' bullets of small calibre were also said to have been employed; with regard to these
I can only say that I never met with any example of a hollow bullet containing explosive material.

One officer in a Colonial corps who spoke freely about them, told me he had 'sawn' them in
half and found the cavities, but the method of investigation he had employed seemed against
the presence of any fulminant in the body of the bullets. Others based their statements on
the fact that they had frequently heard the bullets burst in the air; but this is probably
to be explained by the breaking up of regulation bullets on impact with stones, which makes
a smart crack like a small explosion.

A clip of soft-nosed Mauser cartridges, in which a copper centre to the bullet suggested a
percussion-cap, was sent home to the War Office. Colonel Montgomery has kindly furnished me
with the following report on the bullet:

'The bullet contains no explosive matter, it is fitted with a hollow copper tube in the nose,
similar to the ordinary "Express" bullet. The envelope is made with a solid base, which is
possible in this bullet owing to the core being inserted from the front.'

One cannot help feeling some astonishment at the strong feeling that has been exhibited regarding
the use of expanding bullets of small calibre, both at the Hague Conference and during this
campaign, when the Martini-Henry, a far more dangerous and destructive missile in its effects
at moderate ranges, is allowed to pass muster without notice.

Lastly, we come to bullets of large calibre unprovided with a mantle. The Martini-Henry is
practically representative of all these, but I append a photograph of some twenty out of thirty
varieties which came into my possession during searches amongst captured ammunition. Some of
these were provided with a copper core to facilitate 'setting up,' others were cupped at the
top, and others flattened, to increase the resistance on impact. I can say little about them
except that I believe some of the forms were responsible for a considerable proportion of the
most severe injuries we met with, in some of which a large and regular entry made their use
certain, while a considerable proportion of them were retained. In the case of the viscera
their power of doing serious damage was very striking compared with that of the bullets of
small calibre. As with the small sporting bullets I think their use was often due to the fact
that the sporting Boer preferred to use the weapon he was accustomed to rather than his military
weapon.

A considerable number of the Boers were armed with Martini-Henry rifles, and this was particularly
the case with small bodies of men, rather than with the larger commandos fighting regular engagements.
The Transvaal Government, moreover, had Martini-Henry rifles made as late as 1898. The Martini-Henry
bullet was responsible for some of the worst fractures that came under my notice, but it is
of interest to remark that its capability to do damage did not satisfy some of the Boers, who
cut them as is shown in fig. 43. I cannot say what the effect of this manoeuvre was, although
it may have accounted for some of the wounds of the calf such as are mentioned below.

Some odd missiles were met with during the campaign; thus, at Ladysmith, I was told ball bicycle
bearings were at one time in use amongst the Boers.

Anatomical characters of wounds of irregular type.--It will be seen from the above that in
dealing with wounds of irregular type we have to consider those due to irregular impact of
normal regulation bullets, to bullets deformed by contact with bone, to ricochet bullets, and
lastly to bullets of the expanding type.

No further mention of those due to irregular impact is needful beyond what has already been
said under the heading of wobbling, except to point out that, given a fair degree of velocity,
these injuries may assume an actual explosive character, especially in the case of skull fractures.
The description of extensive wounds accompanying comminuted fractures finds its most appropriate
place under the heading of injuries to the bones, and will be there considered (Chapter V. p. 155).

'Explosive' exit apertures are, however, described as occasionally occurring in injuries involving
the soft parts only. I saw no cases substantiating this belief, but several were described
to me as having been met with in abdominal injuries, which terminated fatally at an early date.

I still, however, incline to the opinion that the bullet in these cases had come into contact
with some bone, or was one of the larger varieties of projectile. A few cases of wound of the
calf did, however, come under my observation which presented fairly typical 'explosive' characters
without evidence of solution of continuity of the bones. I will shortly recount two of them.
In the first the exit opening was very large and on the outer aspect of the limb in the upper
third. The bullet had apparently passed between the bones. Secondary hæmorrhage from the anterior
tibial artery necessitated exploration of the wound and ligature of the vessel (Mr. Carré).
When the wound was thus laid open no injury to the bones could be detected, but I do not consider
that it could be actually excluded. In the second case a wound traversed the calf transversely,
just above the centre; the exit aperture was large and ragged. Deep suppuration occurred, and
the wound had to be laid open, when a fracture of the tibia without solution of continuity
was discovered. I also saw one or two wounds of the buttock in which very large exit apertures
were present with small entry openings; in these again it was impossible to exclude passing
contact of the bullet with a part of the pelvic wall. Unfortunately in all these cases it is
impossible to obtain the bullet responsible for the injury. In this relation I append a diagrammatic
illustration of a peculiar wound shown to me by Mr. Hanwell. In this case a typical small entry
wound was situated at the outer margin of the left erector spinæ muscle in the loin. The bullet
had taken a subcutaneous course of not more than three-quarters of an inch, while the exit
opening was a long shallow wound measuring 4-1/2 in. in length by 1-1/2 in. width. (Fig. 44.)

The wound was stated to have been received at a distance of from fifty to a hundred yards.
I think we can scarcely assume that impact with the margin of the erector spinæ could have
resulted in 'setting up' of the bullet, while an irregular tongue of skin at the point where
the wound crossed the spines of the lumbar vertebræ did suggest possible bony contact. That
the latter must have been of the slightest nature is evident, as no signs of concussion of
the spinal cord were noted. I should rather be inclined to compare this case to one of gutter
wound quoted on p. 56, and to assume that the bullet passed so closely beneath the surface
as either to entirely sever the skin, or at any rate to allow it to give way on flexion of
the back on movement.

On the ground of the observations made in the foregoing pages it will be gathered that the
opinion I formed was against either the very free use or the great wounding power of so-called
expanding bullets of small calibre. I believe that a great number of the injuries which were
attributed to the employment of these missiles were produced either by ricochet regulation
bullets of small calibre, or by large leaden bullets of the Martini-Henry type.

Symptoms.--I very much doubt whether the general symptoms observed as the result of wounds
from bullets of small calibre differ in more than slight degree from those described when larger
bullets were regularly employed. Great variation was met with, but I do not think a diminution
in serious results in this direction corresponding to the comparatively limited nature of the
direct injury to the organs or tissues can be affirmed. It is true that the immediate symptoms
in many patients were amazingly slight, but after all, this has always been a feature of gunshot
injuries on the field of battle and cannot be assigned a position of distinctive importance.

1. Psychical disturbance and shock.--Some remarkable instances of psychical disturbance were
observed, and although perhaps in no way influenced by the calibre of the projectile, they
seem worthy of note in this place. Thus a patient wounded over the cervical spine and who suffered
later with a slight degree of spinal concussion emitted an involuntary shriek like that of
a wounded hare on being struck; another (Martini wound), after receiving a wound of the chest,
lost all sense of his surroundings for a considerable period, and occupied himself in attempts
to write on a white stone lying near him on the veldt; then suddenly realising his position
he was greatly bewildered in trying to account for his own action. A similar instance of preoccupation
is probably offered by the dead man in the accompanying photograph (fig. 45), whose arms, forearms,
and hands had evidently been in play until the actual moment of death. Again the influence
of the psychical state on the actual occurrence of shock was often illustrated by the mental
condition of the wounded after a battle; thus after the battles of Belmont and Graspan the
patients came into hospital in excellent spirits, and minimised their injuries in the wish
of rapidly regaining the front; while after the battle of Magersfontein the men were depressed
and miserable, shock was more pronounced, and their sufferings were undoubtedly greater.

On the whole, however, shock was by no means a prominent symptom in the small-bore injuries
of soft parts, and was possibly less than when larger bullets were the rule, and again it was
often remarkably slight after the infliction of serious visceral injury. Still shock was observed
in a considerable proportion of the patients, and its occurrence appeared to vary under very
much the same conditions as obtain in civil practice. Grades of severity depended on individual
idiosyncrasy, on the degree of excitement or preoccupation at the moment of injury, and to
a certain degree on the range of fire at which the injury was received.

The last is the only special factor, and as far as my observation went it was one of considerable
importance. When the soft parts only were affected, even high velocity did not produce much
effect; but when to a flesh wound a severe bone fracture or injury to any part of the nervous
system was added, shock might be severe or profound. The question of shock dependent on visceral
injury will be considered in succeeding chapters, but it may be well to state here that the
most severe shock appeared to follow injuries to the central nervous system especially to the
spinal cord, fracture of the larger bones, and wounds of the abdominal and thoracic viscera,
the latter especially when the cardiac neighbourhood was encroached upon: hence the severity
depended almost solely on the importance of the part injured and the degree of damage inflicted.
I never observed instances of entire absence of shock in visceral injuries, unless the range
of fire had been an especially long one.

To these remarks on constitutional shock I should add a few on the 'local shock' exhibited
by the actual part of the body struck. The phenomena were of a severity I was quite unacquainted
with in civil practice, and apparently were attributable to the local vibration transmitted
to the whole structure of a limb or part of the trunk. In many fractures, and in some wounds
of the soft parts alone, without the direct implication of any large nerve trunk, the loss
of functional capacity of the limb was complete, and this condition persisted for hours or
even days.

2. Pain.--As an initial symptom the occurrence of pain varied greatly with the idiosyncrasy
of the patient, and according to the circumstances under which the wound was received. Some
individuals are remarkably insensitive, and in these the fact of a wound being a gunshot injury
in no way altered their habitual insensibility, but in persons of what may be termed the normal
type in this particular great differences were observed.

When a wound was received in the full excitement of battle during a rapid advance, pain was
often slight, or so trifling in degree that it was almost unnoticed; many patients did not
realise that they had been struck until a second wound, possibly implicating a bone or some
specially sensitive structure, was superadded. In such instances the pain was often described
as 'burning' in character, or even likened to a 'sting from an insect.' Occasionally the pain
was referred to a distant part; thus a man struck in the head first felt pain in the great
toe, and another struck in the abdomen also felt pain in his foot only. Again in some multiple
injuries, pain was only felt in the more sensitive of the regions implicated; thus a patient
in whom a bullet (Martini) traversed the arm and chest emerging in the neck to again enter
the chin and comminute the mandible, only felt pain in the chin and first realised that he
had been wounded elsewhere when he undressed. A striking instance of the entire absence of
initial pain was afforded by a man shot through the buttock, the bullet then traversing the
abdomen: this patient remained unaware that he had been hit until on undressing he found blood
in his trousers and exclaimed: 'Why I have got this bloody dysentery!' None the less his internal
injuries were sufficiently severe to lead to death during the next thirty-six hours.

Although initial pain might be slight or absent, practically all the patients complained of
some of varying severity at the end of an hour after reception of the wound.

In a large proportion of the wounded, however, pain was more or less severe from the first,
and this was especially the case when the men had been exposed to fire for some hours behind
inadequate 'cover.' The most common descriptions under these circumstances were that they felt
as if they had been struck by 'a brick,' 'a ton of lead,' or 'a sledge-hammer.'

3. Hæmorrhage.--This question is fully treated under the heading of injuries to the blood-vessels.
It will suffice here to say that hæmorrhage was rarely of a dangerous nature so far as life
was concerned, unless the large visceral vessels or those in the walls of serous cavities were
concerned, when death was often rapid. From limb wounds, even when the largest trunks were
implicated, the general tendency was to spontaneous cessation of the hæmorrhage. Consequently,
except these patients were seen on the field, one seldom had to deal with serious bleeding.
None the less, the condition of the patients' clothes bore testimony to a free rush immediately
after the injury, and pools of blood were occasionally found where patients had lain. In nearly
all cases the rush of the bullet determined the initial flow of the blood from the exit wound,
and this aperture usually furnished any hæmorrhage of importance.

Diagnosis.--The only diagnostic point which it is necessary to consider in this chapter is
the determination of the nature of the bullet which has caused the particular injury under
observation, and this is more a matter of interest than importance.

The primary indication lies in the size of the aperture of entry, which naturally varies with
the calibre of the bullet employed, and the difference, except in the case of large projectiles,
is not always easily determined, unless we can be sure that the impact of the bullet was at
right angles. In the latter case it is possible to distinguish even between, for instance,
a Lee-Metford and a Mauser wound, if the resistance likely to be offered by the part struck
is kept in mind. A ricochet bullet, on the other hand, may upset all our calculations, if size
alone be taken as an indication; but here the irregularity of the wound often serves to exclude
one of the larger varieties as the cause. The appearances of the exit wound are less useful
in determining the nature of the bullet employed, as irregularities of outline are so much
more common whatever projectile may have emerged; but examination of this wound often gives
us useful information as to the existence of an injury to the bones not involving loss of continuity.

Other information beyond that furnished by the external wounds may be gleaned from the presence
of fragments of lead in the wound; these, if unaccompanied by portions of casing, afford some
presumptive evidence of the use of an unsheathen bullet, especially if found on the fractured
surface of the bones; but it must be borne in mind that in the case of ricochet bullets the
leaden core often perforates when entirely freed from its mantle. Pieces of the mantle again
may give useful information both from examination of their thickness and composition. Lastly
a naked core nearly always retains the marking on its base corresponding to the turning over
of the mantle, this not being likely to suffer impact calculated to efface the groove. When
this groove existed the employment of any of the soft-nosed bullets used in this campaign might
be safely excluded (fig. 46).

Prognosis.--The question of general mortality amongst the wounded has already been considered
(Chapter I. p. 11), and it has been shown, putting aside those dying at once on the field,
or during the first twenty-four hours, that the mortality was a low one. Some other points
specially dependent on the nature of the injury are, however, worthy of mention in this place.
First, it has been shown, with a slight reservation as to when a wound can be considered definitely
sound, that if suppuration did not occur, healing was rapid, and that many men with slight
wounds were back with their regiments in the course of a very few days. Again, that suppuration
when it did occur tended to be local in character; none the less, if it was at all extensive,
it often proved very prolonged and difficult of treatment, while residual abscesses after apparent
healing were not uncommon. In connection with this subject I may quote from Colonel Stevenson[12]
an observation that limbs the subject of marked local shock are especially liable to furnish
septic discharges. Parts the subject of local shock when infected show a lesser degree of vitality
and power of resistance to the spread of infection than do normal ones, and if infected do
badly. I think I convinced myself of this on many occasions, and also of the fact that cases
of fracture in which this condition was marked were slow in consolidating. Again I am inclined
to think that the bad results which sometimes followed the tying of the limb arteries were
also consequent on lowered vitality, and possibly vaso-motor disturbance due to the effects
of the exquisite vibratory force to which the nerves had been subjected. On this account I
was never anxious to hurry operations in such cases, unless obviously necessary at the moment.

The larger question of general nervous breakdown as the result of injuries from bullets of
small calibre is at present hardly capable of an answer, and is so complicated by the co-existence
of concurrent mental anxiety, exposure, &c., that a definite answer will always be difficult.
I think there is already sufficient evidence, however, to suggest that the remote effects of
many of these injuries may be far more serious than we expected at the moment, especially in
the direction of sclerotic changes in the nervous system.

Treatment.--In view of the remarks on the treatment of special injuries contained in succeeding
chapters, I shall confine myself here to the question of the treatment of wounds of the soft
parts alone.

This consisted during the campaign in the primary application of the regulation first field
dressing by one of the wounded man's comrades, an orderly, or less commonly an officer or a
medical man. This dressing is composed of a piece of gauze, a pad of flax charpie between layers
of gauze, a gauze bandage 4-1/2 yards long, a piece of mackintosh water-proof, and two safety
pins, enclosed in an air-tight cover. Mr. Cheatle,[13] in insisting on the importance of an
immediate antiseptic dressing in the field, recommends the following. A paste contained in
a collapsible tube, made up in the following proportions: Mercury and zinc cyanide grs. 400,
tragacanth in powder gr. 1, carbolic acid grs. 40, sterilised water grs. 800; sufficient bicyanide
gauze and wool for the dressing of two wounds, a bandage, and four safety pins; the whole enclosed
in a mackintosh bag. The paste possesses the advantage over any liquid or powder, that it can
be applied in any position of the body to severe wounds, and its application in the open air
is not interfered with by draughts of wind. Mr. Cheatle used a similar preparation with success
during the campaign.

On arrival at the Field hospital, or in some cases at the station of the bearer company, the
wounds were then commonly dressed as follows: The parts around the wound were cleansed with
an antiseptic lotion, either solution of perchloride of mercury 1 in 1,000, or 2-1/2 per cent.
solution of carbolic acid. The wound itself was then cleansed, and a dressing of double cyanide
of mercury and zinc applied. This was covered with a pad of wool and secured with a bandage.
The gauze was usually wrung out in the lotion before application as a precaution against previous
contamination, and the moistening was also useful as helping to ensure the dressing from subsequent
displacement. It was early recognised that the drier the dressing the better, and hence anything
like a mackintosh layer was carefully avoided. In some instances, antiseptic powders were employed,
but they did not find much favour, and because they tended to favour slipping of the dressing,
and to prevent the adhesion of the gauze dressing to the wound, they were certainly not desirable
when there was any necessity for the patient to travel. In the absence of reliable water the
use of antiseptic lotions was obligatory, and such is likely to be the case in most campaigns;
in the present one, filtration of the thick muddy water was impossible, without a considerable
expenditure of time, which could only be obtained when the hospitals were fairly stationary.
I very much preferred carbolic acid lotions.

The wound having been once cleansed, or rather the surroundings of the wound, the drier the
surface was kept the better; hence a too heavy or impervious dressing was not satisfactory;
in point of fact, I think some of the slighter wounds in which all the dressings slipped off,
and in which there was less consequent chance of the dressing being moistened with the sweat
of the patient, did as well as any.

I do not think the bicyanide gauze, absorbent wool, and common open-wove bandages, together
with a good supply of nail brushes, soap, and carbolic acid for the primary disinfection of
the skin and the external wound, are to be greatly bettered at the present day as materials
for the first permanent dressing of cases in the field. The wound itself should be carefully
shielded during the preliminary cleansing of the skin by a firmly applied antiseptic pad, and
then the dressing applied as above described. The one desirable improvement is some mode of
ensuring the dressing being kept in good position, and for this some form of adhesive covering
for the gauze and wool should be devised. When the atmosphere is such as to allow of rapid
drying, thin moistened book-muslin bandages would be preferable to the plain open-wove ones.
The one period of danger is that of transport, and when that is over, the dressing in Stationary
or Base hospitals should give no trouble.

As a rule the wounds themselves need no interference, but in some instances either the exit
or entrance wounds may be in undesirable positions for purposes of asepsis, when a large opening
may seem safer closed and actually sealed. I saw this method tried in a few cases, but without
much success. It is one which might be of much use in Base hospitals if the patients were brought
directly into them, but in the Field hospitals, in face of the rush with which the first dressings
have to be done, I think it is seldom applicable, and consider the interference with the wound
as rather likely to increase the danger of infection than to decrease it.

Dressings should not be too frequent; two should suffice for simple wounds with type forms
of entry and exit; there is little discharge and usually no bleeding: hence the more the dry
scab form of healing can be simulated the better. When a dressing needs changing from fouling
of its outer parts, it is preferable to cut round the adherent part of the deep layers and
apply some fresh gauze over the central scab rather than to remove it. One point should be
kept in mind: the first dressing in the Field hospital seals the fate of the wound as to the
chances of primary union, and hence too much care is impossible with it.

Operations in the Field hospitals were proportionately not numerous, and they should be kept
down in number, as far as possible. At the same time such operations as are necessary are mostly
of capital importance, such as the treatment of fractures of the skull, abdominal section,
the ligature of arteries, and amputations. Of these only the first and last classes occur with
any degree of frequency. In order to be prepared for these a stock of filtered water which
has been boiled, and some special sterilised sponges, should be at hand if possible, also some
small towels which can be wrung out in antiseptic lotion. If sterilised sponges are not to
be had, wool pads wrung out in carbolic lotion must be substituted.

Primary amputations bore transport badly. I saw few sent down from the front within a few days
of their performance in which the flaps did not slough, or worse consequences ensue. On the
other hand, if the first fortnight could be tided over at the front, they did well enough.
The head cases on the other hand bore movement fairly well, provided only that asepsis was ensured.

Retained bullets are rarely suitable for removal in the rush of the first work of a Field hospital
after an engagement. A short delay is of no importance, and ensures their being removed safely
if necessary. With regard to the broad question of the advisability of removing them at all,
it may be laid down that they should not be interfered with unless some obvious reason exists.
Those most commonly calling for removal are as follows: 1. Bullets lying immediately beneath
the skin or quite superficially in any region, or those which, although they have produced
an exit opening, yet lie within the body. 2. Those which lie at the bottom of an infected track,
or cause secondary suppuration. 3. Those causing pressure on important structures, particularly
nerves. 4. Those which interfere with the movements of joints when lodged in the bones or soft
tissues in close proximity, or those which lie within the articular cavity itself. Bullets
sunk in the great body cavities or in positions difficult of access should never be interfered
with. Retained bullets sometimes give rise to unexpected surprises; thus in a man with a retained
bullet in the pelvis no steps for its removal were taken. During the man's voyage home on a
transport he had an attack of retention of urine. As a catheter would not pass, he was placed
in a warm bath, and shortly after passed a Mauser bullet per urethram, and thus saved himself
a cystotomy.

One word may be added as to the treatment of shock when severe. Quiet in the supine position,
and the administration of a small amount of stimulant, was usually all that was required. Hypodermic
injections of strychnine sulph. grs. 1/30 to 1/10 were useful, and in some severe cases, especially
where operations were needed, saline infusions with a small amount of stimulant were made into
the veins, either at the elbow, or in amputation cases into one of the large veins exposed.

The treatment of hæmorrhage is dealt with in Chapter IV.

The after treatment of simple wounds needs little comment, but bearing in mind what has been
said as to the definite healing of the internal portion of the tracks, it will be obvious that
in parts such as the thigh or calf, care was needed as to not commencing active work at too
early a date. On the other hand, a too long period of absolute rest is also to be deprecated.
The best results were obtained by careful movement and massage, commenced after the first week
or ten days, according to the appearance presented by the external wound, followed by a gradual
resumption of active movement. It was a striking fact that some of the patients suffering from
such wounds took longer to become apparently well than many of those who had suffered visceral
injuries.

CHAPTER IV

INJURIES TO THE BLOOD VESSELS

The small calibre of the modern bullet, and its tendency to take a direct course, naturally
favour the occurrence of more or less uncomplicated wounds of the large vascular trunks, and
both the nature of these wounds and the results which follow them are in some respects most
characteristic.

NATURE OF THE LESIONS

1. Contusion or laceration without perforation.--(a)The vessel may be struck laterally, the
injured portion then forming a part of the bounding wall of the wound track, or (b) one or
more layers of the vessel wall may be destroyed over a limited area. Given primary union, these
conditions are only of importance in so far as subsequent contraction of the lumen of the vessel
may result from implication in the neighbouring cicatrix. One of the most striking features
of the wounds as a whole was seen in the hair-breadth escapes of the large limb vessels with
no subsequent ill effects, and such injuries were seen in every situation.

In a certain proportion of wounds in close proximity to large vessels, however, a diminution
of the normal calibre of the arteries was observed, either shortly after the injury or later
in the advanced stages of cicatrisation. As an example of early obstruction, the following
may be related. A Mauser bullet passed from the inner side of the thigh across the neck and
great trochanter of the femur beneath the femoral vessels, and probably struck and grooved
the bone, since the aperture of exit was large and irregular, some 3/4 of an inch in diameter.
One week later no pulse was palpable in either anterior or posterior tibial arteries at the
ankle, and pulsation which was strong in the common femoral artery was very weak in the superficial
femoral. Slight fulness existed in the hollow of Scarpa's triangle, but not sufficient to make
any serious difference in the contour of the two limbs. No thrill or abnormal murmur was discoverable.
There was no oedema of the limb, which was also normal in temperature. The patient was kept
at rest in the supine position for three weeks, during which time the tibial pulses gradually
returned. Three weeks later he was invalided home, the pulses, however, still remaining considerably
smaller than normal.

In the advanced stages of cicatrisation narrowing of the lumen of the trunk vessels was far
from uncommon, especially in cases of wounds of the arm crossing the course of the brachial
artery; in many of these the radial pulse was diminished almost to imperceptibility. How far
this condition may prove permanent there has been little opportunity of judging; nor as to
the possible ultimate weakening of the vessel wall and the development of a secondary aneurism
has time allowed the acquisition of experience. In the light of the observation of so many
cases in which large vessels were wounded without the occurrence of severe hæmorrhage, either
primary or secondary, it is impossible to be certain whether some of the cases of arterial
obstruction were not secondary to perforating lesions of the vessels.

Pressure on, or minor lesion of the vessel was sometimes evidenced by the development of a
murmur, as in the following case. A Mauser bullet entered immediately within and below the
left coracoid process, and emerged at the back of the arm at its inner margin, 2-1/2 inches
above the junction of the right posterior axillary fold. During the first week dysphagia and
some pain and soreness in the episternal notch, with pain and difficulty of respiration, were
noticed. Eight weeks later no trouble with the pharynx or oesophagus remained, but a short
sharp systolic murmur was audible over the first part of the left axillary artery, which could
be extinguished by pressure on the subclavian; the radial pulse was normal.[14]

When primary union failed or was prevented by infection and suppuration, lesions, although
incomplete, of the vessel coat naturally frequently gave rise to secondary hæmorrhage.

2. Perforation of the vessels.--(a) This may be oblique or transverse to the long axis of a
trunk; when the vessel is impinged upon laterally, an oval or circular notch, as the case may
be, is produced; or (b) the bullet may strike more or less in the centre of the vessel, perforating
both in front and behind, while lateral continuity is maintained; (c) beyond these degrees
a vessel may, of course, be completely divided. Cases of notching of the vessel will be referred
to under the heading of traumatic aneurism; those of perforation under that of aneurismal varix
and varicose aneurism, the perforations in these cases affecting a parallel artery and vein.

RESULTS OF INJURY TO THE VESSELS

1. Hæmorrhage.--The fact that hæmorrhage was not a prominent feature in the wounds received
during this campaign can scarcely be regarded as an experience confined to injuries caused
by bullets of small calibre. The same observation was often made in the case of larger bullets
in old days, and the absence of severe hæmorrhage has previously been regarded as a special
characteristic of gunshot wounds. None the less, as high a proportion as 50 per cent. of deaths
occurring on the field in earlier days has been ascribed to this cause.

Unfortunately no new facts can be furnished on this point, although a few cases of rapid death
from primary hæmorrhage will be found recounted under the heading of visceral injuries. Beyond
these the general evidence offered by observations on men brought in from the field with vascular
injuries, was opposed to the frequent occurrence of death from hæmorrhage, at any rate of an
external nature. This subject will be dealt with under the classical three headings of primary,
recurrent, and secondary hæmorrhage.

Primary hæmorrhage.--A marked distinction needs to be drawn between external and internal hæmorrhage.
External hæmorrhage from the great vessels of the limbs, or even of the neck, proved responsible
for a remarkably small proportion of the deaths on the battlefield. This statement may be made
with confidence, since it is not only my own experience, but coincides with what I was able
to glean from many medical officers with the Field bearer companies. It is, moreover, supported
by the facts that cases in which primary ligature had been resorted to were extremely rare
at the Base hospitals, while, on the other hand, traumatic aneurisms and aneurismal varices
of any one of the great trunks of the neck and limbs were comparatively common. Again, primary
amputation for small-calibre bullet wounds, except when complicated by severe injury to the
bones, was so rare as to render more than doubtful the frequent occurrence of severe primary
hæmorrhage on the field. Only one case of rapid death due to bleeding from a limb artery was
recounted to me. In this a wound of the first part of the axillary artery proved fatal in the
twenty minutes occupied by the removal of the patient to the dressing station. The amount of
hæmorrhage in many instances was no doubt checked by the application of pressure at the time
of the first field dressing; but it can scarcely be argued that such dressings as were applied
were of sufficient firmness to control bleeding from such trunks as the brachial, femoral,
or carotid arteries.

The spontaneous cessation of hæmorrhage is rather to be ascribed to the special method of production
and the consequent nature of the wound. The lesions were the result of immense force strictly
localised in its application, which might well induce very complete and rapid contraction of
the vessel wall; while the track in the soft parts was not only narrow, but also lined by a
thin layer of tissue possibly so devitalised superficially as to specially favour rapid coagulation
of the blood. Beyond this the tracks were often sinuous when the position of the limb at the
time of reception of the injury was replaced by one of rest. The influence of mere narrowness
of the track is illustrated by classical experience in the development of aneurismal varices
after stabs by knives or bayonets; and in the injuries under consideration the frequent development
of large interstitial hæmorrhages into the tissues of the limbs indicated that blood does not
readily travel along the wound track. It was noteworthy that when hæmorrhage did occur it was
most free from, or often limited to, the wound of exit. This is due to the direction of the
active current set up by the rush of the bullet through the tissues. The mechanical factor
is, no doubt, the most important.

Control of primary hæmorrhage from a wounded vessel by the impaction of a foreign body was
of much less frequent occurrence than appears to have been the case with the older bullets.
I saw a case in which, on removal of a fragment of shell (Mr. S. W. F. Richardson), very free
hæmorrhage occurred from a wound of one of the circumflex arteries of the thigh, but not a
single one in which a similar result followed the extraction of a bullet of small calibre.
The comparative infrequency of retention of modern bullets is probably one of the main elements
in this relation. A very curious instance of provisional plugging of a wound in the upper part
of the brachial artery by an inserted loop of the musculo-spiral nerve was related to me by
Mr. Clinton Dent. This instance must, I think, be regarded as an accident definitely dependent
on the size and outline of the bullet and on the nature of the force transmitted by it to neighbouring
structures.

While, however, deaths from external primary hæmorrhage were rare, a considerable number resulted
from primary internal hæmorrhage. In some of these, injury to the largest trunks in the thorax
or abdomen led to an immediately fatal issue; in others wounds of the large visceral arteries,
as of the lungs, liver, or mesentery, were scarcely less rapid in their results. In such cases
the potential space offered by the peritoneal or pleural cavities favours the ready escape
of blood from the wounded vessel, while the tendency of the blood effused into serous cavities
to rapid coagulation is notably slight. Beyond this the comparative deficiency in direct support
afforded by surrounding structures to vessels running in the large body cavities is also an
important element in their behaviour when wounded.

These remarks receive support from the observation that few, if any, patients survived an injury
to the external iliac vessels within the abdomen, while the remarkable instances of escape
from fatal hæmorrhage from large vessels recorded below (cases 1-19) indicate that the mere
size of a wounded vessel is not to be regarded as the sole factor in prognosis.

Recurrent hæmorrhage was occasionally met with both in the case of the limb and trunk vessels.
In the limbs it often necessitated ligature of the artery. I saw several cases in the lower
extremity where recurrent hæmorrhage on the second or third day was treated by ligature of
the femoral or popliteal artery, and it also occurred during the course of development of one
of the carotid aneurisms recounted below. On two occasions I saw rapid death follow recurrent
abdominal hæmorrhage; in one I was standing in a tent when a man who had been wounded the day
before suddenly exclaimed: 'Why, I am going to die after all.' The appearance of the man was
ghastly, and on examining the abdomen it was found greatly distended, and with dulness in the
flanks; the patient expired a few minutes later. Another example of recurrent abdominal hæmorrhage
is related in case 169, p. 432.

Secondary hæmorrhage.--In simple wounds of the soft parts by small-calibre bullets this was
decidedly rare. In wounds complicated by fractures of the bones, especially when they exhibited
the so-called 'explosive' character, secondary hæmorrhage was not uncommon, and this not necessarily
in conjunction with infection and suppuration.

In the chapter on fracture some remarks will be found on the prolongation of healing often
observed in the exit portion of the wound track, which is explained by the well-known fact
that, given an aseptic condition of the wound, sloughs of tissue separate very slowly. Secondary
hæmorrhage in these cases is due to lesions of the vessel short of perforation, but severe
enough to so lower the vitality that local gangrene of the wall occurs. In such instances hæmorrhage
most usually occurred on the tenth to the fourteenth day, but occasionally still later. In
one instance of ligature of the anterior tibial artery for such hæmorrhage three-quarters of
the whole lumen of the vessel had been devitalised. The resemblance of some cases of secondary
hæmorrhage of this class to those occasionally observed after amputation, and due to accidental
non-perforative injury of the artery at the time of operation above the point of ligature,
was very striking.

In other cases secondary hæmorrhage was the result of perforation of the vessel by a sharp
spicule of bone, but in the large majority sepsis and suppuration were the cause. Naturally
therefore the accident was commoner in the more severe kinds of wound, and in those caused
by large bullets or fragments of shell. The symptoms in nearly all cases were the classical
ones of repeated small hæmorrhages followed by a sudden copious gush.

The forms of secondary hæmorrhage, however, which afforded most interest were the interstitial
and the internal, mainly on account of the scope they allowed for diagnosis.

Characteristic examples of internal secondary hæmorrhage are furnished by cases of chest injury
accompanied by hæmothorax and fully dealt with under that heading (Chapter X.). Cases of interstitial
secondary hæmorrhage are also described under the heading of traumatic aneurism and abdominal
injuries (No. 194, p. 445). It therefore suffices here merely to remark on the diagnostic difficulties
the condition gave rise to. These mainly depended upon the elevation of general bodily temperature
by which the hæmorrhage was often accompanied. Further evidence of the condition was furnished
by the development of local swellings, or physical signs indicative of the collection of fluid
in a serous cavity. These signs developed rapidly, and the rise of temperature was sudden and
decided enough to suggest commencing suppuration. In several cases incisions were made under
the supposition that this had already occurred.

The fever accompanying blood effusions was generally a somewhat special feature in the wounds
of the campaign. At first bearing in mind that in every case a track, even if closed, led from
the surface to the effused blood, one was disposed to suspect an infection of the clot of a
somewhat innocuous nature. The absence of subsequent suppuration, however, was definitely opposed
to this view, and suggested that the fever resulted from absorption of some element of the
blood, possibly the fibrin ferment, or some form of albumose. A pronounced illustration was
in fact afforded of the evanescent rise of temperature usually the accompaniment of simple
fractures in the case of the limbs, and of the more marked rise not uncommon in cases of traumatic
blood effusion into the peritoneal cavity, or when the pleuræ or joints were the seats of the
mischief. In the case of interstitial hæmorrhages I only remember to have seen fever of such
marked continued type in the subjects of hæmophilia with recent effusions, although one is
of course acquainted with it in a less pronounced form as a result of hæmorrhage into operation
wounds.

In primary interstitial hæmorrhages a similar continued rise of temperature was also common,
and I cannot perhaps better illustrate its character than by the brief relation of two instances.

In a patient wounded at Kamelfontein the bullet entered four inches below the acromion, pierced
the deltoid, splintered the humerus, and crossed the axilla. A large blood extravasation developed
in the axilla, accompanied by cutaneous ecchymosis extending halfway down the arm. There was
no perceptible pulsation in either the brachial or radial artery, but the limb was warm. There
was partial paralysis of the parts supplied by the ulnar and musculo-spiral nerves and complete
loss of power and sensation in the area of distribution of the median nerve. Six months later
the radial pulse was still absent in this patient, but there was no sign of the development
of an aneurism.

The accompanying temperature chart is characteristic. The blood effusion gradually gained in
consistency and underwent steady diminution in size. No suppuration occurred.

The median paralysis was found to be accompanied by the inclusion of the nerve in a sort of
foramen of callus, when the patient was explored at a later date by Mr. Ballance.

In a patient wounded at Paardeberg, a Mauser bullet entered by the left buttock, pierced the
venter ilii, traversed the pelvis, and emerging at the brim of the latter, crossed the back,
fractured the spine of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and escaped below the twelfth right rib.
The track suppurated where it crossed the back, but the man did well until the twentieth day,
when a swelling developed in the left iliac fossa and the general temperature rose to 102°.
An abscess was at once suspected and the swelling incised by Major Lougheed, R.A.M.C. A large
subperitoneal hæmatoma only was discovered, and evacuated. The temperature at once fell and
the after progress was uneventful, the wound healing by primary union.

TREATMENT OF HÆMORRHAGE

Primary.--No deviation from the ordinary rules of surgery should be necessary in the majority
of cases, but in a certain number the conditions are so unusual that the special considerations
must be taken into account. The natural tendency to spontaneous cessation of primary hæmorrhage
in small-calibre wounds is the first of these. Experience has shown that often mere dressing,
or at any rate slight pressure, suffices to efficiently stanch immediate bleeding. Although,
however, immediate control is to be obtained by such means, the cases of traumatic aneurism
of every variety related in the next section show that the ultimate result is in many such
cases by no means satisfactory.

Under these circumstances it may be said that the classical rule of ligation at the point of
injury should never be disregarded. Against this, however, certain objections may be at once
raised; thus in many cases both artery and vein need ligature, a consideration of much importance
in the case of such vessels as the carotid and femoral arteries. Again in many of the injuries
to the popliteal artery the wound directly communicated with the knee joint, a complication
which, while it may be disregarded in civil practice, must take a much more important place
in the circumstances under which many operations in military surgery are performed.

On the whole, it seems clear that the military surgeon must be guided by circumstances, since
it may be far better to risk the chances of recurrent hæmorrhage, or the development of an
aneurism or varix, all of which are amenable to successful treatment later, than those of gangrene
of a limb or softening of the brain. As a general rule, therefore, on the field or in a Field
hospital, primary ligature of the great vessels is best reserved for those cases only in which
hæmorrhage persists, while in those in which spontaneous cessation has occurred, or in which
bleeding is readily controlled by pressure, rest and an expectant attitude are to be preferred.

A word must be added as to the objections to distant proximal ligature for primary or recurrent
hæmorrhage. In some situations this may be unavoidable, and it is sometimes successful, but
none the less it is opposed to all rules of good surgery and a most uncertain procedure. It
leaves the patient exposed to all the risks attendant on the employment of simple pressure.
In one case which I saw, the third part of the subclavian artery had been ligatured for axillary
bleeding; secondary hæmorrhage, as might have been expected, occurred, and that as late as
five weeks after the operation. In another case ligature of the femoral artery for popliteal
hæmorrhage was followed by the development of a traumatic aneurism in the ham.

Secondary.--In secondary hæmorrhage the treatment to be adopted depends upon the nature of
the case. When the wound is aseptic, and bleeding the result of the separation of sloughs,
local ligature is the proper treatment, and this was often successfully adopted, especially
in the case of such arteries as the tibials. In septic cases, on the other hand, it is usually
far better if possible to amputate, unless the general state of the patient and the local conditions
are especially favourable.

When neither amputation nor direct local ligature is practicable, proximal ligature may be
of use. Sometimes this may be obligatory in consequence of the difficulties attendant on direct
local treatment. I saw a few cases successfully treated in this manner: in one the common carotid
was tied (Mr. Jameson) for hæmorrhage from an arterial hæmatoma in connection with the internal
maxillary artery. Although ligature of the external carotid would perhaps have been preferable,
the result was excellent. When even this expedient is impracticable, local pressure is the
only resort.

Lastly, as to the treatment of secondary interstitial blood effusions, I believe the best initial
treatment is the expectant. If interference is needed, it is much more likely to be satisfactory
the more chronic the condition has become, since the source of the bleeding may be impossible
to discover. I never saw a patient's life endangered by the amount of such hæmorrhage, but
if this should seem to be likely, local treatment is of course unavoidable. In several cases
quoted below, incision and evacuation were followed by excellent results; in any such operation
too much care to ensure asepsis is impossible.

TRAUMATIC ANEURISMS

The experience of the campaign fully bears out that of the past as to the steady increase of
the number of aneurisms from gunshot wounds in direct ratio to diminution in the size of the
projectiles employed. Every variety of traumatic aneurism was met with, and most frequently
of all, perhaps, aneurismal varices and varicose aneurisms. While so experienced a military
surgeon as Pirogoff could say, in 1864, that he had never seen a case of aneurismal varix,
every young surgeon lately in South Africa has met with a series. Again, although the condition
is a well-known one, it has been rather in connection with civil life; for the great majority
of recorded cases were the result of stabs or punctured wounds such as are liable to be received
in street brawls, or as a result of accidents with the tools of mechanics. Thus of ninety cases
collected by K. Bardeleben in 1871, only 12 or 13.33 per cent. were the result of gunshot wound.

False traumatic aneurism or arterial hæmatoma.--This condition was met with comparatively frequently,
and bears a very close relation to that already described under the heading of interstitial
hæmorrhages. The latter might almost have been included here, since the difference between
the two conditions depended merely on the size of the vessels implicated. The exact correspondence
in the period of development of some of the arterial hæmatomata, and of the occurrence of the
aseptic form of secondary hæmorrhage, also explains the pathology of the two conditions as
identical; except that in the former the effused blood is retained in the tissues, while in
the latter it escapes externally. The history of these cases was uniform and characteristic.
A wound of the soft parts, or sometimes a fracture, was accompanied by a certain degree of
primary interstitial hæmorrhage, which might or might not have been associated with external
bleeding. A hæmatoma resulted in connection with the wounded vessel, the general tendency in
the effusion being to coagulation at the margins and subsequent contraction. Meanwhile the
opening in the artery became more or less securely closed by the development of thrombus, and
possibly by retraction of the inner and middle coats of the vessel. With the return of full
circulatory force as shock passed off, or with the resumption of activity and consequent freer
movement of the limb, the temporary thrombus became washed away. The newly formed wall of soft
clot bounding the effusion proved insufficient to withstand the full force of the blood pressure,
and extension of the cavity resulted. In the more rapidly developing hæmatomata, temporary
pressure by the effused blood on the bleeding vessels was also, no doubt, a common explanation
of temporary cessation of increase in size.

A diffuse soft fluctuating swelling, sometimes accompanied by pulsation, but oftener without,
developed, and not uncommonly diffusion was accompanied by some discoloration of the surface
and elevation of the general temperature. Such arterial hæmatomata commonly developed from
ten days to three weeks after the original wound. A few examples will suffice.

     (1) A patient wounded at Elandslaagte was sent down to Wynberg.
     The antero-posterior wound in the upper third of the arm was
     healed, but a month after the injury a large fluctuating
     arterial hæmatoma developed in the axilla and upper third of
     the arm. This was incised (Colonel Stevenson) and a wound of
     the axillary artery in its third part discovered, and the
     vessel ligatured. The patient made an excellent recovery.

     (2) A patient received a wound at Doornkop which traversed the
     calf in an obliquely antero-posterior longitudinal direction.
     Three weeks later a soft fluctuating swelling developed at the
     inner margin of the tendo Achillis occupying the lower third of
     the leg. Neither pulsation nor murmur was detected. There was
     anæsthesia in the area of distribution of the posterior tibial
     nerve. No tendency to further increase was observed, and
     operation was postponed. The temperature was normal.

     (3) An Imperial Yeoman was struck at Zwartskopfontein at a
     range of one hundred yards. The man rode four miles on his
     horse after being hit, but the horse then fell and rolled over
     him twice. The man was treated successively in the Van Alen,
     Boshof, and Kimberley Hospitals, and from the last he was sent
     to Wynberg which place he reached on the twenty-third day. When
     admitted into No. 2 General Hospital the wounds of type form
     and size (entry, in posterior fold of axilla; exit, 1-1/2
     inch below junction of anterior fold with arm) were healed. The
     whole upper arm was swollen and discoloured, while an indurated
     mass extended along the line of the vessels into the axilla.
     This was considered a blood effusion; it was not obviously
     distensile, and pulsation was very slight. The brachial radial
     and ulnar pulses were absent. A fluctuating swelling was
     present along the anterior border of the deltoid. There were
     some signs of nerve contusion, but no paralysis, beyond tactile
     anæsthesia in the area of distribution of the median nerve.

     Four days later little alteration had been noticed beyond a
     tendency to variation in firmness of the different parts of the
     swelling. On the thirty-first day considerable enlargement was
     observed. This enlargement, together with continued rise of
     temperature, aroused the suspicion of suppuration, and an
     exploratory puncture with a von Graefe's knife was made by
     Major Lougheed, R.A.M.C., after consultation with Professor
     Chiene. Blood clot first escaped, followed by free arterial
     hæmorrhage. The incision was enlarged while compression of the
     third part of the subclavian was maintained; a large quantity
     of clot was turned out, and an obliquely oval wound half an
     inch in long diameter was found in the axillary artery.
     Ligatures were applied above and below the opening between the
     converging heads of the median nerve. The veins were not
     damaged. The wound healed by first intention. On the twelfth
     day a feeble radial pulse was perceptible, and shortly
     afterwards the man left for England, diminished median tactile
     sensation being the only remnant of the original symptoms.

     (4) A private of the 2nd Rifle Brigade was struck while
     doubling at Geluk, at a range of one hundred yards. The Mauser
     bullet entered four inches above the upper border of the left
     patella, internal to the mid line of the limb, and escaped in
     the centre of the popliteal space. The man lay in a farmhouse
     during the night and bled considerably from both wounds. He did
     not fall when struck, but could not walk. He was sent to No. 2
     General Hospital in Pretoria. On arrival there the external
     wounds were scabbed over, and a large tumour existed beneath
     the entrance wound. There was much discoloration from
     ecchymosis, but no pulsation could be detected. The posterior
     tibial pulse was good. At the end of ten days pulsation became
     marked both in the front of the limb and in the popliteal
     space. There were no symptoms of nerve injury. On the
     thirteenth day an Esmarch's bandage was applied and Major
     Lougheed laid the tumour open opposite the opening in the
     adductor magnus. Much clot was removed, and both artery and
     vein, which were found divided in the adductor canal, were
     ligatured.

     The foot remained very cold for the first twenty-four hours,
     but otherwise progress was satisfactory, the wound healing by
     first intention. No pulsation was palpable in the tibials at
     the end of a month.

For the last two cases I am very much indebted to Major Lougheed. I am glad to include them,
as they illustrate one or two points of special importance. No. 3 shows the tendency to variation
in the tension and firmness of the tumours, the tendency to primary contraction of the sac,
followed by diffusion, and the rise of temperature often accompanying the latter occurrence.
This is of great interest in relation to the similar rise of temperature seen with the increase
of hæmorrhage in cases of hæmothorax. For purposes of comparison, the progress may well be
considered alongside of that in the case related on p. 119, in which the wounded vessel was
probably also the main trunk itself.

No. 4 differs from any of the others in depending on a complete division of a large artery
and vein. The development of the hæmatoma was consequently more rapid and continuous. Another
point of interest was the maintenance of pulsation in the tibial vessels, in spite of complete
solution of continuity in the parent trunk. That this was independent of the collateral circulation
seems evident from its complete disappearance and slowness of return after ligation of the
wounded vessels.

Prognosis and treatment.--The treatment in these cases is sufficiently obvious, and consists
in direct incision and ligature of the wounded vessels. The cases related show the success
with which this procedure was attended, since uniformly good results were obtained. When possible,
an Esmarch's tourniquet should be applied in the case of the lower limb. In the upper, compression
of the subclavian is necessary during interference with axillary hæmatomata, combined with
direct pressure on the bleeding spot after the clot has been removed. In the case of the arm,
digital compression is always to be preferred, in view of the well-known danger of damage to
the brachial nerves from the tourniquet.

Proximal ligature is always to be avoided. It is inadequate, and proved more dangerous as far
as the vitality of the limb was concerned, the latter point probably depending on the interference
with the collateral circulation by pressure from the extravasated blood, which is unrelieved
by the operation. I know of at least two cases of gangrene which occurred consecutively to
proximal ligature of the femoral artery for this condition.

True traumatic aneurisms.--The cases met with differed so little from those seen in ordinary
civil practice, that but slight notice of them is necessary. They differed from the last variety
mainly in the more localised nature of the tumour, the greater firmness of its walls, and the
more pronounced expansile pulsation. The development of this form of aneurism was probably
influenced by several circumstances, such as the more complete rest secured for the patient,
the locality in the limb as affecting movement of the spot in the vessel actually wounded,
the size of the opening in the vessel, and the degree of support afforded by surrounding structures.
(Examples are furnished by cases 6-9.)

Under the influence of rest, all that I saw tended to contract and become firmer, and they
so far resembled spontaneous aneurisms as to be readily cured by proximal ligature of the artery.
The ideal treatment no doubt consists in local incision and ligature on either side of the
wounded spot, with or without ablation of the sac. The choice of direct or proximal ligature
in any case depends on the position of the aneurism, and the ease with which the former operation
can be carried out. In all these cases a very great advantage in the localisation and diminution
of the tumours was gained by postponing interference until they became stationary. I need scarcely
add that any evidence of diffusion indicated immediate operation. The preference of direct
or proximal ligation will probably, to a certain extent, always depend on the personal predilection
of the surgeon, but while proximal ligature has often given good immediate results during this
campaign, it cannot be with certainty decided whether the patients are definitely protected
from the dangers of recurrence.

Reference to cases 7 and 9 as illustrating the possible spontaneous cure of traumatic aneurisms
is of great interest.

I saw a number of cases successfully treated by proximal ligature; also a number where continuous
improvement followed rest, and which were sent home for further treatment. None of these demand
any special mention.

One case of a very special nature, which terminated fatally, is of great interest:--

     (5) In a man wounded at Belmont the bullet entered the second
     left intercostal space and was retained in the thorax. He was
     sent directly to the Base and came under the care of Mr.
     Thornton at No. 1 General Hospital, Wynberg. Signs of wound of
     the lung developed in the form of hæmoptysis and left
     hæmothorax. The left radial pulse was almost imperceptible.

     The entry wound did not close by primary union, and three weeks
     later an incision was made into the chest in consequence of the
     presence of fever, progressive emaciation, and weakness.
     Breaking down blood clot was evacuated: general improvement
     followed, and the radial pulse increased considerably in
     volume.

     A fortnight later sudden severe hæmorrhage occurred from the
     external wound, and the man rapidly collapsed and died. At the
     post-mortem a traumatic aneurism the size of an orange was
     found in connection with an oval wound in the first portion of
     the left subclavian artery which admitted the tip of the
     forefinger.

This case is noteworthy as an illustration of the magnitude of an artery which can be wounded
without leading to rapid death from primary hæmorrhage, even when in communication with a serous
sac, and still more as emphasising the importance of weakening of the radial pulse as a sign
in connection with a wound of the upper part of the chest on the left side. It is somewhat
surprising that this sign was not marked in two cases (Nos. 13 and 14, p. 140) recorded below,
in which the innominate and right carotid arteries respectively were probably perforated.

     (6) Traumatic popliteal aneurism.--Wounded at Modder River.
     Entry (Mauser), over centre of tibia 1 inch above the
     tubercle. Exit, about centre of popliteal space. No
     hæmorrhage of any importance occurred from the wound, but there
     was a typical hæmarthrosis, which subsided slowly. Twelve days
     after the injury a pulsating swelling the size of a hen's egg,
     to which attention was drawn on account of pain, was noted in
     popliteal space. The pulsation extended upwards in the line of
     the artery some 3 inches. The limb was placed on a splint and
     treated by rest, and a month later the aneurism had decreased
     to one half its former size, the wall having greatly increased
     in firmness. Pulsation was easily controlled by pressure above
     the tumour; there was no thrill present, but a high-pitched
     bellows murmur. The patient was sent home on February 1.

When admitted at Netley the patient came under the care of Major Dick, R.A.M.C., who ligatured
the popliteal artery on the proximal side by an incision in the line of the tendon of the adductor
magnus. The aneurism then consolidated.

     (7) Traumatic popliteal aneurism.--Wounded at Magersfontein.
     Entry (Mauser), centre of patella. Exit, centre of
     popliteal space; the knee was bent at the time it was struck.
     There was considerable primary external hæmorrhage, and so much
     blood collected in the knee-joint that it was aspirated. On the
     eighth day secondary hæmorrhage occurred from the exit wound
     and the femoral artery was tied in Hunter's canal. No further
     hæmorrhage occurred, but at the end of three weeks feeble
     pulsation was palpable in the popliteal space, suggesting an
     aneurism; the latter decreased and the patient was sent home
     apparently well.

     (8) Traumatic axillary aneurism.--Wounded at Karree. The
     bullet entered 2-1/2 inches below the acromial end of the right
     clavicle and emerged over the 9th rib in the posterior axillary
     line. The Mauser bullet was found in the patient's haversack.
     Both apertures were of the slit form, and healed per primam.
     Three weeks later at Wynberg a large arterial hæmatoma which
     pulsated was noted in the axilla. Signs of injury to the
     musculo-spiral nerve were also observed. The tumour altered
     little, but a fortnight later Major Burton, R.A.M.C., cut down
     upon it through the pectorals. The aneurism was of the third
     part of the axillary artery, and a ligature was applied at the
     lower margin of the pectoralis minor. The wound healed by
     primary union and the aneurism rapidly shrank. The patient left
     for England a month later; the musculo-spiral paralysis was
     improving. I am indebted to Major Burton for the notes of this
     case.

     (9) Traumatic popliteal aneurism.--Wounded in Natal. Entry
     (Mauser), immediately above head of fibula. Exit, immediately
     inside semi-tendinosus tendon at level of central popliteal
     crease. Fulness but no pulsation was noted at end of three
     weeks; seven days later pulsation was evident, and an aneurism
     the size of a pigeon's egg, with firm walls, became localised
     and palpable. It gave rise to no symptoms, and patient refused
     operation during the three weeks he remained in hospital. The
     aneurism continued to contract, and the patient was sent home.
     The aneurism has since spontaneously consolidated.

Aneurismal varix and varicose (arterio-venous) aneurism.--Uncomplicated cases of aneurismal
varix, as might be expected, were less common than those in which the arterio-venous communication
was accompanied by the formation of a traumatic sac. The initial lesion accountable for each
condition was, however, probably identical, and dependent on the passage of a bullet of small
calibre across the line of large parallel arteries and veins. Thus, obliquely coursing antero-posterior
wounds of the neck produced carotid and jugular varices; vertically coursing tracks laid the
subclavian vessels in communication; antero-posterior tracks the brachial, popliteal, and lower
part of the femoral; and transverse tracks, the vessels of the calf and forearm. Given an arterial
wound, the mode of development of the aneurismal sac in no way differs from that of the ordinary
traumatic variety; the main point of interest, therefore, is to seek an explanation of the
causes which may restrict the ultimate result to the formation of a pure aneurismal varix.
The explanation is possibly to be found in some of the following circumstances.

Size, position, and symmetry of the vascular wound.--It seems scarcely necessary to insist
on the calibre of the projectile, since this alone determined the frequency of these conditions,
but it must be borne in mind that in the diameter of the bullets, classed as of small calibre
during this war, a range of from 6.5-8 mm. existed. In the case of both the Krag-Jörgensen
and Mauser, the shape of the bullet also was better adapted to pure perforation of the vessels.
I saw no case of arterio-venous communication in which a larger bullet than one of the four
types chosen had been responsible for the primary injury, but a difference of 1-1/2 mm. in
calibre in the small projectile might well determine the division, the pure and symmetrical
perforation of the two vessels, or the giving way of one side, so that they were deeply notched
instead of perforated.

Such positive evidence as was afforded by operation as to the exact condition of the vessels
in two cases of femoral arterio-venous aneurism was, that in either case a clean perforation
existed.

It is improbable that notching of the two vessels can primarily produce a pure varix, although
it may result in the formation of an arterio-venous aneurism, especially if the bullet should
have passed between the two vessels in such a way as to notch the contiguous sides. It is impossible
to say, in any given case, what the result of secondary contraction of a sac produced in this
manner may be in the determination of the ultimate relation of the vessels. In many of the
cases clinically designated pure varix, the remains of such a sac may still actually persist.
In the case also of pure perforation of the vessels, it is difficult to believe that a localised
blood cavity has not originally existed. Given complete division of the vessels, as far as
my experience went, arterial hæmatoma was the uniform result.

Under these circumstances I am inclined to believe that a symmetrical perforation of both vessels
is the most common precursor of either condition; that the pure varix is the rarer and less
likely result, and that its formation is dependent mainly on certain anatomical conditions.
The most important of these conditions are the proximity and degree of cohesion of the two
vessels, the comparative spaciousness or the opposite of the vascular cleft, and the degree
of support afforded by surrounding structures.

Thus, the close proximity of the popliteal artery and vein, together with the particularly
firm adhesion which exists between the vessels, probably favours the formation of a varix;
again, a varix more readily forms if the femoral artery and vein are wounded in Hunter's canal
than if the injury is situated high in Scarpa's triangle, where the vessels lie in a large
areolar space. The passage of a bullet between an artery and vein may perhaps produce either
condition, but wide separation of the two vessels, as for instance of the subclavian artery
and vein, renders an aneurismal sac almost a certainty. These suggestions seem borne out by
the cases recounted below, since the pure varices are one femoral, one popliteal, and one axillary.
I cannot include the calf and forearm cases, as the existence of a small sac could not be disproved.

To these anatomical factors certain others must be added. In most cases a false sac exists
at first, which tends to undergo contraction and spontaneous cure, as is observed in some of
the ordinary traumatic sacs. This history of development is moreover supported by the observation
that proximal ligature of the artery usually converts an arterio-venous aneurism into an aneurismal
varix. The process is no doubt favoured by cleanness and small size of the perforation, moderation
in the amount of primary hæmorrhage, the tone and resistance of the surrounding tissues, special
points in the circulatory force and condition of the blood, and the possibility of maintaining
the part at rest after the injury.

Aneurismal varix, when pure, was evidenced by the presence of purring thrill and machinery
murmur alone. In none of the cases I saw was pain or swelling of the limb present. In one popliteal
varix, slight varicosity of the superficial veins of the leg was present, but it was not certain
that the development of this was not antecedent to the injury, as the patient did not notice
it until his attention was drawn to its existence. In none of the cases under observation in
South Africa had enough time elapsed for sufficient dilatation of the artery above the point
of communication to give rise to any confusion from this cause as to the presence of a sac.

When an arterio-venous sac has once formed, clinical observation shows that the general tendency
is towards extension in the direction of least resistance. This direction of course varies
with the situation of the aneurism, and also with the nature of the wound track.

Speaking generally the direction of least resistance in a typically pure perforation is towards
the vein. Initial flow of blood from the wounded artery is naturally favoured towards the potential
space afforded by a canal occupied by blood flowing at a lower degree of pressure. The partial
collapse of the vein dependent on the wound in its wall also probably helps in determining
the initial flow in its direction. Examples are afforded by the carotid aneurisms (cases 10,
11, and 14), and here it must be borne in mind that the outer limits of the cervical vascular
cleft are those least likely to offer resistance to extension of the sac. In each the aneurisms
mainly occupied the exit segment of the track; this is the general rule, as in the case of
external hæmorrhage, and is determined by the same cause.

The latter rule however finds exceptions when the entry segment is so situated as to cross
a region of lesser resistance, and case 12 illustrates this point with regard to the cervical
vascular cleft. Examples of the tendency to spread in the anatomical direction of least resistance
are also offered by the cases of aneurism at the root of the neck, where extension was into
the posterior triangle.

The further clinical history and signs are as follows. A local swelling is found, usually at
first diffuse, often commencing to develop with cessation of the external hæmorrhage. It increases,
for the first few days maintaining its diffuse character. If near the surface, it may be superficially
ecchymosed. At the end of this time a tendency to localisation, as evidenced by increasing
firmness and more definite margination, takes place, and this is followed by general contraction
and rounding off of the tumour. The latter process may be continuous, and eventually the sac
may become small and stationary or ultimately disappear and a pure varix be the result. The
latter is only likely to be the case under the most satisfactory of the conditions enumerated
above. Occasionally an opposite course may be followed, and fresh extension take place, as
evidenced by enlargement of the tumour, disappearance of sharp definition, softening, and pain.
The natural termination of such cases in the absence of interference would no doubt be rupture,
and possibly death in some positions, loss of the limb in others. The former I never saw.

Purring thrill.--This, the pathognomonic sign of either condition, was always present in the
fully developed stage, and is probably present from the first unless a temporary thrombosis
obstructs the vascular openings. It was noted as early as the third day in case 13. In many
of the other patients it was palpable only with the subsidence of the primary swelling attendant
on the injury. In some of the forearm and calf aneurisms, and in some of the popliteal, it
was only discovered by accident some weeks even after the injury, but this often because no
serious vascular lesion had been suspected. The thrill was widely conducted, often apparently
superficial on palpation, and much more pronounced with light than with forcible digital pressure.

In case 10 the visible vibration in consonance with the thrill when the vein was exposed during
the operation of ligature of the carotid was a novel experience to me.

Murmur.--The typical 'bee in the bag,' or 'machinery' murmur was present in every case, and
was often very widely distributed, especially over the thorax. (Cases 13, 14, and 20.)

In all three carotid cases the murmur was troublesome, being audible to the patient at night
when the head was rested on the side corresponding to the aneurism.

Expansile pulsation.--Pulsation in combination with the existence of a tumour is the main feature
in the diagnosis between the conditions of pure varix and varicose aneurism. It was not always
existent or prominent in the earliest stages, probably from temporary blocking of the artery,
or from the diffuse and irregular nature of the cavity offering conditions unsuitable to the
satisfactory transmission of the wave. When localisation had occurred it was always present.

EFFECTS OF ANEURISMAL VARIX OR VARICOSE ANEURISM ON THE CIRCULATION

(a) General.--The most striking feature in these injuries is the remarkable effect of the disturbance
to the even flow of the circulation on the heart. This first struck me in two of the cases
of carotid arterio-venous aneurism recorded below (Nos. 10 and 11). In these I was inclined
at first to attribute the rapid and irritable character of the pulse solely to injury to the
vagus, as in each laryngeal paralysis pointed to concussion or contusion of the nerve. The
pulse reached a rate of 120-140 to the minute. This disturbance was not of a transitory nature,
for in the two cases referred to the rapid pulse persists, in spite of entire recovery of the
laryngeal muscles, and the fact that in one case the aneurismal sac has been absolutely cured,
and in the second only a small sac remains, in each as a result of proximal ligature of the
carotid artery. In the former a varix still exists, and at the end of seven months the pulse
is still over 100. In the latter, in which a sac is still present, the pulse rate varies from
110 to 130. In each case the condition has now existed twelve months. My attention once directed
to this point, I noted a similar acceleration of the pulse in the case of these aneurisms elsewhere;
thus in a femoral aneurism the rate was 120, and in an axillary varix of twenty years' standing
which came under my observation the pulse rate varied from 110 to 120, according to the position
of the patient. Unfortunately I had not directed my attention to this point in the early series
of cases which came under observation.

It will be remarked in cases 13 and 14 that at the expiration of a year the pulse rate was
still high, but these again are cervical aneurisms each in contact with or near the vagus.

In a case of aneurismal varix of the femoral artery of three years' standing, which was under
the charge of Mr. Mackellar, the pulse rate was normal. In this instance great dilatation of
the vessels had occurred.

These observations raise the interesting question whether the irritable circulation which has
been classically considered one of the predisposing causes of spontaneous aneurism should not
rather be regarded as a result of the condition.

(b) Local.--In none of the cases of varix was the period of observation long enough to allow
me to determine the development of dilatation of the arterial trunk above the point of obstruction.
This, however, is the common sequence, and no doubt will occur in those patients who resume
active occupation without operation.

The effects of either condition on the distal circulation were remarkably slight. The distal
pulses were little, if at all, modified in strength or volume, and signs of venous obstruction,
if present at first, disappeared with much rapidity. In one case (No. 15) of a large arterio-venous
popliteal aneurism there was considerable swelling of the leg, but in this case the sac was
large and situated at the apex of the space, and no doubt exercised external pressure on the vein.

In the case of the carotid aneurisms, especially that probably on the internal carotid, transient
faintness was a symptom in the early stages of the case. All three of the cases recorded here,
however, had been the subjects of very free hæmorrhage, either primary or recurrent.

     (10) Carotid arterio-venous aneurism.--Wounded at Paardeberg.
     Entry (Mauser) to the right side of the Pomum Adami, exit
     at anterior margin of left trapezius, two inches below the
     angle of the jaw. There was some hæmorrhage at the time from
     the exit wound, but no hæmoptysis; about four hours later,
     however, in the Field hospital bleeding was so free that an
     incision was made with the object of tying the common carotid.
     During the preliminary stages of the operation bleeding ceased
     and the wound was closed without exposing the vessel. The
     patient remained a week in the Field hospital, and then made a
     three day and night's journey in a bullock waggon to Modder
     River (40 miles), and fourteen days later he was transferred to
     the Base hospital at Wynberg, when the condition was as
     follows. Operation and bullet wounds healed. Considerable
     extravasation of blood in the posterior triangle. Beneath the
     sterno-mastoid in the course of the bullet track, swelling,
     thrill and pulsation over an area 1-1/2 inch wide in diameter.
     Loud machinery murmur audible to the patient when the left side
     of the head is placed on the pillow, and widely distributed on
     auscultation. The left eye appears prominent, but the pupils
     are normal and equal in size. Voice weak and husky, and there
     is cough. Laryngoscopic examination showed the cords to be
     untouched, but some swelling still persisted. No headache, but
     giddiness is troublesome at times. Pulse 100, regular but
     somewhat irritable.

     The patient was kept quiet in the supine position for a month,
     and during this time the condition in many ways improved. The
     voice improved in strength, the pulse steadied, falling to 80,
     the prominence of the left eye disappeared, and all the blood
     effusion in the posterior triangle became absorbed. Meanwhile
     the aneurism contracted at first, until it became oval in
     outline, with a long axis of 2 inches by 1-1/2 broad extending
     in the line of the wound track, but mainly situated in the exit
     half. During the last fortnight, however, it remained quite
     stationary in size, and as it showed no further signs of
     diminution in spite of the favourable conditions under which
     the patient had been placed, it was considered best to try to
     ensure its consolidation by a proximal ligature. Thrill had
     become slightly less pronounced, and was less evident to the
     patient himself, but was otherwise unchanged. The probabilities
     in this case seemed rather in favour of wound of the internal
     carotid artery, and it was decided to bare the upper part of
     the common carotid, follow up the main trunk, and if possible
     apply the ligature to the internal branch. On April 12, 61 days
     after the injury, the classical incision for securing the
     common carotid was made, and the sterno-mastoid slightly
     retracted. It was found that the sac of the aneurism extended
     over the bifurcation of the artery, reaching to the wall of the
     larynx. The omo-hyoid muscle was therefore divided, and the
     artery ligatured beneath, in order to ensure against any
     interference with the sac. Some difficulty was met with, for on
     opening the vascular cleft the vein was exposed and found to
     completely overlie the artery: although it was on the left side
     of the neck, the position of the vein was so completely
     superficial that there seemed no doubt that it had been
     displaced by the development of the aneurismal sac. A striking
     appearance was noted on exposure of the vein, the coats of
     which vibrated visibly, quivering in exact consonance with the
     palpable thrill. On tightening the silk ligature all pulsation
     ceased in the aneurism, and the vibratory thrill in the vein
     became much lessened.

     The patient made a good recovery, only disturbed by a slight
     attack of vomiting, and at the end of a week the wound had
     healed, and pulsation in the aneurism had completely ceased.
     The thrill persisted as before.

Six months later, a small sac still exists beneath the sterno-mastoid. The pulse still reaches
110-120 in pace. The purring thrill is very slight. The condition gives rise to little or no
trouble. Pulsation is strong in the external carotid artery, there is little in the common
carotid. The voice is strong and good. This aneurism is either at the bifurcation of the common
carotid, or on the immediate commencement of the internal carotid. Ligature of the external
carotid will probably cure it.

     (11) Arterio-venous aneurism, probably affecting both
     carotids. Wounded at Paardeberg. Entry (Mauser), at dimple
     of chin immediately below mandibular symphysis. Exit, at
     margin of right trapezius, the track crossing the carotids
     about the level of normal bifurcation. The patient was lying on
     his back with the head down when struck. Some hæmorrhage from
     the exit wound occurred at the time, and later on the way to
     Jacobsdal this was so profuse as to be nearly fatal. A
     considerable hæmorrhage also occurred on the tenth day. The
     patient made the journey to Modder River safely, and was then
     under the charge of Mr. Cheatle. A large diffuse pulsating
     swelling developed on the right side of the neck, with
     well-marked thrill and machinery murmur. During the next three
     weeks the swelling steadily contracted, and the patient was
     sent down to the Base one month after receiving the wound, when
     the condition was as follows. There is no evidence of any
     fracture of the jaw. On the right side of the neck a large
     aneurism fills the carotid triangle, extending from the
     mid-line backwards to the margin of the trapezius, and from the
     level of the top of the larynx upwards to the margin of the
     mandible. The wall is fairly firm, pulsation is both visible
     and palpable, and a well-marked thrill and machinery murmur are
     present. The latter annoys him by its buzzing when the head
     rests on the right side. The pupils are equal. Pulse somewhat
     irritable, about 100. The voice is weak and husky, and there is
     difficulty in swallowing solids. The actual swelling is
     somewhat remarkable in outline, on the one hand following up
     the course of the external carotid and facial arteries, and on
     the other extending backwards in the line of the wound track
     towards the exit. The patient was kept on his back with
     sandbags around the head during the next fortnight. For the
     first eight days such change as occurred was in the direction
     of localisation and contraction, but during the last six,
     evident extension occurred both backwards and downwards; this
     extension was accompanied by severe pain in the cutaneous
     cervical nerve area of the neck. The larynx became pushed over
     3/4 of an inch to the left of the median line, and the
     extension beneath the sterno-mastoid downwards raised a doubt
     as to whether the common carotid could be exposed without
     encroaching on the walls of the sac. Owing to indisposition I
     had not been able to see the patient for some days, but now,
     after consultation with Major Simpson and Mr. Watson, it was
     decided that the best plan would be to expose and tie the
     common carotid as high as could be safely done. The operation
     was performed six weeks after the injury, and somewhat to our
     surprise offered little difficulty. The carotid was exposed at
     the upper border of the omo-hyoid, only a small amount of
     infiltration having occurred in the vascular cleft. No
     dilatation of the jugular was noticeable, and when a silk
     ligature was applied to the artery all pulsation was
     controlled, and the thrill in the vein disappeared completely.
     The after progress was satisfactory, but four days later the
     wound was dressed, as the patient's temperature had risen above
     100°. The tumour was consolidated: no pulsation could be felt,
     but there was little apparent diminution in its size. A loud
     blowing murmur was audible, especially at the posterior part of
     the swelling.

     On the morning of the fifth day the patient mentioned that he
     again heard the whirr during the night. There had been no sign
     of any cerebral disturbance and the pupils had remained equal
     throughout.

     A week after the operation the stitches were removed, there was
     evidence of some blood clot in the lower part of the wound, and
     this later liquefied and was let out on the eleventh day. At
     that time a slight bubbling thrill could be felt at the upper
     part of the tumour, also slight pulsation in the line of the
     external carotid and at the most posterior part of the sac. The
     latter was much contracted, diminished in size and apparently
     solid, so that it was hoped that such pulsation as existed was
     communicated. Ten months later, no trace of the aneurismal sac
     exists. Neck normal, except for purring thrill. Voice strong
     and good. Pulse 100. Following his usual work.

     (12) Carotid arterio-venous aneurism.--Wounded at Paardeberg.
     Aperture of entry (Mauser), at the posterior border of the
     left sterno-mastoid, 1 inch above the clavicle; exit, near
     the posterior border of the right sterno-mastoid, 2 inches from
     the sterno-clavicular joint. The injury was followed by very
     free hæmorrhage, mainly from the wound of entry, some 'quarts'
     of blood escaping; at any rate his clothes were saturated. The
     voice was hoarse and weak, and there was much difficulty in
     swallowing; for the first twenty-four hours he could swallow
     nothing, but gradual improvement took place. The patient was
     carried two miles to the Field hospital, and three days later
     travelled 36-40 miles in a bullock waggon to Modder River.
     Thence he travelled to Orange River 55 miles by train on the
     next day. A swelling was first noted when the wound was dressed
     some seven days after the injury. No evidence was ever existent
     of gross damage to either trachea or oesophagus beyond the
     initial dysphagia. The hoarseness of voice due to left
     laryngeal paralysis slowly improved, and was probably the
     effect of concussion or contusion of the left recurrent
     laryngeal nerve. During the patient's stay at Orange River a
     large pulsating swelling with a strong thrill developed. This
     was at first diffuse, but under the influence of rest it
     steadily contracted and localised. During this period the
     patient was seen several times by Mr. Cheatle, who noted
     considerable temporary enlargement of the thyroid gland.

     At the end of eight weeks he had been allowed up some days, and
     travelled 570 miles to Wynberg. The aneurism was about 1-1/2
     inch in diameter, smooth and rounded, extending just beneath
     the left clavicle and nearly the whole width of the
     sterno-mastoid, but well defined in all directions. There was
     well-marked expansile pulsation, purring thrill along the
     jugular vein and over the tumour, and loud machinery murmur
     widely diffused along the whole neck and into the thorax. The
     voice was still weak and husky, but there was no dysphagia or
     dyspnoea. The left pupil was larger than the right.

     The patient acquired enteric fever at Wynberg and when
     convalescent was sent to Netley, whence he returned home. The
     aneurism caused little discomfort. It may possibly have been of
     the inferior thyroid artery.

     (13) Innominate arterio-venous varix.--Wounded at Modder
     River. Entry (Mauser) posterior margin of left
     sterno-mastoid, close above the clavicle. Exit in anterior
     axillary line one inch below the right anterior axillary fold.
     Soon after the injury a considerable amount of blood was
     coughed up, and occasional hæmoptysis persisted for the next
     four days. The patient was moved from the Field hospital by
     train to Orange River, a journey of 55 miles and some four
     hours' duration, on the fourth day. When examined there was
     slight fulness over an area roughly circular and about 2-1/2
     inches in extent, of which the sterno-clavicular joint lay just
     within the centre. Over this area there was faint pulsation
     with a strongly marked thrill and loud systolic bruit. The
     radial pulses were even, the right pupil larger than the left.
     No pain, and no dyspnoea. The right eye was partially closed,
     but could be opened by the levator palpebræ superioris. The
     patient was shortly afterwards sent to the Base, and when seen
     there twenty-five days after the injury, there was little
     change in the condition except that the fulness had
     disappeared, the thrill was more marked, and a typical
     machinery murmur transmitted along both carotid and subclavian
     arteries had developed. There was no headache and the man
     himself did not notice the bruit. Evidence of mediastinal
     hæmorrhage existed in the presence of subcutaneous
     discoloration of the abdominal wall, below the ensiform
     cartilage and extending slightly over the costal margin of the
     thorax. In the absence of an aneurismal swelling, or of the
     development of any further symptoms, the patient was sent home
     to Netley in January.

I saw this patient in Glasgow a year later. He was employed as a lamplighter, and was able
to do his work well, only complaining of attacks of shortness of breath on exertion. He said
these were apt to come on each evening about 6 P.M. The pulse was 100 when the erect position
was maintained, and 84 to 88 in the sitting posture. The right pupil was still dilated, reacting
for accommodation but little to light. The palpebral fissure was normal in size and there was
little, if any, diminution in strength of the right radial pulse.

On inspection no pulsation was visible; in fact, the pulsation of the normal left subclavian
was more apparent in the posterior triangle of that side. The sterno-mastoid was prominent,
also the sternal third of the clavicle. On firm pressure some pulsation was palpable beneath
the sterno-mastoid, but no definite evidence of the presence of a sac could be detected. Purring
thrill and machinery murmur were still present, but the former was slight, and palpable only
with the lightest pressure. The machinery murmur had ceased to be audible to himself, and was
by no means loud or very widely distributed.

The condition had, in fact, steadily improved, and become far less obvious. The prominence
of the sterno-mastoid and clavicle still present was difficult of explanation, except on the
theory of an injury to the bone, or that an aneurismal sac had consolidated spontaneously.

     (14) Arterio-venous aneurism, root of right carotid.--Wounded
     at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), centre of right
     infra-spinous fossa. Exit, 3/4 of an inch above clavicle,
     through point of junction of the heads of the right
     sterno-mastoid muscle. Range 200-300 yards. When wounded the
     man ran two hundred yards to seek cover. There was no serious
     external hæmorrhage, but the injury was followed by some
     difficulty in swallowing, and hæmoptysis, which lasted for the
     first two days. The right radial pulse was noted to be smaller
     than the left, and weakness in flexion of the fingers, with
     hyperæsthesia in the ulnar nerve distribution, was observed.
     The right pupil was also noted to be larger than the left.

     The patient was sent down to the Base, and on the twenty-fourth
     day the condition was as follows. A pulsating swelling existed
     extending 1-1/4 inch upwards beneath the right sterno-mastoid,
     from the mid line of the neck backwards to the centre of the
     posterior triangle, and downwards over 2 inches of the first
     intercostal space, which latter was dull on percussion. There
     was some evidence of a bounding wall, but it was thin and the
     tumour was soft and yielding. A loud machinery murmur was
     audible over the tumour, over nearly the whole extent of the
     thorax, and in the distal vessels as far as the temporal
     upwards, and the brachial as far down as the bend of the elbow.
     The murmur was audible to the patient with his ears closed.
     Over the swelling a strong thrill was palpable; this extended
     some little distance into the distal vessels and felt
     remarkably superficial. It was particularly evident in the line
     and course of the anterior jugular vein, and appeared to be
     extinguished by local pressure. Although readily felt in the
     posterior triangle, it was impalpable on deep pressure in the
     suprasternal notch, a fact which seemed in favour of localising
     the aneurismal varix to the subclavian artery and vein. The
     right pulse was good, although smaller than the left, and was
     said to have improved in volume. The right pupil was slightly
     larger than the left, but reacted normally. There was no pain
     or difficulty in swallowing. Weakness in power of flexion of
     the fingers persisted, and there was some impairment of
     sensation in the area of distribution of the ulnar nerve.

     Three weeks later no material change had occurred, except that
     the swelling was perhaps softer and the thrill more
     superficial, and at the end of two months the patient was sent
     to England.

I saw this patient a year later in Glasgow, when the condition was as follows. He was living
at home, and out of employment. He complained of shortness of breath on exertion, and said
that when he mounted stairs he felt 'as if his heart were going to leave him.' The heart's
apex beat in the sixth interspace in the nipple line, and the precordial dulness was somewhat
increased. The pulse numbered 80 to 84. The muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve were very weak,
but not much wasted, and ulnar sensation was imperfect.

The aneurism had considerably altered in form and outline; its walls were dense and firm; it
extended 2-1/2 inches upwards in the line of the carotid artery, beneath the sterno-mastoid,
but projected beyond the posterior border of that muscle. The larynx was displaced 1/2 an inch
to the left of the median line; the voice was still husky, although much stronger than it was;
the anterior jugular vein was dilated. The purring thrill was very superficial, and chiefly
palpable over the subclavian vessels. The machinery murmur was still loud, but much less widely
distributed than before; it was still audible to the patient when he lay on his right side.

This case was of much interest from the diagnostic point of view. When I first saw the patient
I considered the injury to have implicated the innominate vessels. Later, from the facts that
the thrill was imperceptible in the episternal notch, and that the main part of the tumour
was situated in the posterior triangle, that the wound was of the root of the right subclavian
vessels.

It now appears that, at any rate, the root of the right carotid is the artery implicated.

In spite of the continued existence of a large aneurism, the localisation of the sac, which
had taken place, was very striking, considering that the man had been walking about freely,
and living an ordinary life, except that he had undertaken no work.

     (15) Popliteal arterio-venous aneurism.--Wounded at
     Paardeberg. Entry (Mauser), at lower margin of patella.
     Exit, at centre of back of thigh. Perforation of lower end of
     femur. The patient was lying down with crossed knees when the
     injury was received. Much oedema of the foot and leg followed
     the injury, and on the third day a thrill was discovered. Three
     weeks later there was still some swelling of the calf, the
     posterior tibial pulse was imperceptible, the anterior very
     small. An aneurism was palpable at the inner part of the top of
     the popliteal space, about the size of a pigeon's egg; a strong
     thrill was to be felt, especially when the knee was flexed, and
     with this expansile pulsation and a loud machinery murmur. The
     entry wound was firmly healed; the exit still furnished
     blood-stained serous discharge. The synovial cavity of the knee
     was distended and doughy on palpation. During the next three
     weeks the aneurism contracted considerably and the patient was
     sent home.

     When admitted to the Herbert Hospital the patient complained
     chiefly of pains in the foot and leg. The aneurism was cured by
     ligation of the vein above and below the communication and
     proximal ligature of the popliteal artery.[15]

     (16) 'Femoral arterio-venous aneurism.--A private of the West
     Yorkshire Regiment was hit on February 11, 1900, at Monte
     Christo by a bullet which passed through the inner border of
     his right thigh above its middle. On arrival at Woolwich the
     patient was found to have a varicose aneurism at the upper end
     of Hunter's canal. On May 31 the femoral artery was ligatured
     just above its communication with the vein, and as this stopped
     all pulsation in the vein, it was decided to postpone ligature
     of the latter to a subsequent occasion, if it should ever be
     necessary; such a procedure would, it was thought, interfere
     less with the circulation of the limb, and would therefore be
     less likely to be followed by gangrene, which is so frequent a
     result of high ligature of the femoral. But a few days after
     the operation the foot became cold and mummified, and there
     was no alternative but to amputate the limb through the
     condyles of the femur. From this operation the patient made a
     good recovery, and when discharged there was no sign of an
     aneurism of the vein.'

Case 16 is quoted from a paper in the Lancet by Lieut.-Colonel Lewtas, I.M.S. It illustrates
a result with which I became acquainted in three other instances not under my own observation.

ANEURISMAL VARICES

     (17) Axillary.--Wounded at Modder River. Entry (Mauser), at
     inner margin of front of left arm, just below level of junction
     of axillary fold. Exit, at about centre of hollow of axilla.
     A month later when the wound was healed a typical thrill and
     machinery murmur were noticed. The latter was audible down to
     the elbow and upwards into the neck. The radial pulse appeared
     normal. No swelling or pulsation existed. At the end of three
     months the condition was unaltered; the patient said he noticed
     nothing abnormal in his arm, except that it was sometimes 'sort
     of numb' at night.

     (18) Popliteal.--Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser),
     in centre of popliteal space. Exit, about centre of patella,
     which latter was cleanly perforated. Three weeks later the
     typical thickening of the knee-joint following hæmarthrosis was
     present, also a well-marked thrill and machinery murmur in the
     popliteal vessels with no evidence of a tumour. The leg was
     normal except for slight enlargement of the internal saphenous
     vein and its branches, probably independent of the arterial
     lesion.

     (19) Femoral.--Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), 7
     inches below left anterior superior iliac spine. Exit, at
     inner aspect of thigh. One month later slight fulness without
     pulsation was discovered on the inner side of the femoral
     vessels just above the level of the wound track. Some
     blood-staining still remained in the fold between the scrotum
     and thigh. Machinery murmur and a well-marked thrill, most
     palpable to the inner side of the superficial femoral artery,
     were noted. No further symptoms developed and the patient was
     sent home.

Prognosis and treatment.--No one can help being struck with the disinclination shown by the
older surgeons to interference in cases of either aneurismal varix or varicose aneurism, even
after the time that ligation of the vessels had become a favourite and successful operation.
The objections lay in the technical difficulties of local treatment, and the danger of gangrene
after proximal ligature. Modern surgery has lightened the difficulties under which our predecessors
approached these operations, but none the less the experience in this campaign fully supports
the objections to indiscriminate and ill-timed surgical interference, as accidents have followed
both direct local and proximal ligature.

In pure varix no doubt can exist as to the advisability of non-interference in the early stage,
in the absence of symptoms. This is the more evident when we bear in mind that a stage in which
an aneurismal sac exists can seldom be absent. In many cases an expectant attitude may lead
to the conviction that no interference is necessary, especially in certain situations where
the danger of gangrene has been fully demonstrated. In connection with this subject I cannot
help recalling the first case of femoral varix that ever came under my own observation. I discovered
the condition accidentally in a man admitted into the hospital for other reasons. The patient
remarked: 'For heaven's sake, sir, do not say anything about that. I have had it many years,
and it has never given any trouble. If it is known, I shall be worried to death by people examining
it.'

None the less it must be borne in mind that beyond enlargement of the vein dilatation of the
artery above the seat of obstruction does occur, and gives trouble in some situations. Again
the disturbance of the general circulation already adverted to shows that the existence of
this condition is sometimes of importance in its influence on the cardiac action.

Under these circumstances the treatment varies with regard to the vessels affected, and the
degree of disturbance the condition gives rise to.

With regard to locality, experience appears to have shown clearly that communications between
the carotid arteries and jugular veins usually give rise to so little serious trouble that,
in view of the grave nature of the operation and its possible after consequences on the brain,
interference is as a rule better avoided. I should, however, be inclined to draw a distinction
between operations on the common and internal carotid arteries in this particular, and should
regard varix of the latter vessel and the internal jugular vein as especially undesirable for
interference.

The vessels at the root of the neck are probably to be regarded from the same point of view,
as to surgical interference.

The arteries of the upper extremity are the most suitable for operation, and the axillary may
perhaps be the vessel in which interference is most likely to be useful. In this relation it
may be of interest to include here a case of a man who took part in the campaign when already
the subject of an aneurismal varix of the axillary artery.

     (20) Twenty years previously the patient suffered a punctured
     wound of the left axilla from a pencil. A varix developed, but
     was only discovered by accident ten years later. The patient
     was seen by several surgeons, and treatment was discussed; the
     balance of opinion was, however, in favour of non-interference,
     and nothing was done beyond giving injunctions as to care in
     the use of the limb. Up to the time of discovery of the varix
     no inconvenience had been felt, although the patient was of
     athletic habits. Subsequently, the patient himself was positive
     that a swelling existed, but he pursued his usual work. In
     1899-1900 he took part in the operations in South Africa as a
     combatant, and during this time was subjected to very hard
     manual work. During this he was seized with sudden pain in the
     left side of the head and neck, and in consequence invalided.
     No restriction in the movements of the upper extremity, and no
     subcutaneous ecchymosis developed, but the patient was positive
     as to the tumour having greatly enlarged.

     Four months later the condition was little altered. A pulsating
     swelling 1-1/2 inch broad existed along the line of the upper
     two-thirds of the axillary artery, and along the subclavian in
     the neck, rising some 1-1/2 inch into the posterior triangle.
     Pulsation was visible; the murmur was audible when sitting
     beside the patient, and widely distributed over the whole
     chest, the neck, and upper extremity on auscultation. The pulse
     rate varied with the mental condition of the patient, which was
     excitable, between 96 and 120. There was neuralgic pain in the
     neck and scalp, and down the distribution of the brachial
     plexus. The pupils were equal, but flushing of the face and
     profuse sweating followed any exertion. I concluded the tumour
     in this case to be mainly due to dilatation of the trunk above
     the point of obstruction on account of its outline, the absence
     of any restriction of movement in the upper extremity, and the
     non-occurrence of subcutaneous ecchymosis at the time of the
     attack of severe pain. Difficulties arose as to undertaking any
     active form of treatment for this patient, which, to be
     satisfactory, needed an antecedent period of absolute rest, and
     he passed from my observation. I think, however, operation by
     ligature above and below the communication would have been
     possible. The case affords a good example of the course the
     condition may sometimes take if precaution is neglected.

The vessels of the arm or forearm may in almost all cases be interfered with, but in many instances
an absence of any serious symptom renders operation unnecessary.

With regard to the femoral varices, I would refer to the remarks below, and those on the treatment
of varicose aneurism as indicating that a certain amount of caution should be exercised in
interfering with them.

The same remarks in a lesser degree apply to the popliteal vessels. In the leg the tibials
may readily and safely be attacked, but it may be mentioned that the widespread and diffused
nature of the thrill may in some cases give rise to considerable difficulty in sharp localisation
of the varix to either of the vessels, or to any particular spot in their course. In one case
in my experience the posterior tibial was cut down upon, when the varix was probably peroneal
in situation.

The operation most in favour consists in ligation of the artery above and below the varix,
the vein remaining untouched. Even this operation, however, in two cases of femoral varix failed
to effect more than a temporary cessation of the symptoms, although the ligatures were placed
but a short distance from the communication. Failure is due to the presence of collateral branches,
which are not easy of detection. Even when the vessels lie exposed, the even distribution of
the thrill renders determination of the exact point of communication difficult, and the difficulty
is augmented by the temporary arrest of the thrill following the application of a proximal
ligature to the artery. A successful case is reported by Deputy Inspector-General H. T. Cox,
R.N., in which the ligatures were placed 1/2 an inch from the point of communication.[16] Single
ligation, or proximal ligature, is useless.

If the vein cannot be spared, excision of a limited part of both vessels may be preferable,
particularly in those of the upper extremity.

Proximal ligation of the artery combined with double ligature of the vein, as adopted in case
15 by Colonel Lewtas for a varicose aneurism, might offer advantages in some situations.

Given suitable surroundings and certain diagnosis, the ideal treatment of this condition, as
of the next, is preventive--i.e. primary ligation of the wounded artery. Many difficulties,
however, lie in the way of this beyond mere unsatisfactory surroundings. It suffices to mention
the two chief: uncertainty as to the vessel wounded, and the necessity of always ligaturing
the vein as well as the artery in a limb often more or less dissected up by extravasated blood,
to show that this will never be resorted to as routine treatment.

Arterio-venous aneurism.--Many of the remarks in the last section find equal application here,
but in the presence of an aneurismal sac non-intervention is rarely possible or advisable.
In the early stages the proper treatment in any case consists in placing the patient in as
complete a condition of rest as possible, and affording local support to the limb by a splint,
preferably a removable plaster-of-Paris case. Should no further extension, or, what is more
likely, should contraction and diminution occur, it will be well to continue this treatment
for some weeks at least.

When the aneurism has reached a quiescent stage the question of further treatment arises, and
whether this should consist in local interference or proximal ligature. The answer to this
mainly depends on the size and situation of the vessels concerned. To take of the cases above
described the five instances in which the cervical vessels were the seat of the aneurism. In
No. 13 the symptoms appeared fairly conclusive of the injury being to the innominate artery
and vein, or possibly innominate artery and jugular vein. Fortunately the aneurismal sac in
this case was small and showed a tendency to decrease, but in any case no interference would
have been justifiable. I think a similar opinion was unavoidable in No. 14, probably affecting
the root of the right carotid. Here under any circumstances interference would have been most
hazardous. The position of large aneurism made the route of approach to the wounded spot necessarily
through the sac, exposing the patient to the double danger of immediate hæmorrhage and of entrance
of air into the great veins. Nos. 10, 11, and 12 fall into the same category, except that in
No. 11 the immediate indication for interference was extension. In each, ligature of the artery
above and below the point of communication would have necessitated so near an approach to the
sac which must remain in communication with the vein as to have entailed injury to the latter,
when both artery and vein must have been ligatured, probably risking serious cerebral trouble.
In No. 11 I believe both the external and internal carotids were implicated; in No. 10 I believe
the internal alone, close to its origin. The operation of proximal ligature ensured primary
consolidation of the sac in both cases 10 and 11, but left the thrill unaltered, except in
so far as it was temporarily weakened. It, in fact, converted these cases from arterio-venous
aneurisms into pure aneurismal varices. In No. 10 a sac subsequently redeveloped. No. 12 stood
on a different basis. No operation was done for him in South Africa, but the first portion
of the carotid might have been ligatured in the episternal notch, or by aid of removal of a
part of the sternum, and a second ligature placed above the sac. Here a ligature above and
below the communication would have been comparatively easy.

As a general rule proximal ligature is to be reserved for those cases alone in which double
ligature is either impracticable or inadvisable, and it can only be expected to convert a varicose
aneurism into the less dangerous condition of aneurismal varix.

In the case of arterio-venous aneurisms in the limbs the possibilities of treatment are enlarged,
and here the alternatives of (a) local interference with the sac and direct ligature of the
wounded point, (b) simple ligature above and below the sac, (c) proximal ligature (Hunterian
operation), come into consideration.

Direct incision of the sac is suitable, and the best method of treatment for aneurisms in the
calf, forearm, and probably arm. Several cases in the two former situations were successfully
treated by this method. On the other hand, the only case I saw in which a proximal ligature
had been applied for an arterio-venous aneurism of the leg resulted most unsatisfactorily.
The sac in the calf suppurated at a later date, and for many weeks the escape of small quantities
of blood from the remaining sinus kept up the fear of a severe attack of secondary hæmorrhage
until the sinus closed.

In the case of femoral and popliteal aneurisms the method of Antyllus is often unsuitable.
A case of arterio-venous aneurism of the femoral artery quoted in the Lancet[17] will illustrate
the difficulty which may be met with in determining the actual bleeding point in the irregular
cavity laid open. In any case the necessary ligature of both artery and vein is a serious objection
to the direct method either in the thigh or ham, and more particularly if adopted before the
damage dependent on the dissection of the limb by extravasated blood has been repaired.

Proximal ligature (Hunterian) even, offers dangers under these circumstances. In one case with
which I became acquainted, it was followed by gangrene, necessitating amputation. The lesion
in this instance was a perforating one of the femoral artery and vein.

For either femoral or popliteal arterio-venous aneurisms ligature of the artery above and below
the aneurism is the best and safest treatment. In view of the healthy state of the vascular
wall in most of these cases, the advantage of placing the ligatures as near to the wounded
spot as can be managed without interference with the sac is afforded. A number of popliteal
cases treated in this way did perfectly. In the femoral cases a considerable period of rest
to allow of consolidation of the sac, and readjustment of the circulation, should always be
allowed to elapse.

In the case of popliteal arterio-venous aneurisms a number were successfully treated by proximal
(Hunterian) ligature, and by single ligature immediately above the sac. In a considerable proportion
of the latter both artery and vein were tied. This was apparently the result of the difficulty
of isolating the vessels in the tangled mass of clot and cicatricial tissue surrounding them,
and is a strong argument against too early interference. The late Sir William Stokes expressed
himself as in favour of ligature of the artery in Hunter's canal, combined with that of the
great anastomotic branch, and quoted some successful cases to me. I have grave doubts, however,
whether the varix can often be permanently cured by this operation.

I can give no useful statistics on this subject, but with regard to the popliteal aneurisms
I may state that in three instances gangrene of the leg followed early operative interference
in the popliteal space.

My own opinion on this subject is strong, and to the effect that none of these operations should
be undertaken before a period of from two to three months after the injury, unless there is
evidence of progressive enlargement. In every case which came under my own observation progressive
contraction and consolidation took place up to a certain point under the influence of rest.
When this process has become stationary, and the surrounding tissues have regained to a great
extent their normal condition, the operations are far easier, and beyond this more likely to
be followed by success.

It appears to me that one argument only can be raised against the above opinion, viz. the possibility
of healing of the recent wound in the vessels when the force of the circulation is lowered
by proximal ligature. Such experience as that quoted from Sir W. Stokes and two of Mr. Ker's
cases, mentioned below, support this possibility, but in all the reported results were recent.
Against them I can only advance my knowledge of several mishaps following early operation.

In concluding these observations on injuries to the arteries and aneurisms, a few general remarks
as to the occurrence of gangrene after operation must be added. This was not uncommon, and
in the main was no doubt attributable--(1) to the lowering of the vitality of the surrounding
tissues by creeping blood extravasation, and sometimes to actual pressure by the extravasation
on the vessels necessary for the establishment of the collateral circulation. (2) To the frequency
with which both artery and vein required to be ligatured.

Beyond these common causes, however, others must be advanced, dependent on the general and
local condition of the nervous system in these cases. In general mental state many of the patients
were much shaken, and in others the condition spoken of as local shock in a former chapter
had been marked. In a third series obvious individual nerve lesions were co-existent with those
to the vessels. Beyond this a fourth nervous element of unknown quantity, the effect of the
form of injury on the vaso-motor nerves accompanying the great vessels, must be taken into
consideration.

I believe all these factors were of importance, since it appeared to me that gangrene occurred
more often than I should have expected. In one case which I have heard of, gangrene followed
a very slight injury to the foot in a patient who had apparently made an excellent recovery
after ligature of the femoral artery.

The nervous factor seems another element in favour of reasonable delay in active interference
with traumatic aneurisms of the above varieties in the absence of threatening symptoms.

It is worthy of remark that no case of gangrene due to aneurism came under my notice, except
subsequently to operation.

Since the above chapter was written, my friend, Mr. J. E. Ker, has sent me his experience in
the treatment of four aneurisms, which is of such interest that I insert it as an addendum.

Arterial hæmatomata.--(1) Popliteal, treated by local incision. Both artery and vein completely
divided. Ligature of the four ends. Cure. (2) Traumatic aneurism of upper third of forearm.
Treated by rest and pressure by bandage. On the eighth day pulsation and bruit ceased spontaneously,
and the remains of the sac steadily consolidated until the man's discharge on the twenty-sixth day.

Arterio-venous aneurisms.--(1) At junction of brachial and axillary arteries. Proximal ligature.
Cure. (2) Arterio-venous aneurism at the bend of the elbow. Ligature of the brachial at the
junction of the middle and lower thirds of the arm. Cure.

CHAPTER V

INJURIES TO THE BONES OF THE LIMBS

Injuries to the bones of the limbs formed a very large proportion of the accidents we were
called upon to treat, and afforded as much interest as any class, since they possessed many
special features. I shall hope to show, however, as in some of the other injuries, that these
features differed only in degree from those exhibited by injuries from the old leaden bullets
of larger calibre, although with few exceptions they were of a distinctly more favourable character.

It is of considerable interest to note that, taking the fractures as a whole, there was a somewhat
striking change in their nature during the earlier and later portions of the campaign. In the
earlier stages I think there is no doubt that punctured fractures were proportionately more
common than in the later, when comminuted fractures were much more often seen. There was, I
believe, a source of error in this opinion, as far as I myself was concerned, in that the first
cases I saw were at Capetown and had come from Natal. There is no doubt that the punctured
fractures were earlier fit to travel, and hence a larger number of them found their way to
the Base hospitals at a period when the comminuted fractures were still in the Field or Stationary
hospitals. I do not, however, rely on the cases seen at Capetown alone for my opinion, as while
at the front I saw the same large proportion of clean punctures in the early engagements of
the Kimberley relief force.

I am inclined to attribute the change to two reasons: first, I believe that the use of regulation
weapons was more universal in the earlier part of the war, while later, as more men were engaged,
the Martini-Henry came more into evidence, and the Boers took more freely to the use of sporting
rifles and ammunition. Another element also in the less clean punctures of the short and cancellous
bones was probably the less accurate and hard shooting of the Mauser rifles as they became
worn; the bullets seemed to evidence this by the comparative shallowness of their rifle grooves,
which, I take it, would mean less velocity and accuracy in flight. This would be of importance,
since the clean puncture of cancellous bone was no doubt favoured by a high rate of velocity.

The special features of the fractures caused by the small-calibre bullets were: (1) The nature
of the exit wound, which in a certain proportion of the cases exhibited the so-called 'explosive'
character. (2) The presence, in a marked degree in the severe cases, of the condition spoken
of in Chapter III. as 'local shock.' (3) The striking contrast of clean perforation and extreme
comminution in different cases. (4) The occasional occurrence of fractures of a very high degree
of longitudinal obliquity. (5) The rarity of any that could be termed transverse fractures.
(6) The general tendency of longitudinal fissuring when it occurred to stop short of the articular
extremities of the bones.

It will perhaps be most convenient to consider first the explanation of the development of
the so-called explosive apertures, and then to pass on to a general consideration of the types
of fracture commonly met with, before proceeding to the description of the injuries to the
separate bones.

Explosive wounds in connection with fractures.--The aperture of entry in these injuries presented
little or no deviation from the normal, unless it was due to the passage of ricochet bullets,
when it might be very irregular, but usually not of great size.

The aperture of exit offered special features beyond simple increase in size. First of all,
as in the small type wounds, the actual extent of destruction of the skin was small, this having
been projected outwards by the passing bullet and then either burst or torn by the bullet and
accompanying bony fragments. Fig. 47 well illustrates this feature. A triangular tongue of
skin was lifted by the passing bullet and probably by the lower end of the upper fragment of
the fractured ulna; through the resulting opening a mass of soft tissues and bone fragments,
bound together by an infiltration of coagulated blood, was extruded, separating the lateral
lips of the aperture, while the original tongue has shortened and retracted up to the top of
the wound.

The small extent of skin actually destroyed is an important element in the rapid contraction
often seen in these wounds when they progress favourably. Thus the large wound portrayed in
fig. 48 contracted to one-fourth its original size ten days after the diagram and measurements
were made. The large mass of protruded tissue was often most striking when a muscle such as
the biceps in fig. 48 had been divided; but the herniæ were more persistent when the mass projected
in regions where tendons formed a large integral constituent, as at the wrist or lower third
of the forearm. The protruding tissues naturally consisted of many varieties, according to
what lay in the track of any particular wound.

It should be added that for 'explosive' features to reach their strongest development, it is
necessary that the bone affected should lie near the surface of the body; hence the most characteristic
explosive wounds were met with in the forearm or leg, over the metacarpus or metatarsus, or
in the arm. In the thigh, on the other hand, where the femur in a great part of its course
not only lies deeply, but is also protected by particularly strong and resistent skin and fascia,
another type of wound was met with. The explosive exit aperture, although large, was still
only moderate in extent, sometimes, as in the front of the lower third, exposing a somewhat
angular large track walled by the divided quadriceps extensor cruris. In other cases, on introducing
the finger through a moderate exit opening on the inner aspect of the thigh, a large cavity,
sometimes 4 or 5 inches in diameter, was discovered, full of clot and shreds of destroyed tissue
and lined by a layer of similar material. In either of these latter cases the fractured bone
ends were situated too deeply to take part in the actual laceration of the skin, while the
force transmitted to the bone fragments, although sufficient to cause them to widely destroy
the first soft tissues met with, did not suffice to cause them to burst or lacerate the skin
widely.

With regard to the theories of the production of these phenomena, that of the transmission
of a part of the force of the bullet to the comminuted fragments, which thus themselves acquire
the characters of secondary projectiles, seems quite adequate.[18] Examination of any of the
skiagrams in which considerable comminution has taken place, shows that the fragments are carried
forward and perforate the tissues distal to the fracture.

Fig. 49, although a poor delineation of the actual condition, shows well the possible action
of projected fragments, even after they have been driven from the wound. In this case either
a large or a ricochet bullet entered on the outer aspect of the upper third of the left tibia;
it produced a severe comminuted fracture, the fragments from which, together with the deformed
bullet, then struck and perforated the upper third of the right tibia. A large irregular entry
wound 5 inches in transverse diameter was produced in the second limb together with a comminuted
fracture of the bone. The right limb had eventually to be amputated for secondary hæmorrhage,
but I am unacquainted with the later history of the patient.

The mode of displacement of the lateral fragments when a wide shaft such as that of the femur
is struck, throws some light on that of the displacement of soft tissues such as the component
parts of a perforated nerve or artery. The bullet, passing through, expends the chief part
of its energy in driving before it the fragments produced in its direct course, while a minor
part of the energy is expended on displacing the lateral fragments, which are pushed to either
side without becoming separated from their periosteal attachment. The appearance, in fact,
somewhat suggests what might be expected were a small charge of dynamite introduced into the
centre of a small tunnel made across the shaft of the bone. Examination of some of the skiagrams
also illustrates another point of interest, viz. that a certain degree of recoil on the part
of the bone results from the blow, since in many of them portions of the mantle of the bullet
and bone fragments are seen in that portion of the track proximal to the fractured bone.

The importance of 'setting up' of the bullet is at once evident in relation to the production
of wounds of an explosive type in connection with fractures of the bones. There can be no doubt
that a considerable number of the most severe injuries we saw were produced by the various
soft-nosed or expanding forms of bullet, also that others of an equally serious nature were
produced by Martini-Henry or large leaden sporting bullets. Allowing for this, however, I think
a considerable proportion were the result of deformation from bony impact, or ricochet deformities
external to the body acquired by regulation Mauser bullets, and I think these bullets can be
quite as formidable as any of the sporting varieties met with. The soft-nose varieties of small
calibre may not set up enough to cause severe injury, while the large leaden bullets often
flatten out so completely as to lose all penetrating power. As far as my impressions went,
the small soft-nosed bullets needed to be travelling at a very considerable rate of velocity
to be dangerous. In the form of soft-nose Mauser employed, the soft-nose was too short to allow
of as successful a mushrooming of the bullet as often occurred with the regulation projectile,
because, as already explained, the mantle acquires increased stability from its closed base.

FRACTURES OF THE SHAFTS OF THE LONG BONES

Types of fracture.--The common types of fracture of shafts of the long bones are illustrated
diagrammatically in fig. 50. Of the whole series comminuted fractures were by far the most
frequently met with, while the various wedge-shaped forms were the most strongly characteristic
of the special form of injury in which we are interested.

1. Stellate comminuted fractures.--A shows the primary nature of the lesion in all comminuted
fractures of compact bone, consisting in the production of a number of radiating fissures,
which assume a stellate form of which the point of impact corresponds to the centre. B shows
an incomplete development of this form, the fragments being simply displaced laterally with
slight loss of substance, so as to simulate a real punctured fracture. An illustration of this
fracture produced by a bullet travelling at a low degree of velocity is seen in plate XXIII.,
which also shows the unaltered bullet lying in close proximity to the injured fibula.

The degree of comminution in these fractures depends first on the range of fire and consequent
striking force retained by the bullet, a high degree of velocity producing extreme comminution
of compact bone. The severity of the latter again may be influenced by the measure of resistance
dependent on the density and brittleness of any individual bone, or on the possession of the
same characters as a special property by the tissues of the man struck. Thus plate IV. shows
a fracture of the humerus produced by a bullet shot from a short range, and the fragments are
comparatively large and of even dimensions, while plate XIV. shows extreme comminution of the
portion of the femur exposed to direct impact, with elongated large fragments at the sides
of the track. Plate XIX. shows less extreme comminution and less separation of the fragments,
and was probably produced by a bullet from a longer range of fire.

The separation of elongated lateral fragments is a special feature, and best marked when the
portion of bone struck is considerably wider than the bullet, as in the case of the shaft of
the femur. These fragments correspond in the method of their production to those seen in the
wedge fractures described below, while their separation leaves a pointed extremity to either
segment of the shaft. This fracture in its purest type is, I believe, spoken of as the 'butterfly
fracture.'

With regard to the spread of the fissures in the long axis of the bone into neighbouring articulations
I think fractures produced by bullets of small calibre differ considerably from those produced
by larger projectiles, in that their general tendency is not to extend beyond the commencement
of the cancellous bone forming the joint end. This is perhaps capable of explanation on several
grounds: first, the smaller area of impact results in the assumption of a strongly marked stellate
figure, the radiating fissures of which rapidly reach the lateral limits of the shaft, producing
a solution of continuity in the bone which interrupts the continuance of the action of the
wedge represented by the bullet. Secondly, the small size of the wedge itself is opposed to
the wide separation of the parts directly implicated, which is necessary for the continued
progress of the process of fissuring, and again the rapidity of passage minimises the period
during which the force is exerted. It is in these points that I believe the chief differences
between the modern and old gunshot fractures find their explanation, since with the larger
bullets fractures extending from some distance into the joints were a somewhat special feature.
In addition it is probable that the alteration in structure at the junction of the shafts with
the cancellous ends also tends to check the regular extension of the fissures, as a similar
limitation is illustrated even in some fractures by Snider bullets. Fig. 51 of the lower end
of the femur illustrates a not uncommon lower limit to a comminuted injury in this region.

The degree and nature of the comminution also vary with the directness of impact on the part
of the bullet. The more nearly this approaches at a right angle, the more severe is the local
comminution, but probably a lesser area of the shaft is implicated. Plate V. shows an example
of this: all trace of continuity is lost, a wide gap separates the bone ends, while the fragments
themselves have been for the most part driven altogether out of the wound. Oblique impact,
on the other hand, may widen the comminuted area at the point of impact, while, if the bullet
retains sufficient force and regularity of outline, it may then travel 'cutting its way' through
the remainder of the bone in an oblique direction. It will be of course recognised that the
exact impact of the bullet depends not alone on the direction of the projectile, but also on
the nature of the slope offered by the surface of bone struck.

2. Wedge fractures.--This form (C and D, fig. 50) is equally characteristic of gunshot injury
with pure perforation; it is met with in two varieties. C illustrates the more strongly marked
type; in it the bullet makes passing lateral impact with the shaft, and from the point struck
radiating fissures extend to the opposite margin, so that a wedge-shaped piece of bone often
secondarily comminuted is separated from the remainder of the shaft; see plate X. of the radius.

The second variety, D, is an incomplete development of the stellate fracture in which the fissures
pass to one margin of the bone only. The explanation of this variation is probably to be sought
in the direction of impact on the part of the bullet, since the main fissure is often accompanied
by secondary lines which run a somewhat parallel course to the main one, and suggest the dispersion
of the force in the form of concentric waves. Such fractures were most strongly marked in the
tibia, the breadth of the surfaces of this bone presenting especially favourable conditions
for their production.

3. Notched fractures.--These may be a slight degree of the form of wedge fracture last described;
such a one is depicted in plate XXII. where a portion of the spine of the tibia has been carried
away by a passing bullet. Other notched fractures approximate themselves more nearly to perforations,
the notch being a groove secondary to the opening up of such a track as is shown in the illustration
of a perforation of the lower third of the shaft of the tibia (fig. 57 on p. 219). Notching
or grooving is naturally much more common in the cancellous portions of bones.

4. Oblique fractures.--These also occur in two varieties: the first has been already alluded
to; in it the bullet actually cuts an oblique track in the bone; the main line of fracture
is often considerably comminuted, usually at the proximal end of the track (see plates XV.
and XIX.).

The second variety (E, fig. 50) is less common; in it two of the main limbs of the simple stellate
figure are suppressed, while the remaining two form a continuous line from one margin of the
shaft to the other, the point of impact lying approximately in the centre of the line of fracture.
Such a fracture is illustrated by the skiagram of a femur in plate XVI. in which the bullet
traversed the soft parts transversely at the level of the centre of the fracture, which was
9 inches in length. In another case the line of fracture occupied the lower third of the femur,
passing from the inner border of the shaft, the lower end of the upper fragment was formed
by the compact tissue forming the outer wall of the external condyle. This latter perforated
the vastus externus and lay beneath the skin; as it could not be disentangled, an incision
was made over it, and the fragments when reduced were screwed together by Mr. S. W. F. Richardson.
In neither fracture was there any comminution. Such fractures most nearly resemble the oblique
or spiral ones met with in civil practice as the results of falls. In all the instances I observed
the patients were supported on the lower extremities at the time of the accident, and one can
only assume that a twist of the trunk consequent on the fall of the body diverts the most forcible
vibrations resulting from the impact of the bullet into one line, and thus produces a solution
of continuity of a simple oblique nature. In both the cases mentioned above the bullet was
probably travelling at a low degree of velocity; in the first it was a ricochet and was retained.
I never saw one of these fractures in the upper extremity.

Plate XXI. affords an excellent example of this mechanism. The patient was standing when struck,
and then fell backwards. An incomplete fissure 7 inches in length is seen to extend from an
otherwise pure perforation of the shaft of the tibia.

5. Transverse fractures.--Throughout these were of very rare occurrence. Plate XX. illustrates
a pure transverse fracture produced by passing contact of a bullet probably fired at a distance
not exceeding 400 yards, and which subsequently struck the fibula plumb and produced considerable
comminution. No fissure extended into the ankle-joint. Comminutions such as that illustrated
by plate V. more or less simulated transverse fractures, but I saw no examples of transverse
tracks comparable to the oblique ones described above 'cut through' the shaft of a bone.

6. Perforations.--Although these were common in cancellous bone, they were comparatively rare
in the compact shafts. I saw, however, complete pure perforations of the shafts of the tibia,
femur, clavicle, and other bones. These perforations were, I believe, always the result of
low degrees of velocity, and they took the place of simple transverse fractures of the 'cut'
variety. The apertures of entry and exit in the bones resembled in character those seen in
the soft parts, or in the bones of the skull in low-velocity injuries (see figs. 71 and 72,
p. 261). The entry was more or less cleanly cut, while at the exit a plate of bone was raised,
and either separated or turned back on a hinge by the bullet (fig. 52), (plate XVII.) Such
a projecting hinged fragment was sometimes a source of some trouble; thus in a case of postero-anterior
perforation of the lower third of the shaft of the femur, the long exit fragment projected
into the substance of the quadriceps extensor muscle, and interfered with flexion of the knee-joint.
Fig. 57 of a superficial tunnel of the lower third of the tibia is especially interesting as
bringing such injuries of the long bones into line with fractures of the flat bones of the
skull, such as are illustrated in fig. 68, p. 259.

Plate XXI. affords an excellent example of perforation of the shaft of the tibia, although
complicated by the secondary fissure.

Plates XXIII., VIII., and III., of the fibula, humerus, and clavicle, exhibit examples of what
may be called spurious perforations of the shafts of bones, since comminution or loss of continuity
accompanies all three.

Subsequently to writing the above paragraphs, I took the opportunity of re-examining the magnificent
series of gunshot fractures collected during the Franco-German campaign by Sir William MacCormac,
and afterwards presented by him to the museum of St. Thomas's Hospital.

The close approximation in type between the main features in these and those in the fractures
produced by the modern bullet is very striking. In the case of the shafts of the long bones,
the same stellate, oblique, wedge-shaped, and even perforating injuries are illustrated on
a coarser scale. In a specimen of a patella, a perforation of the lower half, implicating also
the tendon of the quadriceps muscle is, though large, almost as pure as a Mauser perforation.

The difference in the nature of the lesions of the bones is seen to be, firstly, one of pure
magnitude, corresponding to the size of the large Snider bullet by which they were produced.
Thus the fragments generally are larger, and occupy a wider area of the shafts, the first character
depending on the lesser degree of velocity of the bullet, the latter on its volume and weight.
Fine comminution, however, the most striking feature of the modern injury, is throughout absent.

The effect of the larger size of the wedge provided by the bullet in increasing the length
of secondary longitudinal fissures is well marked, and for the same reason the perforations
are usually accompanied by fissures of considerable extent. It is interesting to note, however,
that even in the case of the large bullets, and the special tendency shown by them to cause
the extension of fissures into the joints, one or two specimens still show that these fissures
incline to stop short when the point of junction between the portion of the shaft occupied
by the medullary canal and that built on a foundation of cancellous tissue is reached.

LESIONS OF THE SHORT AND FLAT BONES

The above types of fracture are those common to the shafts of the long bones, but the difference
in structure of the articular ends and the short and flat bones endows lesions of these with
somewhat different characters, the nature of which varies between grooving, perforation, and
great comminution.

The most typical injury consists in the production of a clean perforation of the cancellous
bone; this was common both in the articular ends and in the short bones. The tunnel differed
little in character from those already described, a tendency always existing to the lifting
of a lid of compact tissue at the exit end of the track.

For the production of the cleanest forms of injury I believe high rates of velocity were distinctly
favourable, although I am unable to maintain this statement by proof in the case of injuries
received at the shortest ranges of fire. When the velocity was lower, yet with force still
sufficient to produce a perforating injury, the separation of an extensive scale of bone at
the exit aperture was a marked feature not seen in perforations produced by higher degrees
of velocity. Fig. 52, of a perforation of the lower end of the femur, well exhibits this feature;
but it must be borne in mind in this case that the illustration is not a pure one, both shaft
and epiphysis taking part in the walls of the track, and the exit opening is in the former,
where a thicker layer of compact bone exists than would cover any epiphysis, and hence the
fragment is larger. I use the example, however, because it so forcibly illustrates the effect
of increased resistance on the part of the bone struck in widening the area of the lesion.
When the track was entirely limited to the articular ends the small amount of damage at either
aperture was shown by clinical evidence in the rarity of subsequent limitation of joint movements
due to bony deformity.

Again, it was rare for fissuring to extend from these tunnels to the articular surfaces; thus
many instances could be given of perforation of the head of the humerus, the olecranon, or
the femoral condyles, in which no evidence of joint fissure was discoverable. The slight amount
of resistance offered by the cancellous ends was also clinically illustrated by the absence
of severe synovial effusions when they were struck. When the joint cavity was not crossed,
slight effusion only resulted, while in the case of fractures of the femoral shaft great effusion
into the knee-joint, resulting from the forcible vibration transmitted to the limb, was a common
feature, even when the point fractured was situated above the centre of the bone. Again, when
the joint cavity was crossed a moderate degree only of hæmarthrosis was the most common result.

With regard to the implication of joints, either primary or secondary, in connection with fractures
of the articular ends, I am inclined to place the lesions of the upper end of the tibia in
a more important position than those of any other bone. Evidence of this implication was in
my experience more frequent here than in any other situation. This may in part be attributable
to the complexity of structure of this epiphysis, and perhaps more correctly to the influence
of its irregular outline in favouring lateral forms of impact on the part of the bullet and
consequent increase in the area of damage.

Next to tunnelling, grooving was the most common form of injury to the short bones. In the
case of superficial tracks the compact tissue might be considerably comminuted, but not, as
a rule, over a width greatly exceeding the calibre of the bullet.

Comminution and crushing of a single or several bones were rare in proportion to the occurrence
of similar injuries produced by Martini-Henry or large leaden bullets. When the condition was
produced by bullets of small calibre, I believe it was in the majority of cases the result
of irregular impact on the part of the projectile. In support of this view it may be added
that such injuries were most common in the bones of the tarsus, bones especially liable to
be struck by ricochet bullets.

It was generally believed that bullets travelling at a very high degree of velocity were liable
to cause severe comminution of the short bones, but I never saw any cases supporting this opinion;
in point of fact, all the short-range lesions of this nature that I saw were of the clean perforating
variety. I believe that this is capable of satisfactory explanation on the ground of the thin
character of the layer of compact tissue which for the most part ensheaths the short bones;
this decreases the resistance offered to the bullet and so tends to localise the lesion. This
statement may be supported by two observations with regard to the long and flat bones. First,
if the shaft of a long bone be hit above the junction of diaphysis and epiphysis, the cancellous
tissue in and extending from the medullary cavity is pulverised, and examination of fragments
from such fractures gives the impression of the inner aspect having been scraped clean. Secondly,
I saw one fracture of the ilium produced by a bullet taking a course between its compact layers
for 3 inches from the notch between the anterior superior and anterior inferior spines; the
bone to the extent of 2-1/2 square inches was pulverised, the cancellous tissue blown away
as dust, and the compact tissue only represented by scales still adhering by their periosteum
to the muscles attached to the two surfaces of the bone. This injury was produced from a rifle
fired at five yards distance, and was an extreme example; but, on the other hand, it illustrates
only what we are thoroughly well acquainted with in the case of flat bones, such as those of
the cranium, where the compact element is abundant in comparison with the cancellous, and the
resistance offered to the bullet is consequently great.

Some remarks on transverse fractures of the patella will be found under the heading devoted
to that bone.

Lesions of the flat bones are considered at some length in Chapter VII., which deals with injuries
to the head, and their special features are there described; some further remarks on these
injuries will be found under the headings of the individual bones.

Special characters of the symptoms observed, and of the course of healing of the fractures.--Peculiarities
in the initial signs may be rapidly passed over. The first depended on the large number of
lesions of the bone which were unaccompanied by loss of continuity. In the case of perforations
attention to the course of the track, external palpation, and possibly the detection of bone
dust in the aperture of exit, were usually sufficient to indicate injury to the bones. When
these did not suffice the introduction of a probe would usually set the question at rest; but
this is always to be avoided if possible, as adding a fresh item of risk to the wound. The
X rays were not always to hand, and are not always capable of giving reliable information in
the matter of perforations, although very useful in detecting grooves or notching. The latter
injuries are those in which information as to the condition of the bones is often of most interest
in view of the characters of the external wounds.

Fractures with solution of continuity were, as a rule, easy of detection, but the relative
prominence of the classical signs varied somewhat from what we are accustomed to see in civil
practice.

The first striking peculiarity noted in comminuted fractures of the long bones was the degree
of local shock; the limbs were often quite powerless, the muscles flaccid, and common sensation
lowered. This was of importance in two ways; firstly, shortening of the limb was often absent
as a sign, and, secondly, pain was sometimes not at all pronounced even when the patient was
moved. The primary absence of shortening, even persisting for the first two or three days,
was a phenomenon always important to bear in mind, as it affected the degree of extension needed
in the treatment of the fracture, which, if sufficient at the moment, often proved quite inadequate
with the return of tone in the muscles. Secondly, abnormal mobility was usually strongly marked,
and this sometimes without very definite crepitus, as a result of the fine nature of the comminution
and the displacement of the small fragments.

During the course of healing some other peculiarities are worthy of mention. First of all,
union was tardy and often not strong. On the other hand, an abundance of provisional callus
was common, which formed large swellings apt to implicate neighbouring nerves, and sometimes
to interfere with the movements of joints. The slowness of healing was particularly noticeable
in those cases where the degree of local shock had been marked, and was probably to some extent
dependent on disturbance of the general nutrition of the tissues of the affected limb. Beyond
this, however, it was in many cases a direct result of the degree of comminution and displacement
of the fragments, which necessitated the formation of a large amount of provisional callus,
and time for the proper consolidation and contraction of the same. In many cases a large ball-like
mass of callus surrounding the fragments was developed, into which the actual ends of the broken
bone only dipped, and hence union was weak and insecure. As to those cases in which the wounds
closed by primary union, we must bear in mind in this relation the tardy union often observed
in civil practice, when the irritation of suppuration and consequent inflammation are absent.

Another peculiarity of a similar nature was the occasional late necrosis of fragments; the
wounds apparently healed well, only to break down weeks or months later for the discharge of
a sequestrum. Such cases were quite distinct from those in which primary suppuration had occurred.
I saw one or two instances in fractures of the humerus, the trouble arising with commencing
use of the limb, and I suppose that fragments which suffered death at the time of the injury
had been enclosed, and only caused irritation as foreign bodies when the muscles again came
into action. In the absence both of evident necrosis and suppuration, however, in some cases
the exit portion of the track in the soft parts was extremely slow in healing. Although no
discharge beyond a small quantity of blood-tinged serum escaped, the wounds remained open for
many weeks, even when the fracture consolidated well. I ascribed this to slow separation of
aseptic sloughs, a point which has already been mentioned under the heading of wounds in general.

Superabundance of callus, as far as I had an opportunity of judging, comparatively seldom gave
rise to permanent mechanical trouble. This was no doubt due to the infrequency of extension
of the comminuted fractures beyond the junction of diaphysis and epiphysis.

Lastly, with regard to suppuration, only a small proportion of the fractures, accompanied by
the presence of large wounds, escaped infection. When infection did occur, the results offered
some special features dependent on the small relative amount of damage to the soft tissues,
compared with that suffered by the bone. In an ordinary compound fracture, such as we meet
with in civil practice, whether the result of direct or indirect violence, a considerable amount
of contusion or laceration, as the case may be, accompanies the injury to the bone. The result
of this is a widespread effusion of blood into the limb, which tears and strips up the various
layers of soft parts, and opens up the way to the spread of infection, often into the whole
length of the segment of the limb affected. In fractures produced by bullets of small calibre,
even when the exit portion of the track is large, the injury to the soft parts is far more
localised, except in extreme cases, while the bone itself is the tissue which has suffered
the most severe violence and contusion. When infection occurred, its spread corresponded with
this anatomical feature of the lesion, and the bone itself and its immediate neighbourhood
suffered the most severely.

At the present day one is naturally not very familiar with a large series of suppurating compound
fractures, but during my whole experience I have never seen so many cases of what might be
regarded as fairly pure instances of acute osteo-myelitis. The symptoms corresponded with the
main seat of the suppuration; only moderate swelling of the limbs occurred, this mainly consisting
in soft superficial oedema; often there was no redness, and fluctuation was difficult to determine.
At the same time symptoms of constitutional infection, such as continued fever, rapid pulse,
restlessness, loss of strength, progressive anæmia, and emaciation, were marked. Pyæmia, as
evidenced by secondary deposits, was, however, rare; I only saw two cases, both in fractures
of the femur; in both recovery followed secondary amputation.

Prognosis.--This depended almost entirely on the nature of the injury to the soft parts; given
moderate injury to these, and the preservation of the wound from infection, scarcely any degree
of injury of the bones precluded recovery, even if this were slow and prolonged. The existence
of perforations scarcely increased to an important extent the gravity of a wound of the soft
parts alone; in fact, this injury could not be regarded as more severe than an ordinary surgical
osteotomy, putting the risks of infection of the wound under the special circumstances on one side.

With regard to the functional results, these depended on the degree of comminution; when this
was extreme, union was slow and for a time weak, and shortening was often considerable, but
a fair result was as a rule obtained.

Suppuration and osteo-myelitis were the dangerous features when they occurred; still, even
in the presence of these, I never saw a fatal result in an upper extremity fracture, although
in the lower extremity a considerable mortality followed fractures both of the leg and thigh,
the deaths being most commonly from septicæmia, or from a combination of this with secondary
hæmorrhage.

Treatment.--The general treatment was of a simple character. The perforations may be at once
dismissed, since nothing more was needed than what has been already described under the heading
of wounds of the soft parts. Again, with regard to the co-existence of vascular injury, or
injury to the soft parts generally, the ordinary rules guiding us in civil practice were followed.

The first point of importance, and needing consideration in the treatment of severely comminuted
fractures, was as to whether in these it was better simply to try to obtain union of the wound
with as little disturbance as possible, or to anæsthetise the patient and explore the wound,
removing such fragments as were free or widely displaced. I think the answer to this question
depends entirely on the nature of the external wounds. If these be of the small type forms,
or if the exit aperture is, at any rate, of only moderate size, a strictly conservative attitude
is the better when the risk of making an exploration under the circumstances is borne in mind,
the more so as an exploration, to be safe and useful, ought to be done at once. If the exit
wound is of the large or explosive type, on the other hand, there is no doubt that the best
results are to be obtained by early exploration and the removal of all loose fragments. I saw
several excellent results obtained in this way, even when the patients had to undergo the risk
of transport shortly, in some cases the very next day, after the operation. The loose fragments
are an immediate source of danger, and later may interfere with the healing of the fracture,
even if suppuration does not occur. In all the cases that I saw the exit wound was dressed,
but left freely open, and I do not think any attempt to close it should ever be made.

The question of operative fixation rarely needs consideration; it occasionally happens, however,
that oblique fractures, such as one mentioned on p. 166, are met with, in which screwing or
wiring of the bone ends is advisable. What has been said above as to fractures, accompanied
by loss of continuity, applies equally to cases of severe wedge-fracture, where many loose
fragments exist.

As to the disinfection of the limb, primary cleansing, mainly by soap and water, of course
precedes the exploration, and when the latter has been carried out a second cleansing and disinfection,
preferably with spirit and carbolic acid lotion, are imperative.

Immobilisation is a more difficult problem. In practised hands plaster-of-Paris splints answer
most requirements except in the case of the thigh; but the splints take time to apply and also
to set firmly, and, as sometimes needing frequent removal, are not altogether suitable for
Field hospital work. Of all the splints I saw in use, I think the best were wire splints, and
the Dutch cane folding splints for the thigh and leg (figs. 56, 58); wire-gauze splints with
steel at the margins (fig. 54), or strips of ordinary cardboard applied with some variety of
adhesive bandage for the arm and forearm; and plain wooden of various lengths for any situation.

A question of constant difficulty was that of frequency of dressing; in a Stationary or Base
hospital this is not difficult, as the same surgeon has the patient continuously under his
charge, and can readily decide as to the proper moment for the renewal of the dressing. When
the patient is, however, being moved from the Field to the Stationary hospital, and thence
to the Base, a constant succession of surgeons has the case in hand for short periods, the
movements during transport disturb the fixity of the dressing, and, in consequence, dressings
are apt to be far more frequent than is advisable. This question raises the larger one of the
advisability of any transport beyond what may be an actual necessity. There is only one answer
to this. No fractures of the thigh or leg, and few of the arm, can be transported for any distance
without material disadvantage. The risks attendant on disturbance of the fracture and tissue
injury, septic infection as a result of slipping of the dressing and the impracticability of
efficiently renewing it, far more than counterbalance any advantage to be gained from the superior
comforts available at a Base hospital. For these reasons, if possible, all fractures of the
arm, thigh, or leg should be kept at a Stationary hospital for a period of three or more weeks,
and, as far as splints and appliances are concerned, these should be as numerous and complete
as at a Base hospital. I have had a useful set made of aluminium. A word will be added later
as to the splints suitable for different regions of the body.

The necessity for primary amputation chiefly depends on the nature of the injury to the soft
parts, less commonly on the extent of the injury to the bones, and should be decided on exactly
the same lines as in civil practice. So-called intermediate amputations are always to be avoided
if possible; the results were consistently bad, and the operation should only be undertaken
in cases of severe sepsis where little can be hoped from it, or for secondary hæmorrhage. When
the operation could be tided over until the septic process had settled down and localised itself,
secondary amputation gave very fair results. In either intermediate or secondary amputation
for suppurating fractures, it was necessary to bear in mind the special likelihood of the existence
of extensive osteo-myelitis. If this condition affected the upper fragment, an amputation was
of little use unless the whole bone was removed, as septic infection continued and brought
about a fatal issue, or a fresh amputation was required in order to obtain a stump that would heal.

SPECIAL FRACTURES

Upper Extremity.--Fractures of the scapula were not uncommon, but were mostly of the perforative
variety; thus perforations both of the spine in longitudinal wounds of the back, and of the
ala in perforating wounds of the thorax, were tolerably frequent. They possessed little practical
interest; as a rule, the openings were not large, and the most unexpected feature was the small
interference with the movements of the bone on the chest wall that resulted. It might be assumed
that comminuted fragments would project into the muscles and cause both pain and interference
with movement; but neither was the case. I saw grooving of the crest of the spine, but never
happened to meet with a fracture of the acromion process. Many axillary tracks passed in the
closest proximity to the coracoid, but this again I never saw separated. One practical point
of importance with regard to the scapula was the frequency with which bullets lodged in the
venter, or the firmly bound-down muscles of the supra- and infra-spinous fossæ. These retained
bullets often gave rise to remarkably little trouble in this situation; thus I have a skiagram
of a shrapnel bullet lying in the deepest part of the subscapular fossa, which did not inconvenience
its possessor.

Every variety of fracture of the clavicle was met with, even perforation of the most compact
portion of the shaft; comminuted, wedge, or notched fractures were, however, the more common,
and were accompanied by the development of very large masses of provisional callus during the
process of healing. An interesting skiagram is reproduced in plate III., which shows a compound
form of injury to the clavicle. The bullet has passed obliquely beneath the acromial end, rising
to perforate the posterior compact margin, and producing one of the diamond-shaped openings
sometimes occurring in compact bone with the passage of bullets at a low rate of velocity.
No case of perforation of the subclavian vein by comminuted fragments of the clavicle came
under my notice.

Fractures of the humerus of every variety were common, and I think when the statistics of the
campaign are published, it will be shown that the humerus was the most frequently injured individual
bone in the whole body. I remember to have seen thirteen fractures of the shaft of the humerus
in one pavilion alone at Wynberg after the battle of Paardeberg.

Perforations of the upper articular extremity were common, and as a rule gave rise to wonderfully
little trouble in the shoulder-joint. The outer aspect of the head of the humerus is a common
situation for the production of a special form of broken canal or groove (fig. 53). The slope
from the greater tuberosity to the shaft naturally favours the production of the injury in
this position.

I saw only one case in which a vertical fissure extended from a fracture of the shaft into
the shoulder-joint; in this case the transverse solution of continuity was at the upper part
of the middle third of the bone. Skiagram, plate IV., illustrates a well-marked stellate comminution
of the shaft with large fragments. Plate V. shows extreme comminution with fragments blown
out of the wound. Two plates, Nos. VI. and VIII., illustrate well the difference resulting
from the oblique passage of a bullet at high and low rates of velocity respectively. In both
cases good results were obtained; in the more severe the resultant mass of ensheathing callus
was very large, temporarily interfered with flexion of the elbow-joint, and consolidation was
very slow (see plate VII.). The patient was wounded at Belmont in November 1899, but he was
able to row at the end of the summer of 1900, although very prolonged suppuration occurred,
and the elbow movements became practically normal. Plate IX. illustrates a transverse track,
the bullet having undergone considerable injury during its passage through the bone, as evidenced
by the presence of fragments both of mantle and lead in the limb. This might be called an example
of transverse fracture, and illustrates the nearest approach to one seen when the bone is struck
fairly plumb.

Plate VIII. exhibits an oblique fracture of the lower part of the shaft produced by a bullet
passing at a low rate of velocity. It does not widely differ from a perforation, and the illustration
possesses some further interest as showing the deviation of a bullet likely to occur when a
bone lies in its course. Although the velocity with which this bullet was travelling must have
been very low, when the bone had been traversed the deviation in its course was slight. A few
bony fragments from the compact tissue of the posterior surface of the humerus have been carried
into the distal portion of the track.

Fractures of the various prominences of the lower articular extremity were not uncommon, but
deviated little from the types with which we are familiar in civil practice; the after results
were good, both as to union and movement of the elbow.

Explosive wounds of the soft parts were not infrequent in the arm, and fig. 48, p. 158, exhibits
an extreme example. The humerus in respect of depth of covering, however, comes between the
femur and the bones of the leg and forearm; hence such injuries were not so easily produced
as in the latter segments of the limbs.

In connection with the subject of fractures of this bone, one word must be added as to the
occurrence of the most characteristic of its complications, musculo-spiral paralysis. This
was frequent in every position of the fracture, and came on either immediately, or, at a subsequent
period, as a result of callus irritation or pressure. Its frequency is only what would be expected
when the nature of the fracture is considered, but the chief interest of the condition lay
in the difficulty of certainly detecting it in the initial stages of the cases; this depended
on the fact that in many of them the local shock to the limb was so severe that the function
of the whole of the muscles was lowered, or in some cases, although the musculo-spiral was
the nerve chiefly affected, the other large trunks had also suffered concussion or contusion.
In consequence of this difficulty the actual localised paralysis often only became evident
at the end of a week, or even more, when there was difficulty in deciding as to whether the
paralysis was primary or due to secondary trouble. In the fracture illustrated by skiagram,
plate IV., the nerve suffered complete division, and was united some three months later, improvement
in the symptoms being very slow. The latter was a common experience, and although not unusual
in civil practice, I think it is more marked in these injuries as a result of the more widespread
character of the nerve lesion.

The bones of the forearm were also often fractured. The principal peculiarity of these fractures
was the common localisation of the injury to one bone, which is readily seen to be probable.

Each bone offered some special features dependent on its structural character and anatomical
position. In the case of the ulna, pure perforation of the olecranon process, without obvious
evidence of implication of the elbow, was seen on several occasions. The other important feature
with regard to this bone depends on its subcutaneous position, which accounted for the frequency
with which highly developed explosive exit wounds were met with. One is figured in the general
section (fig. 47, p. 156). This, however, is a very slight instance compared with what was
often seen in the upper and middle thirds of the bone, where the lateral soft parts often protruded
as a much larger tumour, the particular illustration being mainly designed to show the nature
of the injury to the skin. The radius, as more deeply placed in the upper part of its course,
was less often the seat of such well-marked explosive injuries; but when the lower end was
struck this character was sometimes very striking: thus in a track passing antero-posteriorly
through this bone, the whole lower end appeared shattered, all the tendons at the back of the
wrist being implicated in the protruding mass, while the bone itself seemed shortened, so that
the hand took up the position common in Colles's fracture. It was found impossible to place
the bone in good position; nevertheless the patient retained his hand, which is still of use
in writing.

Plate X. is a good example of a high-velocity injury in which lateral contact with the radius
has produced local comminution, some slight injury to the casing of the bullet, and the separation
of a large wedge. The case from which this was taken also illustrated well one of the chief
troubles of such fractures of the forearm; the degree of splintering resulted in the formation
of a large mass of callus, which for a time rendered any degree of pronation and supination
impossible.

Of fractures of the hand I have little to say. In the case of the carpus, the slight degree
of resistance offered by the bones rendered injuries of an explosive character rare. I never
saw one. Fractures of the metacarpus, on the other hand, presented exactly the opposite features.
The density of these small bones was well illustrated by the frequency with which the bullet
suffered injury, even amounting to fragmentation, and the great comminution they themselves
suffered. The breaking up of the bullet in these fractures was a curious feature, which may
perhaps be explained by the tendency of the distal part of the limb to be driven in the course
of the bullet, with the result of somewhat lengthening the period of contact of the projectile,
or more probably by somewhat frequently occurring irregular impact. Plate XI. is a good example
of an injury of this nature of moderate severity. The soft parts suffered much in these injuries,
the tendons were torn and lacerated at the moment, and were very apt to acquire more or less
permanent adhesion. This latter condition was sometimes to be improved by the removal of bone
fragments, and I have freed tendons from actual clefts in the bones where they had been carried
in by the bullet. In some cases very great deformity of the digits, due to shortening, developed,
even when no fragments were removed beyond those blown away by the bullet.

One form of injury of some interest was multiple fracture of the phalanges produced by a bullet
travelling in a course parallel to the length of the rifle when pointed by the patient. Occasionally
several digits were lost.

Treatment of fractures of the upper extremity.--The general lines of this have already been
foreshadowed in the general section, the remarks as to transport being applicable to all serious
fractures of the shaft of the humerus, and this is the only one of the bones of the upper extremity
on which anything special need be said, as the treatment of all the other fractures exactly
coincides with that of ordinary civil practice.

The treatment of wounds should be on the lines already laid down: thorough cleansing, and then
an attempt to seal. In severely comminuted fractures, however, the exit wound may be of very
large size, and then frequent dressings are necessary. Loose fragments, by which those freed
from their periosteal connections are meant, need removal. The question which most interested
me was the best method of fixation. This needs to be sufficient to effect immobility, but on
the other hand in many cases the weight of the arm as a means of extension is very valuable.
Some of the most successfully treated cases that I saw were fixed by means of simple strips
of pasteboard, applied moist, and fixed with an adhesive bandage. Ordinary book-muslin bandages
are as good as anything for this purpose, as they can be reinforced by a stronger form outside
them. Where necessary, an angular piece of cardboard can be applied on the inner aspect, or
a wooden angular splint may be substituted, if it is at hand; but in this case most of the
advantage of the weight of the arm as a means of extension is lost. The cardboard cases possess
the great advantage of being readily cut off and reapplied much as is done with plaster of
Paris. During the period in which dressing may be necessary I believe this form of splint is
as good as can be got for use in Field hospitals, the only point needing care being to ensure
that the bandaging is not too tight. It is much more reliable than are ordinary splints if
transport is unavoidable, and is much lighter and less irksome to the patient. With such strips
of cardboard, a few of the gauze splints (fig. 54), and a few angular and wooden splints, I
believe a Field hospital is fully equipped for the treatment of any fractures of the upper
extremity.

Fractures of the pelvis.--These, as a rule, were of so slight a nature as to form a very insignificant
part of the entire injury with which they were associated, or when uncomplicated they were
of little more importance than simple wounds of the soft parts. The very great majority were
of the simple perforating type. I had the opportunity of examining three at the brim of the
pelvis, these all passing in a downward direction. The openings were of about the same calibre
as the bullet, and at their entrance was a small amount of bone dust such as would be found
at the entry hole of a gimlet. It was these that made me consider the possibility of the rifle
grooves having some part in the ease with which certain perforations are made. Of a large number
of cases in which bullets traversed the ilium, the openings in the bone, as a rule, were with
difficulty palpated. I must say that I was astonished that I never met with an instance of
an extensive stellate fracture in the case of the ilium. Such may have occurred in some of
the cases fatal on the field or shortly afterwards, but I never came across one in the hospital.
It says much for the combined density and toughness of the human pelvis.

Comminuted fractures were, however, occasionally met with when the bullet passed in a track
parallel to the plane of the bone. One such of an unusual character has already been mentioned
on p. 171. A still more interesting form, and one highly characteristic of flat bone injuries,
is shown in fig. 55. The patient, a man wounded at Modder River, was struck at a range of 300
to 400 yards. The bullet entered over about the centre of the ilium and emerged in the anterior
abdominal wall about 2 inches above the anterior-superior spine. As there was some doubt as
to penetration of the abdomen, and as the exit wound was of considerable size, the wound was
explored, an anæsthetic having been given. A clean-cut track in the bone was discovered which
allowed the middle finger to be placed in it. There was little splintering of either inner
or outer table of the bone beyond the width of the track, but plates of each table adhered
on the one side to the origin of the gluteus medius, and on the other to the iliacus, the latter
muscle being somewhat widely separated from the venter ilii by effused blood. There was no
perforation of the abdominal cavity.

Lesser degrees of the same kind of injury amounting to grooving of the surface or notching
of the crest of the ilium were not uncommon, and the occasional large character of exit openings
in buttock wounds pointed to contact of travelling bullets with other parts of the external
pelvic wall.

Certain portions of the pelvis were subject to more severe comminution; thus in one case in
which the bladder was wounded, a very much comminuted fracture of the horizontal ramus of the
pubes was produced by a bullet which subsequently lodged in the thigh behind the femoral vessels.
In this case the track was so oblique as to have necessitated almost pure lateral impact on
the part of the bullet; hence the form of injury was nearly allied to the comminutions of the
ilium already described.

I never observed a fracture of the floor of the acetabulum by a bullet which had entered from
the back of the pelvis, although tracks entering by the great sciatic notch were not infrequent.
I saw one case in which a bullet which traversed the upper part of the shoulder and emerged
at the axilla entered a second time an inch behind and above the anterior superior spine, and
split off a layer of the outer table of the ilium of the extent of two square inches, which
involved the upper portion of the rim of the acetabulum. No displacement upwards of the femur
resulted; but external rotation was accompanied by crepitus. The wound suppurated, and some
general infection resulted, but six weeks later there was no evidence of fluid in the hip-joint,
the limb was adducted and slightly rotated outwards, and some movement in each direction could
be made without causing any great amount of pain. I can say nothing of the further course of
this case, as I neglected to take the patient's name.

I saw one or two instances of perforation of the sacrum. One is mentioned in the chapter on
injuries to the abdomen, in which a central puncture at the level of the fourth vertebra was
accompanied by temporary incontinence of fæces.

Fractures of the femur were fairly numerous and formed one of the most serious classes of case
we had to treat, as well as one of the most fertile sources of mortality in the Base hospitals.
In spite of the last observation, however, it is probable that the results in this campaign
will be far better than in any previous war, both as to the smaller proportion in which amputation
was needed and as to recovery.

In spite of a considerable experience, I never saw a case of perforation of either the head
or neck of the thigh bone. I saw numerous tracks emerging at the side of the femoral vessels
and entering at the buttock or vice versa, but never one accompanied either by effusion into
the hip-joint or impairment of movement. Considering the regularity with which hæmarthrosis
occurred when the other joints were crossed, and also the nature of the compact tissue of the
neck of the femur, which must have ensured some splintering, I do not think I can have overlooked
an injury of this nature. No doubt also the escape of the neck of the bone was explained in
some of the cases by the fact that the injuries were received while the hip-joint was in a
position of flexion, the bullet passing over the neck of the femur. In two cases of extensive
comminution of the upper third of the femur that I saw, the fissures stopped short at the inter-trochanteric
line anteriorly, but in one of them a large angular fragment was torn out of the posterior
surface of the neck.

Excepting transverse fracture every form was met with in the shaft, although I saw only two
instances of perforation. One has been already alluded to and was situated in the broadening
portion of the lower third, the bullet taking an antero-posterior course. The second is seen
in plate XVII.

Plate XII. shows an instance of extreme comminution of the upper third accompanied by the presence
of two typical elongated fragments. The course taken by the bullet was almost directly antero-posterior,
and the wounds were of moderate size even in the case of the exit one. This seems to preclude
the possibility of the injury having been produced by a ricochet bullet, while the fact of
perforation and escape of the bullet in spite of the serious damage suffered by the mantle
points to the injury having been produced at a short range of fire. The patient himself owns
to being quite unable to give any estimate of the distance. Although no suppuration occurred,
this fracture was very slow in consolidating, and the free comminution with consequent inaccurate
apposition led to the development of four inches shortening of the limb. The skiagram was taken
about six weeks after the occurrence of the injury, a few days after I first saw the patient;
I have, however, had the opportunity of seeing a second skiagram taken some four months later.
This is of considerable interest, as throwing light on the mode of union of such fractures.
The two elongated fragments in the later skiagram are widened to three times their original
breadth, and form buttresses on either side of the point of union, while the irregular ends
of the shaft are rounded off, and the mass of fine fragments behind is consolidated. Beyond
this the second skiagram shows that the upper fragment, apparently intact in the first, was
really split longitudinally, and therefore was far less useful as a point of support than might
have been assumed from the earlier skiagram, plate XIII. The case illustrates well the chief
difficulty in the treatment of such fractures: that of maintaining the fragments in line, since
absolutely no help is received from the apposition of the two ends, and artificial traction
alone must be relied upon.

Plate XIV. offers a good contrast; the fracture here presents a typical stellate form, and
a good result without shortening was readily obtained. I assume that the difference in character
of these two fractures depended mainly on the rate of velocity with which the bullet was travelling,
since it passed fairly directly across the limb in each. I think it is clear, however, that
the bullet struck the femur rather nearer the centre of the width of the shaft and therefore
more directly, in the more severe injury.

This brings me to the question of explosive exit wounds in the thigh. In spite of the great
tendency to comminution of the shaft, these were rare in a severe form. This depended simply
on the depth and thickness of the coverings of the bone, and, as already mentioned, although
the skin openings were often comparatively small, a large cavity or area of destroyed soft
tissues may be contained within the limb. I do not think I ever saw an exit wound in the thigh
exceeding 1-1/2 inch in diameter.

The oblique fracture illustrated by plate XVI. has been already referred to, and the influence
of the weight and movement of the trunk on its production has been considered.

Plate XV. illustrates an obliquely comminuted fracture of another character. The bullet has
here been stripped of its mantle, which has undergone fragmentation, but the leaden core is
little altered in shape. This is of much interest, since it shows that the bullet struck the
bone by its side. The effect of such lateral impact on the part of the projectile is well shown:
there is great bone comminution of a less regular character than usual, and the bullet is retained.
Retention in this case was probably not a result of low velocity of flight, but of the increased
resistance offered by the broad area of bone struck, and the check exerted on the axial rotation
of the bullet by the lateral contact.

Slighter injuries to the femur in which the shaft was chipped or grooved without loss of continuity
were not uncommon, and showed well the capacity of the bone to withstand the lateral shock
transmitted by small bullets. Two figures inserted in the chapter on wounds in general (figs.
22, 23, pp. 61, 62) are of cases in which, from the appearance of the wound of exit, the bullet
probably underwent deformation, or was so deflected as to escape on a considerably altered
axis. Beyond the nature of the exit wound in the case depicted in fig. 22, some thickening
beneath the femoral vessels denoted bone injury, but unfortunately no skiagram was taken.

I saw no case in which a transverse fracture of the shaft accompanied such injuries, but am
under the impression that, if they had been produced by bullets of greater volume and weight,
transverse solution of continuity would have been more common. In point of fact, no case of
pure transverse fracture of the femur ever came under my notice.

The diagram depicted in fig. 51, p. 164, is from a sketch made of the lower end of a femur
in which a severely comminuted fracture followed by suppuration necessitated an amputation
of the thigh, performed by Major Lougheed, R.A.M.C. It is inserted as an illustration of the
tendency of the fissures to stop short above the actual articular extremities of the bones.
In this case the comminution was extreme and accompanied by the usual long lateral fragments,
one of which measured five inches in length and might well have extended into the knee-joint
had that been an ordinary occurrence.

Perforations of the lower extremity of the bone were very common. These were sometimes transverse
and limited to the articular extremity itself, or the same limitation occurred to the antero-posterior
tracks. These were the slightest forms of injury, putting on one side incomplete tunnels and
grooves on the surface of the bone. With regard to the latter, however, when they invaded the
joint cavity the injury was liable to be more severe than a complete perforation, in consequence
of the projection of comminuted fragments into the joint cavity near the line of reflection
of the synovial capsule and ulterior interference with freedom of movement.

Other tracks took a direction of longitudinal obliquity, and then implicated both epiphysis
and diaphysis. Fig. 52, p. 169, shows an example, and also the peculiarity likely to be assumed
by the exit aperture in the bone, especially if the bullet was travelling at a low rate of
velocity, a considerable plate of the compact bone being driven out. In some cases these oblique
tracks involved both femur and tibia. They will be referred to again under the heading of injuries
to the joints, and some remarks will also be found there regarding the synovial effusion so
often occurring into the knee-joint in cases of fracture of the shaft of the bone.

It may be of interest to insert here a few remarks as to the clinical characteristics of fractures
of the femur. First with regard to the primary signs and symptoms. A very considerable degree
of general or constitutional shock usually accompanied them, and this was perhaps more constant
than in the case of any other injury in the body. This was, moreover, no doubt increased by
the unfavourable conditions in which patients on the field of battle are situated in regard
to transport. When the patients were brought into hospital some delay in the primary treatment
was often necessary until reaction took place. Local shock to the part was also a prominent
feature. Abnormal mobility was very free in the badly comminuted cases. Crepitus was often
loose, and of 'the bag of bone' variety. The result of local shock and consequent flaccidity
of the muscles was to reduce the development of primary shortening; in some cases of severe
comminution this was practically nil during the first day or two, when, with return of tone
in the muscles, it sometimes became very considerable. Swelling of the limb was often very
great, and vascular injury definitely far more common than in the fractures of civil practice,
in consequence, no doubt, not only of the number and sharpness of the fragments, but also of
the force with which they were driven into the surrounding tissues. The exit segment of the
track was out of all proportion in size to the entry, as a result of the propulsion of bone
fragments through it. This often made the closure of the exit wound a very protracted event,
the track continuing to discharge a small quantity of bloody serum and fragments of necrosed
tissue for many weeks.

In a large proportion of the cases which were transported for any distance suppuration occurred;
this must have been the case in at least 60 per cent. of the fractures. Suppuration was of
the character already described in the general section, affecting particularly the bone itself,
and accompanied by very marked signs of general infection.

Prognosis in fractures of the femur.--As regards mortality fractures in the upper third of
the bone proved one of the most formidable injuries which came under treatment. Suppuration
was common, at least 60 per cent. of the wounds becoming infected. This depended on several
reasons, often inseparable from the injuries, or from their treatment in Field hospitals: such
as (1) the exit wound being situated in the dangerous region of the thigh; (2) ineffective
dressing and fixation; (3) the impossibility of ensuring primary cleansing and removal of detached
fragments of bone; (4) the necessity of the early transport of patients to the Stationary or
Base hospitals, often for great distances; (5) the comparatively long period that often had
to elapse before the opportunity of doing the first efficient dressing arrived.

Fractures in the middle and lower thirds of the bone were more easy to treat successfully,
but these also added to the list both of amputations and fatalities.

Punctured fractures of the lower articular extremity were usually of little importance, as
they progressed without exception, as far as my experience went, favourably.

I can give no idea of the general results obtained during the whole campaign, but I am able
to state the results of the fractures of the shaft treated at No. 1 General Hospital during
my stay in South Africa. Thirty-two cases of fracture of the shaft of the bone came under treatment,
and of these 6 or 18.7 per cent. needed amputation, and of the whole number 5 or 15.6 per cent.
died. To emphasise the satisfactory nature of these figures I need only quote the results attained
in the American War of the Rebellion; mortality in upper third, 46 per cent.; middle third,
40.6 per cent.; lower third, 38.2 per cent.

I need hardly dwell upon the difference between the nature of the injuries received in the
American War of the Rebellion and in the present campaign, as in the former the old large bullets
were employed, and shell injuries are possibly included; but I ought to add in this relation,
that the numbers quoted from No. 1 General Hospital included, to my knowledge, at least three
severe Martini-Henry wounds.

The first element for a favourable prognosis is a small wound, and opportunity for an efficient
primary treatment of the same; the second the absence of necessity for transport of the patient.
With regard to the second of these requirements, we were unfortunately situated in South Africa,
and the majority of the cases which did badly were moved during the first few days and for
a distance of between five and six hundred miles. On the other hand, as a rule, the external
wounds were small.

As to functional result, the fractures did well. I think an average of an inch and a half would
well cover the shortening, and in many the length was little altered. Considering the serious
nature of many of these fractures, this was good.

Treatment.--In all punctured fractures of the lower extremity, dressing of the wounds like
uncomplicated ones and a short period of immobilisation were all that was necessary. In oblique
fractures, and those with slight comminution, closure of the wound by dressings, after it had
been carefully cleansed, was all that was necessary prior to applying the splints for immobilisation.

In the highly comminuted fractures a more radical treatment was indicated, especially if the
exit wound was large. In these, after careful preliminary cleansing of the limb, the wounds,
especially the exit aperture, needed exploration and, if necessary, enlargement, and all free
splinters needed removal. If interference with the entry wound could be avoided, this was always
preferable, as it was rare for this not to heal by primary union unless free suppuration occurred.
Under Field hospital conditions I think the exit wound should never be sutured, whatever its
situation; and in the present campaign, where carbolic acid lotion was freely used, this step
was manifestly inadvisable, in view of the abundant serous discharge always to be expected
when this disinfectant has been employed. Except in cases manifestly infected at the time of
exploration, the use of drainage tubes or plugs is not to be recommended. I would point out
also that in the majority of cases it is quite hopeless to attempt to make the entry wound
the safety-valve for drainage, as its natural tendency, even if enlarged, is to heal, while
the condition of the tissues in the exit segment of the track usually renders primary union
an impossibility.

The wound having been dealt with, the next indications were for the reduction of deformity,
immobilisation of the limb, and the provision of a proper degree of extension. As to the reduction
of the fracture, this was always a matter of ease, needing only slight axis traction. The provision
of efficient means of extension and immobilisation was a very different matter. These questions
had to be considered under two sets of conditions: (1) when it was possible to keep the patient
at rest in the hospital he was first deposited in; (2) when it was necessary for him to be
transported for a considerable distance, probably not less than 500 miles.

When transport is a necessity, the best method of immobilisation is the application of breeches
of plaster of Paris, and a long outside splint. The latter we often had excellently made on
emergency by the Ordnance Department or the Royal Engineers. A perineal band is the only form
of extension possible under these circumstances. The Dutch ambulances were provided with a
very excellent emergency splint for cases of fractured thigh, which is illustrated in fig.
56. I think something of this kind should be carried in one of the ambulances going on to every
field of battle, as being far more suitable than a long outside splint for hasty and inaccurate
application. This splint, fixed with some kind of firm bandage, is an excellent temporary one
for use during transport.

In cases which can be treated at a Stationary hospital near at hand, a long outside splint
supplemented by plaster breeches, and a well-applied American extension, is a very good method
of treatment, the only point to bear in mind being frequent examination of the position of
the limb to ensure the extension being efficient. As already mentioned, the shortening in the
primary stages is often slight and easily combated, but in many of these cases if examined
in a few days the limbs are found to have shortened considerably, principally as a result of
recovery of tone by the muscles, and the absence of any help from the resting of the two fragments
end to end. The weight, therefore, has often to be progressively increased and the fracture
readjusted if necessary. Although this method of treatment is satisfactory in cases with a
small wound, it is very troublesome to carry out, even when a bracket is inserted opposite
the wound, when frequent dressing is necessary, as is generally at first the case when the
wounds are large. For this purpose a much more satisfactory method is the use of Hodgen's splint.
This allows of automatic adjustment of the degree of extension, and the dressing of the wound
without interference with the position of the fracture. A continuous many-tailed bag is preferable
to the strips usually employed for the suspension of the limb, as more easily adjustable and
as offering a more even support to the limb.

While at Orange River, in conjunction with Major Knaggs, R.A.M.C., and Mr. Langmore, we treated
several cases of fracture of the shaft of the femur by this method. The splints were made for
us by the Ordnance Department, while the Royal Engineers erected a kind of gallows for us down
the centre of a commissariat marquee in order to avoid the risk of using the tent poles for
suspension. The patients were then ranged on each side of the tent in two rows so that the
pull of the two sets of limbs opposed each other on the gallows from which they were suspended.
Although these patients had to lie on the ground, they were really comfortable compared with
those treated with long outside splints, and the results obtained were very good: in three
cases which I had the opportunity of measuring later the bones were in good position and the
shortening was less than one inch.

I have no doubt whatever that Hodgen's splint is by far the best method of treating all cases
of fractured thigh in the Stationary field hospitals; and, more than this, I believe it is
the only practicable and efficient one. It can be applied without the use of an anæsthetic
without causing undue suffering to the patient, it allows of ready change of the dressing,
it is comfortable and permits considerable range of movement on the part of the patient, it
is as efficient with patients lying on the ground as in a bed, it keeps the limb in good position
and allows of constant inspection on this point, and it is the only method which provides satisfactory
extension without constant readjustment.

Cases in which operative fixation is indicated are rare, but a few oblique fractures may be
treated with advantage in this manner if the conditions surrounding the patient admit of it.
Screwing is generally preferable to wiring.

Lastly, we come to the cases in which primary amputation is necessary. I may say at once that
I saw no case of wound from a bullet of small calibre in which this was indicated, and only
one shell injury in which it was performed. I believe with small bullets that injury to the
main blood-vessels is almost the only indication which is likely to be met with, and this by
no means always indicates an amputation. First of all the question arises as to whether the
wound in the vessel is caused by a bone fragment or by the bullet itself; reference to the
chapter on blood-vessels would seem to prove that a bullet wound is by no means a necessary
indication for amputation. Given favourable conditions, it might be treated locally by ligature
at the time, while if hæmorrhage is not proceeding, developments should be awaited before proceeding
to amputation. In the case of bone fragment punctures, secondary hæmorrhage is a more likely
indication for amputation than primary.

Broadly, it may be laid down that very extensive injury to the soft parts is the only indication
for primary amputation beyond primary hæmorrhage, and it may be added that the condition is
rare with wounds from small-calibre bullets. If a primary amputation is necessary the observations
as to the transport of fractured thighs are equally applicable. I never saw a primary amputation
do well that was moved during the first week; sloughing of flaps or hæmorrhage followed as
a rule, and often death.

Intermediate amputations were indicated in cases of septic infection and those of hæmorrhage;
they seldom did well, and should be avoided if possible. Secondary amputations for sepsis or
hæmorrhage were attended by fair results, but I can give no statistics. Unless extensive osteo-myelitis
is evident, or very widespread cellulitis of the limb exists, I am strongly of opinion that
the amputations when the fractures are above the middle of the thigh should be through the
fracture, and not at the hip-joint, even if a subsequent secondary operation is risked.

Fractures of the patella.--Punctured fractures of the patella were common with direct impact
of the bullet; these were often difficult to palpate, and were only to be certainly diagnosed
by attention to the direction of the track, and the development of hæmarthrosis. I saw at least
three or four in which the bullet, in addition to traversing the knee-joint, injured the popliteal
vessels. I have notes of one case in which a bullet traversed the soft parts from above downwards
and scored a vertical groove on the surface of the patella; this was readily palpable, but
produced no solution of continuity. In several cases the margin of the patella was notched
by a passing bullet.

I never saw a case of stellate fracture, and by this my experience in the case of the ilium
was confirmed.

On two occasions I saw pure transverse fractures of the bone; in each the wound was produced
by a Lee-Metford bullet. This is of some interest as denoting that the greater volume and weight,
in conjunction with the blunter tip, of the Lee-Metford may produce more severe injury to the
bones than the Mauser. I believe this to be the case, given an equal degree of velocity on
the part of the bullet at the moment of impact; but it is probable that the position of the
patella with regard to the condyles of the femur when struck is of far greater importance in
relation to the production of transverse fractures. The skiagram represented in plate XVIII.
shows an obliquely transverse fracture, which in this instance resulted from a crossing bullet,
which grooved the surface of the bone.

With regard to the two cases of transverse fracture above referred to, I may add that one occurred
in a youth under twenty, and a good result was obtained by treatment with splints, and later
by massage. In the second the patient was a man over fifty, who had received other injuries.
The wound over the patella healed and some union had occurred, when the patient fell and burst
both the bone union and the skin cicatrix. Secondary suppuration of the knee-joint, necessitating
an amputation of the thigh, followed, but the patient made a good recovery. The third case
also did well.

The treatment of these injuries differed in no way from that adopted in civil practice, given
satisfactory surroundings. Suture might be indicated in some cases of transverse fracture,
but this would only be necessary if the fragments were widely separated. The punctured fractures
needed treatment as for simple wounds, combined with a short period of rest and pressure for
the condition of hæmarthrosis. It was important not to prolong the period of rest beyond a
week or ten days if the effusion was slight, in view of possible ulterior interference with
range of movement in the knee-joint.

Fractures of the tibia.--Some remarks have already been made regarding fractures of the head
of the tibia, and the importance of the overhanging prominent margins in the production of
somewhat irregular injuries (p. 170). Putting these peculiarities on one side, the cancellous
ends are subject to the type forms of injury; thus perforations either of the head of the bone
or the malleolus were common injuries. The fractures of the shaft also deviated from the type
in so far as the broad flat surfaces in the upper two thirds of the bone rendered it especially
liable to the results of lateral impact, and to the production of the extreme wedge-shaped
types of fracture. Plate XXII. illustrates the different result of a bullet striking the dense
and strong spine at a low rate of velocity, a notch only resulting. If, on the other hand,
the lateral surfaces were struck, a wedge with the base corresponding to the posterior surface
was the most common injury, the spine in many cases remaining intact and maintaining the continuity
of the bone. Wedge-shaped fractures of this bone were apt to show multiple secondary wave fissures
concentric with the main line, and consequently free comminution. I saw several examples, the
loose fragments being remarkably numerous. Plate XIX. is an example of an oblique fracture
produced by a bullet which has ploughed across the bone, displacing large fragments anteriorly,
but finely comminuting the bone in its course, and leaving small fragments of the mantle on
its way. Plate XX. is an example of the rare condition of transverse fracture.

This fracture was produced by a bullet travelling at a high rate of velocity, which struck
the posterior surface of the tibia, and caused a grooving, accompanied by a horizontal fissure
through the whole thickness of the bone; later it struck the fibula more directly, and produced
an ordinary comminuted fracture two inches above the malleolus. Perforations of the shaft were
far more common than in the case of the femur, and I saw them in every part of the length of
the bone (plate XXI.). Fig. 57 illustrates a form of peculiar interest as showing the gradual
transition of the tunnel to the groove, and also as bringing fractures of the long bones into
line with such fractures of the flat bones of the skull as are depicted in fig. 68.

Fractures of the fibula offered no special features of importance. Any form might occur. The
plate No. XXIII. is of interest as showing a spurious form of perforation, and also the primary
form of displacement of the fragments in stellate fractures. It was produced by a reversed
ricochet, but undeformed, bullet, still seen in position in the skiagram; the bullet only possessed
sufficient force to perforate the bone, and then appears to have turned on its transverse axis.
The following plate, No. XXIV., is inserted to show the depth at which the bullet lay, and
its distance from the surface of the tibia, which appears in the first plate to be nil. It
is also of interest as showing the ease with which a false impression may be obtained from
a single picture, as, beyond a spot of transparency, no obvious injury to the fibula, and certainly
no displacement, is discernible.

Fractures of the bones of the leg possessed an unenviable degree of importance. First, on account
of the very severe injuries to the soft parts that often accompanied them, without an apparently
correspondingly serious damage to the bone. Secondly, on account of the frequency with which
the vessels were implicated in these injuries to the soft parts, either by the bullet or bone
fragments. Beyond this, fracture of either articular end of the tibia was certainly more frequently
followed by troublesome joint complications than occurred in the case of any other bone.

In the matter of 'explosive' injuries, I think more were seen in the calf of the leg than in
any other part of the body, and this often without solution of continuity of the bones, and
sometimes without evidence even of contact of the bullet with either tibia or fibula. Some
remarks on this subject have already been made in the chapter on wounds in general, and some
sources of fallacy exposed. I believe that in practically all these so-called explosive injuries
the wound was either caused by a ricochet, or a bullet which deformed with great ease on bony
contact during its progress through the limb. A considerable number of the wounds which were
referred by the men to the use of expanding bullets were probably the result of the use of
Martini-Henry or large leaden sporting bullets, and evidence of this was often forthcoming
on examination of the entry wounds. In other cases the irregularity of the opening plainly
pointed to ricochet of a small bullet as the explanation of the character of the injury. The
greater frequency of ricochet injuries in the leg and foot when the men were standing is readily
understood.

Concurrent injury to the vessels of the leg was common, but primary hæmorrhage, as was the
case generally, usually ceased spontaneously. The importance of injury to the vessels was rather
in view of secondary hæmorrhage, which occurred with some frequency, and I think more commonly
from the anterior than the posterior tibial vessels, usually occurring at the end of a week
or ten days, and naturally most frequently in cases which suppurated.

Prognosis and treatment in fractures of the leg.--In fractures of the leg, except those of
extreme severity, almost any form of splint sufficed to maintain the bones in position, but
for field purposes the Dutch cane splint (fig. 58, p. 222) was certainly very convenient. For
later use in cases that needed frequent dressing, a wooden back splint, with a foot-piece,
or, if obtainable, a Neville's splint with a suspension cradle, was the best. Where the wounds
were small and frequent dressing was not required, nothing was so good as plaster of Paris,
especially when transport was a necessity.

In cases with large wounds suppuration was very frequent, and in connection with this secondary
hæmorrhage, or in the case of fractures near the articular ends, especially the upper, joint
suppuration. The treatment of these cases varied: in many an amputation was the best or only
treatment advisable; but I several times saw good results follow ligation of the anterior tibial
artery for secondary hæmorrhage, even when suppuration existed, and occasional good results
after incision and drainage of joints if the infection was not of the most acute form.

Primary amputation was rarely needed for any case of injury from a bullet of small calibre,
since it was only necessary either in the case of injury to both main arteries, and this was
rare, or in cases of very extensive injury to the soft parts. I saw many of the latter make
fair results when treated conservatively, even though the condition seemed almost hopeless
at first sight. All the primary amputations that I saw were either for shell or large bullet
injuries. A word may be inserted here as to the weight that ought to attach to nerve injuries
in this relation. From the experience gained elsewhere it is clear that we should attach little
importance to these unless the divided nerves are actually in sight, as far as deciding on
amputation is concerned. On the other hand, there is little doubt that the presence of concurrent
nerve injury, be it only concussion or contusion, exerts an important ulterior influence on
the healing of the wound, whether the part be amputated or not. Amputation flaps in such cases
possess a very considerably lowered degree of vitality.

Secondary amputations were often needed for sepsis, and on the whole did very well; both for
the same cause and for hæmorrhage intermediate amputations had occasionally to be performed;
the results of these, as elsewhere, were bad.

Fractures of the tarsus.--Wounds of these short bones were as a rule of slight importance,
given fairly direct impact on the part of the bullet. They then consisted of either simple
perforations or surface grooving. A single bone might be implicated or several might be tunnelled;
in the latter case the implication of the joints very considerably influenced the prognosis,
since the addition of the joint injury caused much more prolonged weakening of the foot.

Wounds of the foot were common from the fact that when the men lay out in the prone position,
the foot was often the part least protected by the cover chosen, and particularly the heel.
In these circumstances the os calcis was the bone most frequently implicated, and that by tracks
taking an oblique course downwards from the leg to the sole. Again the foot was often struck
by ricochet bullets, as a result of its position when the erect attitude was assumed. The latter
fact was of much importance with regard to the nature of the injury sustained by the bones,
as under these circumstances the mode of impact was irregular, and consequently comminution
was often produced.

The behaviour of the different bones of the tarsus varied somewhat. On the whole the prognosis
in cases of injury to the os calcis was the best, since the injury was more often individual
and did not implicate any joint, and also because of the comparatively regular architecture
of the bone. In the smaller bones concurrent injury to a joint was more frequent. In the astragalus
the central hard core extending upwards from the interosseous groove, as increasing resistance,
I think accounted for the fact that comminution was more marked in this bone than in any other.
The effect of wound of bones of the tarsus in producing a certain degree of laxity in the mediotarsal
joint resulting in a slightly flexed position of the fore part of the foot and some projection
of the head of the astragalus did not seem to me easy of explanation, but it occurred with
some regularity.

The injuries to the metatarsus corresponded so nearly to those already spoken of in the case
of the metacarpus that they need no further mention. They were less common, however, and I
am under the impression that fragmentation of the bullet was not such a marked feature, probably
on account of the lower degree of density of the bones, and their greater fixity of position.

CHAPTER VI

INJURIES TO THE JOINTS

Until recent times gunshot injuries of the joints formed a class entailing the gravest anxiety
to the surgeon, both in regard to the selection of primary measures of treatment and in the
conduct of the after progress of the cases. The external wounds were severe, comminution of
the bones was great, and retention of the bullet within the articulation was not uncommon.
Operative surgery therefore found a large field in the extraction of bullets, removal of bone
fragments, excision of the joints, or even amputation of the limbs.

The introduction of bullets of small calibre has robbed these injuries of much of the importance
they possessed in earlier days and during the present campaign direct clean wounds of the joints
were little more to be dreaded than uncomplicated wounds of the soft parts alone. No more striking
evidence of the aseptic nature of the wounds, and the harmless character of the projectile
as a possible infecting agent, than that offered by the general course of these injuries in
this campaign, is to be found in the whole range of military surgery.

The aseptic nature of the wounds, and the slight and localised character of the bone lesions,
have in fact justified the opinion previously expressed by Von Coler, that these injuries in
the future would be less feared than fractures of the diaphyses of the bones.

Not less important than the localised character of the bone lesion itself is the fact that
the accompanying wounds of the soft parts retain the small or type forms. Thus I occasionally
observed more troublesome results from minor shell wounds in the neighbourhood of joints, but
not implicating the synovial cavity, than in actual perforating injuries produced by bullets
of small calibre.

Vibration synovitis.--Before proceeding to the consideration of wounds of the joints, a short
account is necessary of a condition of some importance which is, I believe, more or less special
to injuries from bullets of small calibre travelling at high rates of velocity. This condition,
if not novel, at any rate excited little comment in the descriptions of the older forms of
injury, although this may have depended on the more serious nature of the primary local lesions
accompanying wounds from the larger bullets, among which it formed a comparatively unimportant
element.

The condition referred to was the occurrence of considerable synovial effusion into the joints
of limbs in which the articulation itself was primarily untouched. These effusions sometimes
occurred even when the soft parts alone were perforated, especially when the wounds were situated
above or below the knee-joint. They were apparently the direct result of vibratory concussion
of the entire limb dependent on the blow received from the bullet.

The effusions were most strongly marked in cases of fractures of the diaphyses, although this
was more noticeable in some situations than others. Thus with fractures of the shaft of the
femur anywhere below the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the bone, and in some cases
even higher, effusion into the knee-joint was very common, and sometimes extreme. On the other
hand, similar effusions into the hip-joint were less marked, since I failed to determine their
existence in the majority of cases. I am inclined to ascribe this to the different anatomical
arrangement of the two joints, particularly to the fact that the head of the femur is included
in a bony cup, into the hollow of which it is accurately fixed by the resilient cotyloid fibro-cartilage.
The latter by its firm grasp of the head allows of little play in the joint; hence vibrations
are conveyed directly to the acetabulum in continuous waves, and rocking of the articular surfaces
is prevented. Beyond this no doubt the difficulty of detecting small effusions in this joint
is an element which must be taken into consideration.

I do not think that wrenches of the knee-joint in the act of falling can be suggested as an
explanation of the frequency of effusions into that articulation, since the fractures of the
femur were not always received while the erect position was maintained, and effusion was most
marked when the diaphysis was the part affected, the latter point illustrating the greater
resistance offered by compact bone. Again, when fracture had taken place, the solution of continuity
rendered the directly injured point the most mobile, and tended to prevent lateral strain from
falling on the joints.

Effusion into the knee or ankle, or sometimes both joints, was common in fractures of the shaft
of the tibia.

In the articulations of the upper extremity the condition was also common, but somewhat less
marked than in the lower limb. Effusions into the shoulder or elbow occurred. In the former
these were less striking; again, perhaps, as a result of the difficulty of detecting small
effusions in this situation. The elbow was to a certain extent protected by the possession
of a degree of fixity somewhat resembling that already mentioned in the case of the hip-joint,
although here depending on the conformation of the bones alone. I think this explained the
absence of free effusion in many cases of fracture of the humeral shaft, but when the latter
affected the lower third effusion into the elbow was usually abundant.

The lighter weight and greater mobility of the upper extremity as a whole, as decreasing the
resistance to the bullet, were also probably an element in the fact that these effusions were
less severe than those in the joints of the lower limb.

The nature of the effusions was apparently simple, since they were rapidly reabsorbed, and
little thickening of the synovial membrane remained to suggest either a marked degree of inflammation,
or the deposition of blood-clot on the inner aspect of the same.

The only treatment indicated was a short period of rest, accompanied in the early stages by
pressure and slight fixation, followed later by massage and movement if necessary.

Before dismissing this subject, I should like to particularly emphasise the fact, that in the
cases described there was no reason to suspect the extension of fissures from the point of
fracture in the shafts into the articular ends of the bones. This was as far as possible excluded
by clinical examination, and in the cases where wounds of the soft parts only were present,
the rapid return of the patients to active duty, with absence of remaining joint trouble, negatived
the possibility of such fractures.

I only saw one case in which a longitudinal fracture actually extended for any considerable
distance into a neighbouring joint. In this a comminuted fracture occurred just above the centre
of the shaft of the humerus. At the time of examination and putting up of the fracture there
was considerable swelling of the whole arm, and nothing special was noticed about the shoulder-joint.
Three weeks later, however, when the fracture was consolidating, difficulty in abduction of
the shoulder was noted, and the arm could not be placed closely in contact with the trunk.
There was no evident displacement of the head of the humerus forwards. A skiagram, which I
much regret I have not been able to insert, showed that a longitudinal fissure extended from
the seat of fracture upwards in such a manner as to divide the upper fragment into two parts,
of which the outer bore the greater tuberosity, the inner the articular surface of the head.
The latter fragment had become somewhat displaced downwards, and had united in such a manner
that the head rested on the lower part of the glenoid cavity. Abduction of the limb therefore
brought the greater tuberosity into contact with the acromion process, and movement was checked.
This case passed out of my observation shortly afterwards, and I have no knowledge of the final
result as to movement.

Fractures of the bony processes surrounding the elbow-joint, and of the malleoli of the tibia
and fibula, were not infrequent, but offered no special features.

One other form of injury indirectly affecting the joints is perhaps worthy of mention, but
I observed it only once, and that in the case of the shoulder, the only joint where it is likely
to be marked. I refer to the displacement of the head of the humerus by the force of gravity,
when the circumflex nerve is injured. In the instance I refer to, a fracture of the surgical
neck of the humerus was accompanied by complete motor paralysis of the deltoid and very rapid
wasting of the muscle. Circumflex sensation was impaired, but not absent at the time the condition
of the muscle was noted--a favourable prognostic sign of much importance. At the end of five
weeks, when the fracture of the bone was consolidated, the head of the humerus had dropped
vertically at least an inch, but could be replaced with ease. Shortly afterwards an improvement
in the condition of the muscle commenced, and with this the head of the humerus was gradually
raised. This patient later recovered his power in great part, but not completely.

In a few cases bullets lodged in the neighbourhood of joints in such positions as to limit
movement by mechanical impact with the bones. Thus I saw one case in which a bullet lay between
the radius and ulna just below the lesser sigmoid cavity; in another the bullet lay in front
of the ankle-joint, and limited the possibility of flexion; and in a case related to me by
Mr. Bowlby, a bullet was removed by him from the wall of the acetabulum where it was tightly
fixed in the substance of the bone. In two other cases I saw bullets lying deeply on the anterior
surface of the hip capsule and so limiting flexion. In all such cases the indication for removal
of the bullet was sufficiently strongly marked.

WOUNDS OF THE JOINTS

These may be divided into several classes, varying much in comparative severity, and in prognostic
importance.

1. The comparatively rare instances in which a wound implicated a joint cavity, without accompanying
lesion of any bone.

2. Perforating wounds in which the bullet was retained within the articular cavity. These were
also rare.

3. Wounds of the joints accompanied by grooving of the articular extremities of the bones.

4. Complete perforating tracks through the articular ends of the bones, crossing the joint
cavity in various directions.

5. Comminuted fractures of the terminal parts of the diaphyses extending into joints.

Of these several classes, the first was of the least prognostic importance. In the absence
of bone injury the wounds usually healed without any obvious ill effect beyond the transient
effusion into the joints of a mixture of blood and synovial fluid. When suppuration of the
wound in the soft parts occurred, however, the remarks made as to the injuries classed under
the third heading also apply here in a lesser degree.

With regard to the retention of the bullet, in the case of bullets of small calibre this was
a distinctly rare occurrence. I never happened to see an instance of retention of either a
Mauser or Lee-Metford bullet in an articulation. It is only possible with bullets practically
spent, or travelling at a very low rate of velocity and making irregular impact.

The influence of both volume and velocity of flight was well illustrated by my own small experience
of retained bullets. In one case a Martini-Henry was found impacted between the femoral condyles,
having slipped in beneath the margin of the patella. It caused a semiflexed position to be
assumed by the joint, and was removed by Mr. Brown in No. 1 General Hospital at Wynberg. The
second instance I saw in the Portland Hospital at Bloemfontein in a patient of Mr. Bowlby's.
The bullet was a Guedes, a form which has been already described as possessing low velocity
and deficient power of penetration; beyond this, in the particular instance irregular impact
was evidenced by the presence of a large irregular contused wound of entry over the tuberosity
of the tibia.

The presence of the bullet in the knee-joint was later determined by the X-rays, and Mr. Bowlby
removed it successfully. Seven months later the range of movement was nearly normal.

I may add that I saw several instances of large leaden bullets lodging in the popliteal space,
and a comparatively insignificant number of bullets of small calibre in the same situation.
This was very striking, in view of the immense relative frequency of use of the latter forms.
There is no doubt, moreover, that small bullets rarely lodge even in the neighbourhood of joints,
unless at the distal end of a long track. To take the extreme example of large bullets, those
employed as shrapnel, in comparison with the frequency with which wounds were produced by them,
bullets lying at the bottom of short tracks in the neighbourhood of joints were not uncommon.
Thus I saw one lying over the hip-joint, and another in close proximity to the shoulder capsule.

Wounds of the third class, where the bones had been superficially grooved, were in some respects
the most serious. This was especially so in the knee and ankle joints, and some cases will
be quoted later under the heading of the special joints to illustrate this point. Danger only
arose in the event of suppuration; and here the presence of the long oblique superficial track
in a neighbourhood liable to comparatively free movement was the important element. Such tracks
usually opened the synovial sac more extensively than direct perforating wounds, and if suppuration
occurred in any portion of the track, the pus was very liable to be sucked into the joint on
any free movement. The presence of fine splinters of the bone displaced in the production of
the groove was also a special character of wounds of this class. Another point worthy of mention
is that in these cases it was not always easy to be quite certain whether the joint cavity
had been implicated or not, since cases often occurred in which, although the bones had been
grooved, the joint cavity escaped. The indication, however, was to consider any wound in the
immediate proximity of a joint as perforating until it was healed. This course was the more
easy to take, since a large proportion of such wounds were accompanied by some degree of synovial
effusion, even when the neighbouring joint had escaped puncture.

Wounds of the fourth class, although the most highly characteristic of the form of accident,
were in many instances the most favourable in regard to their course. The tracks might course
directly across the joint in any direction, or they might course obliquely, traversing either
one or both the component bones. In the latter case the exit might be in the diaphysis, and
be accompanied by the separation of an exit fragment such as is illustrated in fig. 52, p.
169. The particularly favourable character of the direct transverse and antero-posterior wounds
depended on the slight amount of splintering of the bones, the limited nature of the opening
into the joint, and the shortness of the tracks in the soft parts, which ensured that, even
if infection did occur, the resulting pus was near the surface, and generally spread in that
direction and escaped.

Wounds of the fifth class were the most dangerous, but the danger was entirely a secondary
one, dependent on the occurrence of infection. These injuries were liable to be accompanied
by the presence of extensive irregular wounds of the soft parts, in which suppuration was frequent,
and the suppuration of the joint frequently meant subsequent amputation, if not a worse result.

Course and symptoms of wounds of the joints.--The immediate result of any perforation of a
joint was the development of intra-articular effusion. This consisted of synovial fluid admixed
with a varying proportion of blood. The degree of synovitis was apt to vary with the amount
of force expended in the production of the injury; for this reason both high velocity and irregular
impact were of importance in this relation.

The constant feature, however, depended on the effusion of blood; this was not rapid, or, as
a rule, very abundant, but tended to increase during the first twenty-four hours. It resulted
in a swelling of the joint, which possessed some peculiar features. At first elastic and resilient,
it slowly decreased in volume with the assumption of a soft doughy character on palpation.
In the case of the knee, where readily palpated, it very much resembled a tubercular synovial
membrane, except for its extreme regularity of surface; still more closely the condition noted
in a hæmophilic knee of some duration. Absorption took place with some rapidity, and except
for slight thickening, the joints might appear almost normal, in a period of from two to four
weeks. With the development of the effusion there was local rise in temperature of the surface,
and in a considerable number of the cases a general rise of temperature.

This latter was sometimes very marked, as in the case of all the other traumatic blood effusions,
but not quite so regular in occurrence. It was important, as I have seen it give rise to the
suspicion of suppuration, when tapping resulted in nothing more than the evacuation of turbid
synovia mixed with blood. Pain was rarely a prominent symptom in consequence of the generally
moderate degree of distension.

As a rule, these injuries were characterised by the small tendency to the development of adhesions;
but this in great part depended on the care expended on their treatment. If kept too long quiet,
either from necessity when the effusion was followed by much thickening, or when the external
wound was large and so situated as to be harmfully influenced by movement, or in the ordinary
course of treatment, troublesome stiffness, even amounting to firm anchylosis, sometimes followed.
I saw several such cases, some of the most confirmed being wounds of the knee-joint complicated
by injury to the popliteal vessels or nerves. The latter complication I saw altogether six
times, but only once with a thoroughly bad knee, and in this case the injury had affected both
the vessels and the internal popliteal nerve. The joint in that case was straightened out by
continuous extension by Major Lougheed, when it came under his charge some six weeks after
the primary injury, but I hear has again relapsed, and the popliteal paralysis is not much
improved.

The small tendency to formation of adhesions in uncomplicated cases probably depended on the
coagulation of a layer of blood over the whole internal lining of the joint. This kept the
synovial surfaces apart at the lines of reflection of the membrane, and, given sufficiently
active treatment, mobility was restored before any firm union could take place.

The primary escape of synovial fluid was rarely observed, as the wounds of the soft parts were
too small and valvular to permit of it. Synovia in some abundance, mixed with pus, sometimes
escaped in considerable quantity when infection had opened up the tracks.

Primary suppuration in any joint as a result of small and direct wounds was very rare. I observed
it only on one occasion. On the other hand, a considerable number of cases in which secondary
suppuration occurred came under my notice. In some of these the suppuration was secondary to
comminuted fractures of the shaft of the tibia, in which the articular extremity was implicated.
These offered no special peculiarity. In others infection of the joint was secondary to infection
and suppuration in the deep part of long oblique wound tracks, and these were of sufficient
interest to warrant the insertion of two illustrative cases.

     (43) In a man wounded at Paardeberg the bullet entered the leg
     to the inner side of the crest of the tibia, about 3 inches
     below the tubercle; thence it coursed upwards to emerge about 2
     inches above the cleft of the knee-joint on the outer side.
     Regulation dressings were applied, and a week later the man
     arrived at the Base, with little apparent mischief in the
     knee-joint. He was placed in bed and warned against movement;
     on the second day, however, he got up and walked to the
     latrine. When bending his knee to sit down he was seized with
     agonising pain in the joint, and had to call out for help; he
     was then carried back to bed in a more or less collapsed
     condition. The knee commenced to swell; there was rise of
     temperature and great pain, together with extreme restlessness.
     I was asked to see him two days later, and after a
     consultation, Major Burton, R.A.M.C., freely incised the
     knee-joint bi-laterally. One opening was closed, the second
     plugged for drainage, as there was a large quantity of pus. No
     improvement followed, and a week later Major Burton amputated
     through the thigh. An attack of secondary hæmorrhage a few days
     later, combined with the degree of septic infection, ended the
     man's life. On examination of the joint, a groove forming
     three-fourths of a tunnel was found in the external tuberosity
     of the tibia, leading into the knee-joint beneath the external
     semilunar cartilage. The bullet had then passed upwards over
     the outer border of the cartilage, bruised the margin of the
     external condyle of the femur in such a manner as to depress
     the outer compact layer, and finally escaped from the joint
     near the upper reflection of the synovial membrane. The
     synovial membrane was granular in appearance and reddened, but
     there was no suppuration outside the confines of the joint,
     except in a cavity corresponding to 2 inches of the track
     before it actually perforated the tibia. A localised abscess
     had evidently formed here and been diffused into the joint by
     the movement of flexion already described.

     (44) A man wounded during General Hamilton's advance on
     Heilbron was struck on the outer aspect of the heel. An oval
     opening of some size led down to a track in the os calcis; the
     bullet was retained. The foot was dressed, and put up later in
     a plaster-of-Paris splint. On the tenth day the splint was
     removed to see to the wound, which looked satisfactory and was
     re-dressed.

     A few hours later the man was seized with very severe pain in
     the ankle, and a day later I was asked to see him by Mr.
     Alexander. The man was anæsthetised, and I examined the wound
     with care, and also removed the retained bullet from the inner
     margin of the leg. The bullet was reversed, having no doubt
     suffered ricochet, hence the large aperture of entry, but it
     was in no way deformed. I could not certainly determine the
     presence of any fluid in the ankle-joint, and as the pain was
     apparently localised to the distribution of the
     musculo-cutaneous nerve, I decided not to freely open the
     joint. In this, however, I erred, and two days later, after
     consultation, the joint was freely incised by Mr. Alexander. It
     was then found that the bullet in its passage had just touched
     the posterior aspect of the tibia and wounded the ankle-joint.
     A localised collection of pus which had formed in the deep part
     of the wound had been diffused into the joint by the movements
     made when the splint was removed, in a similar manner to that
     described in the last case. This joint also did badly, and an
     amputation of the leg had to be performed by Mr. Alexander to
     save the man's life.

These two cases are particularly instructive as showing, first, how quietly a small amount
of deep suppuration may sometimes take place; and, secondly, the importance of keeping the
joints quiet on a splint when there is any reason to suspect their implication by wounds of
this character.

The general treatment of the wounded joints was simple. The old difficulties of deciding on
partial as against full excision, or amputation, were never met with by us. We had merely to
do our first dressings with care, fix the joint for a short period, and be careful to commence
passive movement as soon as the wounds were properly healed, to obtain in the great majority
of cases perfect results. Careful light massage, if available, was used to promote absorption
of blood.

If suppuration occurred, the choice between incision and amputation had to be considered. In
the early stages this choice depended entirely on the nature of the injury to the bones. If
this were slight, incision was the best plan to adopt. I saw several cases so treated which
did well, although convalescence was often prolonged, and only a small amount of movement was
regained. Amputation was sometimes indicated in cases of severe bone-splintering, when the
shafts were implicated, but was as a rule only performed after an ineffectual trial to cut
short general infection of the septicæmic type by incision.

I have dwelt at such length on the subject of suppuration on account of its importance, but
I should add that, on the whole, suppuration of the joints was uncommon, except in the case
of injuries far exceeding the average in primary severity.

Special joints.--Such deviations from the general type of injury as above described depended
entirely on peculiarities of anatomical arrangement, and peculiarities in the situation of
the joint clefts in the different parts of the body. A few words as to these are perhaps necessary.

Shoulder-joint.--Wounds of this articulation were by no means common. This depended, I think,
on two points in the architecture of the joint: first, a bullet to enter the front of the cavity
and traverse the joint needed to come with great exactitude from the immediate front; secondly,
wounds received from a purely lateral direction calculated to pierce the head of the humerus
and the glenoid cavity were naturally of very rare occurrence. Wounds of the prominent tip
of the shoulder received while the men were in the prone position were not uncommon, but it
was remarkable how rarely the shoulder-joint was implicated in these. The question of the narrow
nature of the cleft exposed also comes up in this position. As far as my experience went, injuries
to the lower portion of the capsule accompanying wounds of the axilla were those most often
met with. The ease and neatness with which pure perforations of the head of the humerus can
be produced was also an important element in the frequent escape of this joint. No case of
fracture of the glenoid cavity happened to come under my notice.

I saw few instances in which the joint needed incision, and cannot recall or find in my notes
any case in which serious trouble arose.

Elbow-joint.--Injuries to this joint came second in frequency in my experience to those of
the knee. They were, in fact, comparatively common, especially in conjunction with fractures
of the various bony prominences surrounding the articulation. Fractures of the lower end of
the humerus were of worse prognostic significance than those of the ulna, on account of the
greater tendency to splintering of the bone. I saw several cases of pure perforation of the
olecranon without any signs of implication of the elbow-joint. In a case which has been utilised
for the illustration of some of the types of aperture (fig. 20, p. 59), at the end of a week
there was no sign of any joint lesion, although the bullet had obviously perforated the articulation.

Several cases of suppuration which came under my notice did well. I saw one of them a few days
ago, six months after the injury, with perfect movement. In another of which I took notes,
the bullet entered over the outer aspect of the head of the radius, to emerge just above the
internal condyle anteriorly. A considerable amount of comminution of the olecranon resulted,
and when the man came into hospital some ten days later the joint was suppurating. The joint
was opened up from behind, and some fragments of bone removed by Mr. Hanwell. On the 26th day
this joint was doing well, and considerable flexion and extension were possible without pain.
There was a somewhat abundant discharge of bloody synovia during the first few days after the
operation.

I never saw any troublesome results from perforations of the carpus. The joints of the fingers
also offered little special interest, except in so far as they afforded astonishing examples
of the extreme neatness of the injuries which a small-calibre bullet can produce. Fig. 59 is
a good example of such an injury.

Hip-joint.--I can only repeat with regard to this joint what I have already said as to the
injuries to the head of the femur. I had practically no experience of small-calibre bullet
injuries to the femoral constituent, and beyond the single case of injury to the acetabular
margin mentioned on p. 193 I saw no obvious wounds of the joint at all.

The knee, as usual, proved itself par excellence the joint most commonly injured, no doubt
as a result of its size, the extent of its capsule anteriorly, and its exposed position. In
spite, however, of the frequency with which it suffered injury, and the opportunities it afforded
for observation of the progress of the effusions towards absorption, the injuries to the joint
gave less anxiety and attained a more favourable prognostic character than is the case in civil
practice. This depended on the very favourable course observed in the frequent pure perforations
following a direct line. These occurred in every direction, the accompanying hæmarthrosis usually
disappearing completely in an average period of little over a month. The extremes can be fairly
placed at a fortnight and six weeks. Limitation of movement was slight or non-existent in many
cases; in others it was of a very moderate character, and I only remember to have seen one
case in which a really serious anchylosis developed. In this the man was struck from a distance
of 300 yards, and a considerable amount of bone dust from the femur was found in the lips of
the exit aperture. The wounds healed per primam, but when I saw the man two months later anchylosis
in the straight position was apparently complete.

The comparatively frequent association of popliteal aneurisms with wounds of the knee-joint
has already been spoken of in relation to anchylosis. Wounds of the popliteal space from larger
bullets sometimes caused more troublesome after-stiffness than wounds of the articulation itself.
Again I remember a small pom-pom wound at the inner margin of the ligamentum patellæ without
obvious wound of the joint, which was accompanied by synovitis from contusion, and was followed
by very considerable limitation of movement. This had only been partially improved when the
patient returned home, in spite of prolonged massage and passive movement.

The general remarks on the joints cover all that need be said as to suppuration of the knee-joint.

The ankle-joint maintained the undesirable character which it has always held as a subject
for gunshot injuries. This is entirely a question of sepsis, and in great measure depends on
the fact that the foot, as enclosed in a boot, is invested with skin particularly difficult
to thoroughly cleanse; while the socks are an additional source of infection to the wounds
before the patients come under proper treatment.

Of seven cases of suppurating ankle-joint, of which I have notes, only two retained the foot,
and one of these after a very dangerous illness. This case was one of special interest as exemplifying
the results dependent on variations in velocity on the part of the bullet. The patient was
struck at a distance of twenty yards. The bullet entered the front of the right ankle-joint
and emerged through the internal malleolus, just behind its centre, causing no comminution
of the latter. It then entered the left foot by a type wound one inch behind and below the
tip of the internal malleolus, traversed and comminuted the astragalus, and emerged one inch
below the tip of the external malleolus. The first joint healed per primam. The second produced
by the bullet when passing at a lower rate of velocity was accompanied by considerable comminution
of the bone. It suppurated, and gave rise to great anxiety both for the fate of the foot and
the life of the patient. It is probable that the more abundant hæmorrhage which took place
from the second wound was in part responsible for the occurrence of infection.

The second of the two cases is of some interest in relation to the doctrine of chances as to
the position in which a wound may be received. The man was wounded in one of the earlier engagements,
a bullet passing transversely through his leg immediately behind the bones and about half an
inch above the level of the ankle-joint. He recovered, and rejoined his regiment, only to receive
at Paardeberg a second wound, about an inch lower, which traversed the ankle-joint. On his
return to Wynberg he happened to be sent to the same pavilion, and occupied the same bed he
had left on returning to the front.

The subject of the result of wounds of the joints of the foot has received sufficient consideration
under the heading of wounds of the tarsus.

The repetition of the fact that, among the whole series of cases on which this chapter is founded,
not a single instance of primary or secondary excision of a joint, either partial or complete,
is recorded, forms an apt conclusion to my remarks on this subject.

CHAPTER VII

INJURIES TO THE HEAD AND NECK

Injuries to the head formed one of the most fruitful sources of death, both upon the battlefield
and in the Field hospitals. It has been suggested that the mere fact of wounds of the head
being readily visible ensured all such being at once distinguished and correctly reported,
while wounds hidden by the clothing often escaped detection. When the external insignificance
of many of the fatal wounds of the trunk is taken into consideration this is possible; but,
on the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the head is in any attitude the most advanced,
and often the most exposed, part of the body, and even when the soldier had taken 'cover,'
it was frequently raised for purposes of observation. For the latter reasons I believe injury
to the head fully deserved the comparative importance as a fatal accident with which it was
credited.

A number of somewhat sensational immediate recoveries from serious wounds of the head have
been placed upon record. Observation, however, shows that these, with but few exceptions, belonged
either to certain groups of cases the relatively favourable prognosis in which is familiar
to us in civil practice, or that the wounds were received from a very long range of fire, and
hence the injuries were strictly localised in character.

ANATOMICAL LESIONS

Wounds of the scalp.--Nothing very special is to be recorded with regard to these; they either
formed the terminals of perforating wounds, or were the result of superficial glancing shots.
The glancing wounds were of the nature of furrows, varying in depth from mere grazes to wounds
laying bare the bone. Their peculiarity was centred in the fact that a definite loss of substance
accompanied them, the skin being actually carried away by the bullet; hence gaping was the
rule. Every gradation in depth was met with, but the only situations in which wounds of considerable
length could occur were the frontal region in tranverse shots, or, when the bullet passed sagitally,
the sides of the head, or the flat area of the vertex.

The danger of overlooking injuries to the bone was of special importance in the short subcutaneous
tracks occasionally met with at the points at which the surface of the skull makes sharp bends.
In all such wounds it was a safe rule to assume a fracture of the skull until this was excluded
by direct examination. In some of the gutter wounds and subcutaneous tracks crossing the forehead
and sides of the head, signs of intracranial disturbance were occasionally observed in the
absence of external fracture, such as transient muscular weakness, unsteadiness in movements,
giddiness, diplopia, or loss of memory and intellectual clearness. In connection with such
symptoms the classical injury of splintering of the internal table of the skull, the external
remaining intact, had to be borne in mind, but I observed no proven instance of this accident.
I am of opinion, moreover, that its occurrence with small bullets travelling at a high degree
of velocity must be very rare, since little deflection is probable unless the contact has been
sufficiently decided to fracture the external table; while in the cases of spent bullets the
injury is unlikely, as requiring a considerable degree of force.

Injuries to the cranial bones, without evidence of gross lesion to the brain.--It may be premised
that these were of the rarest occurrence, and they may be most readily described by shortly
recounting the conditions observed in a few cases I noted at the time. The injuries resulted
from blows with spent bullets, from bullets barely striking the skull directly, or those striking
over the region of the frontal sinuses. Wounds of the mastoid process will not be considered
in this connection as being of a special nature (see p. 299).

I saw only one case of escape of the internal, with depressed fracture of the external, table
of the skull.

     (45) In marching on Heilbron a man in the advance guard was
     struck by a bullet at right angles just within the margin of
     the hairy scalp. The regiment was at the time to all intents
     and purposes outside the range of rifle fire, and the patient
     was the only individual struck among its number. When brought
     into the Highland Brigade Field Hospital, a single typical
     entry wound was discovered; examination with the probe gave
     evidence of a slight depression in the external table of the
     frontal bone just above the temporal ridge. Although no
     perforation was detectible by the probe, and this was
     positively excluded on the raising of a flap (Major Murray,
     R.A.M.C.), it was considered advisable to remove a 1/4-inch
     trephine crown, the pin of the instrument being applied to the
     margin of the depression. No depression or splintering of the
     internal table was discovered, nor any injury to the dura, nor
     blood upon the surface of that membrane. The man made an
     uninterrupted recovery.

     (46) A case of frontal injury was shown to me at Wynberg, in
     which a distinct furrow could be traced across the upper part
     of the frontal sinuses. There had been no symptoms beyond
     temporary diplopia, and the wound was healed; no surgical
     interference had been deemed necessary.

     (47) In a man wounded at Poplar Grove, a single typical wound
     of entry was found 3/4 of an inch above the right eyebrow and
     the same distance from the median line. No primary symptoms
     were observed, but on the evening of the second day the
     temperature rose above 100° F., and the man seemed somewhat
     heavy and dull. The patient was examined by Major Fiaschi and
     Mr. Watson Cheyne, and it was decided to explore the wound. Mr.
     Cheyne removed fragments both of external and internal tables,
     one of the latter having made a punctiform opening, not
     admitting the finest probe, in the dura-mater. The bullet was
     traced into the nasal fossæ, where it was subsequently
     localised with the aid of the Roentgen rays when the patient
     came under my observation at Wynberg some days later (fig. 60).

Gunshot fracture of the skull with concurrent brain injury.--This was the commonest form of
head injury, and possessed two main peculiarities; firstly, the large amount of brain destruction
compared with the extent of the bone lesion; secondly, the fact that any region of the skull
was equally open to damage. In consequence of the second peculiarity, the position and direction
of secondary fissures are not so dependent on anatomical structure as in the corresponding
injuries of civil practice. Thus, fractures of the base, for instance, were less constant in
their course and position. The cases as a whole are best divided into four classes.

1. Extensive sagittal tracks passing deeply through the brain, and vertical wounds passing
from base to vertex or vice versa, in the posterior two thirds of the skull. These will be
referred to as general injuries.

2. Vertical or coronal wounds in the frontal region.

3. Glancing or obliquely perforating wounds of varying depth in any part of the head.

4. Fractures of the base.

Of these classes the first was nearly uniformly fatal; the second relatively favourable, and
with low degrees of velocity often accompanied by surprisingly slight immediate effects; while
the third had perhaps the best prognosis of all, but this varied as to the defects that might
be left, and with the region of the head affected.

1. General injuries.--Fractures of this class may be treated of almost apart. For their production
the retention of a considerable degree of velocity on the part of the bullet was always necessary,
and the results were consequently both extensive and severe.

The aperture of entry was comparatively small, since to take so direct and lengthy a course
through the skull the impact of the bullet needed to be at nearly an exact right angle to the
surface of the bone. Any disposition to assume the oval form, therefore, depended mainly upon
the degree of slope of the actual area of the skull implicated. In size the aperture of entry
did not greatly exceed the calibre of the bullet; in outline it was seldom exactly circular,
but rather roughly four-sided, with rounded angles, slightly oval, or pear-shaped. The margin
of the opening consisted of outer table alone, the inner being always considerably comminuted.
Fragments of the latter, together with the majority of those corresponding to the loss of substance
of the outer table, were driven through the dura mater and embedded in the brain. These bony
fragments were more or less widely distributed over an area of a square inch or more, and not
confined to a narrow track.

The amount of fissuring at the aperture of entry was often not so extensive as I had been led
to expect. Fig. 61 is a diagram illustrating a fairly typical instance; in some cases no fissuring
existed. As a rule the nearer to the base, the greater was the amount of fissuring observed.
The fissures were sometimes very extensive in this position, probably as a result of the lesser
degree of elasticity in this region of the skull. Again, when the aperture of entry was near
the parts of the vertex where sudden bends take place, considerable fissuring of the same nature
as that seen in the superficial tracks (fig. 68) was produced in the flat portion of the skull
above the point of entrance.

Radial fissuring around the aperture of entry in the skull scarcely corresponds in degree with
that seen when the shafts of the long bones are struck, and is far less marked and regular
than when one of these small bullets strikes a thick sheet of glass set in a frame. I saw several
apertures in the thick glass of the windows of the waterworks building at Bloemfontein produced
by Mauser bullets. They differed little from the opening seen in an ordinary plate-glass window
resulting from a blow from a stone, except perhaps in the regularity and multiplicity of the
radial fissures. As in the skull, the opening was a little larger than the calibre of the bullet,
and the loss of substance on the inner aspect considerably exceeded that on the outer.

The degree of fissuring is probably affected by the resistance offered by the particular skull,
or the special region struck, but as a rule the elasticity and capacity for alteration in shape
possessed by the bony capsule, is opposed to the production of the extreme radial starring
observed in the long bones or a fixed sheet of glass. Corroborative evidence of the influence
of elasticity in the prevention of starring is seen in the limited nature of the comminution
of the ribs in cases of perforating wounds of the thorax.

In the most severe cases we can only speak of the 'aperture' of exit in a limited sense in
so far as the opening in the scalp is concerned; this was often comparatively small, not exceeding
3/4 of an inch in diameter. Beneath this limited opening in the soft parts, the bone of the
skull was smashed in a most extensive manner. The portion exactly corresponding to the point
of exit of the bullet was carried altogether away, but around this point a number of large
irregularly shaped fragments of bone, from 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter, were found loose, and
often so displaced as to expose a considerable area of the dura-mater. Beyond the area of these
loose fragments, fissures extended into the base and vertex, in the latter case often being
limited in their extent by the nearest suture.

Over extensive fractures of this nature general oedema and infiltration of the scalp, due to
extravasation of blood, were present. When the exit was situated in the frontal region ecchymosis
often extended to the eyelids and down the face, while in the occipital region similar ecchymosis
was often seen at the back of the neck.

The opening in the dura mater at the aperture of entry was either slitlike, or more often irregular
from laceration by the fragments of bone driven in by the bullet. At the point of exit a similar
limited opening corresponded with the spot at which the bullet had passed, while separate rents
of larger size were often seen at some little distance. The latter were the result of laceration
of the outer surface of the membrane by the margins of the large loose fragments of bone above
described.

Injury to the brain more than corresponded in extent to the fractures of the bone. Pulping
of its tissue existed over a wide area both at the points of entrance and of exit. In the former
position the amount of damage was the less, the gross changes roughly corresponding with the
tissue directly implicated by the bullet itself, and the fragments of bone carried forward
by it. The degree of splintering of the skull therefore in great part determined the severity
of the lesion. At the exit aperture much more widespread destruction existed, while masses
of brain tissue, small shreds of the membranes, fragments of bone, and débris from the scalp
were found occasionally bound together by coagulated blood and protruding from an exit opening
of some size. The largest masses of such débris were most often seen in instances in which
the bullet had entered by the base to escape at the vertex of the skull.

The brain in the line of injury suffered comparatively slightly, but small parenchymatous hæmorrhages
into its tissue indicated in lesser degree the same type of injury undergone by the mass of
brain pulp and small blood-clots found at the external limits of the wound. Beyond this extensive
hæmorrhages at the base of the skull were common.

With regard to the extensive character of the brain destruction in the region of the aperture
of exit, it must be borne in mind that this lesion corresponds in position with one which would
exist even if the injury were of a non-penetrating degree. A large proportion of the contusion
and destruction is therefore explained by violent impact of the projected brain with the skull
prior to the passage of the bullet, and not to the direct action of the bullet on the tissues.

These cases of 'general injury' afford a marked example of the lesions to which the term 'explosive'
has been applied, and as such have an important bearing on the theories held as to the mode
of production of explosive effect. The increased area of tissue damage at the aperture of exit
favours the theory of direct transmission of a part of the force with which the bullet is endowed,
to the molecules of tissue bounding the track made by the projectile. Thus the area of destruction
corresponds with the cone-like figure which one would expect to be built up by the vibrations
spreading from the primary point of impact. The exit region of the skull is subjected not alone
to the force of the travelling bullet, but also to that exerted over a much wider area by the
tissue to which secondary vibrations have been communicated. The brain itself is, in fact,
dashed with such violence against the bone as to cause a great part of the injury.

No doubt the brain in its reaction to the bullet forms as near an approach to a fluid as any
solid tissue in the human body, and experimental observation has shown how greatly its presence
or absence in the skull affects the degree of comminution on the exit side; hence the fondness
for the so-called hydraulic theory that has been always exhibited in the case of these injuries.
The localisation of the injury in its highest degree to the neighbourhood of the exit aperture,
however, shows that in any case the main wave takes a definite direction in a course corresponding
to that of the bullet.

The real importance of the presence of the brain within the skull in increasing the amount
of damage at the exit end of the track, is as a medium for the ready transmission of forcible
vibrations. That the latter are to some extent conveyed as by a fluid is evidenced by the occasional
presence of brain matter and fragments of bone in the aperture of entry, which suggests recoil
or splash such as would be expected from a fluid wave.

Experience of the character of the lesions observed after severe concussion by the ordinarily
somewhat coarser forms of violence common to civil life, fully explains the severity of the
damage to the brain tissue met with in injuries due to bullets of small calibre. Viewing the
elaborate arrangements which exist for the preservation of the central nervous system from
the moderate vibration incidental to ordinary existence, it is easy to appreciate the harmfulness
of such exquisite vibratory force as that transmitted by a bullet of small calibre travelling
at a high rate of velocity.

Effect of ricochet in the production of severe forms of injury.--In connection with the lesions
above described mention must be made of cases in which the aperture of entry reaches a large
size, or a portion of the skull is actually blown away.

Examples of the former class were not uncommon; I will briefly relate one.

     (48) A Highlander while lying in the prone position at
     Rooipoort, was struck by a bullet probably at a distance of
     about 1,000 yards. A large entry wound in the scalp was
     produced, while the defect in the skull was coarsely comminuted
     and was capable of admitting three fingers into a mass of
     pulped brain. Both brain matter and fragments of bone were
     found in the external wound, which was situated just anterior
     to the right parietal eminence. The bullet passed onwards
     through the base of the skull, crossing the external auditory
     meatus, fracturing the zygoma and probably the condyle of the
     mandible, and eventually lodged beneath the masseter muscle.
     Blood and brain matter escaped from the external auditory
     meatus.

     The patient was brought off the field in a semi-conscious
     condition, the pupils moderately contracted but equal, the
     pulse 66, very small and irregular in beat, the respiration
     quiet and easy, and with paralysis of the left side of the
     body. The fæces had been passed involuntarily.

     The wound was cleansed and bone fragments removed. The patient
     had to travel in a wagon for the next three days until the
     column halted. The progress of the case was unsatisfactory, as
     the wound became infected, and the man eventually died on the
     14th day of general septicæmia, but with little evidence of
     local extension of septic inflammation.

     In this instance the head was no doubt struck by a bullet which
     had previously made ricochet contact with the ground. I saw
     several such cases.

Closely connected with such injuries are those in which large portions of the skull and scalp
were actually blown away. I never witnessed one of these myself, but I recall two instances
described to me by officers who lay near the wounded men on the field. In one the frontal region
was carried away so extensively that, to repeat the familiar description given by the officer,
'he could see down into the man's stomach through his head.' In a second case the greater part
of the occipital region was blown away in a similar manner, and this was of especial interest
as the wounded man was seen to sit up on the buttocks and turn rapidly round three or four
times before falling apparently dead. The observation offers interesting evidence of the result
of an extensive gross lesion of the cerebellum.

In the absence of exact information, it may well be that such injuries as the two latter were
produced by some special form of bullet, but as both were produced while the patients were
lying on the ground, and therefore especially liable to blows from ricochet bullets, I am inclined
to attribute both to this cause.

In considering injuries of the above nature, one cannot help speculating on the possible influence
of a head-over-heels ricochet turn on the part of the bullet while traversing the long sagittal
axis of the skull. It is not uncommon for apical target ricochets to present evidence of damage
to the apex and base of the mantle alone. This must depend on a rapid turn on impact, which
might well be imitated in the case of the skull, and would then go far to explain the production
of some of the most severe forms of explosive exit wounds met with. See cases 48, 54, 68.

Short of ricochet, the influence of simple wobbling must also be considered in shots from a
long range. The entry wound may be large as a result of this condition, but as the velocity
possessed by the bullet is low, the injuries would probably not be of a very severe nature.

In connection with the subject of wobbling, reference should be made to the form suggested
by Nimier and Laval, in which the wobble, as the result of resistance to the apex of the revolving
bullet, assumes the form of movement seen when the spin of a top is failing. This would explain
a peculiarity in some wounds of entry over the skull first pointed out to me by Mr. J. J. Day.
When such wounds were explored, as well as the presence of brain in the entry aperture, a number
of fragments of the external table of the skull were found everted and fixed in the tissues
of the scalp. As already suggested, this may be mere evidence of splash, but it may be equally
well explained by a process of wobble around the axis of revolution of the bullet. This might,
no doubt, also be invoked to explain the displacement of some of the fragments in fractures
of the long bones, where considerable resistance to the passage of the bullet is offered.

II. Vertical or coronal wounds in the frontal region.--These injuries were common, and offered
some of the most interesting illustrations of the variations in symptoms and effects following
apparently exactly identical lesions, judging from the condition of the external soft parts
alone; since the latter sometimes gave little indication of the force (dependent on the rate
of velocity) which had been applied.

With the lower degrees of velocity simple punctured fractures of the skull resulted, without
extensive lesion of the frontal lobes as evidenced by immediate symptoms. The nature of the
fractures differed in no way from the punctured fractures we are familiar with in civil practice.
The openings of entry in the bone were irregularly rounded, corresponding in size to the particular
calibre of the bullet concerned. The margin consisted of outer table alone, while the inner
table was either considerably comminuted, or a large piece was depressed, wounding the dura-mater
and projecting into the brain substance (see fig. 63). The aperture of exit presented exactly
the opposite characters, the splintering comminution or separation of a large fragment affecting
the outer table, while the inner presented a simple perforation. The latter condition is represented
in figs. 71 and 72, and I will here give short notes of four illustrative cases, as being the
shortest and most satisfactory method of conveying a correct idea of the nature of such injuries.

     (49) Vertical perforation of frontal bone.--Wounded at
     Belmont, while in the prone position. Aperture of entry
     (Mauser), at the anterior margin of the hairy scalp on the left
     side; course, through the anterior part of the left frontal
     lobe, roof of the left orbit, cutting the optic nerve and
     injuring the back of the eyeball, floor of the orbit, the
     antrum, the hard palate, and tongue. Exit, in mid line of the
     submaxillary region. No cerebral symptoms were noted, and on
     the fifth day the man was sent to the Base hospital without
     operation; the pulse was then 70 and the temperature normal.
     The movements of the eyeball were perfect, but blindness was
     absolute. At the Base hospital the eye suppurated and was
     removed. The patient was then sent home apparently well. He has
     since been discharged from the service, and is now employed as
     a painter in Portsmouth Dockyard.

     (50) Vertical perforation of frontal bone.--Wounded at
     Paardeberg while in the prone position. Range, 600-700 yards.
     Aperture of entry (Mauser), at the fore margin of the hairy
     scalp above the centre of the right eyebrow; course, through
     the anterior third of the right frontal lobe, roof of orbit,
     front of eyeball, margin of floor of orbit making a distinct
     palpable notch, and cheek; exit through the red margin of the
     upper lip, 1/2 an inch from the right angle of mouth. The
     bullet slightly grooved the lower lip.

     The patient rose almost immediately after being struck, and
     walked about a mile, although feeling dizzy and tired. The
     wounds, which both bled considerably, were then dressed. After
     three days' stay in a Field hospital, the patient was sent in a
     bullock wagon three days and nights' journey to Modder River
     and thence to the Base.

     There was anæsthesia over the area supplied by the outer branch
     of the supra-orbital nerve, extending from the supra-orbital
     notch backwards into the parietal region, but none over the
     area supplied by the second division of the fifth nerve.

     On the tenth day there were no signs of cerebral disturbance
     except a pulse of 48. The eyeball was suppurating, and the
     temperature rose to 99° at night. The lids were still swollen
     and closed.

     A few days later the eyeball was removed and at the same time a
     flap was raised and the fracture explored (Major Burton,
     R.A.M.C.). An opening somewhat angular, 1/3 of an inch in
     diameter, was found with a thin margin in the outer table of
     the skull (fig. 62); when this was enlarged with a Hoffman's
     forceps, an opening in the dura was discovered, and
     cerebro-spinal fluid escaped. A piece of the inner table of the
     skull (fig. 63), 3/4 by 1/3 an inch in size, was discovered
     projecting downwards vertically into the brain. This latter was
     removed and the wound closed. Healing by primary union
     followed, and no further symptoms were observed.

     (51) Transverse frontal wound.--Wounded at Paardeberg. The
     man was sitting down at the time he was struck, in the belief
     that he was out of the range of fire. The entry and exit
     wounds were almost symmetrical, placed on the two sides of the
     forehead at the margin of the hairy scalp, 2-1/4 inches above
     the level of the external angular processes of the frontal
     bone. The patient lost consciousness for about half an hour,
     then rose and walked half a mile to the Field hospital. The
     wounds were dressed, and after a stay of three days in
     hospital, the man was sent the three days' journey to Modder
     River; during the journey he got in and out of the wagon when
     he wished. After two days' stay at Modder, a journey was again
     made by rail to De Aar (122-1/2 miles). The wounds were healed.
     The man stayed at De Aar nearly a month, and then, rejoining
     his regiment, made a two days' march of some 22 miles on hot
     days. He had to fall out twice on the way by reason of
     headache, feeling dizzy, and 'things looking black.' He did not
     own to any loss of memory or intellectual trouble, but was
     invalided to England. This patient returned to South Africa
     later, and is now on active service.

     (52) Transverse frontal wound.--Within a few days an almost
     identical symmetrical wound in the frontal region occurred in
     the same district, from a near range. The patient became
     immediately unconscious, and remained so until his death some
     four days later, his symptoms being in no way alleviated by
     operation and the removal of a quantity of bone fragments and
     cerebral débris. At the post-mortem examination, extensive
     destruction of both hemispheres of the brain was revealed, and
     large fissures extended into the base of the skull.

III. Glancing or oblique perforating wounds of varying depth in any portion of the cranium.--These
injuries were the most common, the most highly characteristic of small-calibre bullet wounds,
the most interesting from the point of view of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, and beyond
this they formed the variety most unlike any that we meet with in civil practice.

They were met with in every region of the cranium, and in every degree of depth and severity.
The lesser are best designated as gutter fractures, the deeper are perforating and gradually
approximate themselves to the type of injury described as class 1.

When the bullet struck a prominent or angular spot on the skull a considerable oval-shaped
fragment was occasionally carried away, leaving an exposed surface of the diploë (case 60,
p. 274). Under these circumstances the apparent lesion on raising a flap was slight, but exploration
often showed extensive intra-cranial mischief. Thus in the case referred to both dura and brain
were wounded, and continuing hæmorrhage led to the development of progressive paralysis, relieved
only by operation.

From the more deeply passing bullets a more or less oval opening resulted, in which both tables
were freely comminuted and displaced. These cases differed from the typical gutter fracture
only in length and outline, and the nature of the accompanying intra-cranial lesion was identical,
while in the latter particular they differed much from fractures in which the impact of the
bullet was direct, in spite of a near resemblance in the appearances in the osseous defect.

I saw one instance in which a circular fissure about 1-1/2 inch from the actual opening of
entry surrounded the latter, the area of bone within the circle being somewhat depressed, though
radial fissures were absent.

In several of these cases fragments of lead were either found on the fractured surface of the
bone or within the cranial cavity, showing that the bullets had undergone fissuring of the
mantle, or had actually broken up on impact.

Gutter fractures.--The nature of the injury to the bones in these is best illustrated by a
series of diagrams of sections such as are shown below.

In the most superficial injuries the outer table was grooved and depressed, usually with loss
of substance from small fragments directly shot away: these latter had either been driven through
the wound in the soft parts, or remained embedded on the deep aspect of the enveloping scalp
(fig. 64). In the less common variety the scalp was slit to a length corresponding with the
injury to the bone, but more often oval openings in the skin existed at either end of the track.
The inner table was practically never intact, but the amount of comminution naturally varied
with the depth to which the outer table was implicated (fig. 65 A, and B).

The following is an illustrative example of this degree, and also emphasises the consequences
which may follow primary non-interference.

     (53) Superficial gutter fracture in parietal region.
     Convulsive twitchings. Secondary paralysis.--Wounded at Modder
     River. Range, 400 yards. A scalp wound 3 inches in length ran
     vertically downwards, commencing 1 inch from the median line,
     and situated immediately over the upper third of the right
     fissure of Rolando. The patient was unconscious for several
     hours after the injury, and later suffered with severe
     headache, and twitchings in the left shoulder and arm.

     The wound healed, but a well-marked groove was palpable in the
     bone beneath, and the twitchings persisted. The latter came on
     about every twenty minutes, and loss of power in the left upper
     extremity, and to a less degree in the lower, developed. The
     memory was defective, and the patient suffered at times with
     headache. The pupils were equal but sluggish in action. No
     changes were discovered in the fundus beyond a well-developed
     myopic crescent at the lower and outer part of the left disc
     (Mr. Hanwell).

     The twitchings became more frequent and latterly were
     accompanied by somewhat severe muscular contractions in the
     upper extremity, while the loss of power in the lower extremity
     became more marked. Headache was also more troublesome.

     The patient throughout refused any operation, saying he would
     rather go home first, and at the end of a month he left for
     England.

In the deeper injuries more and more of the outer table was cut away, and the inner became
gradually more depressed, fractured, or comminuted (fig 66).

Bevelling at the expense of the outer table at both entry and exit ends of the course existed,
but in either case a portion of the inner table was also detached and depressed. Sometimes
the depressed portion of the inner table was mainly composed of one elongated fragment; this
was either when the bullet had not implicated a great thickness of the outer table, or had
passed with great obliquity through especially dense bone (see fig. 70). When the bullet had
passed more deeply the inner table was comminuted into numberless fragments. I have frequently
seen 50 or 60 removed. Where such tracks crossed convex surfaces of the skull, the two conditions
were often combined; thus at one portion of the track, usually the centre, the comminution
was extreme, while at either end a considerable elongated fragment of inner table was often
found, the latter perhaps more commonly at the distal or exit extremity (fig. 67).

The nature of the injury to the bone when the flight of the bullet actually involved the whole
thickness of the calvarium was comparable to that seen in the case of the long bones when struck
by a bullet travelling at a moderate rate (see plate XIX. of the tibia, or what is illustrated
in the case of the pelvis in fig. 55). In point of fact, a clean longitudinal track appeared
to have been cut out. The length of these tracks naturally depended upon the region of the
skull struck. When a point corresponding to a sharp convexity, or a sudden bend in the surface,
was implicated, an oval opening of varying length in its long axis was the result; when a flat
area, as exists in the frontal or lateral portions of the skull, was the seat of injury, a
long track was cut.

Superficial perforating fractures.--These formed the next degree; the chief peculiarity in
them was the lifting of nearly the whole thickness of the skull at the distal margin of the
entry, and the proximal edge of the exit, openings; the flatter the area of skull under which
the bullet travelled the more extensive was the comminution. In some cases nearly the whole
length of the bone superficial to the track would be raised; in fact, the bullet having once
entered, the force is applied from within in exactly the same way that it operates on the inner
table in the gutter fractures. A corresponding injury is met with in the case of the bones
of the extremities (see fig. 57 of the tibia), and again the resemblance between these injuries
of the skull and such perforations of the long bones as are illustrated by skiagrams Nos. III.
and XXIII. of the clavicle and fibula is a close one.

I will add here a case of coexistent gutter fracture and perforating wound of the skull, the
conditions of the bone in which will illustrate the behaviour of the outer and inner tables
respectively, when struck with moderate force.

     (54) Wounded at Thaba-nchu. Guedes bullet. Entry behind left
     ear, just above posterior root of zygoma; gutter fracture;
     bullet retained within skull. Above and corresponding to right
     frontal eminence there was a hæmatoma, beneath which a loose
     fragment of bone was readily palpable. When brought into the
     Field hospital, twenty-four hours after the injury, the man
     appeared to understand when spoken to, but made no answers to
     questions. The urine was passed unconsciously, the bowels were
     confined.

     He was drowsy, the pupils widely dilated, the pulse 68, of good
     strength, and the temperature 104°. He slept well the following
     night and midday there was little change, except that the
     pupils acted to light, and the pulse had risen to 88, becoming
     dicrotic and small. The temperature was 103°, the tongue furred
     and dry, but he was lying with the mouth wide open.

     At 2 P.M. the wound was explored. The entry led down to a
     typical gutter fracture in the squamous portion of the temporal
     bone, at the point of junction of the vertical with the
     horizontal part; the floor of the gutter had been displaced
     inwards as a single fragment (fig. 70). A flap was raised in
     the frontal region, where a scale of outer table (fig. 71),
     clothed with diploic tissue, was found loose. Beneath this a
     puncture on the frontal bone, about corresponding in size to
     the bullet, was discovered. This opening was enlarged, and a
     bullet detected and removed. The bullet was a Guedes, with no
     marks of rifling, and was in no way deformed. At least a square
     inch of the right frontal lobe was pulped, so that the bullet
     lay in a cavity.

     The patient improved somewhat during the next two days, and on
     the third took a 16 hours' journey to Bloemfontein, where Mr.
     Bowlby (who was present at the operation) kindly took him into
     the Portland Hospital. The pulse gradually rose to 112, the
     temperature remained on an average from 102° to 103°, the
     respiration rose to 36, the face became somewhat livid, and on
     the sixth day death occurred rather suddenly, apparently from
     respiratory failure. For two days before his death the patient
     sometimes asked for food, &c.; there was occasional twitching
     of the left angle of the mouth, and, when the posterior wound
     was manipulated, some twitching of the fingers of the left
     hand. When the wound was dressed on the fourth day, there were
     breaking-down blood-clot and signs of incipient suppuration.

     Mr. Bowlby made a post-mortem examination, and found
     considerable pulping of the tip of the right frontal and left
     temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and a thick layer of hæmorrhage
     extending over the whole base of the brain.

The injury to the cranial contents varied with the degree of bone injury. Hæmorrhage on the
surface of the dura may in rare instances have been the sole gross lesion; I never met with
such a condition, however. In all the cases in which comminution had occurred, some laceration
of the dura, even if not more than surface damage or a punctiform opening, had resulted. In
the more serious gutter fractures an elongated rent of some extent usually existed. In the
perforating fractures two more or less irregular openings were the rule. The amount of hæmorrhage,
even if the venous sinuses were implicated, was on the whole surprisingly small, when the cases
were such as to survive the injury long enough to be brought to the Field hospital. I never
saw a typical case of middle meningeal hæmorrhage, although many fractures crossing the line
of distribution of the large branches came under observation. Case 60, p. 274, illustrated
the fact that the osseous lesions of lesser apparent degree are sometimes the more to be feared
in the matter of hæmorrhage, as compression is more readily developed.

The degree of injury to the brain depended on the depth of the track, the resistance offered
by the bones of any individual skull, the weight of the patient, but chiefly on the degree
of velocity retained by the bullet. It was sometimes slight and local as far as symptoms would
guide us; but in the majority of cases out of all proportion to the apparent bone lesion, if
the range was at all a short one. Cases illustrative of these injuries are included under the
heading of symptoms.

It will be, of course, appreciated that the coarse brain lesions under the third heading differed
in localisation and in extent alone, and in no wise in nature, from those observed in the two
preceding classes. The damage consisted in direct superficial laceration and contusion, and
beyond the limits of the area of actual destruction, abundant parenchymatous hæmorrhages more
or less broke up the structure of the brain, such hæmorrhages decreasing both in size and number
as macroscopically uninjured tissue was reached. No opportunity was ever afforded of examining
a simple wound track in a case in which no obvious cerebral symptoms had been present.

IV. Fractures of the base.--In addition to the above classes, a few words ought to be added
regarding the gunshot fractures of the base of the skull. These possessed some striking peculiarities;
first in the fact that they might occur in any position, and hence differed from the typically
coursing 'bursting' fractures we are accustomed to in civil life as the consequence of blows
and falls, and consequently were often present without any of the classical symptoms by which
we are accustomed to locate such fissures. Secondly, the peculiar form was not uncommon in
which extensive mischief was produced from within by direct contact of a passing bullet.

As far as could be judged from clinical symptoms, indirect fractures of the base such as we
are accustomed to meet in civil practice in connection with fractures of the vault were decidedly
rare, and, as has already been mentioned, ocular evidence of extensive fissures extending from
perforating wounds of the vertex was wanting, except in the extreme cases classed under heading
I. For these reasons I am inclined to regard them as uncommon.

Direct fractures of the base, on the other hand, were of common occurrence, especially in the
anterior fossa of the skull. These might be produced either from within, the most characteristic
form of gunshot injury, or from without. The fractures from within were often simple punctures
of the roof of the orbit or nose.

Punctured fractures of the roof of the orbit caused little trouble as far as the cranium was
concerned, but the orbital structures often suffered severely. I saw one or two very severe
comminutions of the roof of the orbit caused by bullets which had crossed the interior of the
skull; in one case the whole roof was in small fragments, while the damage in others was not
greater than chipping off some portion of the lesser wing of the sphenoid. The roof of the
orbit again was sometimes very severely damaged by bullets which first traversed that cavity
itself; thus in one case which recovered, the bullet passed transversely, smashing both globes,
and fracturing the roof of both orbits and the cribriform plate so severely as to lacerate
both dura-mater and brain, portions of the latter being found in the orbit on removal of the
damaged eyes.

Fractures of the middle and posterior fossæ were met with far less frequently, partly I think
because vertical wounds passing from the vertex to the base in these regions were with few
exceptions rapidly fatal, and partly from the fact that the occipital region, being ordinarily
sheltered from the line of fire, was rarely exposed to the danger of direct fracture from without.
As an odd coincidence I may mention that in my whole experience during the war I only once
saw bleeding from the ear as a sign of fracture of the base, apart from direct injuries to
the tympanum or external auditory meatus.

Symptoms of fracture of the skull, with concurrent injury to the brain.--These consisted in
various combinations of the groups of signs indicative of the conditions of concussion, compression,
cerebral irritation, or destruction. Although the symptoms possessed no inherent peculiarities,
yet certain characteristics exhibited served to illustrate the fact that, as a result of the
special mechanism of causation of the injuries, the type deviated in many ways from that accompanying
the corresponding injuries of civil practice.

The characters of the external wounds will be first considered, followed by some remarks concerning
the symptoms attendant on the different degrees and types of lesion, the symptoms special to
injuries to different regions of the head, and on the subsequent complications observed.

In the simplest injuries the type forms of entry and exit wound were found, and it has already
been observed that in these, if symmetrical, considerable difficulty existed in discriminating
between the two apertures. This is to be explained by the fact that the arrangement and structure
of the scalp are identical in corresponding regions; hence the only difference in the conditions
of production of the entry and exit wounds exists in the absence of support to the skin in
the latter. The granular structure of the hairy scalp is opposed to the occurrence of the slit
forms of exit, hence the openings were usually irregularly rounded. Any increase of size in
the exit wound in the soft parts due to the passage of bone fragments with the bullet, was
equalised in that of entry by the fact that the latter, as supported by a hard substratum,
was usually larger than those met with in situations where the skin covers soft parts alone.

In some cases of gutter fracture the wounds of entry were large and irregular, as a result
of upward splintering of the bone at the distal margin of the aperture of entry in the skull,
and consequent laceration of the scalp. Again, on the forehead very pure types of slit exit
wound were often met with in the position of the vertical or horizontal creases. With higher
degrees of velocity on the part of the bullet and consequent comminution at the aperture of
exit in the bone, the scalp was more extensively lacerated, and large irregular openings in
the soft parts, often occupied by fragments of bone and brain pulp, were met with. It is well
to repeat here, however, that the presence of brain pulp in a wound by no means necessarily
indicated the aperture of exit, for it was sometimes found in the entry opening also.

In the most severe cases, such as are included in class I., the exit wound often possessed
in the highest degree the so-called 'explosive' character. From an opening in the skin with
everted margins two or more inches in diameter a mass of brain débris, bone fragments and particles
of dura-mater, skin, and hair, bound together by coagulated blood, protruded as a primary hernia
cerebri if the patient survived the first few hours after the injury. In other cases of the
same class the actual opening was smaller, but the whole scalp was swollen and oedematous,
sometimes crackling when touched from the presence of extravasated blood in the cellular tissue,
while firm palpation often gave the impression that the head consisted of a bag of bones over
a considerable area.

Gutter fractures of the scalp were sometimes situated beneath an open furrow, gaping from loss
of substance, or beneath a bridge of skin; in the latter case they were usually palpable. Simple
punctures were also usually palpable, but the smallness of the openings sometimes rendered
their detection more difficult than might be assumed.

I never saw a case in which the skull escaped injury when the bullet struck the scalp at right
angles, but the frequency with which Mauser bullets were found within the helmets of men would
suggest that this must have sometimes occurred. A case of injury to the external table alone
has been described (p. 243). An illustration of the next degree of injury is afforded by the
following:--A bullet lodged in the centre of the forehead, the point lying within the cranial
cavity, while the base projected from the surface: this patient suffered but slight immediate
trouble, so little, indeed, that he merely asked his officer to remove the bullet for him,
as it was inconvenient. The bullet was subsequently removed in the Field hospital.

In a few cases the bullet entered the skull and was retained, when only a single wound was
found. Such cases are described in Nos. 54 and 68, where the position of the bullet was determined
by palpable fractures beneath the skin. With regard to the retention of bullets, however, in
small-calibre wounds, it was always necessary to examine the other parts of the body with great
care, and to ascertain, if possible, the direction from which the wound was received, as an
exit was often found some distance down the neck or trunk. Again the possibility of the opening
having been produced by glancing contact had to be considered.

In cases which survived the injury on the field, free hæmorrhage, as in wounds of other regions,
was rare, and although general evidence of loss of blood was often noted in patients brought
in, progressive bleeding was seldom observed. Again, when the wounds were explored, the amount
of blood, although considerable, was usually not more than sufficed to fill up the space consequent
on the loss of brain tissue. This was especially striking when large venous sinuses, as the
superior longitudinal, were involved in the injury. None the less, hæmorrhage at the base of
the brain was, I believe, responsible for early death in many of the severe cases, especially
when the wounds were near the lower regions of the skull.

Escape of cerebro-spinal fluid was not so prominent a feature as might have been expected,
considering how freely the arachnoid space was opened up in many cases. I think this was usually
checked by early coagulation of the blood, and later by adhesions. It must be remembered also
that extensive wounds were most common on the vertex, or at any rate over the convex surface
of the brain, while fractures of the middle fossa were usually rapidly fatal.

Concussion.--Cases exhibiting symptoms of pure uncomplicated concussion were distinctly rare,
as would be expected from the mechanism of the injuries. On the other hand, symptoms of concussion
formed the dominant feature of all severe cases.

The symptoms in many instances consisted in great part in transitory signs of the so-called
'radiation' type, such as are seen in destructive lesions where the signs of nervous damage
rapidly tend to diminish and localise themselves.

As to the causation of the 'radiation' symptoms, it is difficult to discriminate the effects
of neighbouring parenchymatous hæmorrhages from those of local vibratory concussion of the
nervous tissue. The local character of the signs seems, however, to point to causation by molecular
disturbance, resulting from the conduction of forcible mechanical vibration to the brain tissue
rather than to upset in the intra-cranial pressure. Again the limited nature of the paralysis
observed, sharply defines it from the general loss of power accompanying ordinary cases of
concussion of the brain. The similarity of the phenomena to those described in other parts
of the body under the heading of 'local shock' is sufficiently obvious.

The following instance well exemplifies the condition in question:

     (55) Wounded at Spion Kop. A scalp wound 3 inches in length
     crossed the left parietal bone nearly transversely, starting
     1-1/2 and ending 2 inches from the median line: the centre of
     the wound corresponded with the position of the fissure of
     Rolando. The patient was struck at a distance of fifty yards
     while kneeling; he fell and remained unconscious an hour and a
     half. Right hemiplegia without aphasia followed. The wound was
     cleansed and sutured, and in three days both arm and leg could
     be moved, after which time the man improved rapidly. Three weeks
     later when I saw him at Wynberg there was still comparative
     weakness of the right side, but beyond some neuralgia of the
     scalp, the man considered himself well. No groove could be
     detected on the bone on palpation. (This case offers a good
     example of the ease with which bone injury may be overlooked.
     The man came over to England 'well;' but while on furlough, two
     pieces of bone came away spontaneously. He is now again on
     active service.)

Compression.--Equally rare was it for pure symptoms of compression to be exhibited. This depended
on two circumstances: first, the rarity of injuries giving rise to meningeal hæmorrhage; secondly,
the fact that in nearly every case a more or less extensive destructive lesion was present,
at the margins of which less completely destroyed tissue remained, capable of giving rise to
symptoms of irritation. Again, as we have seen, free hæmorrhage into, or from the walls of,
the cavities produced in the brain was not a marked feature, and beyond this the large defect
in the cranial parietes was calculated to render a high degree of compression impossible.

As the most serious head injuries presented a remarkable similarity in their symptoms, I will
shortly summarise their common features.

Every degree of mental stupor up to complete unconsciousness was met with, but in some instances
where the pulse, respiration, and general bodily condition pointed to speedy dissolution, the
patients answered rationally often between moans or cries indicative of pain.

Widespread paralysis often existed, but this was seldom completely general; more commonly it
was combined with extreme restlessness of the unparalysed parts, or sometimes, even when the
whole of one hemisphere was tunnelled, and in all probability widely destroyed, restlessness
was the only symptom. In some cases twitching of the features or the limbs or severe convulsions
were superadded.

The pupils were rarely unequal, and at the stage in which these patients were first seen were
usually moderately contracted. Wide dilatation was uncommon throughout.

The pulse was with very few exceptions slow, sometimes irregular. In some instances, when the
wounds had been thought suitable for exploration, the slow pulse was altered after operation
to a rapid one, and death usually quickly supervened.

Respiration was irregular, sometimes sighing; in the late stage often of the Cheyne-Stokes
type; actual stertor was exceptional, but the respiration was often noisy.

The temperature was often raised from an early stage to 99° or 100°, and if the patient survived
a day or two, it often rose to 103° or 104°. How far the secondary rise depended on sepsis
it was not always easy to determine. The urine was usually retained.

Cases presenting the above characters were usually those suffering from lesions such as are
described in class I., and mostly died in twenty-four to forty-eight hours. The correspondence
of the train of symptoms with those due to combined brain destruction and severe concussion
is at once apparent.

To illustrate the nature of the symptoms in patients suffering from the less extensive forms
of injury, such as those included in classes II. and III. under the heading of anatomical lesion,
the relation of a short series of histories will be advisable. I may first premise, however,
that the special characteristics of these were in some instances the almost entire absence
of primary symptoms of gravity; in others general symptoms of a severity out of apparent proportion
to the external lesion; while in all destructive lesions, very widely distributed radiation
symptoms developed, often disappearing with great rapidity.

The symptoms consisted in those of concussion, irritation, local pressure, and actual destruction.

The symptoms of concussion were either general, and then usually transient, or local paralysis
of the radiation variety, which also rapidly improved.

Signs of irritation consisted in irritability of temper, drowsiness, closure of the eyes and
objection to light, contracted pupils sometimes unequal, a tendency to the assumption of the
flexed position at all the joints, twitchings, and sometimes convulsions. Sometimes these appeared
early as a direct result of mechanical irritation from bone fragments or blood-clot; sometimes
only in the course of a few days, as a result of irritation of parts recovering from the radiation
effects which had prevented earlier nervous reaction. Possibly in some cases the symptoms of
irritation depended upon an increase in the amount of hæmorrhage, and in others upon the development
of local inflammatory changes.

Local pressure, or actual destruction of brain tissue, was evidenced by temporary paralysis
in the former, permanent loss of function in the latter, condition.

Fractures of the anterior fossa of the skull were attended by very marked evidence of orbital
hæmorrhage, as subconjunctival ecchymosis (rarely pure), increased tension, and proptosis.

Injuries to the cranial nerves at the base, with the single exception of lesion of the optic
nerves, which was not rare, were in my experience uncommon in the hospitals--a fact pointing
to the very fatal nature of direct basal injuries, except in the anterior fossa of the skull.
Signs indicative of injury to the olfactory lobe were occasionally observed.

I should, perhaps, again insist here on the rarity with which acute diffuse septic infection
occurred in cases of these degrees of severity, also on the fact that interference with the
wounds in the way of secondary exploration, even when they were manifestly the seat of local
infection, was followed almost without exception by good immediate results; and, lastly, that
when suppuration did occur, it was usually strictly local in character. The influence of the
climate of South Africa and our surroundings has already been discussed, but whether climate,
condition of the patients, or peculiarity in the nature of causation of the wounds was responsible,
in no series of cases was the absence of acute inflammatory troubles more striking than in
this one of brain injuries.

Frontal injuries were those most frequently unaccompanied by primary symptoms of severity;
slowing of the pulse--this often fell to 40--and occasional irregularity, were almost the only
constant signs of cerebral damage. Some patients temporarily lost consciousness, others rose
at once and walked to the dressing station, and in few cases was any psychical disturbance
noted in the early stages.

I think, however, it may be affirmed that frontal injuries, accompanied by trivial signs, resulted
without exception from the passage of bullets travelling at a low rate of velocity. Thus in
several of the instances here related the patients at the time of reception of the wound were
under the impression that they were entirely beyond the range of fire, and in one, in which
well-marked signs of concussion followed, the bullet, which had traversed the head, retained
only sufficient force to perforate the skin of the neck and bury itself in the posterior triangle
without even fracturing the clavicle, against which it impinged. In men struck at a shorter
range, signs of concussion, often followed by transient radiation signs of injury to the parietal
lobe, were common. These signs were, I think, not as a rule due to surface hæmorrhage, since
they were of a purely paralytic nature and not irritative. Several cases with partial or complete
hemiplegia, hemiplegia and aphasia, or facial paralysis are recorded below.

     (56) Frontal injury.--Wounded at Magersfontein. In prone
     position when struck, distance 700 to 800 yards. Entry
     (Mauser), at the margin of the hairy scalp above and to the
     left of the frontal eminence; course, through anterior third of
     left frontal lobe, roof of orbit, obliquely across line of
     optic nerve, inner wall of orbit, nose, right superior maxilla
     piercing alveolar process, and passing superficial to inferior
     maxilla: exit, one inch anterior to angle of jaw. The bullet
     again entered the posterior triangle of the neck, struck the
     right clavicle, and turned a somersault, so that its base lay
     deepest in the wound.

     The patient was unconscious for a short time, suffered with
     general headache and giddiness, and was somewhat irritable. On
     the third day the pulse was 70, temperature normal, and he was
     sent to the Base. There was considerable proptosis, oedema
     and discoloration of the eyelid, and subconjunctival
     ecchymosis, but the movements of the eyeball could be made and
     light could be distinguished. The sense of smell was apparently
     absent. A week later the headache was gone, the pulse numbered
     80 to 90, the temperature was normal, he slept well, sat up in
     bed and smoked, took his food well, and exhibited no cerebral
     symptoms. He could detect the smell of tobacco, but not as a
     definite odour.

     No further symptoms were noted, the sense of smell returned,
     the swelling of the eyelid and proptosis decreased, but the
     upper lid could not be raised. When the lid was drawn up, there
     appeared to be vision at the margins of the field with a large
     central blind spot. The patient left for England at the end of
     a month apparently well.

     (57) Gutter fracture of frontal bone.--Wounded at Paardeberg.
     Entry (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch within the margin of hairy
     scalp above outer extremity of right eyebrow; gutter fracture;
     exit, 2 inches nearer middle line, at the same distance from
     the margin of the hairy scalp. The patient was knocked head
     over heels, his main feeling being a sense of dulness in the
     right great toe. He sat up and got a first field dressing
     applied, then lay down, but as he was still under fire, he
     retired 1,000 yards to the collecting station; here he dressed
     some patients, and later mounted an ambulance wagon and was
     driven to the Field hospital. The next day he helped with the
     work of the hospital, amongst other things controlling the
     artery during an amputation of the arm. He then took a three
     days' and nights' journey to Modder River in a bullock wagon,
     during which journey he had a fit, which was general, the
     thumbs being turned in and a wedge being necessary between the
     teeth to prevent him biting his tongue.

     On the sixth day the wound was examined, and between this and
     the tenth day he had several fits of the same nature as the
     first, accompanied by stertorous breathing and profuse
     sweating. On the tenth day Mr. Cheatle opened up the wound and
     removed numerous fragments of bone, leaving a clean gutter 2
     inches by 3/4 of an inch. After the operation no further fits
     occurred, and eight days later he was conscious, but was
     excitable and talked at random. On the twentieth day he arrived
     at the Base after 30 hours' railway journey (623 miles). He was
     then quite rational, but unable to make any demands on his
     memory and very sensitive to noise; at times he wandered in the
     evenings and his temperature rose as high as 100°. The wound
     was open and granulating, the floor pulsating freely.

     Three weeks later the wound was still open, and the skin dipped
     in at the lower margin. The mental condition was much improved,
     although attempts at giving a history of his case were
     obviously tiresome.

     The wounds in the leather headband of this patient's helmet
     were interesting, the round aperture of entry in the exterior
     of the helmet being followed by a starred exit aperture in the
     leather band, the second entry opening in the leather band
     being again circular, and the external opening in the puggaree
     a transverse slit.

     (58) Transverse superficial perforating frontal
     injury.--Wounded at Graspan. Aperture of entry
     (Lee-Metford), at upper and outer part of left frontal
     eminence; exit, at margin of hairy scalp over outer third of
     right eyebrow. On the second day the patient complained of
     giddiness and headache; the pulse was 60. He was then walking
     about. The wounds were explored and typical entry and exit
     apertures discovered in the frontal bone from which cerebral
     matter was protruding. Both openings were enlarged (Mr. S. W.
     F. Richardson) with Hoffman's forceps, and a considerable
     number of splinters of the inner table were removed from the
     aperture of entry.

     The headache gradually passed off, but there was throbbing
     about the scar, and pulsation was visible for some three weeks,
     after which no further symptoms were observed.

     (59) Oblique frontal gutter fracture.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), 1/2 an inch to right of median
     line of forehead, 3/4 of an inch from the margin of the hairy
     scalp; exit, about 3/4 of an inch anterior to the lower
     extremity of the right fissure of Rolando. Weakness of left
     facial muscles, especially of angle of mouth. No further motor
     symptoms. Wounds explored (Mr. Stewart); numerous fragments of
     bone and some pulped cerebral matter were removed. Patient
     developed no further signs; the paralysis, although improved,
     did not completely disappear. The man a year later was still on
     active duty, the paralysis almost well, and no further ill
     effects of the injury remained.

In the fronto-parietal or parietal regions, signs of damage to the cortical motor area were
seldom absent, sometimes evanescent, at others prolonged. In some cases the signs were permanent
and followed by evidence of local sclerosis.

The motor area on both sides of the brain was sometimes implicated; thus in a child shot at
Kimberley the bullet entered in the right frontal region, and emerged to the left of the line
connecting bregma and inion a little behind its centre. Paralysis of both lower extremities
resulted, power rapidly returning in the right, while incomplete paralysis persisted in the left.

In only one instance (see case 73, p. 292) was any permanent sensory defect observed, and the
mental condition of this patient would have certainly suggested a functional explanation for
its presence, had it not been for the accompanying inequality in the axillary surface temperatures.

In a second case (No. 67) blunting of sensation followed a definite lesion of the inferior
parietal lobule. In this instance an occipital lesion was associated with the parietal.

     (60) Parietal gutter fracture.--Wounded at Magersfontein. A
     scalp wound 3 inches in length ran transversely across the
     right parietal bone at the level of the lower third of the
     fissure of Rolando. A second wound of entry was found crossing
     the third dorsal spine; the bullet was retained and was
     palpable over the right scapula. There was left facial
     paralysis, weakness and numbness of both upper extremities,
     especially of the left, and some difficulty in swallowing. The
     man was sent to the Base, where he arrived on the fourth day.
     The symptoms had then become much more marked, consciousness
     was incomplete, and articulation slow and imperfect. There was
     complete left hemiplegia, and deviation of the tongue to the
     right. The pulse was 40. An exploration (Mr. J. J. Day) showed
     that an oval plate of the outer table of the parietal bone had
     been struck off. A trephine was applied to the exposed diploë
     and a crown of bone removed; considerable comminution of the
     inner table had occurred, several large fragments having
     perforated the dura-mater. The latter did not pulsate; it was
     therefore freely incised, and many more fragments of bone and a
     large quantity of blood-clot removed.

     The first effect of the operation was slight, but ten days
     later rapid improvement commenced, the first sign being
     acceleration of the pulse, which rose to 70. On the eighteenth
     day the original symptoms still remained to a diminished
     extent, but a fortnight later there remained traces of the
     facial weakness only, and there was little difference in the
     grip of the two hands. The patient was shortly afterwards sent
     home. Ten months later he returned to South Africa on active
     service.

     (61) Fronto-parietal gutter fracture.--Wounded at Graspan.
     Entry (Mauser), 1 inch within the margin of the hairy scalp,
     1/2 an inch to the left of the median line; exit, 3-1/2
     inches posterior in same line. Complete right-sided hemiplegia.
     The wounds were explored on the fourth day (Major Moffatt,
     R.A.M.C.) and a gutter fracture involving the frontal and
     parietal bones exposed. The dura-mater was lacerated and brain
     matter from the frontal lobe escaped freely. A large number of
     bone fragments were removed. On the fourth day after the
     operation, the patient became unconscious with right-sided
     twitchings, but rapidly improved, and at the end of three
     weeks, except for slight headache, he was well, the power of
     the right side being good. Ten months later he rejoined his
     regiment in South Africa, no apparent ill effects remaining.

     (62) Fronto-parietal perforating fracture.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. Entry, within the margin of the hairy scalp;
     exit, behind and below the left parietal eminence, the track
     crossing about the centre of the fissure of Rolando. Right
     hemiplegia, the lower half of the face only being involved. The
     wounds were explored and a large number of fragments of bone
     and a quantity of pulped cerebral matter removed. Six days
     later the hemiplegia persisted, speech was slow, headache was
     troublesome and the pulse not above 45. After this, gradual
     improvement took place, and a month later the lower extremity
     and face had regained good power. The upper extremity remained
     flaccid and paralysed, except for some slight power of movement
     of the shoulder.

     (63) Fronto-parietal perforating fracture.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), 2-1/2 inches from the median
     line, 3-1/2 inches from the occipital protuberance; exit, 3/4
     of an inch from the median line, 4-1/2 inches from the
     glabella; sanious fluid escaped from both ears. There was left
     facial paralysis, complete paralysis of the left upper
     extremity, and partial paralysis of the left lower extremity.
     The patient was deaf, drowsy, and the pulse 45.

     Exploration showed the entry wound to be in the parietal, the
     exit to involve both parietal and frontal bones. The openings
     were enlarged, and a number of fragments of bone, together with
     pulped cerebral matter and blood-clot, were removed. The wound
     healed, except at the front part, where a small prominence
     suggested a hernia cerebri.

     The patient improved slowly; fourteen days after the operation
     he could hear well, and the flow from the ears had ceased. The
     facial weakness was slight, the upper extremity was still
     powerless, but he could move the lower and draw it up in bed.
     At the end of six weeks the wound had healed, and he was got up
     and dressed.

     At the end of two months he was well enough to be sent home;
     there was only a trace of facial weakness; the right upper
     extremity, however, was powerless and slightly rigid,
     occasional twitchings occurring in it. Considerable power had
     been regained in the lower extremity, so that the patient could
     walk with help, but foot-drop persisted; the gait was spastic
     in character, the reflexes were much exaggerated, and there was
     marked clonus. The patient was sensible, but his manner
     suggested some mental weakness. Both the openings in the skull
     were closed by very firm material, apparently bony.

     This patient became a Commissionaire some ten months later. His
     mental condition is normal, and loss of memory seems confined
     to the events immediately following the injury. The lower
     extremity has improved, but the upper is useless.

     (64) Parietal injury: retained bullet.--Wounded at
     Paardeberg. Aperture of entry (Mauser), 1 inch diagonally
     below and anterior to left parietal eminence. No exit. The
     patient was trephined by the surgeons of the German ambulance
     at Jacobsdal.

     Sixteen days later he arrived at the Base. A circular pulsating
     trephine opening was then to be felt beneath the flap, but no
     information was forthcoming as to the bullet. The patient
     could speak, but lost words and the gist of sentences; he
     could remember nothing as to himself since the day of the
     injury. There was right facial weakness; he could not close the
     right eye or whistle, but there was little apparent want of
     symmetry; there was weakness in the grip of both hands, more
     marked on the right side; both lower extremities could be
     moved. The reflexes were normal, although the left limb was
     slightly rigid. The pupils were equal, reflex normal; slight
     nystagmus. Pulse 72, small and regular. Temperature normal.
     Rapid improvement followed.

     During the fourth week the temperature rose to 103°, and
     remained elevated for six days, but no local or general signs
     appeared; at the end of five weeks there was little evidence of
     the paralysis remaining. The patient was discharged from the
     service on his return home.

In the upper part of the occipital region glancing or superficial injuries were comparatively
favourable; those near the base, especially if perforating, were very dangerous. Two such cases
are referred to elsewhere. Case 69 is included as the only example of cerebellar injury I happened
to see who lived any appreciable time after the accident.

The main interest in these cases centres in the defects produced in the area of the visual
field. I am extremely indebted to my colleague, Mr. J. H. Fisher, who has kindly determined
this for me in three of the following cases. It will be noted that in two instances the injury
was to the left occipital lobe. In these the resulting hemianopsia was of the pure lateral
homonymous character, and in both the visual symptoms were accompanied by a certain degree
of amnesic aphasia (65 and 68).

In 65 the injury was definitely unilateral, and at the time of the operation I decided that
at least an inch and a half of the posterior extremity of the left occipital lobe was totally
destroyed.

In 68 the lesion was probably confined to the left lobe, but it is impossible to exclude slight
injury to the right lobe also. In this instance amnesic aphasia was a far more marked symptom
than in 65, and the position of the lesion suggested damage both to the visual and auditory
word centres.

Cases 66 and 67 are instances of damage to both occipital lobes. In 66, although the wound
was a glancing one, and did not perforate, it was so near the median line, and accompanied
by such severe damage to the bone, that a symmetrical lesion of the cuneate and precuneate
lobules of both right and left sides is to be inferred. In 67 the great longitudinal fissure
was traversed by the bullet obliquely. It is of great interest to observe that in each of these
cases the lesion of the visual field was a horizontal one and affected the lower half in place
of assuming a lateral distribution.

In all four cases the primary effect of the occipital injury was the same--viz. absolute blindness--while
the return of vision in each was of the nature of the dawning of light. I regret that I am
unable to furnish any detail as to increase of the field of vision in the progress of the cases,
but circumstances rendered continuous observation of the patients impossible.

In each case deafness was apparently the direct result of concussion of the ear on the side
corresponding to the wound. Deafness of the opposite ear was never noted.

In case 67 some general blunting of sensation was noted in the paralysed upper extremity, and
in this patient, no doubt, injury to the inferior parietal lobule accompanied the occipital lesion.

     (65) Injury to left occipital lobe.--Wounded at Belmont. A
     single transverse wound, 2 inches in length, extended across
     the occipital bone, 2 inches above the level of the external
     protuberance. When seen on the third day the wound was gaping
     and pulped cerebral matter was found in it. The patient was
     very drowsy, lying with closed eyes, and complaining of great
     coronal and frontal headache. He could distinguish light and
     darkness, but not persons. Total blindness immediately followed
     the injury, persisting some three days, and the patient spoke
     of return of sight as of the appearance of dawn. The pupils
     were equal, moderately dilated and acted to light, which was
     unpleasant to him. He was somewhat irritable and silent, but
     apparently rational. Temperature 99°. Pulse 56 full. Tongue
     clean. No sickness, no difficulty in micturition.

     Fifty-six hours after the injury the wound was opened up and
     cleaned, and an oval fractured opening about 3/4 by 1/2 inch
     was exposed 3/4 inch to the left, and 2 inches above the
     occipital protuberance. The margins of the opening showed
     several small fragments of lead attached to the bone. A
     3/4-inch trephine was applied at the left extremity of the
     opening, and it was found that about a square inch of the
     internal table was comminuted and driven into the brain,
     together with several small fragments of lead. On introducing
     the finger, about 1-1/2 square inches of the occipital lobe
     were found to be pulped, and the finger could be swept across
     the tentorium. There was no sinus hæmorrhage (nor did the
     history suggest that hæmorrhage had ever been severe). The
     cavity was carefully sponged out, and the wound closed with a
     drainage aperture. Little change followed in the patient's
     condition, and on the sixth day he was sent to the Base
     hospital.

     Three weeks later the wound was firmly healed. The patient
     still complained of frontal headache, and wore a shade, as the
     light hurt his eyes and made them water freely. The pupils
     acted, but were wide; objects could be distinguished, and also
     persons. Otherwise, the man's condition was good: he began to
     get up, and at the end of six weeks returned to England.

     A year later the man was earning his living as a Commissionaire
     porter. He complains of giddiness when he stoops, or when he
     looks upwards, and at times he suffers much with headache both
     in the region of the injury and across the temples.

     There is a bony defect and slight pulsation at the site of the
     injury, but no prominence. When attempts are made to read the
     lines run together, and a dark shadow comes before his eyes. He
     speaks of the latter as still terribly weak. Speech is slow and
     somewhat simple, but he makes no mistakes as to words. Memory
     is bad for recent events.

     Mr. Fisher makes the following report as to the eyes: Pupils
     and movement of eyes normal in every respect. No changes in
     fundi.

          Vision, R. 5/12 with--0.5   5/6
                  L. 5/9  with--0.5   5/5

     There is therefore practically full direct vision. Though the
     man chooses a concave glass he is not really myopic. There is
     typical right homonymous hemianopsia; the answers, when tested
     with the perimeter, are quite certain, and the fields
     absolutely reliable.

     The man's statements confirm the condition; he is aware of his
     inability to see objects to his right-hand side, and is apt to
     collide with persons or objects on that side.

     The lesion is one of the left occipital cortex in the cuneate
     lobe and the neighbourhood of the calcarine fissure. The speech
     suggests a slight degree of aphasia.

     (66) Injury to occipital lobes.--Wounded at Magersfontein
     while in prone position. Distance, 500 yards. He says he was
     never unconscious, but for two days was absolutely blind. His
     eyesight gradually improved, but headache was very severe, and
     sleeplessness nearly absolute. On the eighth day the wound,
     which was situated over the right posterior superior angle of
     the parietal bone, was opened up, and a number of fragments of
     bone and a quantity of pulped brain removed from a depressed
     punctured fracture, surrounded by an annular fissure,
     completely encircling it, 1-1/2 inch from the opening. The
     portion of brain destroyed was probably a considerable portion
     of the cuneate and precuneate lobules of both sides, as well as
     a portion of the first occipital convolution, and the superior
     parietal lobule of the right side. There was no evidence of
     injury to the superior longitudinal sinus in the way of
     hæmorrhage.

     After the operation the patient slept better, but still
     complained of headache, and when he arrived at the Base, the
     flap became oedematous, and the stitch holes and also the
     central part of the wound suppurated. The temperature rose to
     101°. The wound was therefore re-opened, and a number of
     additional fragments of bone, some as deeply situated as 2
     inches from the surface, were removed. Steady improvement
     followed, and at the end of a further three weeks the wound was
     healed, the headache had ceased, and there were no abnormal
     symptoms, except that light was unpleasant to the right eye,
     and the field of vision was manifestly contracted (Mr. Pooley).

     A year later the man was employed as a letter-carrier. He
     complains of headache at times, and on six occasions has had
     'fainting fits.' He says that the latter commence with tremor,
     that his legs then give way and he falls. In a quarter of an
     hour he gets up, and feels no further inconvenience. Speech is
     perfect, there is no deafness. The bone defect is very nearly
     completely closed.

     Mr. Fisher reports as follows as to the vision. There is a high
     degree of hypermetropia in each eye, the R. has nearly 6.0 D
     and the L. about 5.0 D. With correction he gets practically
     full direct vision with each.

     The patient has been examined before, and has been informed
     that his vision quite incapacitates him from further service.
     He began by stating that he could not see on either side of
     him, but only straight in front; that he is apt to collide with
     people in walking, was nearly knocked down by a horse, and that
     his acquaintances accuse him of passing them unnoticed. The
     fields of vision are very small, but the loss is not typically
     in the temporal half of either. That of the right eye which we
     know as the spiral field, becoming more and more contracted as
     the perimeter test is continued, is what is found in functional
     cases; that of the left, however, shows a characteristic loss
     of the lower part of the field of vision, and agrees with the
     statement of the man that he can see the upper part of my face
     but not the lower when he looks at me. Such a loss agrees with
     a lesion involving the upper part of the cuneate lobe above the
     calcarine fissure.

     I feel satisfied that there is considerable loss in the right
     field also, but the functional element obscures its exact
     nature.

     The fundi, pupils, and ocular movements are all normal.

     (67) Injury to occipital lobes and left motor and sensory
     areas.--Wounded outside Lindley (Spitzkop). Range within 1,000
     yards. Entry, one inch within the right lateral angle of the
     occipital bone, external wound more than 1/2 an inch in
     diameter; exit, 2 inches from the median line, over the upper
     half of the left fissure of Rolando. Behind the wound of exit
     comminution of the parietal bone, extending back to the
     lambdoid suture, existed. I attributed this to oblique lateral
     impact by the bullet on the inner surface of the skull.

     The patient could afterwards remember being struck, but became
     rapidly unconscious. When brought into the Field hospital some
     five hours later the condition was as follows: Semi-conscious,
     can speak, apparently blind, pupils equal, of moderate size, do
     not react to light. Right hemiplegia. No sickness. Moans with
     pain in head. Passes water normally.

     Considerable hæmorrhage had occurred from each wound, the scalp
     was puffy, and the bones yielded on pressure over the left
     parietal bone, indicating considerable comminution.

     The night was so cold that no operation could be considered, so
     the head was partly shaved, the wounds cleansed, and a dressing
     applied. The next morning the Division marched at 5 A.M., and
     it was considered wise to leave the man at Lindley in the local
     hospital.

     No operation was performed there, but I heard later that the
     man recovered full consciousness at the end of five days, and
     at the end of a fortnight he commenced to see again.

     Six weeks later he travelled to Kroonstadt, thence to
     Bloemfontein, and thence to Cape Town and home to Netley. The
     paralytic symptoms meanwhile steadily improved.

     Seven months later his condition is as follows: Scarcely a
     trace of facial paralysis. Slight power of movement of arm,
     forearm, and fingers, but grip is very weak. Little power of
     abduction of the shoulder or of straightening the elbow. The
     latter movement is made with effort and in jerks. Sensation
     over the back of the arm is somewhat lowered, and is 'furry' at
     the finger tips. There is very little wasting of the muscles
     noticeable.

     Walks well, but with some foot-drop. Slight increase of
     patellar reflex. He says that he does not walk in the street
     with confidence, as he often feels as if omnibuses &c. were
     coming too near him.

     He is absolutely deaf in the right ear.

     The openings in the skull are closed, the occipital lies about
     halfway between the external auditory meatus and the external
     occipital protuberance, while the parietal still affords
     evidence of the earlier comminution, one fissure passing
     backwards as far as the lambda, and the whole surface is lumpy
     and uneven.

     The track through the brain no doubt involved a considerable
     extent of the outer aspect of the right occipital lobe and the
     cuneate lobule. It must also have crossed the great
     longitudinal fissure, and penetrated the left Rolandic region,
     just above its centre, probably involving the precuneate
     lobule, and a portion of the internal capsular fibres as well
     as the cortex on the left side. The deafness was probably due
     to concussion of the internal ear.

     Mr. Fisher has kindly furnished the following note regarding
     the vision. The pupils, movements, and fundi are quite healthy.
     There is good direct vision R. or L. 5/5 fairly, and together
     5/5. The man complains he has lost his side sight, also the
     lower; he demonstrates the latter quite obviously with his
     hand, and says he has to repeatedly look down when walking. He
     thinks no improvement has taken place during the last month.
     The accompanying fields of vision show the loss quite
     characteristically.

     (68) Injury to left occipital lobe.--Wounded at Paardeberg.
     Entry (Mauser), through the lambdoid suture on the right side
     of the mid line. Bullet retained, but a palpable prominence
     behind the left ear suggested its localisation.

     The patient became at once unconscious and remained so for
     several days. He was completely blind; vision returned later,
     but only to a limited degree. There was complete loss of
     memory as to the events of the day.

     When admitted at Rondebosch into No. 3 General Hospital the
     condition was as follows: The field of vision is limited, and
     examination shows right homonymous hemianopsia. When any one
     comes into the tent the patient sees a shadow only until his
     bed is reached.

     When spoken to the patient 'thinks and thinks,' and then
     apologises for not answering, saying he will remember at some
     future time. He is absolutely unable to remember times, names,
     or localities, but places his hand to his head and appears to
     think deeply in the effort to recall them. Occasionally when
     you go into his tent he suddenly remembers something he has
     been trying to think of for some days, and will tell you.

     A fortnight later after an attack of influenza the patient was
     not so well, and vision was apparently becoming more impaired.

     An incision was made (Mr. J. E. Ker) so as to raise a flap the
     centre of the convexity of which was 2-1/2 inches behind the
     left external auditory meatus. A slight prominence and a
     fissure was discovered in the temporal bone, and over this a
     trephine was applied. On removal of the crown of bone the
     bullet was discovered with the point turned backwards (having
     evidently undergone a partial ricochet turn) on the upper
     surface of the petrous bone, just above the lateral sinus. The
     dura-mater was healed but thickened, and some clot upon its
     surface was removed.

     The wound healed per primam, and a rapid recovery was made. Ten
     days later a running water-tap was able to be detected 120
     yards from the tent door. The hemianopsia however persisted.

The following letter, dictated by the patient to his wife, and sent to me, gives a clear account
of his condition ten months later:--

     I am pleased to say my memory is better than it was some time
     ago, though at times I am entirely lost and really forget all
     that I was speaking about. I also find that I often call things
     and places by their wrong names. I sometimes try to read a
     paper or book which I have to read letter by letter, sometimes
     calling out the wrong letter, such as B for D &c., and by the
     time I have read almost halfway through, I have forgotten the
     commencement.

     My sight is about the same. There is no improvement in the
     right eye, and the doctor at Stoke said that the left eye was
     not as it ought to be and might get worse.

     I ofttimes go to take up a thing, but find I am not near to it,
     though it appears to me so.

     I have no pain to speak of in the head, though at times a
     shooting pain.

     I have a continual noise in the left ear as if of a locomotive
     blowing off steam, and a deafness in the left ear which I had
     not before being wounded.

I am extremely indebted to my friend Mr. J. Errington Ker for the notes of the above case,
so successfully treated by him.

     (69) Injury to occipital lobe.--Wounded at Modder River.
     Scalp wound in occipital region. Two days later on arrival at
     the Base the patient was extremely restless and in a condition
     of noisy delirium. The wound was explored (Mr. J. J. Day) and a
     vertical gutter fracture discovered 1/2 an inch above and to
     the left of the occipital protuberance. The gutter was 1-1/2
     inch in length and finely comminuted, the dura wounded, and the
     left occipital lobe pulped. A number of fragments of bone (one
     lodged in the wall of, but not penetrating, the lateral sinus)
     and pulped brain were removed. No improvement took place in the
     general condition, but the patient lived twenty-two days,
     during which time he coughed up a large quantity of gangrenous
     lung tissue and foul pus.

     At the post-mortem examination a wound track was found
     extending to the crest of the left ilium, where the bullet was
     lodged. The patient was no doubt lying with his head dipped
     into a hole scooped out in the sand (a common custom) when
     struck; the bullet then traversed the muscles of the neck,
     entered the upper opening of the thorax, where it struck the
     bodies of the second and third dorsal vertebræ, one third of
     the bodies of each of which were driven into an extensive
     laceration of the lung; it then grooved the inner surfaces of
     the eighth and ninth ribs, fractured the tenth and eleventh,
     and passing the twelfth traversed the deep muscles of the back
     to the pelvis. Beyond the injury to the occipital lobe, the
     cerebellum was found to be lacerated and extensively bruised
     and ecchymosed.

Complications.--Hernia cerebri as a primary feature has already been mentioned as one of the
peculiarities of some explosive wounds. In the later stages of the cases in which primary union
did not take place the development of granulation tumours was often seen, sometimes in connection
with slight local suppuration, sometimes over a cerebral abscess. In some cases a wound which
had once closed reopened and a hernia developed. This sequence was chiefly of prognostic significance
as an indication of intra-cranial inflammation, usually of a chronic character, and affecting
rather the lowly organised granulation tissue formed in the cavity than the brain itself. When
primary union of the skin flap and wound failed, the process of definitive closure of the subjacent
cavity was always a very prolonged one, and it was in such cases that a great proportion of
the so-called herniæ developed.

Abscess of the brain.--Local abscesses formed in a considerable proportion of the cases where
serious damage to the brain had occurred, in whatever region this happened to be. I never saw
one develop in cases where primary union had taken place, even when bone fragments had not
been removed; neither did I ever see an abscess situated at a distance from the original injury.
I take it that the latter is to be explained by the early date of the suppuration, and the
fact that in the great majority of small-calibre wounds the exit opening exists in the situation
of the contre-coup damages of civil practice.

The main feature in the symptoms when abscesses developed was the insidious mode of their appearance,
usually at the end of fourteen to twenty-one days, and their comparative mildness.

Very slight evidences of compression were observed; thus, varying degrees of headache, drowsiness,
irritability of temper or depression, twitchings, or in some cases Jacksonian seizures, combined
with slow pulse and slight rises of temperature. I never happened to see complete unconsciousness.
The slight evidence of compression was perhaps explained in most cases by the large bony defect
in the skull, which acted as a kind of safety-valve. Again the firm nature of the cicatricial
tissue which formed at the periphery of the injury and extended up to the skull and there formed
a more or less firm attachment, also preserved the actual brain tissue to some degree from
either pressure or direct irritation. After evacuation of the pus, the usual difficulty was
experienced in ensuring free drainage, and definitive healing and closure of the cavities was
very slow. The following two cases will illustrate the character of the cases of cerebral abscess
we met with:--

     (70) Fronto-parietal abscess.--Wounded at Magersfontein
     (Mauser). Entry, 1-3/4 inch above the line from the lower
     margin of the orbit to the external auditory meatus, and 1-3/4
     inch behind the external angular process; exit, a little
     posterior to the left parietal eminence. There was right
     hemiplegia. The wounds were explored, and a large number of
     fragments of bone and pulped brain were removed, especially
     from the anterior wound. No great improvement followed, and the
     patient was sent to the Base. At this time there was a large
     hernia cerebri at the anterior wound which was suppurating.

     A further operation was here performed (Mr. J. J. Day). The
     hernia cerebri was removed, also several fragments of bone
     which were found deeply imbedded in the brain. The patient then
     improved, but a month later his temperature rose, and on
     exploration an abscess was discovered in the frontal lobe and
     drained.

     Subsequently the patient suffered with Jacksonian seizures,
     sometimes starting spontaneously, sometimes following
     interference with the wound. The convulsions commenced in the
     muscles of the face, and the twitchings then became general.
     Meanwhile the right upper extremity remained weak, although the
     fist could be clenched, and all movements of the limb made in
     some degree.

     Some difficulty was experienced in maintaining a free exit for
     the pus, which was however overcome by the use of a silver
     tube. All twitchings ceased about a month after the opening of
     the abscess, the man improved steadily, and he left for England
     fifteen weeks after the reception of the injury, walking well,
     with a firm hand-grip, and the wounds soundly healed.

     (71) Frontal injury. Secondary abscess.--Wounded at Modder
     River. Aperture of entry (Mauser), just external to the
     centre of the right eyebrow; exit, above the centre of the
     right zygoma. The wound did not render the man immediately
     unconscious, but he lost all recollection of what had happened
     to him for the next three or four days. The wounds were
     explored on the second day, at which time the patient was in a
     semi-conscious drowsy state, the pupils contracted and the
     pulse slow. A number of fragments of bone and pulped brain
     matter were removed.

     Subsequently to the operation the patient showed more signs of
     cerebral irritation than usual, lying in a semi-conscious state
     and more or less curled up. He answered questions on being
     bothered. He improved somewhat, and was sent to the Base,
     where the improvement continued, but he suffered much from
     headache.

     Later the headache became much more severe, and eleven weeks
     after the injury the man complained of great pain both locally
     and over the whole right hemisphere; he lay moaning, with the
     temperature subnormal, and the pulse very slow. At times there
     was nocturnal delirium.

     The wound had remained closed and apparently normal, but now a
     small fluctuating pulsating nipple-like swelling developed in
     the situation of the aperture of entry. This was incised, and
     two ounces of sweet pus evacuated (Professor Dunlop). A tube
     was introduced, and removed later on the cessation of
     discharge.

     Removal of the tube was followed by a recurrence of the same
     symptoms, and this occurred on no fewer than six occasions
     whenever the wound closed.

     At the end of twenty weeks the patient appeared quite well, the
     wound had been closed six weeks, the previously irritable
     mental state was replaced by placidity, and he was sent home.

Diagnosis.--The importance of proper exploration of scalp wounds to determine the condition
of the bone has already been insisted upon. The localisation of the position and extent of
the injury to the cranial contents depended simply on attention to the symptoms, and needs
no further mention here.

Prognosis.--This subject can only be very imperfectly considered at the present time, since
only the more or less immediate results of the injuries are known to us, while the more important
after consequences remain to be followed up.

As to life the immediate prognosis has been already foreshadowed in the section on the anatomical
lesions. It is there shown that the first point of general importance is the range of fire
at which the injury has been received. At short ranges, as evidenced by the history, the characters
of the wounds, and the severity of the symptoms, the immediate prognosis was uniformly bad,
a very great majority of the patients dying, and that at the end of a few hours or days.

The rapidity with which death followed depended in part on the actual severity of the wound,
and still more on the region it affected; the nearer the base and the longer the track the
more rapidly the patients died, and this always with signs of failure of the functions of the
heart and lungs due to general concussion, pressure from basal hæmorrhage, or rapid intracranial
oedema. In my experience no patients survived direct fracture of the base in any region but
the frontal, although many, no doubt, got well in whom fissures merely spread into the middle
or posterior fossa. Patients with very extensive injuries at a higher level, on the other hand,
often survived days, or even a week, then usually dying of sepsis.

The actual relative mortality of these injuries I can give little idea of, but it was a high
one both on the field and in the Field hospitals; thus of 10 cases treated in one Field hospital,
after the battle at Paardeberg Drift, no less than 8 died; while of 61 cases from various battles
who survived to be sent down to the Base during a period of some months, only 4 or 6.55 per
cent. died. Many of the latter, as is seen from the cases here recorded which were among the
number, were none the less of a very serious nature. The early causes of death in patients
dying during the first forty-eight hours have been already mentioned; the later one was almost
always sepsis.

As in civil practice the best immediate results were seen in injuries to the frontal lobes,
and after these in injuries to the occipital region. In the latter permanent lesions of vision
were, however, common. The above injuries apart, the prognosis depended on the severity and
depth of the lesion. The frequency and extent of radiation symptoms often made it possible
to give a more hopeful prognosis than the immediate conditions seemed to warrant, if the exact
situation of the lesion, and the probable velocity at which the bullet was travelling, were
taken into account; since the actual destructive lesion, when the velocity had been insufficient
to cause damage of a general nature, was often very strictly localised.

Another very important point in the immediate prognosis was the primary union of the scalp
wound; if this could only be ensured, few cases went wrong afterwards. Such remote effects
as I witnessed were mainly the results of the actual destructive lesion, such as paralyses
and contraction. I know of only one case in which early maniacal symptoms closely followed
on a frontal injury, and here the symptoms accompanied the development of an abscess. Some
patients were depressed and irritable, and some were blind or deaf, probably from gross lesion;
in one patient the mental faculties generally were lowered.

In spite of the surprising immediate recoveries which occurred, and the small amount of experience
I am able to record as to remote ill effects of these injuries, I feel certain that a long
roll of secondary troubles from the contraction of cicatricial tissue, irritation from distant
remaining bone fragments, as well as mental troubles from actual brain destruction, await record
in the near future.

Since my return to England I have heard of four cases of injury to the head, which died on
their return, as the result of the formation of secondary residual abscesses; and of one who
died suddenly, soon after his return to active service in South Africa apparently well. These
occurrences are sufficiently suggestive.

It may be of interest to add here two cases of secondary traumatic epilepsy of differing degree:--

     (72) Gutter fracture over left temporo-sphenoidal lobe.
     Traumatic epilepsy.--A trooper in Brabant's Horse was wounded
     at Aliwal North, in March, in several places. A Mauser bullet
     entered the head 1-1/2 inch above the junction of the anterior
     border of the left pinna with the side of the head. The exit
     wound was situated just below and behind the left parietal
     eminence. The patient stated that the shot was fired by a man
     he recognised in a laager 150 yards distant from him.

     The man remained unconscious eleven days, and when he came
     round paralysis of the right upper extremity, and weakness of
     both lower extremities, were noted. There was also ataxic
     aphasia.

     The wounds healed, but two months later the man began to suffer
     from fits every few days. He spoke of them as fainting fits,
     but they were accompanied by general twitchings.

     The patient was shown to me in July by Major Woodhouse,
     R.A.M.C. The strength of the right upper extremity was then
     good, and he walked well. Speech was slow, but correct. The
     pupils were equal, and acted normally.

     The mental condition was weak, and the temper irritable. The
     man had hallucinations, and was very obstinate: there was
     complete deafness of the left ear. He refused surgical
     treatment, but was really hardly a responsible individual.

     (73) Gutter fracture in right frontal region. Traumatic
     epilepsy.--Wounded at Pieter's Hill. Gutter fracture crossing
     the outer aspect of the frontal lobe, immediately above the
     level of the right Sylvian fissure. The wound was perforating
     at the central part, but only reached as far back as the lower
     end of the ascending frontal convolution. The patient was
     rendered unconscious and was removed to Mooi River. He was
     there seen by Sir William MacCormac, who removed a number of
     fragments of bone. The patient rapidly recovered consciousness
     after the operation, but was completely hemiplegic. After a
     month he suddenly found he was able to move his lower
     extremity, and later the paralysis became steadily less.

     On his return home the man obtained employment as a
     Commissionaire, but nine months after the injury, while his
     wife was helping him on with his coat one morning, he was
     suddenly seized with a fit; the paralysed arm was jerked up,
     and convulsions became general, a wedge needing to be inserted
     to prevent the tongue suffering injury.

     When admitted into the hospital, the cicatrix of the wound was
     considerably depressed, and the central part was evidently
     continuously attached to the surface of the brain. Pulsation
     was both visible and palpable, there was little or no
     tenderness on examination, and the patient did not complain of
     pain.

     Little trace of the left facial paralysis remained. The man
     walked well, but with foot-drop. The left upper extremity was
     rigid, but chiefly from the elbow downwards. The fingers were
     flexed, but a slight increase of grip could be effected. No
     other active movements of hand. The elbow was held flexed, but
     could be straightened to about 3/4 range on effort. The
     shoulder could be slightly abducted, but wide movements were
     made by the scapular muscles.

     Sensation was dull over the left side of the face, also over
     the left side of the neck. There was complete loss of cutaneous
     sensibility over the lower half of the forearm and hand, and a
     similar patch in the left axilla. Over the rest of the
     extremity the sensation was better on the flexor than on the
     extensor aspects. There was little alteration in the common
     sensation elsewhere, except that the contrast between that of
     the dorsum and sole of the foot was somewhat more marked than
     usual. The temperature of the insensitive axilla was one degree
     higher than that of the right.

     The left knee jerk was somewhat exaggerated.

     On December 15 an incision was made through the old cicatrix
     directly over the defect in the skull. On separating the skin
     it was found directly adherent to the cicatrised dura, and when
     this was incised a large vicarious arachnoid space was opened
     up. The space was crossed by a number of strands of connective
     tissue, and the cavity had no epithelial lining. The fluid ran
     out freely, and the space was evidently in free communication
     with the general arachnoid cavity. A trephine crown was taken
     out at the posterior end of the gutter, and the surface of the
     brain explored, but no fragments of bone were found. I
     therefore replaced the crown, and closed the bony defect in the
     floor of the gutter with a plate of platinum fitted into a
     groove made in the bony margin. The wound was then sutured.
     Primary union took place, and there was no constitutional
     disturbance beyond one temperature of 100° on the evening of
     the second day; otherwise the temperature remained normal, and
     the pulse did not rise above 75.

     On the second evening a fit occurred, coming on while the
     patient was apparently asleep. It lasted about a quarter of an
     hour and was general, the patient becoming for a short time
     unconscious, and passing water involuntarily.

     On the third morning two similar fits occurred, the first a
     severe one, during which the patient passed a motion
     involuntarily. The commencement of all three fits was observed
     by the nurse only, but in each the convulsions apparently
     commenced in the face and then became general.

     Three months later no further fits had occurred, and the
     patient, who throughout had said he felt remarkably well,
     complained of nothing. The upper extremity was apparently
     slightly less rigid than before the exploration, and the
     patient said he walked somewhat better than before. The closure
     of the skull was perfect.

Treatment.--The treatment of fractures of the skull possesses a degree of surgical interest
that attaches to no other class of gunshot injury, since operative interference is necessary
in every case in which recovery is judged possible. The injuries are, without exception, of
the nature of punctured wounds of the skull, and the ordinary rule of surgery should under
no circumstances be deviated from. An expectant attitude, although it often appears immediately
satisfactory, exposes the patient to future risks which are incalculable, but none the less
serious. Happily the operations needed may be included amongst the most simple as well as the
most successful, and expose the patient with ordinary precautions to no increase of risk beyond
that dependent on the original injury.

Cases of a general character, or in which the base has been directly fractured other than in
the frontal region, are seldom suitable for operation, since surgical skill is in these of
no avail; but in all others an exploration is indicated. I use the word 'exploration' advisedly,
since what may be called the formal operation of trephining is seldom necessary except in the
case of the small openings due to wounds received from a very long range of fire; in all others
there is no difficulty, but very great advantage, in making such enlargement of the bone opening
as is necessary with Hoffman's forceps.

The scalp should be first shaved and cleansed; if for any reason an operation is impossible,
this procedure at least should be carried out, with a view to ensuring, as far as possible,
future asepsis, infection in head injuries being almost the only danger to be feared. The shaving
may need to be complete, but local clearance of the hair suffices in many cases. The hair having
been removed, the scalp is cleansed with all care, a flap is raised of which the bullet opening
forms the central point, and the wound explored. In slight cases the entry opening is the one
of chief importance, and the exit may be simply cleansed and dressed. In some instances, as
in direct fracture of the roof of the orbit from above, the exit should not be touched.

The flap having been raised, if the wound be a small perforation, a 1/2-inch trephine crown
may be taken from one side; but it is rare for the opening to be so small that the tip of a
pair of Hoffman's forceps cannot be inserted. The trephine is more often useful in cases of
non-penetrating gutter fractures where space is needed for exploration, and the elevation or
removal of fragments of the inner-table. Loose fragments may need to be removed from beneath
the scalp, but the important ones are those within the cranium. These may either be of some
size, or fine comminuted splinters of either table, often at as great a distance as 2 inches
or more from the surface. The cavity must be thoroughly explored and all splinters removed.
I have seen more than fifty extracted in one case of open gutter fracture. The brain pulp and
clot should then be gently removed or washed away, and the wound closed without drainage. Fragments
of bone, as a rule, are better not replaced, but complete suture of the skin flap is always
advisable in view of the great importance of primary union, and the fact that a drainage opening
exists at the original wound of entry, and that the wound is readily re-opened to its whole
extent, should such a step be advisable.

The detection of fragments is easiest and most satisfactorily done with the finger, and in
all but simple punctures the opening should be large enough to allow thoroughly effective digital
exploration; the remarks already made as to the factors determining the size of fragments are
of interest in this connection. The determination of the amount of brain pulp which should
be removed is somewhat more difficult; one can only say that all that washes readily away should
be removed, and its place is usually taken up by blood.

Few fractures of the base are suitable for treatment; the only ones I saw were those of direct
fracture of the roof of the orbit or nose, produced by bullets passing across the orbits; here
the advisability of interference with the injured eye led to opening of the orbit, and sometimes
exposed the fracture. Some patients recovered, even when the damage had been sufficient to
cause escape of pulped brain into the orbit.

The after treatment simply consisted in keeping the patients as quiet as circumstances would
permit, and the administration of a fluid diet. In some cases recurring symptoms pointed to
the continued presence of bone fragments; these were usually indicated by signs of irritation,
or often of local inflammation, in the latter case infection taking the greater share in the
causation. Such cases needed secondary exploration, and the wonderful success of this operation,
even when the wound was evidently infected, was perhaps one of the most striking experiences
of the surgery in general.

I should add a word here as to the most satisfactory time for the performance of these operations;
as in all cases the earlier they could be undertaken the better, but in the head injuries the
advantages of early interference were more evident than in any other region. This depended
on the fact that, as in civil practice, the scalp is one of the most dangerous regions as far
as auto-infection of the wound is concerned, and one of the most difficult to cleanse, except
by thorough shaving. Beyond this the extreme simplicity of the operative procedure needed,
called for few precautions beyond those for asepsis, and very little armament in the way of
instruments, &c.

When on the march from Winberg to Heilbron with the Highland Brigade we had some five days'
continuous fighting, and on this occasion several perforating fractures of the skull were brought
in. The coldness of the nights at that time made evening operations an impossibility; hence
the operations on these men were performed at the first dressing station, in the open air,
at the side of the ambulance wagons, often during the progress of fighting around. Of several
cases so operated on, all healed by primary union without a bad symptom of any kind, except
one (see p. 249), in whom a very large entrance opening over the right cortical motor area
led down to an extensive destruction of the brain, complicated by a fracture of the base in
the middle fossa. This wound, from the first considered hopeless, became septic during the
four days' travelling in an ambulance wagon that was necessary, and the man died at the end
of fourteen days. As the whole cortical motor area was destroyed, death was, perhaps, the end
most to be desired; but the fight that this man made for recovery, and the fact that his death,
after all, was due to general infection and not to any local extension of the injury, very
strongly impressed me with the possibility of recovery, even in such extensive cases, if only
an aseptic condition can be maintained. I saw many other cases of the same nature, particularly
in men who, as a result of unfortunate circumstances, were necessarily left out on the field
for more than twenty-four hours. In some of these maggots were found in the wounds only thirty-six
hours after the infliction of the injury.

I have said nothing as to the treatment of the large primary herniæ cerebri in wounds of an
explosive nature, since these were rarely subjects suitable for operation; but in the instances
of minor severity they were treated as the other cases where the pulped brain lay mostly within
the skull.

In cases where the wounds were in the frontal or fronto-parietal regions, and hemiplegia existed,
the rapid improvement in the paralytic symptoms, after operation, was very marked, showing
that the signs were mainly, or entirely, due to 'radiation' injury. I am inclined to think
that temporary injury of this kind from vibratory disturbance and small parenchymatous hæmorrhages,
were far more often the cause of the paralysis than surface hæmorrhage, since the latter was
rarely found in large quantity. Large clots, however, no doubt growing in both size and firmness,
occasionally occupied the area of destroyed brain, and these sometimes manifestly exercised
pressure that was at once relieved by their evacuation.

In cases where inflammatory hernia cerebri developed, a secondary exploration was often indicated
for the removal of fragments of bone or the evacuation of pus, otherwise the condition was
best treated by dry dressings and gentle support.

Abscess of the brain was treated by simple evacuation and drainage by metal or rubber tubes:
the operations were always of extreme simplicity, since the abscess in every case I saw was
in the direct line of the wound track, and was readily opened by the insertion of a director
or blunt knife. The only trouble in the after treatment was that already referred to, of preventing
premature closure of the drainage opening.

I have made no special reference to the method of dressing, since it was of the ordinary routine
kind. The most important factor in success was the efficient primary disinfection of the scalp;
a piece of antiseptic gauze and some absorbent wool, efficiently secured, was all that was
needed later.

As usual the consideration of the treatment of cases in which the bullet was retained may be
considered last. Such accidents were distinctly rare. I operated in only one (No. 54, p. 260)
in whom the indications both for localisation and interference were obvious, since the bullet
had palpably fractured the bone, although it had not retained sufficient force to enable it
to leave the skull. In two other cases that I saw, in one the bullet was lodged in the zygomatic
fossa, in the second just below the mastoid process. The former patient died; the latter exhibited
symptoms indicative of injury to the occipital lobe (No. 68), and was successfully treated
by Mr. J. E. Ker. I never happened to see a case in which a retained bullet in the skull was
localised by the X rays, but such might have been possible in case No. 64, p. 275. In no case
is primary interference indicated, unless a fracture exists where the bullet has tried to escape,
or secondary symptoms develop pointing to irritation.

Under ordinary circumstances, moreover, the indications for removal of a bullet are not likely
to be sufficiently imperative to necessitate the operation being undertaken until the patient
can be placed under the best conditions that can be secured. This is the more advisable since
such operations need the infliction of an additional wound, require great delicacy, and may
be very prolonged in performance. The experience of civil practice has already sufficiently
proved the small amount of inconvenience likely to follow the retention of a bullet in the skull.

I may again mention the fact that in explorations for the removal of bone fragments, fragments
of lead, from breaking or setting up of the bullet, are sometimes found.

Taken as a whole, the operations on the head were extremely satisfactory from a technical point
of view; the large depressed pulsating cicatrix so often left was the chief defect observed.
The circumstances under which many of the operations had to be performed militated strongly,
however, against the successful replacement of separated bone fragments, which might have rendered
the defects less serious.

Secondary operations for traumatic epilepsy scarcely come within the scope of these experiences.
In case 73, p. 292, it is of interest to note the manner in which the cavity due to loss of
brain substance was filled up. No doubt a similar vicarious arachnoid space develops in all
cases in which a soft pulsating swelling fills an aperture in the bones of the skull.

WOUNDS OF THE HEAD NOT INVOLVING THE BRAIN

Mastoid process.--The most important wound of the cranium not already mentioned was that involving
the mastoid process and the bony capsule of the ear. Wounds of the mastoid process obtained
their chief interest in connection with paralysis of the seventh nerve. This nerve rarely or
never escaped, and, as far as my experience went, the facial paralysis was permanent (see cases
111-114, p. 355). I think the same prognosis holds good with regard to the deafness resulting
from these injuries, and it is difficult to believe, with our experience of the effect of vibration
on other nerve centres and organs, that the internal ear could ever escape permanent damage.

In a number of cases the tympanum itself, or the external auditory meatus, was directly implicated
in tracks; in these, also, loss of hearing was the rule.

Wounds of the pinna when produced by undeformed bullets were usually of the same slitlike nature
remarked in perforations of the cartilages of the nose, and healed with equal rapidity.

Wounds of the orbit.--Injuries to the orbit were very numerous and serious in their results,
both to the globe of the eye and the surrounding structures.

Anatomical lesions.--The wound tracks, with regard to the injuries produced, may be well classified
according to the direction they took; thus--vertical, transverse, and oblique.

Vertical wound tracks were on the whole the least serious, but this mainly from the fact of
limitation of the injury to one orbital cavity. They were usually produced by bullets passing
from above downwards through the frontal region of the cranium, and were received by the patients
while in the prone position.

Transverse and oblique wounds owed their greater importance to the fact that both eyes were
more likely to be implicated.

Besides these tracks, which actually crossed the cavities, a number involved the bony boundaries,
producing almost as severe lesions in the globe of the eye, many of the patients being rendered
permanently blind. The only difference in nature of such cases was the escape of orbital structures,
and this was of minor importance in the presence of the graver lesion to vision. The following
is an illustrative case:--

     (74) Wounded at Colenso. Entry (Mauser), 1 inch below the
     centre of the margin of the right orbit; exit, behind the
     right angle of the mandible. Fracture of lower jaw, and
     development of a diffuse traumatic aneurism of the external
     carotid artery. The common carotid artery was tied for
     secondary hæmorrhage (Mr. Jameson) some three weeks later.

     Vision was affected at the time of the accident; the fingers
     could be seen, but not counted. After ligation of the carotid
     the condition was possibly worse, and this needs mention as
     transitory loss of power in the left upper extremity also
     followed the operation.

Fractures of the bony wall were of every degree. The most severe that I saw were two in which
lateral impact by a bullet crossing the cranial cavity caused general comminution of the whole
orbital roof. Fissures of the roof were common in connection with 'explosive' exit apertures
in the frontal region of the skull. Pure perforations usually accompanied the vertical or transverse
wounds of the cavity, fragments at the aperture of entry then being projected into the orbit,
sometimes penetrating the muscles.

Occasionally the margin of the cavity was merely notched.

The ocular muscles were often divided more or less completely, and occasionally some difficulty
arose in determining whether loss of movement of the globe in any definite direction depended
on injury to the muscle itself, or to the nerve supplying the muscle. The following case illustrates
this point:--

     (75) Entry (Mauser), 2 inches behind the right external
     canthus; the bullet pierced the external wall and traversed the
     floor of the right orbit beneath the globe, crossed the nasal
     cavity, and a part of the left orbit; exit, at the lower
     margin of the left orbit, beneath the centre of the globe of
     the eye.

     Complete loss of sight followed the injury, and persisted for
     one week. Modified vision then returned.

     Three weeks later there was diplopia; loss of function of the
     right external and inferior recti, although the ball could be
     turned downward to some extent by the superior oblique when the
     internal rectus was in action. Movements of the left globe were
     not seriously affected.

     The pupils were immobile and moderately dilated, but atropine
     had been employed two days previously.

     A year later the condition was as follows: There is some
     weakness of the right seventh nerve, as evidenced by want of
     symmetry in all the folds of the face, and in narrowing of the
     palpebral fissure.

     When at rest the right eye is somewhat raised and turned
     outwards. Active movements outwards or downwards are
     restricted. There is diplopia, and the vision of the right eye
     is much impaired; the man can see persons, but cannot count
     fingers with certainty, although he sees the hand. Putting on
     one side the loss of free movement, there is no obvious
     external appearance of injury to the eye.

Mr. J. H. Fisher reported as follows:

     Ophthalmoscopic examination shows the left eye and fundus to be
     normal. The right disc is not atrophied, but the whole of the
     lower half of the fundus is coated with masses of black retinal
     pigment. There is atrophy in spots of the capillary layer of
     the choroid, and the larger vessels of the deeper layer are
     exposed between the interstices of the pigment masses. There is
     no definite choroidal rupture. The lesion encroaches upon and
     implicates the macular region.

     The injury is a concussion one, not necessarily resulting from
     contact, and certainly not due to a perforation. The loss of
     movement and faulty position are the result of injury to the
     muscles, and not to nerve implication.

     The man complained that when he blew his nose the left eye
     filled with water and air came out. The left nasal duct was
     however shown to be intact, as water injected by the
     canaliculus passed freely into the nose.

Intra-orbital bleeding, subconjunctival hæmorrhage with proptosis and ecchymosis of the lids
were usually well marked. The latter was sometimes extreme.

Injury to the nerves was naturally of a very mixed character. In many instances the branches
of the first two divisions of the fifth nerve were obviously implicated and regional anæsthesia
was common. This was often transitory when the result of vibratory concussion, contusion, or
pressure from hæmorrhage. In other cases it was more prolonged as a result of actual division
of the nerve. As is usually the case, when a small area of distribution only was affected,
sensation was rapidly regained from vicarious sources, even when section had been complete.

As individual injuries, those to the optic nerve were the most frequently diagnosed. I am sorry
to be unable to attempt a discrimination of injuries to the nerve alone from those in which
both nerve and globe suffered, but the globe can rarely have escaped injury, either direct
or indirect, when the bullet actually traversed the orbital cavity. (A few further remarks
concerning injuries to the optic nerve will be found in Chapter IX.)

Injuries to the globe of the eye, either direct or indirect, accompanied most of the orbital
wounds.

In some the lesion was of the nature of concussion. In such the bone injury was usually at
the periphery of the orbit, or to the bones of the face in the neighbourhood. The loss of vision
might then be temporary, persisting from two to ten days, then returning, often with some deficiencies.

In other similar external injuries, the lesion of the globe was more severe, and permanent
blindness followed.

In variability of degree of completeness, these lesions of the globe corresponded exactly with
those produced in other parts of the nervous system by bullets striking the bones in their
vicinity, and they were no doubt the result of a similar transmission of vibratory force.

In a third series of cases the globe suffered direct contusion, and in a fourth was perforated
and destroyed.

In cases in which permanent blindness was produced without solution of continuity of the sclerotic
coat, the nature of the lesion was probably in most cases vibratory concussion and the development
of multiple hæmorrhages from choroidal ruptures of a similar nature to those seen in the brain
and spinal cord. The actual hæmorrhagic areæ varied in size; but, as far as my experience went,
gross hæmorrhages into the anterior chamber did not occur without severe direct contact of
the bullet.

In the vast majority of the cases blindness, whether transitory or permanent, developed immediately
on the reception of the injury, and was possibly in its initial stage the result of primary
concussion.

Cases were, however, seen occasionally in which the symptoms were less sudden, of which the
following is an example. I did not think that the mode of progress seen here could be referred
to simple orbital hæmorrhage, although this existed, but rather to intravaginal hæmorrhage
into the sheath of the optic nerve. On external inspection the globes appeared normal.

     (76) Wounded at Paardeberg. Entry (Mauser), over the centre
     of the right zygoma; the bullet traversed the right orbit,
     nose, and left orbit. Exit, immediately above the outer
     extremity of the left eyebrow.

     The patient stated that he could 'see' for thirty minutes with
     the right eye and for an hour with the left, immediately after
     the injury. He then became totally blind, and has since
     remained so. During the next three weeks there were occasional
     'flashes of light' experienced, but these then ceased.

     At the end of three weeks the condition was as follows: Ocular
     movements good in every direction except that of elevation of
     the globe. The levator palpebræ superioris acted very slightly;
     the right, however, better than the left.

     There were marked right proptosis, less left proptosis, and
     slight patchy subconjunctival hæmorrhage of both eyes. The
     pupils were dilated, motionless, and not concentric.

     The patient was invalided as totally blind (November, 1900).

Mr. Lang, who saw this patient on his return to England, kindly furnishes me with the following
note as to the condition. There was extensive damage to both eyes, hæmorrhage, and probably
retinal detachment as well as choroidal changes.

The quotation of a few illustrative examples typical of the ordinary orbital injuries may be
of interest:--

     (77) Vertical wound.--Entry, into left orbit in roof
     posterior to globe, and internal to optic nerve; exit, from
     orbit through junction of inner wall and floor into nose.

     Complete blindness followed the injury, but upon the second day
     light was perceived on lifting the upper lid. There was marked
     proptosis, subconjunctival ecchymosis, swelling and ecchymosis
     of the upper lid, and ptosis. Anæsthesia in the whole area of
     distribution of the frontal nerve.

     At the end of three weeks, fingers could be recognised, but a
     large blind spot existed in the centre of the field of vision.
     The general movements of the globe were fair, but the upper lid
     could not be raised. The proptosis and subconjunctival
     hæmorrhage cleared up.

     Little further improvement occurred; six months later the
     patient could only count the fingers excentrically. A very
     extensive scotoma was present. The optic disc was much
     atrophied, the calibre of the arteries diminished and the veins
     full (Mr. Critchett). The ptosis persisted. It was doubtful in
     this case whether the ptosis depended on injury to the nerve of
     supply, or on laceration and fixation of the levator palpebræ
     superioris. The latter seemed the more probable, as the
     superior rectus acted. The absence of any sign of gross
     bleeding into the anterior chamber is opposed to the existence
     of a perforating lesion of the globe in this case.

     (78) Entry (Mauser), from cranial cavity, just within the
     centre of the roof of the right orbit; exit, from the orbit
     by a notch in the lower orbital margin internal to the
     infra-orbital foramen; track thence beneath the soft parts of
     the face to emerge from the margin of the upper lip near the
     left angle of the mouth. Collapse of globe, proptosis,
     subconjunctival hæmorrhage, oedema and ecchymosis of lids.

     Shrunken ball removed on twenty-fourth day (Major Burton,
     R.A.M.C.).

     (79) Entry (Mauser), at the posterior border of the left
     mastoid process, 3/4 inch above the tip; exit, in the inner
     third of the left upper eyelid. Globe excised at end of seven
     days. Facial paralysis and deafness. Total
     blindness. Movements of ball good, no loss of tension.
     Proptosis, subconjunctival hæmorrhage, ecchymosis of eyelids.
     No improvement in sight followed. One month later the globe
     suppurated and was removed. The bullet had divided the optic
     nerve and contused the ball.

Prognosis and treatment of wounds of the orbit.--Except in those cases in which return of vision
was rapid, the prognosis was consistently bad in the injuries to the globe. When the globe
was ruptured it, as a rule, rapidly shrank. The case (80) quoted above is the only one in which
I saw secondary suppuration.

With regard to active treatment, the majority of the cases were complicated by fracture of
the roof of the orbit, and in many instances concurrent brain injury was present. In all of
these, as a general rule, it was advisable to await the closure of the wound in the orbital
roof prior to removal of the injured eye, if that was considered necessary. The only exception
to this rule was offered by instances in which the bullet passed from the orbit into the cranium;
in these primary removal of fragments projecting into the frontal lobe was preferable. As already
indicated, such wounds were comparatively rare except in the case of bullets coursing transversely
or obliquely.

The wounds were, as a rule, followed by considerable matting of the orbital structures.

Wounds of the nose.--I will pass by the external parts, with the remark that perforating wounds
of the cartilages were remarkable for their sharp limitation and simple nature. I remember
one case shown to me in the Irish Hospital in Bloemfontein by Sir W. Thomson, in which at the
end of the third day small symmetrical vertical slits in each ala already healed were scarcely
visible. This case very strongly impressed one with the doctrine of chances, since on the same
morning I was asked to see a patient in whom a similar transverse shot had crossed both orbits,
destroying both globes and injuring the brain.

A retained bullet in the upper portion of the nasal cavity has already been referred to (fig.
60). This accident was naturally a rare one; in that instance the bullet had only retained
sufficient force to insert itself neatly between the bones.

Wounds crossing the nasal fossæ were comparatively common. The interference with the sense
of smell often resulting is discussed in Chapter IX.

Wounds of the malar bone were not infrequent. The small amount of splintering was somewhat
remarkable considering the density of structure of the bone. In this particular the behaviour
of the malar corresponded with what was observed in the flat bones in general. A case quoted
in Chapter III. p. 87, illustrates the capacity of the hard edge of the bone to check the course
of a bullet, and cause considerable deformity and fissuring of the mantle.

Wounds of the jaws. Upper jaw.--A large number of tracks crossing the antrum transversely,
obliquely, or vertically were observed. In the first case the nasal cavity, in the others the
orbital or buccal cavity, were generally concurrently involved. It was somewhat striking that
I never observed any trouble, immediate or remote, from these perforations of the antrum. If
hæmorrhage into the cavity occurred, it gave rise to no ultimate trouble. I never saw an instance
of secondary suppuration even in cases where the bullet entered or escaped through the alveolar
process with considerable local comminution. The branches of the second division of the fifth
nerve were sometimes implicated. In one instance a bullet traversed and cut away a longitudinal
groove in the bones, extending from the posterior margin of the hard palate, and terminating
by a wide notch in the alveolar process.

A good example of a troublesome transverse wound of the bones of the face is afforded by the
following instance:--

     (81) Entry (Mauser), through the left malar eminence, 1 inch
     below and external to the external canthus; exit, a slightly
     curved tranverse slit in the lobe of the right ear.

     The injury was followed by no signs of orbital concussion, and
     no loss of consciousness. There was free bleeding from both
     external wounds and from the nose. The sense of smell was
     unaffected, but taste was impaired, and there was loss of
     tactile sensation in the teeth on the left side also on the
     hard palate. There was no evidence of fracture of the neck of
     the mandible, nor of the external auditory meatus, but there
     was considerable difficulty in opening the mouth widely or
     protruding the teeth. The latter difficulty persisted for some
     time, and was still present when I last saw the patient.

Mandible.--Fractures of the lower jaw were frequent and offered some peculiarities, the chief
of which were the liability of any part of the bone to be damaged, and the absence of the obliquity
between the cleft in the outer and inner tables so common in the fractures seen in civil practice.

The neck of the condyle I three times saw fractured; in each instance permanent stiffness and
inability to open the mouth resulted. This stiffness was of a degree sufficient to raise the
question whether the best course in such cases would not be to cut down primarily and remove
a considerable number of loose fragments, and thus diminish the amount of callus likely to
be thrown out.

Fractures of the ascending ramus and body were more frequent. They were accompanied by considerable
comminution, but all that I observed healed remarkably well, and in good position, in spite
of the fact that many of the patients objected to wear any form of splint.

The most special feature was the occurrence of notched fractures, corresponding to the type
wedges described in Chapter V. When these fractures were at the lower margin of the bone, the
buccal cavity occasionally escaped in spite of considerable comminution, the latter confining
itself to the basal portion of the bone.

When the base of the teeth, or the alveolus, was struck, a wedge was often broken away, and
from the apex of the resulting gap a fracture extended to the lower margin of the bone.

When fractures of the latter nature resulted from vertically coursing bullets, much trouble
often ensued. I will quote two cases in illustration:--

     (82) Wounded at Rooipoort. Entry (Mauser), through the lower
     lip; the bullet struck the base of the right lateral incisor
     and canine teeth, knocked out a wedge, and becoming slightly
     deflected, cut a vertical groove to the base of the mandible;
     exit, in left submaxillary triangle. The bullet subsequently
     re-entered the chest wall just below the clavicle, and escaped
     at the anterior axillary fold. The appearance of these second
     wounds suggested only slight setting up of the bullet; the
     original impact was no doubt of an oblique or lateral
     character.

     The injury was followed by free hæmorrhage and remarkably
     abundant salivation (I was inclined to think that the latter
     symptom was particularly well marked in gunshot fractures of
     the body of the mandible), and very great swelling of the floor
     of the mouth.

     The patient could not bear any form of apparatus, but was
     assiduous in washing out his mouth, and made a good recovery,
     the fragments being in good apposition.

     (83) Entry (Mauser), over the right malar eminence; the
     bullet carried away all the right upper and lower molars,
     fractured the mandible, and was retained in the neck.

     A fortnight later an abscess formed in the lower part of the
     neck, which was opened (Mr. Pooley), and portions of the mantle
     and leaden core, together with numerous fragments of the teeth,
     were removed. The bullet had undergone fragmentation on impact,
     probably on the last one (teeth of mandible), and still
     retained sufficient force to enter the neck.

This case affords an interesting example of transmission of force from the bullet to the teeth,
and bears on the theory of explosive action.

In the treatment of fractures of the upper jaw, interference was rarely needed. In the case
of the mandible, a remark has already been made as to the advisability of removing fragments
when the neck of the condyle has suffered comminution. The removal of loose fragments is necessary
in all cases in which the buccal cavity is involved. Experience in fracture of the limbs has
shown a tendency to quiet necrosis when comminution was severe, in spite of primary union.
This is no doubt dependent on the very free separation of fragments on the entry and exit aspects
from their enveloping periosteum. In the case of the mandible, considerable necrosis is inevitable,
and much time is saved by the primary removal of all actually loose fragments.

A splint of the ordinary chin-cap type with a four-tailed bandage meets all further requirements,
but the patients often object to them. Cases in which the fragments could be fixed by wiring
the teeth were not common, as the latter had so frequently been carried away. The usual precautions
as to maintaining oral asepsis were especially necessary.

The results of fractures of the mandible were, in so far as my experience went, remarkably
good, as deformity was seldom considerable. The absence of obliquity and the effect of primary
local shock were no doubt favourable elements, little primary displacement from muscular action
occurring.

Wounds of the cheek healed readily, and the same was noticeable of the lips. Wounds of the
tongue healed with remarkable rapidity when of the simple perforating type, often with little
or no swelling or evidence of contusion. At the end of a few days it was often difficult to
localise them.

In connection with this subject a remarkable case which occurred at the fighting at Koodoosberg
Drift is worthy of mention, although the projectile was a shell fragment and not a bullet of
small calibre.

     (84) A Highlander was the unfortunate possessor of an entire
     set of upper teeth set in a gold plate. A small fragment of a
     shell perforated the upper lip by an irregular aperture, and
     struck the teeth in such a manner as to turn the posterior edge
     of the plate towards the tongue, which latter was cut into two
     halves transversely through to the base.

     The patient asserted that the plate had been driven down his
     throat, but nothing was palpable either in the fauces or on
     external examination of the neck. He spoke distinctly, but
     there was dysphagia as far as solids were concerned.

     On the second day swelling of the neck due to early cellulitis
     developed, especially on the left side, and signs of laryngeal
     obstruction became prominent. Chloroform was administered, but
     on the introduction of the finger into the fauces, respiration
     failed and a hasty tracheotomy had to be performed. No foreign
     body was palpable with the finger in the pharynx.

     Tracheitis and septic pneumonia developed, and the man died of
     acute septicæmia thirty-six hours later. Death occurred just as
     the Division received marching orders, and no post-mortem
     examination was made. As a result of palpation at the time of
     the tracheotomy, the probabilities seemed against the presence
     of the tooth plate in the pharynx, but the absence of positive
     evidence scarcely allows the case to be certainly classed as
     one of cellulitis and septicæmia secondary to wound of the
     tongue.

WOUNDS OF THE NECK

Wounds of the neck were not unfrequent and were of the gravest importance; there can be little
doubt that they accounted for a considerable proportion of the deaths on the field. On the
other hand, the neck as a region offered some of the most striking examples of hairbreadth
escape of important structures. Consideration of a number of the vascular lesions (see cervical
aneurisms, p. 135) also shows conclusively that in no region did the small size of the bullet
more materially influence the result, since no doubt can exist that all these wounds would
have proved immediately fatal if produced by projectiles of larger calibre.

In this place only a few general considerations will be entered into, as most of the important
cases are dealt with under the general headings of vessels, nerves, and spine; but it is convenient
to include here the few remarks that have to be made concerning the cervical viscera.

The wounds of the soft parts might course in any direction, but vertical tracks from above
downwards were rare. In point of fact, these occurred only in connection with perforations
of the head, and as vertical wounds of the latter were received in the prone position, usually
when the head was raised, the necessary conditions for longitudinal tracks were seldom offered.
One case of a complete vertical track in the muscles of the back of the neck has been already
quoted (No. 69, p. 286).

Tracks coursing upwards from the trunk were somewhat more frequent in occurrence; thus a considerable
number traversing the thorax were seen. In such instances the aperture of exit was generally
situated in the posterior triangle, and some of the brachial nerves often suffered.

The commonest forms of wound were the transverse or the oblique. A large number of cases with
such tracks will be found among the cases of injury to the cervical vessels and nerves. In
some instances the course was restricted to the neck alone, in others the trunk or upper extremity
was also implicated.

The favourable influence of the arrangement of the structures of the neck, which allows of
the ordinary displacement excursions necessary for deglutition, respiration, and their cognate
movements, was very strongly marked. Thus in several cases the bullet traversed the neck behind
the pharynx and oesophagus without injuring either viscus, and the escape of the main vessels
and nerves was equally striking. In such wounds the wedge-like bullet without doubt separated
and displaced all these structures, causing mere superficial contusion.

In connection with the latter statement, the rarity of direct sagittal wounds in the hospitals
should be mentioned. This is probably to be explained by the facts that wounds in the mid-line
of the neck implicated the cervical spinal cord, and that sagittal wounds implicating the vessels
were apt to lead more directly to the surface, and thus external hæmorrhage was favoured. A
few examples of cervical tracks will suffice to illustrate these remarks:--

     (85) Entry (Lee-Metford), below angle of scapula; exit,
     centre of posterior triangle. Injury to the lung, and
     hæmothorax. No damage to neck structures.

     (86) Entry (Mauser), over Pomum Adami; exit, below right
     scapular spine. Median and musculo-spiral paralysis.

     (87) Entry, a large oval aperture through ninth right rib,
     1/2 an inch external to scapular angle; exit, anterior border
     of sterno-mastoid opposite Pomum Adami. Second entry, opposite
     angle of mandible; exit, in centre of cheek.

     Wound of lung. Musculo-spiral paralysis still persisting at the
     end of nine months.

     (88) Entry (Mauser), 2 inches above left clavicle at margin
     of trapezius; exit, 1 inch from sternum in left first
     intercostal space. Contusion of brachial plexus, with mixed
     signs, which disappeared in two months. No signs of vascular
     injury.

See also cases of cervical aneurism, &c.

Wounds of the pharynx.--I saw only three cases of wound of the pharynx; in each the injury
was in the nasal or buccal segment of the cavity, and in each the soft palate was injured,
in two instances the wound being a small perforation.

All three cases belong to the somewhat miraculous class. The first (89) was the only one in
which the wound gave rise to subsequent trouble. The second was under the charge of Mr. Bowlby,
and will no doubt be more fully recounted by him, as interesting signs of injury to the cervical
cord were present. In the third the occipital neuralgia was the only troublesome symptom.

In both cases 90 and 91 the high position of the wound in the fixed portion of the pharynx
no doubt accounted for the absence of any infective trouble.

     (89) Wounds of the pharynx.--Entry (Lee-Metford),
     immediately below the tip of right mastoid process; the bullet
     traversed the neck, entering the pharynx close to the right
     tonsil, crossed the cavity of the pharynx and the mouth,
     emerging through the left cheek. Great swelling of the fauces
     and dysphagia persisted for some days after the injury, and
     there was considerable hæmorrhage.

     Infection of the posterior portion of the track from the
     pharynx resulted, and suppuration continued for some weeks: a
     small sequestrum eventually needed to be removed from the tip
     of the transverse process of the atlas.

     (90) Entry (Mauser), through mouth; the bullet pierced the
     soft palate and the posterior wall of the pharynx, and passed
     out between the transverse process of atlas and the occiput. No
     serious pharyngeal symptoms.

     (91) Entry (Mauser), through the mouth, knocking out the left
     upper canine and bicuspid teeth. Perforation of the soft palate
     just to the right of the base of the uvula and the posterior
     wall of the pharynx; exit, 1-1/2 inch internal to and 1/2 an
     inch below the tip of the right mastoid process. Hæmorrhage
     persisted for half an hour, and the patient could not swallow
     solids for a week. Great occipital neuralgia followed the
     wound.

Wounds of the larynx.--I saw only one wound of the larynx (see No. 10, p. 135). In this instance
the thyroid cartilage was wounded on either side at the level of the Pomum Adami. Transitory
hæmorrhage and signs of oedema were the only signs referable to the wound, but in addition
the bullet contused the left vagus and gave rise to temporary laryngeal paralysis. The same
course was observed in a second case of perforation of the larynx of which I was told.

Wounds of the trachea.--The two cases recounted below are the only tracheal injuries I met
with; in one the oesophagus was also implicated. This patient died from mediastinal emphysema.
In the second case the wide development of emphysema was prevented by the early introduction
of a tracheotomy tube.

     (92) Entry (Mauser), on the outer side of the right arm,
     3-1/2 inches below the acromion; exit, 3 inches below the tip
     of the left mastoid process, through the sterno-mastoid. Thirty
     six hours later there was very free hæmorrhage into the right
     posterior triangle, emphysema at the episternal notch,
     dysphagia, and complete obliteration of the cardiac area of
     dulness. Respiration was rapid (40) and extremely noisy. Pulse
     130, small and weak.

     A tracheotomy was performed (Mr. Stewart), but the patient died
     an hour later. When the operation was performed a considerable
     amount of mucus from the oesophagus was discovered in the
     wound. The bullet had passed obliquely between trachea and
     oesophagus, wounding both tubes.

     (93) Entry, at the centre of the margin of the left
     trapezius; exit, in mid line of the neck over the trachea.
     Dyspnoea was noted the next morning, which increased during a
     journey in a wagon. On the third day the dyspnoea was more
     troublesome and emphysema began to develop in the neck. A
     tracheotomy was performed (Mr. Hunter), and the tube was kept
     in for four days. No further trouble was experienced, and the
     wound shortly closed, and the patient, a surgeon, returned to
     his duties. Temporary signs of median nerve concussion and
     contusion were noted.

CHAPTER VIII

INJURIES TO THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN AND SPINAL CORD

Every degree of local injury to the constituent vertebræ and the contents of the spinal canal
was met with considerable frequency. Pure uncomplicated fractures of the bones were of minor
importance, except in so far as they exemplified the general tendency to localised injury in
small-calibre bullet wounds. Injuries implicating the spinal medulla, on the other hand, were
proportionately the most fatal of any in the whole body to the wounded who left the field of
battle or Field hospital alive, and these cases formed one of the most painful and distressing
features of the surgery of the campaign.

The prognostic gravity of any spinal injury depended upon two factors: first, the obvious one
of relative contiguity or direct implication of the cord or nerves in the wound track; secondly,
the degree of velocity retained by the bullet at the moment of impact with the spine. Observation
of the serious ill effects produced by bullets passing in the immediate proximity of large
strongly ensheathed peripheral nerves surrounded by soft tissue, such as those of the arm or
thigh, would lead one to expect that a comparatively thin-clad bundle of delicate nerve tissue
like the spinal cord, enclosed in a bony canal so well disposed for the conveyance of vibrations,
would suffer severely, and such proved to be the case.

Fractures in their relation to nerve injury will be first dealt with, and secondly injuries
to the cord itself.

Isolated fractures of the processes were not uncommon, the determination of the injury to anyone
being naturally dependent on the position and direction taken by the wound track.

For implication of the transverse processes sagittal wounds coursing in varying degrees of
obliquity were mainly responsible. Such injuries might be unaccompanied by any nerve lesion.
Thus a Boer received a Lee-Metford wound at Belmont which passed from just below the tip of
the right mastoid process across the pharynx and through the opposite cheek. No bone damage
was at first suspected; suppuration in the neck, however, followed infection from the pharynx,
and when a sinus which persisted was opened up later, a number of small comminuted fragments
were found detached from the transverse process of the axis. In other cases more or less severe
symptoms of nerve lesion were observed, varying from transient hyperæsthesia, due to implication
of the issuing nerves, to symptoms of spinal hæmorrhage, such as are portrayed in the following:--

     (94) A private in the Black Watch was wounded at Magersfontein
     from within a distance of 1,000 yards. Among other wounds, one
     track entered 1 inch to the right of the second lumbar spinous
     process, and emerged 1 inch internal to the right anterior
     superior iliac spine. There were signs of wound of the kidney,
     and in addition, retention of urine, incontinence of fæces,
     complete motor and sensory paralysis of the right lower
     extremity, and total absence of all reflexes. Anæsthesia
     existed over the whole area of skin supplied by the nerves of
     the sacral plexus, hyperæsthesia over that supplied by the
     lumbar nerves.

     On the tenth day subsequent to the injury, the hyperæsthesia in
     the area of lumbar supply was replaced by normal sensation,
     motor power began to be slowly regained in the muscles supplied
     by the anterior crural and obturator nerves, and the patellar
     reflex returned. At this time lowered sensation returned in the
     area supplied by the sacral plexus, but no improvement in motor
     power took place, and no control was regained over the bladder
     and rectum.

     During the succeeding week some sciatic hyperæsthesia
     developed, but on the twenty-eighth day the patient developed
     secondary peritonitis from other causes and died on the
     thirty-first. A fracture of the transverse process existed, but
     unfortunately the spinal canal was not opened for examination
     and no details can be given as to the condition of the cord.
     (See case 201, p. 463.)

Fractures of the spinous processes, or those involving both the process and laminæ, were not
uncommon. Isolated separation of the spinous process was usually the result of wounds crossing
the back obliquely or transversely. Examples of this injury were numerous, especially in the
dorsal region, as being the most prominent, particularly when the patients assumed the prone
position when advancing on the enemy.

Cervical injuries, owing to the comparatively sheltered position of the more deeply sunk spines,
and from the fact that the head was usually under cover of a stone or ant-heap, were less common;
in one instance hyperæsthesia was noted in one upper extremity as the result of a crossing
bullet having struck the fourth cervical spine. In a man wounded at Paardeberg Drift the bullet
entered at the centre of the buttock, traversed the bones of the pelvis, and, leaving that
cavity above the crest of the ilium, crossed the spine to emerge in the opposite loin. Suppuration
occurred, and when the wound was laid open the third and fourth lumbar spinous processes were
found to be loosened, but still connected to the surrounding soft parts. There were no nerve
symptoms in this case; these would not have been expected, since by the time that the bullet
had traversed the bones of the pelvis its velocity must have been considerably lessened, even
if high at the moment of primary impact. In another case a dorsal spine, together with its
lamina, was separated and moveable; the only nerve symptoms were slight pain and a crop of
herpes on the line of distribution of the corresponding intercostal nerve, the bullet having
probably struck the nerve in passing across the intercostal space. In one instance of a retained
bullet lying beneath the skin of the back, its passage between two contiguous dorsal spines
without fracture of either was determined during an extraction operation.

When the prone position was assumed by the men, more or less longitudinal wounds in the course
of the spine were naturally liable to occur. These tracks assumed somewhat greater importance
than the transverse ones, because the injury to bone was more often multiple, and the laminæ
were frequently implicated. The relative importance of such injuries was dependent on the velocity
of the bullet and the depth at which it travelled. As an instance of a more serious character
the following may be given:--

     (95) In a Highlander wounded at Magersfontein, probably at a
     range within 1,000 yards, the bullet entered at the right side
     of the sixth cervical vertebra; tracking downwards, it loosened
     the laminæ of the fifth and sixth dorsal vertebræ from the
     pedicles, and separated the tip of the seventh spine. The
     bullet was extracted from beneath the skin at the latter spot,
     its force having been no doubt exhausted by the resistance of
     the firm neural arches supported by the weight of the man's
     body. Symptoms of total transverse lesion of the cord followed,
     and the patient died at the end of fifty-four days. The bone
     had not apparently been sufficiently depressed to exert
     continuous pressure, but the cord was diffluent and actually
     destroyed over an area corresponding with the fourth, fifth,
     sixth, and seventh dorsal segments.

I saw no instance of wound of the neural arch from a direct shot in the back in any of our
men, neither was I ever able to detect an injury to the articular processes as a localised lesion.

Injuries to the centra were very frequent, but differed extraordinarily in their importance.
Perforation by bullets travelling at a relatively low grade of velocity, but still one sufficient
to allow them to pass through the body, produced in many instances no symptoms whatever when
the track did not lie in immediate contiguity to the spinal canal or perforate it.

In all the wounds which I had the opportunity of examining post mortem, the fracture was of
the nature of a pure perforation of the cancellous tissue of the centrum, with no comminution
beyond slight splintering of the compact tissue at the aperture of exit. In one instance the
bullet passed in a coronal direction so close to the back of the centrum as to leave a septum
of only the thickness of stout paper between the track and the spinal canal. In this case signs
of total transverse lesion were present. I never happened to meet with a case in which the
canal was encroached upon from the front by displaced bone. In some cases at the end of six
weeks there was difficulty in determining the position of the openings, and section of the
bone was necessary in order to assure oneself as to the direction of the track.

In some instances the centra were pierced in the coronal direction with varying degrees of
obliquity; in others the direction was more sagittal; in two of the latter the bullet was retained
in the spinal canal. The tracks were sometimes confined to one vertebra, but often implicated
two. In others the bullet passed longitudinally through the thorax, grooving or perforating
one or more centra.

The accompanying evidences of nerve injury varied from nil to those of pressure or irritation
of the nerve roots, transient signs of spinal concussion, signs of contusion and hæmorrhage,
or to evidence of total transverse lesion. Instances of all these conditions will be quoted
under the heading of injuries to the cord or nerves.

Signs of injury to the vertebræ.--Separation of the spinous processes was often indicated by
slight deformity, either evident or palpable, local pain, tenderness, mobility, and crepitus.
In some cases these local signs were reinforced by evidence of cord injury. Fractures involving
the laminæ differed merely in the degree to which the above signs were developed. Fractures
of the transverse processes were generally only to be assumed from the position and direction
of the wounds, the assumption being sometimes strengthened in probability by evidence of injury
to the cord and nerves.

Fractures of the centra were also frequently only to be assumed from the direction of the wound
tracks, and possibly from evidence of nerve injury. When no paralysis supervened, interference
with the movements of the back, or pain, was so slight as to be inappreciable, especially in
the presence of concurrent injury to other parts, which was seldom absent. I only once saw
any angular deformity from this injury, and that slight, and not apparent before the end of
three weeks. In this particular a very striking difference exists between injuries from small-calibre
bullets and larger ones such as the Martini-Henry. In the only instance of Martini-Henry fracture
of the spine that came under my notice, the centrum was severely comminuted and deformity was
obvious. Still, as in so many particulars, the difference was only one of degree, since comminution
of the centra in gunshot wounds has always been observed to be slight in nature compared with
what is met with in the compression fractures of civil life.

A few words will suffice to dismiss the questions of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of
the above injuries. The diagnosis depended on attention to the signs above indicated, the prognosis
almost entirely on the concurrent injury to the nervous system, which will be considered later,
and the treatment consisted in enforcing rest alone.

INJURIES TO THE SPINAL CORD ACCOMPANYING SMALL-CALIBRE BULLET WOUNDS OF THE VERTEBRÆ

Anatomical lesions.--In introducing the subject of the nature of the lesions of the spinal
cord and membranes, I should again enforce the statement that their character and degree, in
comparison with the slight accompanying bone damage, are pathognomonic of gunshot wounds, and
that these characters find their completest exemplification in injuries produced by bullets
of small calibre, endowed with a high grade of velocity. Again, that the varying degrees of
damage depend comparatively slightly on the position of the bone lesion, apart from actual
encroachment on the canal, while the degree of velocity retained by the bullet at the moment
of impact is all-important. In no other way are the divergent results to be explained which
follow an apparently identical injury, in so far as extent, position, and external evidence
of damage to the spinal column are concerned.

Injuries to the nerve roots of the nature of concussion and contusion, are dealt with in Chapter
IX.

Pure concussion of the spinal cord may, I believe, be studied from a better standpoint in the
case of small-calibre bullet injuries than in any others, since in many instances it is, I
think, possible to exclude any complications such as wrenches and strains of the vertebral
column, and ascribe the symptoms to the pure effect of extreme vibratory force communicated
to the cord by its enveloping bony canal. The condition must be considered under the two headings
of slight and severe.

In slight concussion the usually transient effects of the injury, and its happy tendency not
to destroy life, place us in a state of uncertainty as to the occurrence of anatomical changes,
since no opportunity of post-mortem examination occurred. The clinical condition included under
this term corresponds with that implied in 'spinal concussion' in civil practice. One point
of extreme interest, whether the subjects of small-calibre bullet spinal concussion will in
the future suffer from the remote effects common to similar sufferers in civil life from other
causes such as railway collisions, still remains for future determination. An ample field for
such observations has at any rate been created by the present war.

In severe concussion a far more highly destructive action is exerted. This condition may be
followed by complete disorganisation of the cord, accompanied or not by multiple parenchymatous
hæmorrhages into its substance. Either or both of these pathological conditions are produced
by the impact of the bullet with the spine, given a sufficiently high degree of velocity, and
it is difficult to separate clinically the resulting symptoms. This is a matter perhaps of
less importance, since it stands to reason that a vibratory force, capable of rupturing the
spinal capillaries, would at the same time damage the nervous tissue.

In speaking of concussion of this degree, it should be clearly recognised that a general condition,
such as is indicated by the use of the term 'concussion of the brain,' is in no wise implied.
The condition is really far more nearly allied to one of contusion, a strictly localised portion
of the spinal cord undergoing the destructive process which affects the segments below only
in so far as it interrupts the normal channels of communication with the higher centres.

Case 102 is an instance of such a lesion, the post-mortem examination showing clearly that
the spinal canal was not encroached upon by the bullet. The cord in this instance appeared
little changed macroscopically, and this fact was observed in other instances, both during
operations and post mortem.

Contusion.--This condition is very closely allied to the last. In cases 101 and 103 the spinal
canal was as little encroached upon as in 102, but the bullet struck the somewhat elastic neural
arch in each case, and post mortem an adhesion between the cord and the enveloping dura opposite
the point at which impact of the bullet was closest suggests that, in spite of the escape of
the bone from fracture, it may have been momentarily depressed to a sufficient degree to contuse
the cord, or the latter may have suffered a contre-coup injury. For these reasons the inclusion
of the cases as instances of pure concussion is not warranted. In both Nos. 99 and 100 the
neural arch had actually suffered fracture, and although the bone was not depressed or exercising
pressure at the time of the autopsies, it was no doubt driven in temporarily at the moment
of impact of the bullet.

At the post-mortem examinations of injuries of this nature it was common to find one to four
segments of the spinal cord completely disorganised. At the end of some five weeks, the common
duration of life, the structure of the cord was represented by a semi-diffluent yellowish material,
the consistence of which was so deficient in firmness as to allow the partial collapse of the
membranes covering the affected portion, so as to exhibit a definite narrowing when the whole
was held up (see fig. 79). In such cases traces of extra- or intra-dural hæmorrhage sometimes
still persisted.

Hæmorrhage.--This occurred as surface extravasation and in the form of parenchymatous hæmorrhages.
I saw the former both in the extra-dural and peri-pial forms, but never in sufficient quantity
to exert a degree of pressure calculated to produce symptoms of total transverse lesion. Here
again, however, it is difficult to speak with confidence since the conditions which regulate
the tension within the normal spinal canal are so complicated and liable to variation, that
it is very difficult to estimate the effect of any given hæmorrhage discovered.

My friend Mr. R. H. Mills-Roberts described to me one fatal case under his care in the Welsh
Hospital in which extra-dural hæmorrhage was so abundant as, in his opinion, to have taken
a prominent part in the production of the paralytic symptoms.

Examples of both extra- and intra-dural (peri-pial) hæmorrhage are afforded by cases 99, 102,
and 103; in none was it large in amount or widely distributed. The condition was probably also
frequently associated in varying degree with that to be immediately described below.

Intra-medullary hæmorrhage (hæmato-myelia).--The importance of this condition is lessened in
small-calibre bullet injuries by the fact already alluded to, that it is almost invariably
accompanied by concussion changes. In one instance in which death took place at the end of
eight days, partly as the result of concurrent injury, in a man in whom signs of total transverse
lesion of the cord were present, the substance of the cord was found to be closely scattered
over with hæmorrhages of various sizes and extending for a longitudinal area of some three inches.

As to the frequency with which hæmorrhage into the substance of the cord occurred, I regret
to be unable to give an opinion. In the late post-mortem examinations I witnessed, a yellow
discoloration of the softened cord was the only macroscopic evidence of hæmorrhage.

Hæmorrhages of this nature may, however, account for the grave paralytic symptoms in some cases
of partial or total transverse lesion not due to direct compression or laceration.

The conditions of concussion, contusion, or hæmatomyelia were, I believe, responsible for at
least nine-tenths of the cases in which a total transverse lesion was indicated by the symptoms.
The extreme importance of realising this fact and the rarity of the production of symptoms
by continuing compression both from the prognostic and the therapeutic point of view is obvious.

The analogous injuries termed generally in Chapter IX. nerve contusion, although frequently
accompanied by tissue destruction, may be followed by reparative change, and are capable of
complete or almost complete spontaneous recovery; while the lesions in the spinal cord are
permanent, and complete recovery is only witnessed in the parts affected by the remote pressure
or irritation from blood extravasation, or in those influenced by concussion.

I include below short abstracts of all the cases of lesion of the spinal cord which terminated
fatally, in which I had the opportunity of witnessing the post-mortem conditions. In a considerable
proportion of the cases at the end of six weeks the spinal cord was softened over an area of
from two to four segments in such degree as to have practically lost all continuity. Although
the autopsies were made on patients who had died slowly and in summer weather, often twelve
to sixteen hours after death, I think it can be but fair to assume, when the consistency of
the remaining portion of the spinal cord is considered, that the softening was only in slight
degree if at all exaggerated by post-mortem change. Again symptoms of secondary myelitis and
meningitis had been observed in some of the fatal cases prior to death.

I had but one opportunity of observing a case in which a retained bullet exercised compression,
and none in which this was due to displaced bone fragments. I also only once came across a
case of complete section, but no doubt both bone pressure and section may have occurred with
greater frequency amongst patients dying on the field or shortly after. The case of section
is illustrated in fig. 80. It will be noted that, although the section is complete, the bullet
lies to one side of the canal, and hence the bullet, as fixed in its course by the bone of
the centrum, directly struck but half of the whole width of the cord.

It was striking how little secondary change in the cord had occurred in the neighbourhood of
the spot of division. This well illustrates the comparatively slight vibratory effect of a
bullet travelling with a degree of velocity insufficient to completely perforate the vertebral
column.

Symptoms of injury to the spinal cord.--In slight spinal concussion these exactly resembled
those of the more severe lesions, except in their transitory nature. They consisted in loss
of cutaneous sensibility, motor paralysis, and vesical and rectal incompetence. The phenomena
persisted from periods of a few hours to two or three days, return of function being first
noticeable in the sensory nerves, and often with modification in the way of lowered acuteness,
or minor signs of irritation, such as formication, slight hyperæsthesia or pain, pointing to
a combination with the least extensive degrees of hæmorrhage; later, motor power was rapidly
regained. The subjects of such symptoms often suffered from weakness and unsteadiness in movement
for some days or weeks; a sharp line of discrimination between such cases and those described
in the next paragraphs is manifestly impossible.

Spinal hæmorrhage.--The symptoms of this condition developed differently according to whether
concurrent concussion existed. Occasionally very typical instances of pure hæmorrhage were
observed with transient symptoms:--

     (96) A private in the Yorkshire Light Infantry was wounded at
     Modder River; the bullet entered between the eleventh and
     twelfth ribs, just posterior to the left mid-axillary line,
     emerging in the posterior axillary fold, at its junction with
     the right side of the trunk. On the second day after the injury
     the lower extremities became drawn up, the knees and hips
     assuming a flexed position, and this was followed shortly by
     the advent of complete motor and sensory paraplegia,
     accompanied by retention of urine. Two days later, the patient
     again passed water normally, and gradual and rapid return of
     both sensation and motor power took place. At the end of
     fourteen days no trace of the condition remained, and the
     patient was shortly after sent home.

The symptoms, however, were rarely so simple as in this example; it was very much more common
to meet with an admixture of signs of primary concussion, or at any rate symptoms of radiation.
The following is an extreme but excellent example of more complicated and prolonged effects:

     (97) A lance-corporal of the Black Watch was wounded at
     Magersfontein at a range of from 400 to 500 yards. The bullet
     entered over the left malar bone 2-1/2 inches from the outer
     canthus, while the aperture of exit was 2-1/4 inches above the
     inferior angle of the right scapula, 3/4 of an inch anterior to
     its axillary margin.

     Very shortly after the injury complete motor and sensory
     paralysis developed in both upper extremities, followed by the
     development of a similar condition in the left lower limb, and
     retention of urine and fæces, but the latter unaccompanied by
     the marked abdominal intestinal distension so characteristic in
     cases of total transverse lesion. The right side of the chest
     continued to work well, but the intercostals of the left side
     were paralysed. No disturbance of the normal action or
     condition of the pupils was noted. After the first few days the
     condition began to improve.

     Three weeks later, the chest was moving symmetrically and well,
     sensation and motor power had returned in considerable degree
     in the left lower extremity, with marked increase in both the
     plantar and patellar reflexes; sensation had returned in both
     upper extremities, a slight amount of motor power was regained
     in the right, but the left remained entirely flaccid and
     incapable of movement.

     At the end of a month power was regained over both bladder and
     rectum, some slight movement of the left thumb was possible,
     and a certain degree of hyperæsthesia developed over the back
     of the forearm.

     At the end of six weeks there was little further alteration,
     but that in the direction of improvement. There was some
     wasting of the muscles of the left upper extremity, and this
     was most marked in the muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve.

     At the end of ten weeks the patient had been up some days; he
     could stand and walk, but was unable to rise from the sitting
     posture without help. The plantar and patellar reflexes were
     much exaggerated, and there was ankle clonus, most marked in
     the left limb. The right upper extremity was normal, but weak;
     there was wrist-drop on the left side and the deltoid was
     wasted and powerless; on the other hand the fingers could be
     flexed, and although the elbow could not be, there were signs
     of returning power in the biceps, and some movements of the
     shoulder could be performed by the capsular muscles. It was
     remarkable that common sensation was more acute in the left
     than the right lower extremity, but I attributed this to the
     remains of hyperæsthesia on the left side. The patient left for
     home shortly after the last note.

In both these cases the absence of marked hyperæsthesia or pain points to medullary hæmorrhage
(hæmato-myelia) as the pathological condition produced by the injury. In this particular they
contrast well with case 94 quoted on page 315, where the degree of both hyperæsthesia and pain
indicated a combination of pressure and irritation of the nerve roots by surface hæmorrhage
on the affected side. In case 97 the persistence for four weeks of paralysis of the bladder
and rectum suggested medullary hæmorrhage in addition, while the return of patellar reflex
in the paralysed limb negatived the occurrence of an extensive destructive lesion.

In view of the extreme interest of these cases I will shortly detail one other in which the
cauda equina alone was affected.

I must confess my inability to place the case definitely in the category either of concussion
or medullary hæmorrhage. As so often happened, both conditions probably took part in the lesion.
The immediate development of the primary symptoms is no doubt to be referred to concussion,
while the patchy nature of the prolonged lesion and gradual recession of the symptoms point
to the presence of hæmorrhages. We find here the link most nearly connecting the spinal cord
and the peripheral systemic nerves. Such a case goes far to show that the condition which I
have in the next chapter often referred to as nerve contusion may in fact be produced by an
injury far short of actual contact.

     (98) A trooper in the Imperial Yeomanry, while advancing in the
     crouching attitude, was struck by a bullet from his left front,
     at an estimated distance of 300 yards. The bullet traversed the
     right arm anteriorly to the humerus, entered the trunk in the
     line of the posterior axillary fold, 1-1/2 inch below the level
     of the nipple, crossed the thoracic and abdominal cavities,
     deeply striking the lumbar spine, and finally lodged beneath
     the skin over the venter of the left ilium. The skin was
     broken, but the force of the bullet was not sufficient to cause
     it to pass through, and it was later expressed from the wound
     by the surgeon. The bullet was a Mauser, and not in any way
     deformed, although it must at any rate have struck the spine
     and perforated the ilium.

     Immediate paraplegia resulted, both sensation and motor power
     were completely abolished, but there was no trouble either with
     the bladder or rectum. No symptoms of injury to either thoracic
     or abdominal viscera were noted.

     Three days after the injury sensation and some return of motor
     power were observed in the left extremity, and some power of
     movement in the toes of the right foot.

     During the next eight weeks steady but slow improvement took
     place; during the last three weeks of this period he made the
     voyage to England. Ever since the injury some elevation of
     temperature was noted, a rise at night to 100° or at times to
     102°; for this no definite cause was discovered. In the tenth
     week the condition was as follows: The temperature has become
     normal. The patient has lost flesh to a considerable extent
     since the reception of the injury. The lower extremities are
     much wasted, especially the peroneal muscles. Patellar reflexes
     can be obtained, but the knee jerks are uncertain. Unevenly
     distributed paralysis exists in both lower extremities.
     Left--Sensation fairly good throughout. Quadriceps very weak;
     does not react to electrical stimulation. Calf muscles act
     fairly. Anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous groups are
     paralysed. Right--Quadriceps acts better than on left, muscles
     below the knee paralysed, and in the same area there is
     complete absence of sensation. The patient complains of
     shooting pains in both legs, and there is some deep muscular
     tenderness.

     Three weeks later an abundant crop of vesicles appeared over
     the front of the right thigh and leg, above and below the knee.
     Sensation in the limb at the same time returned to a
     considerable degree, anæsthesia persisting on the outer aspect
     of the thigh only.

     At the end of four months very considerable improvement had
     taken place, but there was no return of motor power in the
     right leg, or the muscles supplied by the peroneal nerve in the
     left leg. There was some general oedema of the legs,
     especially of the right, possibly in connection with the
     herpetic eruption which was now disappearing. Muscular
     tenderness had disappeared. There was also definite improvement
     in the size and tone of the peroneal muscles, although no motor
     power was regained.

     At the end of five months, slight gradual improvement was still
     taking place, but the loss of power was nearly as extensive as
     when the last note was taken. The skin of the right leg was
     glossy, that of the left apparently normal. At times some
     hyperæsthesia of the soles was noted, and the plantar reflex
     was very brisk.

     The right anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous groups of
     muscles reacted to the strongest faradic current, not to any
     galvanic current below 20-25 m.a., contraction very sluggish.
     The same muscles in the left leg also reacted to the strongest
     faradic current, but only locally, with no sort of effect on
     the tendons. Similar contractions could be induced in the right
     quadriceps, but none in the left (Dr. Turney).

     Appreciation of heat and cold applied to the skin was fair,
     but, in the case of heat, distinctly slow in the right leg and
     foot.

     At the end of seven months improvement was still taking place;
     the patient could now stand, walk a little with crutches, and
     even ascend and descend a staircase.

     Severe concussion, contusion, or medullary hæmorrhage
     producing signs of total transverse lesion, and complete
     transverse section.--The symptoms of these conditions will be
     taken together, because, with very slight variations, they may
     be considered as lesions of equal degree as to severity, bad
     prognosis, and unsuitability for active interference.

     All were characterised by the exhibition of the same essential
     phenomena, symmetrical abolition of sensation and motor power
     on either side of the body, absence of any signs of irritation
     in the paralysed area, and loss of patellar reflex. In a small
     number of the cases of medullary hæmorrhage some return of
     sensation was observed prior to death; in a still smaller,
     traces of motor power, and in one or two irritability of the
     muscles or feeble reflexes pointed to the fact that destruction
     of the cord was not absolute. As abstracts of a series of cases
     are appended on page 330, it is only necessary to add a few
     remarks as to any slight peculiarities which seemed directly
     dependent on the mode of causation.

     It may be first stated that these severe injuries were
     accompanied by signs of a very high degree of shock. In fact,
     the shock observed in them was more severe than in any other
     small-calibre bullet injuries that I witnessed. The patients
     lay still with the eyes closed, great pallor of surface,
     sometimes moaning with pain, the sensorium much benumbed, or
     occasionally early delirium was noted. The pulse was small,
     often slow and irregular, and the respiration shallow. The
     originally quiet state was often changed to one of great
     restlessness of the unparalysed part of the body, with the
     appearance of reaction.

     The degree of primary pain varied greatly, but as a rule it was
     considerable; in some cases it was excruciating in the parts
     above the level of the totally destructive lesion, and commonly
     of the zonal variety. A hyperæsthetic zone at the lower limit
     of sensation usually existed.

     In the majority of the cases pain must have depended on
     meningeal hæmorrhage. In one of the cases related, positive
     evidence was offered as to this particular by the autopsy,
     although this was made as long as six weeks after the original
     injury, since no other source of pressure or irritation was
     discovered. When I first saw this patient some twenty-four
     hours after the injury he was moaning with pain, although a
     strong and plucky man; I hastened to give him an injection of
     morphia, and assured him that it would relieve his suffering:
     as I left I heard him say to his neighbour: 'That is no use;
     they gave me three last night, and I was no better,' and his
     remark proved true.

     In high dorsal and cervical injuries the temperature rose high,
     in one case to 108° F.; I had no opportunity, however, of
     observing the temperature in any case immediately before and
     after death. During the hot weather the profuse sweating of the
     upper part of the body contrasted very strongly with the dry
     skin of the paralysed part.

     The heart's action was often particularly irregular in the
     dorsal injuries, and the respiration slow and irregular; as
     these cases, however, were often complicated by severe
     concurrent injuries to internal organs, the irregularities
     could hardly be ascribed to the spinal-cord lesion alone. In
     cases of pure diaphragmatic respiration, the rate did not as a
     rule exceed the normal of 16 or 20 to the minute, and it was
     quite regular; this was noted soon after the injury and
     persisted throughout the course of the cases. As is usually the
     case, both respiration and the heart's action were most
     embarrassed in the cases in which abdominal distension was a
     prominent feature. In some of the neck cases the Cheyne-Stokes
     type of respiration was very strongly marked.

     In cases of low dorsal injury intestinal distension was
     extreme, and I think more troublesome than the same condition
     as seen in civil practice. The distension was accompanied by
     most persistent vomiting, continuing for days, and in the cases
     that lived for some time severe gastric crises of the same type
     occurred in some instances.

     Priapism was a common symptom; but, as is seen from the cases
     quoted, was rarely due to any gross direct laceration of the
     cord.

     Trophic sores were both early to develop, and extensive;
     primary decubitus occurred in all the cases I saw, and steady
     extension followed. In one case a remarkable symmetrical
     serpiginous ulceration developed in the area of distribution of
     the cutaneous branches of the external popliteal nerve on the
     outer side of the leg.

     The paralysis in nearly every case was of the utterly flaccid
     type, and wasting of the muscles was early and extreme. This
     was occasionally accentuated by the supervention of myelitis.

     Opportunities for making observations on the quantity of urine
     secreted were not great, and I can offer no remark as to the
     occurrence of polyuria. In one rapidly fatal case, however,
     suppression of urine occurred.

     (99) Lumbar region. Transverse lesion.--Range under 1,000
     yards. Wound of entry (Mauser), over the seventh rib 1 inch
     from the left posterior axillary fold; exit, over the centre
     of the right iliac crest. Complete symmetrical motor and
     sensory paralysis of lower extremities, entire abolition of
     reflexes, retention of urine.

     On the ninth day there was some return of sensation in the
     lower extremities, and a cremasteric reflex was to be obtained.
     A large bedsore had developed over the sacrum. No further
     change occurred in the lower extremities. The patient became
     progressively emaciated and exhausted, cystitis persisted, the
     bedsore deepened. The man eventually developed signs of a large
     basal abscess in the left lung, and died on the forty-second
     day.

     At the post-mortem a fracture of the first lumbar lamina was
     discovered, with some splintering of the bone; the lumbar
     spinous process was attached and in its normal position.
     Opposite the centre of the cauda equina were the remains of a
     considerable hæmorrhage, both extra- and intra-dural, the
     nerves appearing somewhat compressed, but of normal
     consistency. The muscles of the back were infiltrated with
     putrid pus on both sides. A pulmonary abscess cavity the size
     of a hen's egg occupied the upper part of the lower lobe of the
     left lung. The kidneys were congested, and the bladder
     thickened and chronically inflamed.

     (100) Cervico-dorsal region. Total transverse lesion.--Wound
     of entry (Mauser), to the right of the sixth cervical
     vertebra: the bullet was removed on the field from the left of
     the seventh dorsal spinous process, which was somewhat
     prominent. Complete motor and sensory paralysis extended
     upwards to the third intercostal space; the breathing was
     almost entirely diaphragmatic. Retention of urine. Entire
     abolition of reflexes in lower limbs and trunk. Hyperæsthesia
     was present in both upper extremities, with a zone of
     hyperæsthesia around the chest. The patient suffered greatly
     for some weeks from pain in the hyperæsthetic area, he
     developed severe cystitis and later incontinence of urine. A
     large trophic sacral bed-sore steadily increased in depth and
     size.

     About ten days before death, which occurred on the fifty-third
     day from exhaustion and septicæmia, the patient complained of
     pains in his legs; but there was no return of sensation,
     motion, or reflexes.

     At the post-mortem, the seventh dorsal spinous process was
     found to be loose and the laminæ of the fifth, sixth, and
     seventh vertebræ were separated from the pedicles, and somewhat
     depressed on the left side. These laminæ were adherent to the
     dura, as were also a few small separated bony spiculæ. There
     was no sign of old hæmorrhage. The spinal cord was practically
     gone between the levels of the fourth and seventh dorsal
     vertebræ, and diffluent from myelitis up to the third cervical. Complete motor and sensory paralysis, with absence
     of reflexes from mid-dorsal region downwards. Upper
     intercostals working. Retention of urine, penis turgid.
     Sensation perfect to lower extremity of sternum. Early trophic
     sacral bed-sores developed and steadily increased in depth and
     extent, slighter ones developed on the heels. The paralysis was
     flaccid throughout. The patient gradually emaciated with fever,
     and died on the seventy-eighth day.

     At the post-mortem the wound proved not to have penetrated
     the thorax, and both the vertebral spines and laminæ were
     intact, no trace of bony injury being discoverable. Opposite
     the sixth dorsal vertebra, for a distance of 1-1/2 inch, the
     cord and dura were adherent, and over the same area the cord
     was represented by soft custard-like material. There was no
     sign of old hæmorrhage.

     (102) Dorsal region; total transverse lesion; slight
     extra-dural hæmorrhage.--Wound of entry (Mauser), at the
     posterior aspect of the right shoulder; exit, 2 inches to the
     left of the spine below the ninth rib.

     Complete motor and sensory paralysis below the site of the
     lesion, with absence of superficial and deep reflexes.
     Retention of urine. Great abdominal distension, pain, and
     vomiting. Bed-sores over the sacrum developed on the third day;
     meanwhile the vomiting continued on and off for a week, and
     very severe girdle pain persisted.

     One month later when seen at the Base hospital considerable
     improvement had occurred. Sensation had returned in both lower
     limbs; but flaccid paralysis persisted and both were wasted,
     especially the left. There was no return of reflexes in the
     lower limbs, the urine was passed in gushes, and the patient
     was cognisant when these occurred. The sacral bed-sores were,
     however, very extensive and becoming larger and deeper.

     At the end of the fifth week slight power was regained in the
     flexors and abductors of the right thigh, and the same muscles
     of the left limb could be made to contract feebly. Meanwhile
     the patient suffered with severe fever, accompanied by frequent
     rigors and profuse sweats; the bed-sore continued to extend,
     and the urine was foul and contained pus.

     The patient continued in a similar condition, progressive
     emaciation and exhaustion taking place, and at the end of six
     weeks he died.

     At the post-mortem the bullet was found to have tracked
     beneath the right scapula, entering the chest by the fifth
     intercostal space and lacerating the right lung; thence it
     entered the eighth dorsal centrum and tunnelled both this and
     the ninth diagonally, to escape beneath the ninth rib. On
     opening the spinal canal the tunnel was found to be separated
     only by the compact tissue of the centrum from the cavity,
     while a thin extra-dural hæmorrhage separated the dura from the
     bones anteriorly. The spinal cord exhibited no sign of pressure
     and was firm and continuous, but up to the lower limit of the
     dorsal region there was septic myelitis and meningitis, the
     result of pus having tracked up the canal from the sacral
     bedsore. Suppurative cystitis and pyelitis were present. The
     patient was the subject of an old urethral stricture which had
     given rise to trouble during treatment.

     (103) Dorsal region; total transverse lesion; slight
     intra-dural hæmorrhage.--Wound of entry (Mauser), below
     spine of scapula, close to right axilla; exit, 2-1/2 inches
     to left of tenth dorsal spinous process.

     Complete motor and sensory paralysis below ensiform cartilage,
     with well-marked hyperæsthetic zone around trunk. All reflexes
     absent. Retention of urine. Incontinence of fæces. Bed-sores in
     sacral region developed during the first two days, and
     seventeen days later well-developed serpiginous trophic sores
     developed on the outer side of each leg and continued to
     increase slowly until death. The paralysis remained of the
     absolutely flaccid variety. Great emaciation occurred,
     accompanied by hectic fever, the temperature ranging from
     normal to 102.5°. During the third week double pleurisy
     developed.

     At the post-mortem no bone injury could be detected. The cord
     and dura-mater were adherent over an area corresponding to the
     fifth to the eighth dorsal vertebræ, and opposite the seventh
     the cord was soft and of the consistence of butter. A small
     intra-dural hæmorrhage was still evident below the main lesion,
     not extensive enough to give rise to serious compression.
     General adhesions in each pleura. Cystitis.

     (104) Dorsal region; section of cord; retained bullet.--Wound
     of entry (Mauser), in seventh right intercostal space, 4-1/2
     inches from the dorsal spinous processes, oval in outline;
     bullet retained.

     Complete motor and sensory paralysis, with absence of reflexes
     below umbilicus. Retention of urine, incontinence of fæces.
     Large sacral bed-sore developed rapidly. Right hæmothorax.

     The patient emaciated rapidly, and for the last fourteen days
     the temperature ranged to 104°, the bed-sore steadily
     increasing in size. Death occurred on the forty-second day.

     At the post-mortem a Mauser bullet was found embedded in the
     centrum of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. The bullet was slightly
     curved; its anterior extremity had passed across the spinal
     canal, and wounding the dura posteriorly rested against the
     left lamina. The plating of the mantle of the bullet was
     stripped from half the area of the tip. The dura was not
     adherent, and the cord was softened for half an inch above the
     point of section; above this it was normal, the vessels
     coursing normally to the softened spot. Below the point of
     section the cord was blanched, but offered no other macroscopic
     evidence of disease. No evidence of either intra- or
     extra-dural hæmorrhage was detectible.

     The right pleura contained a large quantity of dark cocoa-like
     fluid. Extensive adhesions were present in both pleural
     cavities. The spleen was much enlarged. At the base of the
     bladder a large submucous hæmorrhage had occurred, the
     blood-clot had assumed a dark orange colour, and on first
     opening the viscus the appearance was that of a mass of fæces.
     The mucous lining elsewhere was slaty grey, with small
     hæmorrhages. The kidneys were large, but no abscesses or
     pyelitis were present.
     Slight grasping power was present in the hands, and the patient
     could hold his arms across his chest. Complete motor and
     sensory paralysis, with absence of all reflexes below. The
     pupils were moderately contracted. Retention of urine. On the
     second day blebs appeared on each buttock, and the patient
     complained of very severe pain in the neck: the temperature
     rose to 103°, and on the third day he died suddenly. No
     post-mortem examination was made.

I observed two similar cases in the Field Hospital at Orange River, the patients dying on the
third day; pain and high temperature were prominent symptoms in both. In one patient early
delirium was present.

     (106) Dorsal region; Martini-Henry wound.--Wound of entry,
     oval, 1 inch × 3-1/4 inches; long axis obliquely crossing
     infra-spinous fossa of right scapula; bullet retained
     (Martini-Henry). Spine of third dorsal vertebra loose, and a
     distinct thickening to its right side. Complete symmetrical
     paralysis extending up to upper extremities. No sensation on
     surface of trunk below cervical area. Respiration entirely
     diaphragmatic. Retention of urine, penis turgid. Total absence
     of reflexes, superficial and deep. Reddening of buttocks, but
     no bullæ.

     General hyperæsthesia of upper extremities, with severe
     spasmodic attacks of pain.

     On the third day an exploration was decided upon, in view of
     the local deformity, and the severe pain in the upper
     extremities. The third dorsal spine was found to be loose, as a
     result of bilateral fracture of the neural arch; the bullet had
     crossed the right limit of the spinal canal, and destroyed the
     body of the vertebra, and passing onwards had entered the left
     pleural cavity, into which air entered freely from the
     operation wound.

     The patient was relieved from his pain by the exploration, and
     lived four days. On the second day after operation, however,
     the temperature rose to 107°, while on the last two days the
     temperature was normal in the mornings, rising to 105° in the
     evenings. No alteration resulted in the trunk symptoms.

Diagnosis.--The pure question of the fact of injury of the spinal cord needs no discussion;
but it is necessary to make some remarks on the discrimination between concussion, contusion
and hæmorrhage, meningeal and medullary hæmorrhage, the latter condition and compression, and
on partial and complete severance of the cord.

The sharp discrimination of cases of concussion from those of slight medullary hæmorrhage was
necessarily impossible. I think the only points of any importance in diagnosing pure concussion
were the transitory nature of the symptoms, and the uniformity of recovery, without persistence
of any signs of minor destructive lesion. In medullary hæmorrhage the tendency for a certain
period was towards increase in gravity in the signs. It goes almost without saying that the
latter point was seldom accurately determined in patients struck on the field of battle; these
perhaps lay out for hours before they were brought in, and when they were placed in the Field
hospital the rush of work did not usually allow the careful observation necessary to clear
up this difference in the development of the symptoms. Nevertheless it is preferable to consider
the cases in which transitory symptoms persist for a period of hours, or even a couple of days,
as instances of pure concussion, unless the existence of this condition can be disproved by
actual observation.

Extra-medullary hæmorrhage, accompanied by only slight encroachment on the spinal canal, certainly
results with some frequency from small-calibre wounds. Some of the quoted cases show this decisively
by post-mortem evidence, others by such clinical signs of irritation as pain and hyperæsthesia.
I think its presence may also be assumed in cases of total transverse lesion due to medullary
hæmorrhage or severe concussion, accompanied by well-marked pain and hyperæsthesia above the
level of paralysis. As affecting treatment, however, determination of its presence is of small
importance.

The important conditions for discriminative diagnosis are those of local compression, actual
destructive lesion, whether from concussion changes, contusion, or medullary hæmorrhage, and
partial and total section of the cord.

First, with regard to compression of the cord, the possible sources are three; (i) extra-dural
hæmorrhage, which may, I think, be dismissed with mention as rarely capable of producing severe
symptoms. (ii) The displacement of bone fragments. This is of less importance than in civil
practice, because an injury by a bullet of small calibre, capable of seriously displacing fragments,
has probably at the same time produced grave changes in the cord. In the presence of severe
immediate symptoms we may tentatively assume that a simultaneous destructive lesion has been
produced. In such injuries pain, combined with a tendency to improvement in the paralytic symptoms
and return of reflexes, is the only point in favour of bone pressure, unless considerable deformity
of the spinal column can be detected by palpation or examination with the X-rays.

(iii) Pressure from the bullet. This is the most important form of compression, because the
mere fact of retention of the bullet is evidence of a low degree of velocity, and therefore
opposed to the existence of the most severe form of intramedullary lesion. In a case of apparent
transverse lesion with retained bullet, shown to me at No. 3 General Hospital by Mr. J. E.
Ker, the pain was very severe, and so greatly aggravated by movement that an anæsthetic had
to be administered prior to the renewal of some necessary dressings. The general condition
of this patient precluded a projected operation, and after death the bullet was found to be
pressing laterally upon a cord not materially altered on macroscopic inspection. In the case
of retained bullet recorded (No. 104), the slight degree to which the severed ends of the cord
appeared altered has been already remarked upon.

Beyond this we are helped by the position of the aperture of entry, and its shape, as evidence
of the direction in which the bullet passed, the presence of pain, and positive proof may be
obtained by examination with the X-rays.

Lastly, we come to the discrimination of total or partial section, destruction by vibratory
concussion or contusion, and severe intramedullary hæmorrhage. Except in the case of partial
section with localised symptoms, which must be rare, I believe this to be impossible from the
primary symptoms, although some indication of possible encroachment on the canal may be obtained
from careful consideration of the course of the wound, as evidenced by the position and shape
of the openings, the position of the patient's body at the time of reception of the injury
being taken into consideration. Later we may get some aid from the possible improvement in
the symptoms in the case of hæmorrhage. In cases with signs of total transverse lesion, however,
the discrimination of the conditions is of little practical importance, since either is equally
unfavourable and unsuitable for surgical treatment.

In closing these remarks reference must be made to the occasional occurrence of paraplegic
symptoms of an apparently purely functional nature. I saw these on one or two occasions, of
which the following is a fair example. A man was wounded in the lower extremity and fell. When
brought into the hospital he complained of loss of power in the legs and inability to straighten
his back. No very definite evidence was present of serious impairment either of motor or sensory
nerves, and the man was got up and walked with crutches. While moving about the hospital camp,
another man pushed him down, and the patient then became completely paraplegic. He was placed
in bed, and the next day moved his limbs without any difficulty, and gave rise to no further
anxiety.

Prognosis.--In slight concussion the importance of prognosis is as to remote effects, and upon
this no opinion can be given at the present time. The same may be said concerning cases in
which transient symptoms followed the slighter degrees of surface and medullary hæmorrhage.
In the case of the latter, however, I think it would be rash to give a too confident opinion
as to the future non-occurrence of secondary changes.

Severe concussion is probably irrecoverable.

Meningeal hæmorrhage of either form is one of the slighter lesions, and less dangerous, both
as an immediate condition and as to the probabilities of after trouble. None the less the possibilities
of secondary chronic meningitis, or chronic trouble from adhesions, must be kept in mind.

Cases of medullary hæmorrhage with incomplete signs are favourable in prognosis, as far as
life is concerned; as to complete recovery, however, this is hardly possible; in many cases
serious functional deficiency at any rate will remain, while in others the healing of the lacerated
tissue and subsequent contraction can scarcely fail to influence unfavourably an already imperfect
recovery.

I think it must be a rare occurrence for pressure from bone fragments to be able to be regarded
as a favourable prognostic condition, since in the very large majority of cases the velocity
of the bullet causing the injury will have been such as to inflict irreparable damage on the
cord. Still, cases may occasionally be met with where the velocity has been sufficiently low,
or contact with the bone slight enough, to allow of the comparative escape of the cord. In
this relation cases in which the bullet is retained, especially if the symptoms of transverse
lesion are incomplete, may be regarded as relatively favourable.

Cervical and high dorsal injuries, as in civil practice, offered the worst prognosis. In cases
in which symptoms of total transverse lesion were present, as far as my experience went, it
was, however, only a matter of importance as to the prolongation of a miserable existence.
All the patients eventually died; those with higher lesions at the end of a few days; the lower
ones, at the completion on an average of six weeks of suffering.

The actual causes of death resembled exactly those met with in civil practice, except in so
far as it was more often influenced or determined by concurrent injuries, a complication so
characteristic of modern gunshot wounds. Thus exhaustion, septicæmia from absorption from suppurating
bed-sores or from severe cystitis, secondary myelitis, and pulmonary complications, carried
off most of the patients.

Treatment.--The general treatment of the cases demanded nothing special to military surgery,
except in so far as it was modified by the disadvantage to the patient of necessarily having
to be transported, often for some distance. The ill effects of this, particularly in cases
of hæmorrhage, are obvious, but in so far as fracture was concerned the question of transport
did not acquire the importance that it does in civil practice, since the nature of the fractures
and their strict localisation did not render movement either painful or particularly hurtful.
It was indeed striking how little pain movement, made for the purposes of examination, caused
these patients. The treatment of bed-sores, cystitis, or other secondary complications possessed
no special features.

The importance of insuring rest in the early stages of the cases of hæmorrhage is self-evident;
hence, if the possibility exists of not moving the patient, its advantage cannot be too strongly
insisted upon. Again, if transport is inevitable, the shorter distance that can be arranged
for the better. It should be borne in mind, also, that from the peculiar nature of causation
of the injuries, stretcher or wagon transport for short distances is preferable to the vibratory
movements of a long railway journey. Beyond this the administration of opium, and in some cases
the assumption of the prone position, are both useful in the recent or possibly progressive
stage of hæmorrhage.

Lastly, as to active surgical treatment by operation. In no form of spinal injury is this less
often indicated, or less likely to be useful. It is useless in the cases of severe concussion,
contusion, or medullary hæmorrhage which form such a very large proportion of those exhibiting
total tranverse lesion, and equally unsuited to cases of partial lesion of the same character.
Extra-medullary hæmorrhage can rarely be extensive enough to produce signs calling for the
mechanical relief of pressure; the section of the cord cannot be remedied. In one case with
signs of total transverse lesion, in which a laminectomy was performed, no apparent lesion
was discovered, and this would frequently be the case, since the damage is parenchymatous.
The experience was indeed exactly comparable to that which followed early exposure of the peripheral
nerves.

Only three indications for operation exist. 1. Excessive pain in the area of the body above
the paralysed segment; operation is here of doubtful practical use, except in so far as it
relieves the immediate sufferings of the patient.

2. An incomplete or recovering lesion, when such is accompanied by evidence furnished by the
position of the wounds, pain, and signs of irritation of pressure from without, or possibly
palpable displacement of parts of the vertebra, that the spinal canal is encroached upon by
fragments of bone.

3. Retention of the bullet, accompanied by similar signs to those detailed under 2.

In both the latter cases the aid of the X-rays should be invoked before resorting to exploration.

Operation, if decided upon, in either of the two latter circumstances, may be performed at
any date up to six weeks; but if pressure be the actual source of trouble, it is obvious that
the more promptly operation is undertaken the better for early relief and ulterior prognostic
chances.

In only one case of the whole series I observed did it seem possible to regret the omission
of an exploration.

CHAPTER IX

INJURIES TO THE PERIPHERAL NERVE TRUNKS

The occurrence of these injuries has undoubtedly increased in frequency with the employment
of bullets of small calibre, and no other class of case more strikingly illustrates the localised
nature of the lesions produced by small projectiles of high velocity. Again, no other series
of injuries affords such obvious indications of the firm and resistent nature of the cicatricial
tissue formed in the process of repair of small-calibre wounds, and in none is the advantage
of a conservative and expectant attitude so forcibly impressed upon the surgeon. Implication
of the nerves may be primary, or secondary to an injury which left them originally unscathed.

Nature of the anatomical lesions.--In degree these vary in mathematical progression, but the
extent of the lesion is not always readily differentiated by the early clinical manifestations,
and again the actual damage is not to be estimated by the gross apparent anatomical lesion
alone; but, in addition, consists in part in changes of a less easily demonstrable nature,
varying with the velocity with which the bullet was travelling and the consequent comparative
degree of vibratory force to which the nerve has been subjected. In these injuries, as in those
of every part of the nervous system, the degree of velocity appears to gain especial importance
both in regard to the general symptoms and the local effect on the functional capacity of the
nerve.

This is perhaps a fitting place for the introduction of a few further remarks as to the significance
of the term 'concussion' in connection with the injuries produced by bullets of small calibre,
since the most striking exemplification of the results following the transmission of the vibratory
force of the projectile is afforded by the behaviour of the comparatively densely ensheathed
and supported peripheral nerves.

As already pointed out in Chapters VII. and VIII. the chief concussion effects on the nervous
tissue of the brain and spinal cord are of a destructive nature, far exceeding those accompanying
the injuries designated by the same term seen in the ordinary accidents met with in civil practice,
and this damage is comparatively localised in extent.

In the case of the peripheral nerves I have still employed the terms 'concussion' and 'contusion'
to designate certain groups of symptoms and clinical phenomena, but any sharp distinction between
the two conditions on a morbid anatomical basis is impossible. The results of severe vibratory
concussion may, in fact, be more generally destructive than those of contusion, and the subsequent
effects more prolonged. A certain length of the affected nerve is apparently completely destroyed
as a conductor of impulses, the connective-tissue element alone remaining intact. Under these
circumstances a nerve, the subject of the most serious degree of vibratory concussion, which,
if cut down upon, may exhibit no macroscopic change, may take a longer period to recover than
one in which the presence of considerable local thickening points to direct contact with the
bullet, with resulting hæmorrhage into the nerve sheath and perhaps partial gross rupture of
nerve fibres.

The therapeutic and prognostic importance of the above remarks, if correct, is obvious. The
course of the nerve is preserved by its intact connective-tissue framework, and ultimate recovery
by a regeneration of the nerve fibres is more likely to be complete, and will be just as rapid,
if nature be relied on and the nerve be left untouched by the hand of the surgeon.

It is, I think, undeniable that nerve trunks may escape severe or irrecoverable injury by lateral
displacement. The mere fact that the trunk itself may be perforated by a slit in its long axis
would suggest the possibility of displacement of the whole structure, and this no doubt occurred
with some frequency. Displacement would naturally be most frequent in the case of nerves, such
as those of the arm, which run long courses in comparatively loose tissue. In a remarkable
case already narrated, an exploratory operation showed the musculo-spiral nerve in the upper
part of the arm to have been driven into a loop which projected into, and provisionally closed,
an opening in the brachial artery.

I. Simple concussion.--Anatomically, or histologically, no information exists as to the changes
which give rise to the often transitory symptoms dependent on this condition. We are reduced
to the same theories of molecular disturbance and change which have been invoked to account
for similar affections of the central nervous system. The causation of concussion is, however,
materially influenced in its degree by the velocity of flight of the bullet and consequent
severity of the vibratory force exerted. Hence actual contact of the bullet with the nerves
is not necessary for its production, as is seen in the temporary complete loss of functional
capacity in the limbs in many cases of fracture, where the vibrations are rendered still more
far-reaching and effective as the result of their wider distribution from the larger solid
resistance afforded by the bone. The relative density and resistance offered by the different
parts of the bone acquire great significance in this relation, since local shock due to nerve
concussion is far more profound when the shafts are struck than when the cancellous ends furnish
the point of impact.

The form of concussion which most nearly interests us in this chapter is that affecting single
nerve trunks in wounds of the soft parts alone, and here the passage of the bullet is, as a
rule, so contiguous to the nerve that there is difficulty in drawing a strict line of demarcation
between such cases and those dealt with in the next paragraph.

II. Contusion.--Clinically this was the form of nerve injury both of greatest comparative frequency
and of interest from the points of view both of diagnosis and prognosis.

The seriousness of a contusion depends on two factors: first, the relative degree of violence
exerted upon the nerve, which is dependent on the force still retained by the travelling bullet;
and, secondly, on the extent of tissue actually implicated. The range of fire at which the
injury was received determines the importance of the first factor; the second varies with the
degree of exactness with which the nerve is struck, and on the direction taken by the bullet.
Naturally transverse wounds affect a small area; while an oblique or longitudinal direction
of the track may indefinitely increase the extent of injury to the nerve trunk, and hence acquire
prognostic significance in direct ratio to the amount of tissue which needs to be regenerated.

As to the actual anatomical lesion resulting in the cases which we designated clinically as
contusion I can give no information. On many occasions when the symptoms were considered of
such a nature as to render an exploration advisable, no macroscopic evidence of gross injury
was obtained. It was therefore impossible to draw a definite line of demarcation between such
cases and those which we considered merely concussion. It could only be assumed that the vibration
transmitted to the nerve had occasioned such changes as to destroy its capacity as a conductor
of impressions.

In some cases the presence of a certain amount of interstitial blood extravasation was suggested
clinically by early hyperæsthesia and signs of irritation; in others the paralysis was of such
a degree as to lead to the inference that a complete regeneration of the existing nerve would
be necessary prior to the restitution of functional capacity.

In a certain proportion of the injuries the development of a distinct fusiform swelling in
the course of the nerve pointed to the existence of considerable tissue damage, while in others
this was evidenced clinically by early signs of neuritis.

III. Division or laceration.--The varying mechanical conditions affecting the last class of
injury play a similar rôle here. Thus the degree of laceration depends on the direction of
the wound track, and as all lacerations are accompanied by contusion, the relative velocity
retained by the travelling bullet assumes the same importance.

I saw every degree of injury to the trunks, from notching to complete solution of continuity,
and in some cases destruction and disappearance of pieces from one to two or more inches in
length. Such lesions as the latter were most common in the forearm. In this segment of the
limbs tracks of varying degrees of longitudinal obliquity are readily produced, whether the
patient be in the upright or prone position, since the upper extremities are commonly in forward
action whichever position is assumed.

The most peculiar form of injury consisted in perforation of the trunk without gross destruction
of its fibres, and without in many cases prolonged or permanent loss of functional capacity.
I cannot speak with any confidence as to the comparative frequency of occurrence of this form
of injury, but judging by the analogous perforations of the vessels, it is probably not uncommon
in trunks large enough to allow of its production. The trunk nerves of the arm, and the great
sciatic nerve, were probably the most frequent seats of such wounds. As, however, a very short
experience of the futility of early interference in the case of nerve lesions warned me against
exploration before a date at which observations of this nature were unsatisfactory, I gained
less experience on this point than I could have wished.

In the case of completely divided nerves the development of a bulbous enlargement on the proximal
end was constant, and very marked in degree. I saw few cases in which primary effects could
be certainly referred to pressure or laceration by bone spicules, excepting in some fractures
of the humerus, and perhaps some injuries of the seventh nerve accompanying perforating wounds
of the mastoid process.

IV. Secondary implication of the nerves.--This was a striking characteristic in many at first
apparently simple wounds of the soft parts. In such cases it was due to implication of the
contiguous trunk in the process of cicatrisation, and its importance varied with the size of
the nerve in question. In the smaller sensory trunks it was often evidenced by the occurrence
of neuralgic pain, especially liable to be influenced by climatic changes; in the larger, by
signs of more or less severe motor, sensory, and trophic disturbance. Musculo-spiral paralysis
from implication in, or pressure from, callus in cases of fracture of the humerus was very
frequent. This would naturally be expected from the extreme degree the comminution of the bone
often reached, and the consequently large amount of callus developed.

The effect of cicatrisation of the tissues surrounding the nerves varied somewhat according
to the degree of fixation of the individual nerve implicated. Thus if a nerve lay in a fixed
bed some form of circular constriction resulted; if, on the other hand, the nerve was readily
displaceable, the cicatrix often drew it considerably out of its course; in either case symptoms
corresponding with those of pressure resulted.

Symptoms of nerve lesion.--These differed little in character from those common to such injuries
in civil practice, except in the relative frequency with which they assumed a serious aspect.
After all in civil practice nerve concussion is most familiar to us in the degree common after
knocking the elbow against a hard object, and the same may be said in regard to the allied
injury of contusion. It is in small-calibre bullet wounds alone that the occurrence of such
severe and sharply localised injury to deep parts as was observed is possible.

Concussion.--Temporary loss of function was often observed in the limbs, corresponding to the
distribution of one or more nerve trunks when wound tracks had passed in their vicinity. Interference
with function sometimes amounted to loss of sensation alone: in others to loss of both sensation
and motor power. Such symptoms were of a transitory character, lasting for a few days or a
week; if both sensation and motion were impaired, sensation was usually the first to be regained.
In these cases secondary trouble was not uncommon, since the near proximity of the track to
the originally affected nerve offered every chance for implication of the latter in the resulting
cicatrix. This sequence was often observed, and its symptoms are described under the heading
of secondary implication below. Equally striking were the instances of concussion in the case
of the nerves of special sense and their end organs, temporary loss of smell, vision, or hearing
being not uncommon, often passing off in the course of a few days with no apparent ulterior
ill-effect.

One of the most interesting illustrations of the occurrence of concussion was furnished by
cases in which complete paralysis of a limb rapidly cleared up with the exception of that corresponding
to a single individual nerve of the complex apparently originally implicated. Instances of
severe contusion or division of one nerve of the arm, for instance, accompanied by transient
signs of concussion of varying degrees of severity in all the others, were by no means uncommon.

Contusion.--The symptoms of contusion were somewhat less simple, since, in addition to lowering
or loss of function, signs of irritation were often observed. In the slighter cases irritation
was often a marked feature, as was evidenced by hyperæsthesia and pain combined with loss of
power. In cases in which pain and hyperæsthesia were primary symptoms, these were often transitory.
I will quote an illustrative case which, though affecting the nerve roots, is characteristic
of the effects of slight contusion in the case of the nerve trunks in any part of their course:--

     (107) Contusion of cervical nerve roots.--Range probably
     about 1,000 yards. Wounded at Belmont. Aperture of entry
     (Lee-Metford), immediately posterior to the right fifth
     cervical transverse process; exit, immediately anterior to
     the space between the third and fourth left cervical transverse
     processes. The movements of the neck were perfect, there was
     neither pain nor difficulty in swallowing. Extreme
     hyperæsthesia was present in both palms and down the front of
     the forearms. The grip in either hand was weak, this being
     possibly explained in part by the hyperæsthesia of the palms,
     as all movements of the upper extremities could be made,
     although not with full power. On the fourth day the condition
     was much improved on the left side, and at the end of a week
     the left upper extremity was normal; the right (side of entry,
     and therefore exposed to greater force from the bullet)
     improved more slowly, becoming normal only at the end of three
     weeks.

I observed an identical case of injury to the cervical roots, and many similar instances in
injuries of the nerve trunks of the limbs in which the course was exactly parallel. In the
more severe, pain was often added to hyperæsthesia.

In the most severe cases the signs corresponded in all particulars, except in the early entire
loss of reaction of the muscles to electricity, with those of complete section. Loss of sensation
and motion was immediate, complete, and prolonged, the limbs being lowered in temperature,
flaccid, and powerless. General systemic shock was also severe. In the case either of plexus
or multiple contusions, or where the injury was more local, correspondingly complete signs
were present in the area supplied by the affected nerves.

In the cases in which the contusion was not of extreme degree, hyperæsthesia often developed
as a later sign, and was probably due to the irritation of hæmorrhage, when the sensory portion
of the nerve began to regain functional capacity. The date of appearance of the hyperæsthesia
varied from a few days to a week or later. It might then persist for weeks or many months.

In a few instances large blebs rose on the back of the hand, or patches of vesicles appeared
over the terminal distribution of the nerve, pointing to early trophic changes.

The period of recovery varied greatly; in some instances of very complete paralysis, function
was regained and became apparently normal at the end of three or four weeks; in others, even
after severe wasting of muscles for weeks, rapid improvement occurred often suddenly, while
in some there was no apparent recovery at the end of months. In cases of long-deferred improvement,
wasting of the muscles became a very prominent feature; but this without complete loss of reaction
of the muscles to electrical stimulation.

Recovery of sensation usually preceded by some time that of motion, the former often reappearing
in some degree at an early date, and, even if very modified in character, it formed a most
useful and valuable aid both in diagnosis and prognosis.

When in a position allowing of direct examination, the contused portion of the nerve sometimes
developed a palpable fusiform thickening, manipulation of which might give rise to formication
in the area of distribution--a favourable prognostic sign.

Many of the cases bore a very marked resemblance in character to those in which paralysis results
from tight constriction of the limb, as in the arm after the application of an Esmarch's tourniquet.

Laceration.--If incomplete, the signs corresponded very nearly to those of severe contusion,
since partial section is impossible without the occurrence of the latter. The condition indeed
was only to be distinguished by the partial nature of the recovery, and even this latter might
be only more prolonged.

The same remarks hold good with regard to perforation of the nerve trunks; but, as regards
function, these injuries are not so serious in prognosis as very much more limited transverse
divisions or mere notching, and in some cases the disturbance of function was by no means profound
or prolonged.

Absolute loss of reaction to electrical stimulus from above was the only pathognomonic sign
of actual section, unless the position of the nerve was such as to allow of palpation, when
the presence of a bulbous end at once settled the difficulty. In many cases of superficial
tracks with division of such nerves as the long or short saphenous, the early development of
bulbs in the course of the trunks gave positive information, and these were often observed.

Traumatic neuritis.--This was a common sequence of contusion of the nerve itself, or of its
subsequent inclusion in a cicatrix or callus. It was evidenced by hyperæsthesia both superficial
and deep, pain, contracture, wasting of the muscles, local sweating, and the development of
glossy skin.

Examples of this condition were seen in the case of nearly every nerve in the body. In frequency
of occurrence, degree of severity, and in its selection of individual nerves considerable variation
was met with. With regard to the two former points, personal idiosyncrasy, and degree of or
peculiarity in the nature of the injury, are the only explanations I can suggest. Perhaps in
some instances exposure to wet or cold in the early stages of the injury was of some import.
Thus, I saw several severe cases of musculo-spiral neuritis in men who were wounded during
the trying and wet march on Bloemfontein. I did not observe that suppuration or wound complications
seemed important explanatory moments, as most of the cases occurred in wounds that healed rapidly.

With regard to the question of selection; the same nerves that appear particularly liable to
suffer from idiopathic inflammations, toxic influences, or to be the seat of ascending changes
(e.g. ulnar, musculo-spiral, and external popliteal), were those most often affected by secondary
neuritis. Many of the most severe cases I saw were in the musculo-spiral nerve.

Scar implication.--The signs of this most commonly commenced with neuralgia, or painful sensations
when such movements were made as to put the cicatrix on the stretch. Although such neuralgia
might not be constant, it was often observed to be troublesome when the patients were exposed
to cold in sleeping out at night, or to extra fatigue, as in long marches. The results in many
cases stopped at this point, but the size and wide distribution of certain nerves rendered
even such slight symptoms of importance; while in others well-marked signs of neuritis declared
themselves, such as glossy skin, pain, muscular wasting, and paralysis.

Ascending neuritis.--In a few cases I observed very remarkable instances of ascending neuritis,
after comparatively slight wounds. I will quote three of these as illustrations and make no
further remarks as to the symptoms. It will be observed that one is a case of ulnar, both the
others of external popliteal, neuritis:--

     (108) Ulnar nerve: secondary ascending neuritis.--Boer
     wounded at Elandslaagte. Wound of hand, implicating anterior
     two-thirds of third metacarpal bone. This bone, together with
     the middle finger, was removed, and healing took place by
     granulation slowly.

     The resulting gap allowed considerable overlapping of the
     fingers, and shortening of the corresponding digit; the index
     finger also became flexed as a result of destruction of the
     extensor tendons. Three months later the man was still in
     hospital in consequence of the tardiness with which the wound
     had healed: at this time pain was noted, which became very
     severe in the whole course of the ulnar nerve; superficial
     hyperæsthesia and deep muscular tenderness developed, but no
     wasting. Several crops of herpetic vesicles also developed over
     the distribution of the radial nerve in the hand. This pain was
     followed by spastic contracture, first of the ulnar fingers and
     later of the wrist and elbow, which could only be straightened
     by the application of considerable force. The limb was,
     therefore, kept straight by the application of a splint; and
     warm baths, and a blister applied over the course of the ulnar
     nerve, were resorted to: under this treatment the condition
     improved until the patient was well enough to be transferred as
     a prisoner, and I saw him no more.

     (109) Peroneal nerve branches.--Wounded at Colenso. Entry,
     at the anterior margin of the fibula 5 inches above the
     external malleolus; the track crossed the anterior aspect of
     the leg obliquely, to its exit 1 inch above the centre of the
     ankle joint. Incomplete paralysis of the peronei muscles
     followed, combined with progressive wasting of the whole limb,
     which at the end of a month was marked, and then commenced to
     improve.

     (110) In a second case the wound took a similar course in the
     centre of the leg, crossing the line of the branches of the
     musculo-cutaneous nerve. Motor paralysis of the peronei
     followed, together with general lowering of tactile sensation
     in the musculo-cutaneous area.

Traumatic neurosis.--In connection with the cases just quoted, mention must be made of the
fact that the functional element was often somewhat prominent. The influence of this factor
was not to be neglected in case 108; again, its presence was a feature in cases 132 and 134,
of injury to the sciatic nerve and of peripheral injury to the seventh nerve (p. 355). A remark
has been made as to the occurrence of functional paraplegia on p. 337. Again, in the case of
the organs of special sense. Case 66, of injury to the occipital lobes, showed that a mixture
of organic and functional phenomena might be a source of error, even in the determination of
the visual field in the subject of an undoubted destructive lesion. On more than one occasion
an injury was accompanied by loss of the power of speech; thus a patient who received a slight
wound of the neck did not speak again until the application of a battery by my colleague, Mr.
H. B. Robinson. A patient was also for a short time an inmate of No. 1 General Hospital, Wynberg,
who had become deaf and dumb as a result of the explosion of a shrapnel shell over his head.
This patient also did not recover his powers until he returned to the mother-country.

In many other cases of nerve concussion or contusion, the recovery of power and sensation,
or the disappearance of neuralgia or contractures, was so sudden and rapid after prolonged
continuance of the symptoms, as to suggest a very strong functional element in their origin.
The influence of the general shock to the nervous system received by the patients had an important
bearing on these phenomena, and their interest from a prognostic point of view was very great.

INJURIES TO SPECIAL NERVES

Cranial nerves.--It will be convenient first to make a few remarks concerning the nerves of
special sense.

Olfactory.--I observed temporary loss of smell on three occasions. In two instances this accompanied
transverse wounds of the bones of the face in which the upper third of the nasal cavities was
crossed; in the third a track passing obliquely downwards from the frontal region passed through
the inner wall of the orbit, and crossed the nose at a lower level. In view of the small area
of the olfactory distribution which was directly implicated, I was at first inclined to regard
the loss of smell as dependent on the presence of dried blood on the surface of the mucous
membrane, or on obstruction of the cavities from the same cause. Further observation, however,
appeared to show that it was due to concussion of the branches of the olfactory nerve, since
the loss of function persisted when the cavities were manifestly clear.

In all these cases we were confronted with the same difficulty which was experienced both in
lesions of sight and hearing, the determination as to whether the concussion was of the branches
or of the olfactory bulb. When the symptom was the accompaniment of a fracture of the roof
of the orbit, the possibility of concussion of the olfactory lobe was manifest. In all, again,
it was difficult to say what part the accompanying concussion of the branches of the fifth
nerve took in the production of the symptom. In all three cases mentioned the return of function
was gradual, but apparently fairly complete at the end of three weeks. In one it was noted
that at first the patient was conscious of an odour before he was able to discriminate its
actual nature; later he could determine the latter readily.

Optic.--Some remarks concerning lesions of the optic nerve have already been made under the
heading of wounds of the orbit. Concussion and contusion of the nerve both occurred, but I
was unable to differentiate between the effects of these on the nerve itself, apart from the
effects on the globe of the eye, which usually accompanied wounds of the orbit.

In some cases the nerve was directly divided in orbital wounds, and either pressure on or division
of the nerve in the intra-cranial portion of its course, or as it traversed the optic foramen,
was not uncommon.

Auditory.--Loss of hearing was also not infrequent; thus it accompanied all three wounds of
the mastoid process quoted under the heading of the seventh nerve, also two cases of fracture
of the occipital bone near the ear quoted on p. 278. In all these instances it was impossible
to attribute the deafness to lesion of the nerve alone, as the causative injury equally affected
the internal ear, and in at least two the bullet implicated the tympanum as well in its course.
The deafness was absolute in each case, and in none had any improvement occurred at the end
of nine months. Deafness was a symptom in a certain number of the more severe cerebral injuries
in which the course of the bullet was not so near to the internal ear: probably some of these
were central in origin.

I only once observed any interference with the sense of taste.

Remaining cranial nerves.--I have little to say regarding the third, fourth, and sixth nerves.
In the case of the third nerve, ptosis was occasionally seen in wounds of the skull involving
the roof of the orbit, but the relative parts taken by injury to nerve and laceration or fixation
of muscle respectively, were usually hard to determine. Again, the fourth and sixth nerves
may have been damaged in some of the more extensive orbital wounds, especially those in which
the globe suffered injury, but the signs under such circumstances were difficult to discriminate,
and the injury was of slight practical importance, in view of the major injury to the globe itself.

Fifth nerve.--Concussion, contusion, or laceration of the different branches of the three divisions
of the fifth nerve were common in wounds of the head, but most frequent in fractures of the
upper or lower jaws. Localised anæsthesia was common from one or other of these causes, but
for the most part transitory in the cases of contusion or concussion. I saw no case of entire
loss of function in any one division, symptoms being mostly confined to certain branches, as
the supra-orbital, the temporo-malar, the dental branches of the second division, the auriculo-temporal
nerve, and the lingual, dental, and mental branches of the third division. I did not observe
any cases in which modification of the special senses accompanied these injuries beyond those
mentioned in the remarks already made on the subject of anosmia, and one case in which some
modification of the sense of taste accompanied an injury to the floor of the mouth. It was
a matter of surprise, considering the frequency with which subsequent neuritis was met with
in the nerves generally, that trifacial neuralgia in some form was not more often met with.
I never observed any serious case. Perhaps this is one of the fields in which a longer after-period
may increase our knowledge. Lastly, I never observed motor paralysis in the case of the third
division, although sensory symptoms in some of the branches were common, evident proof that
injuries to the trunk were rare.

Seventh nerve.--Facial paralysis was most commonly observed in cases of wound of the mastoid
process, apart from central cortical facial paralyses, of which several are quoted in the chapter
on injuries of the head. All the wounds of the mastoid process were, in addition, accompanied
by absolute deafness. I am sorry to be unable to give any details as to the electrical condition
of the muscles in these cases, but I believe that in the great majority the paralysis was mainly
the result of nerve concussion, since the perforations were clean in character and not obviously
accompanied by comminution. Pressure from hæmorrhage into the Fallopian canal may, of course,
have been present, and in some instances, particularly those in which the bullet traversed
the tympanic cavity, spicules of bone may have caused laceration. In every case, however, all
the branches were equally affected; the paralysis was absolute, and in none did any improvement
occur while the cases were under my observation.

The following are a few illustrative examples:--

     (111) Boer wounded at Belmont. Entry, immediately above
     zygoma; the bullet passed through the temporal fossa, fractured
     the neck of the mandible, traversed the mastoid process, and
     emerged at the lower margin of the hairy scalp, 1 inch from the
     median line. Facial paralysis was complete, and there was no
     improvement at the end of ten weeks.

     (112) Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry, at the posterior
     border of the left mastoid process, 1/2 an inch above the tip;
     exit, through the right upper lip at the junction of the
     middle and outer thirds. There was considerable hæmorrhage from
     the left ear. The injury was followed by complete deafness, and
     facial paralysis, which showed no sign of improvement.

     There was complete anæsthesia over the area of distribution of
     the third division of the fifth nerve; this improved rapidly,
     and at the end of five weeks was hardly to be detected; neither
     at that time could any impairment of power on the part of the
     muscles of mastication be detected. No impairment of the sense
     of taste was noted.

     (113) Entry, above the anterior extremity of the zygoma,
     bullet retained. Primary hæmorrhage from ear. Complete facial
     paralysis and deafness. Anæsthesia over distribution of
     temporal branch of temporo-malar nerve, part of supra-orbital
     area, auriculo-temporal nerve, and small occipital cervical
     nerve. The muscles of mastication acted well. Ecchymosis below
     the right mastoid process.

     (114) Wounded at Paardeberg. 300 yards. (Eye destroyed.) Complete right facial paralysis; deaf,
     on right side cannot hear tick of watch either held close or in
     contact. Purulent otitis media.

In this place I might mention two other cases of lesion of the seventh nerve secondary to wound
of peripheral branches. In one a patient was struck by several fragments of lead from a bullet
which broke up against a neighbouring stone. These for the most part lodged in the skin over
the left orbicularis muscle, but one also lodged in the conjunctiva and was removed. Some ten
days later the patient complained that he could not lift the upper lid. The levator palpebræ
was normal, but spasm of the orbicularis held the eye firmly closed. The condition did not
improve, and the patient was invalided home. He recovered later.

In another patient a bullet entered above the right zygoma and traversed the orbits, without
wounding the globes. At the time no want of power of the muscles of the face was noted, but
a year later there was evident weakness of the whole of the muscles of the right side of the
face, with loss of symmetry.

In the former case the functional element was strong, but in both an ascending neuritis was
probably present.

Tenth nerve.--The pneumogastric was implicated in many wounds of the neck. I never observed
an uncomplicated case, but laryngeal paralysis was temporarily present in two of the cases
of cervical aneurism in which the wound crossed above the level of origin of the recurrent
laryngeal branch, while in two others the recurrent branch itself was in close contact with
the wall of the aneurism (p. 135). In all such cases signs of concussion or contusion of the
nerve would be expected, judging from the similar results observed in the brachial nerves when
the neighbouring artery was implicated. The only obvious symptoms occurring, however, were
laryngeal paralysis and acceleration of the pulse. As the latter symptom was often observed
in the cases of arterio-venous communication, wherever situated, and as the sympathetic nerve
also lay in close contiguity to the wound track, it was difficult to ascribe it with certainty
solely to the vagus lesion. In the two cases of high vagus injury the laryngeal paralysis steadily
improved, and at the end of six months was apparently well; in the two others it persisted
at the end of three months and a year respectively.

The nerve must have been very frequently damaged in wounds of the neck; it is possible that
this injury may have been an important factor in the death of some of the patients with cervical
wounds upon the field.

Eleventh nerve.--I append the only case of localised spinal accessory paralysis I observed.
This was one of my earliest experiences, and when I examined the neck, in the Field hospital,
I assumed from the completeness of the sterno-mastoid and trapezius paralysis that the nerve
was severed. The patient, however, made such a rapid recovery that it became evident that the
nerve had been contused only, and that the recovery of function was not due, as is so often
the case, to vicarious compensation by the cervical supply to the muscles.

     (115) Entry, immediately to the right of the fourth cervical
     spinous process; exit, at the anterior border of the left
     sterno-mastoid opposite the angle of the mandible. The left
     shoulder was depressed, the head inclined to the injured side.
     There was evident spinal accessory paralysis, and marked
     hyperæsthesia of the whole left upper extremity, most severe in
     the circumflex area. The hyperæsthesia gradually disappeared in
     a few days, and was clearly due to concussion and possibly
     slight contusion of the cervical nerve roots. The spinal
     accessory paralysis improved, so that the patient returned to
     the front at the end of a month: when I saw him some four
     months later the shoulders were held quite symmetrically.

The twelfth nerve was occasionally damaged in wounds of the floor of the mouth. I saw no case
of permanent paralysis.

Injury to the systemic nerves. Cervical plexus.--Evidence of injury to the superficial branches
of the cervical plexus was not rare; thus I saw cases of small occipital anæsthesia, and great
occipital neuralgia, but none of motor paralysis from injury to the deeper muscular branches.
I take it that the smallness of the branches, and the multiple supply possessed by many of
the muscles of the neck, would both take part in rendering certain evidence of the injury of
an individual motor nerve rare.

Brachial plexus.--Injury to this plexus in the neck was common; the main peculiarity observed
was the partial nature of the damage inflicted.

Thus injury to a single nerve, or to a complex of two or more, was far more common than one
implicating the whole plexus. Again, while complete paralysis might affect one set of nerves,
another might simply exhibit signs of irritation in the form of hyperæsthesia or pain.

The wounds producing these injuries varied much in direction; thus some crossed the neck transversely,
some were obliquely transverse, while others took a more or less vertical course.

These same remarks hold good in the case of the nerves of the arm. In the upper half, especially,
complex injury was not rare, while in the lower third affection of individual nerves was more
common. Another important difference must be mentioned in regard to the upper and lower segments
of the course of the brachial nerves; they are not only more widely distributed below, but
also more fixed in position, a fact antagonistic to the escape of the nerve by displacement
and liable to expose it to more severe contusion.

The latter point holds good in the forearm also; here, individual injuries often occurred.

While at work in the Field hospital alone I gained the impression that the musculo-spiral nerve
would not retain the unenviable character of being the most vulnerable nerve of the upper extremity,
since the chances of each individual nerve seemed about equal, putting the question of the
long course of the musculo-spiral nerve against the humerus out of question. This expectation
was, however, not confirmed, since the musculo-spiral itself, if not primarily affected, was
so often the seat of secondary mischief in fractures of the humerus. The posterior interosseous
branch seemed to exhibit a similar vulnerability to slight injuries, to be referred to later
under the external popliteal of the lower extremity. Again, in complex injuries of the brachial
plexus, or nerve trunks, the musculo-spiral branch rarely escaped being a member, if not individually
singled out.

Of the thoracic nerves I have little to say. They must have been often injured in the thoracic
wounds, yet, as far as my experience went, intercostal neuralgia was uncommon, or at any rate
not a special feature. One observation of interest, however, does exist; in the cases in which
the ribs were fractured by bullets travelling across them within the thorax, pain was distinctly
a prominent feature. This was no doubt referable to the facts that in such instances the intercostal
nerves were especially liable to direct injury, and that this was often multiple. On one occasion
a crop of herpetic vesicles developed along the course of a dorsal nerve in an injury implicating
a single intercostal space posteriorly.

Lumbar plexus.--Although not quite so well arranged to escape bullet wounds as the thoracic
nerves, the lumbar, by reason of their deep position and the comparatively wide area they cover,
together with the rarity of wounds taking a sufficiently longitudinal direction to cross the
course of more than one or two branches, were also comparatively rarely damaged. I never saw
an uncomplicated case of anterior crural paralysis, and rarely cruralgia. I think this is to
be explained in two ways: first, that the trunk course of the nerve is short; secondly, that
it lies in the inguinal fossa. The second fact is of importance, since wounds in this region
were in my experience responsible for a considerable percentage of the deaths on the field
or shortly afterwards. Such deaths probably occurred from internal hæmorrhage from the iliac
arteries, and it was in such cases that the anterior crural nerve stood in greatest danger
of injury. I also never saw a case of localised obturator paralysis. On the other hand, anæsthesia
or hyperæsthesia in the area of distribution of the lumbar nerves in the groin, the external
cutaneous and the long saphenous in the thigh, were not uncommon. Hyperæsthesia developed in
more than one case in which injury to the psoas had led to hæmorrhage into the muscle sheath.

Sacral plexus.--The sacral plexus is far more liable to extensive direct injury than either
of the two preceding. Its cords are larger, gathered up into a much smaller space, and more
liable to injury, from the fact that the slope in which they lie is more readily followed by
a bullet track. Again, the cords rest for a considerable portion of their course on a bony
bed, a particularly dangerous position in gunshot wounds, since the nerves are not only exposed
to the danger of direct wound, or pressure from bony spicules, but also readily receive transmitted
vibrations secondary to impact of the bullet with the bone.

None the less I had few occasions to observe extensive injuries of the plexus. In one instance
damage particularly affecting the lumbo-sacral cord occurred, but this was complicated by signs
of irritation of the anterior crural and obturator nerves, as the result of retro-peritoneal
hæmorrhage and injury to the psoas muscle. Two cases in which the sacro-coccygeal plexus suffered
isolated injury on account of their characteristic nature as gunshot injuries will be shortly
quoted:

     (116) Sacro-coccygeal plexus.--Entry, at the junction of
     the middle and posterior thirds of the left iliac crest; the
     bullet passed obliquely downwards through the pelvis to lodge 3
     inches below the right trochanter major. Incontinence of soft
     fæces persisted for five weeks, and retention of urine during
     three weeks.

     This patient subsequently died on the homeward voyage, but I am
     unable to say from what cause.

     (117) Entry, over third sacral vertebra; exit, 2 inches
     from the median line, and 1-1/2 inch above Poupart's ligament
     on the anterior abdominal wall. Incontinence, with involuntary
     passage of fæces, persisted during the first twenty-four hours,
     and for two days the urine had to be withdrawn with a catheter.
     No further signs of nerve injury were noted.

The same explanation of the comparative rarity of injuries to the sacral plexus that has been
already given in the case of the anterior crural nerve holds good--viz. that in a great many
of the pelvic wounds involving the plexus early death followed from the severity of the concurrent
injuries.

Injuries to the great sciatic nerve outside the pelvis, or to one of its constituent elements,
on the other hand, formed one of the most familiar of the nerve lesions. The wounds giving
rise to these were of the most diverse character; some crossed the buttock in a vertical, transverse,
or oblique direction; others travelled through the thigh in corresponding directions, while
a third series involved both buttock and thigh.

The size of the great sciatic nerve renders complete laceration by a bullet of small calibre
a matter almost of impossibility; hence complete division may almost be left out of consideration
in the case of this nerve. On the other hand, partial division, perforation, and severe contusion
are each and all favoured by the same factor.

With an extended thigh the nerve is in a state of comparatively slight tension, and this may
be still lessened if the knee be flexed. This factor, together with the density of the sheath
of the nerve, favours the possibility of displacement, and this occurrence is more likely in
the lower segment than in the upper, which is comparatively fixed in position.

Clinical experience appeared to illustrate the importance of these anatomical factors, as the
worst cases of sciatic injury that I saw were in connection with wounds of the buttock or the
junction of that segment of the trunk with the thigh.

The most striking observation with regard to the injuries of the great sciatic nerve was the
comparatively frequent escape of the popliteal element and the severe lesion of the peroneal.
This was so pronounced as to amount to as high a proportion of peroneal symptoms as 90 per
cent., and often when the whole nerve was implicated the popliteal signs were of the irritative,
the peroneal of the paralytic type. When bullets crossed the popliteal space, given wounds
of equal severity in corresponding degrees of contiguity to the respective nerves, the peroneal
element always suffered in greater degree. Again, the peroneal nerve symptoms were more obstinate
and prolonged, and instances of ascending neuritis were more common than in the case of any
other nerve of the lower extremity, and the trophic wasting of muscles was more marked.

The peroneal nerve, therefore, acquires the same unenviable degree of importance in the lower
extremity enjoyed by the musculo-spiral in the upper. Here, again, we are confronted with the
fact that the peroneal element of the great sciatic nerve is the more prone to idiopathic inflammations
or toxic influences, and hence we can only assume it to possess a special vulnerability. The
peroneal element is of course somewhat the more exposed, as lying posterior; but it seems unreasonable
to assume that so large a proportion of the injuries can implicate the posterior segment of
the nerve as to make the startling difference in the incidence of degeneration explicable.
In this relation we may bear in mind that the muscles supplied by this nerve suffer most in
the degeneration subsequent to anterior polio-myelitis, and again that in cerebral hemiplegia
or spinal-cord injuries they are the last to recover. Unfortunately no explanation of these
remarkable facts, so forcibly impressed by the large series of cases with peroneal symptoms
seen in a short time, is forthcoming.

I may dismiss the other branches of the sacral plexus in a few words. The small sciatic was
occasionally injured in its course in the buttock, and the small saphenous in the leg. When
either element of the latter was injured, it was surprising how sharply the imperfections in
the anæsthesia corresponded with the composite character of the nerve.

CASES OF NERVE INJURY

The following cases are added mainly to give some idea of the comparative frequency with which
the individual nerves were injured, and also to exemplify the more common forms of complex
injury met with. Circumstances, unfortunately, did not always allow of extended observation
at the time, and I have not been very fortunate in my attempts to obtain subsequent information
on this series since my return. A certain amount of prognostic information is, however, furnished
by some of the records, and I am very much indebted to my colleague, Dr. Turney, for help in
this matter.

     (118) Brachial plexus.--Entry, 2 inches above the clavicle
     at the anterior margin of the trapezius; exit, first
     intercostal space, 1 inch from the sternal margin. Heavy dull
     pain developed at once, extending down the upper extremity. A
     fortnight later this pain still persisted; there was lowered
     sensation in the ulnar area with formication, also lowered
     sensation in the internal cutaneous area of distribution;
     sensation in the lesser internal cutaneous area was normal. The
     patient went home with the nerve symptoms well at the end of a
     month.

     (119) Brachial plexus injury.--Wounded at Magersfontein. Emphysema and considerable
     blood extravasation developed in the posterior triangle of the
     neck, also loss of power in the musculo-spiral distribution,
     but no anæsthesia. At the end of the first fortnight there was
     evident wasting of the muscles, but some power was returning in
     the triceps. At the end of a month the man left for England,
     with fair power in the triceps, but well-marked wrist-drop. A
     year later the wrist-drop still persisted.

     (120) Plexus injury.--Wound of entry, over pomum Adami;
     exit, below scapular spine, about centre. Complete median and
     musculo-spiral paralysis.

     (121) Median, musculo-cutaneous, and musculo-spiral
     nerves.--The wound traversed the axilla from just beneath the
     anterior fold; three weeks later a firm mass in the axilla
     corresponded to the wound track. Hyperæsthesia developed in the
     area of median distribution, with deep pain in the muscles.
     There was rigidity of the biceps cubiti and slight wasting in
     the radial extensors. The patient improved slowly, and
     eventually was discharged and passed out of sight.

     (122) Brachial nerves.--Wounded at Paardeberg. Range 500
     yards. Entry, at the front of the arm, 2 inches below the
     junction of the anterior axillary fold; exit, a little lower,
     at the back of the arm, in the line of junction of the
     posterior axillary fold.

     Considerable shock attended the primary injury; when reaction
     had taken place, complete motor and sensory paralysis was noted
     of the whole upper extremity, with the exception of some power
     of movement of the posterior interosseous group of muscles.
     Three weeks later the patient could extend the wrist, but
     sensation was imperfect in the arm, and completely absent in
     the forearm and hand. The track was now hard and palpable, but
     there was no hyperæsthesia in any area; when the track was
     manipulated slight formication in the hand was experienced. The
     biceps and triceps were equally paralysed. There was no wasting
     in any of the muscles.

     (123) Brachial nerves.--Wounded at Modder River. Entry,
     through the anterior axillary fold at its junction with the
     arm; exit, on the posterior wall of the thorax, 1/2 an inch
     from the median line at a level with the angle of the scapula.
     Complete musculo-spiral paralysis; hæmothorax. Three weeks
     later, radial sensation returned; but the triceps was very
     weak, and wrist-drop was complete. There was some wasting of
     the muscles supplied by the median and ulnar nerves, and
     complete obliteration of the radial pulse. A year later the
     musculo-spiral paralysis still persisted.

     (124) Musculo-spiral and median.--Wounded at Magersfontein.
     Entry, 3 inches below the anterior axillary fold, on the
     inner aspect of the arm; track passed obliquely downwards
     behind the humerus to a point on the outer aspect of the arm
     1-1/2 inch below the level of the entry. The humerus escaped
     injury. Musculo-spiral paralysis was complete; hyperæsthesia in
     the distribution of the median followed some days later. One
     month subsequently radial sensation had returned, and a feeling
     of numbness had taken the place of the median hyperæsthesia.
     The triceps and marginal muscles were much wasted, and only
     interosseous extension was possible in the fingers.

     (125) Brachial nerves.--Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry and
     exit, in the upper third of the arm internal to the humerus.
     Complete median paralysis, anæsthesia in the ulnar area, and in
     the radial supply to the dorsum of the middle and ring fingers.
     Could flex, extend, and adduct and abduct the wrist; some power
     of flexion in index finger, in others none. The flexion of the
     wrist was dependent on the ulnar supply to the muscles of the
     forearm. No wasting of the interossei, skin normal except for a
     large trophic blister on the dorsum of the hand. Little
     improvement had taken place in this patient at the end of a
     year.

     (126) Brachial nerves.--Wounded at Magersfontein. The wound
     traversed the lower part of the upper third of the arm,
     fracturing the humerus. Immediate complete loss of power in the
     arm was experienced, together with loss of all sensation. Three
     weeks later the humerus was united; the fracture was evidently
     the result of passing contact, and not of direct impact. The
     paralysis was still complete in the distribution of the median,
     ulnar, and musculo-spiral nerves. There was considerable
     wasting of the hand and forearm, and a good deal of thickening
     in the lower third of the arm.

     Four months after the original injury, the nerves were explored
     by Mr. Eve, who kindly gives me the following information. All
     the nerves and vessels of the arm were united into one firm
     bundle by cicatricial tissue. When dissected clear, the median
     nerve was found to be thickened and enlarged for about 1-1/2
     inch of its length; the ulnar was not completely freed, but was
     found to be continuous and indurated; the musculo-spiral was
     also intact, but at its entrance into the humeral groove a mass
     of callus was felt. A sclerosed and thickened portion of the
     median nerve 3-1/2 inches in length was resected, also 1 inch
     of sclerosed ulnar nerve, and both were sutured. The
     musculo-spiral nerve was left for future exploration. A small
     traumatic aneurism was found on the brachial artery, and the
     vessel was ligatured above it.

     Ten months later no improvement in the median or ulnar nerves.
     Electrical reaction present in musculo-spiral group of
     muscles.

     (127) Musculo-spiral.--Transverse wound through arm posterior
     to humerus. Slight suppuration. Triceps weakened only, complete
     paralysis of radial extensors and posterior interosseous group.
     Radial sensation lowered only.

     (128) Musculo-spiral.--Entry, 2 inches above and 1/2 an
     inch behind the external humeral condyle; exit, at the inner
     edge of the biceps, 1/2 an inch lower in the arm than the
     entry. It is doubtful whether the paralysis was noted at first,
     but a few days later complete posterior interosseous paralysis
     and lowered radial sensation were remarked. No change except a
     deepening of the anæsthesia, and the development of formication
     on manipulation of the wound occurred, and at the end of three
     weeks the nerve was exposed (Mr. Watson), and it was found that
     a notch had been cut in its outer border, which had opened out
     into a V shape. The margins of this notch were refreshed and
     the gap closed. Ten days later radial sensation was fairly
     good, but the motor symptoms remained unchanged. Nine months
     later steady but very slow improvement was reported.

     (129) Ulnar and musculo-cutaneous nerves.--Entry, back of
     forearm; the bullet passed between the bones and was retained
     at the posterior aspect of the arm. Three weeks later the hand
     was glossy and stiff, the fingers extended and adducted, the
     thumb was held stiffly in the palm with no power of extension.
     The forearm was held semiprone, and the elbow flexed by a rigid
     biceps. Six months later the same position was maintained, but
     the contracture disappeared under an anæsthetic.

     (130) Median and posterior interosseous.--Entry, over the
     external margin of the radius at the centre of the forearm;
     exit, at the inner margin of the olecranon 1-1/2 inch below
     the tip. Lowered cutaneous sensation in median distribution,
     and loss of median flexion of wrist and fingers. Complete
     wrist-drop. The triceps supinator longus and extensor carpi
     radialis longior were perfect. Twelve days later the wrist
     could be raised into a direct line with forearm, but there was
     no change in the median symptoms. A week after this the
     anæsthetic median area became hyperæsthetic both as to skin and
     on deep pressure over the muscles.

     (131) Sacral plexus. Great sciatic nerve.--Wounded at Modder
     River. Entry, in left loin; exit, at lower margin of
     buttock. The wound was followed immediately by complete
     peroneal paralysis, both motor and sensory. Fourteen days later
     hyperæsthesia developed in the area of distribution of the
     internal popliteal nerve, the superficial pain being greatest
     in the sole; the muscles of the calf were also very tender on
     manipulation. The pain increased, and at the end of twenty-four
     days the patient's sufferings were so great that Mr. Thornton
     cut down upon and exposed the nerve. It was found embedded in
     firm cicatricial tissue close to the sciatic notch; this
     compressed the nerve to such a degree that a waist was apparent
     upon it.

     The nerve was freed and resumed its normal outline. For a few
     days the patient was much relieved, but the neuralgia then
     returned in greater intensity than ever. Morphia was injected
     hypodermically, and other hypnotics employed, but with little
     effect, the patient developing the hysterical condition so
     common in the subjects of severe sciatica. Some five weeks
     later a sudden improvement took place, the morphia was
     decreased, and the patient became sufficiently well to return
     to England, but there was still deep tenderness in the calf,
     and well-marked hyperæsthesia of the sole.

     A year later the patient had been discharged from the Service,
     but was earning his living in a shop. He walked fairly well,
     but still with foot-drop, and complained of tenderness in the
     sole. I am indebted to Dr. Turney for the following report on
     the condition of the muscles.

     Calf muscles practically normal. In the anterior tibial and
     peroneal groups the faradic irritability is much diminished,
     that in the peroneus longus being the lowest of all.
     Contraction can be induced in the extensor longus hallucis,
     extensor longus digitorum, and peroneus brevis; but reaction is
     doubtful in the case of the tibialis anticus and peroneus
     longus.

     With the galvanic current contraction is sluggish, and the
     irritability diminished. No serious changes are present except
     in the peroneus longus. ACC > KCC at 10 M. A.

     (132) Great sciatic.--Entry, at outer aspect of the thigh,
     just above the centre; exit, at the junction of the inner and
     posterior aspects of thigh, about 2 inches lower. The wound was
     produced by a ricochet bullet, and beyond the perforation of
     the sciatic nerve the femur was fractured obliquely (see plate
     XVI.). Hyperæsthesia of the sole was noted early, and when I
     saw the patient three months later, there was wasting of the
     muscles of the leg, and foot-drop, although he walked with a
     stick.

     These symptoms persisted, and on his return to England an
     exploration was made by Sir Thomas Smith, and the two fragments
     of mantle seen in the skiagram were removed from the substance
     of the sciatic nerve. Eight months after the injury, the
     patient still walked with foot-drop; there was modified
     sensation in the musculo-cutaneous area, and a feeling as if
     the bones of the foot were uncovered when he walked. The
     circumference of the affected leg was more than 1 inch less
     than that of the sound one. Steady but slow improvement was
     taking place.

     (133) Great sciatic.--In a third patient with a buttock
     track, the symptoms were identical with those observed in case
     131. In this an exploration showed that the nerve had been
     perforated. Although the symptoms were never so severe as in
     No. 131, yet recovery was very much slower and less complete,
     the muscular weakness remained more marked, and the skin
     exhibited more evidence of trophic lesion. Some contracture of
     the knee and rigid foot-drop took place, and at the end of
     twelve months the patient walked poorly with a stick.
     Improvement is, however, continuing.

     (134) Great sciatic.--Wounded at Ladysmith. Entry,
     immediately below left buttock fold; exit, at anterior aspect
     of thigh, 3-1/2 inches below Poupart's ligament. The left leg
     was paralysed, and patient was sent down to the Base, where he
     remained two months. The wound closed by primary union, the
     paralysis improved, and the man rejoined his regiment. After he
     had been in camp four days, his leg gave way, and he returned
     to hospital, where he contracted enteric fever. Later, he was
     sent home, and eight months after the reception of the injury
     his condition was as follows:

     Left lower limb somewhat wasted, a diminution of 1 inch in the
     circumference of the leg and 1/2 an inch in the thigh being
     found. The patient walks with foot-drop, and the flexor muscles
     of the knee are weak. On examination the peroneal muscles
     reacted but sluggishly to faradic irritation. There is complete
     anæsthesia of the foot to above the ankle, and up to the knee
     tactile sensation and appreciation of pain were dulled. The
     left plantar reflex was absent, the right slight, the left
     patellar reflex was abnormally brisk. There was neither ankle
     nor patellar clonus, and the other reflexes were present and
     normal. The gait was spastic, and the patient was more troubled
     by a contraction of the calf muscles, which prevented his
     putting the heel to the ground, than by the foot-drop.

     Beyond these local phenomena there was marked tremor of the
     upper extremities on any exertion, and slight lateral
     nystagmus. The patient was not sure that this had not been
     present ever since he recovered from the enteric fever, but it
     was sufficiently marked to give rise to the suspicion of the
     development of disseminated sclerosis.

     The patient was a hard-headed, sensible man. He remained in the
     hospital under the care of Dr. Turney, to whom I am indebted
     for notes of the case, forty-six days. During this period he
     was treated by faradic electricity, and, with some checks,
     notably the development of passive effusion into the left
     knee-joint, and a fugitive attack of redness over the dorsum of
     the foot, both suggesting trophic changes, steadily improved.
     The anæsthesia became limited to the outer half of the leg, at
     the end of one month was limited to the dorsum of the foot
     only, and at the end of six weeks entirely disappeared.
     Meanwhile the tendency to drawing up of the heel by the calf
     muscles became less, and the gait improved. The man left the
     hospital at the end of two months, very satisfied with his
     condition, although the tremor of the hands was still present
     in a lessened degree.

     (135) External popliteal.--Wounded at Magersfontein, 250-300
     yards. Entry, at the outer side of the thigh, 5 inches above
     the lower extremity of the external condyle; exit, at the
     inner margin of the adductors, at a level 4 inches higher in
     the thigh. The track crossed behind the femur. Complete
     peroneal motor paralysis and anæsthesia, except in the hinder
     part of the region supplied by the mixed external saphenous.
     Slight hyperæsthesia of the sole. Improving at the end of three
     weeks, but paralysis still nearly complete.

     (136) External popliteal.--Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry,
     5 inches below the highest part of the right iliac crest, on
     outer aspect of hip; exit, at the posterior margin of the
     gracilis, 2 inches from the perineum. Complete peroneal
     paralysis followed, which rapidly improved, and on the
     twenty-second day was nearly well.

     (137) Internal popliteal. Secondary anæsthesia.--Shell
     wounds of the right popliteal space. Wounded at Belmont.
     Anæsthesia of the outer side of the calf, the leg and sole of
     foot. No motor paralysis. As cicatrisation progressed, the
     anæsthesia became more marked and was complete over the whole
     of the external saphenous area.

     (138) Internal popliteal.--Wounded at Paardeberg. 400-500
     yards. Entry, about the centre of the outer half of the
     patella; exit, at the centre of the calf, about 2 inches from
     the popliteal crease. Five days after the injury severe burning
     pain developed in the sole. A fortnight later the pain was much
     less severe, but varied in degree with the heat of the weather,
     being worse when cool. At this date, however, rubbing became
     comforting.

     (139) External popliteal.---Wounded at Magersfontein.
     Entry, 1 inch above the upper end of the internal margin of
     the patella; exit, at the margin of leg, just below the outer
     tuberosity of the tibia. Complete peroneal paralysis followed
     the injury. A month later the nerve was bared and found
     slightly thickened. An improvement in cutaneous sensation
     followed quickly, and a much slower improvement in the motor
     power commenced.

     (140) External popliteal nerve.--Wounded at Beacon Hill. A
     bayonet entered over upper quarter of fibula, and passed
     between the bones of leg into the calf. An aneurismal varix of
     the calf vessels developed, also incomplete peroneal paralysis.
     The scar was raised from the nerve (Major Simpson, R.A.M.C.)
     six weeks later, and at the end of a fortnight the power and
     sensation were both much improved and the patient returned to
     England.

     (141) External popliteal.--Wounded at Modder River. Entry,
     1/2 an inch above the internal border of the patella; exit,
     1-1/2 inch from the head of the fibula and over that bone. The
     wound was followed by peroneal paralysis. Six weeks later
     sensation was still diminished in the anterior tibial and
     musculo-cutaneous nerve areas, and marked foot-drop, little
     improved, persisted. The patient came to England, and at the
     end of twelve months is reported as very little improved.

     (142) Anterior tibial.--Entry, 1 inch in front and below
     the external malleolus; exit, at the centre of the sole, just
     anterior to the bases of the metatarsal bones. Wasting and
     paralysis of extensor brevis digitorum.

     (143) Small sciatic and small saphenous.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. 200 yards. Two wounds: (i) Entry, below the
     centre of the twelfth rib on the left side; exit, immediately
     to the left of the buttock furrow at upper part, (ii) Entry,
     in the right loin, midway between the last rib and iliac crest;
     exit, just within the centre of the left buttock; the two
     wounds crossed diagonally. Hyperæsthesia in area of
     distribution of small saphenous and small sciatic nerves, which
     rapidly improved.

     (144) Lumbar plexus.--Boer, wounded at Magersfontein.
     Entry, eleventh interspace, posterior axillary line; exit,
     tenth interspace, right mid-axillary line. Impaired sensation
     in area of distribution of external cutaneous and crural branch
     of genito-crural nerves. At the end of a fortnight anæsthesia
     was less apparent, but a feeling of numbness persisted, which
     soon disappeared.

Prognosis and treatment.--In considering the prognosis in cases of nerve injury, several of
the points already raised as to the nature of the lesion are of importance. Short of actual
section, it may be broadly stated that no lesion is too serious to render ultimate recovery
impossible.

In cases in which the injury has been produced by a bullet fired at a short range, or in which
contact with the nerve has been close, the return of functional activity is very slow. In such
instances the condition probably resembles that in which a divided nerve has been sutured,
with the additional disadvantage that a considerable portion of the nerve, both above and below
the point actually struck, has been destroyed as far as the conduction of nervous impulses
is concerned. This may reasonably be concluded in the light of the evidence offered by the
injuries of the spinal cord, in which several segments usually suffered if the velocity of
the bullet was great, and also if the fact is remembered that, when thickening takes place,
a considerable length of the nerve is usually implicated.

Recovery is notably slow in the case of certain nerves, e.g. musculo-spiral and peroneal, even
when the injury has not been of extreme severity. Again, these same nerves are apparently more
seriously affected by moderate degrees of damage than are others.

As favourable prognostic elements we may bear in mind: low velocity on the part of the travelling
bullet, and with this a lesser degree of contiguity of the track to the nerve. The early return
of sensation is a favourable sign, and in this relation the development of hyperæsthesia, whether
preceded by anæsthesia or no, points to the maintenance of continuity of, and a moderate degree
of damage to, the nerve. The early return of sensation, even if modified in acuteness, was
always a very hopeful sign; also the production of formication in the area of distribution
of the nerve on manipulation of the injured spot. As in the case of nerve injuries of every
nature, the disposition and temperament of the patient exerted considerable influence on the
course of the cases.

Complete section of the nerves in these bullet wounds only obtained special importance in two
ways: first, in that a considerable portion of the trunk might be shot away in oblique tracks,
and, secondly, in that very severe contusion might affect the nerve for a considerable distance
beyond the point actually implicated. In point of fact, complete section when treated by suture
was often more rapidly recovered from than an injury in which only a portion of the width of
a trunk was divided. This was no doubt to be explained on the theory that the contiguous portion
of the nerve suffered less when tension and resistance were lessened by complete severance
of the cord.

The treatment of slight nerve contusion was simple; rest alone was necessary, and in the course
of hours or days paralysis was recovered from. The symptoms were most troublesome in patients
of a neurotic temperament, or those who had suffered from severe systemic shock.

In severe concussions and contusions the first care had to be devoted to the discrimination
of the lesion from that of division. A period of rest then needed to be followed by one of
massage and movement, to maintain the nutrition of the muscles. In a considerable portion of
the cases a stage of neuritis had to be expected. In all cases, either of severe concussion,
contusion, or complete section, accompanied by the fracture of a bone, especial care was necessary
that the bandaging and fixation of the limb were not sufficiently tight to add the dangers
of muscular ischæmia to those of the nerve injury already present.

Neuritis, whether dependent on local injury, implication in the scar, pressure from callus,
or of the ascending variety, needed the same treatment: rest, preservation of the limb from
cold or damp, and the local application of anodynes, as belladonna, or hot laudanum fomentations.
In some cases a general anodyne, as morphia, was preferable; then always to be used with caution,
as the patients soon craved inordinately for it, and were unwilling to give it up. Later, local
blisters in the line of the nerve trunk, careful massage and exercise when muscular and cutaneous
tenderness had subsided, the application of the continuous current to the nerves, and perhaps
faradisation of the muscles, were all useful.

Splints were often temporarily required to resist contracture, or the assumption of false positions;
in either case they needed to be frequently removed, and movement &c. made, in order to avoid
any chance of troublesome stiffness.

Operative treatment.--Early interference was only warranted by positive knowledge that some
source of irritation or pressure could be removed; thus a bone spicule, or a bullet, or part
of one, particularly portions of mantles.

In case of contusion the expiration of three months is the earliest date at which any operation
should be taken into consideration, and interference is only then advisable if there is good
prospect of freeing the nerve from compressing adhesions. The two strongest indications for
operation are (1) signs pointing to the secondary implication of the nerve in a cicatrix, especially
when these are of such a nature as to indicate local tension, fixation, or pressure; (2) the
possibility of the irritation being the result of the presence of some foreign body, such as
a bone spicule, or portions of a bullet mantle; in such cases the X rays will often give useful
help.

With regard to the early exploration of cases of traumatic neuralgia, it may be pointed out
that when this was undertaken the results were as a rule very temporary. In many cases in which
the measure was resorted to, either no macroscopic evidence of injury to the nerve was discovered,
or a bulbous thickening was met with of such extent as to make excision inadvisable, even if
it were considered otherwise the most suitable treatment.

Even when complete section of the nerve was assured by the absence of any power of reaction
to stimulation by electricity from above on the part of the muscles, operation was better not
undertaken until cicatrisation had reached a certain stage. If done earlier than at the end
of three weeks, the sutured spot became implicated in a hard cicatrix, and any advantage to
be obtained by early interference was lost. When partial division of a trunk was determined,
the same date was the most favourable one for exploration, the gap in the nerve being freshened
and closed by suture. There is little doubt, however, that in some cases such injuries were
recovered from spontaneously.

In view of the uniformly bad results observed in the case of the seventh nerve, I am inclined
to think that the above rules might be tentatively relaxed, and the nerve primarily explored
by an operation resembling that for mastoid suppuration. It is of course doubtful whether the
trouble does not generally result from the vibratory concussion alone; but as this is not certain,
and the operation would only have to be performed on patients already permanently deaf, it
might be worth while at any rate opening the Fallopian canal with the object of relieving tension.
It is not probable that in any of the cases quoted much splintering of the bone had occurred,
as the wounds appeared to be of the nature of pure perforations.

CHAPTER X

INJURIES TO THE CHEST

In regard to Prognosis wounds of the chest furnished the most hopeful class of the whole series
of trunk or visceral injuries. Cases of wound of the heart and great vessels afforded the only
exceptions to an almost universally favourable course, both as regards life and the non-occurrence
of serious after-effects.

This was mainly explicable on two grounds: first, the sharply localised character of the lesion
produced by the bullet of small calibre; and, secondly, the fact that the lung, the most frequently
injured organ, is not materially affected by the grade of velocity with which the bullet strikes.
In point of fact, wounds of this organ probably afford an instance in which high grades of
velocity are distinctly favourable to the nature of the injury, and this is possibly true in
the case of wounds of the chest-wall also.

The significance of the calibre of the bullet in wounds of the chest is evident. The late Mr.
Archibald Forbes, in one of his letters from the seat of the Franco-German war, remarked that
in crossing a battlefield it was easy to recognise the patients who had suffered a wound of
the lung from the fact that the whistle of the air entering and leaving the chest was plainly
audible. This was, indeed, not uncommonly the case in wounds produced by the older bullets
of large calibre, but with the employment of the smaller projectile it has become an experience
of the past. Some evidence as to the comparative severity of wounds produced by the larger
forms of bullet was, moreover, afforded by the present campaign, since Martini-Henry wounds
were occasionally met with. Of some instances observed by myself, in one, external hæmorrhage
was a prominent symptom; in another, a piece of lung was prolapsed from a wound in the back,
and twice I observed pneumothorax, an uncommon sequela to wounds from bullets of small calibre.

It may be remarked, however, that all these more serious injuries were recovered from, also
that when we consider that the patients were comparatively young and healthy subjects, the
favourable prognosis was what might have reasonably been expected. When, as occasionally happened,
a patient of more mature years, with enlarged facial capillaries, received a wound of the lung,
the course was in no way so favourable as that witnessed in the case of the younger men.

In support of this opinion I may add that wounds from shrapnel and fragments of shell also
did remarkably well, although they sometimes gave rise to more troublesome symptoms than did
wounds produced by bullets of the Mauser type. Again, these injuries as a whole were of nothing
like so serious a nature as the lacerations of the lung produced by fractured ribs, which we
commonly have to treat in civil practice, and are not accustomed to regard as especially dangerous.

It is also a striking fact that the most common and troublesome complication of wounds of the
chest, hæmothorax, was usually the result of the wound of the chest-wall and not of the lung.
I preface these remarks to the detailed account of the thoracic injuries, because I think the
favourable course usually taken by patients with wounds of the lung has been accorded somewhat
greater prominence than the circumstances warranted.

Non-penetrating wounds of the chest-wall.--Surface wounds were not very common, and were chiefly
of interest in so far as they illustrated the very superficial course that may be occasionally
taken by a bullet without breach of the integument, and as sometimes affording opportunity
for the exercise of diagnostic skill when the track traversed the axilla.

The most common situation for tracks taking a long course on the surface of the thoracic skeleton
was the back. Such wounds were usually received while the patients were prone on the ground;
thus I might instance a case in which the bullet entered the posterior aspect of the shoulder
3 inches above the spine of the scapula, passed downwards, pierced that process, and emerged
2 inches below the inferior angle of the bone. Wounds of a similar nature coursing in transverse
and oblique directions, and not implicating bone, were also seen. Those implicating the vertebræ
have been already dealt with. The scapular region was also a favourite one for the lodgment
of retained bullets, some resting in the supra- and infra-spinatus muscles, others lying beneath
the bone itself.

On the anterior aspect of the chest, bullets coming from the front sometimes traversed and
fractured the clavicle, and then took a short course downwards, emerging over the ribs or sternum.
Figure 81 represents a particularly long track in this region. In other cases the precordial
region was crossed, but I never witnessed any serious effect on the heart's action in any such
injury at the time the patients came under my notice.

Wounds received with the arm outstretched and traversing the axilla sometimes gave considerable
trouble in excluding with certainty a perforation of the thoracic cavity. Thus a bullet entered
below the centre of the right clavicle and emerged 2-1/2 inches below, above the angle of the
scapula, at its axillary margin. The arm was outstretched at the moment of the reception of
the injury; but when the wound was viewed with the limb placed alongside the trunk, it seemed
almost impossible that the chest cavity could have escaped. In some cases of this kind the
difficulty was at once cleared up by noting evidence of injury to the axillary nerves.

A word will suffice as to the treatment of these wounds. The only special indication was to
keep the scapula at rest for a sufficient period. I have dealt with the anatomy of them at
such length only because in their extreme form they are so highly characteristic of the nature
of the injuries which may be produced by bullets of small calibre.

Penetrating wounds of the chest.--Tracks crossing the thoracic cavity in every direction were
common. When the erect attitude was maintained, frontal and sagittal wounds, pure or oblique,
were received; when the prone position was assumed, longitudinal tracks, either purely or obliquely
vertical, were the rule. Experience of wounds of the latter class was extensive in the present
campaign, from the fact that so many of the advances were made in prone or crawling attitudes.
The vertical and transverse tracks each possessed the special characteristic of frequently
implicating both the thoracic and abdominal cavities, but the vertical were often prolonged
into the neck, or even downwards through the pelvis. The vertical wounds in addition sometimes
exhibited one very important feature, the fracture of several ribs from within, often at a
very considerable distance from the aperture of either entry or exit.

Characters of the apertures of entry and exit.--As has already been mentioned, the chest-wall
was one of the situations in which the aperture of entry was often large, and the oval form
due to obliquity of impact on the part of the bullet was particularly well marked. The exit
wounds were often smaller than those of entry, especially if the bullet emerged by an intercostal
space; even when the ribs were comminuted, the fragments were, as a rule, too small to occasion
more than a slightly enlarged and irregular aperture. Taken as a class, however, and putting
aside explosive exit wounds, wounds of the chest afforded more numerous examples of irregular
outline and variation in size than were met with in any other region of the body.

When the tracks penetrated the broad upper intercostal spaces, an interesting feature, due
to the tense and rigid nature of the muscles closing the intervals, and their large admixture
of fibrous tissue, was sometimes noticed. The bullet, especially if passing obliquely, was
apt to cut a slit in the muscles far exceeding in size the opening in the overlying integument,
with the result of leaving a palpable subcutaneous defect. Under these circumstances the yielding
spot was often noticed to rise and fall with the movements of respiration, external palpation
met with an absence of normal resistance, and there was impulse on coughing.

Fractures of the ribs.--These injuries were produced in either transverse or longitudinal coursing
tracks, their special feature being a sharp localisation of the lesion of the bone.

In tracks crossing the chest transversely the injury to the ribs might consist in notching,
perforation, or complete solution of continuity, sometimes with fine comminution. In the incomplete
injuries some importance attached to the localisation of the lesion to the upper or lower border
of the rib, in so far as the intercostal artery was concerned. Comminution at the wound of
entry was, as a rule, not so extensive as at the aperture of exit, and in any case was less
apparent, since the fragments were driven inward. The wider comminution at the exit aperture
depends on the lesser degree of support afforded by the thoracic coverings to the convex outer
surface of the rib, and on the fact that the velocity of the bullet has been lowered by its
passage through the opposite rib and the chest cavity.

The splinters of comminuted ribs are small, and wide-reaching fissures rare. These characters
depend on the elastic nature of the resistance offered by the curved rib to the passage of
the bullet, which is calculated to preserve the bone from the full force of impact, except
at the point actually impinged upon.

Fractures of the ribs, produced from within by bullets taking a longitudinal course through
the thorax, were still more special in character. They were also more important, as giving
rise to troublesome symptoms.

In these, again, the degree of injury to the bones varied considerably. In some cases the bones
were merely grooved internally, without any external deformity; in other cases a sort of green-stick
fracture was produced, accompanied by the projection of a tender salient angle externally;
in others complete solution of continuity was effected.

Another feature of importance was the occasional implication of several ribs. In this case
the symptoms accompanying the injury were very much more like those observed in the corresponding
injuries resulting from indirect violence seen in civil practice.

Injuries to the costal cartilages closely resembled those to the ribs. Perforation, bending
from injury to the inner aspect, and comminution were observed. The latter condition differed
from the similar one seen in the case of the ribs only in so far as the tougher consistence
of the cartilage did not lend itself to such free comminution, and the splinters remained in
great part attached. The nature of the fractures, in fact, somewhat resembled that seen on
breaking a piece of cane.

I saw no fracture of the sternum except of the nature of a pure perforation; these were not
uncommon in the hospitals, either in the upper or the extreme lower portions of the bone. Fractures
in other portions were no doubt usually associated with fatal injuries to the heart. The openings
were usually so small as to be difficult of palpation, and I never had the opportunity of examining
one post mortem.

Perforations of the body of the scapula were common, but they were of little importance in
symptoms or prognosis.

Symptoms of fracture of the ribs.--Fractures accompanying transverse wounds of the chest were
characterised by the insignificance of the symptoms produced. Every common sign of fracture
of the rib was in fact absent. Neither pain, stitch on inspiration, nor crepitus, either audible
or palpable, was, as a rule, present. This absence of signs was accounted for by the nature
of the lesion: thus in perforations or notchings there was no loss of continuity, while in
the freely comminuted fractures the loss of continuity was so absolute as to allow no possibility
of the main fragments rubbing together. Again, part of the symptoms attending these injuries,
as seen in civil practice, depends upon contusion and laceration of the surrounding structures--a
condition precluded by the localised nature of the application of the violence by a bullet
of small calibre. In order to establish a diagnosis, therefore, we were in many cases reduced
to palpation, and occasionally to direct examination of the wound.

Fractures accompanying longitudinal tracks formed a class rather apart in the matter of symptoms.
In these mere groovings might also be accompanied by no signs, or at the most by slight local
pain and tenderness. When, however, the grooving was sufficiently deep to be accompanied by
deformity, or a complete solution of continuity was effected, the signs were often severe.
The tender salient angle, or, in the absence of this, a highly tender localised spot, often
pointed to the less severe injuries, and when the fractures were complete or multiple, pain
was a very prominent symptom, both constant and in the form of inspiratory stitch. The severity
of the pain was probably to be in part ascribed to implication of the intercostal nerves, which
in these injuries was direct and often multiple. Again, severe contusion or actual laceration
of the nerves, with resulting anæsthesia, was less common than when the bullet directly implicated
the nerves in transverse wounds. Free comminution and absolute solution of continuity were
also less common than in the fractures accompanying transverse wounds; hence pain from rubbing
of the fragments on inspiratory movement or palpation was more common, and crepitus, either
on auscultation or palpation, was more often met with. Patients with this class of fracture
often suffered greatly from painful dyspnoea, and were unable to assume the supine position.

External hæmorrhage of severity was rare from these thoracic wounds; in many cases it did not
amount to more than local staining of the shirt; altogether I saw only one or two cases where
any serious bleeding occurred. Internal hæmorrhage into the pleura, in consequence of the position
of the intercostal arteries, was common, and often abundant; this will be treated of under
the heading of hæmothorax.

Treatment of fractured ribs.--Transverse wounds of the thorax, with no symptoms of fractured
ribs, needed to be dealt with as wounds of the soft parts alone.

In multiple fractures accompanying longitudinal tracks, bandaging or strapping for the purpose
of fixation was necessary to relieve pain. A few fragments of bone sometimes needed primary
removal, and occasionally small sequestra were removed at a later date; but necrosis was rare,
unless some complication led to the development of a fistula.

Retained bullets were occasionally met with in the chest wall. In such cases the last remaining
energy of the bullet often seemed to have been spent in diving under the margin of a rib and
turning longitudinally up or down. Removal was sometimes necessary, either from the prominence
produced, the presence of pain, or the continuance of suppuration. Some of the specimens removed
offered interesting evidence of the capacity of the ribs to withstand considerable violence
from a bullet. These were slightly bent, and marked by a half-spiral groove. I saw such bullets
removed from the thoracic and the abdominal wall, and the evidence seemed rather against the
groove having been produced prior to their entrance into the body.

Wounds of the diaphragm.--Perforations of the diaphragm were very frequent, and as a rule of
small significance. When, however, the course taken by the bullet was parallel with that of
the slope of the diaphragm, a more or less extensive slit was the result. I saw such a wound
still gaping, and 2 inches in length, in the body of a patient who died three weeks after the
infliction of a fatal abdominal injury.

In several other obliquely transverse thoracic wounds there was reason to assume the existence
of similar slits. Certain signs were more or less constant under these circumstances. These
consisted in shallow respiration, often accompanied by a groan or the slightest degree of hiccough
on inspiration, and considerable increase in respiratory frequency. In one patient the respirations
were at first 48, only dropping to 36 some seventy hours after the reception of the injury.
In some of the cases in which the abdominal cavity was implicated, wound to the diaphragm seemed
a more likely explanation of early, frequent, and painful vomiting than did visceral injury.
The possibility of the later development of diaphragmatic herniæ in some of these patients
will have to be borne in mind in the future.

Visceral injuries.--The frequent escape of the thoracic viscera from injury, putting aside
the lungs which fill so great a part of the cavity, was very remarkable. I never saw a case
in which I could assume injury to any of the posterior mediastinal viscera, although such may
have occurred on the field of battle. An injury to the oesophagus, for instance, would almost
of necessity be accompanied by wound of either one of the large vessels, even the thoracic
aorta, or the spinal column. I was somewhat surprised, however, to learn on enquiry from surgeons
who had seen a large number of the dead and dying on the field, that thoracic wounds, putting
aside those that directly implicated the heart, were responsible for but a small proportion
of the fatalities.

The escape of the posterior mediastinal viscera, the great vessels, and the heart, is, I believe,
to be explained by the fact that all are supported and held in position by the loose meshed
mediastinal tissue, which allows for their displacement after the manner observed in the case
of the vessels and nerves lying in the loose tissue of the great vascular clefts.

Wounds of the heart.--Perforating wounds of the heart were probably fatal in all instances,
in spite of the fact that, in some patients who survived, the position of wound apertures on
the surface of the body made it difficult to believe that the heart had not been penetrated.
(See cases below.)

In the case of this organ, we must bear in mind its constant variations in bulk, its elastic
compressibility, and its variations in position in systole and diastole. The variations in
bulk and position would be capable of explaining the escape of the organ from injury at some
particular moment, when a second shot apparently through the same wound track might implicate
it. Beyond this, reasoning from the case of analogous hollow viscera, as the arteries or the
intestine, a bullet might readily score the surface of the heart without perforating its cavity.

Such accidents were observed. Thus, in a case examined by Mr. Cheatle, the patient died of
suppurative pericarditis, secondary to a wound of which the external apertures had closed.
In this patient both auricle and ventricle were scored externally by the passage of the bullet.

I am, however, disinclined to allow that many patients survived direct blows on the heart,
since I believe that in the majority if not in all cardiac wounds the actual cause of death
was not hæmorrhage, but sudden stoppage of the heart's action. This is to be inferred from
the fact that severe external hæmorrhage did not occur; in some cases the shirt was hardly
stained, and in all death occurred in the course of a very few minutes. Again, in none of the
patients whom I saw who had received possible wounds of the heart-wall were there evident signs
of hæmo-pericardium. In view of the difficulty of detecting this condition from physical signs,
this argument is naturally not of great weight, but must be allowed.

One or two death scenes from cardiac wound were described to me. In one the patient muttered
'They have got me this time,' and died quietly; in a second the patient's face became ghastly
pale, he lay on his back with the knees flexed, clutching the ground, gasping for breath, and
died only after some minutes of evident great agony. The absence of any post-mortem details
as to the condition of the heart in these injuries is much to be regretted.

     (145) Entry, in the seventh left intercostal space, in the
     posterior axillary line; exit, immediately below the ninth
     costal cartilage, close to the position of the gall bladder.

     This track in all probability involved the diaphragm twice,
     both lungs and pleuræ, and passed immediately beneath the
     heart. The liver was also perforated, but the spleen and
     stomach probably escaped as far as could be judged from the
     symptoms. The patient afterwards developed a pneumo-hæmo-thorax
     on the right side. The immediate symptoms were great distress
     in breathing and rapid irregular pulse. The difficulty in
     respiration was probably in part accounted for by the injuries
     to the lung and diaphragm. The pulse remained from 112 to 120
     for three days, at first soft and hardly perceptible, later
     very irregular, and dropping one every fifth or sixth beat; and
     it seemed fair to attribute this to the shock to the nervous
     mechanism of the heart. The patient recovered from the chest
     injury.

     In some other patients in whom the track passed close below the
     heart a disturbance of the pulse rate was noted, but this was
     in some cases a slowing, not below 48, in others quickening to
     100, with irregularity both in force and beat.

     (146) Entry, in the fourth right interspace, 3 inches from
     the middle line; exit, in the seventh left interspace, in the
     mid-axillary line. This wound was received at a distance of
     500-600 yards, but the bullet penetrated both sides of a stout
     silver cigarette case and some cigarettes before entering the
     body. There were minor signs of pulmonary injury, 'coughing day
     and night,' and slight discoloration of the sputum on three or
     four occasions. The respirations were quickened to 32, and as
     much as ten days after the injury the pulse only beat 48 to the
     minute; it then rose to 56, but beat in a very deliberate
     manner.

In other cases the signs were almost nil.

     (147) Entry, in the fourth right intercostal space 3/4 of an
     inch from the sternum; exit, in the sixth left interspace in
     the posterior axillary line. This patient had no symptoms,
     beyond quickening of the pulse to 100, and a 'feeling of
     tightness at the heart.' He shortly returned to active duty.

     (148) Entry, situated in the third right interspace 3 inches
     from the sternal margin; exit, in the fourth left space 2-3/4
     inches from the sternal margin. In this case the bullet without
     doubt passed through the anterior mediastinum, and slight
     injury to the lung was evidenced by transient hæmoptysis.

Some remarks regarding wounds of the thoracic vessels have already been made in Chapter IV.,
where instances of injury to the innominate and left subclavian arteries are recounted. The
escape of the large trunks was generally quite as astonishing as in other parts of the body,
especially in the superior mediastinum.

     (149) Entry, over the first right intercostal space beneath
     the centre of the clavicle; exit, at left anterior axillary
     fold. The great vessels must have been crossed here in
     immediate contact, and considerable hæmorrhage from the wound
     of entry caused great anxiety; this ceased spontaneously,
     however, and, beyond transient hæmoptysis and a right
     pneumo-thorax, no further trouble occurred.

     (150) Entry, in the ninth interspace, just anterior to the
     anterior axillary line; exit, through the right half of the
     sternum, 1/2 an inch below the upper border. No primary
     hæmorrhage of importance followed, but I believe this patient
     subsequently died. The wound was received at a range of within
     fifty yards.

Wounds of the lungs.--Numerically, pulmonary wounds formed the most important series of visceral
injuries met with in the thorax, the frequency of incidence corresponding with the proportionate
sectional area occupied by the organs. Although these injuries did well, and needed little
interference on the part of the surgeon, many points of interest were raised by them.

Thus the comparative importance of the wound in the chest-wall to that in the lung itself,
was scarcely what, without actual experience, would have been expected, the former proving
so very much the more important element of the two.

The question of velocity on the part of the bullet took a very secondary position in these
injuries. I saw a number of cases in which the patients estimated the range at which they received
their wounds as from 30 to 50 yards, and although some of the wounds were of a severe type,
the increased gravity depended rather on the injury to the chest-wall than to that of the lung.
If the bullet passed by the intercostal space, avoiding the rib, I very much doubt if the relative
velocity was of any importance, further than from the fact that a sufficiently low degree to
allow of lodgment of the bullet was distinctly unfavourable.

In view of the general lack of significance in these injuries it was interesting to note how
very definite was the ill effect of early transport on the after course. This depended on the
frequent development of parietal hæmothorax in patients who were not kept absolutely at rest.

The tracks produced in the lungs by the bullets were very minute, and in the few cases in which
opportunity arose for their examination post mortem some little time after the infliction of
the wound, there was great difficulty in localising them. The slight damage incurred by the
pulmonary tissue is due to its elasticity and non-resistent character.

Pulmonary hæmothorax was distinctly rare. Reasoning from the analogous wounds of the liver,
tracks scoring the surface of these organs might be much more to be feared than clean perforations.
The elasticity of the lung tissue, however, must make such lesions rare. In point of fact,
there is no reason why a perforation by a bullet of small calibre should be much more feared
than a puncture from an exploring trocar, and the danger of the two wounds is probably very
nearly the same.

The only points of importance as to the particular region of the lung traversed were the distance
from the periphery as affecting the probable size of the vessels injured, and perhaps the implication
of the base or apex of the organ respectively. I am under the impression that wounds in the
apical region were somewhat more liable to be followed by the development of pneumothorax,
and possibly hæmothorax, while wounds at the base gained their chief importance from the frequency
of concurrent injury to the abdominal viscera. I had no experience of the immediate results
of wound of the great vessels at the root of the lung, but assume that they led to speedy death.

Symptoms of wound of the lung.--I shall describe the whole complex usually observed, although
it is obvious that the wound of the chest-wall is responsible for a large proportion of the signs.

The majority of these injuries were accompanied by a certain degree of systemic shock, and
this was more marked in wounds received at a short range. The shock was, however, rather to
be attributed to the injury to the chest-wall and thoracic concussion than to that to the lung
itself. I think it may also be stated that few patients were inclined to walk or remain in
the erect position after receiving these wounds; this feature was also noted in horses in whom
a bullet passed through the lungs.

The remarks made as to the pain accompanying fractures of the ribs apply equally here. Pain
was not a prominent symptom, except in so far as the actual impact caused temporary suffering.
It was striking how often patients who received wounds through the arm prior to the same bullet
traversing the chest appreciated the chest wound only, yet the chest might pass unnoticed when
a still more sensitive part was struck later, as has been already mentioned in the section
on wounds in general.

Dyspnoea was not a prominent primary symptom. The patients sometimes had 'all the wind knocked
out of them' at the moment of impact, but when seen at the Field hospitals a short time later,
the respirations were shallow, but easy and regular, and only moderately quickened; thus 24
was a not uncommon rate. Naturally if accumulation of blood in the pleura began early and continued,
these remarks do not hold good; and again in some older men of full-blooded type and the subjects
of recurrent attacks of bronchitis, a considerable degree of pain, dyspnoea, and even cyanosis
was sometimes present soon after the injury. The complication of wound of the diaphragm has
already been referred to in this relation.

Local respiratory immobility of the thoracic parietes and consequent asymmetry of movement
were constant. This was especially a marked feature when the upper part of the chest was implicated
on one side only. It rather corresponded, however, to the local shock observed in wounds of
the limbs than to the instinctive immobility accompanying fractures of the ribs; since, as
already explained, small-calibre bullet wounds of the ribs are not necessarily painful on movement,
and the sign existed even when the bullet had passed by an intercostal space. This sign was
naturally a transitory one.

Hæmoptysis was a fairly constant sign, but sometimes quite absent when no doubt could exist
as to the perforation of the lung. As a rule, a considerable quantity of blood might be coughed
up shortly after the injury; but I never knew this to be sufficient in amount to give rise
to any misgivings as to danger from the hæmorrhage. After the first evacuation of blood from
the wounded lung, the sign varied much; in the majority of instances the patients continued
to expectorate small quantities of blood mixed with mucus, for some three or four days, the
blood gradually assuming a coagulated condition. Sometimes only the primary hæmoptysis was
noted, and still more rarely the expectoration of clots was continued for a week, or even longer.
This probably depended partly on personal idiosyncrasy, partly on the size of the vessels which
had been implicated in the track.

Cough was not commonly the troublesome symptom noted in the contused wounds of the lung seen
in civil practice accompanying fracture of the ribs. Moist sounds were usually audible on auscultation,
but in many cases over a very limited area and only on the first few days.

Cellular emphysema was distinctly rare, and usually limited in extent: thus I saw it in the
posterior triangle of the neck alone in an apical wound; over about a third of the upper part
of the thorax in another wound through the second intercostal space, and in this case oddly
enough the emphysema was the only sign of injury to the lung; and very occasionally widely
distributed--in the latter case there were also usually multiple fractures of the ribs. Neither
issue of air from the external wound nor frothy blood was ever seen with small-calibre wounds,
but I saw one instance in a case of Martini-Henry wound.

Pneumothorax was also rare. I saw pneumothorax three times out of about half a dozen Martini-Henry
wounds, but I do not think it occurred as often in 100 small-calibre wounds. The Martini-Henry
wounds all recovered; but convalescence was very prolonged, and the same remark to a less degree
holds good in the small-calibre cases.

That the slow recovery in cases of pneumothorax in the Martini-Henry wounds was due mainly
to the size of the opening in the thoracic parietes was, I think, proved by the fact that in
the small-calibre bullet wounds, followed by the development of pneumothorax, the external
wounds were usually large and irregular in type; also, that in the only pneumothorax which
I saw produced during an extraction operation, the air was very rapidly absorbed. In the latter
case, however, there was little reason to conclude that wound of the lung had occurred primarily,
and certainly no opening existed at the time the thorax was incised.

Hæmothorax.--This was the most frequent and also the most interesting of the complications
of wound of the chest. In 90 per cent. or more of the cases, the hæmorrhage was of parietal
source, and due either to direct injury to the intercostal vessels by the bullet or to laceration
by spicules of comminuted ribs. For this reason, the passage of the bullet whether by an intercostal
space, or through a rib, provided the wound was not at the posterior part of the space where
the artery crosses, was a point of considerable prognostic importance. Exclusion of the lung
as the source of hæmorrhage was, I think, amply justified by the absence of continuous recurrent
or progressive hæmoptysis in the majority of the cases, and by the very small trace of injury
found in the lungs of patients who died some weeks after the injury. In such it was difficult
to discriminate the tracks at all. I only happened to see one case where free hæmoptysis, during
the course of development of a hæmothorax, pointed to the lung as the source of the blood.

Hæmorrhage into the pleural cavity occurred in some degree in a very large proportion of the
chest wounds, but it was especially interesting to note how greatly its extent was influenced
by the amount of transport to which the patients were subjected in the early stages after the
injury. During the early part of the campaign, on the western side, I saw a large number of
chest wounds, and had I been asked my opinion as to the relative frequency of occurrence of
hæmothorax I should have placed it at about 30 per cent. The patients in these early battles
needed little wagon transport, and when sent down to the Base travelled in comfortable ambulance
trains. After the commencement of the march from Modder River to Bloemfontein, however, these
conditions were changed, and all the chest as other cases were exposed to the necessity of
three days and nights' journey to the Stationary hospitals and afterwards to the long journey
to Cape Town. Of these patients, at least 90 per cent. suffered with hæmothorax of varying
degrees of severity.

In some cases, the least common, signs of considerable intra-pleural hæmorrhage immediately
followed the wound; in others, the accumulation of blood was gradual, and only manifest in
any degree at the end of three or four days, when it became stationary if the patient was kept
at rest. In a second series the hæmorrhage was of the recurrent variety; these cases differing
little in character from those of slight continuous hæmorrhage. In a third, the bleeding was
definitely of a secondary character, corresponding with one of the classes of secondary hæmorrhage
described in Chapter IV., and occurring on the eighth or tenth day from giving way of an imperfectly
closed wounded vessel. In either of the two latter classes the development of the hæmothorax
often corresponded with a journey, or with allowing the patient to get up.

The general course of these effusions was towards spontaneous absorption and recovery. Coagulation
of the blood took place early, the fluid serum separated, and tended to undergo absorption
with some rapidity, leaving a small amount of coagulum at the base, which evidenced its presence
for many weeks by a persistence of a certain degree of dulness on percussion. Early coagulation,
I think, accounted for the usual absence of gravitation ecchymosis as a sign.

The course to recovery was sometimes broken by signs of slight pleuritic inflammation, which,
as affecting the amount of effusion, will be spoken of under the heading of symptoms. In some
cases the amount of blood was so great as to necessitate means being taken for its removal;
in these a reaccumulation often took place. Occasionally an empyema followed in cases thus treated.

The nature of the blood evacuated on tapping varied much. In very early aspirations unchanged
blood was often met with, but clot sometimes made evacuation difficult and necessitated a second
puncture. In the tappings done at the end of a week or more a dark porter-like fluid was common,
while when suppuration was imminent a brick-red-coloured grumous fluid replaced normal blood.
In the cases where early incision was resorted to, blood both fluid and in clots was often
mixed with a certain proportion of lymph flakes, perhaps indicating the part taken by inflammatory
reaction to the irritation of the clot in producing the rise of temperature.

Symptoms of hæmothorax.--In the more severe cases of primary bleeding the symptoms did not,
as a rule, reach their full height until the third or fourth day after the injury. The patients
then often suffered severely. The pulse and temperature rose, and to general symptoms of loss
of blood were added: occasional lividity of countenance; severe dyspnoea, accompanied by inability
to lie on the sound side or to assume the supine position; absence of respiratory movement
on the injured side; pain, restlessness, cough, and sometimes continuance of hæmoptysis, small
clots usually being expectorated.

Accompanying these symptoms were the usual physical signs of fluid in the pleura in differing
degrees and combination. Dulness of varying extent up to complete absence of resonance on one
side, often accompanied in the incomplete cases by well-marked skodaic resonance anteriorly.
Loss of vocal resonance, and fremitus; oegophony, tubular respiration over the root of the
lung or at the upper limit of the dulness, and more or less extensive displacement of the heart.
Obvious increase in girth, fulness of the intercostal spaces, or gravitation ecchymosis was
rare. The latter was most common in instances in which multiple fracture of the ribs existed
(see fig. 83). I think the rarity of the last sign must have been due to the early coagulation
of the blood, and its retention by the pleura, as I saw well-marked gravitation ecchymosis
in one or two cases of mediastinal hæmorrhage.

The above complex of symptoms was common to all the cases, but in the slighter ones they gave
rise to little trouble, and cleared up with great rapidity.

The most interesting feature was offered by the temperature, as this was very liable to lead
one astray. A primary rise always occurred with the collection of blood in the pleura, this
reaching its height on the third or fourth day, usually about 102° F. in well-marked cases;
it then fell, and in favourable instances remained normal. In a large number of cases, however,
where the amount of blood was considerable, this was not the case, the primary fall not reaching
the normal, and a second rise occurred which reached the same height as before or higher. The
second rise was accompanied by sweating, quickened pulse, and the probability of the development
of an empyema had always to be considered. I believe in most cases this secondary rise was
an indication of a further increase in the hæmorrhage, for the dulness usually increased in
extent, and such rises were often seen when the patient had been moved or taken a journey.
Again, the temperature often fell to normal after paracentesis and removal of the blood, to
rise again with a fresh accumulation, which was not uncommon. I have already mentioned the
large proportional incidence of hæmothorax observed in the patients who had to travel down
from Paardeberg, and I might instance another case related to me by Dr. Flockemann of the German
ambulance, which was very striking. A Boer, wounded at Colesberg, developed a hæmothorax which
quieted down, and he was removed to Bloemfontein; on arrival at the latter place the temperature
rose, and other signs of fever suggested the development of an empyema; an exploring needle,
however, only brought blood to light. After a short stay at Bloemfontein the symptoms entirely
subsided, and the man was sent to Kroonstadt, when an exactly similar attack resulted, again
quieting down with rest.

Similar recurrent attacks of hæmorrhage and fever occurred, however, in patients confined to
their beds without moving after the first journey. Some temperature charts, in illustration
of this point, are added to the cases quoted later. The explanation of the recurrent hæmorrhages
is, I think, to be found in the reduction of the intra-thoracic pressure with coagulation and
shrinkage of the clot in the pleura in the patients kept quiet in bed, while in the patients
who had to travel it was probably the result of direct mechanical disturbance.

In many of these cases a pleural rub was audible at the upper margin of the dulness with the
development of the fresh symptoms. Whether this was due to actual pleurisy or to the rubbing
of surfaces rough from the breaking down of slight recent adhesions which had formed a barrier
to the effusion, I am unable to say, but the signs were fairly constant. In some instances
the increase in the amount of fluid was, no doubt, due to pleural effusion resulting from irritation
from the presence of blood-clot, or perhaps the shifting of the latter; in these the secondary
rise of temperature may well be ascribed to the development of pleurisy.

I am inclined to believe, however, that the primary rise of temperature was similar to that
seen when blood accumulates in the peritoneal cavity as the result of trauma, and the secondary
rises in most cases to those which we saw so frequently accompanying the interstitial secondary
hæmorrhages spoken of in Chapter IV., and are to be explained on the theory of absorption of
a blood ferment. The secondary rises always occurred with a fresh effusion, often of blood,
occasioning an extension, which broke down probable light adhesions and exposed a fresh area
of normal pleural membrane to act as a surface for absorption.

It is, of course, manifest that the fever might also be ascribed to the infection of the clot
or serum from without, and in the first cases I saw I was inclined to take this view, since
we had in every case the primary wounds of chest-wall, and possibly of lung, and in some the
addition of a puncture by an exploring needle between the first and second rise. After a wider
experience, however, I abandoned the infection theory, as it seemed opposed by the very infrequent
sequence of suppuration. The effect of simple removal of the blood or serum was also often
so striking as to strongly suggest that it alone was responsible for the fever. Exactly the
same result, moreover, followed evacuation of the interstitial blood effusions already mentioned
elsewhere.

The common course of all the cases of hæmothorax was to spontaneous recovery, the rapidity
of the subsidence of the signs depending mainly on the quantity of the primary hæmorrhage,
and the occurrence of further increases. The blood serum tended to collect at the upper limit
of the original blood effusion (as was often proved on tapping), and this was first absorbed;
the clot deposited on the pleural surface and at the basal part of the cavity was, however,
not absorbed with the same rapidity. In the majority of the patients when they left the hospitals,
at the end of six weeks on an average, some dulness and deficiency of vesicular murmur always
remained, and the clot and the surrounding surface, irritated by its presence, will, no doubt,
be responsible for permanent adhesions in many cases. That such adhesions do form in the majority
of cases I feel certain, as, although these patients when they left the hospital were to all
intents and purposes apparently well, few of them could undertake sustained exertion without
getting short of breath, and sometimes suffering from transitory pain, and for this reason
it became customary to invalid them home.

In a small proportion of the cases empyema followed; but I never saw this in any case that
had neither been tapped nor opened, and I saw only one patient die from a chest wound uncomplicated
by other injuries. This case was an interesting one of recurrent hæmorrhage followed by inflammatory
troubles:--

     (151) The wound was received at short range, probably at from
     100 to 200 yards. Entry, 1 inch from the left axillary margin
     in the first intercostal space; exit, at the back of the
     right arm 1-1/2 inch below the acromial angle; both pleuræ were
     therefore crossed. The patient expectorated at first fluid,
     then clotted, blood in considerable quantity. When brought into
     the advanced Base hospital on the third day, there were signs
     of blood in the left pleura, cellular emphysema over the right
     side of the chest, and signs of collapse of the right lung. The
     temperature chart gives shortly the course of the case: the
     right pneumo-thorax cleared up spontaneously, also the
     emphysema; but the left pleura needed tapping to relieve
     symptoms of pressure on four occasions, the 13th, 15th, 19th,
     and 25th days respectively. On the first two occasions blood
     was removed, on the third blood serum only, and on the last
     pus. The patient was relieved after each aspiration; after the
     third, the temperature fell to normal, the general condition
     also improved, and he promised to do well. None the less,
     reaccumulation took place, the evacuated fluid assumed an
     inflammatory character, and an incision to evacuate pus was
     eventually followed by death on the twenty-seventh day. The
     amount of hæmoptysis throughout was considerable, and the case
     was possibly one of pulmonary hæmothorax, as after death no
     source of hæmorrhage could be localised in the intercostal
     space. The track in the lung was almost healed, and although a
     part of it allowed the introduction of a probe for about an
     inch, it could be traced no further even on section of the
     organ, and no special vessel could be located as the original
     bleeding spot.

Empyema.--I may here add the little that I have to say on this subject. During the whole campaign
the single case of primary empyema that I saw was the one recorded below, which deserves special
mention as illustrating the disadvantage of extracting bullets on the field. Under the conditions
which necessarily accompanied this operation the ensurance of asepsis was impossible, and the
additional wound no doubt proved the source of infection.

     (152) Entry, at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid
     muscle, 2 inches above the clavicle; the bullet came to the
     surface beneath the skin over the fifth rib, in the nipple line
     of the right side. There was never any hæmoptysis, but the
     patient suffered with some dyspnoea throughout. After a three
     days' stay in the Field hospital, where the subcutaneous bullet
     was removed, the patient was transported by wagon and train to
     the Base, a journey of about 600 miles.

     On the fifth day pus escaped from the extraction wound, and
     when the case was examined at the Base, the temperature was
     101°, the pulse over 100, the respirations 30, and the whole
     side of the chest was dull, with the exception of a patch of
     boxy resonance over the apex anteriorly. On the following day
     the chest was drained, and a considerable amount of pus
     evacuated, which was mixed with breaking-down blood-clot. A
     fortnight later a second operation had to be performed to
     improve the drainage, and the patient made a tedious recovery.

The following case well illustrates the symptoms in a severe case of hæmothorax, and empyema
following aspiration:--

     (153) The patient was wounded at Paardeberg at a range of from
     500 to 700 yards. Entry, just to the left of the episternal
     notch; exit, in the fifth left interspace posteriorly, midway
     between the spine and vertebral margin of the scapula. A
     quantity of bright blood was brought up at once, and later
     blood was coughed up in clots.

     There was no great pain at the moment of the injury; the man
     again got up to the firing line, and later walked two miles to
     the Field hospital without aid. He remained here a week, when
     he was sent down to the Base, and during the first three days'
     journey in the wagon he began to get worse. On the fourth day
     cough began to be very troublesome.

     When he arrived at the Base, fifteen days after the original
     injury, there was much dyspnoea; the temperature was 102°,
     and the pulse 110. The left side of the chest was dull
     throughout; an aspirating needle was introduced, and a pint of
     very dark liquid blood drawn off. The whole of the blood was
     not removed on account of the very severe cough and pain which
     the evacuation occasioned. The man appeared to steadily improve
     until three weeks later, when the temperature, which throughout
     had been uneven, became consistently high, and signs of fluid
     at the base increased. An aspirating needle was introduced, and
     16 ounces of pus were drawn off. Two days later a piece of rib
     was resected (Mr. Pegg) and another pint of pus evacuated.
     After this, rapid improvement took place, and in ten days the
     man was able to be up and dressed, although a small amount of
     discharge still persisted. He eventually made an excellent
     recovery.

Secondary empyemata not uncommonly followed incision of the chest, or excision of a rib for
draining a hæmothorax. These operations in the early part of the campaign were more freely
undertaken on the supposition that rise of temperature and other symptoms of fever pointed
to incipient breaking down of the clot. Subsequent experience showed this not to be the case,
and early operations for drainage ceased to be undertaken. In these operations a primary difficulty
was met with in effectively clearing out the clot, a drain had to be left, and suppuration
occurred later in a considerable proportion. The suppurations were most troublesome; local
adhesions formed, and the pus collected in small pockets, which were difficult to find and
to drain, and even when the collections seemed to have been successfully dealt with at the
time, residual abscesses often followed at a very late date. Thus, I saw a case with a contracted
chest and a fresh abscess the day before I left Cape Town, in whom I had advised and witnessed
an operation for the evacuation of clot in the presence of signs of fever a week after my arrival
in the country, nine months previously. I saw another case where general infection followed
incision of a hæmothorax, but the patient fortunately recovered.

The question of pleurisy has already been mentioned in connection with hæmothorax; it no doubt
accounted for secondary effusion in some cases, and beyond this I have nothing to add to what
has been there said.

Pneumonia was rare; there were occasionally signs of consolidation, but, I think, quite as
often in the opposite lung as in the one injured. I never saw a fatal case, and I am inclined
to think that when it occurred it was as often the result of cold and exposure as of the injury
to the lung. Abscess of the lung I only saw once, and that in a case in which the injury to
the chest was complicated by paraplegia from spinal injury and septicæmia, and it was possibly
pyæmic.

Diagnosis.--No difficulties special to small-calibre wounds were experienced, except such as
have been already dealt with. The only class of case which frequently gave rise to difficulty
was hæmothorax. Here two points especially needed consideration. (1) The source of the hæmorrhage
as parietal or visceral. As has been already foreshadowed, this was mainly to be decided by
the amount and persistence of the hæmoptysis, but naturally free hæmoptysis did not negative
concurrent parietal bleeding. Then the actual source of the bleeding other than from the lung
had to be considered; in the great majority of cases the intercostal vessels were responsible,
and attention to the course of the tracks often allowed this to be definitely decided upon.

A case included in the chapter on Injuries to the Blood Vessels (No. 5, p. 127) is of great
interest in this particular; in that instance feebleness of the radial pulse, together with
the position of the wound, was a valuable indication of injury to the subclavian artery, but
weakened somewhat by the fact of retention of the bullet, and hence uncertainty as to the exact
course that it had taken, and as to whether the bullet itself was not responsible for pressure
on the vessel. Such indications, however, should make one very chary of interference with a
hæmothorax, even with extremely urgent symptoms, in the light of our present knowledge of the
nature of the lesions to the great vessels produced by small-calibre bullets, and their tendency
to be incomplete.

(2) The imminence of suppuration or its actual occurrence.--In most cases it sufficed to preserve
an expectant attitude, and in the persistence or increase of symptoms, to have recourse to
an exploratory puncture as the best means of solution of the difficulty.

Prognosis.--The prognosis both as to life and as to subsequent ill-effects was remarkably good;
in many cases of uncomplicated injury to the lung the patients rejoined their regiments at
the end of a month or six weeks. In the more serious cases complicated by the collection of
blood in the pleura, convalescence was more prolonged, and an average time of six to eight
weeks often elapsed before the patients could be safely discharged from hospital. In the more
serious a certain amount of dulness always persisted at this time over the base of the lung,
and the chest was usually somewhat contracted on the injured side, with evidence in the way
of decreased vesicular murmur that the lung was still not free from compression. With regard
to the persistence of dulness on percussion, it is well to bear in mind that a thin layer of
blood apparently produces as serious impairment of resonance as a much larger quantity of serum.
The signs appeared to favour the view that the space necessary for the location of the hæmorrhage
had been obtained at the expense of the lung rather than by distension of the thoracic parietes,
and also, I think, denoted the presence of adhesions. Possibly they will entirely disappear
with the return of full excursion movements of respiration, the latter being often still somewhat
restricted when the patients left hospital. All the patients with such signs were liable to
attacks of pain and shortness of breath on actual bodily exertion. I happened to meet with
an officer, the subject of a Lee-Metford wound of the thorax, sustained five years previously,
and he told me that he was nine months before he could take active exercise without feeling
short of breath.

As to the cases of hæmothorax and empyema which needed drainage, all did well; but expansion
of the lung was much less satisfactory than would have been expected, probably on account of
especially firm adhesions. The importance of concurrent injury I need hardly dwell on; but
I might add that perforation of one or both arms, the most common one, did not materially affect
the general statements above made.

Treatment.--In the early stages of the pulmonary wounds rest was the all-important indication,
and when this was assured few serious cases of hæmothorax occurred. Beyond simple rest, the
administration of opium with a view to checking internal hæmorrhage was used with good effect.
The wounds needed simple dressing only.

The treatment of hæmothorax at a later date, however, was of much interest and difficulty.
I think the following lines may be laid down for guidance in such cases:--

(i) Hæmothorax, even of considerable severity, will undergo spontaneous cure. An early rise
of temperature may be disregarded.

(ii) Tapping the chest is indicated when pressure signs on the lung are sufficiently severe
to cause serious symptoms, and the removal of the blood undoubtedly shortens the period of
recovery, as well as relieves symptoms.

In such cases the collection of blood has usually been rapid and continuous; hence a fresh
hæmorrhage is always probable when the local pressure has been removed. Tapping therefore should
not necessarily mean complete evacuation, and should be followed by careful firm binding up
of the chest, the administration of opium, and the most stringent precautions for rest.

(iii) Tapping may be needed as a diagnostic aid, and in such circumstances as much fluid as
can be removed should be evacuated with the same precautions as mentioned in the last paragraph.

(iv) Tapping may be indicated for the evacuation of serum expressed from the blood-clot, or
due to pleural effusion, on the same lines as in any other collection of fluid in the pleural
cavity.

(v) Early free incision is, as a rule, to be steadfastly avoided. Some cases already quoted
fully illustrate its disadvantages.

(vi) Cases in which an incision and the ligature of a parietal artery are indicated are very
rare. I never saw such a one myself.

(vii) If a hæmothorax suppurates, it must be treated on the ordinary lines of an empyema. In
view of the constant formation of adhesions and difficulty in drainage, a portion of a rib
should always be resected in order to ensure sufficient space for after-treatment. The cavities,
as a rule, are better irrigated, the usual precautions being taken where there is any reason
to fear that the lung is still in communication with the cavity.

Care in carrying out asepsis in tapping, which should be performed with an aspirator, need
hardly be more than mentioned. It will be noted that in some of the cases quoted suppuration
followed tapping, but it must be remembered that in these the two primary wounds already existed
as possible channels of infection.

Retained bullets of small calibre in the thoracic cavity were not common, unless the lodgment
had occurred in the bodies of the vertebræ. I saw very few. Shrapnel bullets and fragments
of shells, however, were, in proportion to the frequency of wounds from such projectiles, more
commonly retained. The rules to be followed in such cases do not materially deviate from those
to be observed in the body generally.

When the bullet is causing no trouble, and is lodged in either the bone of the spine or the
lung substance, no interference is advisable. When, on the other hand, the bullet as viewed
by the X-rays is seen to be in the pleural cavity, and any symptoms of its presence exist,
it may be justifiable to remove it. I saw this done in one case for the removal of a shrapnel
bullet from the lower reflexion of the pleura on account of fixed pain and tenderness complained
of by the patient. The bullet, a shrapnel, had perforated the arm, which the patient was sure
was by his side at the moment of injury, and the X-rays showed it to lie at the bottom of the
pleural cavity, where we assumed it had fallen. When, however, the bullet was removed by Mr.
Watson, he found that the fixed pain and tenderness had been the result of a fracture of a
rib from the inner side, not involving loss of continuity; hence the actual indication for
the operation had been a delusive one, since the bullet had not fallen, but expended its last
force in injuring the rib. The patient made an excellent recovery, and rejoined his regiment
at the end of six weeks. I saw several cases in which the bullet was lodged in either the lung
or bones of the spine do well with no interference. The great disadvantage of primary removal
in inducing an artificial pneumo-thorax and in laying open a hæmothorax is obvious.

In case of lodgment of the bullet in the lung, bearing in mind the infrequency of untoward
symptoms, the latter should be watched for prior to interference.

The following cases illustrate some typical instances of wound of chest accompanied by the
development of hæmothorax:--

     (154) Severe hæmothorax. Spontaneous recovery.--Wounded at
     Modder River at a distance of 30 yards. Entry, at the
     junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the
     chest-wall; exit, immediately to the left of the seventh
     dorsal spinous process. The patient arrived at the Base with
     signs of an extensive hæmothorax, accompanied by a temperature
     which reached 102° on the fourth day, and on the evening of the
     tenth 103°. The man was very ill, and an exploring needle was
     inserted, by which about an ounce of blood was evacuated. The
     signs of fluid in the left pleura were accompanied by those of
     consolidation over the lower fourth of the right lung, and the
     sputa were rusty. Evidence of perforation of the left axillary
     artery existed in feebleness of the radial pulse; and there was
     musculo-spiral paralysis.

     After the preliminary puncture, the man refused any further
     operative treatment, although a second rise of temperature
     commenced on the fifteenth day, culminating in a temperature of
     103.2° on the eighteenth. The further treatment of the patient
     consisted in the ensurance of rest and the alleviation of pain.
     A steady fall in the temperature extended over another three
     weeks, together with diminution in the signs of fluid in the
     pleura. At the end of seventy-four days the man was sent home,
     some slight dulness at the left base, and contraction of the
     chest sufficient to influence the spine in the way of lateral
     curvature, being the only remaining signs.

     (155) Severe hæmothorax. Secondary effusion. Spontaneous
     recovery.--Wounded at Koodoosberg Drift, at a distance of 200
     yards. Entry, at angle of the right scapula; exit, at the
     junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the
     chest-wall. No signs of spinal cord injury. The patient was
     brought in from the field twelve miles by an ambulance wagon on
     the second day, and in crossing the Modder River he was
     accidentally upset into the stream. For the first four days
     there was no hæmoptysis, but for the succeeding nine days small
     brightish red clots were expectorated. There was some
     tenderness over the ribs from the fifth to the ninth in the
     axillary line, and on the ninth day some gravitation ecchymosis
     appeared over the same region. Cough was an early troublesome
     symptom in this case, and when admitted to the Base hospital,
     about the seventh day, there was evidence of fluid extending
     about a third of the way up the back.

     On the tenth day after admission a pleural rub was detected at
     the upper margin of the dulness, and the latter shortly
     extended upwards over a little more than half the back.
     Meanwhile, there was no further hæmoptysis, respiration was
     fairly easy, 24 per minute, but accompanied by slight
     dilatation of the alæ nasi, and the temperature, which had been
     ranging from 99° to 100°, began to rise steadily, on the
     fifteenth day reaching 102.5°. The patient refused even an
     exploratory puncture, and was treated on the expectant plan.
     The temperature slowly subsided, with a steady improvement in
     the physical signs, and at the end of about ten weeks he left
     for home with only slight dulness and incapacity for active
     exertion remaining. (Now again on active service.)

     (156) Severe hæmothorax. Recurrent secondary effusion. Tapping
     on two occasions. Cure.--The patient was wounded at
     Paardeberg, and arrived at the Base on the eighteenth day.
     Entry, below the first rib, just external to its junction
     with the costal cartilage; exit, through the ninth rib, just
     within the posterior axillary line. The whole right side of the
     chest was dull, with signs of the presence of fluid, the heart
     being displaced to the left. There was considerable distress;
     the respirations averaged 40, the pulse 100, and the
     temperature reached 101.5° the first evening after arrival.

     On the nineteenth day the thorax was aspirated (Mr. Hanwell)
     and 50 ounces of dirty red-coloured fluid, half clot, half
     serum, were evacuated. Considerable relief was afforded; the
     respirations became slightly less frequent; the heart returned
     to a normal position, and distant tubular respiration was
     audible. The temperature dropped to normal the third day after
     evacuation of the fluid, but on the sixth day it again
     commenced to rise, and meanwhile fluid again began to collect.

     On the twenty-sixth day a second aspiration resulted in the
     evacuation of 35 ounces of bloody fluid in which flakes of
     lymph were found. Three days later the temperature became
     normal. The respirations fell to 22, and the patient made an
     uninterrupted recovery.

     (157) Moderate hæmothorax. Secondary effusion at the end of
     twenty days. Spontaneous recovery.--Wounded at Paardeberg;
     range from 700 to 1,000 yards. Entry, in the centre of the
     second right intercostal space, anteriorly; exit, at the
     level of the sixth rib posteriorly, through the scapula, close
     to its vertebral margin.

     The patient arrived at the Base on the sixth day; he said he
     expectorated some blood at the end of about ten minutes after
     being shot, and experienced a 'half-choking sensation.' A small
     quantity of phlegm and occasional clots had been expectorated
     since. He had walked about a good deal; movement occasioned
     cough, and he became 'blown' very rapidly.

     On admission there were signs of fluid in the lower third of
     the pleural cavity, but no general symptoms beyond an evening
     rise of temperature to an average of 99°. About the twentieth
     day the temperature commenced to rise, and on the twenty-third
     and four following evenings reached 102°. The fever was
     accompanied by some distress, and a well-marked increase in the
     physical signs of the presence of fluid in the chest. The pulse
     rose to 96, and the respirations considerably above the average
     of 24, which was at first noted. A strictly expectant attitude
     was maintained, and the temperature steadily fell in a curve
     corresponding to the rise, gradually reaching the normal at the
     end of a week. The physical signs at the base steadily cleared
     up, and at the end of six weeks the patient returned to England
     convalescent.

CHAPTER XI

INJURIES TO THE ABDOMEN

Perhaps no chapter of military surgery was looked forward to with more eager interest than
that dealing with wounds of the abdomen. In none was greater expectation indulged in with regard
to probable advance in active surgical treatment, and in none did greater disappointment lie
in store for us.

Wounds of the solid viscera, it is true, proved to be of minor importance when produced by
bullets of small calibre; but wounds of the intestinal tract, although they showed themselves
capable of spontaneous recovery in a certain proportion of the cases observed, afforded but
slight opportunity for surgical skill, and results generally deviated but slightly from those
of past experience. Such success as was met with depended rather on the mechanical genesis
and nature of the wounds than upon the efforts of the surgeon, and operative surgery scored
but few successes.

It is true that to the Civil Surgeon accustomed to surroundings replete with every modern appliance
and convenience, and the possibility of exercising the most stringent precautions against the
introduction of sepsis from without, abdominal operations presented difficulties only faintly
appreciated in advance; but this alone scarcely accounted for the want of success attending
the active treatment of wounds of the intestine when occasion demanded. Failure was rather
to be referred to the severity of the local injury to be dealt with, or to the operations being
necessarily undertaken at too late a date. Many fatalities, again, were due to the association
of other injuries, a large proportion of the wound tracks involving other organs or parts beyond
the boundaries of the abdominal cavity.

The frequent association of wounds of the thoracic cavity with those of the abdomen afforded
many of the most striking examples of immunity from serious consequences as a result of wound
of the pleura. It must be conceded that in a large number of such injuries only the extreme
limits of the pleural sac were encroached upon, yet in some the tracks passed through the lungs,
although without serious consequences. Under the heading of injury to the large intestine a
somewhat special form of pleural septicæmia will be referred to.

It may at once be stated that such favourable results as occurred in abdominal injuries were
practically limited to wounds caused by bullets of small calibre, and that, although in the
short chapter dealing with shell injuries a few recoveries from visceral wounds will be mentioned,
I never met with a penetrating visceral injury from a Martini-Henry or large sporting bullet
which did not prove fatal.

Wounds of the abdominal wall.--It is somewhat paradoxical to say that these injuries possessed
special interest from their comparative rarity of occurrence, since they were not of intrinsic
importance. Their infrequency depended on the difficulty of striking the body in such a plane
as to implicate the belly wall alone, and their interest in the diagnostic difficulty which
they gave rise to.

In many cases the position of the openings and the strongly oval or gutter character possessed
by them were sufficient proof of the superficial passage of the bullet; in others we had to
bear in mind that the position of the patient when struck was rarely that of rest in the supine
position, in which the surgical examination was made, and considerable difficulty arose. Some
superficial tracks crossing the belly wall have already been referred to in the chapter on
wounds in general and in that dealing with injuries to the chest, in which the above characters
sufficed to indicate that penetration of the abdominal cavity had not occurred. In other instances
a definite subcutaneous gutter could be traced, and often in these a well-marked cord in the
abdominal wall corresponding to the track could be felt at a later date. Again, limitation
to the abdominal wall was sometimes proved by the position of the retained bullet, or sometimes
by the presence in the track of foreign bodies carried in with the projectile. See case 160.

Fig. 84 illustrates an example where the limitation to the abdominal wall was evident on inspection.
Here the division of the thick muscles of the abdominal wall had led to the formation of a
swelling exactly similar to that seen after the subcutaneous rupture of a muscle, and two soft
fluctuating tumours bounded by contracted muscle existed in the substance of the oblique and
rectus muscles.

The cases which presented the most serious diagnostic difficulty in this relation were those
in which the wound was situated in the thicker muscular portions of the lower part of the abdominal
and pelvic walls. Such a case is illustrated in the chapter on fractures (see fig. 55, p. 191).
I saw one or two such instances, in which only the exploration necessary for treatment of the
fracture decided the point. In many of the wounds affecting the lateral portion of the abdominal
wall the question of penetration could never be definitely cleared up, as wounds of the colon
sometimes gave rise to absolutely no symptoms.

In a certain proportion of the injuries the peritoneal cavity was no doubt perforated without
the infliction of any further visceral injury, and in these also the doubt as to the occurrence
of penetration was never solved.

     (158) Wound of belly wall.--Wounded at Modder River. Entry
     (Mauser), 2 inches below the centre of the left iliac crest;
     exit, 1-1/2 inch above and internal to the left anterior
     superior iliac spine. The patient was on horseback at the time
     of the injury and did not fall; he got down, however, and lay
     on the field an hour, whence he was removed to hospital.
     Probably the track pierced the ilium, and remained confined to
     the abdominal wall. There were no signs of visceral injury.

     (159) Cape Boy. Wounded at Modder River. Entry (Lee-Metford),
     immediately above and outside right anterior superior spine;
     exit, 1-1/2 inch below and to right of umbilicus. A
     well-marked swelling corresponded with division of the fibres
     of the oblique muscles and of the rectus, and on palpation a
     hollow corresponding with the track was felt. The abdominal
     muscles were exceptionally well developed (fig. 84).

     (160) Wounded at Magersfontein while lying prone. Entry,
     irregular, oblique, and somewhat contused, over the eighth left
     rib, in the anterior axillary line; exit, a slit wound
     immediately above and to the left of the umbilicus. The bullet
     struck a small circular metal looking-glass before entering,
     hence the irregularity of the wound. The patient developed a
     hæmothorax, but no abdominal signs; the former was probably
     parietal in origin, secondary to the fractured rib, and the
     whole wound non-penetrating as far as the abdominal cavity was
     concerned.

     (161) Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), 1-1/2 inch
     external to and 1/2 inch below the left posterior superior
     iliac spine; exit, 1 inch internal horizontally to the left
     anterior superior spine.

     No signs of intra-peritoneal injury were noted, but free
     suppuration occurred in left loin; the ilium was tunnelled.

     The same patient was wounded by a Jeffrey bullet in the hand;
     the third metacarpal was pulverised, although the bullet, which
     was longitudinally flanged, was retained.

     (162) Wounded outside Heilbron. Entry, below the eighth right
     costal cartilage; exit, below the eighth cartilage of the
     left side. The wound of entry was slightly oval; that of exit
     continued out as a 'flame'-like groove for 2 inches. A week
     later the wound track could be palpated as an evident hard
     continuous cord.

Penetration of the intestinal area without definite evidence of visceral injury.--This accident
occurred with a sufficient degree of frequency to obtain the greatest importance, both from
the point of view of diagnosis and prognosis, and as affecting the question of operative interference.
Amongst the cases reported below a number occurred in which it was impossible to settle the
question whether injury to the bowel had occurred or not, and I will here shortly give what
explanation I can for the apparent escape of the intestine from serious injury.

We may first recall the general question of the escape of structures lying to one or other
side of the track of the bullet. I believe that there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of
the remarks already made as to the escape of such structures as the nerves by means of displacement,
and that the occurrence of such escapes is manifestly dependent on the degree of fixity of
the nerve or the special segment of it implicated. The general tendency of the tissues around
the tracks to escape extensive destruction from actual contusion has also been referred to,
and is, I think, indisputable.

If these observations be accepted, I think there can be no difficulty in allowing that the
small intestine is exceptionally well arranged to escape injury. First of all, it is very moveable;
secondly, it is so arranged that in certain directions a bullet may pass almost parallel to
the long axis of the coils; thirdly, it is elastic, capable of compression, and light, and
hence offers but a small degree of resistance to the passage of the bullet across the abdominal
cavity.

Certain evidence both clinical and pathological supports the contention that the small intestine
may escape injury from the passing bullet.

First of all, the fact may be broadly stated that injuries to the small intestine were fatal
in the great majority of certainly diagnosed cases, while, on the other hand, many tracks crossed
the area occupied by the small intestine without serious symptoms of any kind resulting. Secondly,
experience showed that when the bullet crossed the line of the fixed portions of the large
intestine the gut rarely escaped, and that, although a considerable proportion of these cases
recovered spontaneously, in a large number of them immediate symptoms, or secondary complications,
clearly substantiated the nature of the original injury. As far as my experience went, however,
I never saw any instance in which an undoubted injury of the small intestine was followed by
the development of a local peritoneal suppuration and recovery, a sequence by no means uncommon
in the case of wounds of the large intestine. Although, therefore, I am not prepared to deny
the possibility of spontaneous recovery from an injury to the small intestine, under certain
conditions which will be stated later, I believe that in the immense majority of cases in which
a bullet crossed the small intestine area without the supervention of serious symptoms, the
small intestine escaped perforating injury.

Beyond the clinical evidence offered above, certain pathological observations support the view
that the intestine escapes perforation by displacement. Most of my knowledge on this subject
was derived from the limited number of abdominal sections I performed on cases of injury to
the small intestine, and may be summed up as follows.

The small intestine may present evidence of lateral contusion in the shape of elongated ecchymoses,
either parallel, oblique, or transverse to its long axis. These ecchymoses resemble in extent
and outline those which ordinarily surround a wound of the intestinal wall produced by a bullet
(see fig. 87, p. 418).

The wall of the small intestine may be wounded to an extent short of perforation, either the
peritoneal coat alone being split, or the wound implicating the muscular coat and producing
an appearance similar to that seen when the intestine is dragged upon during an operation,
but without so much gaping of the edges (see fig. 85, p. 416).

I met with these conditions in association with co-existing complete perforations of the small
intestine, and in one case of intra-peritoneal hæmorrhage in which no complete perforation
was discoverable (No. 169, p. 432).

The implication and perforation of the small intestine are to some extent influenced by the
direction of the wound. A striking case is included below, No. 201, in which a bullet passed
from the loin to the iliac fossa on each side of the body, approximately parallel to the course
of the inner margin of the colon, and I also saw some other wounds in this direction in which
no evidence of injury to the small intestine was detected, and which got well. Again wounds
from flank to flank were, as a rule, very fatal; but I saw more than one instance where these
wounds were situated immediately below the crest of the ilium, in which the intestine escaped
injury (see case 171). A very striking observation was made by Mr. Cheatle in such a wound.
The patient died as a result of a double perforation of both cæcum and sigmoid flexure; none
the less the bullet had crossed the small intestine area without inflicting any injury.

The sum of my experience, in fact, was to encourage the belief that, unless the intestine was
struck in such a direction as to render lateral displacement an impossibility, the gut often
escaped perforation.

As a rule, the wounds of the abdomen which from their position proved the most dangerous to
the intestine were--

1. Wounds passing from one flank to the other were very dangerous, as crossing complicated
coils of the small intestine, and two fixed portions of the colon. This danger was most marked
when the wounds were situated between the eighth rib in the mid axillary line and the crest
of the ilium; above this level the liver, or possibly liver and stomach, were sometimes alone
implicated, and the cases did well. Again, when the wounds crossed the false pelvis the patients
sometimes escaped all injury to viscera.

2. Antero-posterior wounds in the small intestine area were very fatal if the course was direct;
in such the small intestine seldom escaped injury.

3. Wounds with a certain degree of obliquity from anterior wall to flank, or from flank to
loin, were on the other hand comparatively favourable, as the small intestine often escaped,
and if any gut was wounded, it was often the colon.

4. Vertical wounds implicating the chest and abdomen, or the abdomen and pelvis, were on the
whole not very unfavourable. For instance, when the bullet entered by the buttock and emerged
below the umbilicus, a number of patients escaped fatal injury; this depended on the comparatively
good prognosis in wounds of the rectum and bladder. A good many patients in whom the bullet
entered by the upper part of the loin, and escaped 1-1/2 inch within the anterior superior
spine of the ilium, also did well. The same holds good when the wounds either entered or emerged
under the anterior costal margin of the thorax, either prior to or after traversing the thorax.

Wounds passing directly backward from the iliac regions were in my experience very unfavourable;
but I believe mainly as a result of hæmorrhage from the iliac arteries.

The occurrence of wounds of the abdomen of an 'explosive' character.--The vast majority of
the abdominal wounds observed in the Stationary or Base hospitals were of the type dimensions.
A certain number of the abdominal injuries which proved fatal on the field or shortly afterwards
were described as explosive in character, and were referred by the observers to the employment
of expanding bullets.

A few words on this subject seem necessary, because it seems doubtful whether such injuries
could be produced by any of the forms of expanding bullet of small calibre in use, unless the
track crossed one of the bones in the abdominal or pelvic wall. That this was sometimes the
case there is no doubt: thus I saw two cases in which the splenic flexure of the colon was
wounded, in which the external opening was large, and a comminuted fracture of the ribs of
the left side existed. One can well believe that bullets passing through the pelvic bones might
'set up' to a considerable extent, and although I never happened to see such a case, an explanation
of some of the wounds described by others might be found in this occurrence.

In instances in which the soft parts alone were perforated, I am disinclined to believe that
bullets of small calibre, either regulation or soft-nosed, were responsible for the injuries.
I had the opportunity of examining two Mauser bullets of the Jeffreys variety which crossed
the abdomen and caused death. In the first (figured on page 94, fig. 40) very little alteration
beyond slight shortening had occurred. In the second the deformity was almost the same, except
that the side of the bullet was indented, probably from impact with some object prior to its
entry into the body. In each case the bullet was of course travelling at a low rate of velocity;
hence no very strong inference can be drawn from either. In the case of the second specimen,
which was removed by Mr. Cheatle, a remarkable observation was made, which tends to throw some
light on one possible mode of production of large exit apertures. This bullet crossed the cæcum,
making two small type openings; but later, when it crossed the sigmoid flexure, it tore two
large irregular openings in the gut. This might be explained on the ground that the velocity
was so small as only just to allow of perforation, which therefore took the nature of a tear.
I am inclined to suggest, as a more likely explanation, that the spent bullet turned head over
heels in its course across the abdomen, and made lateral or irregular impact with the last
piece of bowel it touched. A slightly greater degree of force would have allowed a similar
large and irregular opening to be made in the abdominal wall also.

In this relation the question will naturally be raised as to how far the explosive appearances
may have been due to high velocity alone on the part of the bullet. I am disinclined from my
general experience to believe that explosive injuries of the soft parts were to be thus explained.
On the other hand, I believe that the possession of a low degree of velocity very greatly increased
the danger in abdominal wounds. I believe that the bowel was, under these circumstances, less
likely to escape by displacement, and was more widely torn when wounded; again, that inexact
impact led to increase of size in the external apertures, and the bullet was of course more
often retained.

Mr. Watson Cheyne[19] published a very remarkable instance of one of the dangers of an injury
from a spent bullet, in which, in spite of non-penetration of the abdominal cavity, the small
intestine was ruptured in two places.

I believe the majority of the wounds designated as explosive were the result of the passage
of large leaden bullets, either of the Martini-Henry or Express type. The small opportunity
of observing such injuries in the hospitals of course depended on the fact that the majority
were rapidly fatal.

Nature of the anatomical lesion in wounds of the intestine.--The openings in the parietal peritoneum
tended to assume the slit or star forms, probably on account of the elasticity of the membrane.
A diagram of one of these forms is appended to fig. 89. In this instance the opening in the
peritoneum was made from the abdominal aspect, prior to the escape of the bullet from the cavity,
and on the impact of the tip, the long axis of the bullet was oblique to the surface of the
abdominal wall.

In the intestinal wall the openings varied in character according to the mode of impact.

In some cases the gut was merely contused by lateral contact of the passing bullet. The result
of this was evidenced later by the presence of localised oval patches of ecchymosis. These
were identical in appearance with the patches shown surrounding the wounds in fig. 87.

More forcible lateral impact produced a split of the peritoneum, or of this together with the
muscular coat. Such a lateral slit is shown in fig. 85, although the clearness of outline is
somewhat impaired by the presence of a considerable amount of inflammatory lymph.

Fig. 86 exhibits a lateral injury of a more pronounced form. The bullet here struck the most
prominent portion of the under surface of the bowel, and produced a circular perforation not
very unlike one produced by rectangular impact, except in the lesser degree of eversion of
the mucous membrane. Here again the appearance is somewhat altered by the presence of a considerable
amount of lymph, but this is of less importance in this figure because the lymph is localised
to the portion of the bowel in the immediate neighbourhood of the opening which had suffered
contusion and erasion.

Fig. 87, A B, illustrates a symmetrical perforation of the small intestine; the aperture of
entry (A) is roughly circular, and a ring of mucous membrane protrudes and partially closes
the opening. The aperture of exit is a curved slit, again partially occluded by the mucous
membrane. The same amount of difference between the two apertures did not always exist; in
many cases both were circular, and apparently symmetrical. Beyond this I have seen three apertures
in close proximity, two lying on the same aspect of the bowel, and the first of these was no
doubt an opening due to lateral impact similar to that seen in fig. 86. In the recent condition
little difference existed between the three apertures.

The localised ecchymosis surrounding the apertures is quite characteristic of this form of
injury, and is a valuable aid to finding the openings during an operation.

Fig. 88 shows the interior of the same segment of bowel, as fig. 87. It shows the localised
ecchymosis as seen from the inner surface, here rather more extensive from the fact that the
blood spreads more readily in the submucous tissue.

It will be noted that the main feature of the form of injury is the regular outline and the
small size of the wounds. Another feature not illustrated by the figures should also be mentioned.
In the ruptures of intestine with which we are acquainted in civil practice the wound in the
gut is almost without exception situated at the free border of the bowel, but in these injuries
it was just as frequently at the mesenteric margin. The importance of this factor is considerable,
since wounds near the mesenteric edge are much more likely to be accompanied by hæmorrhage,
and thus the opportunity for diffusion of infection is considerably multiplied, to say nothing
of the danger from loss of blood.

Beyond these more or less pure perforations, long slits or gutters were occasionally cut. I
saw instances of these in the case of the ascending colon, and in the small curvature of the
stomach. The comparative fixity of the portion of bowel struck is a matter of great importance
in the production of this form of injury.

It may be well to add that, although the figures inserted are all taken from small-intestine
wounds, the nature of the wounds of the peritoneum-clad part of the large intestine in no way
differed from them, except in so far as fixity of the bowel exposed it to a more extensive
wound when the bullet took a parallel course to its long axis.

A more important point in the injuries to the large intestine was the possibility of an extra-peritoneal
wound. I saw several such lesions of the colon, every one of which ended fatally. I became
still more fully convinced of the greater seriousness of extra- to intra-peritoneal rupture
of this portion of the gut than I was when I expressed a similar opinion in a former paper.[20]
It will be seen later that the results of intra- and extra-peritoneal wounds of the bladder
fully confirm this view, as all extra-peritoneal injuries died, while many intra-peritoneal
perforations recovered spontaneously.

Wounds of the mesentery.--I had little experience of this injury; in fact, case 169, on which
I operated, was my sole observation. It stands to reason, however, that injuries to the mesentery
would be much more frequent proportionately to wounds of the gut than is the case in the ruptures
seen in civil practice, since the whole area of the mesentery is equally open to injury. Viewing
the extreme danger of hæmorrhage into the peritoneal cavity in these injuries, I should be
inclined to expect that a considerable proportion of those deaths from abdominal wounds which
took place on the field of battle were due to this source.

Wounds of the omentum.--Here, again, I am unable to express any opinion, although the supposition
that hæmorrhage from this source took place is natural.

Prolapse of omentum was comparatively rare, except in cases with large wounds; it was apparently
seen with some frequency among patients who died rapidly on the field of battle. I only saw
it twice, and on each occasion in shell wounds. The wounds from small-calibre bullets were
as a rule too small to allow of external prolapse.

Fig. 89, however, illustrates a very interesting observation. A patient in the German Ambulance
in Heilbron, under Dr. Flockemann, died as a result of suppuration and hæmorrhage secondary
to an injury to the colon. At the autopsy a portion of the omentum was found adherent in the
wound of exit, but it had not reached the external surface. The chief interest of the observation
lies in the light it throws on the mechanism of these injuries. It is impossible to conceive
that a small-calibre bullet coming into direct contact with the omentum could do anything but
perforate it. It, therefore, appears clear that in a displacement like that figured, only lateral
impact occurred with the omentum, which was carried along by the spin and rush of the bullet
into the canal of exit, where it lodged.

Results of injury to the intestine. 1. Escape of contents and infection of the peritoneal cavity.--I
think there is little special to be said on this subject. The escape of contents into the peritoneal
cavity was by no means free, unless the injury was multiple. Thus in one case of injury to
the small intestine, No. 166, on which I operated, there was absolutely no gross escape until
the bowel was removed from the abdominal cavity, when the contents spurted out freely. In one
case of very oblique injury to the colon there was a considerable quantity of fæcal matter
in a localised space, but as a rule the ordinary condition best described as 'peritoneal infection'
from the wound was found. The bad effect of anything like free escape was well shown in multiple
perforations; in these suppurative peritonitis rapidly developed and the patients died at the
end of thirty-six hours or less. A typical case is quoted in No. 168.

2. Peritoneal infection, and general septicæmia.--As is evident from the results quoted among
the cases, the degree which this reached varied greatly. It may of course be assumed that in
some measure it occurred in every case in which the bowel was perforated, but it was sometimes
so slight as to be scarcely noticeable. This may be said to have been most common in injuries
to the large intestine. Wounds of the cæcum, ascending and descending colon, the sigmoid flexure,
or the rectum, were sometimes followed by no serious symptoms, either local or general. Again
in these portions of the bowel the development of local signs, and the later formation of an
abscess, were by no means uncommon.

In the case of the small intestine I never observed this sequence, and the same may be said
of the transverse colon, which in its anatomical arrangement and position so nearly approximates
to the small bowel. In suspected wounds of these portions of the bowel either the symptoms
were so slight as to render it doubtful whether a perforation had occurred, or marked signs
of general peritoneal septicæmia developed, and death resulted.

The condition of the peritoneum in fatal cases varied much. In some a dry peritonitis, or one
in which a considerable quantity of slightly turbid fluid was effused, was found. In others
a rapid suppurative process, accompanied by the effusion of large quantities of plastic lymph,
was met with. My experience suggested that the latter condition was the result of free infection
from multiple wounds of the gut, the former the accompaniment of single wounds. Hence I should
ascribe the difference mainly to the extent of the primary infection.

This is perhaps a suitable place to further discuss the explanation of the escape of a considerable
number of the patients who received wounds of the abdomen, possibly implicating the bowel.
Although this was not, I think, so common an occurrence as has been sometimes assumed, yet
many examples were met with. Several reasons have been advanced.

(1) Great importance has been given to the fact that many of the men were wounded while in
a state of hunger, no food having been taken for twelve or more hours before the reception
of the injury. In view of the well-proved fact in these, as in other intestinal injuries, that
free intestinal escape does not occur, and that it is usually a mere question of infection,
this explanation, in my opinion, is of small importance. It might with far more justice be
pointed out that many of these wounded men were for them in the happy position of not having
friends freely dosing them with brandy and water after the reception of the injury, and this
was possibly an element of some importance.

Some of the men did, however, drink freely, and in one case which terminated fatally a comrade
gave a man wounded through the belly an immediate dose of Beecham's pills.

(2) Mr. Treves has suggested that the effect of the severe trauma on the muscular coat of the
bowel is to cause a cessation of peristaltic movement. This, as in the case of 'local shock'
elsewhere, may no doubt be of importance, and to it should be added the simultaneous cessation
of abdominal respiratory movements in the segment of the belly wall covering the injured part.
The occurrence of general cessation of peristaltic movement is, however, to some extent opposed
by the fact that in a certain number of the cases early passage of motions was seen just as
happens in the intestinal ruptures seen in civil practice.

I should be inclined to ascribe the escape from serious infection in these injuries to the
same cause which accounts for their comparative insignificance in other regions--namely, the
small calibre of the bullet and consequent small size of the lesion: in point of fact to the
minimal nature of the primary infection. I very much doubt if any patient who had more than
one complete perforation of the small intestine got well during the whole campaign. This opinion
is, moreover, supported by the fact that the prognosis was so far better in cases of injury
to the large than to the small intestine, in which former segment of the bowel we have the
advantages of a position beyond the region in which intestinal movement is most free, the unlikelihood
of multiple injury, and a drier and more solid type of fæcal contents.

In the instances in which recovery followed perforating injuries without any bad signs we can
only assume a minimal infection, and sufficient irritation and reaction on the part of the
bowel to produce rapid adhesion between contiguous coils, and thus provisional closure.

The other mode of spontaneous recovery which I saw several times take place in the injuries
to the large bowel consisted in the limitation of the spread of infection by early adhesions
and the development of a local abscess. The non-observance of this process in any case of injury
to the small intestine raises very great doubts in my mind as to the frequent recovery of patients
in whom the small intestine was perforated.

INJURIES TO THE INTESTINAL TRACT

1. Wounds of the stomach.--A considerable number of wounds in such a situation as to have possibly
implicated the stomach were observed, and of these a certain number recovered spontaneously.
The only two instances that came under my own observation are recorded below. It will be noted
that in each the special symptoms were the classic ones of vomiting and hæmatemesis. In the
first case blood was also passed per anum, and in the second the diagnosis was reinforced by
the escape of stomach contents from the external wound.

The second case was a surgical disappointment. No doubt the fatal issue was mainly dependent
on the fact that the external wound had to be kept open to allow of the escape of the abundant
discharge from the wounded liver. In the absence of the hepatic wound, however, I believe it
would have been possible for this patient to have got well spontaneously, in view of the firm
adhesions which had formed around the opening in the stomach, and the consequent localisation
which had been effected. Another unfortunate element in this case was the comminuted fracture
of the seventh costal cartilage, which maintained the patency of the aperture of exit. The
latter point, however, was of doubtful importance from this aspect, as the vent provided for
the gastric and biliary secretions may have been the safety-valve that had allowed localisation
to develop.

I believe that the secondary hæmorrhage was the main element in robbing us of a success in
this case, and that this depended on the digestion of the wound by the gastric secretion. The
early troubles which arose in the treatment of this patient well illustrate the difficulties
by which the military surgeon is at times met; but the patient was admirably attended to and
nursed by my friend Mr. Pershouse, and an orderly who was specially put on duty for the purpose.

     (163) Wounded at Rensburg. Entry (Mauser), in ninth left
     intercostal space in posterior axillary line; exit, a
     transverse slit 1/2 an inch in length to left of xiphoid
     appendage. Patient was retiring when struck; he did not fall,
     but ran for about 1,000 yards, whence he was conveyed to
     hospital. He vomited half an hour after the injury (last meal
     bread and 'bully beef,' taken two hours previously), and during
     the evening three times again, the vomit consisting mainly 'of
     dark thick blood.' He was put on milk diet, and not completely
     starved; on the third day a large quantity of dark clotted
     blood was passed per rectum with the stool, and this continued
     for two days.

     Ten days after the injury the temperature was still rising to
     100°, and did not become normal till the fourteenth day. The
     pulse averaged 80. The abdomen, meanwhile, moved fairly well,
     respirations 18 to 20. Some tenderness was present in the
     epigastrium and towards the spleen. Resonance throughout.
     Ordinary diet was now resumed, and beyond slight epigastric
     pain on deep inspiration, no further symptoms were observed,
     and the patient left for England at the end of the month. The
     spleen may have been traversed in this patient, as well as the
     lower margin of the right lung.

     (164*) Wounded at Enslin. Entry (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch from
     the spine, opposite the eighth intercostal space; exit,
     through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch from the
     median line. The patient was lying in the prone position when
     shot: he vomited blood freely, and the bowels acted three times
     before he was seen forty hours after the accident, each motion
     containing dark blood.

     On the commencement of the third day the patient's expression
     was extremely anxious, and he was suffering great pain. Pulse
     96, temperature 100°. Tongue moist, occasional vomiting, bowels
     open yesterday. Has taken fluid nourishment since injury. The
     abdomen moved with respiration, but was moderately distended,
     especially in the line of the transverse colon; it was
     tympanitic on percussion, there was no dulness in the flanks,
     and only moderate rigidity of the wall on palpation. Frothy
     fluid stained with bile and fæcal in odour was escaping from
     the wound of exit, and the everted margins of the latter were
     bile-stained.

     A vertical incision was carried downwards from the wound for 4
     inches. A rugged furrow was found on the under surface of the
     left lobe of the liver; the stomach was contracted and firmly
     adherent by recent lymph to the under surface of the liver and
     the diaphragm. The transverse colon was much distended. On
     separating the stomach a slit wound was found at the lesser
     curvature, immediately to the right of the oesophagus. This
     wound was closed with some difficulty with two tiers of
     sutures; the cavity was mopped out, and then irrigated with
     boiled water; a plug was introduced along the line of the
     furrow in the liver, and the lower part of the abdominal
     incision closed.

     The patient stood the operation well, and was removed to his
     tent; during the day, however, two thunder showers occurred
     during each of which water, several inches if not a foot deep,
     rushed through the camp. After the second flood he was removed
     to the operating room, the only house we had, and slept there.
     The pulse rose to 120, and respiration to 26, and there was
     pain, which was subdued by 1/3 grain of morphia, administered
     subcutaneously. A fair amount of urine was passed, and the
     bowels acted once, the motion containing blood.

     On the second day after operation there was some improvement;
     the pulse still numbered 116, and the temperature was raised to
     100°, but the belly moved fairly, and pain was moderate.
     Abundant foul-smelling, bile-stained discharge came from the
     wound when the plug was removed. Rectal feeding was
     supplemented by small quantities of milk and soda by the mouth.

     The condition did not materially change, but on the fourth day
     it was evident that the suturing of the stomach wound had given
     way, and liquid food escaped readily when taken. The discharge
     remained bile-stained and very foul. No extension of
     inflammation to the general peritoneal cavity occurred, but it
     was evident that the patient was suffering from constitutional
     infection from the foul wound, the lower part of which opened
     up somewhat after the removal of the stitches on the seventh
     day. The wound was irrigated three times daily with 1-300
     creolin lotion, but remained very foul. The man slowly lost
     strength, although escape from the stomach considerably
     decreased. On the tenth day a sudden severe hæmorrhage
     occurred, presumably from a large branch of the coeliac axis.
     The bleeding was readily controlled by a plug, and did not
     recur; but the patient rapidly sank, and died on the twelfth
     day after the operation, and fourteen days after reception of
     the injury. No post-mortem examination was made.

2. Wounds of the small intestine.--These were comparatively common, but offered little that
was special either in their symptoms or the results attending them. Wounds were met with in
every part of the small gut; but I saw no case in which an injury to the duodenum could be
specially diagnosed.

As to the symptoms which attended these injuries, it is somewhat difficult to speak with precision,
and it must be left to my readers to form an opinion as to how many of the cases recounted
below were really instances of perforating wounds. My own view is that in the majority of the
cases that got well spontaneously, the injury was not of a perforating nature, and that for
reasons which have been already set forth. It will, however, be at once noted that in all the
five cases in which the injury was certainly diagnosed in hospital death occurred.

The cases of injury to the small intestine are perhaps best arranged in three classes.

1. Those who died upon the field, or shortly after removal from it. In these the external wounds
were often large, the omentum was not rarely prolapsed, and escape of fæces sometimes occurred
early. Shock from the severity of the lesion, and hæmorrhage, were no doubt important factors
in the early lethal issue in this class. Many of the injuries were no doubt produced by bullets
striking irregularly, by ricochets, by bullets of the expanding forms, or by bullets of large
calibre. As being beyond the bounds of surgical aid, this class possessed the least interest.

2. Cases brought into the Field, or even the Stationary hospitals, with symptoms of moderate
severity, or even of an insignificant character, in which evidence of septic peritonitis suddenly
developed and death ensued.

3. Cases in which the position of the wounds raised the possibility of injury to the intestine,
but in which the symptoms were slight or of moderate severity, and which recovered spontaneously.

The whole crux in diagnosis lay in the attempt to separate the two latter classes, and, personally,
I must own to having been no nearer a position of being able to form an opinion on this point,
in the late than in the early stage of my stay in South Africa. The advent of peritoneal septicæmia
was in many instances the only determining moment. On this matter I can only add that, in civil
practice, an exploratory abdominal section is often the only means of determination of a rupture
of the bowel wall.

With regard to the cases of suspected injury to the bowel which recovered spontaneously, the
symptoms were somewhat special in their comparative slightness, and in the limited nature of
the local signs. Thus the pulse seldom rose to as much as 100 in rate, 80 was a common average.
Respiration was never greatly quickened, 24 was a common rate. The temperature rarely exceeded
100°. Vomiting was occasionally severe, but usually not persistent, ceasing on the second day.
A good quantity of urine was passed. As to the local signs, these again were of a limited nature;
distension did not occur, or was slight; movement of the abdominal wall was only restricted
in the neighbourhood of the wound, the affected area amounted to a quarter, or at most half,
the abdominal wall, and rigidity was localised to a similar segment. Local tenderness usually
existed; but, as a rule, there was little or no dulness to point to the occurrence either of
fluid effusion or a considerable deposition of lymph.

Again many of the patients suffered with very slight symptoms of constitutional shock, although
there was considerable variation in this particular.

     (165*) Wounded at Graspan, sustaining a compound fracture of
     the fibula. While being carried off the field, a second bullet
     (Lee-Metford) entered immediately outside the left posterior
     superior iliac spine, perforated the pelvis, and emerged 1-1/2
     inch within the left anterior superior spine. The patient was
     then put down and left on the field ten hours; later he was
     carried to shelter for the night, and arrived at Orange River
     on the second day. He suffered with some pain in the abdomen,
     especially during the journey in the train, but was not sick;
     the bowels were confined.

     When seen on the third day at 6 P.M., some pain was complained
     of in the abdomen, which moved freely in the upper part, but
     was motionless below the umbilicus. No distension. Tenderness
     around wound of exit and some rigidity. The bowels had acted
     four times during the day; motions loose, dark brown, and
     containing no blood. Face not anxious, eyes bright, temperature
     102°. Pulse 96, regular, and of good strength. Tongue moist and
     little furred.

     The abdomen was opened at 5 A.M. on the fourth day, as the
     local signs had become more pronounced, and the patient had
     passed a restless night in great abdominal pain. A local
     incision was chosen, as the wound was presumably in the sigmoid
     flexure. The sigmoid flexure was adherent to the abdominal wall
     opposite the wound of exit, and a dark ecchymosed patch was
     found, but no perforation could be detected. Foul pus and gas
     escaped freely from the pelvis, but no wound of the large bowel
     could be discovered here. On enlarging the incision upwards
     three openings were found in a coil of jejunum, probably that
     about five feet from the duodenal junction usually provided
     with the longest mesentery. No fourth opening could be found.
     The openings were circular, about 1/3 inch in diameter, clean
     cut, with a ring of everted mucous membrane, and the wall of
     the bowel in the neighbourhood was thickened. All three
     openings were included within a length of 2-1/2 inches. There
     was no surrounding ecchymosis of the bowel wall. Very little
     escaped intestinal contents were found in the situation of the
     bowel. The latter had apparently been retracted upwards, and
     lay to the left of the lumbar spine. The wounds were readily
     closed by five Lembert's sutures, three crossing the openings,
     and one at each end. The belly was then washed out with boiled
     water and closed. The delay in finding the wounds due to the
     mistaken impression that they would be found in the pelvis
     materially prolonged the operation, which lasted an hour and a
     half. The patient never rallied, and died seventeen hours
     later. It is possible that a wound in the sigmoid flexure was
     present which had already closed at the time of operation.

     (166*) Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), opposite
     central point of left ilium; exit, 1-1/2 inch above the
     centre of the right Poupart's ligament. Vomiting commenced soon
     after the injury, and this was continuous until the patient's
     arrival in the Stationary hospital on the fourth day, when the
     condition was as follows:--

     Face extremely anxious in expression. Temperature 101°,
     sweating freely. Pulse 110, fair strength. Tongue moist.
     Abdomen much distended, rigid, motionless, tympanitic
     throughout. Bowels confined. No urine had been passed for
     twenty-four hours, [Symbol: ounce]ij in bladder on
     catheterisation, clear, and containing no blood.

     Abdominal section. Median incision. A considerable quantity of
     bloody effusion was evacuated. Intestine generally congested
     and distended. No lymph. Two wounds were found in the ileum on
     the opposite sides of one coil; the openings were circular,
     with the mucous membrane everted. No escape of fæcal matter was
     visible until the intestine was delivered, when intestinal
     contents spurted freely across the room. The openings were
     sutured with five Lembert's stitches. The bowel was punctured
     in two places to relieve distension, and then returned into the
     belly, after washing with boiled water.

     Four pints of saline solution were infused into the median
     basilic vein, and 1/30 grain strychnine sulph. was injected
     hypodermically.

     The patient did not rally, and died twelve hours after the
     operation.

     (167*) Wounded at Graspan. Entry (Lee-Metford), midway
     between the umbilicus and pubes; exit, 1 inch to the left of
     the fifth lumbar spine. The patient was seen on the third day
     in the following condition: in great pain, expression extremely
     anxious, vomiting constantly. Pulse 150 running, respirations
     48. Temperature 100°, sweating freely. Great distension,
     rigidity, and general tenderness of immobile abdomen. No
     improvement followed the administration of brandy and
     hypodermic injection of strychnine 1/30 grain, and operation
     was deemed hopeless.

     In the evening the patient was apparently dying. Face blue and
     sunken and covered with sweat, eyes dull, speechless, pulse
     imperceptible, restlessness extreme, bowels acting
     involuntarily, no urine in bladder.

     The man was placed in a tent by himself, and to my surprise was
     alive and better the next morning; the expression was still
     anxious, but the face brighter and not sweating; the pulse
     only numbered 100, but was very weak, and the hands and feet
     were cold. The condition of the abdomen was unaltered, but the
     thoracic respiration had decreased in rapidity from 48 to 28.

     His condition still seemed to preclude any chance of successful
     intervention, but none the less life was retained until the
     morning of the seventh day, the state alternating between a
     moribund one and one of slight improvement. He was lucid at
     times, although for the most part wandering, and was so
     restless that no covering could be kept upon him. Vomiting was
     continuous, so that no nourishment could be retained; the
     bowels acted frequently involuntarily, and little or no urine
     was passed. Meanwhile, the abdomen became flat, then sunken, an
     area of induration and tenderness about 6 inches in diameter
     developing around the wound of entry. Slight variations in the
     pulse, and from normal to subnormal in the temperature, were
     noted, and death eventually occurred from septicæmia and
     inanition.

     (168*) Wounded at Driefontein. Entry (Mauser), above the
     posterior third of the left iliac crest, at the margin of the
     last lumbar transverse process (probably through ilio-lumbar
     ligament); exit, 1 inch below and to the left of the
     umbilicus.

     The patient was wounded at 3 P.M., but not brought into the
     Field hospital until 9 P.M., when the temperature of the tents
     was below 28°F. He was considerably collapsed, suffering much
     pain, and vomited freely. The abdomen was flat, but very
     tender. Bowels confined. The column had to move at 5 A.M. the
     next morning, when the temperature was still near freezing, and
     during the day continuous fighting prevented any chance of
     operation. The man steadily sank during the day, and died
     thirty-six hours after the reception of the injury.

     Post-mortem condition.--Belly not distended, dull anteriorly
     in patches, and right flank dull throughout. When the belly was
     opened, extensive adhesion of omentum and intestine enclosing
     numerous collections of pus were disclosed, and on disturbing
     the adhesions a large collection of turbid blood-stained fluid
     was set free from the right loin. The great omentum was much
     thickened and matted, with deposition of thick patches of
     lymph; very firm recent adhesions also united numerous coils of
     small intestine. The pus was foetid, but no appreciable
     quantity of intestinal contents was detected in it. The lower
     half or more of the small intestine was injected, reddened, and
     thickened. The wounds which were situated in the lower part of
     the jejunum and ileum were multiple, and seven perforations
     were detected; besides these the intestine was marked by
     bruises, and some gutter slits affecting the serous and
     muscular coats only. Considerable ecchymosis surrounded these
     latter. The clean perforations were circular, less than 1/4
     inch in diameter, and for the most part closed by eversion of
     the mucous membrane. Intestinal contents were not apparent, but
     escaped freely on manipulation of the bowel.

     (169*) Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), over the
     eighth rib in the anterior axillary line; exit, 1 inch to the
     left of second lumbar spinous process, just below the last rib.
     Vomiting commenced almost immediately after reception of the
     injury, and the bowels acted frequently. This condition
     persisted until the fourth day, when the patient was brought
     down to Orange River, and the signs were as follows.
     Considerable pain in left half of abdomen, pulse 110, fair
     strength, temperature 101°. Some general distension of abdomen
     with complete disappearance of hepatic dulness. Some movement
     of right half of abdomen, left half immobile, dulness extending
     from the flank as far forwards as linea semilunaris. An
     incision was made in left linea semilunaris, and Oj blood
     evacuated from the left loin. There was no lymph on the
     intestines nor sign of inflammation. No perforation was
     discovered in either stomach or intestine, but on two coils of
     jejunum there were deep slits 3/4 inch long, extending through
     both peritoneal and muscular coats. Beyond these wounds, on
     other coils oval patches of ecchymosis, due to direct bruising,
     were present. The peritoneal cavity was sponged free of all
     blood and irrigated with boiled water; no bleeding point was
     discovered, and the abdomen was closed.

     The next morning the patient was comfortable; temperature
     100.2°, pulse 100. Tongue clean and moist; he vomited once
     during the night.

     Some bloody discharge had collected in the dressing, and at the
     lower angle of wound there was a local swelling, apparently in
     the abdominal wall. The flank was resonant.

     During the afternoon the patient became faint, and when seen at
     6 P.M. was in a state of collapse, in which he shortly died.

     Death was apparently due to renewal of the previous hæmorrhage.
     No post-mortem examination was made.

     (170*) Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), 1/2 inch to
     the left of the second sacral spine; exit, immediately below
     the left anterior superior iliac spine; the patient was
     kneeling at the time, and the same bullet traversed his left
     thigh in the lower third. When seen on the third day, the
     lower part of the abdomen was motionless, tumid, and tender.
     The bowels had been confined for three days; there had been no
     sickness, and the tongue was moist and clean. Temperature 100°,
     pulse 90, fair strength, respirations 38. The patient had once
     had an attack of acute appendicitis, and he himself said he was
     sure he now had 'peritonitis,' as he had pain exactly similar
     in the belly to that he had suffered in his previous illness.

     No further signs, however, developed under an expectant
     treatment, and he remained some two months in hospital, while
     the wound in the thigh and a third injury to the elbow-joint
     were healing.

     (171) Entry (Mauser), at the highest point of the left crista
     ilii; exit, through the right ilium, 2 inches horizontally
     anterior to the posterior superior spine. Absolutely no
     abdominal symptoms followed. The bowels were confined five
     days, and then opened by enema. The patient complained of some
     stiffness in the lumbo-sacral region, but the right
     synchondrosis was no doubt implicated in the track.

     (172) Wounded at Paardeberg (range 800 yards). Entry
     (Mauser), 2 inches diagonally below and to the right of the
     umbilicus; exit, not discoverable. For the first two days the
     patient had to lie out with the regiment; on the fourth he was
     removed to the Field hospital. During the first three days the
     patient vomited (green matter) frequently, and the belly was
     hard and painful; as biscuit was the only available food, no
     nourishment was taken. The bowels acted on the second night. At
     the end of a week the patient was sent by bullock wagon (three
     days and nights) to Modder River, and then down to Capetown,
     where he walked into the hospital on the thirteenth day,
     apparently well.

     Two days later the temperature rose to 104°, and enteric fever
     was diagnosed, no local signs pointing to the injury existing.
     The patient made a good recovery.

     (173) Wounded at Colenso. Entry (Mauser), at junction of
     outer 2/5 with inner 3/5 of line from right anterior superior
     iliac spine to umbilicus; exit, at upper part of right great
     sacro-sciatic foramen, in line of posterior superior iliac
     spine. Advancing on foot when struck; he then fell and crept
     fifty yards to behind a rock, where he remained seven and a
     half hours. For two days subsequently he vomited freely; the
     bowels acted nine hours after the injury, and then became
     constipated. No further symptoms were noted, and at the end of
     three weeks the abdomen was absolutely normal. The man is now
     again on active service.

     (174*) Wounded at Modder River while retiring on foot. Entry
     (Mauser), at highest point of right iliac crest; exit, 2-1/2
     inches to right of and 1/2 inch above level of umbilicus. The
     injury was not followed by sickness, and the bowels remained
     confined. During the first two days 'pain struck across the
     abdomen' when micturition was performed.

     When the patient came under observation on the third day the
     condition was as follows:--Complains of little pain,
     temperature normal, pulse 72, respirations 24, tongue moist,
     bowels confined. Rigidity of abdominal wall and deficient
     mobility of nearly whole right half of belly, the whole lower
     half of which moves little with respiration. No track palpable
     in abdominal parietes. No dulness, no distension. The
     temperature rose to 99.5° at night. On the fourth day the
     bowels acted freely, the pulse fell to 60, the respirations
     were 24, and the temperature normal.

     Tenderness and rigidity persisted in the right flank to the end
     of a week, after which time no further signs persisted.

     (175*) Wounded at Modder River while lying on right side. Range
     500 yards. Walked 400 yards after injury. Entry (Mauser), at
     the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the right
     iliac crest; exit, 3 inches to right of and 1/2 inch below
     the level of the umbilicus. The injury was followed by no signs
     of intra-abdominal lesion; on the third day the temperature was
     normal, pulse 80, and the tongue clean and moist. Some soreness
     at times and tenderness on pressure were complained of, but the
     man was discharged well at the end of one month.

     (176*) Wounded while doubling in retirement at Modder River.
     Entry (Mauser), immediately above the junction of the
     posterior and middle thirds of the left iliac crest; exit, 1
     inch below costal margin (eighth rib), 3 inches to the right of
     the median line. The bullet was lying in the anterior wound,
     whence it was removed by the orderly who applied the first
     dressing on the field. The patient remained on the field seven
     and a half hours, and when brought into hospital at once
     commenced to vomit. The ejected matter, at first green in
     colour, during the next forty-eight hours changed to a dirty
     brown. Meanwhile, the abdomen was somewhat painful. When seen
     on the third day he had ceased to vomit for three hours. The
     face was slightly anxious, and the patient lay on the ground
     with the lower extremities extended. Temperature 99°, pulse 72,
     fair strength. Respirations 32, shallow. Tongue moist, lightly
     furred, bowels not open for four days. He slept fairly last
     night. Abdomen soft, moving well with respiration, no
     distension, slight tenderness below and to the right of the
     umbilicus, and local dulness in right flank.

     The next day the pulse fell to 60 and the bowels acted, but
     there was no change in the local condition. The man looked
     somewhat ill until the end of a week, but was then sent to the
     Base, and at the expiration of a month was sent home well.

     (177*) Wounded at Modder River. Two apertures of entry
     (Mauser); (a) below cartilage of eighth rib in left nipple
     line; (b) 2 inches below and 4-1/2 inches to the left of the
     median line. No exit wound discovered, and no track could be
     palpated between the two openings, which were both circular and
     depressed. When seen on fourth day there was tenderness in the
     lower half of the abdomen, and the left thigh was held in a
     flexed position. Respirations 20, respiratory movement confined
     to upper half of abdominal wall. Pulse 70, temperature 99°.
     Tongue moist, covered with white fur; bowels confined since the
     accident; no sickness. The patient remained under observation
     thirteen days, during which time pain and difficulty in
     movement of the left thigh persisted, also slight tenderness in
     the lower part of the abdomen; but at the end of a month he was
     sent to England well, but unfit to take further part in the
     campaign. I thought the bullet might be in the left psoas, but
     it was not localised.

     (178*) Wounded at Modder River. Entry (Mauser), 3-1/2 inches
     above and 1-1/2 inch within the left anterior superior iliac
     spine; exit, 1-1/2 inch to the right of the tenth dorsal
     spinous process. The same bullet had perforated the forearm
     just above the wrist prior to entering the abdomen. No local or
     constitutional signs indicated either bowel injury or
     perforation of liver. The man, however, was suffering from a
     slight attack of dysentery, passing blood and mucus per rectum
     with great tenesmus. He was sent to the Base at the end of a
     week, and returned to England well three weeks later. He
     attributed his dysentery to the wound, as the symptoms did not
     exist prior to its reception; but as the disease coincided
     exactly with what was very prevalent amongst the troops at the
     time, I do not think there was any connection between it and
     the injury.

     (179) Wounded near Thaba-nchu. Entry, over the centre of the
     sacrum at the upper border of fourth segment; exit, 1-1/2
     inch above left Poupart's ligament, 2 inches from the median
     line. Aperture of entry oval, with long vertical axis. Exit
     wound a transverse slit, with slight tendency to starring (see
     fig. 19, p. 58). One hour after being shot the patient vomited
     once. There was some evidence of shock and considerable pain.
     The bowels acted involuntarily simultaneously with the
     vomiting, and incontinence of fæces and retention of urine
     persisted for four days. The vomit was bilious in appearance;
     no blood was seen either in it or the motions.

     Forty-six hours after the injury the condition was as follows:
     Face slightly anxious and pale; skin moist, temperature 100.4°;
     pulse 116, regular and of fair strength; respirations 24;
     abdomen slightly tumid; tenderness over lower half, especially
     on left side; the lower half moves little with respiration.

     Twenty-four hours later the patient had improved. He was
     comfortable and hopeful; slept well with morphia 1/3 grain
     hypodermically. Tongue moist, covered with white fur; has been
     taking milk only, [Symbol: ounce]ij every half-hour. No
     sickness. Temperature

     99°. Pulse 104. Respirations 24. Abdomen flatter; general
     respiratory movement; tenderness now mainly localised to an
     area 2-1/2 inches in diameter, to the left of the umbilicus,
     above exit wound.

     The patient continued to improve, and on the fifth day
     travelled six hours in a bullock wagon to Bloemfontein. Soon
     after arrival his temperature was normal: pulse 80,
     respirations 16, with good abdominal movement. Local tenderness
     persisted in the same area, but was less in degree. Tongue
     rather dry, bowels confined. Micturition normal. Two drachms of
     castor oil and an enema were given.

     On the ninth day patient was practically well, except for
     slight deep tenderness. He remained in bed on ordinary light
     diet, but at the end of the third week he was seized by a
     sudden attack of pain, the temperature rising to 103° and the
     pulse to 140, the abdomen becoming swollen and tender. He was
     then under the charge of Mr. Bowlby, who ordered some opium,
     and the symptoms rapidly subsided. Although this wound crossed
     the small intestine area, it is probable that the symptoms may
     have been due to an injury of the rectum or sigmoid flexure.

3. Wounds of the large intestine.--Injuries to every part of the large bowel were observed,
and spontaneous recoveries were seen in all parts except the transverse colon, which, as already
remarked, is near akin to the small intestine with regard to its position and anatomical arrangement.

The only case of perforation of the vermiform appendix that I heard of, one under the care
of Mr. Stonham, died of peritoneal septicæmia. Several cases of recovery from wounds of the
cæcum and ascending colon are recounted below. The only points of importance in the nature
of the signs of these injuries were their primary insignificance, and the comparative frequency
with which local peritoneal suppuration followed them. The absence of a similar sequence in
some of the cases in which wounds of the small intestine were assumed, was, in my opinion,
one of the strongest reasons for doubting the correctness of the diagnosis. It is also a significant
fact that injuries of the ascending colon--that is to say, of the portion of the large bowel
which perhaps lies most free from the area occupied by the small intestine--were those which
most frequently recovered.

The following cases afford examples of the course followed in a number of injuries to the large
intestine, and illustrate both the uncomplicated and the complicated modes of spontaneous recovery.

No. 180 affords a good example of an extra-peritoneal injury, and of the especially fatal character
of such lesions. This case was also one of my surgical disappointments.

Nos. 182, 183 are of great interest in several particulars. First, the aperture of exit was
large and allowed the escape of fæces, not a very common feature in wounds not proving immediately
fatal. Secondly, in neither were any peritoneal signs observed. Thirdly, in each the exit wound
communicated with the pleura, and the patients died from septicæmia mainly due to absorption
from the surface of that membrane (Pleural septicæmia).

No. 190 is a most striking instance of spontaneous cure, since no doubt can exist that both
rectum and bladder were perforated.

     (180*) Injury to the cæcum and ascending colon.--Boer,
     wounded at Graspan while sheltering behind a rock, lying on his
     back.

     Entry (Lee-Metford), in right thigh, 3 inches below and 1
     inch within anterior superior spine of ilium; exit, in back,
     on a level with the fourth lumbar spinous process and 3 inches
     from that point.

     Half an hour after the wound the patient commenced to suffer
     severe stabbing pain; he lay on the field one hour; later he
     was taken to a Field hospital, and on the second day was sent
     by train a distance of twenty-five miles.

     When seen at the end of fifty hours the condition was as
     follows. Face anxious, complexion dusky. Great abdominal pain,
     especially about the umbilicus. Vomiting frequent and
     distressing; bowels confined since the accident; tongue dry and
     furred. Urine scanty. Pulse full and strong, 125; respirations,
     entirely thoracic, 30.

     Abdomen generally distended and tympanitic, wall rigid and
     motionless. Dulness in right flank, together with superficial
     oedema and emphysema.

     Abdominal section fifty-three and a half hours after accident.
     Incision in right linea semilunaris. Great omentum adherent to
     ascending colon, which was covered with plastic lymph. Gas and
     intestinal contents escaped from an opening at the line of
     reflexion of the peritoneum from the ascending colon;
     retro-peritoneal extravasation and emphysema extended the whole
     length of the ascending colon and around duodenum, the wall of
     the colon itself exhibiting subperitoneal emphysema. The colon
     was freed and the rent sewn up with interrupted sutures. About
     [Symbol: ounce] iv of foul fæcal fluid were evacuated from
     loin, and a free counter-opening made. The opening in the ilium
     by which the bullet had entered the abdomen was found at the
     brim of the pelvis; the loin and peritoneal cavity were sponged
     dry and flushed with boiled water; no lymph was seen on the
     small intestine. A large gauze plug was inserted into the
     posterior wound, one end of the plug being brought out of the
     operation incision.

     During the succeeding six days progress was not unsatisfactory:
     the abdomen became soft, moved with respiration, there was no
     sickness, and the bowels acted. The pulse fell to 90,
     respirations to 20, and the temperature did not exceed 102° F.
     The wound suppurated freely, however, and although there were
     no further signs of peritoneal septicæmia, it was evident that
     general infection had taken place, and on the sixth day a
     parotid bubo developed on the right side, which was opened.

     On the seventh day the patient suddenly commenced to fail
     rapidly; vomiting was almost continuous--at first curdled milk,
     later frothy watery fluid--and on the eighth day he died. The
     abdomen remained soft, sunken, and flaccid, and death no doubt
     resulted from general septicæmia rather than from peritoneal
     infection, absorption taking place from the large foul cavity
     behind the colon. As the cavity in part surrounded the
     descending duodenum, this possibly accounted for the attack of
     vomiting which preceded death.

     (181*) Ascending colon.--Wounded at Graspan while lying in
     prone position. Entry (Mauser), over ninth rib in line of
     right linea semilunaris; exit, in right buttock, just below
     and behind the top of the great trochanter.

     The injury was followed by little abdominal pain, but a strange
     sensation of local gurgling was noted. The bowels acted as soon
     as the patient reached camp, some hours after being wounded.
     There was no sickness and nothing abnormal was noted in the
     motions, except that they were loose and light-coloured.

     On the evening of the third day the patient came under
     observation in the ambulance train for Capetown. He looked
     somewhat anxious and ill, but he complained of little pain; the
     temperature was 102°, pulse 88, fair strength, soft and
     regular. There was local dulness, tenderness, and deficiency of
     movement in the right iliac region. As it was night, he was
     removed from the train and an operation was performed the next
     morning.

     Prior to operation the condition was as follows: Pulse 84,
     temperature 100°; respiration easy, 20. Tongue moist, but
     thickly coated in centre. Abdomen moves fairly, and is
     resonant, except in right lower quadrant. No distension.
     Dulness, tenderness, and rigidity in right iliac region, marked
     to outer side of cæcum. Entry wound nearly and exit quite
     healed. Cannot flex right thigh. The following operation was
     performed. Appendix incision, about [Symbol: ounce]j of fæcal
     fluid and fæces in a localised cavity on outer and anterior
     aspect of cæcum evacuated; adhesions very firm. Cavity sloughy
     throughout and cæcum covered with dull grey lymph. The opening
     in the bowel was not localised, and it was considered wiser to
     treat the case like one of perforation from appendicitis than
     to run the risk of breaking down adhesions. A small awl-like
     opening was found in the ilium with powdered bone at its
     entrance leading to the wound of exit.

     The after-treatment of the case gave rise to no anxiety, but
     healing of the resulting sinus was slow; fæcal-smelling pus
     escaped for some days, and a number of small sloughs came away.
     On the twelfth day the patient was sent down to Wynberg, where
     he remained twelve weeks. A counter-incision was needed in the
     loin to drain the suppurating cavity three weeks after the
     primary operation, and five weeks after the operation an escape
     of gas and fæces took place from the anterior wound, while the
     bowels were acting, as a result of a dose of castor oil. No
     further escape of fæces occurred, and he left for England with
     a small sinus only. No extension of inflammation into the
     original wound track ever occurred, both openings and the canal
     healing by primary union.

     The sinus remained open, and occasionally discharged for a
     further period of six months, and then healed firmly; since
     when the patient has been in perfect health.

     (182*) Splenic flexure, descending colon.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), in sixth left intercostal
     space in mid-axillary line; exit, in left loin, below last
     rib, at outer margin of erector spinæ. The patient remained in
     the Field hospital three days, during which time he exhibited
     no serious abdominal symptoms, but during the journey to Orange
     River (53-1/2 miles) he was sick. He remained at Orange River
     two days, and while there an enema was administered, producing
     a normal motion. The abdomen was slightly distended; it moved
     fairly, there was slight rigidity, but little tenderness.
     Temperature 100.8°, pulse 120. No appearance of fæces in wound.

     When seen on the sixth day the condition was as
     follows:--Patient cheerful and not in great pain. Temperature
     99.2°; pulse 120; respirations 48, very shallow. Abdomen soft,
     moving freely, no distension or general tenderness. Fluid fæces
     escaping in abundance from the wound in loin. Redness of skin
     and swelling below level of wound, and cellular emphysema
     above. Fæcal-smelling fluid was also escaping from the thoracic
     wound.

     The wound was enlarged, but the patient rapidly sank, and died
     of septicæmia on the seventh day.

     (183*) An exactly similar case came under observation from the
     battle of Modder River, except that the opening in the loin was
     somewhat larger, and earlier and freer escape of fæces took
     place from it. In this also fæcal matter passed freely into the
     left pleural cavity, and fæcal matter was expectorated, while
     there was an almost complete absence of abdominal symptoms.
     Death occurred on the fourth day.

     No post-mortem examination was made in either case, but I
     believe in both the extra-peritoneal aspect of the colon was
     implicated and that the septicæmia was in great part due to
     absorption from the pleural rather than the peritoneal cavity,
     since in neither case were the abdominal symptoms a prominent
     feature.

     (184) Possible wound of cæcum.--Wounded at Spion Kop. Bullet
     (Mauser) perforated the right forearm, then entered belly.
     Entry, 3 inches from the right anterior superior iliac spine,
     in the line of the supra-pubic fold of the belly wall (a
     transverse slit); exit, in right buttock, on a level with the
     tip of the great trochanter and 2 inches within it. The wound
     was received immediately after breakfast had been eaten. There
     was retention of urine and constipation for three days, but no
     sickness. Local pain and tenderness were severe, and at the end
     of three weeks there was still local tenderness, slight
     induration, and dragging pain on defæcation. The patient
     returned to England at the end of a month well, except for
     slight local tenderness.

     (185) Possible wound of colon.--Wounded at Paardeberg; range
     200 yards. Walking at time. The bullet (Mauser) perforated the
     left forearm, just below the elbow-joint. Entry, into belly 1
     inch anterior to the tip of the left eleventh costal cartilage;
     no exit.

     The injury was followed by pain in the left half of the abdomen
     and vomiting, which continued for two days. The bowels acted on
     the third day; no nourishment was taken for two days, but a
     small quantity of water was allowed. No further symptoms were
     noted, and at the end of a fortnight the patient was well,
     except for slight local tenderness. The bullet could not be
     detected with the X-rays.

     (186) Wound of cæcum.--Wounded at Paardeberg. Entry
     (Mauser), 2 inches diagonally above and within right anterior
     superior iliac spine; exit, immediately to the right of the
     fifth lumbar spinous process; the patient was lying on his left
     side when struck. A burning pain down the right thigh
     immediately followed the accident, and lasted some days. There
     was no sickness, the bowels were confined three days, and there
     was pain across the back and down the thigh.

     On the tenth day he arrived at the Base, when he was lying on
     his back suffering considerable pain. The temperature ranged to
     101°. There was diarrhoea and cystitis, with a considerable
     amount of pus in the urine, which was very offensive. A small
     fluctuating spot existed on the back, just to the right of the
     original exit wound which was firmly healed. The abdomen moved
     fairly with respiration in its upper part, but was motionless
     below, especially in the right iliac fossa; some induration was
     to be felt here. The right thigh was kept flexed.

     During the next few days the pus disappeared from the urine,
     and with this change the induration in the right iliac fossa
     increased. An incision (Mr. Gairdner) was made into the
     fluctuating spot behind, and pus evacuated. The patient
     recovered.

     (187) Possible wound of cæcum.--Wounded outside Heilbron. There was little shock. The patient was brought six
     miles in a wagon into camp, and slept comfortably with a small
     morphia injection. Prior to the accident the patient was
     suffering from diarrhoea, but afterwards the bowels were
     confined. The next morning there had been no sickness and
     little pain. The tongue was moist and clean, the pulse 80, the
     respirations 24, the belly moved generally, although
     inspiration was shallow; the temperature was 99°. Slight
     tenderness in the belly to the inner side of the exit wound,
     but no dulness.

     The patient was starved for the first thirty-six hours, a
     little warm water then being allowed. No symptoms developed,
     and a perfect recovery followed.

     (188) Colon, liver.--Wounded outside Heilbron. Entry
     (Mauser), midway between the last right rib and the crista
     ilii; exit, below the eighth costal cartilage in nipple line.
     There were no serious primary symptoms, but ten days after the
     accident the temperature rose, swelling and pain developed in
     the right loin, and on the fourteenth day a large tympanitic
     abscess was opened (Dr. Flockemann, German Ambulance.)
     Fæcal-smelling gas and pus were evacuated. There was no
     extension of the abscess forwards. A week later the patient had
     much improved, although there were evident signs of general
     absorption, and the discharge from the abscess cavity was
     abundant and very foul. On the thirteenth day a serious
     hæmorrhage occurred from the loin wound, which was opened up,
     but no evident source was discovered; hæmorrhage was repeated
     the next day, and the man died.

     At the post-mortem examination a large quantity of
     chocolate-coloured fluid was found free in the abdomen and
     pelvis. A chain of small local abscesses was found surrounding
     the ascending colon, and a larger one over the front of the
     cæcum. The wall of the ascending colon was generally thickened,
     and from this, in three places, openings with rounded margins
     connected the abscess cavities with the lumen of the bowel. One
     of the openings, larger than the others, was possibly the
     aperture of entry of the bullet; the others were apparently
     spontaneous.

     At the anterior border of the right lobe of the liver an
     abscess cavity existed in connection with the wound of the
     liver, and this was continuous with the aperture of exit,
     although not discharging. The aperture of exit was plugged by a
     tag of omentum (see fig. 89). No obvious source of the
     hæmorrhage was forthcoming, but it probably originated in one
     of the large branches of the vena cava. The bullet had struck
     the transverse process of the lumbar vertebra, but had not
     given rise to any signs of spinal concussion.

     (189*) Ascending colon.--Wounded at Modder River. Entry
     (Mauser), midway between the tip of the tenth right rib and the
     iliac crest. Bullet retained. A second wound existed over the
     centre of the left sterno-mastoid, and the bullet here was also
     retained and never localised. The patient stated that he
     brought up blood at short intervals for half an hour
     immediately after he was wounded. This might have been
     explained by the wound in the neck, but no difficulty in
     swallowing was noted. The bowels acted the day after he was
     shot, and, except for some local tenderness and immobility, no
     abdominal signs were noted. Three weeks later a swelling was
     obvious to the right side of the umbilicus, and a tympanitic
     abscess developed; this was opened, and a deformed Mauser
     bullet extracted. Foul pus, but no fæcal matter, was evacuated,
     and after discharging for a fortnight the wound closed, and the
     man was sent home as 'well.' In this case I assumed a wound of
     the ascending colon had occurred.

     (190*) Rectum and bladder.--Wounded at Graspan, while
     retiring at the double. Entry (Mauser), 1 inch to the right
     of the coccyx; exit, 1 inch above the junction of the middle
     and outer thirds of left Poupart's ligament. The man suffered
     with some pain in the abdomen, and for first two days with
     retention of urine. The urine was drawn off with the catheter,
     and contained blood. During the next five days micturition was
     hourly or more frequent; gas was passed per urethram, and the
     urine was very foul, containing evident fæcal matter.
     Micturition continued frequent, with purulent cystitis for one
     month. Local tenderness, pain, and immobility developed over
     the lower quarter of the abdomen, extending to the right iliac
     fossa. A local abscess pointed a little to the right of the mid
     line, and 2 inches above the symphysis, and from this
     foul-smelling pus, but no fæces, was discharged for three
     months, during which period the surrounding dulness and
     induration gradually decreased and the sinus healed. When the
     patient left for England there was still occasional slight
     discharge from the original wound of entry, and there was
     slight discomfort on micturition, but he was otherwise well.

     A year later the man had resumed active duty, and, except for
     occasional pain on stooping, considered himself well.

The following cases are appended as of some general interest. The first two (191, 192) illustrate
extra-peritoneal injuries to the rectum. In neither did positive evidence exist of wound of
the bowel, but the symptoms in each rendered this accident probable. Case 193 is an illustration
of apparent escape of the anal canal in a wound in which from the position of the external
apertures this escape would have appeared impossible.

Wounds of the extra-peritoneal portion of the rectum, as a rule, appeared to have a somewhat
better prognosis than would have been expected; in any case, the prognosis was far better than
that obtaining in wounds of the base of the urinary bladder. My experience on the subject of
these wounds was, however, limited to the two cases quoted.

Case 194 is inserted as an example of the complicated nature of the abdominal injuries not
so very unfrequently met with. It illustrates well the difficulty which may arise at any stage
in the course of treatment of an injury, in the certain determination or exclusion of wound
of a part of the alimentary canal.

     (191) Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), in the right
     loin, immediately below the ribs in the mid-axillary line;
     exit, about the centre of the left buttock, on a level with
     the tip of the great trochanter. A second lacerated shell wound
     of back was present. All the wounds suppurated. For the first
     sixteen days following the injury all control was lost over the
     anal sphincter, and bloody fæces, and later slime, constantly
     escaped, but no fæcal matter ever escaped from the wound in the
     buttock. There was no history of previous dysentery, and rectal
     examination afforded no information. The buttock wound had to
     be opened up, disclosing a tunnel in the ilium.

     The wounds granulated slowly with continuous suppuration, but
     were healed, and the patient returned home at the end of
     fourteen weeks, the bowels acting normally.

     (192) Wounded at Paardeberg. After the injury retention of urine followed, with
     incapacity to control loose motions, though solid ones could be
     retained. The retention was treated by catheterisation, which
     was followed by cystitis. The power of micturition was slowly
     recovered, and three weeks later he could pass water, at times
     in a dribbling stream only; the cystitis had improved. The man
     returned to England very much improved, but not quite well, at
     the end of five weeks.

     (193) Wounded at Modder River. Entry, in the right buttock,
     near the outer border at the upper part; exit, at the lower
     part of outer border of left buttock. The line of the wound
     exactly crossed the position of the anus, but no sign of injury
     to the rectum could be discovered.

     (194) Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), 1/2 inch
     below the margin of the iliac crest, at the junction of its
     middle and posterior thirds, and on a level with the fifth
     lumbar spinous process; exit, below the cartilage of the
     eighth rib, just within the left nipple line. Struck while
     retiring; fell at once, and remained thirty hours on the field.
     Patient stated that he vomited 'blood like coffee grounds' six
     times while lying on the field, and twice after being brought
     in. His bowels were confined for three days. His right lower
     extremity was paralysed.

     On the fifth day there was considerable induration around the
     wound of exit, and the upper half of the abdomen was immobile
     and tender. The temperature rose to 100°, and the pulse was 96.
     Shortly afterwards a similar condition was noted in the lower
     half of the abdomen; the temperature continued to be raised and
     the pulse quickened, when on the thirteenth day a considerable
     quantity of pus was passed per rectum, and diarrhoea set in;
     this continued for three days, with marked improvement in the
     general symptoms. Micturition, which had been painful, became
     normal; the pulse and temperature fell, and the expression
     became less anxious. The patient continued to sleep badly,
     however, and complained of pain.

     At the end of the third week he still looked ill, but was
     easier. Temperature normal in the morning, 100° in evening,
     pulse 80. Tongue thickly furred, but moist. Still on milk diet;
     appetite bad; bowels irregular.

     The abdomen moved little in the lower half, induration
     persisted in the left iliac fossa, the left thigh continued
     flexed, and resonance was impaired to the left of the
     umbilicus.

     At the end of six weeks a distinct hard swelling in two parts,
     separated by a resonant area, was noted to the left of the
     umbilicus and in the left iliac fossa. The abdomen moved
     fairly, and there was little tenderness over the swelling.
     During the next week the swelling appeared to increase and to
     fluctuate; at the same time the temperature again began to rise
     to 100° and 101° at eve. The swelling was taken to be a
     localised peritoneal suppuration, and an incision was made over
     it; but this led down to a free peritoneal cavity, with a
     tumour pressing up from the posterior abdominal wall. The wound
     was therefore closed, and a fresh extra-peritoneal incision
     made, immediately above Poupart's ligament, when the swelling
     proved to be a large retro-peritoneal hæmatoma. As the cavity
     extended into the pelvis and up to the level of the costal
     margin, it was deemed wise only to evacuate a part of the
     blood-clot. The origin of the bleeding was not determined, and
     the wound was closed and healed by first intention. The man
     continued to improve, and left for home five weeks later.

     This patient has continued to improve since his return, but the
     left thigh is still somewhat flexed.

Prognosis in intestinal injuries.--This was of a most discouraging character compared with
the prognosis in abdominal injuries as a whole. The cases were of two classes, however: those
that died within twenty-four hours, and those that died at the end of from three days to a week.

Cases falling into the first category are obviously of little importance from the point of
view of surgical treatment. Many of them died from the widespread nature of the injury, and
the shock produced by it; others from hæmorrhage from the large abdominal vessels. It is unlikely
that any could have been saved, even under the most satisfactory conditions.

In the following small table, therefore, I have included only the cases which have been already
quoted, which survived long enough to be amenable to surgical treatment, and which were for
some days under my own observation. Some of them, in fact almost all, I watched until they
were either convalescent, or died, and in six I performed operations.

I am aware, and have short details of the histories of eight patients wounded in the same battles
who died prior to the termination of the first thirty-six hours; but these are not included,
for the reason stated above, and also because I am uncertain whether all the injuries were
produced by bullets of small calibre.

Included in the above table are thirty instances of intestinal injury, and these are divided
up according to the segment of the intestinal canal implicated, and also as to whether the
perforation was certain, or only assumed from the position of the external apertures and the
presence of abdominal symptoms of a noticeable grade.

From this analysis it appears clear--

1. That wounds of the stomach have a comparatively good prognosis, and that they may recover
spontaneously. It is true that only two examples are included in my table; but I was at various
times shown patients with similar injuries and histories, and a number of cases which have
been published appear to substantiate the opinion. From our experience of the occasional spontaneous
recovery of gastric perforations from disease, I think we might be prepared to expect that
the stomach would offer a comparatively favourable seat for these wounds. It may be pointed
out, however, that hæmatemesis, the main feature in the symptoms pointing to wound, is by no
means direct proof of more than contusion.

2. That perforating wounds of the small intestine are very fatal injuries; every patient in
whom the condition was certainly diagnosed died.

3. That in the cases in which a perforation was inferred from the position of the external
apertures and the symptoms, not one patient suffered from the secondary complications--e.g.
local peritonitis and suppuration, which were common in the case of the large intestine, and
which we are accustomed to see after perforation from disease. This renders the occurrence
of actual perforation in the majority of the cases a matter of very grave doubt.

If spontaneous recovery does take place after this injury, it is only in cases in which the
wounds are single, and slight in character.

4. That in eight cases in which perforation of the large intestine was certain, four recoveries
took place; but in each instance suppuration occurred. I am, however, quite prepared to believe
that perforation may have occurred in some or all of the other four cases included as 'possible,'
provided the wounds were intra-peritoneal.

Wounds of the cæcum and ascending colon are those which have the best prognosis, and after
these of the rectum. The comparatively good prognosis in these parts is what would be expected,
on account of their greater fixity, and lesser tendency to be covered by the small intestine.

An extra-peritoneal wound of any of these portions of the bowel is more dangerous than an intra-peritoneal,
and more likely to give rise to septicæmia.

Of the cases included in my table eighteen of the possible intestinal injuries were observed
among the wounded of the four battles of the Kimberley relief force. These cases I saw early
and followed to their termination, and I believe the list contains the great majority of all
the patients who received intestinal wounds in those battles. On inquiry I could not learn
of others from the officers of the Field hospitals; but no doubt some patients died before
their reception into hospital, and some may have been overlooked; again, I know of two cases
in which death took place within the first week, but which went direct to the Base and did
not come under my observation. These exceptions being made, we have a fairly complete series,
from which some deductions may be drawn. The cases included are marked with an asterisk.

Of the eighteen cases, eight or 44.4 per cent. died. These were made up as follows:--Stomach,
one case; this patient died at the end of fourteen days, as a result of secondary hæmorrhage
and septicæmia. It was complicated by a severe wound of the liver and also one of the lung.

Small intestine, four certain cases; all died, two after operation in the stage of septicæmia,
and one after operation from recurrent hæmorrhage, possibly from the mesentery. Of the other
six cases one can only say that the position of the wounds was such as to render wound of the
intestine possible, and that all suffered with abdominal symptoms of some severity.

Large intestine. Of six cases in which wound was certain, three died, one after operation.
One recovered after operation, two recovered with local peritoneal suppuration. In one case
the injury could only be returned as possible.

In connection with this subject I have received permission from Mr. Watson Cheyne to quote
the statistics published by him[23] concerning the abdominal wounds observed after the fighting
at Karree Siding, on March 29, which are as follows:--

     'The number of the wounded was 154, and in fifteen it was
     considered that the abdominal cavity had been penetrated. Of
     these patients, five had already died within twenty-four to
     twenty-eight hours after the injury, and I saw ten who were
     still alive. Of these nine were left alone, and four died
     within the next twenty-four or thirty-six hours; five were
     still alive when I left Karee on Sunday afternoon, April 1. On
     one I operated, but he died on April 2.

     The Karee statistics are really the only complete ones which I
     have as yet been able to obtain. The following are the notes of
     the cases above alluded to.

     Besides the five cases of abdominal wounds which had already
     died, and of which I could get no complete details, the
     following ten are cases which I saw from twenty-four to thirty
     hours after they were  shot:--

CASES FROM THE ACTION AT KAREE

     CASE I.--The point of entrance was 2 inches to the right of the
     umbilicus, and the bullet was found lying under the skin far
     back in the left loin. The patient was pulseless, and there was
     much rigidity of the abdomen, tenderness, and vomiting. He died
     a few hours later.

     CASE II.--The bullet, coming from the side, had entered the
     abdomen 4 inches below and behind the right nipple. There was
     no exit wound. The patient had been vomiting a good deal, but
     not any blood; the abdomen was very rigid and tender. He was
     obviously very ill, and died the next morning. The bullet had
     probably perforated the liver and stomach.

     CASE III.--There was a large wound above the right anterior
     iliac spine (probably the point of exit), and a small opening
     behind and near the spine on the same side. There was great
     tenderness and rigidity of the abdomen. He died a few hours
     later.

     CASE IV.--In this case there was a transverse wound of the
     abdomen, the bullet having entered on the right side in the
     middle of the lumbar region and passed out on the left side,
     rather higher up and further back. All the symptoms of acute
     peritonitis were present. The patient died the next morning.

     CASE V.--The bullet had entered the anterior end of the sixth
     intercostal space on the left side, and was found lying under
     the skin over the seventh intercostal space on the right side
     and about 2 inches further back. He had vomited blood on the
     previous day. The bullet may have perforated the stomach. The
     epigastrium was somewhat tender, but there were no marked
     symptoms. On April 1 he was going on well.

     CASE VI.--The place of entrance of the bullet was 1 inch in
     front of the right anterior superior spine, and of exit behind
     the left sacro-iliac synchondrosis. There was much hæmorrhage
     at the time. His condition when I saw him was fair, and there
     was no marked abdominal tenderness. On April 1 his morning
     temperature was 101°. There were no signs of general
     peritonitis, and his condition was good.

     CASE VII.--The bullet had entered from behind, about the tip of
     the twelfth rib on the left side, and had left about the middle
     of the epigastrium, and rather to the left of the middle line.

     Vomiting was still going on, but not of blood. There was much
     tenderness and rigidity of the abdomen, and he was almost
     pulseless. On April 1 his general condition was better, but the
     abdomen was very rigid and tender. (Subsequently died.)

     CASE VIII.--The point of entrance of the bullet was about 2
     inches from the anterior end of the seventh left intercostal
     space, and of exit rather lower down and further back on the
     right side. The patient said that he had vomited brown fluid
     after the injury. There was much abdominal pain, but his
     general condition was fair. On April 1 there was still much
     pain, but his general condition was good.

     CASE IX.--The bullet had entered about 1-1/2 inch in front of
     the anterior inferior spine on the right side, had gone
     directly backwards, and had come out in the buttock. The
     patient, however, suffered very little. On March 31 there was
     slight tympanites and tenderness in the right iliac fossa. The
     bowels acted well, and no blood was passed. On April 1 he was
     very well, and it was considered very doubtful if any viscus
     was wounded.

     CASE X.--The point of entrance was in the middle of the right
     buttock, a little above the level of the trochanter; the exit
     was through the anterior abdominal wall in the right semilunar
     line at the level of the umbilicus. The patient was decidedly
     ill; the abdomen was a good deal distended, and pressure on it
     caused an escape of gas through the anterior opening. There was
     a good deal of abdominal tenderness and rigidity. I opened the
     abdomen outside the right linea semilunaris, and found a
     perforation in the anterior wall of the ascending colon,
     without any adhesions around, which was easily stitched up. The
     posterior opening was found about 2 inches lower down, with a
     piece of omentum firmly adherent to it and completely closing
     it. As the patient was in a bad state, I thought it better,
     instead of excising the piece of intestine beyond the holes or
     tearing off the omentum, to leave the wounds alone, merely
     cleaning out the peritoneal cavity as well as I could and
     arranging for free drainage. He rallied from the operation very
     well, and for twenty-four hours it looked as if he might get
     better; but he gradually got worse and died on April 2.'

The above statistics are particularly valuable, as they give the incidence of abdominal injuries
compared with those in general in one definite battle. This amounted to the high number of
15 in 154 or 9.74 per cent. wounded. I am inclined to think that this is a higher proportion
than the average of the campaign, and that more of the men must have been exposed in the erect
position than was ordinarily the case during the fighting.

The statistics also show that 33.33 per cent. of the patients with abdominal injuries died
within from twenty-four to twenty-eight hours, and that the percentage of deaths had risen
to 73.33 per cent. at the end of the third day. These numbers again seem high, but in this
relation it may be noted that, as a small force only was present, and as all the patients were
together, Mr. Cheyne had unusually good opportunities for seeing all the cases.

One other point is doubtful from the report, and that is what percentage of the wounds were
caused by bullets of small calibre. In one case it is definitely stated that the wound was
large, and in the second that gas escaped from the wound; both of these may have been instances
in which a large bullet, or some expanding form, had been employed, and there is no doubt that
the use of such projectiles was more common at this stage of the campaign than it was earlier.

Treatment of injuries to the intestine.--Some general rules for the immediate treatment of
all cases may be laid down. First, the patients must be removed with as little disturbance
as possible, and absolute starvation must be insisted upon. If the patients be suffering from
severe shock, hypodermic injections of strychnine should be administered, or possibly some
stimulant by the rectum.

After a battle, when these cases may be brought in in considerable number, they should be collected
and placed in the same tent. The objection to congregating a number of severely wounded patients
together must be disregarded in the face of the manifest advantage of being able to treat all
alike in the matter of feeding. After the battles of the Kimberley relief force, Surgeon-General
Wilson, at my request, had all the abdominal cases placed in a large marquee, where we were
able to carefully watch the whole of the patients from hour to hour, and little chance existed
for any indiscretion on the part of the patients in the way of eating or drinking.

If possible, the patients should be kept absolutely quiet until they are evidently out of danger.
A week's stay at Orange River sufficed for this object in the cases referred to. The avoidance
of transport is manifestly of extreme prognostic importance.

When feeding is commenced at the end of twenty-four or thirty-six hours, it must be in the
form at first of warm water, then milk administered in tea-spoonfuls only.

In doubtful cases the use of morphia must be avoided.

Operative treatment is required in a certain number of the cases, but in the majority of instances
we are met with the extreme difficulty that in a very large proportion of the occasions upon
which these wounds are received an exploratory abdominal section is not warranted in consequence
of the conditions under which it has to be performed.

A word must be added as to these difficulties; they are in part purely of an administrative
nature, partly surgical. After a great battle the wounded are numerous, and amongst them a
very considerable proportion of the wounds and injuries are of such a nature as to do extremely
well if promptly dealt with, and each of these makes small demands on the time of the staff.
Abdominal operations, on the other hand, are unsatisfactory from a prognostic point of view,
and their performance requires much time and the assistance of a considerable number of the
men, who are obliged to neglect the treatment of the more promising cases for those of doubtful
issue. This difficulty, although not surgical in its nature, is nevertheless a practical one
of great importance and appeals strongly to the Principal Medical Officers in charge of the
arrangements. It is only to be avoided by an increase of the staff, which is not likely to
be made except on very special occasions.

Other difficulties are purely surgical. First, the difficulty of diagnosing with certainty
a perforating lesion. In the presence of the fact that many incomplete lesions follow wounds
crossing the intestinal area, and that these give rise to modified symptoms, I believe this
determination to be impossible without the aid of an exploratory incision. Here we are met
with the remaining surgical difficulties--disadvantages such as the absence of sufficient aid
to the operating surgeon, difficulties connected with the temperature, wind, and dust, and
as to the subsequent treatment of the patient. Again difficulty in obtaining the most important
adjunct, suitable water, or indeed any water in a sufficient quantity.

It is of course obvious that conditions may exist in which all these troubles may be avoided.
Again, the practical difficulty adverted to above does not come in the way when a single man
happens to sustain an abdominal wound on the march. Under such circumstances an exploration
may be not only justifiable, but obligatory, and the general rules of surgery must be followed
rather than such incomplete indications as are suggested below.

My own experience led me to the following conclusions:

1. A wound in the intestinal area should be watched with care. In the face of the numerous
recoveries in such cases, habitual abdominal exploration is not justified, under the conditions
usually prevailing in the field.

2. The very large class of patients excluded by this rule from operation leads us to a smaller
and less satisfactory number to be divided into two categories:

Patients who die during the first twelve hours. The whole of these are naturally unfit for
operation, and their general condition when seen often precludes any thought of it.

Patients with very severe injuries, as evidenced by the escape of fæces, or with wounds from
flank to flank or taking an antero-posterior course in the small intestinal area. These patients
die, and the majority of them will always die whether operated upon or not. The undertaking
of operations upon them is unpleasant to the surgeon, as being unlikely to be attended with
any great degree of success, whence the impression may gain ground that patients are killed
by the operations. None the less, I think these operations ought to be undertaken when the
attendant conditions allow, and it is from this class of case that the real successes will
be drawn in the future. The history of such injuries, after all, corresponds exactly with what
we were long familiar with in traumatic ruptures in civil practice, and now know may be avoided
by a sufficiently early interference. The whole question here is one of time, and this will
always be the trouble in military work.

3. The expectant attitude which is obligatory under the above rules in doubtful cases, brings
us face to face with a large proportion of patients in the early or late stage of peritoneal
septicæmia. These cases run on exactly the same lines as those in which the same condition
is secondary to spontaneous perforation of the bowel, in which we consider it our duty to operate,
and in which a definite percentage of recoveries is obtained. Hence another unpleasant duty
is here imposed upon the surgeon. Two such cases on which I operated are recounted above, and
although I cannot say they give much encouragement, I should add that in the only one I left
untouched, I regretted my want of courage for the five days during which the patient continued
to carry on a miserable existence.

4. The treatment of the cases in which an expectant attitude is followed by the advent of localised
suppuration presents no difficulty; simple incision alone is needed, and healing follows.

As a rule this is a late condition. In one case of injury to the ascending colon recounted
above, however, considerable local escape of fæces had occurred, and a successful result was
obtained by a local incision on the third day without suture of the bowel. In this case I believe
the wound in the bowel to have been of the nature of a long slit, but the surrounding adhesions
were so firm as to render any interference with them a great risk, and a successful result
was obtained at the cost of a somewhat prolonged recovery. I am convinced that the best course
was followed here. (No. 131.)

When the suppuration was of a less acute character, it was generally advisable to allow the
pus to make its way towards the surface before interference.

5. Cases of injury to the colon in which the posterior aspect is involved should be treated
by free opening up of the wound, and either by suture of the bowel or else its fixation to
the surface. I operated on one such case, and although the patient eventually died on the eighth
day, from septicæmia, he certainly had a chance. Two cases where the opening looked so free
that one almost thought the wound could be regarded as a lumbar colotomy did badly; in both
infection of the pleura took place, besides extension of suppuration into the retro-peritoneal
areolar tissue. In the future I should always feel inclined to enlarge such wounds and bring
the bowel to the surface.

As regards actual technique the majority of the wounds are particularly well suited to suture;
three stitches across the opening and one at either end of the resulting crease sufficed to
close the opening effectively. The openings in the small intestine were not as a rule difficult
to find, on account of the ecchymosis which surrounded them. From what I have seen stated in
the reports given by other surgeons, there seems to have been more difficulty in discovering
wounds in the large gut. Under ordinary circumstances the only instruments specially needed
are a needle and some silk. At my first two operations, as my instruments had gone astray,
the wounds were readily closed by a needle and cotton borrowed from the wife of a railway porter.

If aseptic sponges or pads are not available, boiled squares of ordinary lint may be employed
for the belly, and towels wrung out of 1 to 20 carbolic acid solution used to surround the
field of operation. Whenever there is any likelihood of the necessity for operations, water
boiled and filtered should be kept ready in special bottles.

When septic peritonitis was already present, the ordinary procedure of dry mopping, followed
by irrigation, was necessary, before closing the belly.

The after-treatment should be on the usual lines as to feeding, &c.

I am unaware to what degree success followed intestinal operations generally during the campaign.
I saw only one case in which the small intestine had been treated by excision and the insertion
of a Murphy's button in which a cure followed: this case was in the Scottish Royal Red Cross
hospital under the care of Mr. Luke. I heard of two cases in which the large intestine was
successfully sutured, and of one other in which recovery followed the removal of a considerable
length of the small bowel for multiple wounds.

In concluding these most unsatisfactory remarks, I should add that the impressions are those
that were gained as the result of the conditions by which we were bound in South Africa, and
which might recur even in a more civilised region. Under really satisfactory conditions nothing
I saw in my South African experience would lead me to recommend any deviation from the ordinary
rules of modern surgery, except in so far as I should be more readily inclined to believe that
wounds in certain positions already indicated might occur without perforation of the bowel
when produced by bullets of small calibre; and further in cases where I believed the fixed
portion of the large bowel was the segment of the alimentary canal that had been exposed to
risk, I should not be inclined to operate hastily.

A careful consideration of the whole of the cases that I saw leaves me with the firm impression
that perforating wounds of the small intestine differ in no way in their results and consequences
when produced by small-calibre bullets, from those of every-day experience, although when there
is reason merely to suspect their presence an exploration is not indicated under circumstances
that may add a fresh danger to the patient.

Wounds of the urinary bladder.--Perforating wounds of the bladder are the injuries nearest
akin to those we have just considered, but a great gulf separates them, in so far as the escape
of a few drops or even a considerable quantity of normal urine does not necessarily mean peritoneal
infection. The difference in this particular was very forcibly demonstrated in my experience,
since an uncomplicated perforation of the bladder in the intra-peritoneal portion of the viscus
proved to be an injury that not infrequently recovered spontaneously, I believe in a considerable
proportion of the cases.

I include only one such case in my list because it was the only example which happened to be
under my personal observation during its whole course, but from time to time I was shown several
others in which the position of the external apertures and the transient presence of hæmaturia
left little doubt as to the nature of the injury. The case recounted above, No. 190, is of
especial interest, since the patient recovered from an injury which involved both the bladder
and a fixed portion of the large intestine in contact with its posterior surface.

In another, No. 194, a transient inflammatory thickening pointed to a local inflammation of
a non-infective character, since no suppuration ensued, and this may have been a case of extra-peritoneal
wound; on the other hand, the bladder may have entirely escaped injury. In wounds of the portions
of the viscus not clad in peritoneum, as a rule, a very different prognosis obtains. Two typical
cases are related, which I believe fairly represent the general results which follow when the
bladder is either wounded behind the symphysis or at the base. The first case, No. 195, exemplifies
a very characteristic form of wound when small-calibred bullets are concerned. The bullet,
taking a course more or less parallel to that of the wall of the viscus, cut a long slit in
its anterior wall. This bullet in its onward passage comminuted the horizontal ramus of the
pubes, and lodged in the thigh. Into the latter region the greater part of the extravasated
urine escaped. I think the history of this case fully shows that I made a blunder in not performing
a proper exploration, instead of contenting myself with an incision in the thigh. My only excuse
was that the patient at the time I saw him was in a very collapsed state, and a severe grade
of abdominal distension suggested that septic peritonitis was already in an advanced stage.
In point of fact, the patient at once improved, sufficiently so to be able to undergo a second
exploration at a later date by Mr. Hanwell at the Base, only dying of septicæmia at the end
of twenty-one days. Even a free supra-pubic vent might, I believe, have given him a chance of life.

When the perforation was at the base of the bladder, however, the prognosis was very bad, and,
as far as I know, not a single patient escaped death. The increase of risk in an extra-peritoneal
wound of this viscus is indeed very great, while an intra-peritoneal perforation may be considered
an injury of lesser severity, provided the urine be of normal character.

     (194a) Possible wound of the bladder.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), immediately above the
     symphysis pubis; exit, in the buttock, behind the tip of the
     left great trochanter. The man was struck while advancing, and
     fell, thinking at the time 'that he was struck in the foot.' He
     lay twelve hours on the field, and passed water for the first
     time when the bearer removed him. During the next two days he
     passed urine only twice, and no blood was noticed. The bowels
     acted on the evening of the third day. When seen on the fourth
     day he complained of aching pain in the lower part of the
     belly, and a concentric patch of tender induration extended for
     about 1-1/2 inch around the wound. The abdominal wall was
     moving well. The tongue was clean and moist. There was no blood
     in the urine, and micturition was not frequent. Temperature
     99.4°. Pulse 80, good strength. The patient was then sent to
     the Base. At the end of seventeen days there was still a little
     tenderness in the left iliac fossa; but the man was otherwise
     well, and at the end of a month he was sent home.

     (195) Extra-peritoneal wound of the bladder.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), at the fore part of the right
     buttock. No exit. The patient was seen on the third day. He had
     an expression of extreme anxiety, and complained of very great
     pain in the abdomen and thigh. The abdomen was greatly
     distended and tympanitic, and the left thigh and groin were
     very much swollen and oedematous, with some redness of
     surface. Temperature 100°, pulse 120. No sickness, tongue
     moist, bowels confined. Retention of urine. The condition of
     the patient was very grave; but he was anæsthetised, clear
     urine was withdrawn from the bladder by catheter, and an
     incision was made into the thigh just below the inner third of
     Poupart's ligament, where fluctuation was evident. Two pints of
     bloody urine were evacuated, and when a finger was introduced
     it passed over a fracture of the pubes into the pelvis, but not
     into the peritoneal cavity. In view of the patient's condition
     it was not thought wise to proceed further, and he somewhat
     improved later, and was sent to the Base. Loss of power in the
     right lower extremity pointed to injury to the anterior crural
     nerve.

     On the patient's arrival at Wynberg there were signs of local
     peritonitis in the lower half of the abdomen, and all his urine
     was passed from the wound in the left thigh. Some days later
     this wound was enlarged to allow of the freer exit of pus, and
     a fragment of bone was removed. The wound granulated healthily,
     but the man steadily emaciated and lost ground, with signs of
     chronic septicæmia, and he died on the twenty-first day. At the
     post-mortem examination a transverse wound of the anterior
     wall of the bladder behind the pubes, below the peritoneal
     reflexion, was found gaping somewhat widely, and 2 inches in
     length. There was little sign of previous peritonitis. The
     retained bullet was discovered beneath the femoral vessels in
     the left thigh.

     (196) Extra-peritoneal perforation of the bladder.--Wounded
     at Paardeberg. Entry (Mauser), 3 inches above the left tuber
     ischii; exit, above the symphysis, immediately over the right
     margin of the penis. The patient was retiring to fetch
     ammunition when shot. Urine was noted to escape from both
     apertures the day after, and this continued until he was sent
     down to the Base on the fourteenth day. The patient was then
     considerably emaciated, complained of great pain, especially
     down the left thigh (sciatic nerve), the temperature averaged
     100°, the pulse 80, tongue clean and moist, bowels acted
     regularly, no sign of injury to the rectum. He was taking food
     fairly, but was very sleepless. Urine was passed per urethram,
     and also escaped by both wounds. The abdomen was flaccid and
     sunken, respiratory movements being confined to the upper half.

     As there was evidence of considerable infiltration in the
     buttock, the original entry wound was enlarged, and a catheter
     was tied into the bladder. Little change occurred in the
     symptoms and the local condition, urine and pus continued to
     escape freely from the posterior wound, and the patient
     gradually sank, dying on the thirty-eighth day. At the
     post-mortem examination the peritoneum was found intact and
     unaltered, but there was extensive pelvic cellulitis around the
     bladder, a large slough and some pus lying in the cavum Retzii.
     An aperture of entry still open existed in the centre of the
     anterior wall of the bladder, and a patent exit opening at the
     base of the trigone. The bullet had passed out of the pelvis by
     the great sciatic notch.

The above remarks and cases sufficiently set forth the prognosis in these injuries. For the
intra-peritoneal lesions an expectant plan of treatment may be followed by uncomplicated recovery.
Mention has already been made of a case in which a Mauser bullet was retained in the bladder
and was subsequently passed per urethram. In such a case a cystotomy would be indicated were
the bullet discovered in the viscus.

As to extra-peritoneal injuries it is difficult to lay down guiding lines. I believe the ideal
treatment would be a supra-pubic cystotomy and drainage of the bladder by a Sprengel's pump
apparatus, such as we employ at home. Under these circumstances, with the possibility of keeping
the bladder actually empty, I believe good results might be obtained. Certainly drainage of
the bladder by a catheter tied in proved worse than useless, and I very much doubt whether
a simple supra-pubic opening would give any better results under the circumstances under which
a patient has to be treated in a Field hospital.

Cases might, however, occur in which oblique passage of the bullet cuts a groove and makes
a large opening in the peritoneum-clad portion of the viscus. Under satisfactory conditions
a laparotomy would be here indicated. I take it that this condition would most probably be
accompanied by retention of bloody urine, which fact would arouse suspicion.

INJURIES TO THE SOLID ABDOMINAL VISCERA

Wounds of the kidney.--Tracks implicating the kidneys were of comparatively common occurrence.
As uncomplicated injuries they healed rapidly, and without producing any serious symptoms beyond
transient hæmaturia.

The nature of the lesion appeared to vary with the direction of the wound. In many cases a
simple puncture no doubt alone existed, an injury no more to be feared than the exploratory
punctures often made for surgical purposes. In other cases the wounds may have been of the
nature of notches and grooves.

Two of the cases recounted below were of a more severe variety; in one (No. 201) both kidneys
were implicated by symmetrical wounds of the loin, and in the case of the right organ a transverse
rupture was produced, which was followed by the development of a hydro-nephrosis, and later
by suppuration. This injury was probably the result of a wound from a short range, as the patient
was one of those wounded in the early part of the day at the battle of Magersfontein. It was
complicated by a wound of the spleen and an injury to the spinal cord producing incomplete
paraplegia accompanied by retention of urine. The last complication was responsible for the
death of the patient, since ascending infection from the bladder led to the development of
pyo-nephrosis and death from secondary peritonitis.

Case 202 is an instance of a transverse wound of the upper part of the abdominal cavity; it
is impossible to say what further complications were present. The early development of a tympanitic
abscess suggested an injury to the colon, but this was not by any means certain. The condition
of the kidney was very likely similar to that in the last case, but the ultimate recovery of
the patient left this a matter of doubt. The case was also one dependent on a short-range wound,
since the patient, one of the Scandinavian contingent, was wounded at Magersfontein during
close fighting.

The common history of the symptoms after a wound of the kidney was moderate hæmorrhage from
the organ, persisting for two to four days. In one of the cases recounted below the hæmaturia
was accompanied by the passage of ureteral clots, but this was not a common occurrence.

For the sake of comparison I have included one case of wound of the kidney from a large bullet,
in which death was due to internal hæmorrhage. In this instance the injury was a complex one,
the lung certainly, and the back of the liver probably, being concurrently injured. None the
less if the same track had been produced by a bullet of small calibre I believe the injury
would not have proved a fatal one. I never saw such free renal hæmorrhage in any of the Mauser
or Lee-Metford wounds.

     (197) Wound of right kidney.--Wounded at Modder River while
     lying in the prone position; retired 100 yards at the double
     with his company, and walked a further 1-1/2 mile. There was
     very slight bleeding. Entry (Mauser), in the tenth right
     intercostal space in the mid-axillary line; exit, in eleventh
     interspace, 2 inches from the spinous processes. Cylindrical
     blood-clots, 3 inches in length, were passed on the first two
     occasions of micturition after the accident, and the urine
     contained blood. For four days he could only lie on the wounded
     side. When seen on the third day the urine was normal, and
     there were no signs of injury to either thoracic or abdominal
     viscera. He returned to England well at the end of a month.

     (198) Wound of right kidney.--Wounded at Modder River while
     kneeling to dress another man's wound. Entry (Mauser), in the
     seventh right intercostal space in the nipple line; exit, 1
     inch to the right of the twelfth dorsal spine. The man was
     carried off the field, and during the first day vomited
     frequently. For two days there was blood in his urine, and he
     passed water four to five times daily. He returned to duty at
     the end of three weeks.

     (199) Wound of the left kidney.--Wounded at Magersfontein.
     Entry (Mauser), 2 inches to the left and 1 inch below the
     left nipple. No exit. Lying in prone position when struck.
     Bloody urine was passed at normal intervals for four days, when
     the hæmaturia ceased. No thoracic signs, and no other sign of
     abdominal injury. There was tenderness in the left loin below
     the twelfth rib for some days, possibly over the position of
     the bullet, but the latter was neither localised nor removed.

     (200) Wound of the right kidney.--Wounded at Magersfontein
     while retiring on his feet. Entry (Mauser), immediately to
     the right of the second lumbar spinous process; bullet retained
     and lay beneath margin of ninth right costal cartilage. The man
     passed urine containing blood twelve times during the first
     day, and hæmaturia continued until the evening of the third
     day. On the third day the belly was tumid and did not move
     well; there was no dulness in the right flank. Pulse 120, fair
     strength. Temperature 99°. Respirations 20. Tongue moist,
     bowels confined for four days. The fifth day the pulse fell to
     76, and the bowels were moved by an enema. Great tenderness
     over bullet. The tenderness persisted over the bullet and also
     in the right flank until the tenth day, when the bullet was
     removed. At the end of a month the patient returned to England
     well but during the third week there was occasionally blood in
     the urine.

     (201) Wound of both kidneys (rupture of right) and
     spleen.--Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry (Mauser), (a) 1
     inch to right of second lumbar spinous process; (b) above
     angle of left ninth rib: exits, (a) 1 inch internal to
     right anterior superior iliac spine; (b) in seventh
     intercostal space in mid-axillary line. The wound on the right
     side gave rise to a lesion of the lumbar bulb (see p. 315), and
     the patient suffered throughout with retention. There was
     complete paralysis of the right lower extremity, both motor and
     sensory. For ten days there was hæmaturia, and very severe
     cystitis developed, while the patient suffered with severe
     abdominal pain. The cystitis persisted, also retention, which
     gradually gave way to dribbling, while irregular rise of
     temperature and tenderness in the loins pointed to ascending
     inflammation in the ureters. The patient gradually lost
     ground, and a month later suddenly developed signs of
     peritonitis, severe vomiting, distension, and dulness in the
     right flank; and in two days he died.

     At the post-mortem examination the following condition was
     found:--On the right side general pleural adhesions, recent
     lymph over ascending colon and cæcum, [Symbol: ounce]vj of
     bloody fluid in a localised cavity between colon, kidney,
     stomach, and liver. Lower quarter of right kidney in half its
     width separated from main part of organ, yellow in colour, and
     enveloped in disintegrating clot. Blood-staining of psoas
     sheath; no injury to vertebral column or to bowel detected.

     On the left side recent pleural adhesions and consolidation of
     base of lung, rent of diaphragm; spleen soft and disorganised
     and presenting a yellow cicatrix at its upper end, and at
     antero-external aspect of left kidney was a soft yellow
     puckered spot about the size of a florin, dipping 3/4 of an
     inch into the organ, which was otherwise healthy, beyond
     congestion. The capsules of both kidneys were adherent, but
     there was no sign of suppuration.

     (202) Wound of right kidney. Traumatic
     hydronephrosis.--Wounded at Magersfontein. The patient was in the prone position
     when struck, and lay on the field from 5 A.M. until 6 P.M.
     There was no sickness, and the bowels did not act. When seen on
     the fourth day he was cheerful, but in some pain. The abdominal
     wall moved well, but was rigid; there was some general
     distension, and very marked local distension of the gastric
     area extending across to the right, so that a depressed band
     extended between the upper and lower parts of the belly. There
     was marked local dulness in the right flank, which did not
     shift on movement; the abdomen was elsewhere tympanitic. Tongue
     furred, bowels confined; there has been no sickness, and no
     hæmatemesis. Urine normal, and in good quantity. Temperature
     100°. Pulse 84, good strength.

     On the sixth day the bowels acted, after the administration of
     [Symbol: ounce]j of sulphate of magnesia, and the distension was
     much lessened, although the belly retained its unusual
     appearance. The dulness in the flank was unaltered. Temperature
     100.8°, pulse 92.

     A week later the man was much improved, suffering no pain.
     Temperature ranged from 99 to 100°, and the pulse about 80. The
     abdomen was normal in appearance, except for general prominence
     of the right thorax in the hepatic area.

     During the third week a large tympanitic abscess developed at
     the aperture of exit, and this was opened (Mr. S. W. F.
     Richardson) through the chest, and a large collection of
     foul-smelling pus, but no fæcal matter, evacuated. The patient
     again improved, but a fortnight later a swelling and apparent
     signs of local peritonitis developed in the right inguinal and
     lower umbilical and lumbar regions. An incision made over this,
     however, disclosed a normal peritoneal cavity and was closed.

     At the end of ten weeks the patient was sent to the Base
     hospital; a large firm swelling was then evident, extending
     from the liver to the inguinal region, and nearly to the median
     line. This gradually increased until it filled half the belly;
     it was at first thought to be a retro-peritoneal hæmatoma
     (similar to that described in case 194), but it became quite
     soft and fluctuating, and was then tapped, and [Symbol:
     ounce]50 of blood-stained fluid, which proved to be urine, were
     removed. The urine rapidly reaccumulated, and the cavity was
     then laid freely open. Urine continued to discharge in large
     quantity for two months, the man meanwhile remaining well, and
     passing a somewhat variable daily quantity of urine ([Symbol:
     ounce]xxiv-[Symbol: ounce]lx).

     At the end of six months the wound had healed, and the man was
     serving as an orderly in the hospital.

     (203) Wound of right kidney and lung.--Wounded near
     Paardekraal, while crawling on hands and knees. Entry
     (Martini-Henry, or small bullet making lateral impact), just
     above the right nipple, opening ragged and large, bullet
     retained. There was very severe shock, accompanied by vomiting,
     but no hæmatemesis. Later there was some hæmoptysis. Pulse 120,
     respirations 48.

     Twenty-four hours later the vomiting had ceased; the patient
     had passed a restless night, in spite of an injection of
     morphia. He lay on his right side, pale and collapsed, but
     answered questions and was quite collected. Pulse
     imperceptible, respirations 56; the abdomen moved freely. The
     urine had been passed twice, and was chiefly blood. The patient
     died shortly afterwards, apparently mainly from internal
     hæmorrhage, although restlessness was not a prominent feature.
     As the Column was on the march no autopsy was possible.

The treatment of uncomplicated wounds of the kidney consisted in the ensurance of rest, either
alone, or with the administration of opium if the hæmaturia was severe. The after-treatment
in the event of the development of hydronephrosis is on ordinary lines. Tapping, or incision
followed by extirpation of the injured viscus, if the less severe procedures failed. I never
saw a case where renal hæmorrhage suggested the removal of the kidney as a primary step, and
much doubt whether such a case is likely to be met with, as the result of a wound from a bullet
of small calibre.

Wounds of the liver.--Wounds of the liver were, I believe, responsible for more cases of death
from primary hæmorrhage than those of the kidney. I heard of a few cases in which this occurred,
although I never saw one. Case 204 is of considerable interest as illustrating the result of
an injury to one of the large bile ducts. Putting the deaths from primary hæmorrhage on one
side, the prognosis in hepatic wounds was as good as in those of the kidneys. A few fairly
uncomplicated cases are quoted below, but wounds of the liver occurred in connection with a
large number of other injuries both of the chest and abdomen, and except in the case of wound
of the stomach, recorded on page 425, No. 164, and in case 188, I never saw any troublesome
consequences ensue.

Nature of the lesions.--I never saw any case of so-called explosive lesion of the liver, such
as have been described from experimental results; this may have been due to the fact that such
patients rapidly expired, but such were never admitted into the hospitals.

The most favourable cases were those in which a simple perforation was effected; such were
usually attended by a practical absence of symptoms, unless a large bile duct had been implicated,
when a temporary biliary fistula resulted.

Biliary fistulæ were, however, much more common when the bullet scored the surface of the organ.
One such case is recounted under the heading of injuries to the stomach, No. 164. Here a deep
gaping cleft with coarsely granular margins extended the whole antero-posterior length of the
under surface of the left lobe, and the escape of bile was free. This was the nearest approach
to one of the so-called explosive injuries I met with.

Case 207 is an example of a superficial injury from a bullet possibly of small calibre in which
a superficial groove was followed by temporary escape of bile, and it is of interest to note
a very similar condition in a shell injury (No. 210) recorded on p. 477.

Although both these cases recovered, I think notching and superficial grooving must be considered
much more serious injuries than pure perforation. (See case 188, p. 442.)

The symptoms observed in these injuries have been already indicated in the above description
of the nature of the lesions. They consisted in the pure perforations of practically nothing,
in the grooves or the perforations implicating a large duct in the escape of bile. In two of
the cases in which a biliary fistula was present transient jaundice was noticed.

In many cases the accompanying wound of the diaphragm gave rise to much discomfort; again,
in the transverse wounds the action of the heart was often affected by the local cardiac shock
accompanying the injury. In one case in which the colon was at the same time wounded (No. 188),
an abscess formed at the site of the hepatic wound, as might have been expected.

As uncomplicated injuries, these wounds were little to be feared. Except as a source of hæmorrhage
in rapidly dying patients, I never heard of a fatality. As a complication of other injuries,
however, the wound of the liver, as has been shown, was sometimes of importance. It was remarkable
in case 204 how little trouble the biliary fistula gave rise to, although the bile was discharged
across the pleural cavity.

The treatment consisted in rest, and morphia in the cases of suspected progressive hæmorrhage,
or in the presence of great pain. In cases where bile was escaping, it was important to ensure
a free vent for the secretion.

     (204) Wound of liver. Biliary fistula.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein. Entry (Lee-Metford), below the seventh rib, in
     the left nipple line; exit, through the eighth rib, in the
     mid axillary line on the right side. The patient lay for
     seventeen hours on the field, during which time the bowels
     acted once, but there was no sickness. The bowels then remained
     confined. When seen on the third day the abdomen was normal and
     the chest resonant throughout on both sides; bile to the amount
     of some ounces escaped from the wound on the right side.
     Suffering no pain; temperature 99°, pulse 100. The bowels acted
     freely the following day.

     During the next fortnight there was little change; [Symbol:
     ounce]ii-iij of bile escaped daily, and there was occasional
     diarrhoea. At the end of that time, however, the temperature
     rose; there was local redness and evidence of retention of pus.
     The wound was therefore enlarged, some fragments of rib removed,
     and a drainage tube inserted. After this the temperature fell,
     and for the next two months the patient suffered little except
     from the discharge from the sinus; this persisted for three
     months, becoming less in amount and less bile-stained, the
     fistula eventually closing in the fourteenth week, when the
     patient was sent home on parole.

     (205) Wound of liver.--Entry (Mauser), 1 inch below and to
     the left of the ensiform cartilage; exit, in the sixth right
     intercostal space, just behind the posterior axillary line. The
     trooper was sitting bolt upright on his horse at the time; both
     were shot and fell together. 'Stitch' on coughing or laughing
     was the only sign noted after the accident; this rapidly
     subsided.

     (206) Wound of the liver.--Wounded at Magersfontein. Entry
     (Mauser), through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch
     from the base of the ensiform cartilage; exit, below the
     twelfth rib 2 inches to the right of the lumbar spines. The
     patient lay on the field some hours and was brought in at night
     very cold, and suffering with much shock. No signs of abdominal
     injury developed, but the pulse remained as slow as 66 for some
     days, and there was some pain and stiffness about back and
     sides, or on taking a deep breath. These signs persisted some
     days, but no others developed, and in six weeks the patient
     returned to duty.

     Some three months later this patient suffered from a short
     severe attack suggesting local peritonitis, but he again
     returned to duty.

     (207) Wound of the liver.--Wounded at Tweefontein. Entry,
     in eighth intercostal space in right mid axillary line; exit,
     1-1/2 inch below the point of the ensiform cartilage, 1/2 an
     inch to the right of the mid line. The wounds were large, and
     although the impact had been oblique, they were possibly
     produced by a Martini-Henry or Guedes bullet.

     On the second day bile began to escape from the exit aperture,
     and this together with a little pus continued to be discharged
     for a week, when the wound rapidly healed up. The only symptom
     which occasioned any trouble was a stitch on inspiration,
     probably attributable to the wound of the diaphragm. There was
     no fracture of the rib.

     (208) Wound of the liver.--Wounded outside Heilbron at a
     range of fifty yards. Entry (Mauser), in the tenth right
     interspace 2 inches to the right of the dorsal spines; exit,
     through the gladiolus, immediately to the right of the median
     line, and just above the junction with the ensiform cartilage.
     There was considerable shock on reception of the injury, and a
     great feeling of dizziness. Continuous vomiting set in and
     persisted for the first two days, then became occasional, and
     ceased only at the end of a week. There was also occasional
     hiccough, and stitch on drawing a long breath. The respiration
     was shallow and rapid. The bowels acted twice shortly after the
     injury.

     The pulse was rapid and small, and a week after the injury was
     still above 100. The abdomen was then normal and moving
     symmetrically, and the respiration fairly easy. There were no
     signs of chest trouble, but some mucous expectoration. A slight
     icteric tinge existed. The patient made a good recovery.

Wounds of the spleen.--Uncomplicated wounds of the spleen were necessarily rare, and beyond
this the strict localisation of a track to the spleen is not a matter of great ease. None the
less the spleen must have been implicated in a considerable number of the wounds crossing the
chest and abdomen. I know of only one case in which a wound which crossed the splenic area
caused death from hæmorrhage, and of this I can give no details, as I never saw the patient.
In this instance, however, a wound of the spleen was diagnosed after death from the position
of the wounds. The patient continued to perform his duty as an officer in the fighting line
for at least an hour after being struck, and then died rapidly apparently from an internal
hæmorrhage.

In case No. 201, included amongst the renal injuries, a wound of the spleen existed, but had
given rise to no symptoms, and at the time of death, some three weeks later, was cicatrised.
The only other assertion of importance that I can make is, that, as far as I could judge, wounds
of the spleen from bullets of small calibre were not, as a rule, accompanied by hæmorrhage,
since I never saw a case in which dulness in the left flank suggested the presence of extravasated
blood, and in no case that I saw was there any history of general symptoms pointing to the
loss of blood.

This is only to be explained by our similar experience with regard to wounds of the liver unaccompanied
by puncture of main vessels, and perhaps hæmorrhage is still less to be expected in the case
of the spleen, in consequence of the contractile muscular tunic with which the organ is provided.

I can quote no case of certain injury to the spleen, except that already referred to discovered
at a post-mortem examination, but many wounds were observed in positions of which the following
may be taken as a type. Entry, through the seventh left costal cartilage, 3/4 of an inch from
the sternal margin; exit, 2-1/2 inches from the left lumbar spines at the level of the last rib.

As an instance of the doctrine of chances I might quote the position of the wound in the patient
who lay in the next bed. Both patients were wounded while fighting at Almonds Nek.

In neither of these cases did anything except the position of the external apertures point
to the infliction of visceral injury.

General remarks as to the prognosis in abdominal injuries. The prognosis in each form of individual
visceral injury has been already considered, but a few points affecting these injuries as a
class should perhaps be further considered.

First, as to the influence of range on the severity of the injuries inflicted; I am not able
to confirm the greater danger of short range, except in so far as there is no doubt that more
shock attends such injuries, and possibly some of the most severely wounded were killed outright
as a direct consequence of the greater striking force of the bullet.

Among the cases in which but slight effects were noted, however, many were said to have been
hit within a range of 200 yards, as for instance the two injuries quoted under the heading
of wounds of the spleen.

I personally saw no cases in which explosive injuries of the solid viscera were to be ascribed
to this cause.

Secondly, as to the immediate prognosis in all abdominal injuries, the ensurance of rest and
limitation as far as possible of transport were of the highest importance, either in the case
of wound of the alimentary canal, or in wounds of the solid viscera in which hæmorrhage was
a possible result.

Thirdly, as to the later prognosis in these injuries; very few men are fit to resume active
service without a prolonged period of rest. In spite of the insignificance of the primary symptoms,
or of the favourable course taken by the injuries, active exertion was almost always followed
for some months by the appearance of vague pains and occasionally by indications of recurrent
peritoneal symptoms, pointing to the disturbance of quiescent hæmorrhages, or of adhesions.
Wounds of the kidney are apparently those least liable to be followed by trouble.

Lastly, the prognosis was influenced in the case of many of the viscera by coexisting injury
to other organs or parts.

For instance, at least thirty per cent. of the abdominal wounds were complicated by wound of
the thorax; and in the lower segment of the abdomen injury to the extra-peritoneal portions
of the pelvic organs was common.

Both the immediate and ultimate prognosis were influenced greatly by this fact.

As to the individual injuries:

1. Wounds in the intestinal area, except in certain directions, often traverse the abdomen
without inflicting a perforating injury on the bowel.

2. If the alimentary canal is perforated, injuries in certain segments, even if perforating,
may be followed by spontaneous recovery. I should say the prognosis from this point of view
is best in the ascending colon, then in the rectum; after these most favourable segments, I
should place the others in the following order: stomach, sigmoid flexure, descending colon.
As to perforating wounds of the transverse colon and small intestine, I believe spontaneous
recovery to be very rare.

3. Wounds of the solid viscera generally, usually heal spontaneously, and give no trouble unless
one of the great vessels has been injured. I include in this category all organs except the
pancreas, of wounds of which I had no experience.

4. Wounds of the bladder, if of the nature of pure perforations in the intra-peritoneal segment,
often heal spontaneously.

5. As a rule, injuries to the organs in their intra-peritoneal course have a far better prognosis
than those which implicate the organs in their uncovered portions.

6. The small calibre of the bullet is alone responsible for the favourable results observed.

7. The danger or otherwise of an intestinal injury depends mainly on mechanical conditions;
for instance, the fixity of the ascending colon, and its comparative freedom from a covering
of small intestine capable by movement of diffusing any infective material, account chiefly
for such favourable results as are seen when that segment of the bowel is implicated.

WOUNDS OF THE EXTERNAL GENITAL ORGANS

Wounds of the scrotum were not uncommon, especially in connection with perforations of the
upper part of the thigh. They offered no special feature, beyond the common tendency of every-day
experience to the development of extensive ecchymosis.

Wounds of the testicles I saw on several occasions. I remember only one out of some half-dozen
in which castration became necessary. I was told of one case, for the accuracy of which I cannot
vouch, in which destruction of one testicle was followed by an attack of melancholia, culminating
in the suicide of the patient.

Wounds of the penis also occurred, but as a rule were unimportant. I append a case, however;
in which the penile urethra was wounded, which is of some interest.

     (209) Wounded at Heilbron. Range 1,500 yards. Entry, 2-1/2
     inches below the right anterior superior iliac spine; the
     bullet traversed the groin superficially in the line of
     Poupart's ligament, emerged, and crossed both penis and
     scrotum. The trooper was in the saddle when struck, and the
     penis probably somewhat coiled up. Three wounds were found, one
     at the junction of the penis and scrotum which opened the
     urethra, a second one about 3/4 of an inch along the under
     surface of the penis, and a third on the left side of the base
     of the prepuce. A considerable amount of oedema and
     ecchymosis of the scrotum developed, but no extravasation of
     urine. A catheter was kept in the urethra for some days, and
     the opening eventually closed by granulation.

I only once saw a patient with an injury to the deep urethra; in this case concurrent injury
to other pelvic organs led to death on the third day. As a good many of the patients with pelvic
wounds died rapidly, the accident may have been more common than my experience would suggest.

CHAPTER XII

ON SHELL WOUNDS

The title of this work hardly allows of its conclusion without a brief mention of the shell
wounds observed during the campaign.

As already pointed out, these formed but a very small proportion of the injuries treated in
the hospitals, and beyond this they possessed comparatively small surgical interest, since,
as a rule, the features presented were those of mere lacerated wounds, while the more severe
of the cases which survived only offered scope for operations of the mutilating class so uncongenial
to modern surgical instincts.

The fatal wounds consisted in extensive lacerations resulting in the destruction of the head
or limbs, the laying open of the abdominal or thoracic cavities, or the production of visceral
injuries beyond the possibility of repair. Of such injuries no further mention will be made.

A very great variety of shells was employed during the campaign, especially on the part of
the Boers, and the frontispiece gives some idea of these. The photograph was taken by Mr. Kisch
after the relief of Ladysmith. For the want of more extended knowledge I shall confine myself
to the description of a few injuries caused by two classes of large shell, those of the Vickers-Maxim
or 'Pom-pom,' and two varieties of shrapnel.

The large shells employed may be divided into classes according to the metal used in their
construction, and the nature of the explosive with which they were filled. These details are
of some surgical import, because they affect the nature of the fragments into which the shells
are broken up.

Fragments of shells constructed with cast iron and burst with powder, and also of forged steel
exploded with lyddite, are depicted in fig. 90.

Examination of fragment C of a cast-iron shell exploded by powder shows the characteristic
granular fracture, and edges, although sharp, yet of a comparatively rounded nature. The fragment
is also heavier for its surface measurement, as the metal is thicker than that seen in the
remaining fragments, although the cast-iron shell was of a much smaller calibre than the steel
one. The lesser degree of penetrative power, and increased capacity to contuse, possessed by
such fragments are obvious.

A B and D are fragments of a large forged steel howitzer shell exploded by lyddite, such as
were cast by our guns. The photograph well shows the more tenacious structure of the metal
in the incomplete longitudinal fissuring exhibited, while the margins are of a sharp knifelike
character, well calculated to penetrate or, in the case of superficial injuries, to produce
wounds of a more sharply incised character than the cast-iron shell. Fragments A and B also
show an appearance suggestive of partial fusion, characteristic of high explosive action, in
the turning of the prominent margins.

The larger fragments of such shells were responsible for the most serious mutilating injuries,
while small fragments sometimes caused comparatively simple perforating wounds. I remember
a fragment of the fused character not larger than a small nut which had perforated the front
of the thigh of a Boer, and lodged near the inner surface of the femur. Removal of the fragment
was followed by a free gush of hæmorrhage. When the wound was opened up an opening was found
in the external circumflex artery, hæmorrhage from which had been controlled by the impaction
of the piece of shell. As an example of the cutting power of sharp fragments of shell I might
instance the case of another Boer in whom light passing contact had been made by the missile.
A gaping incised wound extended from above the angle of the scapula down to the outer surface
of the buttock. The wound involved the latissimus dorsi, and the external and internal oblique
muscles of the abdomen. The separate muscular layers were sharply defined in the lateral parts
of the floor of the wound, and remained so for some time during the gradual contraction of
the large granulating surface produced. The degree of contusion was in fact slight, while the
incised character was strongly marked.

In some cases the fragments merely struck the soldiers on the flat without producing any wound.
In one such case a blow upon the epigastrium was, according to the patient, followed by the
vomiting of a considerable amount of blood. A fluid diet was ordered, and no further ill effects
were noted. The following case illustrates an oblique blow of a perforating character, which
was nevertheless recovered from.

     (210) Shell-wound of abdomen. Injury to liver.--Wounded at
     Paardeberg by a fragment of shell. Aperture of entry, a ragged
     opening in the median line. The fragment of shell was retained
     over the ninth costal cartilage in the nipple line. The wound
     bled freely, but the man was taken into camp, and then four
     miles on to the hospital, where he was anæsthetised and the
     fragment extracted. The wound of entry was at the same time
     enlarged, cleansed, and partly sutured. The patient vomited
     once after the anæsthetic, and the bowels remained confined for
     three or four days after the injury. The extraction wound
     healed readily, but a considerable amount of slimy,
     bile-stained discharge was still escaping from the ragged
     entrance wound on the man's arrival at the Base on the
     fourteenth day. The abdomen was then normal in appearance, and
     as to physical signs, except for a tympanitic note over the
     hepatic area to the right of the wound. The temperature was
     normal, the pulse 90, the tongue clean, and the bowels were
     acting. At the end of four weeks pleurisy, with effusion,
     developed on the right side; the chest was aspirated and
     [Symbol: ounce]xx of clear serum drawn off. The man then
     rapidly improved; the bile-stained discharge ceased at the end
     of five weeks, and a small granulating wound eventually closed
     at the end of two months, when the man returned to England.

Fig. 91 is inserted to illustrate the multifarious nature of the fragments into which the component
parts of shells may break up. The pieces are for the most part of brass, and formed parts of
either time or percussion fuses.

Fig. 92 represents the one-pound Vickers-Maxim shell in its actual size. The wounds produced
by this shell are of some interest, since the Vickers-Maxim may be said to have been on trial
during this campaign. The general opinion seems to have been to the effect that the moral influence
produced by the continuous rapid firing of the gun and the attendant unpleasant noise were
its chief virtues. A considerable number of wounds must, however, have been produced by it,
which, if not of great magnitude and severity, were, at any rate, calculated to put the recipients
out of action, and these wounds, moreover, were slower in healing than many of the rifle-bullet
injuries.

The shell is so small that it was said to occasionally strike the body as a whole, and perforate.
I was shown a case in which a wounded officer was confident that an entire shell had perforated
his arm. The entry wound was at the outer part of the front of the forearm, the exit at the
inner aspect of the arm, just above the elbow. Two ragged contused wounds existed, which healed
slowly, but no serious nervous or vascular injury had been produced. Although it is probable
that only a fragment perforated in this case, it is of interest in connection with the following.

In a case shown to me by Sir William Thomson in the Irish Hospital at Bloemfontein, an entire
shell had passed between the left arm and body of a trooper, perforating the haversack, as
also a non-commissioned officer's notebook contained within it, without exploding. The only
injury sustained by the trooper was a contusion on the inner aspect of the elbow-joint, with
slight signs of contusion of the ulnar nerve. The case is of some importance, as showing that
a comparatively resistent body can be perforated without necessary explosion on the part of
the shell; hence the possibility of a similar perforation of the soft parts of the body.

Fig. 93 is of a number of fragments of Vickers-Maxim shells, and it was by such that the great
majority of the wounds were produced.

Wounds from fragments of these shells were, indeed, not at all rare. They were met with on
any position; but, as far as my experience went, they were more common on the lower extremities
than in other parts of the body, if the sufferers were in the erect position when wounded.
I saw a good many wounds in the neighbourhood of the knee, some of which implicated the joint.
When the injuries were received by patients in the lying or crouching positions, any part of
the body was equally likely to be affected, or, again, the presence of large stones or rocks
in the vicinity might determine the scattering of the flying fragments at a more dangerous
height than when the shells burst from contact with the actual ground.

The relation of one or two examples of wounds from pom-pom fragments may not be without interest,
the more so as they illustrate the favourable influence of a low degree of velocity on the
part of a projectile. I saw three wounds produced by the percussion fuses of these shells,
an experience which shows that they were not very uncommon.

     (211) Perforating shell-wound of abdomen.--Wounded at
     Magersfontein by the fuse screw of a small shell
     (Vickers-Maxim). Aperture of entry ragged, roughly circular,
     and 2 inches in diameter, with much-contused margins situated
     in the median line, nearly midway between the ensiform
     cartilage and umbilicus. The screw was lodged in the abdominal
     wall at the margin of the thorax, just outside the left nipple
     line. The aperture of entry was cleansed by Major Harris,
     R.A.M.C., who determined the fact that penetration of the
     peritoneal cavity had occurred, and removed the fuse (see fig.
     94) by a separate incision. The patient made an uneventful and
     uninterrupted recovery, the wound healing by granulation and
     leaving little weakness of the abdominal wall. He returned to
     England at the end of five weeks.

In a second case the fuse, together with a fragment of the iron case, entered the buttock by
a ragged opening. The fragment of iron escaped by an exit aperture of about the same size.
When the patient arrived at the Base some days after the injury, a hard body was felt in the
wound, and on exploration the fuse was found and removed.

In a third case the fuse struck the side of the foot below the outer malleolus and comminuted
the astragalus, and then passing forwards lodged beneath the extensor tendons of the toes.
The wound was explored at the time of the injury and some fragments of bone removed; considerable
cellulitis supervened, and the fuse was only discovered some days later when the patient came
under the care of Sir W. Thomson in the Irish Hospital in Pretoria. It was there removed, together
with some more fragments of bone, and the wound slowly granulated. The patient then returned
to England, when the wound rapidly healed after the removal of some further necrosed fragments
of cancellous tissue. The astragalus had been reduced to a mere shell of compact tissue, and
the convexity of the articular surface was altogether lost. The deformity, together with the
formation of adhesions in the ankle-joint, led to the development of a firm anchylosis.

My friend Mr. Abbott removed a similar fuse from the substance of the lung after the lapse
of nine months, the patient having developed an empyema, and a chronic fistula, which rapidly
closed after the removal of the foreign body.

I will add one further case, that illustrated by plate XXV. In this a fragment of a pom-pom
shell entered the outer aspect of the right shoulder to escape on the inner aspect of the arm,
just below the confines of the axilla. An oblique, non-comminuted fracture of the humerus resulted,
which in spite of moderate suppuration united well in the course of six weeks. The case is
of particular interest as illustrating the nature of the fracture to be expected when the velocity
retained by the missile is low.

The above instances show that such peculiarities as belong to wounds produced by pom-pom shells
depend on the comparatively small size and weight of the fragments, and on the small degree
of impetus with which they are propelled.

Fig. 95 illustrates a form of shrapnel employed by the Boers, the case of which is of cast
metal arranged in definite segments, while the interior is filled with small fragments of iron
so shaped as to pack in concentric layers. As to the wounds produced by the contained fragments
I have no experience, since I never saw one of the pieces of iron removed. This no doubt depended
in part on the very unsatisfactory practice made by the Boers with shrapnel generally. Even
when they fired English shrapnel, the shells were, as a rule, exploded far too high to cause
any serious danger to the men beneath. I saw on one occasion a large number of shrapnel shells
exploded over a body of Imperial Yeomanry, but as a result of the great height at which all
the shells were exploded, not a single casualty resulted.

The segment casing of the shell, however, I several times saw removed from the body. The fragment
shown in fig. 95 was removed from the buttock of a man after one of Lord Methuen's early battles.
It may be remarked that the buttock is rather a common, and also a favourable, seat for shell
wounds with retention of the fragment. This no doubt depends on the fact that the buttock is
one of the few superficial regions in which sufficient depth of tissue exists for the retention
or the passage of so large an object as a fragment of shell.

Fig. 96 is of a number of leaden shrapnel bullets from our own shells. A normal undeformed
bullet, such as was the usual cause of wounds, is shown at the left-hand upper corner. The
remainder show common forms of deformity caused by striking on the ground or against rocks.
I attribute small importance to the deformed bullets, as I never saw one removed, and it is
probable that a ricochet shrapnel bullet would rarely retain sufficient force to penetrate.
The lower fragments are inserted to illustrate a fact that would scarcely have been assumed,
that these bullets on impact occasionally suffer a fracture of a somewhat crystalline nature.
The occurrence of this gross form of fracture is of some interest in relation to the extreme
fragmentation sometimes undergone by the hardened leaden cores of the small-calibre bullets.

A considerable number of wounds from leaden shrapnel bullets were met with among our own men,
as well as among the Boers. The wounds possessed little special interest, except from the fact
that the bullets were often retained. I saw bullets in the chest on several occasions, also
in the abdomen, pelvis, the neighbourhood of joints, and in the limbs.

I saw one patient who had suffered no less than six perforating wounds as the result of the
bursting of one shrapnel shell.

I will here quote one case of interest as completing the various forms of perforating wound
of the abdomen met with during the campaign.

     (212) Perforating shrapnel-wound of abdomen.--Boer wounded at
     Graspan. Aperture of entry (shrapnel), opposite eighth left
     costal cartilage, 1 inch external to nipple line. The opening
     was circular, and surrounded by an area of ecchymosis 4 inches
     in diameter; exit, 4-1/2 inches above and to the right of the
     umbilicus. Patient was at first in a Boer ambulance, and only
     seen by me on the ninth day. At that date he was dressed and
     walking with a gauze pad and bandage over the wounds. From the
     exit wound, which was 1 inch in diameter, protruded a piece of
     sloughing omentum, the margin of the wound being everted and
     raised over a circular indurated area.

     It was thought best to allow the sloughing omentum, which was
     very foul, to separate spontaneously, and then to return the
     stump. At the end of three weeks, however, the slough had not
     only separated, but the stump had retracted, and only a small
     granulating surface was left, which healed spontaneously.

I have little to say regarding the treatment of shell wounds. The mutilating injuries, if not
of a fatal character, necessitated treatment of a corresponding nature to the damage. In all
such cases the general rules of surgery indicate the lines to be followed.

In the case of shrapnel wounds the bullets were often better removed; but when in dangerous
positions, as sunk deeply in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, they were best left, unless some
very special indication for removal existed. Large fragments of shell always demanded removal.

In conclusion I will only make the further remark, that shell wounds, with the exception of
clean leaden shrapnel tracks, always suppurated.

I make this closing statement with the view of emphasising the influence exerted on the aseptic
course of modern rifle wounds by the small calibre of the bullet, since both bullet and shell
wounds were exposed to the same surrounding conditions.
