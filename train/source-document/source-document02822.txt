216. FROM ROME TO GAUL is, considering the means of modern locomotion, no great way; but the
ancient sumptuary laws of that kingdom give us little information regarding the ichthyophagous
propensities of its inhabitants. Louis XII. engaged six fishmongers to furnish his board with
fresh-water animals, and Francis I. had twenty-two, whilst Henry the Great extended his requirements
a little further, and had twenty-four. In the time of Louis XIV. the cooks had attained to
such a degree of perfection in their art, that they could convert the form and flesh of the
trout, pike, or carp, into the very shape and flavour of the most delicious game.

    The French long enjoyed a European reputation for their skill
    and refinement in the preparing of food. In place of plain
    joints, French cookery delights in the marvels of what are
    called made dishes, ragouts, stews, and fricassees, in which no
    trace of the original materials of which they are compounded is
    to be found.

217. FROM GAUL WE CROSS TO BRITAIN, where it has been asserted, by, at least, one authority,
that the ancient inhabitants ate no fish. However this may be, we know that the British shores,
particularly those of the North Sea, have always been well supplied with the best kinds of
fish, which we may reasonably infer was not unknown to the inhabitants, or likely to be lost
upon them for the lack of knowledge as to how they tasted. By the time of Edward II., fish
had, in England, become a dainty, especially the sturgeon, which was permitted to appear on
no table but that of the king. In the fourteenth century, a decree of King John informs us
that the people ate both seals and porpoises; whilst in the days of the Troubadours, whales
were fished for and caught in the Mediterranean Sea, for the purpose of being used as human food.

    Whatever checks the ancient British may have had upon their
    piscatory appetites, there are happily none of any great
    consequence upon the modern, who delight in wholesome food of
    every kind. Their taste is, perhaps, too much inclined to that
    which is accounted solid and substantial; but they really eat
    more moderately, even of animal food, than either the French or
    the Germans. Roast beef, or other viands cooked in the plainest
    manner, are, with them, a sufficient luxury; yet they delight in
    living well, whilst it is easy to prove how largely their
    affections are developed by even the prospect of a substantial
    cheer. In proof of this we will just observe, that if a great
    dinner is to be celebrated, it is not uncommon for the appointed
    stewards and committee to meet and have a preliminary dinner
    among themselves, in order to arrange the great one, and after
    that, to have another dinner to discharge the bill which the
    great one cost. This enjoyable disposition we take to form a
    very large item in the aggregate happiness of the nation.

218. THE GENERAL USE OF FISH, as an article of human food among civilized nations, we have
thus sufficiently shown, and will conclude this portion of our subject with the following hints,
which ought to be remembered by all those who are fond of occasionally varying their dietary
with a piscine dish:--

I. Fish shortly before they spawn are, in general, best in condition. When the spawning is
just over, they are out of season, and unfit for human food.

II. When fish is out of season, it has a transparent, bluish tinge, however much it may be
boiled; when it is in season, its muscles are firm, and boil white and curdy.

III. As food for invalids, white fish, such as the ling, cod, haddock, coal-fish, and whiting,
are the best; flat fish, as soles, skate, turbot, and flounders, are also good.

IV. Salmon, mackerel, herrings, and trout soon spoil or decompose after they are killed; therefore,
to be in perfection, they should be prepared for the table on the day they are caught. With
flat fish, this is not of such consequence, as they will keep longer. The turbot, for example,
is improved by being kept a day or two.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR DRESSING FISH.

219. IN DRESSING FISH, of any kind, the first point to be attended to, is to see that it be
perfectly clean. It is a common error to wash it too much; as by doing so the flavour is diminished.
If the fish is to be boiled, a little salt and vinegar should be put into the water, to give
it firmness, after it is cleaned. Cod-fish, whiting, and haddock, are far better if a little
salted, and kept a day; and if the weather be not very hot, they will be good for two days.

220. WHEN FISH IS CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL, and a larger quantity is purchased than is immediately
wanted, the overplus of such as will bear it should be potted, or pickled, or salted, and hung
up; or it may be fried, that it may serve for stewing the next day. Fresh-water fish, having
frequently a muddy smell and taste, should be soaked in strong salt and water, after it has
been well cleaned. If of a sufficient size, it may be scalded in salt and water, and afterwards
dried and dressed.

221. FISH SHOULD BE PUT INTO COLD WATER, and set on the fire to do very gently, or the outside
will break before the inner part is done. Unless the fishes are small, they should never be
put into warm water; nor should water, either hot or cold, be poured on to the fish, as it
is liable to break the skin: if it should be necessary to add a little water whilst the fish
is cooking, it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the vessel. The fish-plate may be
drawn up, to see if the fish be ready, which may be known by its easily separating from the
bone. It should then be immediately taken out of the water, or it will become woolly. The fish-plate
should be set crossways over the kettle, to keep hot for serving, and a clean cloth over the
fish, to prevent its losing its colour.

222. IN GARNISHING FISH, great attention is required, and plenty of parsley, horseradish, and
lemon should be used. If fried parsley be used, it must be washed and picked, and thrown into
fresh water. When the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it immediately from the
water, and instantly it will be green and crisp, and must be taken up with a slice. When well
done, and with very good sauce, fish is more appreciated than almost any other dish. The liver
and roe, in some instances, should be placed on the dish, in order that they may be distributed
in the course of serving; but to each recipe will be appended the proper mode of serving and
garnishing.

223. IF FISH IS TO BE FRIED OR BROILED, it must be dried in a nice soft cloth, after it is
well cleaned and washed. If for frying, brush it over with egg, and sprinkle it with some fine
crumbs of bread. If done a second time with the egg and bread, the fish will look so much the
better. If required to be very nice, a sheet of white blotting-paper must be placed to receive
it, that it may be free from all grease. It must also be of a beautiful colour, and all the
crumbs appear distinct. Butter gives a bad colour; lard and clarified dripping are most frequently
used; but oil is the best, if the expense be no objection. The fish should be put into the
lard when boiling, and there should be a sufficiency of this to cover it.

224. WHEN FISH IS BROILED, it must be seasoned, floured, and laid on a very clean gridiron,
which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of suet, to prevent the fish from sticking. It
must be broiled over a very clear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that
it may not be scorched.

225. IN CHOOSING FISH, it is well to remember that it is possible it may be fresh, and yet
not good. Under the head of each particular fish in this work, are appended rules for its choice
and the months when it is in season. Nothing can be of greater consequence to a cook than to
have the fish good; as if this important course in a dinner does not give satisfaction, it
is rarely that the repast goes off well.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER VIII.

FISH.

[Nothing is more difficult than to give the average prices of Fish, inasmuch as a few hours
of bad weather at sea will, in the space of one day, cause such a difference in its supply,
that the same fish--a turbot for instance--which may be bought to-day for six or seven shillings,
will, to-morrow, be, in the London markets, worth, perhaps, almost as many pounds. The average
costs, therefore, which will be found appended to each recipe, must be understood as about
the average price for the different kinds of fish, when the market is supplied upon an average,
and when the various sorts are of an average size and quality.

GENERAL RULE IN CHOOSING FISH.--A proof of freshness and goodness in most fishes, is their
being covered with scales; for, if deficient in this respect, it is a sign of their being stale,
or having been ill-used.]

FRIED ANCHOVIES.

226. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of oil, 1/2 a glass of white wine, sufficient flour to thicken;
12 anchovies.

Mode.--Mix the oil and wine together, with sufficient flour to make them into a thickish paste;
cleanse the anchovies, wipe them, dip them in the paste, and fry of a nice brown colour.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost for this quantity, 9d.

Seasonable all the year.

Sufficient for 2 persons.

    THE ANCHOVY.--In his book of "British Fishes," Mr. Yarrell
    states that "the anchovy is a common fish in the Mediterranean,
    from Greece to Gibraltar, and was well known to the Greeks and
    Romans, by whom the liquor prepared from it, called garum, was
    in great estimation. Its extreme range is extended into the
    Black Sea. The fishing for them is carried on during the night,
    and lights are used with the nets. The anchovy is common on the
    coasts of Portugal, Spain, and France. It occurs, I have no
    doubt, at the Channel Islands, and has been taken on the
    Hampshire coast, and in the Bristol Channel." Other fish, of
    inferior quality, but resembling the real Gorgona anchovy, are
    frequently sold for it, and passed off as genuine.

ANCHOVY BUTTER OR PASTE.

227. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen anchovies, 1/2 lb. of fresh butter.

Mode.--Wash the anchovies thoroughly; bone and dry them, and pound them in a mortar to a paste.
Mix the butter gradually with them, and rub the whole through a sieve. Put it by in small pots
for use, and carefully exclude the air with a bladder, as it soon changes the colour of anchovies,
besides spoiling them.

Average cost for this quantity, 2s.

POTTED ANCHOVIES.

POTTED ANCHOVIES are made in the same way, by adding pounded mace, cayenne, and nutmeg to taste.

ANCHOVY TOAST.

228. INGREDIENTS.--Toast 2 or 3 slices of bread, or, if wanted very savoury, fry them in clarified
butter, and spread on them the paste, No. 227. Made mustard, or a few grains of cayenne, may
be added to the paste before laying it on the toast.

    ANCHOVY PASTE.--"When some delicate zest," says a work just
    issued on the adulterations of trade, "is required to make the
    plain English breakfast more palatable, many people are in the
    habit of indulging in what they imagine to be anchovies. These
    fish are preserved in a kind of pickling-bottle, carefully
    corked down, and surrounded by a red-looking liquor, resembling
    in appearance diluted clay. The price is moderate, one shilling
    only being demanded for the luxury. When these anchovies are
    what is termed potted, it implies that the fish have been
    pounded into the consistency of a paste, and then placed in flat
    pots, somewhat similar in shape to those used for pomatum. This
    paste is usually eaten spread upon toast, and is said to form an
    excellent bonne bouche, which enables gentlemen at
    wine-parties to enjoy their port with redoubled gusto.
    Unfortunately, in six cases out of ten, the only portion of
    these preserved delicacies, that contains anything indicative of
    anchovies, is the paper label pasted on the bottle or pot, on
    which the word itself is printed.... All the samples of anchovy
    paste, analyzed by different medical men, have been found to be
    highly and vividly coloured with very large quantities of bole
    Armenian." The anchovy itself, when imported, is of a dark dead
    colour, and it is to make it a bright "handsome-looking sauce"
    that this red earth is used.

BARBEL.

229. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of port wine, a saltspoonful of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
2 sliced onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, nutmeg and mace to taste, the juice of a lemon, 2
anchovies; 1 or 2 barbels, according to size.

Mode--Boil the barbels in salt and water till done; pour off some of the water, and, to the
remainder, put the ingredients mentioned above. Simmer gently for 1/2 hour, or rather more,
and strain. Put in the fish; heat it gradually; but do not let it boil, or it will be broken.

Time.--Altogether 1 hour. Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable from September to November.

    THE BARBEL,--This fish takes its name from the barbs or wattels
    at its mouth; and, in England, is esteemed as one of the worst
    of the fresh-water fish. It was, however, formerly, if not now,
    a favourite with the Jews, excellent cookers of fish. Others
    would boil with it a piece of bacon, that it might have a
    relish. It is to be met with from two to three or four feet
    long, and is said to live to a great age. From Putney upwards,
    in the Thames, some are found of large size; but they are valued
    only as affording sport to the brethren of the angle.

BRILL.

230. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water; a little vinegar.

Mode.--Clean the brill, cut off the fins, and rub it over with a little lemon-juice, to preserve
its whiteness. Set the fish in sufficient cold water to cover it; throw in salt, in the above
proportions, and a little vinegar, and bring it gradually to boil; simmer very gently till
the fish is done, which will be in about 10 minutes; but the time for boiling, of course, depends
entirely on the size of the fish. Serve it on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon, parsley,
horseradish, and a little lobster coral sprinkled over the fish. Send lobster or shrimp sauce
and plain melted butter to table with it.

Time.--After the water boils, a small brill, 10 minutes; a large brill, 15 to 20 minutes.

Average cost, from 4s. to 8s.

Seasonable from August to April.

    THE BRILL.--This fish resembles the sole, but is broader, and
    when large, is esteemed by many in a scarcely less degree than
    the turbot, whilst it is much cheaper. It is a fine fish, and is
    abundant in the London market.

TO CHOOSE BRILL.--The flesh of this fish, like that of turbot, should be of a yellowish tint,
and should be chosen on account of its thickness. If the flesh has a bluish tint, it is not good.

CODFISH.

231. Cod may be boiled whole; but a large head and shoulders are quite sufficient for a dish,
and contain all that is usually helped, because, when the thick part is done, the tail is insipid
and overdone. The latter, cut in slices, makes a very good dish for frying; or it may be salted
down and served with egg sauce and parsnips. Cod, when boiled quite fresh, is watery; salting
a little, renders it firmer.

    THE COD TRIBE.--The Jugular, characterized by bony gills, and
    ventral fins before the pectoral ones, commences the second of
    the Linnaean orders of fishes, and is a numerous tribe,
    inhabiting only the depths of the ocean, and seldom visiting the
    fresh waters. They have a smooth head, and the gill membrane has
    seven rays. The body is oblong, and covered with deciduous
    scales. The fins are all inclosed in skin, whilst their rays are
    unarmed. The ventral fins are slender, and terminate in a point.
    Their habits are gregarious, and they feed on smaller fish and
    other marine animals.

COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS.

232. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish; 5 oz. of salt to each gallon of water.

Mode.--Cleanse the fish thoroughly, and rub a little salt over the thick part and inside of
the fish, 1 or 2 hours before dressing it, as this very much improves the flavour. Lay it in
the fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover it. Be very particular not to pour the
water on the fish, as it is liable to break it, and only keep it just simmering. If the water
should boil away, add a little by pouring it in at the side of the kettle, and not on the fish.
Add salt in the above proportion, and bring it gradually to a boil. Skim very carefully, draw
it to the side of the fire, and let it gently simmer till done. Take it out and drain it; serve
on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon, horseradish, the roe and liver. (See Coloured
Plate C.)

Time.--According to size, 1/2 an hour, more or less. Average cost, from 3s. to 6s.

Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from November to March.

Note.--Oyster sauce and plain melted butter should be served with this.

TO CHOOSE COD.--The cod should be chosen for the table when it is plump and round near the
tail, when the hollow behind the head is deep, and when the sides are undulated as if they
were ribbed. The glutinous parts about the head lose their delicate flavour, after the fish
has been twenty-four hours out of the water. The great point by which the cod should be judged
is the firmness of its flesh; and, although the cod is not firm when it is alive, its quality
may be arrived at by pressing the finger into the flesh. If this rises immediately, the fish
is good; if not, it is stale. Another sign of its goodness is, if the fish, when it is cut,
exhibits a bronze appearance, like the silver side of a round of beef. When this is the case,
the flesh will be firm when cooked. Stiffness in a cod, or in any other fish, is a sure sign
of freshness, though not always of quality. Sometimes, codfish, though exhibiting signs of
rough usage, will eat much better than those with red gills, so strongly recommended by many
cookery-books. This appearance is generally caused by the fish having been knocked about at
sea, in the well-boats, in which they are conveyed from the fishing-grounds to market.

SALT COD, COMMONLY CALLED "SALT-FISH."

233. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish.

Mode.--Wash the fish, and lay it all night in water, with a 1/4 pint of vinegar. When thoroughly
soaked, take it out, see that it is perfectly clean, and put it in the fish-kettle with sufficient
cold water to cover it. Heat it gradually, but do not let it boil much, or the fish will be
hard. Skim well, and when done, drain the fish and put it on a napkin garnished with hard-boiled
eggs cut in rings.

Time.--About 1 hour. Average cost, 6d. per lb.

Seasonable in the spring.

Sufficient for each person, 1/4 lb.

Note.--Serve with egg sauce and parsnips. This is an especial dish on Ash Wednesday.

    PRESERVING COD.--Immediately as the cod are caught, their heads
    are cut off. They are then opened, cleaned, and salted, when
    they are stowed away in the hold of the vessel, in beds of five
    or six yards square, head to tail, with a layer of salt to each
    layer of fish. When they have lain in this state three or four
    days, in order that the water may drain from them, they are
    shifted into a different part of the vessel, and again salted.
    Here they remain till the vessel is loaded, when they are
    sometimes cut into thick pieces and packed in barrels for the
    greater convenience of carriage.

COD SOUNDS.

Should be well soaked in salt and water, and thoroughly washed before dressing them. They are
considered a great delicacy, and may either be broiled, fried, or boiled: if they are boiled,
mix a little milk with the water.

COD SOUNDS, EN POULE.

234. INGREDIENTS.--For forcemeat, 12 chopped oysters, 3 chopped anchovies, 1/4 lb. of bread
crumbs, 1 oz. of butter, 2 eggs; seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace to taste; 4 cod
sounds.

Mode.--Make the forcemeat by mixing the ingredients well together. Wash the sounds, and boil
them in milk and water for 1/2 an hour; take them out and let them cool. Cover each with a
layer of forcemeat, roll them up in a nice form, and skewer them. Rub over with lard, dredge
with flour, and cook them gently before the fire in a Dutch oven. Sufficient for 4 persons.

    THE SOUNDS IN CODFISH.--These are the air or swimming bladders,
    by means of which the fishes are enabled to ascend or descend in
    the water. In the Newfoundland fishery they are taken out
    previous to incipient putrefaction, washed from their slime and
    salted for exportation. The tongues are also cured and packed up
    in barrels; whilst, from the livers, considerable quantities of
    oil are extracted, this oil having been found possessed of the
    most nourishing properties, and particularly beneficial in cases
    of pulmonary affections.

COD PIE.

(Economical.)

I.

235. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold cod, 12 oysters, sufficient melted butter to moisten
it; mashed potatoes enough to fill up the dish.

Mode.--Flake the fish from the bone, and carefully take away all the skin. Lay it in a pie-dish,
pour over the melted butter and oysters (or oyster sauce, if there is any left), and cover
with mashed potatoes. Bake for 1/2 an hour, and send to table of a nice brown colour.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Seasonable from November to March.

II.

236. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of cod; pepper and salt to taste; 1/2 a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg,
1 large blade of pounded mace, 2 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of stock No. 107, a paste crust (see
Pastry). For sauce, 1 tablespoonful of stock, 1/4 pint of cream or milk, thickening of flour
or butter; lemon-peel chopped very fine to taste; 12 oysters.

Mode.--Lay the cod in salt for 4 hours, then wash it and place it in a dish; season, and add
the butter and stock; cover with the crust, and bake for 1 hour, or rather more. Now make the
sauce, by mixing the ingredients named above; give it one boil, and pour it into the pie by
a hole made at the top of the crust, which can easily be covered by a small piece of pastry
cut and baked in any fanciful shape--such as a leaf, or otherwise.

Time.--1-1/2 hour. Average cost, with fresh fish, 2s. 6d.

Seasonable from November to March.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Note.--The remains of cold fish may be used for this pie.

CURRIED COD.

237. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of large cod, or the remains of any cold fish; 3 oz. of butter,
1 onion sliced, a teacupful of white stock, thickening of butter and flour, 1 small teaspoonful
of curry-powder, 1/4 pint of cream, salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Flake the fish, and fry it of a nice brown colour with the butter and onions; put this
in a stewpan, add the stock and thickening, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir the curry-powder
into the cream; put it, with the seasoning, to the other ingredients; give one boil, and serve.

Time.--3/4 hour. Average cost, with fresh fish, 3s.

Seasonable from November to March.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

    THE FOOD OF THE COD.--This chiefly consists of the smaller
    species of the scaly tribes, shell-fish, crabs, and worms. Their
    voracity is very great, and they will bite at any small body
    they see moved by the water, even stones and pebbles, which are
    frequently found in their stomachs. They sometimes attain a
    great size, but their usual weight is from 14 to 40 lbs.

COD A LA CREME.

238. INGREDIENTS.--1 large slice of cod, 1 oz. of butter, 1 chopped shalot, a little minced
parsley, 1/4 teacupful of white stock, 1/4 pint of milk or cream, flour to thicken, cayenne
and lemon-juice to taste, 1/4 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.

Mode.--Boil the cod, and while hot, break it into flakes; put the butter, shalot, parsley,
and stock into a stewpan, and let them boil for 5 minutes. Stir in sufficient flour to thicken,
and pour to it the milk or cream. Simmer for 10 minutes, add the cayenne and sugar, and, when
liked, a little lemon-juice. Put the fish in the sauce to warm gradually, but do not let it
boil. Serve in a dish garnished with croûtons.

Time.--Rather more than 1/2 hour. Average cost, with cream, 2s.

Seasonable from November to March.

Sufficient for 3 persons.

Note.--The remains of fish from the preceding day answer very well for this dish.

COD A LA BECHAMEL.

239. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold cod, 4 tablespoonfuls of béchamel (see Sauces), 2 oz.
butter; seasoning to taste of pepper and salt; fried bread, a few bread crumbs.

Mode.--Flake the cod carefully, leaving out all skin and bone; put the béchamel in a stewpan
with the butter, and stir it over the fire till the latter is melted; add seasoning, put in
the fish, and mix it well with the sauce. Make a border of fried bread round the dish, lay
in the fish, sprinkle over with bread crumbs, and baste with butter. Brown either before the
fire or with a salamander, and garnish with toasted bread cut in fanciful shapes.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the fish, 6d.

    THE HABITAT OF THE COD.--This fish is found only in the seas of
    the northern parts of the world, between the latitudes of 45°
    and 66°. Its great rendezvous are the sandbanks of Newfoundland,
    Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and New England. These places are its
    favourite resorts; for there it is able to obtain great
    quantities of worms, a food peculiarly grateful to it. Another
    cause of its attachment to these places has been said to be on
    account of the vicinity to the Polar seas, where it returns to
    spawn. Few are taken north of Iceland, and the shoals never
    reach so far south as the Straits of Gibraltar. Many are taken
    on the coasts of Norway, in the Baltic, and off the Orkneys,
    which, prior to the discovery of Newfoundland, formed one of the
    principal fisheries. The London market is supplied by those
    taken between the Dogger Bank, the Well Bank, and Cromer, on the
    east coast of England.

COD A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.

240. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of cod, 1/4 lb. of butter, a little chopped shalot and parsley;
pepper to taste, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, or rather less, when the flavour is not
liked; the juice of 1/4 lemon.

Mode.--Boil the cod, and either leave it whole, or, what is still better, flake it from the
bone, and take off the skin. Put it into a stewpan with the butter, parsley, shalot, pepper,
and nutmeg. Melt the butter gradually, and be very careful that it does not become like oil.
When all is well mixed and thoroughly hot, add the lemon-juice, and serve.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, 2s. 6d.; with remains of cold fish, 5d.

Seasonable from November to March.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Note.--Cod that has been left will do for this.

    THE SEASON FOR FISHING COD.--The best season for catching cod is
    from the beginning of February to the end of April; and although
    each fisherman engaged in taking them, catches no more than one
    at a time, an expert hand will sometimes take four hundred in a
    day. The employment is excessively fatiguing, from the weight of
    the fish as well as from the coldness of the climate.

COD A L'ITALIENNE.

241. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of crimped cod, 1 shalot, 1 slice of ham minced very fine, 1/2
pint of white stock, No. 107; when liked, 1/2 teacupful of cream; salt to taste; a few drops
of garlic vinegar, a little lemon-juice, 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.

Mode.--Chop the shalots, mince the ham very fine, pour on the stock, and simmer for 15 minutes.
If the colour should not be good, add cream in the above proportion, and strain it through
a fine sieve; season it, and put in the vinegar, lemon-juice, and sugar. Now boil the cod,
take out the middle bone, and skin it; put it on the dish without breaking, and pour the sauce
over it.

Time.--3/4 hour. Average cost, 3s. 6d., with fresh fish.

Seasonable from November to March.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

    THE FECUNDITY OF THE COD.--In our preceding remarks on the
    natural history of fishes, we have spoken of the amazing
    fruitfulness of this fish; but in this we see one more instance
    of the wise provision which Nature has made for supplying the
    wants of man. So extensive has been the consumption of this
    fish, that it is surprising that it has not long ago become
    extinct; which would certainly have been the case, had it not
    been for its wonderful powers of reproduction. "So early as
    1368," says Dr. Cloquet, "the inhabitants of Amsterdam had
    dispatched fishermen to the coast of Sweden; and in the first
    quarter of 1792, from the ports of France only, 210 vessels went
    out to the cod-fisheries. Every year, however, upwards of 10,000
    vessels, of all nations, are employed in this trade, and bring
    into the commercial world more than 40,000,000 of salted and
    dried cod. If we add to this immense number, the havoc made
    among the legions of cod by the larger scaly tribes of the great
    deep, and take into account the destruction to which the young
    are exposed by sea-fowls and other inhabitants of the seas,
    besides the myriads of their eggs destroyed by accident, it
    becomes a miracle to find that such mighty multitudes of them
    are still in existence, and ready to continue the exhaustless
    supply. Yet it ceases to excite our wonder when we remember that
    the female can every year give birth to more than 9,000,000 at a
    time."

BAKED CARP.

242. INGREDIENTS--1 carp, forcemeat, bread crumbs, 1 oz. butter, 1/2 pint of stock No. 105,
1/2 pint of port wine, 6 anchovies, 2 onions sliced, 1 bay-leaf, a faggot of sweet herbs, flour
to thicken, the juice of 1 lemon; cayenne and salt to taste; 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.

Mode.--Stuff the carp with a delicate forcemeat, after thoroughly cleansing it, and sew it
up to prevent the stuffing from falling out. Rub it over with an egg, and sprinkle it with
bread crumbs, lay it in a deep earthen dish, and drop the butter, oiled, over the bread crumbs.
Add the stock, onions, bay-leaf, herbs, wine, and anchovies, and bake for 1 hour. Put 1 oz.
of butter into a stewpan, melt it, and dredge in sufficient flour to dry it up; put in the
strained liquor from the carp, stir frequently, and when it has boiled, add the lemon-juice
and seasoning. Serve the carp on a dish garnished with parsley and cut lemon, and the sauce
in a boat.

Time.--1-1/4 hour. Average cost. Seldom bought.

Seasonable from March to October.

Sufficient for 1 or 2 persons.

    THE CARP.--This species of fish inhabit the fresh waters, where
    they feed on worms, insects, aquatic plants, small fish, clay,
    or mould. Some of them are migratory. They have very small
    mouths and no teeth, and the gill membrane has three rays. The
    body is smooth, and generally whitish. The carp both grows and
    increases very fast, and is accounted the most valuable of all
    fish for the stocking of ponds. It has been pronounced the queen
    of river-fish, and was first introduced to this country about
    three hundred years ago. Of its sound, or air-bladder, a kind of
    glue is made, and a green paint of its gall.

STEWED CARP.

243. INGREDIENTS.--1 carp, salt, stock No. 105, 2 onions, 6 cloves, 12 peppercorns, 1 blade
of mace, 1/4 pint of port wine, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste, a faggot
of savoury herbs.

Mode.--Scale the fish, clean it nicely, and, if very large, divide it; lay it in the stewpan,
after having rubbed a little salt on it, and put in sufficient stock to cover it; add the herbs,
onions, and spices, and stew gently for 1 hour, or rather more, should it be very large. Dish
up the fish with great care, strain the liquor, and add to it the port wine, lemon-juice, and
cayenne; give one boil, pour it over the fish, and serve.

Note.--This fish can be boiled plain, and served with parsley and butter. Chub and Char may
be cooked in the same manner as the above, as also Dace and Roach.

    THE AGE OF CARP.--This fish has been found to live 150 years.
    The pond in the garden of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, contained
    one that had lived there 70 years, and Gesner mentions an
    instance of one 100 years old. They are, besides, capable of
    being tamed. Dr. Smith, in his "Tour on the Continent," says, in
    reference to the prince of Condé's seat at Chantilly, "The most
    pleasing things about it were the immense shoals of very large
    carp, silvered over with age, like silver-fish, and perfectly
    tame; so that, when any passengers approached their watery
    habitation, they used to come to the shore in such numbers as to
    heave each other out of the water, begging for bread, of which a
    quantity was always kept at hand, on purpose to feed them. They
    would even allow themselves to be handled."

    THE CHUB.--This fish takes its name from its head, not only in
    England, but in other countries. It is a river-fish, and
    resembles the carp, but is somewhat longer. Its flesh is not in
    much esteem, being coarse, and, when out of season, full of
    small hairy bones. The head and throat are the best parts. The
    roe is also good.

    THE CHAR.--This is one of the most delicious of fish, being
    esteemed by some superior to the salmon. It is an inhabitant of
    the deep lakes of mountainous countries. Its flesh is rich and
    red, and full of fat. The largest and best kind is found in the
    lakes of Westmoreland, and, as it is considered a rarity, it is
    often potted and preserved.

    THE DACE, OR DARE.--This fish is gregarious, and is seldom above
    ten inches long; although, according to Linnaeus, it grows a
    foot and a half in length. Its haunts are in deep water, near
    piles of bridges, where the stream is gentle, over gravelly,
    sandy, or clayey bottoms; deep holes that are shaded, water-lily
    leaves, and under the foam caused by an eddy. In the warm months
    they are to be found in shoals on the shallows near to streams.
    They are in season about the end of April, and gradually improve
    till February, when they attain their highest condition. In that
    month, when just taken, scotched (crimped), and broiled, they
    are said to be more palatable than a fresh herring.

    THE ROACH.--This fish is found throughout Europe, and the
    western parts of Asia, in deep still rivers, of which it is an
    inhabitant. It is rarely more than a pound and a half in weight,
    and is in season from September till March. It is plentiful in
    England, and the finest are caught in the Thames. The proverb,
    "as sound as a roach," is derived from the French name of this
    fish being roche, which also means rock.

TO DRESS CRAB.

244. INGREDIENTS.--1 crab, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 ditto of oil; salt, white pepper,
and cayenne, to taste.

Mode.--Empty the shells, and thoroughly mix the meat with the above ingredients, and put it
in the large shell. Garnish with slices of cut lemon and parsley. The quantity of oil may be
increased when it is much liked. (See Coloured Plate I.)

Average cost, from 10d. to 2s.

Seasonable all the year; but not so good in May, June, and July.

Sufficient for 3 persons.

TO CHOOSE CRAB.--The middle-sized crab is the best; and the crab, like the lobster, should
be judged by its weight; for if light, it is watery.

HOT CRAB.

245. INGREDIENTS.--1 crab, nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 3 oz. of butter, 1/4 lb. of bread
crumbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.

Mode.--After having boiled the crab, pick the meat out from the shells, and mix with it the
nutmeg and seasoning. Cut up the butter in small pieces, and add the bread crumbs and vinegar.
Mix altogether, put the whole in the large shell, and brown before the fire or with a salamander.

Time.--1 hour.

    THE CRAB TRIBE.--The whole of this tribe of animals have the
    body covered with a hard and strong shell, and they live chiefly
    in the sea. Some, however, inhabit fresh waters, and a few live
    upon land. They feed variously, on aquatic or marine plants,
    small fish, molluscae, or dead bodies. The black-clawed
    species is found on the rocky coasts of both Europe and India,
    and is the same that is introduced to our tables, being much
    more highly esteemed as a food than many others of the tribe.
    The most remarkable feature in their history, is the changing of
    their shells, and the reproduction of their broken claws. The
    former occurs once a year, usually between Christmas and Easter,
    when the crabs retire to cavities in the rocks, or conceal
    themselves under great stones. Fishermen say that they will live
    confined in a pot or basket for several months together, without
    any other food than what is collected from the sea-water; and
    that, even in this situation, they will not decrease in weight.
    The hermit crab is another of the species, and has the
    peculiarity of taking possession of the deserted shell of some
    other animal, as it has none of its own. This circumstance was
    known to the ancients, and is alluded to in the following lines
    from Oppian:--
      The hermit fish, unarm'd by Nature, left
      Helpless and weak, grow strong by harmless theft.
      Fearful they stroll, and look with panting wish
      For the cast crust of some new-cover'd fish;
      Or such as empty lie, and deck the shore,
      Whose first and rightful owners are no more.
      They make glad seizure of the vacant room,
      And count the borrow'd shell their native home;
      Screw their soft limbs to fit the winding case,
      And boldly herd with the crustaceous race.

CRAYFISH.

246. Crayfish should be thrown into boiling water, to which has been added a good seasoning
of salt and a little vinegar. When done, which will be in 1/4 hour, take them out and drain
them. Let them cool, arrange them on a napkin, and garnish with plenty of double parsley.

Note.--This fish is frequently used for garnishing boiled turkey, boiled fowl, calf's head,
turbot, and all kinds of boiled fish.

POTTED CRAYFISH.

247. INGREDIENTS.--100 crayfish; pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz. butter.

Mode.--Boil the fish in salt and water; pick out all the meat and pound it in a mortar to a
paste. Whilst pounding, add the butter gradually, and mix in the spice and seasoning. Put it
in small pots, and pour over it clarified butter, carefully excluding the air.

Time.--15 minutes to boil the crayfish. Average cost, 2s. 9d.

Seasonable all the year.

JOHN DORY.

248. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.

Mode.--This fish, which is esteemed by most people a great delicacy, is dressed in the same
way as a turbot, which it resembles in firmness, but not in richness. Cleanse it thoroughly
and cut off the fins; lay it in a fish-kettle, cover with cold water, and add salt in the above
proportion. Bring it gradually to a boil, and simmer gently for 1/4 hour, or rather longer,
should the fish be very large. Serve on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon and parsley.

Average cost, 3s. to 5s. Seasonable all the year, but best from September to January.

Note.--Small John Dorie are very good, baked.

    THE DORU, or JOHN DORY.--This fish is of a yellowish golden
    colour, and is, in general, rare, although it is sometimes taken
    in abundance on the Devon and Cornish coasts. It is highly
    esteemed for the table, and its flesh, when dressed, is of a
    beautiful clear white. When fresh caught, it is tough, and,
    being a ground fish, it is not the worse for being kept two, or
    even three days before it is cooked.

BOILED EELS.

249. INGREDIENTS.--4 small eels, sufficient water to cover them; a large bunch of parsley.

Mode.--Choose small eels for boiling; put them in a stewpan with the parsley, and just sufficient
water to cover them; simmer till tender. Take them out, pour a little parsley and butter over
them, and serve some in a tureen.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, 6d. per lb.

Seasonable from June to March.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

    THE EEL TRIBE.--The Apodal, or bony-gilled and ventral-finned
    fish, of which the eel forms the first Linnaean tribe, in their
    general aspect and manners, approach, in some instances, very
    nearly to serpents. They have a smooth head and slippery skin,
    are in general naked, or covered with such small, soft, and
    distant scales, as are scarcely visible. Their bodies are long
    and slender, and they are supposed to subsist entirely on animal
    substances. There are about nine species of them, mostly found
    in the seas. One of them frequents our fresh waters, and three
    of the others occasionally pay a visit to our shores.

STEWED EELS.

I.

250. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of eels, 1 pint of rich strong stock, No. 104, 1 onion, 3 cloves,
a piece of lemon-peel, 1 glass of port or Madeira, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream; thickening of
flour; cayenne and lemon-juice to taste.

Mode.--Wash and skin the eels, and cut them into pieces about 3 inches long; pepper and salt
them, and lay them in a stewpan; pour over the stock, add the onion stuck with cloves, the
lemon-peel, and the wine. Stew gently for 1/2 hour, or rather more, and lift them carefully
on a dish, which keep hot. Strain the gravy, stir to the cream sufficient flour to thicken;
mix altogether, boil for 2 minutes, and add the cayenne and lemon-juice; pour over the eels
and serve.

Time.--3/4 hour. Average cost for this quantity, 2s. 3d.

Seasonable from June to March.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

    THE COMMON EEL.--This fish is known frequently to quit its
    native element, and to set off on a wandering expedition in the
    night, or just about the close of clay, over the meadows, in
    search of snails and other prey. It also, sometimes, betakes
    itself to isolated ponds, apparently for no other pleasure than
    that which may be supposed to be found in a change of
    habitation. This, of course, accounts for eels being found in
    waters which were never suspected to contain them. This rambling
    disposition in the eel has been long known to naturalists, and,
    from the following lines, it seems to have been known to the
    ancients:--

      "Thus the mail'd tortoise, and the wand'ring; eel,
      Oft to the neighbouring beach will silent steal."

II.

251. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of middling-sized eels, 1 pint of medium stock, No. 105, 1/4 pint
of port wine; salt, cayenne, and mace to taste; 1 teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, the juice
of 1/2 a lemon.

Mode.--Skin, wash, and clean the eels thoroughly; cut them into pieces 3 inches long, and put
them into strong salt and water for 1 hour; dry them well with a cloth, and fry them brown.
Put the stock on with the heads and tails of the eels, and simmer for 1/2 hour; strain it,
and add all the other ingredients. Put in the eels, and stew gently for 1/2 hour, when serve.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, 1s. 9d.

Seasonable from June to March.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

FRIED EELS.

252. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of eels, 1 egg, a few bread crumbs, hot lard.

Mode.--Wash the eels, cut them into pieces 3 inches long, trim and wipe them very dry; dredge
with flour, rub them over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs; fry of a nice brown in hot
lard. If the eels are small, curl them round, instead of cutting them up. Garnish with fried
parsley.

Time.--20 minutes, or rather less. Average cost, 6d. per lb.

Seasonable from June to March.

Note.--Garfish may be dressed like eels, and either broiled or baked.

    THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE EEL.--"Having occasion," says Dr.
    Anderson, in the Bee, "to be once on a visit to a friend's
    house on Dee-side, in Aberdeenshire, I frequently delighted to
    walk by the banks of the river. I, one day, observed something
    like a black string moving along the edge of the water where it
    was quite shallow. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that
    this was a shoal of young eels, so closely joined together as to
    appear, on a superficial view, on continued body, moving briskly
    up against the stream. To avoid the retardment they experienced
    from the force of the current, they kept close along the water's
    edge the whole of the way, following all the bendings and
    sinuosities of the river. Where they were embayed, and in still
    water, the shoal dilated in breadth, so as to be sometimes
    nearly a foot broad; but when they turned a cape, where the
    current was strong, they were forced to occupy less space and
    press close to the shore, struggling very hard till they passed
    it. This shoal continued to move on, night and day without
    interruption for several weeks. Their progress might be at the
    rate of about a mile an hour. It was easy to catch the animals,
    though they were very active and nimble. They were eels
    perfectly well formed in every respect, but not exceeding two
    inches in length. I conceive that the shoal did not contain, on
    an average, less than from twelve to twenty in breadth; so that
    the number that passed, on the whole, must have been very great.
    Whence they came or whither they went, I know not; but the place
    where I saw this, was six miles from the sea."

EEL PIE.

253. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of eels, a little chopped parsley, 1 shalot; grated nutmeg; pepper
and salt to taste; the juice of 1/2 a lemon, small quantity of forcemeat, 1/4 pint of béchamel
(see Sauces); puff paste.

Mode.--Skin and wash the eels, cut them into pieces 2 inches long, and line the bottom of the
pie-dish with forcemeat. Put in the eels, and sprinkle them with the parsley, shalots, nutmeg,
seasoning, and lemon-juice, and cover with puff-paste. Bake for 1 hour, or rather more; make
the béchamel hot, and pour it into the pie.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour.

Seasonable from August to March.

COLLARED EEL.

254. INGREDIENTS.--1 large eel; pepper and salt to taste; 2 blades of mace, 2 cloves, a little
allspice very finely pounded, 6 leaves of sage, and a small bunch of herbs minced very small.

Mode.--Bone the eel and skin it; split it, and sprinkle it over with the ingredients, taking
care that the spices are very finely pounded, and the herbs chopped very small. Roll it up
and bind with a broad piece of tape, and boil it in water, mixed with a little salt and vinegar,
till tender. It may either be served whole or cut in slices; and when cold, the eel should
be kept in the liquor it was boiled in, but with a little more vinegar put to it.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, 6d. per lb.

Seasonable from August to March.

    HAUNTS OF THE EEL.--These are usually in mud, among weeds, under
    roots or stumps of trees, or in holes in the banks or the
    bottoms of rivers. Here they often grow to an enormous size,
    sometimes weighing as much as fifteen or sixteen pounds. They
    seldom come forth from their hiding-places except in the night;
    and, in winter, bury themselves deep in the mud, on account of
    their great susceptibility of cold.

EELS A LA TARTARE.

255. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of eels, 1 carrot, 1 onion, a little flour, 1 glass of sherry; salt,
pepper, and nutmeg to taste; bread crumbs, 1 egg, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.

Mode.--Rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan; cut up the carrot and onion, and stir them
over the fire for 5 minutes; dredge in a little flour, add the wine and seasoning, and boil
for 1/2 an hour. Skin and wash the eels, cut them into pieces, put them to the other ingredients,
and simmer till tender. When they are done, take them out, let them get cold, cover them with
egg and bread crumbs, and fry them of a nice brown. Put them on a dish, pour sauce piquante
over, and serve them hot. 8d., exclusive of the sauce piquante.

Seasonable from August to March. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

    VORACITY OF THE EEL.--We find in a note upon Isaac Walton, by
    Sir John Hawkins, that he knew of eels, when kept in ponds,
    frequently destroying ducks. From a canal near his house at
    Twickenham he himself missed many young ducks; and on draining,
    in order to clean it, great numbers of large eels were caught in
    the mud. When some of these were opened, there were found in
    their stomachs the undigested heads of the quacking tribe which
    had become their victims.

EELS EN MATELOTE.

256. INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 young onions, a few mushrooms, when obtainable; salt, pepper, and
nutmeg to taste; 1 laurel-leaf, 1/2 pint of port wine, 1/2 pint of medium stock, No. 105; butter
and flour to thicken; 2 lbs. of eels.

Mode.--Rub the stewpan with butter, dredge in a little flour, add the onions cut very small,
slightly brown them, and put in all the other ingredients. Wash, and cut up the eels into pieces
3 inches long; put them in the stewpan, and simmer for 1/2 hour. Make round the dish, a border
of croutons, or pieces of toasted bread; arrange the eels in a pyramid in the centre, and pour
over the sauce. 9d. for this quantity.

Seasonable from August to March. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

    TENACITY OF LIFE IN THE EEL.--There is no fish so tenacious of
    life as this. After it is skinned and cut in pieces, the parts
    will continue to move for a considerable time, and no fish will
    live so long out of water.

    THE LAMPREY.--With the Romans, this fish occupied a respectable
    rank among the piscine tribes, and in Britain it has at various
    periods stood high in public favour. It was the cause of the
    death of Henry I. of England, who ate so much of them, that it
    brought on an attack of indigestion, which carried him off. It
    is an inhabitant of the sea, ascending rivers, principally about
    the end of winter, and, after passing a few months in fresh
    water, returning again to its oceanic residence. It is most in
    season in March, April, and May, but is, by some, regarded as an
    unwholesome food, although looked on by others as a great
    delicacy. They are dressed as eels.

FISH AND OYSTER PIE.

257. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold fish, such as cod or haddock; 2 dozen oysters, pepper
and salt to taste, bread crumbs sufficient for the quantity of fish; 1/2 teaspoonful of grated
nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of finely-chopped parsley.

Mode.--Clear the fish from the bones, and put a layer of it in a pie-dish, which sprinkle with
pepper and salt; then a layer of bread crumbs, oysters, nutmeg, and chopped parsley. Repeat
this till the dish is quite full. You may form a covering either of bread crumbs, which should
be browned, or puff-paste, which should be cut into long strips, and laid in cross-bars over
the fish, with a line of the paste first laid round the edge. Before putting on the top, pour
in some made melted butter, or a little thin white sauce, and the oyster-liquor, and bake.

Time.--If made of cooked fish, 1/4 hour; if made of fresh fish and puff-paste, 3/4 hour.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Seasonable from September to April.

Note.--A nice little dish may be made by flaking any cold fish, adding a few oysters, seasoning
with pepper and salt, and covering with mashed potatoes; 1/4 hour will bake it.

FISH CAKE.

258. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of any cold fish, 1 onion, 1 faggot of sweet herbs; salt and
pepper to taste, 1 pint of water, equal quantities of bread crumbs and cold potatoes, 1/2 teaspoonful
of parsley, 1 egg, bread crumbs.

Mode.--Pick the meat from the bones of the fish, which latter put, with the head and fins,
into a stewpan with the water; add pepper and salt, the onion and herbs, and stew slowly for
gravy about 2 hours; chop the fish fine, and mix it well with bread crumbs and cold potatoes,
adding the parsley and seasoning; make the whole into a cake with the white of an egg, brush
it over with egg, cover with bread crumbs, and fry of a light brown; strain the gravy, pour
it over, and stew gently for 1/4 hour, stirring it carefully once or twice. Serve hot, and
garnish with slices of lemon and parsley.

Time--1/2 hour, after the gravy is made.

BOILED FLOUNDERS.

259. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the flounders, salt in the proportion of 6 oz.
to each gallon, a little vinegar.

Mode.--Pat on a kettle with enough water to cover the flounders, lay in the fish, add salt
and vinegar in the above proportions, and when it boils, simmer very gently for 5 minutes.
They must not boil fast, or they will break. Serve with plain melted butter, or parsley and butter.

Time.--After the water boils, 5 minutes.

Average cost, 3d. each.

Seasonable from August to November.

    THE FLOUNDER.--This comes under the tribe usually denominated
    Flat-fish, and is generally held in the smallest estimation of
    any among them. It is an inhabitant of both the seas and the
    rivers, while it thrives in ponds. On the English coasts it is
    very abundant, and the London market consumes it in large
    quantities. It is considered easy of digestion, and the Thames
    flounder is esteemed a delicate fish.

FRIED FLOUNDERS.

260. INGREDIENTS.--Flounders, egg, and bread crumbs; boiling lard.

Mode.--Cleanse the fish, and, two hours before they are wanted, rub them inside and out with
salt, to render them firm; wash and wipe them very dry, dip them into egg, and sprinkle over
with bread crumbs; fry them in boiling lard, dish on a hot napkin, and garnish with crisped
parsley.

Time.--From 5 to 10 minutes, according to size.

Average cost, 3d. each.

Seasonable from August to November.

Sufficient, 1 for each person.

GUDGEONS.

261. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs sufficient for the quantity of fish; hot lard.

Mode.--Do not scrape off the scales, but take out the gills and inside, and cleanse thoroughly;
wipe them dry, flour and dip them into egg, and sprinkle over with bread crumbs. Fry of a nice
brown.

Time.--3 or 4 minutes.

Average cost. Seldom bought.

Seasonable from March to July.

Sufficient, 3 for each person.

    THE GUDGEON.--This is a fresh-water fish, belonging to the carp
    genus, and is found in placid streams and lakes. It was highly
    esteemed by the Greeks, and was, at the beginning of supper,
    served fried at Rome. It abounds both in France and Germany; and
    is both excellent and numerous in some of the rivers of England.
    Its flesh is firm, well-flavoured, and easily digested.

GURNET, or GURNARD.

262. INGREDIENTS.--1 gurnet, 6 oz. of salt to each gallon of water.

Mode.--Cleanse the fish thoroughly, and cut off the fins; have ready some boiling water, with
salt in the above proportion; put the fish in, and simmer very gently for 1/2 hour. Parsley
and butter, or anchovy sauce, should be served with it.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Average cost. Seldom bought.

Seasonable from October to March, but in perfection in October.

Sufficient, a middling sized one for 2 persons.

Note.--This fish is frequently stuffed with forcemeat and baked.

    THE GURNET.-"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a souced
    gurnet," says Falstaff; which shows that this fish has been long
    known in England. It is very common on the British coasts, and
    is an excellent fish as food.

BAKED HADDOCKS.

263. INGREDIENTS.--A nice forcemeat (see Forcemeats), butter to taste, egg and bread crumbs.

Mode.--Scale and clean the fish, without cutting it open much; put in a nice delicate forcemeat,
and sew up the slit. Brush it over with egg, sprinkle over bread crumbs, and baste frequently
with butter. Garnish with parsley and cut lemon, and serve with a nice brown gravy, plain melted
butter, or anchovy sauce. The egg and bread crumbs can be omitted, and pieces of butter placed
over the fish.

Time.--Large haddock, 3/4 hour; moderate size, 1/4 hour.

Seasonable from August to February.

Average cost, from 9d. upwards.

Note.--Haddocks may be filleted, rubbed over with egg and bread crumbs, and fried a nice brown;
garnish with crisped parsley.

    THE HADDOCK.--This fish migrates in immense shoals, and arrives
    on the Yorkshire coast about the middle of winter. It is an
    inhabitant of the northern seas of Europe, but does not enter
    the Baltic, and is not known in the Mediterranean. On each side
    of the body, just beyond the gills, it has a dark spot, which
    superstition asserts to be the impressions of the finger and
    thumb of St. Peter, when taking the tribute money out of a fish
    of this species.

BOILED HADDOCK.

264. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish; 1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.

Mode.--Scrape the fish, take out the inside, wash it thoroughly, and lay it in a kettle, with
enough water to cover it and salt in the above proportion. Simmer gently from 15 to 20 minutes,
or rather more, should the fish be very large. For small haddocks, fasten the tails in their
mouths, and put them into boiling water. 10 to 15 minutes will cook them. Serve with plain
melted butter, or anchovy sauce.

Time.--Large haddock, 1/2 hour; small, 1/4 hour, or rather less.

Average cost, from 9d. upwards.

Seasonable from August to February.

    WEIGHT OF THE HADDOCK.--The haddock seldom grows to any great
    size. In general, they do not weigh more than two or three
    pounds, or exceed ten or twelve inches in size. Such are
    esteemed very delicate eating; but they have been caught three
    feet long, when their flesh is coarse.

DRIED HADDOCK.

I.

265. Dried haddock should be gradually warmed through, either before or over a nice clear fire.
Hub a little piece of butter over, just before sending it to table.

II.

266. INGREDIENTS.--1 large thick haddock, 2 bay-leaves, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs, not
forgetting parsley, a little butter and pepper; boiling water.

Mode.--Cut up the haddock into square pieces, make a basin hot by means of hot water, which
pour out. Lay in the fish, with the bay-leaves and herbs; cover with boiling water; put a plate
over to keep in the steam, and let it remain for 10 minutes. Take out the slices, put them
in a hot dish, rub over with butter and pepper, and serve.

Time.--10 minutes. Seasonable at any time, but best in winter.

    THE FINNAN HADDOCK.--This is the common haddock cured and dried,
    and takes its name from the fishing-village of Findhorn, near
    Aberdeen, in Scotland, where the art has long attained to
    perfection. The haddocks are there hung up for a day or two in
    the smoke of peat, when they are ready for cooking, and are
    esteemed, by the Scotch, a great delicacy. In London, an
    imitation of them is made by washing the fish over with
    pyroligneous acid, and hanging it up in a dry place for a few
    days.

RED HERRINGS, or YARMOUTH BLOATERS.

267. The best way to cook these is to make incisions in the skin across the fish, because they
do not then require to be so long on the fire, and will be far better than when cut open. The
hard roe makes a nice relish by pounding it in a mortar, with a little anchovy, and spreading
it on toast. If very dry, soak in warm water 1 hour before dressing.

    THE RED HERRING.--Red herrings lie twenty-four hours in the
    brine, when they are taken out and hung up in a smoking-house
    formed to receive them. A brushwood fire is then kindled beneath
    them, and when they are sufficiently smoked and dried, they are
    put into barrels for carriage.

BAKED WHITE HERRINGS.

268. INGREDIENTS.--12 herrings, 4 bay-leaves, 12 cloves, 12 allspice, 2 small blades of mace,
cayenne pepper and salt to taste, sufficient vinegar to fill up the dish.

Mode.--Take the herrings, cut off the heads, and gut them. Put them in a pie-dish, heads and
tails alternately, and, between each layer, sprinkle over the above ingredients. Cover the
fish with the vinegar, and bake for 1/2 hour, but do not use it till quite cold. The herrings
may be cut down the front, the backbone taken out, and closed again. Sprats done in this way
are very delicious.

Time.--1/2 an hour.

Average cost, 1d. each.

TO CHOOSE THE HERRING.--The more scales this fish has, the surer the sign of its freshness.
It should also have a bright and silvery look; but if red about the head, it is a sign that
it has been dead for some time.

    THE HERRING.--The herring tribe are found in the greatest
    abundance in the highest northern latitudes, where they find a
    quiet retreat, and security from their numerous enemies. Here
    they multiply beyond expression, and, in shoals, come forth from
    their icy region to visit other portions of the great deep. In
    June they are found about Shetland, whence they proceed down to
    the Orkneys, where they divide, and surround the islands of
    Great Britain and Ireland. The principal British
    herring-fisheries are off the Scotch and Norfolk coasts; and the
    fishing is always carried on by means of nets, which are usually
    laid at night; for, if stretched by day, they are supposed to
    frighten the fish away. The moment the herring is taken out of
    the water it dies. Hence the origin of the common saying, "dead
    as a herring."

KEGEREE.

269. INGREDIENTS.--Any cold fish, 1 teacupful of boiled rice, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful
of mustard, 2 soft-boiled eggs, salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Pick the fish carefully from the bones, mix with the other ingredients, and serve very
hot. The quantities may be varied according to the amount of fish used.

Time.--1/4 hour after the rice is boiled.

Average cost, 5d., exclusive of the fish.

TO BOIL LOBSTERS.

270. When the shell is incrusted, it is a sign they are old: medium-sized lobsters are the
best. Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion; put in the lobster,
and keep it boiling quickly from 20 minutes to 3/4 hour, according to its size, and do not
forget to skim well. If it boils too long, the meat becomes thready, and if not done enough,
the spawn is not red: this must be obviated by great attention. Hub the shell over with a little
butter or sweet oil, which wipe off again.

Time.--Small lobster, 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; large ditto, 1/2 to 1/3 hour.

Average cost, medium size, 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d.

Seasonable all the year, but best from March to October.

TO CHOOSE LOBSTERS.--This shell-fish, if it has been cooked alive, as it ought to have been,
will have a stiffness in the tail, which, if gently raised, will return with a spring. Care,
however, must be taken in thus proving it; for if the tail is pulled straight out, it will
not return; when the fish might be pronounced inferior, which, in reality, may not be the case.
In order to be good, lobsters should be weighty for their bulk; if light, they will be watery;
and those of the medium size, are always the best. Small-sized lobsters are cheapest, and answer
very well for sauce. In boiling lobsters, the appearance of the shell will be much improved
by rubbing over it a little butter or salad-oil on being immediately taken from the pot.

    THE LOBSTER.--This is one of the crab tribe, and is found on
    most of the rocky coasts of Great Britain. Some are caught with
    the hand, but the larger number in pots, which serve all the
    purposes of a trap, being made of osiers, and baited with
    garbage. They are shaped like a wire mousetrap; so that when the
    lobsters once enter them, they cannot get out again. They are
    fastened to a cord and sunk in the sea, and their place marked
    by a buoy. The fish is very prolific, and deposits of its eggs
    in the sand, where they are soon hatched. On the coast of
    Norway, they are very abundant, and it is from there that the
    English metropolis is mostly supplied. They are rather
    indigestible, and, as a food, not so nurtritive as they are
    generally supposed to be.

HOT LOBSTER.

271. INGREDIENTS.--1 lobster, 2 oz. of butter, grated nutmeg; salt, pepper, and pounded mace,
to taste; bread crumbs, 2 eggs.

Mode.--Pound the meat of the lobster to a smooth paste with the butter and seasoning, and add
a few bread crumbs. Beat the eggs, and make the whole mixture into the form of a lobster; pound
the spawn, and sprinkle over it. Bake 1/4 hour, and just before serving, lay over it the tail
and body shell, with the small claws underneath, to resemble a lobster.

Time.--1/4 hour. Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

LOBSTER SALAD.

272. INGREDIENTS.--1 hen lobster, lettuces, endive, small salad (whatever is in season), a
little chopped beetroot, 2 hard-boiled eggs, a few slices of cucumber. For dressing, equal
quantities of oil and vinegar, 1 teaspoonful of made mustard, the yolks of 2 eggs; cayenne
and salt to taste; 3 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce. These ingredients should be mixed perfectly
smooth, and form a creamy-looking sauce.

Mode.--Wash the salad, and thoroughly dry it by shaking it in a cloth. Cut up the lettuces
and endive, pour the dressing on them, and lightly throw in the small salad. Mix all well together
with the pickings from the body of the lobster; pick the meat from the shell, cut it up into
nice square pieces, put half in the salad, the other half reserve for garnishing. Separate
the yolks from the whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs; chop the whites very fine, and rub the yolks
through a sieve, and afterwards the coral from the inside. Arrange the salad lightly on a glass
dish, and garnish, first with a row of sliced cucumber, then with the pieces of lobster, the
yolks and whites of the eggs, coral, and beetroot placed alternately, and arranged in small
separate bunches, so that the colours contrast nicely.

Average cost, 3s. 6d. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from April to October; may be had all the year, but salad is scarce and expensive
in winter.

Note.--A few crayfish make a pretty garnishing to lobster salad.

    THE SHELL OF THE LOBSTER.--Like the others of its tribe, the
    lobster annually casts its shell. Previously to its throwing off
    the old one, it appears sick, languid, and restless, but in the
    course of a few days it is entirely invested in its new coat of
    armour. Whilst it is in a defenceless state, however, it seeks
    some lonely place, where it may lie undisturbed, and escape the
    horrid fate of being devoured by some of its own species who
    have the advantage of still being encased in their mail.

LOBSTER (a la Mode Francaise).

273. INGREDIENTS.--1 lobster, 4 tablespoonfuls of white stock, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, pounded
mace, and cayenne to taste; bread crumbs.

Mode.--Pick the meat from the shell, and cut it up into small square pieces; put the stock,
cream, and seasoning into a stewpan, add the lobster, and let it simmer gently for 6 minutes.
Serve it in the shell, which must be nicely cleaned, and have a border of puff-paste; cover
it with bread crumbs, place small pieces of butter over, and brown before the fire, or with
a salamander.

    CELERITY OF THE LOBSTER.--In its element, the lobster is able to
    run with great speed upon its legs, or small claws, and, if
    alarmed, to spring, tail foremost, to a considerable distance,
    "even," it is said, "with the swiftness of a bird flying."
    Fishermen have seen some of them pass about thirty feet with a
    wonderful degree of swiftness. When frightened, they will take
    their spring, and, like a chamois of the Alps, plant themselves
    upon the very spot upon which they designed to hold themselves.

LOBSTER CURRY (an Entree).

274. INGREDIENTS.--1 lobster, 2 onions, 1 oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1/2
pint of medium stock, No. 105, the juice of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Pick the meat from the shell, and cut it into nice square pieces; fry the onions of
a pale brown in the butter, stir in the curry-powder and stock, and simmer till it thickens,
when put in the lobster; stew the whole slowly for 1/2 hour, and stir occasionally; and just
before sending to table, put in the lemon-juice. Serve boiled rice with it, the same as for
other curries.

Time.--Altogether, 3/4 hour. Average cost, 3s.

Seasonable at any time.

LOBSTER CUTLETS (an Entree).

275. INGREDIENTS.--1 large hen lobster, 1 oz. fresh butter, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, pounded
mace, grated nutmeg, cayenne and white pepper to taste, egg, and bread crumbs.

Mode.--Pick the meat from the shell, and pound it in a mortar with the butter, and gradually
add the mace and seasoning, well mixing the ingredients; beat all to a smooth paste, and add
a little of the spawn; divide the mixture into pieces of an equal size, and shape them like
cutlets. They should not be very thick. Brush them over with egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs,
and stick a short piece of the small claw in the top of each; fry them of a nice brown in boiling
lard, and drain them before the fire, on a sieve reversed; arrange them nicely on a dish, and
pour béchamel in the middle, but not over the cutlets.

Time.--About 8 minutes after the cutlets are made.

Average cost for this dish, 2s. 9d.

Seasonable all the year. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

    ANCIENT MODE OF COOKING THE LOBSTER.--When this fish was to be
    served for the table, among the ancients, it was opened
    lengthwise, and filled with a gravy composed of coriander and
    pepper. It was then put on the gridiron and slowly cooked,
    whilst it was being basted with the same kind of gravy with
    which the flesh had become impregnated.

TO DRESS LOBSTERS.

276. When the lobster is boiled, rub it over with a little salad-oil, which wipe off again;
separate the body from the tail, break off the great claws, and crack them at the joints, without
injuring the meat; split the tail in halves, and arrange all neatly in a dish, with the body
upright in the middle, and garnish with parsley. (See Coloured Plate, H.)

LOBSTER PATTIES (an Entree).

277. INGREDIENTS.--Minced lobster, 4 tablespoonfuls of béchamel, 6 drops of anchovy sauce,
lemon-juice, cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Line the patty-pans with puff-paste, and put into each a small piece of bread: cover
with paste, brush over with egg, and bake of a light colour. Take as much lobster as is required,
mince the meat very fine, and add the above ingredients; stir it over the fire for 6 minutes;
remove the lids of the patty-cases, take out the bread, fill with the mixture, and replace
the covers.

Seasonable at any time.

    LOCAL ATTACHMENT OF THE LOBSTER.--It is said that the attachment
    of this animal is strong to some particular parts of the sea, a
    circumstance celebrated in the following lines:--

      "Nought like their home the constant lobsters prize,
      And foreign shores and seas unknown despise.
      Though cruel hands the banish'd wretch expel,
      And force the captive from his native cell,
      He will, if freed, return with anxious care,
      Find the known rock, and to his home repair;
      No novel customs learns in different seas,
      But wonted food and home-taught manners please."

POTTED LOBSTER.

278. INGREDIENTS.--2 lobsters; seasoning to taste, of nutmeg, pounded mace, white pepper, and
salt; 1/4 lb. of butter, 3 or 4 bay-leaves.

Mode.--Take out the meat carefully from the shell, but do not cut it up. Put some butter at
the bottom of a dish, lay in the lobster as evenly as possible, with the bay-leaves and seasoning
between. Cover with butter, and bake for 3/4 hour in a gentle oven. When done, drain the whole
on a sieve, and lay the pieces in potting-jars, with the seasoning about them. When cold, pour
over it clarified butter, and, if very highly seasoned, it will keep some time.

Time.--3/4 hour. Average cost for this quantity, 4s. 4d.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Potted lobster may be used cold, or as fricassee with cream sauce.

    How the Lobster Feeds.--The pincers of the lobster's large claws
    are furnished with nobs, and those of the other, are always
    serrated. With the former, it keeps firm hold of the stalks of
    submarine plants, and with the latter, it cuts and minces its
    food with great dexterity. The knobbed, or numb claw, as it is
    called by fishermen, is sometimes on the right and sometimes on
    the left, indifferently.

BAKED MACKEREL.

279. INGREDIENTS.--4 middling-sized mackerel, a nice delicate forcemeat (see Forcemeats), 3
oz. of butter; pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Clean the fish, take out the roes, and fill up with forcemeat, and sew up the slit.
Flour, and put them in a dish, heads and tails alternately, with the roes; and, between each
layer, put some little pieces of butter, and pepper and salt. Bake for 1/2 an hour, and either
serve with plain melted butter or a maître d'hôtel sauce.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost for this quantity, 1s. 10d.

Seasonable from April to July.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Note.--Baked mackerel may be dressed in the same way as baked herrings (see No. 268), and may
also be stewed in wine.

    WEIGHT OF THE MACKEREL.--The greatest weight of this fish seldom
    exceeds 2 lbs., whilst their ordinary length runs between 14 and
    20 inches. They die almost immediately after they are taken from
    their element, and, for a short time, exhibit a phosphoric
    light.

BOILED MACKEREL.

280. Fennel sauce and plain melted butter are the usual accompaniments to boiled mackerel;
but caper or anchovy sauce is sometimes served with it. (See Coloured Plate, F.)

Time.--After the water boils, 10 minutes; for large mackerel, allow more time.

Average cost, from 4d.

Seasonable from April to July.

Note.--When variety is desired, fillet the mackerel, boil it, and pour over parsley and butter;
send some of this, besides, in a tureen.

BROILED MACKEREL.

281. INGREDIENTS.--Pepper and salt to taste, a small quantity of oil.

Mode.--Mackerel should never be washed when intended to be broiled, but merely wiped very clean
and dry, after taking out the gills and insides. Open the back, and put in a little pepper,
salt, and oil; broil it over a clear fire, turn it over on both sides, and also on the back.
When sufficiently cooked, the flesh can be detached from the bone, which will be in about 15
minutes for a small mackerel. Chop a little parsley, work it up in the butter, with pepper
and salt to taste, and a squeeze of lemon-juice, and put it in the back. Serve before the butter
is quite melted, with a maître d'hôtel sauce in a tureen.

Time.--Small mackerel 15 minutes. Average cost, from 4d.

Seasonable from April to July.

    THE MACKEREL.--This is not only one of the most
    elegantly-formed, but one of the most beautifully-coloured
    fishes, when taken out of the sea, that we have. Death, in some
    degree, impairs the vivid splendour of its colours; but it does
    not entirely obliterate them. It visits the shores of Great
    Britain in countless shoals, appearing about March, off the
    Land's End; in the bays of Devonshire, about April; off Brighton
    in the beginning of May; and on the coast of Suffolk about the
    beginning of June. In the Orkneys they are seen till August; but
    the greatest fishery is on the west coasts of England.

TO CHOOSE MACKEREL.--In choosing this fish, purchasers should, to a great extent, be regulated
by the brightness of its appearance. If it have a transparent, silvery hue, the flesh is good;
but if it be red about the head, it is stale.

FILLETS OF MACKEREL.

282. INGREDIENTS.--2 large mackerel, 1 oz. butter, 1 small bunch of chopped herbs, 3 tablespoonfuls
of medium stock, No. 105, 3 tablespoonfuls of béchamel (see Sauces); salt, cayenne, and lemon-juice
to taste.

Mode.--Clean the fish, and fillet it; scald the herbs, chop them fine, and put them with the
butter and stock into a stewpan. Lay in the mackerel, and simmer very gently for 10 minutes;
take them out, and put them on a hot dish. Dredge in a little flour, add the other ingredients,
give one boil, and pour it over the mackerel.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost for this quantity, 1s. 6d.

Seasonable from April to July.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Note.--Fillets of mackerel may be covered with egg and bread crumbs, and fried of a nice brown.
Serve with maître d'hôtel sauce and plain melted butter.

    THE VORACITY OF THE MACKEREL.--The voracity of this fish is very
    great, and, from their immense numbers, they are bold in
    attacking objects of which they might, otherwise, be expected to
    have a wholesome dread. Pontoppidan relates an anecdote of a
    sailor belonging to a ship lying in one of the harbours on the
    coast of Norway, who, having gone into the sea to bathe, was
    suddenly missed by his companions; in the course of a few
    minutes, however, he was seen on the surface, with great numbers
    of mackerel clinging to him by their mouths. His comrades
    hastened in a boat to his assistance; but when they had struck
    the fishes from him and got him up, they found he was so
    severely bitten, that he shortly afterward expired.

PICKLED MACKEREL.

283. INGREDIENTS.--12 peppercorns, 2 bay-leaves, 1/2 pint of vinegar, 4 mackerel.

Mode.--Boil the mackerel as in the recipe No. 282, and lay them in a dish; take half the liquor
they were boiled in; add as much vinegar, peppercorns, and bay-leaves; boil for 10 minutes,
and when cold, pour over the fish.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

    MACKEREL GARUM.--This brine, so greatly esteemed by the
    ancients, was manufactured from various kinds of fishes. When
    mackerel was employed, a few of them were placed in a small
    vase, with a large quantity of salt, which was well stirred, and
    then left to settle for some hours. On the following day, this
    was put into an earthen pot, which was uncovered, and placed in
    a situation to get the rays of the sun. At the end of two or
    three months, it was hermetically sealed, after having had added
    to it a quantity of old wine, equal to one third of the mixture.

GREY MULLET.

284. Serve with anchovy sauce and plain melted butter.

Time.--According to size, 1/4 to 3/4 hour.

Average cost, 8d. per lb.

Seasonable from July to October.

    THE GREY MULLET.--This is quite a different fish from the red
    mullet, is abundant on the sandy coasts of Great Britain, and
    ascends rivers for miles. On the south coast it is very
    plentiful, and is considered a fine fish. It improves more than
    any other salt-water fish when kept in ponds.

RED MULLET.

285. INGREDIENTS.--Oiled paper, thickening of butter and flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of anchovy
sauce, 1 glass of sherry; cayenne and salt to taste.

Mode.--Clean the fish, take out the gills, but leave the inside, fold in oiled paper, and bake
them gently. When done, take the liquor that flows from the fish, add a thickening of butter
kneaded with flour; put in the other ingredients, and let it boil for 2 minutes. Serve the
sauce in a tureen, and the fish, either with or without the paper cases.

Time.--About 25 minutes.

Average cost, 1s. each.

Seasonable at any time, but more plentiful in summer.

Note.--Red mullet may be broiled, and should be folded in oiled paper, the same as in the preceding
recipe, and seasoned with pepper and salt. They may be served without sauce; but if any is
required, use melted butter, Italian or anchovy sauce. They should never be plain boiled.

    THE STRIPED RED MULLET.--This fish was very highly esteemed by
    the ancients, especially by the Romans, who gave the most
    extravagant prices for it. Those of 2 lbs. weight were valued at
    about £15 each; those of 4 lbs. at £60, and, in the reign of
    Tiberius, three of them were sold for £209. To witness the
    changing loveliness of their colour during their dying agonies,
    was one of the principal reasons that such a high price was paid
    for one of these fishes. It frequents our Cornish and Sussex
    coasts, and is in high request, the flesh being firm, white, and
    well flavoured.

FRIED OYSTERS.

286. INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, 2 oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, a little chopped
lemon-peel, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.

Mode.--Boil the oysters for 1 minute in their own liquor, and drain them; fry them with the
butter, ketchup, lemon-peel, and parsley; lay them on a dish, and garnish with fried potatoes,
toasted sippets, and parsley. This is a delicious delicacy, and is a favourite Italian dish.

Time.--5 minutes. Average cost for this quantity, 1s. 9d.

Seasonable from September to April.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

    THE EDIBLE OYSTER:--This shell-fish is almost universally
    distributed near the shores of seas in all latitudes, and they
    especially abound on the coasts of France and Britain. The
    coasts most celebrated, in England, for them, are those of Essex
    and Suffolk. Here they are dredged up by means of a net with an
    iron scraper at the mouth, that is dragged by a rope from a boat
    over the beds. As soon as taken from their native beds, they are
    stored in pits, formed for the purpose, furnished with sluices,
    through which, at the spring tides, the water is suffered to
    flow. This water, being stagnant, soon becomes green in warm
    weather; and, in a few days afterwards, the oysters acquire the
    same tinge, which increases their value in the market. They do
    not, however, attain their perfection and become fit for sale
    till the end of six or eight weeks. Oysters are not considered
    proper for the table till they are about a year and a half old;
    so that the brood of one spring are not to be taken for sale,
    till, at least, the September twelvemonth afterwards.

SCALLOPED OYSTERS.

I.

287. INGREDIENTS.--Oysters, say 1 pint, 1 oz. butter, flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of white stock,
2 tablespoonfuls of cream; pepper and salt to taste; bread crumbs, oiled butter.

Mode.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, take them out, beard them, and strain the liquor
free from grit. Put 1 oz. of batter into a stewpan; when melted, dredge in sufficient flour
to dry it up; add the stock, cream, and strained liquor, and give one boil. Put in the oysters
and seasoning; let them gradually heat through, but not boil. Have ready the scallop-shells
buttered; lay in the oysters, and as much of the liquid as they will hold; cover them over
with bread crumbs, over which drop a little oiled butter. Brown them in the oven, or before
the fire, and serve quickly, and very hot.

Time.--Altogether, 1/4 hour.

Average cost for this quantity, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

II.

Prepare the oysters as in the preceding recipe, and put them in a scallop-shell or saucer,
and between each layer sprinkle over a few bread crumbs, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg; place
small pieces of butter over, and bake before the fire in a Dutch oven. Put sufficient bread
crumbs on the top to make a smooth surface, as the oysters should not be seen.

Time.--About 1/4 hour.

Average cost, 3s. 2d.

Seasonable from September to April.

STEWED OYSTERS.

288. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of oysters, 1 oz. of butter, flour, 1/3 pint of cream; cayenne and
salt to taste; 1 blade of pounded mace.

Mode.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, take them out, beard them, and strain the liquor;
put the butter into a stewpan, dredge in sufficient flour to dry it up, add the oyster-liquor
and mace, and stir it over a sharp fire with a wooden spoon; when it comes to a boil, add the
cream, oysters, and seasoning. Let all simmer for 1 or 2 minutes, but not longer, or the oysters
would harden. Serve on a hot dish, and garnish with croutons, or toasted sippets of bread.
A small piece of lemon-peel boiled with the oyster-liquor, and taken out before the cream is
added, will be found an improvement.

Time.--Altogether 15 minutes.

Average cost for this quantity, 3s. 6d.

Seasonable from September to April.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

    THE OYSTER AND THE SCALLOP.--The oyster is described as a
    bivalve shell-fish, having the valves generally unequal. The
    hinge is without teeth, but furnished with a somewhat oval
    cavity, and mostly with lateral transverse grooves. From a
    similarity in the structure of the hinge, oysters and scallops
    hare been classified as one tribe; but they differ very
    essentially both in their external appearance and their habits.
    Oysters adhere to rocks, or, as in two or three species, to
    roots of trees on the shore; while the scallops are always
    detached, and usually lurk in the sand.

OYSTER PATTIES (an Entree).

289. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen oysters, 2 oz. butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, a little lemon-juice,
1 blade of pounded mace; cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and cut each one into 3 pieces. Make
the patty-cases as directed for lobster patties, No. 277: fill with the oyster mixture, and
replace the covers.

Time.--2 minutes for the oysters to simmer in the mixture.

Average cost, exclusive of the patty-cases, 1s. 1d.

Seasonable from September to April.

    THE OYSTER FISHERY.--The oyster fishery in Britain is esteemed
    of so much importance, that it is regulated by a Court of
    Admiralty. In the month of May, the fishermen are allowed to
    take the oysters, in order to separate the spawn from the
    cultch, the latter of which is thrown in again, to preserve the
    bed for the future. After this month, it is felony to carry away
    the cultch, and otherwise punishable to take any oyster, between
    the shells of which, when closed, a shilling will rattle.

TO KEEP OYSTERS.

290. Put them in a tub, and cover them with salt and water. Let them remain for 12 hours, when
they are to be taken out, and allowed to stand for another 12 hours without water. If left
without water every alternate 12 hours, they will be much better than if constantly kept in
it. Never put the same water twice to them.

OYSTERS FRIED IN BATTER.

291. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of oysters, 2 eggs, 1/2 pint of milk, sufficient flour to make
the batter; pepper and salt to taste; when liked, a little nutmeg; hot lard.

Mode.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and lay them on a cloth, to drain
thoroughly. Break the eggs into a basin, mix the flour with them, add the milk gradually, with
nutmeg and seasoning, and put the oysters in the batter. Make some lard hot in a deep frying-pan,
put in the oysters, one at a time; when done, take them up with a sharp-pointed skewer, and
dish them on a napkin. Fried oysters are frequently used for garnishing boiled fish, and then
a few bread crumbs should be added to the flour.

Time.--5 or 6 minutes.

Average cost for this quantity, 1s. 10d.

Seasonable from September to April.

Sufficient for 3 persons.

    EXCELLENCE OF THE ENGLISH OYSTER.--The French assert that the
    English oysters, which are esteemed the best in Europe, were
    originally procured from Cancalle Bay, near St. Malo; but they
    assign no proof for this. It is a fact, however, that the
    oysters eaten in ancient Rome were nourished in the channel
    which then parted the Isle of Thanet from England, and which has
    since been filled up, and converted into meadows.

BOILED PERCH.

292. If the fish is very large, longer time must be allowed. Garnish with parsley, and serve
with plain melted butter, or Dutch sauce. Perch do not preserve so good a flavour when stewed
as when dressed in any other way.

Time.--Middling-sized perch, 1/4 hour.

Seasonable from September to November.

Note.--Tench may be boiled the same way, and served with the same sauces.

    THE PERCH.--This is one of the best, as it is one of the most
    common, of our fresh-water fishes, and is found in nearly all
    the lakes and rivers in Britain and Ireland, as well as through
    the whole of Europe within the temperate zone. It is extremely
    voracious, and it has the peculiarity of being gregarious, which
    is contrary to the nature of all fresh-water fishes of prey. The
    best season to angle for it is from the beginning of May to the
    middle of July. Large numbers of this fish are bred in the
    Hampton Court and Bushy Park ponds, all of which are well
    supplied with running water and with plenty of food; yet they
    rarely attain a large size. In the Regent's Park they are also
    very numerous; but are seldom heavier than three quarters of a
    pound.

FRIED PERCH.

293. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs, hot lard.

Mode.--Scale and clean the fish, brush it over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs. Have
ready some boiling lard; put the fish in, and fry a nice brown. Serve with plain melted butter
or anchovy sauce.

Time.--10 minutes.

Seasonable from September to November.

Note.--Fry tench in the same way.

PERCH STEWED WITH WINE.

294. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of stock No. 105 and sherry, 1 bay-leaf, 1 clove of garlic,
a small bunch of parsley, 2 cloves, salt to taste; thickening of butter and flour, pepper,
grated nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce.

Mode.--Scale the fish and take out the gills, and clean them thoroughly; lay them in a stewpan
with sufficient stock and sherry just to cover them. Put in the bay-leaf, garlic, parsley,
cloves, and salt, and simmer till tender. When done, take out the fish, strain the liquor,
add a thickening of butter and flour, the pepper, nutmeg, and the anchovy sauce, and stir it
over the fire until somewhat reduced, when pour over the fish, and serve.

Time.--About 20 minutes.

Seasonable from September to November.

BOILED PIKE.

295. Lay it in cold water, and when it boils, throw in the salt and vinegar. The time for boiling
depends, of course, on the size of the fish; but a middling-sized pike will take about 1/2
an hour. Seldom bought.

Seasonable from September to March.

    THE PIKE.--This fish is, on account of its voracity, termed the
    freshwater shark, and is abundant in most of the European lakes,
    especially those of the northern parts. It grows to an immense
    size, some attaining to the measure of eight feet, in Lapland
    and Russia. The smaller lakes, of this country and Ireland, vary
    in the kinds of fish they produce; some affording trout, others
    pike; and so on. Where these happen to be together, however, the
    trout soon becomes extinct. "Within a short distance of
    Castlebar," says a writer on sports, "there is a small bog-lake
    called Derreens. Ten years ago it was celebrated for its
    numerous well-sized trouts. Accidentally pike effected a passage
    into the lake from the Minola river, and now the trouts are
    extinct, or, at least, none of them are caught or seen. Previous
    to the intrusion of the pikes, half a dozen trouts would be
    killed in an evening in Derreens, whose collective weight often
    amounted to twenty pounds." As an eating fish, the pike is in
    general dry.

BAKED PIKE.

296. INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 pike, a nice delicate stuffing (see Forcemeats), 1 egg, bread crumbs,
1/4 lb. butter.

Mode.--Scale the fish, take out the gills, wash, and wipe it thoroughly dry; stuff it with
forcemeat, sew it up, and fasten the tail in the mouth by means of a skewer; brush it over
with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and baste with butter, before putting it in the oven,
which must be well heated. When the pike is of a nice brown colour, cover it with buttered
paper, as the outside would become too dry. If 2 are dressed, a little variety may be made
by making one of them green with a little chopped parsley mixed with the bread crumbs. Serve
anchovy or Dutch sauce, and plain melted butter with it.

Note.--Pike à la génévese may be stewed in the same manner as salmon à la génévese.

FRIED PLAICE.

297.--INGREDIENTS.--Hot lard, or clarified dripping; egg and bread crumbs.

Mode.--This fish is fried in the same manner as soles. Wash and wipe them thoroughly dry, and
let them remain in a cloth until it is time to dress them. Brush them over with egg, and cover
with bread crumbs mixed with a little flour. Fry of a nice brown in hot dripping or lard, and
garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon. Send them to table with shrimp-sauce and plain melted
butter.

Time.--About 5 minutes. Average cost, 3d. each.

Seasonable from May to November.

Sufficient, 4 plaice for 4 persons.

Note.--Plaice may be boiled plain, and served with melted butter. Garnish with parsley and
cut lemon.

STEWED PLAICE.

298. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 plaice, 2 onions, 1/2 oz. ground ginger, 1 pint of lemon-juice, 1/4
pint water, 6 eggs; cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Cut the fish into pieces about 2 inches wide, salt them, and let them remain 1/4 hour.
Slice and fry the onions a light brown; put them in a stewpan, on the top of which put the
fish without washing, and add the ginger, lemon-juice, and water. Cook slowly for 1/2 hour,
and do not let the fish boil, or it will break. 9d.

Seasonable from May to November.

Sufficient for 4 persons; according to size.

    THE PLAICE.--This fish is found both in the Baltic and the
    Mediterranean, and is also abundant on the coast of England. It
    keeps well, and, like all ground-fish, is very tenacious of
    life. Its flesh is inferior to that of the sole, and, as it is a
    low-priced fish, it is generally bought by the poor. The best
    brought to the London market are called Dowers plaice, from
    their being caught in the Dowers, or flats, between Hastings and
    Folkstone.

TO BOIL PRAWNS OR SHRIMPS.

299. Throw them into boiling water, salted as above, and keep them boiling for about 7 or 8
minutes. Shrimps should be done in the same way; but less time must be allowed. It may easily
be known when they are done by their changing colour. Care should be taken that they are not
over-boiled, as they then become tasteless and indigestible.

Time.--Prawns, about 8 minutes; shrimps, about 5 minutes.

Average cost, prawns, 2s. per lb.; shrimps, 6d. per pint.

Seasonable all the year.

TO DRESS PRAWNS.

300. Cover a dish with a large cup reversed, and over that lay a small white napkin. Arrange
the prawns on it in the form of a pyramid, and garnish with plenty of parsley.

BOILED SALMON.

301. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of salt to each gallon of water,--sufficient water to cover the fish.

Mode.--Scale and clean the fish, and be particular that no blood is left inside; lay it in
the fish-kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it, adding salt in the above proportion.
Bring it quickly to a boil, take off all the scum, and let it simmer gently till the fish is
done, which will be when the meat separates easily from the bone. Experience alone can teach
the cook to fix the time for boiling fish; but it is especially to be remembered, that it should
never be underdressed, as then nothing is more unwholesome. Neither let it remain in the kettle
after it is sufficiently cooked, as that would render it insipid, watery, and colourless. Drain
it, and if not wanted for a few minutes, keep it warm by means of warm cloths laid over it.
A dish of dressed cucumber usually accompanies this fish.

Time.--8 minutes to each lb. for large thick salmon; 6 minutes for thin fish. Average cost,
in full season, 1s. 3d. per lb.

Seasonable from April to August.

Sufficient, 1/2 lb., or rather less, for each person.

Note.--Cut lemon should be put on the table with this fish; and a little of the juice squeezed
over it is considered by many persons a most agreeable addition. Boiled peas are also, by some
connoisseurs, considered especially adapted to be served with salmon.

TO CHOOSE SALMON.--To be good, the belly should be firm and thick, which may readily be ascertained
by feeling it with the thumb and finger. The circumstance of this fish having red gills, though
given as a standing rule in most cookery-books, as a sign of its goodness, is not at all to
be relied on, as this quality can be easily given them by art.

SALMON AND CAPER SAUCE.

302. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of salmon, 1/4 lb. batter, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped parsley,
1 shalot; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste.

Mode.--Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, place pieces of butter over it, and add the other ingredients,
rubbing a little of the seasoning into the fish; baste it frequently; when done, take it out
and drain for a minute or two; lay it in a dish, pour caper sauce over it, and serve. Salmon
dressed in this way, with tomato sauce, is very delicious.

Time.--About 3/4 hour. Average cost, 1s. 3d. per lb.

Seasonable from April to August.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

    THE MIGRATORY HABITS OF THE SALMON.--The instinct with which the
    salmon revisits its native river, is one of the most curious
    circumstances in its natural history. As the swallow returns
    annually to its nest, so it returns to the same spot to deposit
    its ova. This fact would seem to have been repeatedly proved. M.
    De Lande fastened a copper ring round a salmon's tail, and found
    that, for three successive seasons, it returned to the same
    place. Dr. Bloch states that gold and silver rings have been
    attached by eastern princes to salmon, to prove that a
    communication existed between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian
    and Northern Seas, and that the experiment succeeded.

COLLARED SALMON.

303. INGREDIENTS.--A piece of salmon, say 3 lbs., a high seasoning of salt, pounded mace, and
pepper; water and vinegar, 3 bay-leaves.

Mode.--Split the fish; scale, bone, and wash it thoroughly clean; wipe it, and rub in the seasoning
inside and out; roll it up, and bind firmly; lay it in a kettle, cover it with vinegar and
water (1/3 vinegar, in proportion to the water); add the bay-leaves and a good seasoning of
salt and whole pepper, and simmer till done. Do not remove the lid. Serve with melted butter
or anchovy sauce. For preserving the collared fish, boil up the liquor in which it was cooked,
and add a little more vinegar. Pour over when cold.

Time.--3/4 hour, or rather more.

    HABITAT OF THE SALMON.--The salmon is styled by Walton the "king
    of fresh-water fish," and is found distributed over the north of
    Europe and Asia, from Britain to Kamschatka, but is never found
    in warm latitudes, nor has it ever been caught even so far south
    as the Mediterranean. It lives in fresh as well as in salt
    waters, depositing its spawn in the former, hundreds of miles
    from the mouths of some of those rivers to which it has been
    known to resort. In 1859, great efforts were made to introduce
    this fish into the Australian colonies; and it is believed that
    the attempt, after many difficulties, which were very skilfully
    overcome, has been successful.

CRIMPED SALMON.

304. Salmon is frequently dressed in this way at many fashionable tables, but must be very
fresh, and cut into slices 2 or 3 inches thick. Lay these in cold salt and water for 1 hour;
have ready some boiling water, salted, as in recipe No. 301, and well skimmed; put in the fish,
and simmer gently for 1/4 hour, or rather more; should it be very thick, garnish the same as
boiled salmon, and serve with the same sauces.

Time.--1/4 hour, more or less, according to size.

Note.--Never use vinegar with salmon, as it spoils the taste and colour of the fish.

    THE SALMON TRIBE.--This is the Abdominal fish, forming the
    fourth of the orders of Linnaeus. They are distinguished from
    the other fishes by having two dorsal fins, of which the
    hindmost is fleshy and without rays. They have teeth both on the
    tongue and in the jaws, whilst the body is covered with round
    and minutely striated scales.

CURRIED SALMON.

305. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of boiled salmon, 3/4 pint of strong or medium stock (No. 105),
1 onion, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of
anchovy sauce, 1 oz. of butter, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste.

Mode.--Cut up the onions into small pieces, and fry them of a pale brown in the butter; add
all the ingredients but the salmon, and simmer gently till the onion is tender, occasionally
stirring the contents; cut the salmon into small square pieces, carefully take away all skin
and bone, lay it in the stewpan, and let it gradually heat through; but do not allow it to
boil long.

Time.--3/4 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the cold fish, 9d.

    GROWTH OF THE SALMON.--At the latter end of the year--some as
    soon as November--salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as
    they can reach, in order to deposit their spawn, which they do
    in the sand or gravel, about eighteen inches deep. Here it lies
    buried till the spring, when, about the latter end of March, it
    begins to exclude the young, which gradually increase to four or
    five inches in length, and are then termed smelts or smouts.
    About the beginning of May, the river seems to be alive with
    them, and there is no forming an idea of their numbers without
    having seen them. A seasonable flood, however, comes, and
    hurries them to the "great deep;" whence, about the middle of
    June, they commence their return to the river again. By this
    time they are twelve or sixteen inches long, and progressively
    increase, both in number and size, till about the end of July,
    when they have become large enough to be denominated grilse.
    Early in August they become fewer in numbers, but of greater
    size, haying advanced to a weight of from six to nine pounds.
    This rapidity of growth appears surprising, and realizes the
    remark of Walton, that "the salmlet becomes a salmon in as short
    a time as a gosling becomes a goose." Recent writers have,
    however, thrown considerable doubts on this quick growth of the
    salmon.

SALMON CUTLETS.

306. Cut the slices 1 inch thick, and season them with pepper and salt; butter a sheet of white
paper, lay each slice on a separate piece, with their ends twisted; broil gently over a clear
fire, and serve with anchovy or caper sauce. When higher seasoning is required, add a few chopped
herbs and a little spice.

Time.--5 to 10 minutes.

SALMON A LA GENEVESE.

307. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of salmon, 2 chopped shalots, a little parsley, a small bunch of
herbs, 2 bay-leaves, 2 carrots, pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of
Madeira, 1/2 pint of white stock (No. 107), thickening of butter and flour, 1 teaspoonful of
essence of anchovies, the juice of 1 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste.

Mode.--Rub the bottom of a stewpan over with butter, and put in the shalots, herbs, bay-leaves,
carrots, mace, and seasoning; stir them for 10 minutes over a clear fire, and add the Madeira
or sherry; simmer gently for 1/2 hour, and strain through a sieve over the fish, which stew
in this gravy. As soon as the fish is sufficiently cooked, take away all the liquor, except
a little to keep the salmon moist, and put it into another stewpan; add the stock, thicken
with butter and flour, and put in the anchovies, lemon-juice, cayenne, and salt; lay the salmon
on a hot dish, pour over it part of the sauce, and serve the remainder in a tureen.

PICKLED SALMON.

308. INGREDIENTS.--Salmon, 1/2 oz. of whole pepper, 1/2 oz. of whole allspice, 1 teaspoonful
of salt, 2 bay-leaves, equal quantities of vinegar and the liquor in which the fish was boiled.

Mode.--After the fish comes from table, lay it in a nice dish with a cover to it, as it should
be excluded from the air, and take away the bone; boil the liquor and vinegar with the other
ingredients for 10 minutes, and let it stand to get cold; pour it over the salmon, and in 12
hours this will be fit for the table.

Time.--10 minutes.

    TO CURE SALMON.--This process consists in splitting the fish,
    rubbing it with salt, and then putting it into pickle in tubs
    provided for the purpose. Here it is kept for about six weeks,
    when it is taken out, pressed and packed in casks, with layers
    of salt.

POTTED SALMON.

309. INGREDIENTS.--Salmon; pounded mace, cloves, and pepper to taste; 3 bay-leaves, 1/4 lb. butter.

Mode.--Skin the salmon, and clean it thoroughly by wiping with a cloth (water would spoil it);
cut it into square pieces, which rub with salt; let them remain till thoroughly drained, then
lay them in a dish with the other ingredients, and bake. When quite done, drain them from the
gravy, press into pots for use, and, when cold, pour over it clarified butter.

Time.--1/2 hour.

    AN AVERSION IN THE SALMON.--The salmon is said to have an
    aversion to anything red; hence, fishermen engaged in catching
    it do not wear jackets or caps of that colour. Pontoppidan also
    says, that it has an abhorrence of carrion, and if any happens
    to be thrown into the places it haunts, it immediately forsakes
    them. The remedy adopted for this in Norway, is to throw into
    the polluted water a lighted torch. As food, salmon, when in
    perfection, is one of the most delicious and nutritive of our
    fish.

BAKED SEA-BREAM.

310. INGREDIENTS.--1 bream. Seasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and cayenne; 1/4 lb. of butter.

Mode.--Well wash the bream, but do not remove the scales, and wipe away all moisture with a
nice dry cloth. Season it inside and out with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and lay it in a baking-dish.
Place the butter, in small pieces, upon the fish, and bake for rather more than 1/2 an hour.
To stuff this fish before baking, will be found a great improvement.

Time.--Rather more than 1/2 an hour.

Seasonable in summer.

Note.--This fish may be broiled over a nice clear fire, and served with a good brown gravy
or white sauce, or it may be stewed in wine.

    THE SEA-BREAM.--This is an abundant fish in Cornwall, and it is
    frequently found in the fish-market of Hastings during the
    summer months, but it is not in much esteem.

    MR. YARRELL'S RECIPE.

    "When thoroughly cleansed, the fish should be wiped dry, but
    none of the scales should be taken off. In this state it should
    be broiled, turning it often, and if the skin cracks, flour it a
    little to keep the outer case entire. When on table, the whole
    skin and scales turn off without difficulty, and the muscle
    beneath, saturated in its own natural juices, which the outside
    covering has retained, will be of good flavour."

TO DRESS SHAD.

311. INGREDIENTS.--1 shad, oil, pepper, and salt.

Mode.--Scale, empty and wash the fish carefully, and make two or three incisions across the
back. Season it with pepper and salt, and let it remain in oil for 1/2 hour. Broil it on both
sides over a clear fire, and serve with caper sauce. This fish is much esteemed by the French,
and by them is considered excellent.

Time.--Nearly 1 hour.

Average cost.--Seldom bought.

Seasonable from April to June.

    THE SHAD.--This is a salt-water fish, but is held in little
    esteem. It enters our rivers to spawn in May, and great numbers
    of them are taken opposite the Isle of Dogs, in the Thames.

POTTED SHRIMPS.

312. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of shelled shrimps, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 1 blade of pounded mace,
cayenne to taste; when liked, a little nutmeg.

Mode.--Have ready a pint of picked shrimps, and put them, with the other ingredients, into
a stewpan; let them heat gradually in the butter, but do not let it boil. Pour into small pots,
and when cold, cover with melted butter, and carefully exclude the air.

Time.--1/4 hour to soak in the butter.

Average cost for this quantity, 1s. 3d.

BUTTERED PRAWNS OR SHRIMPS.

313. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of picked prawns or shrimps, 3/4 pint of stock No. 104, thickening
of butter and flour; salt, cayenne, and nutmeg to taste.

Mode.--Pick the prawns or shrimps, and put them in a stewpan with the stock; add a thickening
of butter and flour; season, and simmer gently for 3 minutes. Serve on a dish garnished with
fried bread or toasted sippets. Cream sauce may be substituted for the gravy.

Time.--3 minutes.

Average cost for this quantity, 1s. 4d.

    THE SHRIMP.--This shell-fish is smaller than the prawn, and is
    greatly relished in London as a delicacy. It inhabits most of
    the sandy shores of Europe, and the Isle of Wight is especially
    famous for them.

BOILED SKATE.

314. Let it simmer very gently till done; then dish it on a hot napkin, and serve with shrimp,
lobster, or caper sauce.

Seasonable from August to April.

CRIMPED SKATE.

315. INGREDIENTS.--1/8 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.

Mode.--Clean, skin, and cut the fish into slices, which roll and tie round with string. Have
ready some water highly salted, put in the fish, and boil till it is done. Drain well, remove
the string, dish on a hot napkin, and serve with the same sauces as above. Skate should never
be eaten out of season, as it is liable to produce diarrhoea and other diseases. It may be
dished without a napkin, and the sauce poured over.

Time.--About 20 minutes. Average cost, 4d. per lb.

Seasonable from August to April.

TO CHOOSE SKATE.--This fish should be chosen for its firmness, breadth, and thickness, and
should have a creamy appearance. When crimped, it should not be kept longer than a day or two,
as all kinds of crimped fish soon become sour.

    THE SKATE.--This is one of the ray tribe, and is extremely
    abundant and cheap in the fishing towns of England. The flesh is
    white, thick, and nourishing; but, we suppose, from its being so
    plentiful, it is esteemed less than it ought to be on account of
    its nutritive properties, and the ease with which it is
    digested. It is much improved by crimping; in which state it is
    usually sold in London. The THORNBACK differs from the true
    skate by having large spines in its back, of which the other is
    destitute. It is taken in great abundance during the spring and
    summer months, but its flesh is not so good as it is in
    November. It is, in regard to quality, inferior to that of the
    true skate.

SKATE WITH CAPER SAUCE (a la Francaise)

316.

Mode.--Put in a fish-kettle all the above ingredients, and simmer the skate in them till tender.
When it is done, skin it neatly, and pour over it some of the liquor in which it has been boiling.
Drain it, put it on a hot dish, pour over it caper sauce, and send some of the latter to table
in a tureen.

Note.--Skate may also be served with onion sauce, or parsley and butter.

SMALL SKATE FRIED.

317. INGREDIENTS.--Skate, sufficient vinegar to cover them, salt and pepper to taste, 1 sliced
onion, a small bunch of parsley, the juice of 1/2 lemon, hot dripping.

Mode.--Cleanse the skate, lay them in a dish, with sufficient vinegar to cover them; add the
salt, pepper, onion, parsley, and lemon-juice, and let the fish remain in this pickle for 1-1/2
hour. Then drain them well, flour them, and fry of a nice brown, in hot dripping. They may
be served either with or without sauce. Skate is not good if dressed too fresh, unless it is
crimped; it should, therefore, be kept for a day, but not long enough to produce a disagreeable
smell.

    OTHER SPECIES OF SKATE.--Besides the true skate, there are
    several other species found in our seas. These are known as the
    white skate, the long-nosed skate, and the Homelyn ray, which
    are of inferior quality, though often crimped, and sold for true
    skate.

TO BAKE SMELTS.

318. INGREDIENTS.--12 smelts, bread crumbs, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 2 blades of pounded mace;
salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Wash, and dry the fish thoroughly in a cloth, and arrange them nicely in a flat baking-dish.
Cover them with fine bread crumbs, and place little pieces of butter all over them. Season
and bake for 15 minutes. Just before serving, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and garnish with
fried parsley and cut lemon.

Time.--1/4 hour. Average cost, 2s. per dozen.

Seasonable from October to May.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

TO CHOOSE SMELTS.--When good, this fish is of a fine silvery appearance, and when alive, their
backs are of a dark brown shade, which, after death, fades to a light fawn. They ought to have
a refreshing fragrance, resembling that of a cucumber.

    THE ODOUR OF THE SMELT.--This peculiarity in the smelt has been
    compared, by some, to the fragrance of a cucumber, and by
    others, to that of a violet. It is a very elegant fish, and
    formerly abounded in the Thames. The Atharine, or sand smelt,
    is sometimes sold for the true one; but it is an inferior fish,
    being drier in the quality of its flesh. On the south coast of
    England, where the true smelt is rare, it is plentiful.

TO FRY SMELTS.

319. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs, a little flour; boiling lard.

Mode.--Smelts should be very fresh, and not washed more than is necessary to clean them. Dry
them in a cloth, lightly flour, dip them in egg, and sprinkle over with very fine bread crumbs,
and put them into boiling lard. Fry of a nice pale brown, and be careful not to take off the
light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be spoiled. Dry them before the fire on
a drainer, and servo with plain melted butter. This fish is often used as a garnishing.

Time.--5 minutes.

Average cost, 2s. per dozen.

Seasonable from October to May.

    THE SMELT.--This is a delicate little fish, and is in high
    esteem. Mr. Yarrell asserts that the true smelt is entirety
    confined to the western and eastern coasts of Britain. It very
    rarely ventures far from the shore, and is plentiful in
    November, December, and January.

BAKED SOLES.

320. INGREDIENTS.--2 soles, 1/4 lb. of butter, egg, and bread crumbs, minced parsley, 1 glass
of sherry, lemon-juice; cayenne and salt to taste.

Mode.--Clean, skin, and well wash the fish, and dry them thoroughly in a cloth. Brush them
over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley, lay them in a
large flat baking-dish, white side uppermost; or if it will not hold the two soles, they may
each be laid on a dish by itself; but they must not be put one on the top of the other. Melt
the butter, and pour it over the whole, and bake for 20 minutes. Take a portion of the gravy
that flows from the fish, add the wine, lemon-juice, and seasoning, give it one boil, skim,
pour it under the fish, and serve.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost, 1s. to 2s. per pair.

Seasonable at any time.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

TO CHOOSE SOLES.--This fish should be both thick and firm. If the skin is difficult to be taken
off, and the flesh looks grey, it is good.

    THE SOLE.--This ranks next to the turbot in point of excellence
    among our flat fish. It is abundant on the British coasts, but
    those of the western shores are much superior in size to those
    taken on the northern. The finest are caught in Torbay, and
    frequently weigh 8 or 10 lbs. per pair. Its flesh being firm,
    white, and delicate, is greatly esteemed.

BOILED SOLES.

321. Lay it in a fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover it, salted in the above proportion.
Let it gradually come to a boil, and keep it simmering for a few minutes, according to the
size of the fish. Dish it on a hot napkin after well draining it, and garnish with parsley
and cut lemon. Shrimp, or lobster sauce, and plain melted butter, are usually sent to table
with this dish.

Time.--After the water boils, 7 minutes for a middling-sized sole.

SOLE OR COD PIE.

322. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold boiled sole or cod, seasoning to taste of pepper, salt,
and pounded mace, 1 dozen oysters to each lb. of fish, 3 tablespoonfuls of white stock, 1 teacupful
of cream thickened with flour, puff paste.

Mode.--Clear the fish from the bones, lay it in a pie-dish, and between each layer put a few
oysters and a little seasoning; add the stock, and, when liked, a small quantity of butter;
cover with puff paste, and bake for 1/2 hour. Boil the cream with sufficient flour to thicken
it; pour in the pie, and serve.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost for this quantity, 10d.

Seasonable at any time.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

SOLES WITH CREAM SAUCE.

323. INGREDIENTS.--2 soles; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste; the juice of 1/2 lemon,
salt and water, 1/2 pint of cream.

Mode.--Skin, wash, and fillet the soles, and divide each fillet in 2 pieces; lay them in cold
salt and water, which bring gradually to a boil. When the water boils, take out the fish, lay
it in a delicately clean stewpan, and cover with the cream. Add the seasoning, simmer very
gently for ten minutes, and, just before serving, put in the lemon-juice. The fillets may be
rolled, and secured by means of a skewer; but this is not so economical a way of dressing them,
as double the quantity of cream is required.

Time.--10 minutes in the cream.

This will be found a most delicate and delicious dish.

    THE SOLE A FAVOURITE WITH THE ANCIENT GREEKS.--This fish was
    much sought after by the ancient Greeks on account of its light
    and nourishing qualities. The brill, the flounder, the diamond
    and Dutch plaice, which, with the sole, were known under the
    general name of passeres, were all equally esteemed, and had
    generally the same qualities attributed to them.

FILLETED SOLES A L'ITALIENNE.

324. INGREDIENTS.--2 soles; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste; egg and bread crumbs,
butter, the juice of 1 lemon.

Mode.--Skin, and carefully wash the soles, separate the meat from the bone, and divide each
fillet in two pieces. Brush them over with white of egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and seasoning,
and put them in a baking-dish. Place small pieces of butter over the whole, and bake for 1/2
hour. When they are nearly done, squeeze the juice of a lemon over them, and serve on a dish,
with Italian sauce (see Sauces) poured over.

Time.--1/2 hour.

WHITING may be dressed in the same manner, and will be found very delicious.

    THE FLAVOUR OF THE SOLE.--This, as a matter of course, greatly
    depends on the nature of the ground and bait upon which the
    animal feeds. Its natural food are small crabs and shell-fish.
    Its colour also depends on the colour of the ground where it
    feeds; for if this be white, then the sole is called the white,
    or lemon sole; but if the bottom be muddy, then it is called the
    black sole. Small-sized soles, caught in shallow water on the
    coasts, are the best in flavour.

FRICASSEED SOLES.

325. INGREDIENTS.--2 middling-sized soles, 1 small one, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped lemon-peel,
1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a little grated bread; salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste;
1 egg, 2 oz. butter, 1/2 pint of good gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine, cayenne and lemon-juice
to taste.

Mode.--Fry the soles of a nice brown, as directed in recipe No. 327, and drain them well from
fat. Take all the meat from the small sole, chop it fine, and mix with it the lemon-peel, parsley,
bread, and seasoning; work altogether, with the yolk of an egg and the butter; make this into
small balls, and fry them. Thicken the gravy with a dessert-spoonful of flour, add the port
wine, cayenne, and lemon-juice; lay in the 2 soles and balls; let them simmer gently for 6
minutes; serve hot, and garnish with cut lemon.

Time.--10 minutes to fry the soles.

Average cost for this quantity, 3s.

Seasonable at any time. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

    HOW SOLES ARE CAUGHT.--The instrument usually employed is a
    trawl net, which is shaped like a pocket, of from sixty to
    eighty feet long, and open at the mouth from thirty-two to forty
    feet, and three deep. This is dragged along the ground by the
    vessel, and on the art of the fisherman in its employment, in a
    great measure depends the quality of the fish he catches. If,
    for example, he drags the net too quickly, all that are caught
    are swept rapidly to the end of the net, where they are
    smothered, and sometimes destroyed. A medium has to be observed,
    in order that as few as possible escape being caught in the net,
    and as many as possible preserved alive in it.

FRIED FILLETED SOLES.

326. Soles for filleting should be large, as the flesh can be more easily separated from the
bones, and there is less waste. Skin and wash the fish, and raise the meat carefully from the
bones, and divide it into nice handsome pieces. The more usual way is to roll the fillets,
after dividing each one in two pieces, and either bind them round with twine, or run a small
skewer through them. Brush over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs; fry them as directed
in the foregoing recipe, and garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon. When a pretty dish is
desired, this is by far the most elegant mode of dressing soles, as they look much better than
when fried whole. (See Coloured Plate A.) Instead of rolling the fillets, they may be cut into
square pieces, and arranged in the shape of a pyramid on the dish.

FRIED SOLES.

327. Have ready some fine bread crumbs and beaten egg; dredge the soles with a little flour,
brush them over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs. Put them in a deep pan, with plenty
of clarified dripping or lard (when the expense is not objected to, oil is still better) heated,
so that it may neither scorch the fish nor make them sodden. When they are sufficiently cooked
on one side, turn them carefully, and brown them on the other: they may be considered ready
when a thick smoke rises. Lift them out carefully, and lay them before the fire on a reversed
sieve and soft paper, to absorb the fat. Particular attention should be paid to this, as nothing
is more disagreeable than greasy fish: this may be always avoided by dressing them in good
time, and allowing a few minutes for them to get thoroughly crisp, and free from greasy moisture.

SOLES WITH MUSHROOMS.

328. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 oz. butter, 1 oz. salt, a little lemon-juice,
2 middling-sized soles.

Mode.--Cleanse the soles, but do not skin them, and lay them in a fish-kettle, with the milk,
water, butter, salt, and lemon-juice. Bring them gradually to boil, and let them simmer very
gently till done, which will be in about 7 minutes. Take them up, drain them well on a cloth,
put them on a hot dish, and pour over them a good mushroom sauce. (See Sauces.)

Time.--After the water boils, 7 minutes.

Seasonable at any time.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

SPRATS.

329. Sprats should be cooked very fresh, which can be ascertained by their bright and sparkling
eyes. Wipe them dry; fasten them in rows by a skewer run through the eyes; dredge with flour,
and broil them on a gridiron over a nice clear fire. The gridiron should be rubbed with suet.
Serve very hot.

Time,--3 or 4 minutes. Average cost, 1d. per lb.

Seasonable from November to March.

TO CHOOSE SPRATS.--Choose these from their silvery appearance, as the brighter they are, so
are they the fresher.

SPRATS FRIED IN BATTER.

330. INGREDIENTS.--2 eggs, flour, bread crumbs; seasoning of salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Wipe the sprats, and dip them in a batter made of the above ingredients. Fry of a nice
brown, serve very hot, and garnish with fried parsley.

Sprats may be baked like herrings. (See No. 268.)

DRIED SPRATS.

331. Dried sprats should be put into a basin, and boiling water poured over them; they may
then be skinned and served, and this will be found a much better way than boiling them.

    THE SPRAT.--This migratory fish, is rarely found longer than
    four or five inches, and visits the shores of Britain after the
    herring and other kinds of fish have taken their departure from
    them. On the coasts of Suffolk, Essex, and Kent, they are very
    abundant, and from 400 to 500 boats are employed in catching
    them during the winter season. Besides plentifully supplying the
    London market, they are frequently sold at sixpence a bushel to
    farmers for manuring purposes. They enter the Thames about the
    beginning of November, and leave it in March. At Yarmouth and
    Gravesend they are cured like red herrings.

BAKED STURGEON.

332. INGREDIENTS.--1 small sturgeon, salt and pepper to taste, 1 small bunch of herbs, the
juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1 pint of white wine.

Mode,--Cleanse the fish thoroughly, skin it, and split it along the belly without separating
it; have ready a large baking-dish, in which lay the fish, sprinkle over the seasoning and
herbs very finely minced, and moisten it with the lemon-juice and wine. Place the butter in
small pieces over the whole of the fish, put it in the oven, and baste frequently; brown it
nicely, and serve with its own gravy.

Time.--Nearly 1 hour. Average cost, 1s. to 1s. 6d. per lb.

Seasonable from August to March.

    THE STURGEON.--This fish commences the sixth of Linnaean order,
    and all the species are large, seldom measuring, when
    full-grown, less than three or four feet in length. Its flesh is
    reckoned extremely delicious, and, in the time of the emperor
    Severus, was so highly valued by the ancients, that it was
    brought to table by servants crowned with coronets, and preceded
    by a band of music. It is an inhabitant of the Baltic, the
    Mediterranean, the Caspian, and the Black Sea, and of the
    Danube, the Volga, the Don, and other large rivers. It is
    abundant in the rivers of North America, and is occasionally
    taken in the Thames, as well as in the Eske and the Eden. It is
    one of those fishes considered as royal property. It is from its
    roe that caviare, a favourite food of the Russians, is
    prepared. Its flesh is delicate, firm, and white, but is rare in
    the London market, where it sells for 1s. or 1s. 6d. per lb.

    THE STERLET is a smaller species of sturgeon, found in the
    Caspian Sea and some Russian rivers. It also is greatly prized
    on account of the delicacy of its flesh.

ROAST STURGEON.

333. INGREDIENTS.--Veal stuffing, buttered paper, the tail-end of a sturgeon.

Mode.--Cleanse the fish, bone and skin it; make a nice veal stuffing (see Forcemeats), and
fill it with the part where the bones came from; roll it in buttered paper, bind it up firmly
with tape, like a fillet of veal, and roast it in a Dutch oven before a clear fire. Serve with
good brown gravy, or plain melted butter.

Note.--Sturgeon may be plain-boiled, and served with Dutch sauce. The fish is very firm, and
requires long boiling.

    ESTIMATE OF THE STURGEON BY THE ANCIENTS.--By the ancients, the
    flesh of this fish was compared to the ambrosia of the
    immortals. The poet Martial passes a high eulogium upon it, and
    assigns it a place on the luxurious tables of the Palatine
    Mount. If we may credit a modern traveller in China, the people
    of that country generally entirely abstain from it, and the
    sovereign of the Celestial Empire confines it to his own
    kitchen, or dispenses it to only a few of his greatest
    favourites.

MATELOT OF TENCH.

334.

Mode.--Scale and clean the tench, cut them into pieces, and lay them in a stewpan; add the
stock, wine, onions, mushrooms, herbs, and mace, and simmer gently for 1/2 hour. Put into another
stewpan all the remaining ingredients but the oysters and lemon-juice, and boil slowly for
10 minutes, when add the strained liquor from the tench, and keep stirring it over the fire
until somewhat reduced. Rub it through a sieve, pour it over the tench with the oysters, which
must be previously scalded in their own liquor, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve. Garnish
with croutons.

Time. 3/4 hour.

Seasonable from October to June.

    THE TENCH.--This fish is generally found in foul and weedy
    waters, and in such places as are well supplied with rushes.
    They thrive best in standing waters, and are more numerous in
    pools and ponds than in rivers. Those taken in the latter,
    however, are preferable for the table. It does not often exceed
    four or five pounds in weight, and is in England esteemed as a
    delicious and wholesome food. As, however, they are sometimes
    found in waters where the mud is excessively fetid, their
    flavour, if cooked immediately on being caught, is often very
    unpleasant; but if they are transferred into clear water, they
    soon recover from the obnoxious taint.

TENCH STEWED WITH WINE.

335.

Mode.--Clean and crimp the tench; carefully lay it in a stewpan with the stock, wine, salt
and pepper, and bay-leaf; let it stew gently for 1/2 hour; then take it out, put it on a dish,
and keep hot. Strain the liquor, and thicken it with butter and flour kneaded together, and
stew for 5 minutes. If not perfectly smooth, squeeze it through a tammy, add a very little
cayenne, and pour over the fish. Garnish with balls of veal forcemeat.

Time.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.

Seasonable from October to June.

    A SINGULAR QUALITY IN THE TENCH.--It is said that the tench is
    possessed of such healing properties among the finny tribes,
    that even the voracious pike spares it on this account.

      The pike, fell tyrant of the liquid plain,
      With ravenous waste devours his fellow train;
      Yet howsoe'er with raging famine pined,
      The tench he spares, a medicinal kind;
      For when by wounds distress'd, or sore disease,
      He courts the salutary fish for ease;
      Close to his scales the kind physician glides,
      And sweats a healing balsam from his sides.

    In our estimation, however, this self-denial in the pike may be
    attributed to a less poetical cause; namely, from the mud-loving
    disposition of the tench, it is enabled to keep itself so
    completely concealed at the bottom of its aqueous haunts, that
    it remains secure from the attacks of its predatory neighbour.

STEWED TROUT.

336. INGREDIENTS.--2 middling-sized trout, 1/2 onion cut in thin slices, a little parsley,
2 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 bay-leaves, a little thyme, salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of
medium stock No. 105, 1 glass of port wine, thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Wash the fish very clean, and wipe it quite dry. Lay it in a stewpan, with all the ingredients
but the butter and flour, and simmer gently for 1/2 hour, or rather more, should not the fish
be quite done. Take it out, strain the gravy, add the thickening, and stir it over a sharp
fire for 5 minutes; pour it over the trout, and serve.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Trout may be served with anchovy or caper sauce, baked in buttered paper, or fried whole like
smelts. Trout dressed a la Génévese is extremely delicate; for this proceed the same as with
salmon, No. 307.

    THE TROUT.--This fish, though esteemed by the moderns for its
    delicacy, was little regarded by the ancients. Although it
    abounded in the lakes of the Roman empire, it is generally
    mentioned by writers only on account of the beauty of its
    colours. About the end of September, they quit the deep water to
    which they had retired during the hot weather, for the purpose
    of spawning. This they always do on a gravelly bottom, or where
    gravel and sand are mixed among stones, towards the end or by
    the sides of streams. At this period they become black about the
    head and body, and become soft and unwholesome. They are never
    good when they are large with roe; but there are in all trout
    rivers some barren female fish, which continue good throughout
    the winter. In the common trout, the stomach is uncommonly
    strong and muscular, shell-fish forming a portion of the food of
    the animal; and it takes into its stomach gravel or small stones
    in order to assist in comminuting it.

BOILED TURBOT.

337. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of salt to each gallon of water.

Mode--Choose a middling-sized turbot; for they are invariably the most valuable: if very large,
the meat will be tough and thready. Three or four hours before dressing, soak the fish in salt
and water to take off the slime; then thoroughly cleanse it, and with a knife make an incision
down the middle of the back, to prevent the skin of the belly from cracking. Rub it over with
lemon, and be particular not to cut off the fins. Lay the fish in a very clean turbot-kettle,
with sufficient cold water to cover it, and salt in the above proportion. Let it gradually
come to a boil, and skim very carefully; keep it gently simmering, and on no account let it
boil fast, as the fish would have a very unsightly appearance. When the meat separates easily
from the bone, it is done; then take it out, let it drain well, and dish it on a hot napkin.
Rub a little lobster spawn through a sieve, sprinkle it over the fish, and garnish with tufts
of parsley and cut lemon. Lobster or shrimp sauce, and plain melted butter, should be sent
to table with it. (See Coloured Plate E.)

Time.--After the water boils, about 1/2 hour for a large turbot; middling size, about 20 minutes.

Average cost,--large turbot, from 10s. to 12s.; middling size, from 12s. to 15s.

Seasonable at any time.

Sufficient, 1 middling-sized turbot for 8 persons.

Note.--An amusing anecdote is related, by Miss Edgeworth, of a bishop, who, descending to his
kitchen to superintend the dressing of a turbot, and discovering that his cook had stupidly
cut off the fins, immediately commenced sewing them on again with his own episcopal fingers.
This dignitary knew the value of a turbot's gelatinous appendages.

GARNISH FOR TURBOT OR OTHER LARGE FISH.

338. Take the crumb of a stale loaf, cut it into small pyramids with flat tops, and on the
top of each pyramid, put rather more than a tablespoonful of white of egg beaten to a stiff
froth. Over this, sprinkle finely-chopped parsley and fine raspings of a dark colour. Arrange
these on the napkin round the fish, one green and one brown alternately.

TO CHOOSE TURBOT.--See that it is thick, and of a yellowish white; for if of a bluish tint,
it is not good.

    THE TURBOT.--This is the most esteemed of all our flat fish. The
    northern parts of the English coast, and some places off the
    coast of Holland, produce turbot in great abundance, and in
    greater excellence than any other parts of the world. The London
    market is chiefly supplied by Dutch fishermen, who bring to it
    nearly 90,000 a year. The flesh is firm, white, rich, and
    gelatinous, and is the better for being kept a day or two
    previous to cooking it. In many parts of the country, turbot and
    halibut are indiscriminately sold for each other. They are,
    however, perfectly distinct; the upper parts of the former being
    marked with large, unequal, and obtuse tubercles, while those of
    the other are quite smooth, and covered with oblong soft scales,
    which firmly adhere to the body.

    FISH-KETTLES are made in an oblong form, and have two handles,
    with a movable bottom, pierced full of holes, on which the fish
    is laid, and on which it may be lifted from the water, by means
    of two long handles attached to each side of the movable bottom.
    This is to prevent the liability of breaking the fish, as it
    would necessarily be if it were cooked in a common saucepan. In
    the list of Messrs. Richard and John Slack (see 71), the price
    of two of these is set down at 10s. The turbot-kettle, as will
    be seen by our cut, is made differently from ordinary
    fish-kettles, it being less deep, whilst it is wider, and more
    pointed at the sides; thus exactly answering to the shape of the
    fish which it is intended should be boiled in it. It may be
    obtained from the same manufacturers, and its price is £1.

BAKED FILLETS OF TURBOT.

339. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot, lobster sauce left from the preceding day, egg,
and bread crumbs; cayenne and salt to taste; minced parsley, nutmeg, lemon-juice. Lay the fillets
in a baking-dish, with sufficient butter to baste with. Bake for 1/4 hour, and do not forget
to keep them well moistened with the butter. Put a little lemon-juice and grated nutmeg to
the cold lobster sauce; make it hot, and pour over the fish, which must be well drained from
the butter. Garnish with parsley and cut lemon.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Cold turbot thus warmed in the remains of lobster sauce will be found much nicer than
putting the fish again in water.

FILLETS OF TURBOT A L'ITALIENNE.

340. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot, Italian sauce. (See Sauces.)

Mode.--Clear the fish carefully from the bone, and take away all skin, which gives an unpleasant
flavour to the sauce. Make the sauce hot, lay in the fish to warm through, but do not let it
boil. Garnish with croutons.

Time.--5 minutes.

Seasonable all the year.

    THE ANCIENT ROMANS' ESTIMATE OF TURBOT.--As this luxurious
    people compared soles to partridges, and sturgeons to peacocks,
    so they found a resemblance to the turbot in the pheasant. In
    the time of Domitian, it is said one was taken of such
    dimensions as to require, in the imperial kitchen, a new stove
    to be erected, and a new dish to be made for it, in order that
    it might be cooked and served whole: not even imperial Rome
    could furnish a stove or a dish large enough for the monstrous
    animal. Where it was caught, we are not aware; but the turbot of
    the Adriatic Sea held a high rank in the "Eternal City."

TURBOT A LA CREME.

341. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot. For sauce, 2 oz. of butter, 4 tablespoonfuls
of cream; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste.

Mode.--Clear away all skin and bone from the flesh of the turbot, which should be done when
it comes from table, as it causes less waste when trimmed hot. Cut the flesh into nice square
pieces, as equally as possible; put into a stewpan the butter, let it melt, and add the cream
and seasoning; let it just simmer for one minute, but not boil. Lay in the fish to warm, and
serve it garnished with croutons or a paste border.

Time.--10 minutes.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The remains of cold salmon may be dressed in this way, and the above mixture may be
served in a vol-au-vent.

TURBOT AU GRATIN.

342. INGREDIENTS.--Remains of cold turbot, béchamel (see Sauces), bread crumbs, butter.

Mode.--Cut the flesh of the turbot into small dice, carefully freeing it from all skin and
bone. Put them into a stewpan, and moisten with 4 or 5 tablespoonfuls of béchamel. Let it get
thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to boil. Spread the mixture on a dish, cover with finely-grated
bread crumbs, and place small pieces of butter over the top. Brown it in the oven, or with
a salamander.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. Seasonable at any time.

BOILED WHITING.

343. Bring them gradually to a boil, and simmer gently for about 5 minutes, or rather more
should the fish be very large. Dish them on a hot napkin, and garnish with tufts of parsley.

Seasonable all the year, but best from October to March.

Sufficient, 1 small whiting for each person.

To CHOOSE WHITING.--Choose for the firmness of its flesh and the silvery hue of its appearance.

    The Whiting.--This fish forms a light, tender, and delicate
    food, easy of digestion. It appears in our seas in the spring,
    within three miles of the shores, where it arrives in large
    shoals to deposit its spawn. It is caught by line, and is
    usually between ten and twelve inches long, and seldom exceeding
    a pound and a half in weight. On the edge of the Dogger Bank,
    however, it has been caught so heavy as to weigh from three to
    seven or eight pounds. When less than six inches long, it is not
    allowed to be caught.

BROILED WHITING.

344. INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water, flour.

Mode.--Wash the whiting in salt and water, wipe them thoroughly, and let them remain in the
cloth to absorb all moisture. Flour them well, and broil over a very clear fire. Serve with
maître d'hôtel sauce, or plain melted butter (see Sauces). Be careful to preserve the liver,
as by some it is considered very delicate.

Time.--5 minutes for a small whiting.

Buckhorn.--Whitings caught in Cornwall are salted and dried, and in winter taken to the markets,
and sold under the singular name of "Buckhorn."

FRIED WHITING.

345. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs, a little flour, hot lard or clarified dripping.

Mode.--Take off the skin, clean, and thoroughly wipe the fish free from all moisture, as this
is most essential, in order that the egg and bread crumbs may properly adhere. Fasten the tail
in the mouth by means of a small skewer, brush the fish over with egg, dredge with a little
flour, and cover with bread crumbs. Fry them in hot lard or clarified dripping of a nice colour,
and serve them on a napkin, garnished with fried parsley.

Note.--Large whitings may be filleted, rolled, and served as fried filleted soles (see Coloured
Plato A). Small fried whitings are frequently used for garnishing large boiled fish, such as
turbot, cod, etc.

WHITING AU GRATIN, or BAKED WHITING.

346. INGREDIENTS.--4 whiting, butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, a few chopped mushrooms
when obtainable; pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg to taste; butter, 2 glasses of sherry or Madeira,
bread crumbs.

Mode.--Grease the bottom of a baking-dish with butter, and over it, strew some minced parsley
and mushrooms. Scale, empty, and wash the whitings, and wipe them thoroughly dry, carefully
preserving the livers. Lay them in the dish, sprinkle them with bread crumbs and seasoning,
adding a little grated nutmeg, and also a little more minced parsley and mushrooms. Place small
pieces of butter over the whiting, moisten with the wine, and bake for 20 minutes in a hot
oven. If there should be too much sauce, reduce it by boiling over a sharp fire for a few minutes,
and pour under the fish. Serve with a cut lemon, and no other sauce.

WHITING AUX FINE HERBES.

347. INGREDIENTS.-1 bunch of sweet herbs chopped very fine; butter.

Mode.--Clean and skin the fish, fasten the tails in the mouths; and lay them in a baking-dish.
Mince the herbs very fine, strew them over the fish, and place small pieces of butter over;
cover with another dish, and let them simmer in a Dutch oven for 1/4 hour or 20 minutes. Turn
the fish once or twice, and serve with the sauce poured over.

    THE WHITING POUT, AND POLLACK.--About the mouth of the Thames,
    and generally all round the English coasts, as well as in the
    northern seas, the pout is plentiful. It bears a striking
    resemblance to the whiting, and is esteemed as an excellent
    fish.--The pollack is also taken all round our coasts, and
    likewise bears a striking resemblance to the whiting; indeed, it
    is sometimes mistaken by the inexperienced for that fish; its
    flesh being considered by many equally delicate.

TO DRESS WHITEBAIT.

348. INGREDIENTS.--A little flour, hot lard, seasoning of salt.

Mode.--This fish should be put into iced water as soon as bought, unless they are cooked immediately.
Drain them from the water in a colander, and have ready a nice clean dry cloth, over which
put 2 good handfuls of flour. Toss in the whitebait, shake them lightly in the cloth, and put
them in a wicker sieve to take away the superfluous flour. Throw them into a pan of boiling
lard, very few at a time, and let them fry till of a whitey-brown colour. Directly they are
done, they must he taken out, and laid before the fire for a minute or two on a sieve reversed,
covered with blotting-paper to absorb the fat. Dish them on a hot napkin, arrange the fish
very high in the centre, and sprinkle a little salt over the whole.

Time.--3 minutes.

Seasonable from April to August.

    WHITEBAIT.--This highly-esteemed little fish appears in
    innumerable multitudes in the river Thames, near Greenwich and
    Blackwall, during the month of July, when it forms, served with
    lemon and brown bread and butter, a tempting dish to vast
    numbers of Londoners, who flock to the various taverns of these
    places, in order to gratify their appetites. The fish has been
    supposed be the fry of the shad, the sprat, the smelt, or the
    bleak. Mr. Yarrell, however, maintains that it is a species in
    itself, distinct from every other fish. When fried with flour,
    it is esteemed a great delicacy. The ministers of the Crown have
    had a custom, for many years, of having a "whitebait dinner"
    just before the close of the session. It is invariably the
    precursor of the prorogation of Parliament, and the repast is
    provided by the proprietor of the "Trafalgar," Greenwich.

FISH PIE, WITH TENCH AND EELS.

349. INGREDIENTS.--2 tench, 2 eels, 2 onions, a faggot of herbs, 4 blades of mace, 3 anchovies,
1 pint of water, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, the yolks of 6
hard-boiled eggs, puff paste.

Mode.--Clean and bone the tench, skin and bone the eels, and cut them into pieces 2 inches
long, and leave the sides of the tench whole. Put the bones into a stewpan with the onions,
herbs, mace, anchovies, water, and seasoning, and let them simmer gently for 1 hour. Strain
it off, put it to cool, and skim off all the fat. Lay the tench and eels in a pie-dish, and
between each layer put seasoning, chopped parsley, and hard-boiled eggs; pour in part of the
strained liquor, cover in with puff paste, and bake for 1/2 hour or rather more. The oven should
be rather quick, and when done, heat the remainder of the liquor, which pour into the pie.

Time.--1/2 hour to bake, or rather more if the oven is slow.

FISH SCALLOP.

I.

350. INGREDIENTS.--Remains of cold fish of any sort, 1/2 pint of cream, 1/2 tablespoonful of
anchovy sauce, 1/2 teaspoonful of made mustard, ditto of walnut ketchup, pepper and salt to
taste (the above quantities are for 1/2 lb. of fish when picked); bread crumbs.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, carefully picking the fish from the bones; set
it on the fire, let it remain till nearly hot, occasionally stir the contents, but do not allow
it to boil. When done, put the fish into a deep dish or scallop shell, with a good quantity
of bread crumbs; place small pieces of butter on the top, set in a Dutch oven before the fire
to brown, or use a salamander.

Time.--1/4 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the cold fish, 10d.

II.

351. INGREDIENTS.--Any cold fish, 1 egg, milk, 1 large blade of pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful
of flour, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, pepper and salt to taste, bread crumbs, butter.

Mode.--Pick the fish carefully from the bones, and moisten with milk and the egg; add the other
ingredients, and place in a deep dish or scallop shells; cover with bread crumbs, butter the
top, and brown before the fire; when quite hot, serve.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost, exclusive of the cold fish, 4d.

WATER SOUCHY.

352. Perch, tench, soles, eels, and flounders are considered the best fish for this dish. For
the souchy, put some water into a stewpan with a bunch of chopped parsley, some roots, and
sufficient salt to make it brackish. Let these simmer for 1 hour, and then stew the fish in
this water. When they are done, take them out to drain, have ready some finely-chopped parsley,
and a few roots cut into slices of about one inch thick and an inch in length. Put the fish
in a tureen or deep dish, strain the liquor over them, and add the minced parsley and roots.
Serve with brown bread and butter.

353. SUPPLY OF FISH TO THE LONDON MARKET.--From Mr. Mayhew's work on "London Labour and the
London Poor," and other sources, we are enabled to give the following table of the total annual

  Periwinkles, 4000 to ditto              304,000,000

The whole of the above may be, in round numbers, reckoned to amount to the enormous number
of 3,000,000,000 fish, with a weight of 300,000 tons.

ADDENDUM AND ANECDOTE.

It will be seen, from the number and variety of the recipes which we have been enabled to give
under the head of FISH, that there exists in the salt ocean, and fresh-water rivers, an abundance
of aliment, which the present state of gastronomic art enables the cook to introduce to the
table in the most agreeable forms, and oftentimes at a very moderate cost.

Less nutritious as a food than the flesh of animals, more succulent than vegetables, fish may
be termed a middle dish, suited to all temperaments and constitutions; and one which those
who are recovering from illness may partake of with safety and advantage.

As to which is the best fish, there has been much discussion. The old Latin proverb, however,
de gustibus non disputandum, and the more modern Spanish one, sobre los gustos no hai disputa,
declare, with equal force, that where taste is concerned, no decision can be arrived at. Each
person's palate may be differently affected--pleased or displeased; and there is no standard
by which to judge why a red mullet, a sole, or a turbot, should be better or worse than a salmon,
trout, pike, or a tiny tench.

Fish, as we have explained, is less nourishing than meat; for it is lighter in weight, size
for size, and contains no ozmazome (see No. 100). Shell-fish, oysters particularly, furnish
but little nutriment; and this is the reason why so many of the latter can be eaten without
injury to the system.

In Brillat Savarin's [Footnote: Brillat Savarin was a French lawyer and judge of considerable
eminence and great talents, and wrote, under the above title, a book on gastronomy, full of
instructive information, enlivened with a fund of pleasantly-told anecdote.] clever and amusing
volume, "The Physiology of Taste," he says, that towards the end of the eighteenth century
it was a most common thing for a well-arranged entertainment in Paris to commence with oysters,
and that many guests were not contented without swallowing twelve dozen. Being anxious to know
the weight of this advanced-guard, he ascertained that a dozen oysters, fluid included, weighed
4 ounces,--thus, the twelve dozen would weigh about 3 lbs.; and there can be no doubt, that
the same persons who made no worse a dinner on account of having partaken of the oysters, would
have been completely satisfied if they had eaten the same weight of chicken or mutton. An anecdote,
perfectly well authenticated, is narrated of a French gentleman (M. Laperte), residing at Versailles,
who was extravagantly fond of oysters, declaring he never had enough. Savarin resolved to procure
him the satisfaction, and gave him an invitation to dinner, which was duly accepted. The guest
arrived, and his host kept company with him in swallowing the delicious bivalves up to the
tenth dozen, when, exhausted, he gave up, and let M. Laperte go on alone. This gentleman managed
to eat thirty-two dozen within an hour, and would doubtless have got through more, but the
person who opened them is described as not being very skilful. In the interim Savarin was idle,
and at length, tired with his painful state of inaction, he said to Laperte, whilst the latter
was still in full career, "Mon cher, you will not eat as many oysters to-day as you meant;
let us dine." They dined, and the insatiable oyster-eater acted at the repast as if he had
fasted for a week.

FISH CARVING.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING FISH.

In carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes, as, if these are broken,
the beauty of the fish is lost. The carver should be acquainted, too, with the choicest parts
and morsels; and to give each guest an equal share of these titbits should be his maxim. Steel
knives and forks should on no account be used in helping fish, as these are liable to impart
to it a very disagreeable flavour. Where silver fish-carvers are considered too dear to be
bought, good electro-plated ones answer very well, and are inexpensive. The prices set down
for them by Messrs. Slack, of the Strand, are from a guinea upwards.

COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS.

(For recipe, see No. 232; and for mode of serving, Coloured Plate C.)

First run the knife along the centre of the side of the fish, namely, from d to b, down to
the bone; then carve it in unbroken slices downwards from d to e, or upwards from d to c, as
shown in the engraving. The carver should ask the guests if they would like a portion of the
roe and liver.

Note.--Of this fish, the parts about the backbone and shoulders are the firmest, and most esteemed
by connoisseurs. The sound, which lines the fish beneath the backbone, is considered a delicacy,
as are also the gelatinous parts about the head and neck.

SALMON.

(For recipe, see No. 301; and for mode of dressing, Coloured Plate B.)

First run the knife quite down to the bone, along the side of the fish, from a to b, and also
from c to d. Then help the thick part lengthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from
a to b; and the thin part breadthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from e to f,
as shown in the engraving. A slice of the thick part should always be accompanied by a smaller
piece of the thin from the belly, where lies the fat of the fish.

Note.--Many persons, in carving salmon, make the mistake of slicing the thick part of this
fish in the opposite direction to that we have stated; and thus, by the breaking of the flakes,
the beauty of its appearance is destroyed.

BOILED OR FRIED SOLE.

(For recipes, see Nos. 321 and 327.)

The usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through, bone and all, distributing it
in nice and not too large pieces. A moderately-sized sole will be sufficient for three slices;
namely, the head, middle, and tail. The guests should be asked which of these they prefer.
A small one will only give two slices. If the sole is very large, the upper side may be raised
from the bone, and then divided into pieces; and the under side afterwards served in the same way.

In helping FILLETED SOLES, one fillet is given to each person. (For mode of serving, see Coloured
Plate A.)

TURBOT.

(For recipe, see No. 337; and for mode of serving, Coloured Plate E.)

First run the fish-slice down the thickest part of the fish, quite through to the bone, from
a to b, and then cut handsome and regular slices in the direction of the lines downwards, from
c to e, and upwards from c to d, as shown in the engraving. When the carver has removed all
the meat from the upper side of the fish, the backbone should be raised, put on one side of
the dish, and the under side helped as the upper.

A BRILL and JOHN DORY are carved in the same manner as a Turbot.

Note.--The thick parts of the middle of the back are the best slices in a turbot; and the rich
gelatinous skin covering the fish, as well as a little of the thick part of the fins, are dainty
morsels, and should be placed on each plate.

WHITING, &c.

Whiting, pike, haddock, and other fish, when of a sufficiently large size, may be carved in
the same manner as salmon. When small, they may be cut through, bone and all, and helped in
nice pieces, a middling-sized whiting serving for two slices.

Note.--The THICK part of the EEL is reckoned the best; and this holds good of all flat fish.

The TAIL of the LOBSTER is the prime part, and next to that the CLAWS.

SAUCES, PICKLES, GRAVIES, AND FORCEMEATS.

CHAPTER IX.

GENERAL REMARKS.

354. AN ANECDOTE IS TOLD of the prince de Soubise, who, intending to give an entertainment,
asked for the bill of fare. His chef came, presenting a list adorned with vignettes, and the
first article of which, that met the prince's eye, was "fifty hams." "Bertrand," said the prince,
"I think you must be extravagant; Fifty hams! do you intend to feast my whole regiment?" "No,
Prince, there will be but one on the table, and the surplus I need for my Espagnole, blondes,
garnitures, &c." "Bertrand, you are robbing me: this item will not do." "Monseigneur," said
the artiste, "you do not appreciate me. Give me the order, and I will put those fifty hams
in a crystal flask no longer than my thumb." The prince smiled, and the hams were passed. This
was all very well for the prince de Soubise; but as we do not write for princes and nobles
alone, but that our British sisters may make the best dishes out of the least expensive ingredients,
we will also pass the hams, and give a few general directions concerning Sauces, &c.

355. THE PREPARATION AND APPEARANCE OF SAUCES AND GRAVIES are of the highest consequence, and
in nothing does the talent and taste of the cook more display itself. Their special adaptability
to the various viands they are to accompany cannot be too much studied, in order that they
may harmonize and blend with them as perfectly, so to speak, as does a pianoforte accompaniment
with the voice of the singer.

356. THE GENERAL BASIS OF MOST GRAVIES and some sauces is the same stock as that used for soups
(see Nos. 104, 105, 106, and 107); and, by the employment of these, with, perhaps, an additional
slice of ham, a little spice, a few herbs, and a slight flavouring from some cold sauce or
ketchup, very nice gravies may be made for a very small expenditure. A milt (either of a bullock
or sheep), the shank-end of mutton that has already been dressed, and the necks and feet of
poultry, may all be advantageously used for gravy, where much is not required. It may, then,
be established as a rule, that there exists no necessity for good gravies to be expensive,
and that there is no occasion, as many would have the world believe, to buy ever so many pounds
of fresh meat, in order to furnish an ever so little quantity of gravy.

357. BROWN SAUCES, generally speaking, should scarcely be so thick as white sauces; and it
is well to bear in mind, that all those which are intended to mask the various dishes of poultry
or meat, should be of a sufficient consistency to slightly adhere to the fowls or joints over
which they are poured. For browning and thickening sauces, &c., browned flour may be properly
employed.

358. SAUCES SHOULD POSSESS A DECIDED CHARACTER; and whether sharp or sweet, savoury or plain,
they should carry out their names in a distinct manner, although, of course, not so much flavoured
as to make them too piquant on the one hand, or too mawkish on the other.

359. GRAVIES AND SAUCES SHOULD BE SENT TO TABLE VERY HOT; and there is all the more necessity
for the cook to see to this point, as, from their being usually served in small quantities,
they are more liable to cool quickly than if they were in a larger body. Those sauces, of which
cream or eggs form a component part, should be well stirred, as soon as these ingredients are
added to them, and must never be allowed to boil; as, in that case, they would instantly curdle.

360. ALTHOUGH PICKLES MAY BE PURCHASED at shops at as low a rate as they can usually be made
for at home, or perhaps even for less, yet we would advise all housewives, who have sufficient
time and convenience, to prepare their own. The only general rules, perhaps, worth stating
here,--as in the recipes all necessary details will be explained, are, that the vegetables
and fruits used should be sound, and not over ripe, and that the very best vinegar should be
employed.

361. FOR FORCEMEATS, SPECIAL ATTENTION IS NECESSARY. The points which cooks should, in this
branch of cookery, more particularly observe, are the thorough chopping of the suet, the complete
mincing of the herbs, the careful grating of the bread-crumbs, and the perfect mixing of the
whole. These are the three principal ingredients of forcemeats, and they can scarcely be cut
too small, as nothing like a lump or fibre should be anywhere perceptible. To conclude, the
flavour of no one spice or herb should be permitted to predominate.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER X.

SAUCES, PICKLES, GRAVIES, AND FORCEMEATS.

ANCHOVY SAUCE FOR FISH.

362. INGREDIENTS.--4 anchovies, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of melted butter, cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Bone the anchovies, and pound them in a mortar to a paste, with 1 oz. of butter. Make
the melted butter hot, stir in the pounded anchovies and cayenne; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes;
and if liked, add a squeeze of lemon-juice. A more general and expeditious way of making this
sauce is to stir in 1-1/2 tablespoonfuls of anchovy essence to 1/2 pint of melted butter, and
to add seasoning to taste. Boil the whole up for 1 minute, and serve hot.

Time.--5 minutes. Average cost, 5d. for 1/2 pint.

Sufficient, this quantity, for a brill, small turbot, 3 or 4 soles, &c.

ANCHOVY BUTTER (see No. 227).

    CAYENNE.--This is the most acrid and stimulating spice with
    which we are acquainted. It is a powder prepared from several
    varieties of the capsicum annual East-India plants, of which
    there are three so far naturalized in this country as to be able
    to grow in the open air: these are the Guinea, the Cherry, and
    the Bell pepper. All the pods of these are extremely pungent to
    the taste, and in the green state are used by us as a pickle.
    When ripe, they are ground into cayenne pepper, and sold as a
    condiment. The best of this, however, is made in the West
    Indies, from what is called the Bird pepper, on account of
    hens and turkeys being extremely partial to it. It is imported
    ready for use. Of the capiscum species of plants there are five;
    but the principal are,--1. Capsicum annuum, the common
    long-podded capsicum, which is cultivated in our gardens, and of
    which there are two varieties, one with red, and another with
    yellow fruit. 2. Capsicum baccatum, or bird pepper, which
    rises with a shrubby stalk four or five feet high, with its
    berries growing at the division of the branches: this is small,
    oval-shaped, and of a bright-red colour, from which, as we have
    said, the best cayenne is made. 3. Capsicum grossum, the
    bell-pepper: the fruit of this is red, and is the only kind fit
    for pickling.

APPLE SAUCE FOR GEESE, PORK, &c.

363. INGREDIENTS.--6 good-sized apples, sifted sugar to taste, a piece of butter the size of
a walnut, water.

Mode.--Pare, core, and quarter the apples, and throw them into cold water to preserve their
whiteness. Put them in a saucepan, with sufficient water to moisten them, and boil till soft
enough to pulp. Beat them up, adding sugar to taste, and a small piece of butter This quantity
is sufficient for a good-sized tureen.

Time.--According to the apples, about 3/4 hour. Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient, this quantity, for a goose or couple of ducks.

BROWN APPLE SAUCE.

364. INGREDIENTS.--6 good-sized apples, 1/2 pint of brown gravy, cayenne to taste.

Mode. Put the gravy in a stewpan, and add the apples, after having pared, cored, and quartered
them. Let them simmer gently till tender; beat them to a pulp, and season with cayenne. This
sauce is preferred by many to the preceding.

Time.--According to the apples, about 3/4 hour. Average cost, 6d.

ASPARAGUS SAUCE.

365. INGREDIENTS.--1 bunch of green asparagus, salt, 1 oz. of fresh butter, 1 small bunch of
parsley, 3 or 4 green onions, 1 large lump of sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of sauce tournée.

Mode.--Break the asparagus in the tender part, wash well, and put them into boiling salt and
water to render them green. When they are tender, take them out, and put them into cold water;
drain them on a cloth till all moisture is absorbed from them. Put the butter in a stewpan,
with the parsley and onions; lay in the asparagus, and fry the whole over a sharp fire for
5 minutes. Add salt, the sugar and sauce tournée, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Rub all
through a tammy, and if not a very good colour, use a little spinach green. This sauce should
be rather sweet.

Time.--Altogether 40 minutes.

Average cost for this quantity, 1s. 4d.

ASPIC, or ORNAMENTAL SAVOURY JELLY.

366. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of knuckle of veal, 1 cow-heel, 3 or 4 slices of ham, any poultry
trimmings, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, 1 glass of sherry, 3 quarts of water;
seasoning to taste of salt and whole white pepper; 3 eggs.

Mode.--Lay the ham on the bottom of a stewpan, cut up the veal and cow-heel into small pieces,
and lay them on the ham; add the poultry trimmings, vegetables, herbs, sherry, and water, and
let the whole simmer very gently for 4 hours, carefully taking away all scum that may rise
to the surface; strain through a fine sieve, and pour into an earthen pan to get cold. Have
ready a clean stewpan, put in the jelly, and be particular to leave the sediment behind, or
it will not be clear. Add the whites of 3 eggs, with salt and pepper, to clarify; keep stirring
over the fire, till the whole becomes very white; then draw it to the side, and let it stand
till clear. When this is the case, strain it through a cloth or jelly-bag, and use it for moulding
poultry, etc. (See Explanation of French Terms, page 44.) Tarragon vinegar may be added to
give an additional flavour.

Time.--Altogether 4-1/2 hours. Average cost for this quantity, 4s.

    WHITE PEPPER.--This is the produce of the same plant as that
    which produces the black pepper, from which it is manufactured
    by steeping this in lime and water, and rubbing it between the
    hands till the coats come off. The best berries only will bear
    this operation; hence the superior qualities of white pepper
    fetch a higher price than those of the other. It is less acrid
    than the black, and is much prized among the Chinese. It is
    sometimes adulterated with rice-flour, as the black is with
    burnt bread. The berries of the pepper-plant grow in spikes of
    from twenty to thirty, and are, when ripe, of a bright-red
    colour. After being gathered, which is done when they are green,
    they are spread out in the sun, where they dry and become black
    and shrivelled, when they are ready for being prepared for the
    market.

BECHAMEL, or FRENCH WHITE SAUCE.

367. INGREDIENTS.--1 small bunch of parsley, 2 cloves, 1/2 bay-leaf, 1 small faggot of savoury
herbs, salt to taste; 3 or 4 mushrooms, when obtainable; 2 pints of white stock, 1 pint of
cream, 1 tablespoonful of arrowroot.

Mode.--Put the stock into a stewpan, with the parsley, cloves, bay-leaf, herbs, and mushrooms;
add a seasoning of salt, but no pepper, as that would give the sauce a dusty appearance, and
should be avoided. When it has boiled long enough to extract the flavour of the herbs, etc.,
strain it, and boil it up quickly again, until it is nearly half-reduced. Now mix the arrowroot
smoothly with the cream, and let it simmer very gently for 5 minutes over a slow fire; pour
to it the reduced stock, and continue to simmer slowly for 10 minutes, if the sauce be thick.
If, on the contrary, it be too thin, it must be stirred over a sharp fire till it thickens.
This is the foundation of many kinds of sauces, especially white sauces. Always make it thick,
as you can easily thin it with cream, milk, or white stock.

Time.--Altogether, 2 hours. Average cost, 1s. per pint.

    THE CLOVE.--The clove-tree is a native of the Molucca Islands,
    particularly Amboyna, and attains the height of a laurel-tree,
    and no verdure is ever seen under it. From the extremities of
    the branches quantities of flowers grow, first white; then they
    become green, and next red and hard, when they have arrived at
    their clove state. When they become dry, they assume a yellowish
    hue, which subsequently changes into a dark brown. As an
    aromatic, the clove is highly stimulating, and yields an
    abundance of oil. There are several varieties of the clove; the
    best is called the royal clove, which is scarce, and which is
    blacker and smaller than the other kinds. It is a curious fact,
    that the flowers, when fully developed, are quite inodorous, and
    that the real fruit is not in the least aromatic. The form is
    that of a nail, having a globular head, formed of the four
    petals of the corolla, and four leaves of the calyx not
    expanded, with a nearly cylindrical germen, scarcely an inch in
    length, situate below.

BECHAMEL MAIGRE, or WITHOUT MEAT.

368. INGREDIENTS.--2 onions, 1 blade of mace, mushroom trimmings, a small bunch of parsley,
1 oz. of butter, flour, 1/2 pint of water, 1 pint of milk, salt, the juice of 1 lemon, 2 eggs.

Mode.--Put in a stewpan the milk, and 1/2 pint of water, with the onions, mace, mushrooms,
parsley, and salt. Let these simmer gently for 20 minutes. In the mean time, rub on a plate
1 oz. of flour and butter; put it to the liquor, and stir it well till it boils up; then place
it by the side of the fire, and continue stirring until it is perfectly smooth. Now strain
it through a sieve into a basin, after which put it back in the stewpan, and add the lemon-juice.
Beat up the yolks of the eggs with about 4 dessertspoonfuls of milk; strain this to the sauce,
keep stirring it over the fire, but do not let it boil, lest it curdle.

Time.--Altogether, 3/4 hour. Average cost, 5d. per pint.

This is a good sauce to pour over boiled fowls when they are a bad colour.

PICKLED BEETROOT.

369. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient vinegar to cover the beets, 2 oz. of whole pepper, 2 oz. of allspice
to each gallon of vinegar.

Mode.--Wash the beets free from dirt, and be very careful not to prick the outside skin, or
they would lose their beautiful colour. Put them into boiling water, let them simmer gently,
and when about three parts done, which will be in 1-1/2 hour, take them out and let them cool.
Boil the vinegar with pepper and allspice, in the above proportion, for ten minutes, and when
cold, pour it on the beets, which must be peeled and cut into slices about 1/2 inch thick.
Cover with bladder to exclude the air, and in a week they will be fit for use.

Average cost, 3s. per gallon.

    BLACK PEPPER.--This well-known aromatic spice is the fruit of a
    species of climbing vine, and is a native of the East Indies,
    and is extensively cultivated in Malabar and the eastern islands
    of Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, and others in the same latitude.
    It was formerly confined to these countries, but it has now been
    introduced to Cayenne. It is generally employed as a condiment;
    but it should never be forgotten, that, even in small
    quantities, it produces detrimental effects on inflammatory
    constitutions. Dr. Paris, in his work on Diet, says, "Foreign
    spices were not intended by Nature for the inhabitants of
    temperate climes; they are heating, and highly stimulant. I am,
    however, not anxious to give more weight to this objection than
    it deserves. Man is no longer the child of Nature, nor the
    passive inhabitant of any particular region. He ranges over
    every part of the globe, and elicits nourishment from the
    productions of every climate. Nature is very kind in favouring
    the growth of those productions which are most likely to answer
    our local wants. Those climates, for instance, which engender
    endemic diseases, are, in general, congenial to the growth of
    plants that operate as antidotes to them. But if we go to the
    East for tea, there is no reason why we should not go to the
    West for sugar. The dyspeptic invalid, however, should be
    cautious in their use; they may afford temporary benefit, at the
    expense of permanent mischief. It has been well said, that the
    best quality of spices is to stimulate the appetite, and their
    worst to destroy, by insensible degrees, the tone of the
    stomach. The intrinsic goodness of meats should always be
    suspected when they require spicy seasonings to compensate for
    their natural want of sapidity." The quality of pepper is known
    by rubbing it between the hands: that which withstands this
    operation is good, that which is reduced to powder by it is bad.
    The quantity of pepper imported into Europe is very great.

BENTON SAUCE (to serve with Hot or Cold Roast Beef).

370. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of scraped horseradish, 1 teaspoonful of made mustard, 1
teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.

Mode.--Grate or scrape the horseradish very fine, and mix it with the other ingredients, which
must be all well blended together; serve in a tureen. With cold meat, this sauce is a very
good substitute for pickles.

Average cost for this quantity, 2d.

BREAD SAUCE (to serve with Roast Turkey, Fowl, Game, &c.).

I.

371. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 3/4 of the crumb of a stale loaf, 1 onion; pounded mace,
cayenne, and salt to taste; 1 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Peel and quarter the onion, and simmer it in the milk till perfectly tender. Break the
bread, which should be stale, into small pieces, carefully picking out any hard outside pieces;
put it in a very clean saucepan, strain the milk over it, cover it up, and let it remain for
an hour to soak. Now beat it up with a fork very smoothly, add a seasoning of pounded mace,
cayenne, and salt, with 1 oz. of butter; give the whole one boil, and serve. To enrich this
sauce, a small quantity of cream may be added just before sending it to table.

Time.--Altogether, 1-3/4 hour.

Average cost for this quantity, 4d.

Sufficient to serve with a turkey, pair of fowls, or brace of partridges.

    MACE.--This is the membrane which surrounds the shell of the
    nutmeg. Its general qualities are the same as those of the
    nutmeg, producing an agreeable aromatic odour, with a hot and
    acrid taste. It is of an oleaginous nature, is yellowish in its
    hue, and is used largely as a condiment. In "Beeton's
    Dictionary" we find that the four largest of the Banda Islands
    produce 150,000 lbs. of it annually, which, with nutmegs, are
    their principal articles of export.

II.

372. INGREDIENTS.--Giblets of poultry, 3/4 lb. of the crumb of a stale loaf, 1 onion, 12 whole
peppers, 1 blade of mace, salt to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream or melted butter, 1 pint
of water.

Mode.--Put the giblets, with the head, neck, legs, &c., into a stewpan; add the onion, pepper,
mace, salt, and rather more than 1 pint of water. Let this simmer for an hour, when strain
the liquor over the bread, which should be previously grated or broken into small pieces. Cover
up the saucepan, and leave it for an hour by the side of the fire; then beat the sauce up with
a fork until no lumps remain, and the whole is nice and smooth. Let it boil for 3 or 4 minutes;
keep stirring it until it is rather thick; when add 3 tablespoonfuls of good melted butter
or cream, and serve very hot.

Time.--2-1/4 hours. Average cost, 6d.

BROWNING FOR GRAVIES AND SAUCES.

373. The browning for soups (see No. 108) answers equally well for sauces and gravies, when
it is absolutely necessary to colour them in this manner; but where they can be made to look
brown by using ketchup, wine, browned flour, tomatoes, or any colour sauce, it is far preferable.
As, however, in cooking, so much depends on appearance, perhaps it would be as well for the
inexperienced cook to use the artificial means (No. 108). When no browning is at hand, and
you wish to heighten the colour of your gravy, dissolve a lump of sugar in an iron spoon over
a sharp fire; when it is in a liquid state, drop it into the sauce or gravy quite hot. Care,
however, must be taken not to put in too much, as it would impart a very disagreeable flavour.

BEURRE NOIR, or BROWNED BUTTER (a French Sauce).

374. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 3 tablespoonfuls of
vinegar, salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Put the butter into a fryingpan over a nice clear fire, and when it smokes, throw in
the parsley, and add the vinegar and seasoning. Let the whole simmer for a minute or two, when
it is ready to serve. This is a very good sauce for skate.

Time.--1/4 hour.

CLARIFIED BUTTER.

375. Put the butter in a basin before the fire, and when it melts, stir it round once or twice,
and let it settle. Do not strain it unless absolutely necessary, as it causes so much waste.
Pour it gently off into a clean dry jar, carefully leaving all sediment behind. Let it cool,
and carefully exclude the air by means of a bladder, or piece of wash-leather, tied over. If
the butter is salt, it may be washed before melting, when it is to be used for sweet dishes.

MELTED BUTTER.

I.

376. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, a dessertspoonful of flour, 1 wineglassful of water,
salt to taste.

Mode.--Cut the butter up into small pieces, put it in a saucepan, dredge over the flour, and
add the water and a seasoning of salt; stir it one way constantly till the whole of the ingredients
are melted and thoroughly blended. Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve. If the butter
is to be melted with cream, use the same quantity as of water, but omit the flour; keep stirring
it, but do not allow it to boil.

Time.--1 minute to simmer.

Average cost for this quantity, 4d.

II.

(More Economical.)

377. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, salt to taste, 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Mix the flour and water to a smooth batter, which put into a saucepan. Add the butter
and a seasoning of salt, keep stirring one way till all the ingredients are melted and perfectly
smooth; let the whole boil for a minute or two, and serve.

Time.--2 minutes to simmer.

Average cost for this quantity, 2d.

MELTED BUTTER (the French Sauce Blanche).

378. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour, salt to taste, 1/2 gill
of water, 1/2 spoonful of white vinegar, a very little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Mix the flour and water to a smooth batter, carefully rubbing down with the back of
a spoon any lumps that may appear. Put it in a saucepan with all the other ingredients, and
let it thicken on the fire, but do not allow it to boil, lest it should taste of the flour.

Time.--1 minute to simmer.

Average cost, 5d. for this quantity.

    NUTMEG.--This is a native of the Moluccas, and was long kept
    from being spread in other places by the monopolizing spirit of
    the Dutch, who endeavoured to keep it wholly to themselves by
    eradicating it from every other island. We find it stated in
    "Beeton's Dictionary of Universal Information," under the
    article "Banda Islands," that the four largest are appropriated
    to the cultivation of nutmegs, of which about 500,000 lbs. are
    annually produced. The plant, through the enterprise of the
    British, has now found its way into Penang and Bencooleu, where
    it flourishes and produces well. It has also been tried to be
    naturalized in the West Indies, and it bears fruit all the year
    round. There are two kinds of nutmeg,--one wild, and long and
    oval-shaped, the other cultivated, and nearly round. The best is
    firm and hard, and has a strong aromatic odour, with a hot and
    acrid taste. It ought to be used with caution by those who are
    of paralytic or apoplectic habits.

THICKENED BUTTER.

379.--INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of melted butter, No. 376, the yolks of 2 eggs, a little lemon-juice.

Mode.--Make the butter quite hot, and be careful not to colour it. Well whisk the yolks of
the eggs, pour them to the butter, beating them all the while. Make the sauce hot over the
fire, but do not let it boil; add a squeeze of lemon-juice.

MELTED BUTTER MADE WITH MILK.

380. INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz. butter, 1/3 pint of milk, a few grains of salt.

Mode.--Mix the butter and flour smoothly together on a plate, put it into a lined saucepan,
and pour in the milk. Keep stirring it one way over a sharp fire; let it boil quickly for a
minute or two, and it is ready to serve. This is a very good foundation for onion, lobster,
or oyster sauce: using milk instead of water makes it look so much whiter and more delicate.

Time.--Altogether, 10 minutes. Average cost for this quantity, 3d.

CAMP VINEGAR.

381. INGREDIENTS.--1 head of garlic, 1/2 oz. cayenne, 2 teaspoonfuls of soy, 2 ditto walnut
ketchup, 1 pint of vinegar, cochineal to colour.

Mode.--Slice the garlic, and put it, with all the above ingredients, into a clean bottle. Let
it stand to infuse for a month, when strain it off quite clear, and it will be fit for use.
Keep it in small bottles well sealed, to exclude the air.

Average cost for this quantity, 8d.

CAPER SAUCE FOR BOILED MUTTON.

382. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter (No. 376), 3 tablespoonfuls of capers or nasturtiums,
1 tablespoonful of their liquor.

Mode.--Chop the capers twice or thrice, and add them, with their liquor, to 1/2 pint of melted
butter, made very smoothly; keep stirring well; let the sauce just simmer, and serve in a tureen.
Pickled nasturtium-pods are fine-flavoured, and by many are eaten in preference to capers.
They make an excellent sauce.

Time.--2 minutes to simmer. Average cost for this quantity, 8d.

Sufficient to serve with a leg of mutton.

CAPER SAUCE FOR FISH.

383.

Mode.--Cut the capers across once or twice, but do not chop them fine; put them in a saucepan
with 1/2 pint of good melted butter, and add all the other ingredients. Keep stirring the whole
until it just simmers, when it is ready to serve.

Time.--1 minute to simmer. Average cost for this quantity, 5d.

Sufficient to serve with a skate, or 2 or 3 slices of salmon.

    CAPERS.--These are the unopened buds of a low trailing shrub,
    which grows wild among the crevices of the rocks of Greece, as
    well as in northern Africa: the plant, however, has come to be
    cultivated in the south of Europe. After being pickled in
    vinegar and salt, they are imported from Sicily, Italy, and the
    south of France. The best are from Toulon.

A SUBSTITUTE FOR CAPER SAUCE.

384. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376, 2 tablespoonfuls of cut parsley, 1/2
teaspoonful of salt, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar.

Mode.--Boil the parsley slowly to let it become a bad colour; cut, but do not chop it fine.
Add it to 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter, with salt and vinegar in the above proportions.

PICKLED CAPSICUMS.

385. INGREDIENTS.--Vinegar, 1/4 oz. of pounded mace, and 1/4 oz. of grated nutmeg, to each
quart; brine.

Mode.--Gather the pods with the stalks on, before they turn red; slit them down the side with
a small-pointed knife, and remove the seeds only; put them in a strong brine for 3 days, changing
it every morning; then take them out, lay them on a cloth, with another one over them, until
they are perfectly free from moisture. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, with mace and
nutmeg in the above proportions; put the pods in a jar, pour over the vinegar when cold, and
exclude them from the air by means of a wet bladder tied over.

CAYENNE VINEGAR, or ESSENCE OF CAYENNE.

386. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz. of cayenne pepper, 1/2 pint of strong spirit, or 1 pint of vinegar.

Mode.--Put the vinegar, or spirit, into a bottle, with the above proportion of cayenne, and
let it steep for a month, when strain off and bottle for use. This is excellent seasoning for
soups or sauces, but must be used very sparingly.

CELERY SAUCE, FOR BOILED TURKEY, POULTRY, &c.

387. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of celery, 1 pint of white stock, No. 107, 2 blades of mace, 1 small
bunch of savoury herbs; thickening of butter and flour, or arrowroot, 1/2 pint of cream, lemon-juice.

Mode.--Boil the celery in salt and water, until tender, and cut it into pieces 2 inches long.
Put the stock into a stewpan with the mace and herbs, and let it simmer for 1/2 hour to extract
their flavour. Then strain the liquor, add the celery and a thickening of butter kneaded with
flour, or, what is still better, with arrowroot; just before serving, put in the cream, boil
it up and squeeze in a little lemon-juice. If necessary, add a seasoning of salt and white pepper.

Time.--25 minutes to boil the celery. Average cost, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient, this quantity, for a boiled turkey.

This sauce may be made brown by using gravy instead of white stock, and flavouring it with
mushroom ketchup or Harvey's sauce.

    ARROWROOT.--This nutritious fecula is obtained from the roots of
    a plant which is cultivated in both the East and West Indies.
    When the roots are about a year old, they are dug up, and, after
    being well washed, are beaten to a pulp, which is afterwards, by
    means of water, separated from the fibrous part. After being
    passed through a sieve, once more washed, and then suffered to
    settle, the sediment is dried in the sun, when it has become
    arrowroot. The best is obtained from the West Indies, but a
    large quantity of what is sold in London is adulterated with
    potato-starch. As a means of knowing arrowroot when it is good,
    it may be as well to state, that the genuine article, when
    formed into a jelly, will remain firm for three or four days,
    whilst the adulterated will become as thin as milk in the course
    of twelve hours.

CELERY SAUCE (a More Simple Recipe).

388. INGREDIENTS.--4 heads of celery, 1/2 pint of melted butter, made with milk (No. 380),
1 blade of pounded mace; salt and white pepper to taste.

Mode.--Wash the celery, boil it in salt and water till tender, and cut it into pieces 2 inches
long; make 1/2 pint melted butter by recipe No. 380; put in the celery, pounded mace, and seasoning;
simmer for three minutes, when the sauce will be ready to serve.

Time.--25 minutes to boil the celery. Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient, this quantity, for a boiled fowl.

CELERY VINEGAR.

389. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 oz. of celery-seed, 1 pint of vinegar.

Mode.--Crush the seed by pounding it in a mortar; boil the vinegar, and when cold, pour it
to the seed; let it infuse for a fortnight, when strain and bottle off for use. This is frequently
used in salads.

CHESTNUT SAUCE FOR FOWLS OR TURKEY.

390. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of chestnuts, 1/2 pint of white stock, 2 strips of lemon-peel, cayenne
to taste, 1/4 pint of cream or milk.

Mode.--Peel off the outside skin of the chestnuts, and put them into boiling water for a few
minutes; take off the thin inside peel, and put them into a saucepan, with the white stock
and lemon-peel, and let them simmer for 1-1/2 hour, or until the chestnuts are quite tender.
Rub the whole through a hair-sieve with a wooden spoon; add seasoning and the cream; let it
just simmer, but not boil, and keep stirring all the time. Serve very hot; and quickly. If
milk is used instead of cream, a very small quantity of thickening may be required: that, of
course, the cook will determine.

Time.--Altogether nearly two hours. Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient, this quantity, for a turkey.

BROWN CHESTNUT SAUCE.

391.

Mode.--Prepare the chestnuts as in the foregoing recipe, by scalding and peeling them; put
them in a stewpan with the stock and sugar, and simmer them till tender. When done, add Spanish
sauce in the above proportion, and rub the whole through a tammy. Keep this sauce rather liquid,
as it is liable to thicken.

Time.--1-1/2 hour to simmer the chestnuts. Average cost, 8d.

BENGAL RECIPE FOR MAKING MANGO CHETNEY.

392. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lbs. of moist sugar, 3/4 lb. of salt, 1/4 lb. of garlic, 1/4 lb. of
onions, 3/4 lb. of powdered ginger, 1/4 lb. of dried chilies, 3/4 lb. of mustard-seed, 3/4
lb. of stoned raisins, 2 bottles of best vinegar, 30 large unripe sour apples.

Mode.--The sugar must be made into syrup; the garlic, onions, and ginger be finely pounded
in a mortar; the mustard-seed be washed in cold vinegar, and dried in the sun; the apples be
peeled, cored, and sliced, and boiled in a bottle and a half of the vinegar. When all this
is done, and the apples are quite cold, put them into a large pan, and gradually mix the whole
of the rest of the ingredients, including the remaining half-bottle of vinegar. It must be
well stirred until the whole is thoroughly blended, and then put into bottles for use. Tie
a piece of wet bladder over the mouths of the bottles, after they are well corked. This chetney
is very superior to any which can be bought, and one trial will prove it to be delicious.

Note.--This recipe was given by a native to an English lady, who had long been a resident in
India, and who, since her return to her native country, has become quite celebrated amongst
her friends for the excellence of this Eastern relish.

    GARLIC.--The smell of this plant is generally considered
    offensive, and it is the most acrimonious in its taste of the
    whole of the alliaceous tribe. In 1548 it was introduced to
    England from the shores of the Mediterranean, where it is
    abundant, and in Sicily it grows naturally. It was in greater
    repute with our ancestors than it is with ourselves, although it
    is still used as a seasoning herb. On the continent, especially
    in Italy, it is much used, and the French consider it an
    essential in many made dishes.

CHILI VINEGAR.

393. INGREDIENTS.--50 fresh red English chilies, 1 pint of vinegar.

Mode.--Pound or cut the chilies in half, and infuse them in the vinegar for a fortnight, when
it will be fit for use. This will be found an agreeable relish to fish, as many people cannot
eat it without the addition of an acid and cayenne pepper.

CHRISTOPHER NORTH'S SAUCE FOR MEAT OR GAME.

394. INGREDIENTS.-1 glass of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of Harvey's sauce, 1 dessertspoonful
of mushroom ketchup, ditto of pounded white sugar, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/4 teaspoonful
of cayenne pepper, ditto of salt.

Mode.--Mix all the ingredients thoroughly together, and heat the sauce gradually, by placing
the vessel in which it is made in a saucepan of boiling water. Do not allow it to boil, and
serve directly it is ready. This sauce, if bottled immediately, will keep good for a fortnight,
and will be found excellent.

CONSOMME, or WHITE STOCK FOR MANY SAUCES.

395. Consommé is made precisely in the same manner as stock No. 107, and, for ordinary purposes,
will be found quite good enough. When, however, a stronger stock is desired, either put in
half the quantity of water, or double that of the meat. This is a very good foundation for
all white sauces.

CRAB SAUCE FOR FISH (equal to Lobster Sauce).

396.

Mode.--Choose a nice fresh crab, pick all the meat away from the shell, and cut it into small
square pieces. It should not boil.

Average cost, 1s. 2d.

CREAM SAUCE FOR FISH OR WHITE DISHES.

397. INGREDIENTS.--1/3 pint of cream, 2 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, salt and cayenne
to taste; when liked, a small quantity of pounded mace or lemon-juice.

Mode.--Put the butter in a very clean saucepan, dredge in the flour, and keep shaking round
till the butter is melted. Add the seasoning and cream, and stir the whole till it boils; let
it just simmer for 5 minutes, when add either pounded mace or lemon-juice to taste, to give
it a flavour.

Time.--5 minutes to simmer. Average cost for this quantity, 7d.

This sauce may be flavoured with very finely-shredded shalot.

CUCUMBER SAUCE.

398. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 cucumbers, 2 oz. of butter, 6 tablespoonfuls of brown gravy.

Mode.--Peel the cucumbers, quarter them, and take out the seeds; cut them into small pieces;
put them in a cloth, and rub them well, to take out the water which hangs about them. Put the
butter in a saucepan, add the cucumbers, and shake them over a sharp fire until they are of
a good colour. Then pour over it the gravy, mix this with the cucumbers, and simmer gently
for 10 minutes, when it will be ready to serve.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.

PICKLED CUCUMBERS.

399. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of whole pepper, 1 oz. of bruised ginger; sufficient vinegar to cover
the cucumbers.

Mode.--Cut the cucumbers in thick slices, sprinkle salt over them, and let them remain for
24 hours. The next day, drain them well for 6 hours, put them into a jar, pour boiling vinegar
over them, and keep them in a warm place. In a short time, boil up the vinegar again, add pepper
and ginger in the above proportion, and instantly cover them up. Tie them down with bladder,
and in a few days they will be fit for use.

    LONG PEPPER.--This is the produce of a different plant from that
    which produces the black, it consisting of the half-ripe
    flower-heads of what naturalists call Piper longum and
    chaba. It is the growth, however, of the same countries;
    indeed, all the spices are the produce of tropical climates
    only. Originally, the most valuable of these were found in the
    Spice Islands, or Moluccas, of the Indian Ocean, and were highly
    prized by the nations of antiquity. The Romans indulged in them
    to a most extravagant degree. The long pepper is less aromatic
    than the black, but its oil is more pungent.

CUCUMBER SAUCE, WHITE.

400. INGREDIENTS.--3 or four cucumbers, 1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107, cayenne and salt
to taste, the yolks of 3 eggs.

Mode.--Cut the cucumbers into small pieces, after peeling them and taking out the seeds. Put
them in a stewpan with the white stock and seasoning; simmer gently till the cucumbers are
tender, which will be in about 1/4 hour. Then add the yolks of the eggs well beaten; stir them
to the sauce, but do not allow it to boil, and serve very hot.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.

CUCUMBER VINEGAR (a very nice Addition to Salads).

401. INGREDIENTS.--10 large cucumbers, or 12 smaller ones, 1 quart of vinegar, 2 onions, 2
shalots, 1 tablespoonful of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of pepper, 1/4 teaspoonful of cayenne.

Mode.--Pare and slice the cucumbers, put them in a stone jar or wide-mouthed bottle, with the
vinegar; slice the onions and shalots, and add them, with all the other ingredients, to the
cucumbers. Let it stand 4 or 5 days, boil it all up, and when cold, strain the liquor through
a piece of muslin, and store it away in small bottles well sealed. This vinegar is a very nice
addition to gravies, hashes, &e., as well as a great improvement to salads, or to eat with
cold meat.

GERMAN METHOD OF KEEPING CUCUMBERS FOR WINTER USE.

402. INGREDIENTS.--Cucumbers, salt.

Mode.--Pare and slice the cucumbers (as for the table), sprinkle well with salt, and let them
remain for 24 hours; strain off the liquor, pack in jars, a thick layer of cucumbers and salt
alternately; tie down closely, and, when wanted for use, take out the quantity required. Now
wash them well in fresh water, and dress as usual with pepper, vinegar, and oil.

    THE CUCUMBER.--Though the melon is far superior in point of
    flavour to this fruit, yet it is allied to the cucumber, which
    is known to naturalists as Cucumia sativus. The modern
    Egyptians, as did their forefathers, still eat it, and others of
    its class. Cucumbers were observed, too, by Bishop Heber,
    beyond the Ganges, in India; and Burckhardt noticed them in
    Palestine. (See No. 127.)

AN EXCELLENT WAY OF PRESERVING CUCUMBERS.

403. INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water; 1 lb. of lump sugar, the rind of 1 lemon, 1 oz. of ginger,
cucumbers.

Mode.--Choose the greenest cucumbers, and those that are most free from seeds; put them in
strong salt and water, with a cabbage-leaf to keep them down; tie a paper over them, and put
them in a warm place till they are yellow; then wash them and set them over the fire in fresh
water, with a very little salt, and another cabbage-leaf over them; cover very closely, but
take care they do not boil. If they are not a fine green, change the water again, cover them
as before, and make them hot. When they are a good colour, take them off the fire and let them
cool; cut them in quarters, take out the seeds and pulp, and put them into cold water. Let
them remain for 2 days, changing the water twice each day, to draw out the salt. Put the sugar,
with 1/4 pint of water, in a saucepan over the fire; remove the scum as it rises, and add the
lemon-peel and ginger with the outside scraped off; when the syrup is tolerably thick, take
it off the fire, and when cold, wipe the cucumbers dry, and put them in. Boil the syrup once
in 2 or 3 days for 3 weeks; strengthen it if required, and let it be quite cold before the
cucumbers are put in. Great attention must be paid to the directions in the commencement of
this recipe, as, if these are not properly carried out, the result will be far from satisfactory.

Seasonable.--This recipe should be used in June, July, or August.

    COMMON SALT.--By this we mean salt used for cooking purposes,
    which is found in great abundance both on land and in the waters
    of the ocean. Sea or salt water, as it is often called,
    contains, it has been discovered, about three per cent, of salt
    on an average. Solid rocks of salt are also found in various
    parts of the world, and the county of Chester contains many of
    these mines, and it is from there that much of our salt comes.
    Some springs are so highly impregnated with salt, as to have
    received the name of "brine" springs, and are supposed to have
    become so by passing through the salt rocks below ground, and
    thus dissolving a portion of this mineral substance. We here
    give an engraving of a salt-mine at Northwich, Cheshire, where
    both salt-mines and brine-springs are exceedingly productive,
    and are believed to have been wrought so far back as during the
    occupation of Britain by the Romans.

CUSTARD SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS OR TARTS.

404. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 2 eggs, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.

Mode.--Put the milk in a very clean saucepan, and let it boil. Beat the eggs, stir to them
the milk and pounded sugar, and put the mixture into a jug. Place the jug in a saucepan of
boiling water; keep stirring well until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will
curdle. Serve the sauce in a tureen, stir in the brandy, and grate a little nutmeg over the
top. This sauce may be made very much nicer by using cream instead of milk; but the above recipe
will be found quite good enough for ordinary purposes.

Average cost, 6d. per pint.

Sufficient, this quantity, for 2 fruit tarts, or 1 pudding.

DUTCH SAUCE FOR FISH.

405. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
the yolks of 2 eggs, the juice of 1/2 lemon; salt to taste.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients, except the lemon-juice, into a stew-pan; set it over the fire,
and keep continually stirring. When it is sufficiently thick, take it off, as it should not
boil. If, however, it happens to curdle, strain the sauce through a tammy, add the lemon-juice,
and serve. Tarragon vinegar may be used instead of plain, and, by many, is considered far preferable.

Average cost, 6d.

Note.--This sauce may be poured hot over salad, and left to get quite cold, when it should
be thick, smooth, and somewhat stiff. Excellent salads may be made of hard eggs, or the remains
of salt fish flaked nicely from the bone, by pouring over a little of the above mixture when
hot, and allowing it to cool.

    THE LEMON.--This fruit is a native of Asia, and is mentioned by
    Virgil as an antidote to poison. It is hardier than the orange,
    and, as one of the citron tribe, was brought into Europe by the
    Arabians. The lemon was first cultivated in England in the
    beginning of the 17th century, and is now often to be found in
    our green-houses. The kind commonly sold, however, is imported
    from Portugal, Spain, and the Azores. Some also come from St.
    Helena; but those from Spain are esteemed the best. Its juice is
    now an essential for culinary purposes; but as an antiscorbutic
    its value is still greater. This juice, which is called citric
    acid, may be preserved in bottles for a considerable time, by
    covering it with a thin stratum of oil. Shrub is made from it
    with rum and sugar.

GREEN DUTCH SAUCE, or HOLLANDAISE VERTE.

406. INGREDIENTS.--6 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel, No. 367, seasoning to taste of salt and cayenne,
a little parsley-green to colour, the juice of 1/2 a lemon.

Mode.--Put the Béchamel into a saucepan with the seasoning, and bring it to a boil. Make a
green colouring by pounding some parsley in a mortar, and squeezing all the juice from it.
Let this just simmer, when add it to the sauce. A moment before serving, put in the lemon-juice,
but not before; for otherwise the sauce would turn yellow, and its appearance be thus spoiled.

Average cost, 4d.

    BÉCHAMEL SAUCE--This sauce takes its name from a Monsieur
    Béchamel, a rich French financier, who, according to Borne
    authorities, invented it; whilst others affirm he only
    patronized it. Be this as it may, it is one of the most pleasant
    sauces which come to table, and should be most carefully and
    intelligently prepared. It is frequently used, as in the above
    recipe, as a principal ingredient and basis for other sauces.

TO PICKLE EGGS.

407. INGREDIENTS.--16 eggs, 1 quart of vinegar, 1/2 oz. of Black pepper, 1/2 oz. of Jamaica
pepper, 1/2 oz. of ginger.

Mode.--Boil the eggs for 12 minutes, then dip them into cold water, and take off the shells.
Put the vinegar, with the pepper and ginger, into a stewpan, and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
Now place the eggs in a jar, pour over them the vinegar, &c., boiling hot, and, when cold,
tie them down with bladder to exclude the air. This pickle will be ready for use in a month.

Average cost, for this quantity, 1s. 9d.

Seasonable.--This should be made about Easter, as at this time eggs are plentiful and cheap.
A store of pickled eggs will be found very useful and ornamental in serving with many first
and second course dishes.

    The ginger-plant, known to naturalists as Zingiber officinale,
    is a native, of the East and West Indies. It grows somewhat like
    the lily of the valley, but its height is about three feet. In
    Jamaica it flowers about August or September, fading about the
    end of the year. The fleshy creeping roots, which form the
    ginger of commerce, are in a proper state to be dug when the
    stalks are entirely withered. This operation is usually
    performed in January and February; and when the roots are taken
    out of the earth, each one is picked, scraped, separately
    washed, and afterwards very carefully dried. Ginger is generally
    considered as less pungent and heating to the system than might
    he expected from its effects on the organs of taste, and it is
    frequently used, with considerable effect, as an anti-spasmodic
    and carminative.

EGG BALLS FOR SOUPS AND MADE DISHES.

408. INGREDIENTS.--8 eggs, a little flour; seasoning to taste of salt.

Mode.--Boil 6 eggs for 20 minutes, strip off the shells, take the yolks and pound them in a
mortar. Beat the yolks of the other 2 eggs; add them, with a little flour and salt, to those
pounded; mix all well together, and roll into balls. Boil them before they are put into the
soup or other dish they may be intended for.

Time.--20 minutes to boil the eggs. Average cost, for this quantity, 8d.

Sufficient, 2 dozen balls for 1 tureen of soup.

EGG SAUCE FOR SALT FISH.

409. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376; when liked, a very little lemon-juice.

Mode.--Boil the eggs until quite hard, which will be in about 20 minutes, and put them into
cold water for 1/2 hour. Strip off the shells, chop the eggs into small pieces, not, however,
too fine. Make the melted butter very smoothly, by recipe No. 376, and, when boiling, stir
in the eggs, and serve very hot. Lemon-juice may be added at pleasure.

Time.--20 minutes to boil the eggs. Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient.--This quantity for 3 or 4 lbs. of fish.

Note.--When a thicker sauce is required, use one or two more eggs to the same quantity of melted
butter.

EPICUREAN SAUCE FOR STEAKS, CHOPS, GRAVIES, OR FISH.

410. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of walnut ketchup, 1/4 pint of mushroom ditto, 2 tablespoonfuls
of Indian soy, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine; 1/4 oz. of white pepper, 2 oz. of shalots, 1/4
oz. of cayenne, 1/4 oz. of cloves, 3/4 pint of vinegar.

Mode.--Put the whole of the ingredients into a bottle, and let it remain for a fortnight in
a warm place, occasionally shaking up the contents. Strain, and bottle off for use. This sauce
will be found an agreeable addition to gravies, hashes, stews, &c.

Average cost, for this quantity, 1s. 6d.

    SHALOT, OR ESCHALOT.--This plant is supposed to have been
    introduced to England by the Crusaders, who found it growing
    wild in the vicinity of Ascalon. It is a bulbous root, and when
    full grown, its leaves wither in July. They ought to be taken up
    in the autumn, and when dried in the house, will keep till
    spring. It is called by old authors the "barren onion," and is
    used in sauces and pickles, soups and made dishes, and as an
    accompaniment to chops and steaks.

ESPAGNOLE, OR BROWN SPANISH SAUCE.

411. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of lean ham, 1 lb. of veal, 1-1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107;
2 or 3 sprigs of parsley, 1/2 a bay-leaf, 2 or 3 sprigs of savoury herbs, 6 green onions, 3
shalots, 2 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 glasses of sherry or Madeira, thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Cut up the ham and veal into small square pieces, and put them into a stewpan. Moisten
these with 1/2 pint of the stock No. 107, and simmer till the bottom of the stewpan is covered
with a nicely-coloured glaze, when put in a few more spoonfuls to detach it. Add the remainder
of the stock, with the spices, herbs, shalots, and onions, and simmer very gently for 1 hour.
Strain and skim off every particle of fat, and when required for use, thicken with butter and
flour, or with a little roux.

Note.--The wine in this sauce may be omitted, and an onion sliced and fried of a nice brown
substituted for it. This sauce or gravy is used for many dishes, and with most people is a
general favourite.

FENNEL SAUCE FOR MACKEREL.

412. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376, rather more than 1 tablespoonful of
chopped fennel.

Mode.--Make the melted butter very smoothly, by recipe No. 376; chop the fennel rather small,
carefully cleansing it from any grit or dirt, and put it to the butter when this is on the
point of boiling. Simmer for a minute or two, and serve in a tureen.

Time.--2 minutes.

Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient to serve with 5 or 6 mackerel.

    FENNEL.--This elegantly-growing plant, of which the Latin name
    is Anethum foeniculum, grows best in chalky soils, where,
    indeed, it is often found wild. It is very generally cultivated
    in gardens, and has much improved on its original form. Various
    dishes are frequently ornamented and garnished with its graceful
    leaves, and these are sometimes boiled in soups, although it is
    more usually confined, in English cookery, to the mackerel sauce
    as here given.

FISH SAUCE.

413. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of cayenne, 2 tablespoonfuls of walnut ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls
of soy, a few shreds of garlic and shalot, 1 quart of vinegar.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a large bottle, and shake well every day for a fortnight.
Keep it in small bottles well sealed, and in a few days it will be fit for use.

Average cost, for this quantity, 1s.

FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR FISH SOUPS.

414. INGREDIENTS.--1 middling-sized lobster, 1/2 an anchovy, 1 head of boiled celery, the yolk
of a hard-boiled egg; salt, cayenne, and mace to taste; 4 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 2
oz. of butter, 2 eggs.

Mode.--Pick the meat from the shell of the lobster, and pound it, with the soft parts, in a
mortar; add the celery, the yolk of the hard-boiled egg, seasoning, and bread crumbs. Continue
pounding till the whole is nicely amalgamated. Warm the butter till it is in a liquid state;
well whisk the eggs, and work these up with the pounded lobster-meat. Make into balls of about
an inch in diameter, and fry of a nice pale brown.

Sufficient, from 18 to 20 balls for 1 tureen of soup.

FORCEMEAT FOR COLD SAVOURY PIES.

415.

Mode.--Chop the veal and bacon together, and put them in a mortar with the other ingredients
mentioned above. Pound well, and bind with 1 or 2 eggs which have been previously beaten and
strained. Work the whole well together, and the forcemeat will be ready for use. If the pie
is not to be eaten immediately, omit the herbs and parsley, as these would prevent it from
keeping. Mushrooms or truffles may be added.

Sufficient for 2 small pies.

    MARJORAM.--Although there are several species of marjoram, that
    which is known as the sweet or knotted marjoram, is the one
    usually preferred in cookery. It is a native of Portugal, and
    when its leaves are used as a seasoning herb, they have an
    agreeable aromatic flavour. The winter sweet marjoram used for
    the same purposes, is a native of Greece, and the pot-marjoram
    is another variety brought from Sicily. All of them are
    favourite ingredients in soups, stuffings, &c.

FORCEMEAT FOR PIKE, CARP, HADDOCK, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF FISH.

416. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of fresh butter, 1 oz. of suet, 1 oz. of fat bacon, 1 small teaspoonful
of minced savoury herbs, including parsley; a little onion, when liked, shredded very fine;
salt, nutmeg, and cayenne to taste; 4 oz. of bread crumbs, 1 egg.

Mode.--Mix all the ingredients well together, carefully mincing them very finely; beat up the
egg, moisten with it, and work the whole very smoothly together. Oysters or anchovies may be
added to this forcemeat, and will be found a great improvement.

Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient for a moderate-sized haddock or pike.

FORCEMEAT FOR VEAL, TURKEYS, FOWLS, HARE, &c.

417. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of ham or lean bacon, 1/4 lb. of suet, the rind of half a lemon, 1
teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced sweet herbs; salt, cayenne, and pounded
mace to taste; 6 oz. of bread crumbs, 2 eggs.

Mode.--Shred the ham or bacon, chop the suet, lemon-peel, and herbs, taking particular care
that all be very finely minced; add a seasoning to taste, of salt, cayenne, and mace, and blend
all thoroughly together with the bread crumbs, before wetting. Now beat and strain the eggs,
work these up with the other ingredients, and the forcemeat will be ready for use. When it
is made into balls, fry of a nice brown, in boiling lard, or put them on a tin and bake for
1/2 hour in a moderate oven. As we have stated before, no one flavour should predominate greatly,
and the forcemeat should be of sufficient body to cut with a knife, and yet not dry and heavy.
For very delicate forcemeat, it is advisable to pound the ingredients together before binding
with the egg; but for ordinary cooking, mincing very finely answers the purpose.

Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient for a turkey, a moderate-sized fillet of veal, or a hare.

Note.--In forcemeat for HARE, the liver of the animal is sometimes added. Boil for 5 minutes,
mince it very small, and mix it with the other ingredients. If it should be in an unsound state,
it must be on no account made use of.

    SWEET HERBS.--Those most usually employed for purposes of
    cooking, such as the flavouring of soups, sauces, forcemeats,
    &c., are thyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil. Other
    sweet herbs are cultivated for purposes of medicine and
    perfumery: they are most grateful both to the organs of taste
    and smelling; and to the aroma derived from them is due, in a
    great measure, the sweet and exhilarating fragrance of our
    "flowery meads." In town, sweet herbs have to be procured at the
    greengrocers' or herbalists', whilst, in the country, the garden
    should furnish all that are wanted, the cook taking great care
    to have some dried in the autumn for her use throughout the
    winter months.

FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED PIKE.

418. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of bread crumbs, 1 teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs, 8 oysters,
2 anchovies (these may be dispensed with), 2 oz. of suet; salt, pepper, and pounded mace to
taste; 6 tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, the yolks of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Beard and mince the oysters, prepare and mix the other ingredients by recipe No. 416,
and blend the whole thoroughly together. Moisten with the cream and eggs, put all into a stewpan,
and stir it over the fire till it thickens, when put it into the fish, which should have previously
been cut open, and sew it up.

Time.--4 or 6 minutes to thicken.

Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient for a moderate-sized pike.

FRENCH FORCEMEAT.

419. It will be well to state, in the beginning of this recipe, that French forcemeat, or quenelles,
consist of the blending of three separate processes; namely, panada, udder, and whatever meat
you intend using.

PANADA.

420. INGREDIENTS.--The crumb of 2 penny rolls, 4 tablespoonfuls of white stock, No. 107, 1
oz. of butter, 1 slice of ham, 1 bay-leaf, a little minced parsley, 2 shalots, 1 clove, 2 blades
of mace, a few mushrooms (when obtainable), butter, the yolks of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Soak the crumb of the rolls in milk for about 1/2 hour, then take it out, and squeeze
so as to press the milk from it; put the soaked bread into a stewpan with the above quantity
of white stock, and set it on one side; then put into a separate stewpan 1 oz. of butter, a
slice of lean ham cut small, with a bay-leaf, herbs, mushrooms, spices, &c., in the above proportions,
and fry them gently over a slow fire. When done, moisten with 2 teacupfuls of white stock,
boil for 20 minutes, and strain the whole through a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan.
Place it over the fire, keep constantly stirring, to prevent its burning, and when quite dry,
put in a small piece of butter. Let this again dry up by stirring over the fire; then add the
yolks of 2 eggs, mix well, put the panada to cool on a clean plate, and use it when required.
Panada should always be well flavoured, as the forcemeat receives no taste from any of the
other ingredients used in its preparation.

Boiled Calf's Udder for French Forcemeats.

421. Put the udder into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover it; let it stew gently till
quite done, when take it out to cool. Trim all the upper parts, cut it into small pieces, and
pound well in a mortar, till it can be rubbed through a sieve. That portion which passes through
the strainer is one of the three ingredients of which French forcemeats are generally composed;
but many cooks substitute butter for this, being a less troublesome and more expeditious mode
of preparation.

    PESTLE AND MORTAR.--No cookery can be perfectly performed
    without the aid of the useful instruments shown in the
    engraving. For pounding things sufficiently fine, they are
    invaluable, and the use of them will save a good deal of time,
    besides increasing the excellence of the preparations. They are
    made of iron, and, in that material, can be bought cheap; but as
    these are not available, for all purposes, we should recommend,
    as more economical in the end, those made of Wedgwood, although
    these are considerably more expensive than the former.

Veal Quenelles.

422. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of veal, panada (No. 420), and calf's udder (No. 421),
2 eggs; seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded mace, or grated nutmeg; a little flour.

Mode.--Take the fleshy part of veal, scrape it with a knife, till all the meat is separated
from the sinews, and allow about 1/2 lb. for an entrée. Chop the meat, and pound it in a mortar
till reduced to a paste; then roll it into a ball; make another of panada (No. 420), the same
size, and another of udder (No. 421), taking care that these three balls be of the same size.
It is to be remembered, that equality of size, and not of weight, is here necessary. When the
three ingredients are properly prepared, pound them altogether in a mortar for some time; for
the more quenelles are pounded, the more delicate they are. Now moisten with the eggs, whites
and yolks, and continue pounding, adding a seasoning of pepper, spices, &c. When the whole
is well blended together, mould it into balls, or whatever shape is intended, roll them in
flour, and poach in boiling water, to which a little salt should have been added. If the quenelles
are not firm enough, add the yolk of another egg, but omit the white, which only makes them
hollow and puffy inside. In the preparation of this recipe, it would be well to bear in mind
that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned, and must be made hard or soft according
to the dishes they are intended for. For brown or white ragoûts they should be firm, and when
the quenelles are used very small, extreme delicacy will be necessary in their preparation.
Their flavour may be varied by using the flesh of rabbit, fowl, hare, pheasant, grouse, or
an extra quantity of mushroom, parsley, &c.

Time,--About 1/4 hour to poach in boiling water.

Sufficient, 1/2 lb. of veal or other meat, with other ingredients in proportion, for 1 entrée.

Note.--The French are noted for their skill in making forcemeats; one of the principal causes
of their superiority in this respect being, that they pound all the ingredients so diligently
and thoroughly. Any one with the slightest pretensions to refined cookery, must, in this particular,
implicitly follow the example of our friends across the Channel.

FORCEMEAT, or QUENELLES, FOR TURTLE SOUP.

(See No. 189.)

423. SOYER'S RECIPE FOR FORCEMEATS.--Take a pound and a half of lean veal from the fillet,
and cut it in long thin slices; scrape with a knife till nothing but the fibre remains; put
it in a mortar, pound it 10 minutes, or until in a purée; pass it through a wire sieve (use
the remainder in stock); then take 1 pound of good fresh beef suet, which skin, shred, and
chop very fine; put it in a mortar and pound it; then add 6 oz. of panada (that is, bread soaked
in milk and boiled till nearly dry) with the suet; pound them well together, and add the veal;
season with a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter one of pepper, half that of nutmeg; work all well
together; then add four eggs by degrees, continually pounding the contents of the mortar. When
well mixed, take a small piece in a spoon, and poach it in some boiling water; and if it is
delicate, firm, and of a good flavour, it is ready for use.

FRIED BREAD CRUMBS.

424. Cut the bread into thin slices, place them in a cool oven overnight, and when thoroughly
dry and crisp, roll them down into fine crumbs. Put some lard, or clarified dripping, into
a frying-pan; bring it to the boiling-point, throw in the crumbs, and fry them very quickly.
Directly they are done, lift them out with a slice, and drain them before the fire from all
greasy moisture. When quite crisp, they are ready for use. The fat they are fried in should
be clear, and the crumbs should not have the slightest appearance or taste of having been,
in the least degree, burnt.

FRIED SIPPETS OF BREAD (for Garnishing many Dishes).

425. Cut the bread into thin slices, and stamp them out in whatever shape you like,--rings,
crosses, diamonds, &c. &c. Fry them in the same manner as the bread crumbs, in clear boiling
lard, or clarified dripping, and drain them until thoroughly crisp before the fire. When variety
is desired, fry some of a pale colour, and others of a darker hue.

FRIED BREAD FOR BORDERS.

426. Proceed as above, by frying some slices of bread cut in any fanciful shape. When quite
crisp, dip one side of the sippet into the beaten white of an egg mixed with a little flour,
and place it on the edge of the dish. Continue in this manner till the border is completed,
arranging the sippets a pale and a dark one alternately.

GENEVESE SAUCE FOR SALMON, TROUT, &c.

427.

Mode.--Cut up the onion and carrot into small rings, and put them into a stewpan with the herbs,
mushrooms, bay-leaf, cloves, and mace; add the butter, and simmer the whole very gently over
a slow fire until the onion is quite tender. Pour in the stock and sherry, and stew slowly
for 1 hour, when strain it off into a clean saucepan. Now make a thickening of butter and flour,
put it to the sauce, stir it over the fire until perfectly smooth and mellow, add the lemon-juice,
give one boil, when it will be ready for table.

Time.--Altogether 2 hours.

Average cost, 1s. 3d per pint.

Sufficient, half this quantity for two slices of salmon.

    SAGE.--This was originally a native of the south of Europe, but
    it has long been cultivated in the English garden. There are
    several kinds of it, known as the green, the red, the
    small-leaved, and the broad-leaved balsamic. In cookery, its
    principal use is for stuffings and sauces, for which purpose the
    red is the most agreeable, and the green the next. The others
    are used for medical purposes.

PICKLED GHERKINS.

428. INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, 1/2 oz. of whole black pepper,
1/4 oz. of whole allspice, 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, a little horseradish. This proportion
of pepper, spices, &c., for 1 quart of vinegar.

Mode.--Let the gherkins remain in salt and water for 3 or 4 days, when take them out, wipe
perfectly dry, and put them into a stone jar. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, with spices
and pepper, &c., in the above proportion, for 10 minutes; pour it, quite boiling, over the
gherkins, cover the jar with vine-leaves, and put over them a plate, setting them near the
fire, where they must remain all night. Next day drain off the vinegar, boil it up again, and
pour it hot over them. Cover up with fresh leaves, and let the whole remain till quite cold.
Now tie down closely with bladder to exclude the air, and in a month or two, they will be fit
for use.

Time.--4 days.

Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of August.

    GHERKINS.--Gherkins are young cucumbers; and the only way in
    which they are used for cooking purposes is pickling them, as by
    the recipe here given. Not having arrived at maturity, they have
    not, of course, so strongly a developed flavour as cucumbers,
    and, as a pickle, they are very general favourites.

GOOSEBERRY SAUCE FOR BOILED MACKEREL.

429. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of green gooseberries, 3 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel, No. 367 (veal
gravy may be substituted for this), 2 oz. of fresh butter; seasoning to taste of salt, pepper,
and grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Boil the gooseberries in water until quite tender; strain them, and rub them through
a sieve. Put into a saucepan the Béchamel or gravy, with the butter and seasoning; add the
pulp from the gooseberries, mix all well together, and heat gradually through. A little pounded
sugar added to this sauce is by many persons considered an improvement, as the saccharine matter
takes off the extreme acidity of the unripe fruit.

Time.--Boil the gooseberries from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.

Sufficient, this quantity, for a large dish of mackerel.

Seasonable from May to July.

    THE GOOSEBERRY.--This useful and wholesome fruit (Ribes
    grossularia) is thought to be indigenous to the British Isles,
    and may be occasionally found in a wild state in some of the
    eastern counties, although, when uncultivated, it is but a very
    small and inferior berry. The high state of perfection to which
    it has been here brought, is due to the skill of the English
    gardeners; for in no other country does it attain the same size
    and flavour. The humidity of the British climate, however, has
    doubtless something to do with the result; and it is said that
    gooseberries produced in Scotland as far north as Inverness, are
    of a very superior character. Malic and citric acid blended with
    sugar, produce the pleasant flavour of the gooseberry; and upon
    the proper development of these properties depends the success
    of all cooking operations with which they are connected.

GLAZE FOR COVERING COLD HAMS, TONGUES, &c.

430. INGREDIENTS.--Stock No. 104 or 107, doubling the quantity of meat in each.

Mode.--We may remark at the outset, that unless glaze is wanted in very large quantities, it
is seldom made expressly. Either of the stocks mentioned above, boiled down and reduced very
considerably, will be found to produce a very good glaze. Put the stock into a stewpan, over
a nice clear fire; let it boil till it becomes somewhat stiff, when keep stirring, to prevent
its burning. The moment it is sufficiently reduced, and comes to a glaze, turn it out into
the glaze-pot, of which we have here given an engraving. As, however, this is not to be found
in every establishment, a white earthenware jar would answer the purpose; and this may be placed
in a vessel of boiling water, to melt the glaze when required. It should never be warmed in
a saucepan, except on the principle of the bain marie, lest it should reduce too much, and
become black and bitter. If the glaze is wanted of a pale colour, more veal than beef should
be used in making the stock; and it is as well to omit turnips and celery, as these impart
a disagreeable bitter flavour.

TO GLAZE COLD JOINTS, &c.--Melt the glaze by placing the vessel which contains it, into the
bain marie or saucepan of boiling water; brush it over the meat with a paste-brush, and if
in places it is not quite covered, repeat the operation. The glaze should not be too dark a
colour. (See Coloured Cut of Glazed Ham, P.)

    GLAZE-KETTLE.--This is a kettle used for keeping the strong
    stock boiled down to a jelly, which is known by the name of
    glaze. It is composed of two tin vessels, as shown in the cut,
    one of which, the upper,--containing the glaze, is inserted into
    one of larger diameter and containing boiling water. A brush is
    put in the small hole at the top of the lid, and is employed for
    putting the glaze on anything that may require it.

    THE BAIN MARIE.--So long ago as the time when emperors ruled in
    Rome, and the yellow Tiber passed through a populous and wealthy
    city, this utensil was extensively employed; and it is
    frequently mentioned by that profound culinary chemist of the
    ancients, Apicius. It is an open kind of vessel (as shown in the
    engraving and explained in our paragraph No. 87, on the French
    terms used in modern cookery), filled with boiling or nearly
    boiling water; and into this water should be put all the
    stewpans containing those ingredients which it is desired to
    keep hot. The quantity and quality of the contents of these
    vessels are not at all affected; and if the hour of dinner is
    uncertain in any establishment, by reason of the nature of the
    master's business, nothing is so certain a means of preserving
    the flavour of all dishes as the employment of the bain marie.

GREEN SAUCE FOR GREEN GEESE OR DUCKLINGS.

431. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of sorrel-juice, 1 glass of sherry, 1/2 pint of green gooseberries,
1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 oz. of fresh butter.

Mode.--Boil the gooseberries in water until they are quite tender; mash them and press them
through a sieve; put the pulp into a saucepan with the above ingredients; simmer for 3 or 4
minutes, and serve very hot.

Time.--3 or 4 minutes.

Note.--We have given this recipe as a sauce for green geese, thinking that some of our readers
might sometimes require it; but, at the generality of fashionable tables, it is now seldom
or never served.

    SORREL.--We gather from the pages of Pliny and Apicius, that
    sorrel was cultivated by the Romans in order to give it more
    strength and flavour, and that they also partook of it sometimes
    stewed with mustard, being seasoned with a little oil and
    vinegar. At the present day, English cookery is not much
    indebted to this plant (Rumex Acetosa), although the French
    make use of it to a considerable extent. It is found in most
    parts of Great Britain, and also on the continent, growing wild
    in the grass meadows, and, in a few gardens, it is cultivated.
    The acid of sorrel is very prononcé, and is what chemists term
    a binoxalate of potash; that is, a combination of oxalic acid
    with potash.

GENERAL STOCK FOR GRAVIES.

432. Either of the stocks, Nos. 104, 105, or 107, will be found to answer very well for the
basis of many gravies, unless these are wanted very rich indeed. By the addition of various
store sauces, thickening and flavouring, the stocks here referred to may be converted into
very good gravies. It should be borne in mind, however, that the goodness and strength of spices,
wines, flavourings, &c., evaporate, and that they lose a great deal of their fragrance, if
added to the gravy a long time before they are wanted. If this point is attended to, a saving
of one half the quantity of these ingredients will be effected, as, with long boiling, the
flavour almost entirely passes away. The shank-bones of mutton, previously well soaked, will
be found a great assistance in enriching gravies; a kidney or melt, beef skirt, trimmings of
meat, &c. &c., answer very well when only a small quantity is wanted, and, as we have before
observed, a good gravy need not necessarily be so very expensive; for economically-prepared
dishes are oftentimes found as savoury and wholesome as dearer ones. The cook should also remember
that the fragrance of gravies should not be overpowered by too much spice, or any strong essences,
and that they should always be warmed in a bain marie, after they are flavoured, or else in
a jar or jug placed in a saucepan full of boiling water. The remains of roast-meat gravy should
always be saved; as, when no meat is at hand, a very nice gravy in haste may be made from it,
and when added to hashes, ragoûts, &c., is a great improvement.

    GRAVY-KETTLE.--This is a utensil which will not be found in
    every kitchen; but it is a useful one where it is necessary to
    keep gravies hot for the purpose of pouring over various dishes
    as they are cooking. It is made of copper, and should,
    consequently, be heated over the hot plate, if there be one, or
    a charcoal stove. The price at which it can be purchased is set
    down by Messrs. Slack at 14s.

GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT.

433. INGREDIENTS.--Gravy, salt.

Mode.--Put a common dish with a small quantity of salt in it under the meat, about a quarter
of an hour before it is removed from the fire. When the dish is full, take it away, baste the
meat, and pour the gravy into the dish on which the joint is to be served.

    SAUCES AND GRAVIES IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--Neither poultry,
    butcher's meat, nor roast game were eaten dry in the middle
    ages, any more than fried fish is now. Different sauces, each
    having its own peculiar flavour, were served with all these
    dishes, and even with the various parts of each animal.
    Strange and grotesque sauces, as, for example, "eggs cooked on
    the spit," "butter fried and roasted," were invented by the
    cooks of those days; but these preparations had hardly any other
    merit than that of being surprising and difficult to make.

A QUICKLY-MADE GRAVY.

434. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of shin of beef, 1/2 onion, 1/4 carrot, 2 or 3 sprigs of parsley
and savoury herbs, a piece of butter about the size of a walnut; cayenne and mace to taste,
3/4 pint of water.

Mode.--Cut up the meat into very small pieces, slice the onion and carrot, and put them into
a small saucepan with the butter. Keep stirring over a sharp fire until they have taken a little
colour, when add the water and the remaining ingredients. Simmer for 1/2 hour, skim well, strain,
and flavour, when it will be ready for use.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, for this quantity, 5d.

    A HUNDRED DIFFERENT DISHES.--Modern housewives know pretty well
    how much care, and attention, and foresight are necessary in
    order to serve well a little dinner for six or eight persons,--a
    dinner which will give credit to the ménage, and satisfaction
    and pleasure to the guests. A quickly-made gravy, under some
    circumstances that we have known occur, will be useful to many
    housekeepers when they have not much time for preparation. But,
    talking of speed, and time, and preparation, what a combination
    of all these must have been necessary for the feast at the
    wedding of Charles VI. of France. On that occasion, as Froissart
    the chronicler tells us, the art of cooking, with its
    innumerable paraphernalia of sauces, with gravy, pepper,
    cinnamon, garlic, scallion, brains, gravy soups, milk potage,
    and ragoûts, had a signal triumph. The skilful chef-de-cuisine
    of the royal household covered the great marble table of the
    regal palace with no less than a hundred different dishes,
    prepared in a hundred different ways.

A GOOD BEEF GRAVY FOR POULTRY, GAME, &c.

435. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of lean beef, 1/2 pint of cold water, 1 shalot or small onion, 1/2
a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, 1 tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce or mushroom ketchup,
1/2 a teaspoonful of arrowroot.

Mode.--Cut up the beef into small pieces, and put it, with the water, into a stewpan. Add the
shalot and seasoning, and simmer gently for 3 hours, taking care that it does not boil fast.
A short time before it is required, take the arrowroot, and having mixed it with a little cold
water, pour it into the gravy, which keep stirring, adding the Harvey's sauce, and just letting
it boil. Strain off the gravy in a tureen, and serve very hot.

Time.--3 hours. Average cost, 8d. per pint.

BROWN GRAVY.

436. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 2 large onions, 2 lbs. of shin of beef, 2 small slices
of lean bacon (if at hand), salt and whole pepper to taste, 3 cloves, 2 quarts of water. For
thickening, 2 oz. of butter, 3 oz. of flour.

Mode.--Put the butter into a stewpan; set this on the fire, throw in the onions cut in rings,
and fry them a light brown; then add the beef and bacon, which should be cut into small square
pieces; season, and pour in a teacupful of water; let it boil for about ten minutes, or until
it is of a nice brown colour, occasionally stirring the contents. Now fill up with water in
the above proportion; let it boil up, when draw it to the side of the fire to simmer very gently
for 1-1/2 hour; strain, and when cold, take off all the fat. In thickening this gravy, melt
3 oz. of butter in a stewpan, add 2 oz. of flour, and stir till of a light-brown colour; when
cold, add it to the strained gravy, and boil it up quickly. This thickening may be made in
larger quantities, and kept in a stone jar for use when wanted.

Time.--Altogether, 2 hours. Average cost, 4d. per pint.

    CLOVES.--This very agreeable spice is the unexpanded flower-buds
    of the Caryophyllus aromaticus, a handsome, branching tree, a
    native of the Malacca Islands. They take their name from the
    Latin word clavus, or the French clou, both meaning a nail,
    and to which the clove has a considerable resemblance. Cloves
    were but little known to the ancients, and Pliny appears to be
    the only writer who mentions them; and he says, vaguely enough,
    that some were brought to Rome, very similar to grains of
    pepper, but somewhat longer; that they were only to be found in
    India, in a wood consecrated to the gods; and that they served
    in the manufacture of perfumes. The Dutch, as in the case of the
    nutmeg (see 378), endeavoured, when they gained possession of
    the Spice Islands, to secure a monopoly of cloves, and, so that
    the cultivation of the tree might be confined to Amboyna, their
    chief island, bribed the surrounding chiefs to cut down all
    trees found elsewhere. The Amboyna, or royal clove, is said to
    be the best, and is rare; but other kinds, nearly equally good,
    are produced in other parts of the world, and they come to
    Europe from Mauritius, Bourbon, Cayenne, and Martinique, as also
    from St. Kitts, St. Vincent's, and Trinidad. The clove contains
    about 20 per cent. of volatile aromatic oil, to which it owes
    its peculiar pungent flavour, its other parts being composed of
    woody fibre, water, gum, and resin.

BROWN GRAVY WITHOUT MEAT.

437. INGREDIENTS.--2 large onions, 1 large carrot, 2 oz. of butter, 3 pints of boiling water,
1 bunch of savoury herbs, a wineglassful of good beer; salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Slice, flour, and fry the onions and carrots in the butter until of a nice light-brown
colour; then add the boiling water and the remaining ingredients; let the whole stew gently
for about an hour; then strain, and when cold, skim off all the fat. Thicken it in the same
manner as recipe No. 436, and, if thought necessary, add a few drops of colouring No. 108.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost, 2d. per pint.

Note.--The addition of a small quantity of mushroom ketchup or Harvey's sauce very much improves
the flavour of this gravy.

RICH GRAVY FOR HASHES, RAGOUTS, &c.

438. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of shin of beef, 1 large onion or a few shalots, a little flour,
a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades of mace, 2 or 3 cloves, 4 whole allspice, 1/4 teaspoonful
of whole pepper, 1 slice of lean ham or bacon, 1/2 a head of celery (when at hand), 2 pints
of boiling water; salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Cut the beef into thin slices, as also the onions, dredge them with flour, and fry of
a pale brown, but do not allow them to get black; pour in the boiling water, let it boil up;
and skim. Add the remaining ingredients, and simmer the whole very gently for 2 hours, or until
all the juices are extracted from the meat; put it by to get cold, when take off all the fat.
This gravy may be flavoured with ketchup, store sauces, wine, or, in fact, anything that may
give additional and suitable relish to the dish it is intended for.

Time.--Rather more than 2 hours.

Average cost, 8d. per pint.

    ALLSPICE.--This is the popular name given to pimento, or Jamaica
    pepper, known to naturalists as Eugenia pimenta, and belonging
    to the order of Myrtaceae. It is the berry of a fine tree in the
    West Indies and South America, which attains a height of from
    fifteen to twenty feet: the berries are not allowed to ripen,
    but, being gathered green, are then dried in the sun, and then
    become black. It is an inexpensive spice, and is considered more
    mild and innocent than most other spices; consequently, it is
    much used for domestic purposes, combining a very agreeable
    variety of flavours.

GRAVY MADE WITHOUT MEAT FOR FOWLS.

439. INGREDIENTS.--The necks, feet, livers, and gizzards of the fowls, 1 slice of toasted bread,
1/2 onion, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, 1/2 pint of water, thickening
of butter and flour, 1 dessertspoonful of ketchup.

Mode.--Wash the feet of the fowls thoroughly clean, and cut them and the neck into small pieces.
Put these into a stewpan with the bread, onion, herbs, seasoning, livers, and gizzards; pour
the water over them and simmer gently for 1 hour. Now take out the liver, pound it, and strain
the liquor to it. Add a thickening of butter and flour, and a flavouring of mushroom ketchup;
boil it up and serve.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost, 4d. per pint.

A CHEAP GRAVY FOR HASHES, &c.

440.

Mode.--Chop the bones in small pieces, and put them in a stewpan, with the trimmings, salt,
pepper, spice, herbs, and celery. Cover with boiling water, and let the whole simmer gently
for 1-1/2 or 2 hours. Slice and fry the onion in the butter till it is of a pale brown, and
mix it gradually with the gravy made from the bones; boil for  1/4 hour, and strain into a
basin; now put it back into the stewpan; flavour with walnut pickle or ketchup, pickled-onion
liquor, or any store sauce that may be preferred. Thicken with a little butter and flour, kneaded
together on a plate, and the gravy will be ready for use. After the thickening is added, the
gravy should just boil, to take off the rawness of the flour.

Time.--2 hours, or rather more.

Average cost, 4d., exclusive of the bones and trimmings.

JUGGED GRAVY (Excellent).

441.

Mode.--Cut up the beef and ham into small pieces, and slice the vegetables; take a jar, capable
of holding two pints of water, and arrange therein, in layers, the ham, meat, vegetables, and
seasoning, alternately, filling up with the above quantity of water; tie down the jar, or put
a plate over the top, so that the steam may not escape; place it in the oven, and let it remain
there from 6 to 8 hours; should, however, the oven be very hot, less time will be required.
When sufficiently cooked, strain the gravy, and when cold, remove the fat. It may be flavoured
with ketchup, wines, or any other store sauce that may be preferred.

It is a good plan to put the jar in a cool oven over-night, to draw the gravy; and then it
will not require so long baking the following day.

Time.--From 6 to 8 hours, according to the oven.

Average cost, 7d. per pint.

    CELERY.--As in the above recipe, the roots of celery are
    principally used in England for flavouring soups, sauces, and
    gravies, and for serving with cheese at the termination of a
    dinner, and as an ingredient for salad. In Italy, however, the
    green leaves and stems are also employed for stews and soups,
    and the seeds are also more frequently made use of on the
    continent than in our own islands. In Germany, celery is very
    highly esteemed; and it is there boiled and served up as a dish
    by itself, as well as used in the composition of mixed dishes.
    We ourselves think that this mild aromatic plant might oftener
    be cooked than it is; for there are very few nicer vegetable
    preparations brought to table than a well-dressed plate of
    stewed celery.

VEAL GRAVY FOR WHITE SAUCES, FRICASSEES, &c.

442. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of nicely flavoured lean ham, any poultry trimmings, 3 lbs. of
lean veal, a faggot of savoury herbs, including parsley, a few green onions (or 1 large onion
may be substituted for these), a few mushrooms, when obtainable; 1 blade of mace, salt to taste,
3 pints of water. When the bottom of the stewpan becomes covered with a white glaze, fill up
with water in the above proportion; add the remaining ingredients, stew very slowly for 3 or
4 hours, and do not forget to skim well the moment it boils. Put it by, and, when cold, take
off all the fat. This may be used for Béchamel, sauce tournée, and many other white sauces.

Time.--3 or 4 hours. Average cost, 9d. per pint.

CHEAP GRAVY FOR MINCED VEAL.

443. INGREDIENTS.--Bones and trimmings of cold roast or boiled veal, 1-1/2 pint of water, 1
onion, 1/4 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1/4 teaspoonful of salt, 1 blade of pounded mace,
the juice of 1/4 lemon; thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, except the thickening and lemon-juice, and let
them simmer very gently for rather more than 1 hour, or until the liquor is reduced to a pint,
when strain through a hair-sieve. Add a thickening of butter and flour, and the lemon-juice;
set it on the fire, and let it just boil up, when it will be ready for use. It may be flavoured
with a little tomato sauce, and, where a rather dark-coloured gravy is not objected to, ketchup,
or Harvey's sauce, may be added at pleasure.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour. Average cost, 3d.

GRAVY FOR VENISON.

444. INGREDIENTS.--Trimmings of venison, 3 or 4 mutton shank-bones, salt to taste, 1 pint of
water, 2 teaspoonfuls of walnut ketchup.

Mode.--Brown the trimmings over a nice clear fire, and put them in a stewpan with the shank-bones
and water; simmer gently for 2 hours, strain and skim, and add the walnut ketchup and a seasoning
of salt. Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve.

Time.--2 hours.

    VENISON.--Far, far away in ages past, our fathers loved the
    chase, and what it brought; and it is usually imagined that when
    Isaac ordered his son Esau to go out with his weapons, his
    quiver and his bow, and to prepare for him savoury meat, such as
    he loved, that it was venison he desired. The wise Solomon, too,
    delighted in this kind of fare; for we learn that, at his table,
    every day were served the wild ox, the roebuck, and the stag.
    Xenophon informs us, in his History, that Cyrus, king of Persia,
    ordered that venison should never be wanting at his repasts; and
    of the effeminate Greeks it was the delight. The Romans, also,
    were devoted admirers of the flesh of the deer; and our own
    kings and princes, from the Great Alfred down to the Prince
    Consort, have hunted, although, it must be confessed, under
    vastly different circumstances, the swift buck, and relished
    their "haunch" all the more keenly, that they had borne
    themselves bravely in the pursuit of the animal.

TO DRY HERBS FOR WINTER USE.

445. On a very dry day, gather the herbs, just before they begin to flower. If this is done
when the weather is damp, the herbs will not be so good a colour. (It is very necessary to
be particular in little matters like this, for trifles constitute perfection, and herbs nicely
dried will be found very acceptable when frost and snow are on the ground. It is hardly necessary,
however, to state that the flavour and fragrance of fresh herbs are incomparably finer.) They
should be perfectly freed from dirt and dust, and be divided into small bunches, with their
roots cut off. Dry them quickly in a very hot oven, or before the fire, as by this means most
of their flavour will be preserved, and be careful not to burn them; tie them up in paper bags,
and keep in a dry place. This is a very general way of preserving dried herbs; but we would
recommend the plan described in a former recipe.

Seasonable.--From the month of July to the end of September is the proper time for storing
herbs for winter use.

HERB POWDER FOR FLAVOURING, when Fresh Herbs are not obtainable.

446. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of dried lemon-thyme, 1 oz. of dried winter savory, 1 oz. of dried
sweet marjoram and basil, 2 oz. of dried parsley, 1 oz. of dried lemon-peel.

Mode.--Prepare and dry the herbs by recipe No. 445; pick the leaves from the stalks, pound
them, and sift them through a hair-sieve; mix in the above proportions, and keep in glass bottles,
carefully excluding the air. This, we think, a far better method of keeping herbs, as the flavour
and fragrance do not evaporate so much as when they are merely put in paper bags. Preparing
them in this way, you have them ready for use at a moment's notice.

Mint, sage, parsley, &c., dried, pounded, and each put into separate bottles, will be found
very useful in winter.

    CORKS WITH WOODEN TOPS.--These are the best corks to use when it
    is indispensable that the air should not be admitted to the
    ingredients contained in bottles which are in constant use. The
    top, which, as will be seen by the accompanying little cut, is
    larger than the cork, is made of wood; and, besides effectually
    covering the whole top of the bottle, can be easily removed and
    again used, as no corkscrew is necessary to pull it out.

    SAVORY.--This we find described by Columella, a voluminous Roman
    writer on agriculture, as an odoriferous herb, which, "in the
    brave days of old," entered into the seasoning of nearly every
    dish. Verily, there are but few new things under the sun, and we
    don't find that we have made many discoveries in gastronomy, at
    least beyond what was known to the ancient inhabitants of Italy.
    We possess two varieties of this aromatic herb, known to
    naturalists as Satureja. They are called summer and winter
    savory, according to the time of the year when they are fit for
    gathering. Both sorts are in general cultivation throughout
    England.

HORSERADISH SAUCE, to serve with Roast Beef.

447. INGREDIENTS.--4 tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar,
1 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of made mustard; vinegar.

Mode.--Grate the horseradish, and mix it well with the sugar, salt, pepper, and mustard; moisten
it with sufficient vinegar to give it the consistency of cream, and serve in a tureen: 3 or
4 tablespoonfuls of cream added to the above, very much improve the appearance and flavour
of this sauce. To heat it to serve with hot roast beef, put it in a bain marie or a jar, which
place in a saucepan of boiling water; make it hot, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.

Note.--This sauce is a great improvement on the old-fashioned way of serving cold-scraped horseradish
with hot roast beef. The mixing of the cold vinegar with the warm gravy cools and spoils everything
on the plate. Of course, with cold meat, the sauce should be served cold.

    THE HORSERADISH.--This has been, for many years, a favourite
    accompaniment of roast beef, and is a native of England. It
    grows wild in wet ground, but has long been cultivated in the
    garden, and is, occasionally, used in winter salads and in
    sauces. On account of the great volatility of its oil, it should
    never be preserved by drying, but should be kept moist by being
    buried in sand. So rapidly does its volatile oil evaporate, that
    even when scraped for the table, it almost immediately spoils by
    exposure to the air.

HORSERADISH VINEGAR.

448. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of scraped horseradish, 1 oz. of minced shalot, 1 drachm of cayenne,
1 quart of vinegar.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a bottle, which shake well every day for a fortnight. When
it is thoroughly steeped, strain and bottle, and it will be fit for use immediately. This will
be found an agreeable relish to cold beef, &c.

Seasonable.--This vinegar should be made either in October or November, as horseradish is then
in its highest perfection.

INDIAN CURRY-POWDER, founded on Dr. Kitchener's Recipe.

449. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of coriander-seed, 1/4 lb. of turmeric, 2 oz. of cinnamon-seed,
1/2 oz. of cayenne, 1 oz. of mustard, 1 oz. of ground ginger, 1/2 ounce of allspice, 2 oz.
of fenugreek-seed.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients in a cool oven, where they should remain one night; then pound
them in a mortar, rub them through a sieve, and mix thoroughly together; keep the powder in
a bottle, from which the air should be completely excluded.

Note.--We have given this recipe for curry-powder, as some persons prefer to make it at home;
but that purchased at any respectable shop is, generally speaking, far superior, and, taking
all things into consideration, very frequently more economical.

INDIAN MUSTARD, an excellent Relish to Bread and Butter, or any cold Meat.

450. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of the best mustard, 1/4 lb. of flour, 1/2 oz. of salt, 4 shalots,
4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 4 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 1/4 bottle of anchovy sauce.

Mode.--Put the mustard, flour, and salt into a basin, and make them into a stiff paste with
boiling water. Boil the shalots with the vinegar, ketchup, and anchovy sauce, for 10 minutes,
and pour the whole, boiling, over the mixture in the basin; stir well, and reduce it to a proper
thickness; put it into a bottle, with a bruised shalot at the bottom, and store away for use.
This makes an excellent relish, and if properly prepared will keep for years.

    MUSTARD.--Before the year 1729, mustard was not known at English
    tables. About that time an old woman, of the name of Clements,
    residing in Durham, began to grind the seed in a mill, and to
    pass the flour through several processes necessary to free the
    seed from its husks. She kept her secret for many years to
    herself, during which she sold large quantities of mustard
    throughout the country, but especially in London. Here it was
    introduced to the royal table, when it received the approval of
    George I. From the circumstance of Mrs. Clements being a
    resident at Durham, it obtained the name of Durham mustard. In
    the county of that name it is still principally cultivated, and
    the plant is remarkable for the rapidity of its growth. It is
    the best stimulant employed to impart strength to the digestive
    organs, and even in its previously coarsely-pounded state, had a
    high reputation with our ancestors.

INDIAN PICKLE (very Superior).

451. INGREDIENTS.--To each gallon of vinegar allow 6 cloves of garlic, 12 shalots, 2 sticks
of sliced horseradish, 1/4 lb. of bruised ginger, 2 oz. of whole black pepper, 1 oz. of long
pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, 12 cloves, 1/4 oz. of cayenne, 2 oz. of mustard-seed, 1/4 lb. of
mustard, 1 oz. of turmeric; a white cabbage, cauliflowers, radish-pods, French beans, gherkins,
small round pickling-onions, nasturtiums, capsicums, chilies, &c.

Mode.--Cut the cabbage, which must be hard and white, into slices, and the cauliflowers into
small branches; sprinkle salt over them in a large dish, and let them remain two days; then
dry them, and put them into a very large jar, with garlic, shalots, horseradish, ginger, pepper,
allspice, and cloves, in the above proportions. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, which
pour over, and, when cold, cover up to keep them free from dust. As the other things for the
pickle ripen at different times, they may be added as they are ready: these will be radish-pods,
French beans, gherkins, small onions, nasturtiums, capsicums, chilies, &c. &c. As these are
procured, they must, first of all, be washed in a little cold vinegar, wiped, and then simply
added to the other ingredients in the large jar, only taking care that they are covered by
the vinegar. If more vinegar should be wanted to add to the pickle, do not omit first to boil
it before adding it to the rest. When you have collected all the things you require, turn all
out in a large pan, and thoroughly mix them. Now put the mixed vegetables into smaller jars,
without any of the vinegar; then boil the vinegar again, adding as much more as will be required
to fill the different jars, and also cayenne, mustard-seed, turmeric, and mustard, which must
be well mixed with a little cold vinegar, allowing the quantities named above to each gallon
of vinegar. Pour the vinegar, boiling hot, over the pickle, and when cold, tie down with a
bladder. If the pickle is wanted for immediate use, the vinegar should be boiled twice more,
but the better way is to make it during one season for use during the next. It will keep for
years, if care is taken that the vegetables are quite covered by the vinegar.

This recipe was taken from the directions of a lady whose pickle was always pronounced excellent
by all who tasted it, and who has, for many years, exactly followed the recipe given above.

Note.--For small families, perhaps the above quantity of pickle will be considered too large;
but this may be decreased at pleasure, taking care to properly proportion the various ingredients.

    KEEPING PICKLES.--Nothing shows more, perhaps, the difference
    between a tidy thrifty housewife and a lady to whom these
    desirable epithets may not honestly be applied, than the
    appearance of their respective store-closets. The former is
    able, the moment anything; is wanted, to put her hand on it at
    once; no time is lost, no vexation incurred, no dish spoilt for
    the want of "just little something,"--the latter, on the
    contrary, hunts all over her cupboard for the ketchup the cook
    requires, or the pickle the husband thinks he should like a
    little of with his cold roast beef or mutton-chop, and vainly
    seeks for the Embden groats, or arrowroot, to make one of her
    little boys some gruel. One plan, then, we strenuously advise
    all who do not follow, to begin at once, and that is, to label
    all their various pickles and store sauces, in the same way as
    the cut here shows. It will occupy a little time at first, but
    there will be economy of it in the long run.

    VINEGAR.--This term is derived from the two French words vin
    aigre, 'sour wine,' and should, therefore, be strictly applied
    to that which is made only from wine. As the acid is the same,
    however it is procured, that made from ale also takes the same
    name. Nearly all ancient nations were acquainted with the use of
    vinegar. We learn in Ruth, that the reapers in the East soaked
    their bread in it to freshen it. The Romans kept large
    quantities of it in their cellars, using it, to a great extent,
    in their seasonings and sauces. This people attributed very
    beneficial qualities to it, as it was supposed to be digestive,
    antibilious, and antiscorbutic, as well as refreshing.
    Spartianus, a Latin historian, tells us that, mixed with water,
    it was the drink of the soldiers, and that, thanks to this
    beverage, the veterans of the Roman army braved, by its use, the
    inclemency and variety of all the different seasons and climates
    of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is said, the Spanish peasantry,
    and other inhabitants of the southern parts of Europe, still
    follow this practice, and add to a gallon of water about a gill
    of wine vinegar, with a little salt; and that this drink, with a
    little bread, enables them, under the heat of their burning sun,
    to sustain the labours of the field.

INDIAN CHETNEY SAUCE.

452. INGREDIENTS.--8 oz. of sharp, sour apples, pared and cored; 8 oz. of tomatoes, 8 oz. of
salt, 8 oz. of brown, sugar, 8 oz. of stoned raisins, 4 oz. of cayenne, 4 oz. of powdered ginger,
2 oz. of garlic, 2 oz. of shalots, 3 quarts of vinegar, 1 quart of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Chop the apples in small square pieces, and add to them the other ingredients. Mix the
whole well together, and put in a well-covered jar. Keep this in a warm place, and stir every
day for a month, taking care to put on the lid after this operation; strain, but do not squeeze
it dry; store it away in clean jars or bottles for use, and the liquor will serve as an excellent
sauce for meat or fish.

Seasonable.--Make this sauce when tomatoes are in full season, that is, from the beginning
of September to the end of October.

    PICKLES.--The ancient Greeks and Romans held their pickles in
    high estimation. They consisted of flowers, herbs, roots, and
    vegetables, preserved in vinegar, and which were kept, for a
    long time, in cylindrical vases with wide mouths. Their cooks
    prepared pickles with the greatest care, and the various
    ingredients were macerated in oil, brine, and vinegar, with
    which they were often impregnated drop by drop. Meat, also,
    after having been cut into very small pieces, was treated in the
    same manner.

ITALIAN SAUCE (Brown).

453. INGREDIENTS.--A few chopped mushrooms and shalots, 1/2 pint of stock, No. 105, 1/2 glass
of Madeira, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of chopped
parsley.

Mode.--Put the stock into a stewpan with the mushrooms, shalots, and Madeira, and stew gently
for 1/4 hour, then add the remaining ingredients, and let them just boil. When the sauce is
done enough, put it in another stewpan, and warm it in a bain marie. (See No. 430.) The mushrooms
should not be chopped long before they are wanted, as they will then become black.

Time.--1/4 hour. Average cost, for this quantity, 7d.

Sufficient for a small dish.

ITALIAN SAUCE (White).

454. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107; 2 tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms,
1 dessertspoonful of chopped shalots, 1 slice of ham, minced very fine; 1/4 pint of Béchamel,
No. 367; salt to taste, a few drops of garlic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, a
squeeze of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Put the shalots and mushrooms into a stewpan with the stock and ham, and simmer very
gently for 1/2 hour, when add the Béchamel. Let it just boil up, and then strain it through
a tammy; season with the above ingredients, and serve very hot. If this sauce should not have
retained a nice white colour, a little cream may be added.

Sufficient for a moderate-sized dish.

Note.--To preserve the colour of the mushrooms after pickling, throw them into water to which
a little lemon-juice has been added.

TO PICKLE LEMONS WITH THE PEEL ON.

455. INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 2 quarts of boiling water; to each quart of vinegar allow 1/2
oz. of cloves, 1/2 oz. of white pepper, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, 1/4 oz. of mace and chilies,
1 oz. of mustard-seed, 1/2 stick of sliced horseradish, a few cloves of garlic.

Mode.--Put the lemons into a brine that will bear an egg; let them remain in it 6 days, stirring
them every day; have ready 2 quarts of boiling water, put in the lemons, and allow them to
boil for 1/4 hour; take them out, and let them lie in a cloth until perfectly dry and cold.
Boil up sufficient vinegar to cover the lemons, with all the above ingredients, allowing the
same proportion as stated to each quart of vinegar. Pack the lemons in a jar, pour over the
vinegar, &c. boiling hot, and tie down with a bladder. They will be fit for use in about 12
months, or rather sooner.

Seasonable.--This should be made from November to April.

    THE LEMON.--In the earlier ages of the world, the lemon does not
    appear to have been at all known, and the Romans only became
    acquainted with it at a very late period, and then only used it
    to keep moths from their garments. Its acidity would seem to
    have been unpleasant to them; and in Pliny's time, at the
    commencement of the Christian era, this fruit was hardly
    accepted, otherwise than as an excellent antidote against the
    effects of poison. Many anecdotes have been related concerning
    the anti-venomous properties of the lemon; Athenaeus, a Latin
    writer, telling us, that on one occasion, two men felt no
    effects from the bites of dangerous serpents, because they had
    previously eaten of this fruit.

TO PICKLE LEMONS WITHOUT THE PEEL.

456. INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 1 lb. of fine salt; to each quart of vinegar, the same ingredients
as No. 455.

Mode.--Peel the lemons, slit each one down 3 times, so as not to divide them, and rub the salt
well into the divisions; place them in a pan, where they must remain for a week, turning them
every other day; then put them in a Dutch oven before a clear fire until the salt has become
perfectly dry; then arrange them in a jar. Pour over sufficient boiling vinegar to cover them,
to which have been added the ingredients mentioned in the foregoing recipe; tie down closely,
and in about 9 months they will be fit for use.

Seasonable.--The best time to make this is from November to April.

Note.--After this pickle has been made from 4 to 5 months, the liquor may be strained and bottled,
and will be found an excellent lemon ketchup.

    LEMON-JUICE.--Citric acid is the principal component part of
    lemon-juice, which, in addition to the agreeableness of its
    flavour, is also particularly cooling and grateful. It is
    likewise an antiscorbutic; and this quality enhances its value.
    In order to combat the fatal effects of scurvy amongst the crews
    of ships at sea, a regular allowance of lemon-juice is served
    out to the men; and by this practice, the disease has almost
    entirely disappeared. By putting the juice into bottles, and
    pouring on the top sufficient oil to cover it, it may be
    preserved for a considerable time. Italy and Turkey export great
    quantities of it in this manner.

LEMON SAUCE FOR BOILED FOWLS.

457. INGREDIENTS.--1 small lemon, 3/4 pint of melted butter, No. 380.

Mode.--Cut the lemon into very thin slices, and these again into very small dice. Have ready
3/4 pint of melted butter, made by recipe No. 380; put in the lemon; let it just simmer, but
not boil, and pour it over the fowls.

Time.--1 minute to simmer. Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient for a pair of large fowls.

LEMON WHITE SAUCE, FOR FOWLS, FRICASSEES, &c.

458. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 pint of cream, the rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole
white pepper, 1 sprig of lemon thyme, 3 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 teacupful
of white stock; salt to taste.

Mode.--Put the cream into a very clean saucepan (a lined one is best), with the lemon-peel,
pepper, and thyme, and let these infuse for 1/2 hour, when simmer gently for a few minutes,
or until there is a nice flavour of lemon. Strain it, and add a thickening of butter and flour
in the above proportions; stir this well in, and put in the lemon-juice at the moment of serving;
mix the stock with the cream, and add a little salt. This sauce should not boil after the cream
and stock are mixed together.

Time.--Altogether, 3/4 hour. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient, this quantity, for a pair of large boiled fowls.

Note.--Where the expense of the cream is objected to, milk may be substituted for it. In this
case, an additional dessertspoonful, or rather more, of flour must be added.

    LEMON THYME.--Two or three tufts of this species of thyme,
    Thymus citriodorus, usually find a place in the herb
    compartment of the kitchen-garden. It is a trailing evergreen,
    is of smaller growth than the common kind (see No. 166), and
    is remarkable for its smell, which closely resembles that of the
    rind of a lemon. Hence its distinctive name. It is used for some
    particular dishes, in which the fragrance of the lemon is
    desired to slightly predominate.

LEAMINGTON SAUCE (an Excellent Sauce for Flavouring Gravies, Hashes, Soups, &c.).

(Author's Recipe.)

459. INGREDIENTS.--Walnuts. To each quart of walnut-juice allow 3 quarts of vinegar, 1 pint
of Indian soy, 1 oz. of cayenne, 2 oz. of shalots, 3/4 oz. of garlic, 1/2 pint of port wine.

Mode.--Be very particular in choosing the walnuts as soon as they appear in the market; for
they are more easily bruised before they become hard and shelled. Pound them in a mortar to
a pulp, strew some salt over them, and let them remain thus for two or three days, occasionally
stirring and moving them about. Press out the juice, and to each quart of walnut-liquor allow
the above proportion of vinegar, soy, cayenne, shalots, garlic, and port wine. Pound each ingredient
separately in a mortar, then mix them well together, and store away for use in small bottles.
The corks should be well sealed.

Seasonable.--This sauce should be made as soon as walnuts are obtainable, from the beginning
to the middle of July.

LEMON BRANDY.

460. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of brandy, the rind of two small lemons, 2 oz. of loaf-sugar, 1/4
pint of water.

Mode.--Peel the lemons rather thin, taking care to have none of the white pith. Put the rinds
into a bottle with the brandy, and let them infuse for 24 hours, when they should be strained.
Now boil the sugar with the water for a few minutes, skim it, and, when cold, add it to the
brandy. A dessertspoonful of this will be found an excellent flavouring for boiled custards.

    LEMON RIND OR PEEL.--This contains an essential oil of a very
    high flavour and fragrance, and is consequently esteemed both a
    wholesome and agreeable stomachic. It is used, as will be seen
    by many recipes in this book, as an ingredient for flavouring a
    number of various dishes. Under the name of CANDIED LEMON-PEEL,
    it is cleared of the pulp and preserved by sugar, when it
    becomes an excellent sweetmeat. By the ancient medical
    philosopher Galen, and others, it may be added, that dried
    lemon-peel was considered as one of the best digestives, and
    recommended to weak and delicate persons.

LIAISON OF EGGS FOR THICKENING SAUCES.

461. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 3 eggs, 8 tablespoonfuls of milk or cream.

Mode.--Beat up the yolks of the eggs, to which add the milk, and strain the whole through a
hair-sieve. When the liaison is being added to the sauce it is intended to thicken, care must
be exercised to keep stirring it during the whole time, or, otherwise, the eggs will curdle.
It should only just simmer, but not boil.

LIVER AND LEMON SAUCE FOR POULTRY.

462. INGREDIENTS.--The liver of a fowl, one lemon, salt to taste, 1/2 pint of melted butter.
No. 376.

Mode.--Wash the liver, and let it boil for a few minutes; peel the lemon very thin, remove
the white part and pips, and cut it into very small dice; mince the liver and a small quantity
of the lemon rind very fine; add these ingredients to 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter;
season with a little salt, put in the cut lemon, heat it gradually, but do not allow it to
boil, lest the butter should oil.

Time.--1 minute to simmer.

Sufficient to serve with a pair of small fowls.

LIVER AND PARSLEY SAUCE FOR POULTRY.

463.

Time.--1 minute to simmer.

Sufficient for a pair of small fowls.

LOBSTER SAUCE, to serve with Turbot, Salmon, Brill, &c.

(Very Good.)

464. INGREDIENTS.--1 middling-sized hen lobster, 3/4 pint of melted butter, No. 376; 1 tablespoonful
of anchovy sauce, 1/2 oz. of butter, salt and cayenne to taste, a little pounded mace when
liked, 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of cream.

Mode.--Choose a hen lobster, as this is indispensable, in order to render this sauce as good
as it ought to be. Pick the meat from the shells, and cut it into small square pieces; put
the spawn, which will be found under the tail of the lobster, into a mortar with 1/2 oz. of
butter, and pound it quite smooth; rub it through a hair-sieve, and cover up till wanted. Make
3/4 pint of melted butter by recipe No. 376; put in all the ingredients except the lobster-meat,
and well mix the sauce before the lobster is added to it, as it should retain its square form,
and not come to table shredded and ragged. Put in the meat, let it get thoroughly hot, but
do not allow it to boil, as the colour would immediately be spoiled; for it should be remembered
that this sauce should always have a bright red appearance. If it is intended to be served
with turbot or brill, a little of the spawn (dried and rubbed through a sieve without butter)
should be saved to garnish with; but as the goodness, flavour, and appearance of the sauce
so much depend on having a proper quantity of spawn, the less used for garnishing the better.

Time.--1 minute to simmer. Average cost, for this quantity, 2s.

Seasonable at any time.

Sufficient to serve with a small turbot, a brill, or salmon for 6 persons.

Note.--Melted butter made with milk, No. 380, will be found to answer very well for lobster
sauce, as by employing it a nice white colour will be obtained. Less quantity than the above
may be made by using a very small lobster, to which add only 1/2 pint of melted butter, and
season as above. Where economy is desired, the cream may be dispensed with, and the remains
of a cold lobster left from table, may, with a little care, be converted into a very good sauce.

MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER, for putting into Broiled Fish just before it is sent to Table.

465. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 2 dessertspoonfuls of minced parsley, salt and pepper
to taste, the juice of 1 large lemon.

Mode.--Work the above ingredients well together, and let them be thoroughly mixed with a wooden
spoon. If this is used as a sauce, it may be poured either under or over the meat or fish it
is intended to be served with.

Average cost, for this quantity, 5d.

Note.--4 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel, No. 367, 2 do. of white stock, No. 107, with 2 oz. of
the above maître d'hôtel butter stirred into it, and just allowed to simmer for 1 minute, will
be found an excellent hot maître d'hôtel sauce.

    THE MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL.--The house-steward of England is synonymous
    with the maître d'hôtel of France; and, in ancient times,
    amongst the Latins, he was called procurator, or major-domo. In
    Rome, the slaves, after they had procured the various articles
    necessary for the repasts of the day, would return to the
    spacious kitchen laden with meat, game, sea-fish, vegetables,
    fruit, &c. Each one would then lay his basket at the feet of the
    major-domo, who would examine its contents and register them on
    his tablets, placing in the pantry contiguous to the
    dining-room, those of the provisions which need no preparation,
    and consigning the others to the more immediate care of the
    cooks.

MAITRE D'HOTEL SAUCE (HOT), to serve with Calf's Head, Boiled Eels, and different Fish.

466. INGREDIENTS.--1 slice of minced ham, a few poultry-trimmings, 2 shalots, 1 clove of garlic,
1 bay-leaf, 3/4 pint of water, 2 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 heaped tablespoonful
of chopped parsley; salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste; the juice of 1/2 large lemon, 1/4 teaspoonful
of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Put at the bottom of a stewpan the minced ham, and over it the poultry-trimmings (if
these are not at hand, veal should be substituted), with the shalots, garlic, and bay-leaf.
Pour in the water, and let the whole simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the liquor is reduced
to a full 1/2 pint. Then strain this gravy, put it in another saucepan, make a thickening of
butter and flour in the above proportions, and stir it to the gravy over a nice clear fire,
until it is perfectly smooth and rather thick, care being taken that the butter does not float
on the surface. Skim well, add the remaining ingredients, let the sauce gradually heat, but
do not allow it to boil. If this sauce is intended for an entrée, it is necessary to make it
of a sufficient thickness, so that it may adhere to what it is meant to cover. 2d. per pint.

Sufficient for re-warming the remains of 1/2 calf's head, or a small dish of cold flaked turbot,
cod, &c.

MAIGRE MAITRE D'HOTEL SAUCE (HOT).

(Made without Meat.)

467.

MAYONNAISE, a Sauce or Salad-Dressing for cold Chicken, Meat, and other cold Dishes.

468. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 2 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of
vinegar, salt and white pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful of white stock, No. 107, 2 tablespoonfuls
of cream.

Mode.--Put the yolks of the eggs into a basin, with a seasoning of pepper and salt; have ready
the above quantities of oil and vinegar, in separate vessels; add them very gradually to the
eggs; continue stirring and rubbing the mixture with a wooden spoon, as herein consists the
secret of having a nice smooth sauce. It cannot be stirred too frequently, and it should be
made in a very cool place, or, if ice is at hand, it should be mixed over it. When the vinegar
and oil are well incorporated with the eggs, add the stock and cream, stirring all the time,
and it will then be ready for use.

For a fish Mayonnaise, this sauce may be coloured with lobster-spawn, pounded; and for poultry
or meat, where variety is desired, a little parsley-juice may be used to add to its appearance.
Cucumber, Tarragon, or any other flavoured vinegar, may be substituted for plain, where they
are liked.

Average cost, for this quantity, 7d.

Sufficient for a small salad.

Note.--In mixing the oil and vinegar with the eggs, put in first a few drops of oil, and then
a few drops of vinegar, never adding a large quantity of either at one time. By this means,
you can be more certain of the sauce not curdling. Patience and practice, let us add, are two
essentials for making this sauce good.

MINT SAUCE, to serve with Roast Lamb.

469. INGREDIENTS.--4 dessertspoonfuls of chopped mint, 2 dessertspoonfuls of pounded white
sugar, 1/4 pint of vinegar.

Mode.--Wash the mint, which should be young and fresh-gathered, free from grit; pick the leaves
from the stalks, mince them very fine, and put them into a tureen; add the sugar and vinegar,
and stir till the former is dissolved. This sauce is better by being made 2 or 3 hours before
wanted for table, as the vinegar then becomes impregnated with the flavour of the mint. By
many persons, the above proportion of sugar would not be considered sufficient; but as tastes
vary, we have given the quantity which we have found to suit the general palate.

Average cost, 3d.

Sufficient to serve with a middling-sized joint of lamb.

Note.--Where green mint is scarce and not obtainable, mint vinegar may be substituted for it,
and will be found very acceptable in early spring.

    MINT.--The common mint cultivated in our gardens is known as the
    Mentha viridis, and is employed in different culinary
    processes, being sometimes boiled with certain dishes, and
    afterwards withdrawn. It has an agreeable aromatic flavour, and
    forms an ingredient in soups, and sometimes is used in spring
    salads. It is valuable as a stomachic and antispasmodic; on
    which account it is generally served at table with pea-soup.
    Several of its species grow wild in low situations in the
    country.

MINT VINEGAR.

470. INGREDIENTS.--Vinegar, mint.

Mode.--Procure some nice fresh mint, pick the leaves from the stalks, and fill a bottle or
jar with them. Add vinegar to them until the bottle is full; cover closely to exclude the air,
and let it infuse for a fortnight. Then strain the liquor, and put it into small bottles for
use, of which the corks should be sealed.

Seasonable.--This should be made in June, July, or August.

MIXED PICKLE.

(Very Good.)

471. INGREDIENTS.--To each gallon of vinegar allow 1/4 lb. of bruised ginger, 1/4 lb. of mustard,
1/4 lb. of salt, 2 oz. of mustard-seed, 1-1/2 oz. of turmeric, 1 oz. of ground black pepper,
1/4 oz. of cayenne, cauliflowers, onions, celery, sliced cucumbers, gherkins, French beans,
nasturtiums, capsicums.

Mode.--Have a large jar, with a tightly-fitting lid, in which put as much vinegar as required,
reserving a little to mix the various powders to a smooth paste. Put into a basin the mustard,
turmeric, pepper, and cayenne; mix them with vinegar, and stir well until no lumps remain;
add all the ingredients to the vinegar, and mix well. Keep this liquor in a warm place, and
thoroughly stir every morning for a month with a wooden spoon, when it will be ready for the
different vegetables to be added to it. As these come into season, have them gathered on a
dry day, and, after merely wiping them with a cloth, to free them from moisture, put them into
the pickle. The cauliflowers, it may be said, must be divided into small bunches. Put all these
into the pickle raw, and at the end of the season, when there have been added as many of the
vegetables as could be procured, store it away in jars, and tie over with bladder. As none
of the ingredients are boiled, this pickle will not be fit to eat till 12 months have elapsed.
Whilst the pickle is being made, keep a wooden spoon tied to the jar; and its contents, it
may be repeated, must be stirred every morning.

Seasonable.--Make the pickle-liquor in May or June, as the season arrives for the various vegetables
to be picked.

MUSHROOM KETCHUP.

472. INGREDIENTS.--To each peck of mushrooms 1/2 lb. of salt; to each quart of mushroom-liquor
1/4 oz. of cayenne, 1/2 oz. of allspice, 1/2 oz. of ginger, 2 blades of pounded mace.

Mode.--Choose full-grown mushroom-flaps, and take care they are perfectly fresh-gathered when
the weather is tolerably dry; for, if they are picked during very heavy rain, the ketchup from
which they are made is liable to get musty, and will not keep long. Put a layer of them in
a deep pan, sprinkle salt over them, and then another layer of mushrooms, and so on alternately.
Let them remain for a few hours, when break them up with the hand; put them in a nice cool
place for 3 days, occasionally stirring and mashing them well, to extract from them as much
juice as possible. Now measure the quantity of liquor without straining, and to each quart
allow the above proportion of spices, &c. Put all into a stone jar, cover it up very closely,
put it in a saucepan of boiling water, set it over the fire, and let it boil for 3 hours. Have
ready a nice clean stewpan; turn into it the contents of the jar, and let the whole simmer
very gently for 1/2 hour; pour it into a jug, where it should stand in a cool place till the
next day; then pour it off into another jug, and strain it into very dry clean bottles, and
do not squeeze the mushrooms. To each pint of ketchup add a few drops of brandy. Be careful
not to shake the contents, but leave all the sediment behind in the jug; cork well, and either
seal or rosin the cork, so as perfectly to exclude the air. When a very clear bright ketchup
is wanted, the liquor must be strained through a very fine hair-sieve, or flannel bag, after
it has been very gently poured off; if the operation is not successful, it must be repeated
until you have quite a clear liquor. It should be examined occasionally, and if it is spoiling,
should be reboiled with a few peppercorns.

Seasonable from the beginning of September to the middle of October, when this ketchup should
be made.

Note.--This flavouring ingredient, if genuine and well prepared, is one of the most useful
store sauces to the experienced cook, and no trouble should be spared in its preparation. Double
ketchup is made by reducing the liquor to half the quantity; for example, 1 quart must be boiled
down to 1 pint. This goes farther than ordinary ketchup, as so little is required to flavour
a good quantity of gravy. The sediment may also be bottled for immediate use, and will be found
to answer for flavouring thick soups or gravies.

    HOW TO DISTINGUISH MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS.--The cultivated
    mushroom, known as Agaricus campestris, may be distinguished
    from other poisonous kinds of fungi by its having pink or
    flesh-coloured gills, or under-side, and by its invariably
    having an agreeable smell, which the toadstool has not. When
    young, mushrooms are like a small round button, both the stalk
    and head being white. As they grow larger, they expand their
    heads by degrees into a flat form, the gills underneath being at
    first of a pale flesh-colour, but becoming, as they stand
    longer, dark brown or blackish. Nearly all the poisonous kinds
    are brown, and have in general a rank and putrid smell. Edible
    mushrooms are found in closely-fed pastures, but seldom grow in
    woods, where most of the poisonous sorts are to be found.

TO DRY MUSHROOMS.

473. Mode.--Wipe them clean, take away the brown part, and peel off the skin; lay them on sheets
of paper to dry, in a cool oven, when they will shrivel considerably. Keep them in paper bags,
which hang in a dry place. When wanted for use, put them into cold gravy, bring them gradually
to simmer, and it will be found that they will regain nearly their usual size.

    THE MUSHROOM.--The cultivated or garden mushroom is a species of
    fungus, which, in England, is considered the best, and is there
    usually eaten. The tribe, however, is numerous, and a large
    proportion of them are poisonous; hence it is always dangerous
    to make use of mushrooms gathered in their wild state. In some
    parts of Europe, as in Germany, Russia, and Poland, many species
    grow wild, and are used as food; but in Britain, two only are
    generally eaten. These are mostly employed for the flavouring of
    dishes, and are also dried and pickled. CATSUP, or KETCHUP, is
    made from them by mixing spices and salt with their juice. The
    young, called buttons, are the best for pickling when in the
    globular form.

BROWN MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Roast Meat, &c.

474. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of button mushrooms, 1/2 pint of good beef gravy, No. 435, 1 tablespoonful
of mushroom ketchup (if at hand), thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Put the gravy into a saucepan, thicken it, and stir over the fire until it boils. Prepare
the mushrooms by cutting off the stalks and wiping them free from grit and dirt; the large
flap mushrooms cut into small pieces will answer for a brown sauce, when the buttons are not
obtainable; put them into the gravy, and let them simmer very gently for about 10 minutes;
then add the ketchup, and serve.

Time.--Rather more than 10 minutes.

Seasonable from August to October.

Note.--When fresh mushrooms are not obtainable, the powder No. 477 may be used as a substitute
for brown sauce.

WHITE MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Boiled Fowls, Cutlets, &c.

I.

475. INGREDIENTS.--Rather more than 1/2 pint of button mushrooms, lemon-juice and water, 1
oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of Béchamel, No. 367, 1/4 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Turn the mushrooms white by putting them into lemon-juice and water, having previously
cut off the stalks and wiped them perfectly free from grit. Chop them, and put them in a stewpan
with the butter. When the mushrooms are softened, add the Béchamel, and simmer for about 5
minutes; should they, however, not be done enough, allow rather more time. They should not
boil longer than necessary, as they would then lose their colour and flavour. Rub the whole
through a tammy, and serve very hot. After this, it should be warmed in a bain marie.

Time.--Altogether, 1/4 hour. Average cost, 1s.

Seasonable from August to October.

II.

A More Simple Method.

476.

Mode.--Make the melted butter by recipe No. 380, and add to it the mushrooms, which must be
nicely cleaned, and free from grit, and the stalks cut off. Let them simmer gently for about
10 minutes, or until they are quite tender. Put in the seasoning and ketchup; let it just boil,
when serve.

Time.--Rather more than 10 minutes. Average cost, 8d.

Seasonable from August to October.

    GROWTH OF THE MUSHROOM AND OTHER FUNGI.--The quick growth of the
    mushroom and other fungi is no less wonderful than the length of
    time they live, and the numerous dangers they resist while they
    continue in the dormant state. To spring up "like a mushroom in
    a night" is a scriptural mode of expressing celerity; and this
    completely accords with all the observations which have been
    made concerning this curious class of plants. Mr. Sowerby
    remarks--"I have often placed specimens of the Phallus caninus
    by a window over-night, while in the egg-form, and they have
    been fully grown by the morning."

MUSHROOM POWDER (a valuable addition to Sauces and Gravies, when fresh Mushrooms are not obtainable).

477. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 peck of large mushrooms, 2 onions, 12 cloves, 1/4 oz. of pounded mace,
2 teaspoonfuls of white pepper.

Mode.--Peel the mushrooms, wipe them perfectly free from grit and dirt, remove the black fur,
and reject all those that are at all worm-eaten; put them into a stewpan with the above ingredients,
but without water; shake them over a clear fire, till all the liquor is dried up, and be careful
not to let them burn; arrange them on tins, and dry them in a slow oven; pound them to a fine
powder, which put into small dry bottles; cork well, seal the corks, and keep it in a dry place.
In using this powder, add it to the gravy just before serving, when it will merely require
one boil-up. The flavour imparted by this means to the gravy, ought to be exceedingly good.

Seasonable.--This should be made in September, or at the beginning of October.

Note.--If the bottles in which it is stored away are not perfectly dry, as, also the mushroom
powder, it will keep good but a very short time.

PICKLED MUSHROOMS.

478. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms; to each quart of mushrooms, 2
blades of pounded mace, 1 oz. of ground pepper, salt to taste.

Mode.--Choose some nice young button mushrooms for pickling, and rub off the skin with a piece
of flannel and salt, and cut off the stalks; if very large, take out the red inside, and reject
the black ones, as they are too old. Put them in a stewpan, sprinkle salt over them, with pounded
mace and pepper in the above proportion; shake them well over a clear fire until the liquor
flows, and keep them there until it is all dried up again; then add as much vinegar as will
cover them; just let it simmer for 1 minute, and store it away in stone jars for use. When
cold, tie down with bladder and keep in a dry place; they will remain good for a length of
time, and are generally considered delicious.

Seasonable.--Make this the same time as ketchup, from the beginning of September to the middle
of October.

    NATURE OF THE MUSHROOM.--Locality has evidently a considerable
    influence on the nature of the juices of the mushroom; for it
    has been discovered, after fatal experience, that some species,
    which are perfectly harmless when raised in open meadows and
    pasturelands, become virulently poisonous when they happen to
    grow in contact with stagnant water or putrescent animal and
    vegetable substances. What the precise nature of the poison in
    fungi may be, has not been accurately ascertained.

A VERY RICH AND GOOD MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Fowls or Rabbits.

479. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of mushroom-buttons, salt to taste, a little grated nutmeg, 1 blade
of pounded mace, 1 pint of cream, 2 oz. of butter, flour to thicken.

Mode.--Rub the buttons with a piece of flannel and salt, to take off the skin; cut off the
stalks, and put them in a stewpan with the above ingredients, previously kneading together
the butter and flour; boil the whole for about ten minutes, stirring all the time. Pour some
of the sauce over the fowls, and the remainder serve in a tureen.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, 2s.

Sufficient to serve with a pair of fowls.

Seasonable from August to October.

HOW TO MIX MUSTARD.

480. INGREDIENTS.--Mustard, salt, and water.

Mode.--Mustard should be mixed with water that has been boiled and allowed to cool; hot water
destroys its essential properties, and raw cold water might cause it to ferment. Put the mustard
in a cup, with a small pinch of salt, and mix with it very gradually sufficient boiled water
to make it drop from the spoon without being watery. Stir and mix well, and rub the lumps well
down with the back of a spoon, as well-mixed mustard should be perfectly free from these. The
mustard-pot should not be more than half full, or rather less if it will not be used in a day
or two, as it is so much better when freshly mixed.

TARTAR MUSTARD.

481. INGREDIENTS.--Horseradish vinegar, cayenne, 1/2 a teacupful of mustard.

Mode.--Have ready sufficient horseradish vinegar to mix with the above proportion of mustard;
put the mustard in a cup, with a slight seasoning of cayenne; mix it perfectly smooth with
the vinegar, adding this a little at a time; rub down with the back of a spoon any lumps that
may appear, and do not let it be too thin. Mustard may be flavoured in various ways, with Tarragon,
shalot, celery, and many other vinegars, herbs, spices, &c.; but this is more customary in
France than in England, as there it is merely considered a "vehicle of flavours," as it has
been termed.

PICKLED NASTURTIUMS (a very good Substitute for Capers)

482. INGREDIENTS.--To each pint of vinegar, 1 oz. of salt, 6 peppercorns, nasturtiums.

Mode.--Gather the nasturtium-pods on a dry day, and wipe them clean with a cloth; put them
in a dry glass bottle, with vinegar, salt, and pepper in the above proportion. If you cannot
find enough ripe to fill a bottle, cork up what you have got until you have some more fit:
they may be added from day to day. Bung up the bottles, and seal or rosin the tops. They will
be fit for use in 10 or 12 months; and the best way is to make them one season for the next.

Seasonable.--Look for nasturtium-pods from the end of July to the end of August.

    NASTURTIUMS.--The elegant nasturtium-plant, called by
    naturalists Tropoeolum, and which sometimes goes by the name
    of Indian cress, came originally from Peru, but was easily made
    to grow in these islands. Its young leaves and flowers are of a
    slightly hot nature, and many consider them a good adjunct to
    salads, to which they certainly add a pretty appearance. When
    the beautiful blossoms, which may be employed with great effect
    in garnishing dishes, are off, then the fruit is used as
    described in the above recipe.

FRENCH ONION SAUCE, or SOUBISE.

483. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of Béchamel, No. 367, 1 bay-leaf, seasoning to taste of pounded
mace and cayenne, 6 onions, a small piece of ham.

Mode.--Peel the onions and cut them in halves; put them in a stewpan, with just sufficient
water to cover them, and add the bay-leaf, ham, cayenne, and mace; be careful to keep the lid
closely shut, and simmer them until tender. Take them out and drain thoroughly; rub them through
a tammy or sieve (an old one does for the purpose) with a wooden spoon, and put them to 1/2
pint of Béchamel; keep stirring over the fire until it boils, when serve. If it should require
any more seasoning, add it to taste.

Time.--3/4 hour to boil the onions.

Average cost, 10d. for this quantity.

Sufficient for a moderate-sized dish.

WHITE ONION SAUCE, for Boiled Rabbits, Roast Shoulder of Mutton, &c.

484.

Mode.--Peel the onions and put them into water to which a little salt has been added, to preserve
their whiteness, and let them remain for 1/4 hour. Then put them in a stewpan, cover them with
water, and let them boil until tender, and, if the onions should be very strong, change the
water after they have been boiling for 1/4 hour. Drain them thoroughly, chop them, and rub
them through a tammy or sieve. Make 1 pint of melted butter, by recipe No. 380, and when that
boils, put in the onions, with a seasoning of salt; stir it till it simmers, when it will be
ready to serve. If these directions are carefully attended to, this onion sauce will be delicious.

Time.--From 3/4 to 1 hour, to boil the onions.

Average cost, 9d. per pint.

Sufficient to serve with a roast shoulder of mutton, or boiled rabbit.

Seasonable from August to March.

Note.--To make this sauce very mild and delicate, use Spanish onions, which can be procured
from the beginning of September to Christmas. 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of cream added just before
serving, will be found to improve its appearance very much. Small onions, when very young,
may be cooked whole, and served in melted butter. A sieve or tammy should be kept expressly
for onions: an old one answers the purpose, as it is liable to retain the flavour and smell,
which of course would be excessively disagreeable in delicate preparations.

BROWN ONION SAUCE.

485. INGREDIENTS.--6 large onions, rather more than 1/2 pint of good gravy, 2 oz. of butter,
salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown in a stewpan, with the above quantity of butter,
keeping them well stirred, that they do not get black. When a nice colour, pour over the gravy,
and let them simmer gently until tender. Now skim off every particle of fat, add the seasoning,
and rub the whole through a tammy or sieve; put it back in the saucepan to warm, and when it
boils, serve.

Time.--Altogether 1 hour.

Seasonable from August to March.

Note.--Where a very high flavouring is liked, add 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, or a
small quantity of port wine.

    HISTORY OF THE ONION.--It is not supposed that any variety of
    the onion is indigenous to Britain, as when the large and mild
    roots imported from warmer climates, have been cultivated in
    these islands a few years, they deteriorate both in size and
    sweetness. It is therefore most likely that this plant was first
    introduced into England from continental Europe, and that it
    originally was produced in a southern climate, and has gradually
    become acclimatized to a colder atmosphere. (See No. 139.)

PICKLED ONIONS (a very Simple Method, and exceedingly Good).

486. INGREDIENTS.--Pickling onions; to each quart of vinegar, 2 teaspoonfuls of allspice, 2
teaspoonfuls of whole black pepper.

Mode.--Have the onions gathered when quite dry and ripe, and, with the fingers, take off the
thin outside skin; then, with a silver knife (steel should not be used, as it spoils the colour
of the onions), remove one more skin, when the onion will look quite clear. Have ready some
very dry bottles or jars, and as fast as they are peeled, put them in. Pour over sufficient
cold vinegar to cover them, with pepper and allspice in the above proportions, taking care
that each jar has its share of the latter ingredients. Tie down with bladder, and put them
in a dry place, and in a fortnight they will be fit for use. This is a most simple recipe and
very delicious, the onions being nice and crisp. They should be eaten within 6 or 8 months
after being done, as the onions are liable to become soft.

Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of August.

PICKLED ONIONS.

487. INGREDIENTS.--1 gallon of pickling onions, salt and water, milk; to each 1/2 gallon of
vinegar, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, 1/4 teaspoonful of cayenne, 1 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of whole
black pepper, 1/4 oz. of whole nutmeg bruised, 8 cloves, 1/4 oz. of mace.

Mode.--Gather the onions, which should not be too small, when they are quite dry and ripe;
wipe off the dirt, but do not pare them; make a strong solution of salt and water, into which
put the onions, and change this, morning and night, for 3 days, and save the last brine they
were put in. Then take the outside skin off, and put them into a tin saucepan capable of holding
them all, as they are always better done together. Now take equal quantities of milk and the
last salt and water the onions were in, and pour this to them; to this add 2 large spoonfuls
of salt, put them over the fire, and watch them very attentively. Keep constantly turning the
onions about with a wooden skimmer, those at the bottom to the top, and vice versâ; and let
the milk and water run through the holes of the skimmer. Remember, the onions must never boil,
or, if they do, they will be good for nothing; and they should be quite transparent. Keep the
onions stirred for a few minutes, and, in stirring them, be particular not to break them. Then
have ready a pan with a colander, into which turn the onions to drain, covering them with a
cloth to keep in the steam. Place on a table an old cloth, 2 or 3 times double; put the onions
on it when quite hot, and over them an old piece of blanket; cover this closely over them,
to keep in the steam. Let them remain till the next day, when they will be quite cold, and
look yellow and shrivelled; take off the shrivelled skins, when they should be as white as
snow. Put them in a pan, make a pickle of vinegar and the remaining ingredients, boil all these
up, and pour hot over the onions in the pan. Cover very closely to keep in all the steam, and
let them stand till the following day, when they will be quite cold. Put them into jars or
bottles well bunged, and a tablespoonful of the best olive-oil on the top of each jar or bottle.
Tie them down with bladder, and let them stand in a cool place for a month or six weeks, when
they will be fit for use. They should be beautifully white, and eat crisp, without the least
softness, and will keep good many months.

Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of August.

ORANGE GRAVY, for Wildfowl, Widgeon, Teal, &c.

488. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107, 1 small onion, 3 or 4 strips of lemon
or orange peel, a few leaves of basil, if at hand, the juice of a Seville orange or lemon,
salt and pepper to taste, 1 glass of port wine.

Mode.--Put the onion, cut in slices, into a stewpan with the stock, orange-peel, and basil,
and let them simmer very gently for 1/4 hour or rather longer, should the gravy not taste sufficiently
of the peel. Strain it off, and add to the gravy the remaining ingredients; let the whole heat
through, and, when on the point of boiling, serve very hot in a tureen which should have a
cover to it.

Time.--Altogether 1/2 hour.

Sufficient for a small tureen.

OYSTER FORCEMEAT, for Roast or Boiled Turkey.

489. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of bread crumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of chopped suet or butter, 1 faggot
of savoury herbs, 1/4 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 2 eggs, 18 oysters.

Mode.--Grate the bread very fine, and be careful that no large lumps remain; put it into a
basin with the suet, which must be very finely minced, or, when butter is used, that must be
cut up into small pieces. Add the herbs, also chopped as small as possible, and seasoning;
mix all these well together, until the ingredients are thoroughly mingled. Open and beard the
oysters, chop them, but not too small, and add them to the other ingredients. Beat up the eggs,
and, with the hand, work altogether, until it is smoothly mixed. The turkey should not be stuffed
too full: if there should be too much forcemeat, roll it into balls, fry them, and use them
as a garnish.

Sufficient for 1 turkey.

OYSTER KETCHUP.

490. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient oysters to fill a pint measure, 1 pint of sherry, 3 oz. of salt,
1 drachm of cayenne, 2 drachms of pounded mace.

Mode.--Procure the oysters very fresh, and open sufficient to fill a pint measure; save the
liquor, and scald the oysters in it with the sherry; strain the oysters, and put them in a
mortar with the salt, cayenne, and mace; pound the whole until reduced to a pulp, then add
it to the liquor in which they were scalded; boil it again five minutes, and skim well; rub
the whole through a sieve, and, when cold, bottle and cork closely. The corks should be sealed.

Seasonable from September to April.

Note.--Cider may be substituted for the sherry.

PICKLED OYSTERS.

491. INGREDIENTS.--100 oysters; to each 1/2 pint of vinegar, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 strip
of lemon-peel, 12 black peppercorns.

Mode.--Get the oysters in good condition, open them, place them in a saucepan, and let them
simmer in their own liquor for about 10 minutes, very gently; then take them out, one by one,
and place them in a jar, and cover them, when cold, with a pickle made as follows:--Measure
the oyster-liquor; add to it the same quantity of vinegar, with mace, lemon-peel, and pepper
in the above proportion, and boil it for 5 minutes; when cold, pour over the oysters, and tie
them down very closely, as contact with the air spoils them.

Seasonable from September to April.

Note.--Put this pickle away in small jars; because directly one is opened, its contents should
immediately be eaten, as they soon spoil. The pickle should not be kept more than 2 or 3 months.

OYSTER SAUCE, to serve with Fish, Boiled Poultry, &c.

492. Take them off the fire immediately, and put the whole into a basin. Strain the liquor
from them, mix with it sufficient milk to make 1/2 pint altogether, and follow the directions
of No. 380. When the melted butter is ready and very smooth, put in the oysters, which should
be previously bearded, if you wish the sauce to be really nice. Set it by the side of the fire
to get thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to boil, or the oysters will immediately harden.
Using cream instead of milk makes this sauce extremely delicious. When liked, add a seasoning
of cayenne, or anchovy sauce; but, as we have before stated, a plain sauce should be plain,
and not be overpowered by highly-flavoured essences; therefore we recommend that the above
directions be implicitly followed, and no seasoning added.

Average cost for this quantity, 2s.

Sufficient for 6 persons. Never allow fewer than 6 oysters to 1 person, unless the party is
very large.

Seasonable from September to April.

A more economical sauce may be made by using a smaller quantity of oysters, and not bearding
them before they are added to the sauce: this may answer the purpose, but we cannot undertake
to recommend it as a mode of making this delicious adjunct to fish, &c.

PARSLEY AND BUTTER, to serve with Calf's Head. Boiled Fowls, &c.

493.

Time.--5 minutes to boil the parsley. Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient for 1 large fowl; allow rather more for a pair.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Sometimes, in the middle of winter, parsley-leaves are not to be had, when the following
will be found an excellent substitute:--Tie up a little parsley-seed in a small piece of muslin,
and boil it for 10 minutes in a small quantity of water; use this water to make the melted
butter with, and throw into it a little boiled spinach, minced rather fine, which will have
an appearance similar to that of parsley.

    PARSLEY.--If there be nothing new under the sun, there are, at
    any rate, different uses found for the same thing; for this
    pretty aromatic herb was used in ancient times, as we learn from
    mythological narrative, to adorn the head of a hero, no less
    than Hercules; and now--was ever fall so great?--we moderns use
    it in connection with the head of--a calf. According to Homer's
    "Iliad," warriors fed their chariot-steeds on parsley; and Pliny
    acquaints us with the fact that, as a symbol of mourning, it was
    admitted to furnish the funeral tables of the Romans. Egypt,
    some say, first produced this herb; thence it was introduced, by
    some unknown voyager, into Sardinia, where the Carthaginians
    found it, and made it known to the inhabitants of Marseilles.
    (See No. 123.)

FRIED PARSLEY, for Garnishing.

494. INGREDIENTS.--Parsley, hot lard or clarified dripping.

Mode.--Gather some young parsley; wash, pick, and dry it thoroughly in a cloth; put it into
the wire basket of which we have given an engraving, and hold it in boiling lard or dripping
for a minute or two. Directly it is done, lift out the basket, and let it stand before the
fire, that the parsley may become thoroughly crisp; and the quicker it is fried the better.
Should the kitchen not be furnished with the above article, throw the parsley into the frying-pan,
and when crisp, lift it out with a slice, dry it before the fire, and when thoroughly crisp,
it will be ready for use.

    WIRE BASKET.--For this recipe, a wire basket, as shown in the
    annexed engraving, will be found very useful. It is very light
    and handy, and may be used for other similar purposes besides
    that described above.

PARSLEY JUICE, for Colouring various Dishes.

495. Procure some nice young parsley; wash it and dry it thoroughly in a cloth; pound the leaves
in a mortar till all the juice is extracted, and put the juice in a teacup or small jar; place
this in a saucepan of boiling water, and warm it on the bain marie principle just long enough
to take off its rawness; let it drain, and it will be ready for colouring.

TO PRESERVE PARSLEY THROUGH THE WINTER.

496. Use freshly-gathered parsley for keeping, and wash it perfectly free from grit and dirt;
put it into boiling water which has been slightly salted and well skimmed, and then let it
boil for 2 or 3 minutes; take it out, let it drain, and lay it on a sieve in front of the fire,
when it should be dried as expeditiously as possible. Store it away in a very dry place in
bottles, and when wanted for use, pour over it a little warm water, and let it stand for about
5 minutes.

Seasonable.--This may be done at any time between June and October.

AN EXCELLENT PICKLE.

497. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of medium-sized onions, cucumbers, and sauce-apples; 1-1/2
teaspoonful of salt, 3/4 teaspoonful of cayenne, 1 wineglassful of soy, 1 wineglassful of sherry;
vinegar.

Mode.--Slice sufficient cucumbers, onions, and apples to fill a pint stone jar, taking care
to cut the slices very thin; arrange them in alternate layers, shaking in as you proceed salt
and cayenne in the above proportion; pour in the soy and wine, and fill up with vinegar. It
will be fit for use the day it is made.

Seasonable in August and September.

[This recipe was forwarded to the editress of this work by a subscriber to the "Englishwoman's
Domestic Magazine." Mrs. Beeton, not having tested it, cannot vouch for its excellence; but
the contributor spoke very highly in its favour.]

    SOY.--This is a sauce frequently made use of for fish, and comes
    from Japan, where it is prepared from the seeds of a plant
    called Dolichos Soja. The Chinese also manufacture it; but
    that made by the Japanese is said to be the best. All sorts of
    statements have been made respecting the very general
    adulteration of this article in England, and we fear that many
    of them are too true. When genuine, it is of an agreeable
    flavour, thick, and of a clear brown colour.

PICKLED RED CABBAGE.

498. INGREDIENTS.--Red cabbages, salt and water; to each quart of vinegar, 1/2 oz. of ginger
well bruised, 1 oz. of whole black pepper, and, when liked, a little cayenne.

Mode.--Take off the outside decayed leaves of a nice red cabbage, cut it in quarters, remove
the stalks, and cut it across in very thin slices. Lay these on a dish, and strew them plentifully
with salt, covering them with another dish. Let them remain for 24 hours, turn into a colander
to drain, and, if necessary, wipe lightly with a clean soft cloth. Put them in a jar; boil
up the vinegar with spices in the above proportion, and, when cold, pour it over the cabbage.
It will be fit for use in a week or two, and, if kept for a very long time, the cabbage is
liable get soft and to discolour. To be really nice and crisp, and of a good red colour, it
should be eaten almost immediately after it is made. A little bruised cochineal boiled with
the vinegar adds much to the appearance of this pickle. Tie down with bladder, and keep in
a dry place.

Seasonable in July and August, but the pickle will be much more crisp if the frost has just
touched the leaves.

    RED CABBAGE.--This plant, in its growth, is similar in form to
    that of the white, but is of a bluish-purple colour, which,
    however, turns red on the application of acid, as is the case
    with all vegetable blues. It is principally from the white
    vegetable that the Germans make their sauer kraut; a dish held
    in such high estimation with the inhabitants of Vaderland, but
    which requires, generally speaking, with strangers, a long
    acquaintance in order to become sufficiently impressed with its
    numerous merits. The large red Dutch is the kind generally
    recommended for pickling.

PLUM-PUDDING SAUCE.

499. INGREDIENTS.--1 wineglassful of brandy, 2 oz. of very fresh butter, 1 glass of Madeira,
pounded sugar to taste.

Mode.--Put the pounded sugar in a basin, with part of the brandy and the butter; let it stand
by the side of the fire until it is warm and the sugar and butter are dissolved; then add the
rest of the brandy, with the Madeira. Either pour it over the pudding, or serve in a tureen.
This is a very rich and excellent sauce.

Average cost, 1s. 3d. for this quantity.

Sufficient for a pudding made for 6 persons.

QUIN'S SAUCE, an excellent Fish Sauce.

500. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of walnut pickle, 1/2 pint of port wine, 1 pint of mushroom ketchup,
1 dozen anchovies, 1 dozen shalots, 1/4 pint of soy, 1/2 teaspoonful of cayenne.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, having previously chopped the shalots and anchovies
very small; simmer for 15 minutes, strain, and, when cold, bottle off for use: the corks should
be well sealed to exclude the air.

Time.--1/4 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

RAVIGOTTE, a French Salad Sauce.

Mons. Ude's Recipe.

501. INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 teaspoonful of cavice, 1 teaspoonful
of Chili vinegar, 1 teaspoonful of Reading sauce, a piece of butter the size of an egg, 3 tablespoonfuls
of thick Béchamel, No. 367, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream; salt
and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Scald the parsley, mince the leaves very fine, and add it to all the other ingredients;
after mixing the whole together thoroughly, the sauce will be ready for use.

Average cost, for this quantity, 10d.

Seasonable at any time.

READING SAUCE.

502. INGREDIENTS.--2-1/2 pints of walnut pickle, 1-1/2 oz. of shalots, 1 quart of spring water,
3/4 pint of Indian soy, 1/2 oz. of bruised ginger, 1/2 oz. of long pepper, 1 oz. of mustard-seed,
1 anchovy, 1/2 oz. of cayenne, 1/4 oz. of dried sweet bay-leaves.

Mode.--Bruise the shalots in a mortar, and put them in a stone jar with the walnut-liquor;
place it before the fire, and let it boil until reduced to 2 pints. Then, into another jar,
put all the ingredients except the bay-leaves, taking care that they are well bruised, so that
the flavour may be thoroughly extracted; put this also before the fire, and let it boil for
1 hour, or rather more. When the contents of both jars are sufficiently cooked, mix them together,
stirring them well as you mix them, and submit them to a slow boiling for 1/2 hour; cover closely,
and let them stand 24 hours in a cool place; then open the jar and add the bay-leaves; let
it stand a week longer closed down, when strain through a flannel bag, and it will be ready
for use. The above quantities will make 1/2 gallon.

Time.--Altogether, 3 hours.

Seasonable.--This sauce may be made at any time.

REMOULADE, or FRENCH SALAD-DRESSING.

503. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/2 tablespoonful of made mustard, salt and cayenne to taste, 3
tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, 1 tablespoonful of tarragon or plain vinegar.

Mode.--Boil 3 eggs quite hard for about 1/4 hour, put them into cold water, and let them remain
in it for a few minutes; strip off the shells, put the yolks in a mortar, and pound them very
smoothly; add to them, very gradually, the mustard, seasoning, and vinegar, keeping all well
stirred and rubbed down with the back of a wooden spoon. Put in the oil drop by drop, and when
this is thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients, add the yolk of a raw egg, and stir well,
when it will be ready for use. This sauce should not be curdled; and to prevent this, the only
way is to mix a little of everything at a time, and not to cease stirring. The quantities of
oil and vinegar may be increased or diminished according to taste, as many persons would prefer
a smaller proportion of the former ingredient.

GREEN REMOULADE is made by using tarragon vinegar instead of plain, and colouring with a little
parsley-juice, No. 495. Harvey's sauce, or Chili vinegar, may be added at pleasure.

Time.--1/4 hour to boil the eggs.

Average cost, for this quantity, 7d.

Sufficient for a salad made for 4 or 6 persons.

    TARRAGON.--The leaves of this plant, known to naturalists as
    Artemisia dracunculus, are much used in France as a flavouring
    ingredient for salads. From it also is made the vinegar known as
    tarragon vinegar, which is employed by the French in mixing
    their mustard. It originally comes from Tartary, and does not
    seed in France.

SAGE-AND-ONION STUFFING, for Geese, Ducks, and Pork.

504. INGREDIENTS.--4 large onions, 10 sage-leaves, 1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter,
salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.

Mode.--Peel the onions, put them into boiling water, let them simmer for 5 minutes or rather
longer, and, just before they are taken out, put in the sage-leaves for a minute or two to
take off their rawness. Chop both these very fine, add the bread, seasoning, and butter, and
work the whole together with the yolk of an egg, when the stuffing will be ready for use. It
should be rather highly seasoned, and the sage-leaves should be very finely chopped. Many cooks
do not parboil the onions in the manner just stated, but merely use them raw. The stuffing
then, however, is not nearly so mild, and, to many tastes, its strong flavour would be very
objectionable. When made for goose, a portion of the liver of the bird, simmered for a few
minutes and very finely minced, is frequently added to this stuffing; and where economy is
studied, the egg may be dispensed with.

Time.--Rather more than 5 minutes to simmer the onions.

Average cost, for this quantity, 4d.

Sufficient for 1 goose, or a pair of ducks.

505. SOYER'S RECIPE FOR GOOSE STUFFING.--Take 4 apples, peeled and cored, 4 onions, 4 leaves
of sage, and 4 leaves of lemon thyme not broken, and boil them in a stewpan with sufficient
water to cover them; when done, pulp them through a sieve, removing the sage and thyme; then
add sufficient pulp of mealy potatoes to cause it to be sufficiently dry without sticking to
the hand; add pepper and salt, and stuff the bird.

SALAD DRESSING (Excellent).

I.

506. INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls
of salad oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, cayenne and salt to taste.

Mode.--Put the mixed mustard into a salad-bowl with the sugar, and add the oil drop by drop,
carefully stirring and mixing all these ingredients well together. Proceed in this manner with
the milk and vinegar, which must be added very gradually, or the sauce will curdle. Put in
the seasoning, when the mixture will be ready for use. If this dressing is properly made, it
will have a soft creamy appearance, and will be found very delicious with crab, or cold fried
fish (the latter cut into dice), as well as with salads. In mixing salad dressings, the ingredients
cannot be added too gradually, or stirred too much.

Average cost, for this quantity, 3d.

Sufficient for a small salad.

This recipe can be confidently recommended by the editress, to whom it
was given by an intimate friend noted for her salads. We further learn,
    that Queen Catharine herself, with all her royalty, could not
    procure a salad of English growth for her dinner. The king was
    obliged to mend this sad state of affairs, and send to Holland
    for a gardener in order to cultivate those pot-herbs, in the
    growth of which England is now, perhaps, not behind any other
    country in Europe.

    THE OLIVE AND OLIVE OIL.--This tree assumes a high degree of
    interest from the historical circumstances with which it is
    connected. A leaf of it was brought into the ark by the dove,
    when that vessel was still floating on the waters of the great
    deep, and gave the first token that the deluge was subsiding.
    Among the Greeks, the prize of the victor in the Olympic games
    was a wreath of wild olive; and the "Mount of Olives" is
    rendered familiar to our ears by its being mentioned in the
    Scriptures as near to Jerusalem. The tree is indigenous in the
    north of Africa, Syria, and Greece; and the Romans introduced it
    to Italy. In Spain and the south of France it is now cultivated;
    and although it grows in England, its fruit does not ripen in
    the open air. Both in Greece and Portugal the fruit is eaten in
    its ripe state; but its taste is not agreeable to many palates.
    To the Italian shepherd, bread and olives, with a little wine,
    form a nourishing diet; but in England, olives are usually only
    introduced by way of dessert, to destroy the taste of the viands
    which have been previously eaten, that the flavour of the wine
    may be the better enjoyed. There are three kinds of olives
    imported to London,--the French, Spanish, and Italian: the first
    are from Provence, and are generally accounted excellent; the
    second are larger, but more bitter; and the last are from Lucca,
    and are esteemed the best. The oil extracted from olives, called
    olive oil, or salad oil, is, with the continentals, in continual
    request, more dishes being prepared with than without it, we
    should imagine. With us, it is principally used in mixing a
    salad, and when thus employed, it tends to prevent fermentation,
    and is an antidote against flatulency.

II.

507. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1/4 teaspoonful of white pepper,
half that quantity of cayenne, salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, vinegar.

Mode.--Boil the eggs until hard, which will be in about 1/4 hour or 20 minutes; put them into
cold water, take off the shells, and pound the yolks in a mortar to a smooth paste. Then add
all the other ingredients, except the vinegar, and stir them well until the whole are thoroughly
incorporated one with the other. Pour in sufficient vinegar to make it of the consistency of
cream, taking care to add but little at a time. The mixture will then be ready for use.

Average cost, for this quantity, 7d.

Sufficient for a moderate-sized salad.

Note.--The whites of the eggs, cut into rings, will serve very well as a garnishing to the salad.

III.

508. INGREDIENTS.--1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of salad oil, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1/4 teaspoonful
of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream.

Mode.--Prepare and mix the ingredients by the preceding recipe, and be very particular that
the whole is well stirred.

Note.--In making salads, the vegetables, &c., should never be added to the sauce very long
before they are wanted for table; the dressing, however, may always be prepared some hours
before required. Where salads are much in request, it is a good plan to bottle off sufficient
dressing for a few days' consumption, as, thereby, much time and trouble are saved. If kept
in a cool place, it will remain good for 4 or 5 days.

    POETIC RECIPE FOR SALAD.--The Rev. Sydney Smith, the witty canon
    of St. Paul's, who thought that an enjoyment of the good things
    of this earth was compatible with aspirations for things higher,
    wrote the following excellent recipe for salad, which we should
    advise our readers not to pass by without a trial, when the hot
    weather invites to a dish of cold lamb. May they find the
    flavour equal to the rhyme.--

      "Two large potatoes, pass'd through kitchen sieve,
      Smoothness and softness to the salad give:
      Of mordent mustard add a single spoon,
      Distrust the condiment that bites too soon;
      But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault.
      To add a double quantity of salt:
      Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown,
      And twice with vinegar procured from 'town;
      True flavour needs it, and your poet begs,
      The pounded yellow of two well-boil'd eggs.
      Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl,
      And, scarce suspected, animate the whole;
      And, lastly, in the flavour'd compound toss
      A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce.
      Oh! great and glorious, and herbaceous treat,
      'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat.
      Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul,
      And plunge his fingers in the salad-bowl."

SAUCE ALLEMANDE, or GERMAN SAUCE.

509. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of sauce tournée (No. 517), the yolks of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Put the sauce into a stewpan, heat it, and stir to it the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, which
have been previously strained. Let it just simmer, but not boil, or the eggs will curdle; and
after they are added to the sauce, it must be stirred without ceasing. This sauce is a general
favourite, and is used for many made dishes.

Time.--1 minute to simmer.

Average cost, 6d.

SAUCE ARISTOCRATIQUE (a Store Sauce).

510. INGREDIENTS.--Green walnuts. To every pint of juice, 1 lb. of anchovies, 1 drachm of cloves,
1 drachm of mace, 1 drachm of Jamaica ginger bruised, 8 shalots. To every pint of the boiled
liquor, 1/2 pint of vinegar, 1/4 pint of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of soy.

Mode.--Pound the walnuts in a mortar, squeeze out the juice through a strainer, and let it
stand to settle. Pour off the clear juice, and to every pint of it, add anchovies, spices,
and cloves in the above proportion. Boil all these together till the anchovies are dissolved,
then strain the juice again, put in the shalots (8 to every pint), and boil again. To every
pint of the boiled liquor add vinegar, wine, and soy, in the above quantities, and bottle off
for use. Cork well, and seal the corks.

Seasonable.--Make this sauce from the beginning to the middle of July, when walnuts are in
perfection for sauces and pickling.

Average cost, 3s. 6d. for a quart.

    MANUFACTURE OF SAUCES.--In France, during the reign of Louis
    XII., at the latter end of the 14th century, there was formed a
    company of sauce-manufacturers, who obtained, in those days of
    monopolies, the exclusive privilege of making sauces. The
    statutes drawn up by this company inform us that the famous
    sauce à la cameline, sold by them, was to be composed or "good
    cinnamon, good ginger, good cloves, good grains of paradise,
    good bread, and good vinegar." The sauce Tence, was to be made
    of "good sound almonds, good ginger, good wine, and good
    verjuice." May we respectfully express a hope--not that we
    desire to doubt it in the least--that the English
    sauce-manufacturers of the 19th century are equally considerate
    and careful in choosing their ingredients for their various
    well-known preparations.

SAUCE A L'AURORE, for Trout, Soles, &c.

511.

Mode.--Take the spawn and pound it in a mortar with the butter, until quite smooth, and work
it through a hair sieve. Put the Béchamel into a stewpan, add the pounded spawn, the lemon-juice,
which must be strained, and a plentiful seasoning of cayenne and salt; let it just simmer,
but do not allow it to boil, or the beautiful red colour of the sauce will be spoiled. A small
spoonful of anchovy essence may be added at pleasure.

Time.--1 minute to simmer. Average cost, for this quantity, 1s.

Sufficient for a pair of large soles.

Seasonable at any time.

SAUCE A LA MATELOTE, for Fish.

512. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of Espagnole (No. 411), 3 onions, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom
ketchup, 1/2 glass of port wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, 1/2 bay-leaf, salt and pepper to taste,
1 clove, 2 berries of allspice, a little liquor in which the fish has been boiled, lemon-juice,
and anchovy sauce.

Mode.--Slice and fry the onions of a nice brown colour, and put them into a stewpan with the
Espagnole, ketchup, wine, and a little liquor in which the fish has been boiled. Add the seasoning,
herbs, and spices, and simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring well the whole time; strain it
through a fine hair sieve, put in the lemon-juice and anchovy sauce, and pour it over the fish.
This sauce may be very much enriched by adding a few small quenelles, or forcemeat balls made
of fish, and also glazed onions or mushrooms. These, however, should not be added to the matelote
till it is dished.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--This sauce originally took its name as being similar to that which the French sailor
(matelot) employed as a relish to the fish he caught and ate. In some cases, cider and perry
were substituted for the wine. The Norman matelotes were very celebrated.

    THE BAY.--We have already described (see No. 180) the difference
    between the cherry-laurel (Prunus Laurus cerasus) and the
    classic laurel (Laurus nobilis), the former only being used
    for culinary purposes. The latter beautiful evergreen was
    consecrated by the ancients to priests and heroes, and used in
    their sacrifices. "A crown of bay" was the earnestly-desired
    reward for great enterprises, and for the display of uncommon
    genius in oratory or writing. It was more particularly sacred to
    Apollo, because, according to the fable, the nymph Daphne was
    changed into a laurel-tree. The ancients believed, too, that the
    laurel had the power of communicating the gift of prophecy, as
    well as poetic genius; and, when they wished to procure pleasant
    dreams, would place a sprig under the pillow of their bed. It
    was the symbol, too, of victory, and it was thought that the
    laurel could never be struck by lightning. From this word comes
    that of "laureate;" Alfred Tennyson being the present poet
    laureate, crowned with laurel as the first of living bards.

SAUCE PIQUANTE, for Cutlets, Roast Meat, &c.

513. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 1 small carrot, 6 shalots, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs,
including parsley, 1/2 a bay-leaf, 2 slices of lean ham, 2 cloves, 6 peppercorns, 1 blade of
mace, 3 whole allspice, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1/2 pint of stock (No. 104 or 105), 1
small lump of sugar, 1/4 saltspoonful of cayenne, salt to taste.

Mode.--Put into a stewpan the butter, with the carrot and shalots, both of which must be cut
into small slices; add the herbs, bay-leaf, spices, and ham (which must be minced rather finely),
and let these ingredients simmer over a slow fire, until the bottom of the stewpan is covered
with a brown glaze. Keep stirring with a wooden spoon, and put in the remaining ingredients.
Simmer very gently for 1/4 hour, skim off every particle of fat, strain the sauce through a
sieve, and serve very hot. Care must be taken that this sauce be not made too acid, although
it should possess a sharpness indicated by its name. Of course the above quantity of vinegar
may be increased or diminished at pleasure, according to taste.

Time.--Altogether 1/2 hour. Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient for a medium-sized dish of cutlets.

Seasonable at any time.

A GOOD SAUCE FOR VARIOUS BOILED PUDDINGS.

514. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1/4 lb. of pounded sugar, a wineglassful of brandy or rum.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream, until no lumps remain; add the pounded sugar, and brandy
or rum; stir once or twice until the whole is thoroughly mixed, and serve. This sauce may either
be poured round the pudding or served in a tureen, according to the taste or fancy of the cook
or mistress.

Average cost, 8d. for this quantity.

Sufficient for a pudding.

SAUCE ROBERT, for Steaks, &c.

515. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 3 onions, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy,
or stock No. 105, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of made mustard, 1 teaspoonful of
vinegar, the juice of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Put the butter into a stewpan, set it on the fire, and, when browning, throw in the
onions, which must be cut into small slices. Fry them brown, but do not burn them; add the
flour, shake the onions in it, and give the whole another fry. Put in the gravy and seasoning,
and boil it gently for 10 minutes; skim off the fat, add the mustard, vinegar, and lemon-juice;
give it one boil, and pour round the steaks, or whatever dish the sauce has been prepared for.

Time.---Altogether 1/2 hour. Average cost, for this quantity, 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

Sufficient for about 2 lbs. of steak.

Note.--This sauce will be found an excellent accompaniment to roast goose, pork, mutton cutlets,
and various other dishes.

A GOOD SAUCE FOR STEAKS.

516. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of whole black pepper, 1/2 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of salt, 1/2 oz.
grated horseradish, 1/2 oz. of pickled shalots, 1 pint of mushroom ketchup or walnut pickle.

Mode.--Pound all the ingredients finely in a mortar, and put them into the ketchup or walnut-liquor.
Let them stand for a fortnight, when strain off the liquor and bottle for use. Either pour
a little of the sauce over the steaks or mix it in the gravy.

Seasonable.--This can be made at any time.

Note.--In using a jar of pickled walnuts, there is frequently left a large quantity of liquor;
this should be converted into a sauce like the above, and will be found a very useful relish.

    THE GROWTH OF THE PEPPER-PLANT.--Our readers will see at Nos.
    369 and 399, a description, with engravings, of the qualities of
    black and long pepper, and an account of where these spices are
    found. We will here say something of the manner of the growth of
    the pepper-plant. Like the vine, it requires support, and it is
    usual to plant a thorny tree by its side, to which it may cling.
    In Malabar, the chief pepper district of India, the jacca-tree
    (Artocarpus integrifolia) is made thus to yield its
    assistance, the same soil being adapted to the growth of both
    plants. The stem of the pepper-plant entwines round its support
    to a considerable height; the flexile branches then droop
    downwards, bearing at their extremities, as well as at other
    parts, spikes of green flowers, which are followed by the
    pungent berries. These hang in large bunches, resembling in
    shape those of grapes; but the fruit grows distinct, each on a
    little stalk, like currants. Each berry contains a single seed,
    of a globular form and brownish colour, but which changes to a
    nearly black when dried; and this is the pepper of commerce. The
    leaves are not unlike those of the ivy, but are larger and of
    rather lighter colour; they partake strongly of the peculiar
    smell and pungent taste of the berry.

SAUCE TOURNEE.

517. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of white stock (No. 107), thickening of flour and butter, or white
roux (No. 526), a faggot of savoury herbs, including parsley, 6 chopped mushrooms, 6 green onions.

Mode.--Put the stock into a stewpan with the herbs, onions, and mushrooms, and let it simmer
very gently for about 1/2 hour; stir in sufficient thickening to make it of a proper consistency;
let it boil for a few minutes, then skim off all the fat, strain and serve. This sauce, with
the addition of a little cream, is now frequently called velouté.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, for this quantity, 6d.

Note.--If poultry trimmings are at hand, the stock should be made of these; and the above sauce
should not be made too thick, as it does not then admit of the fat being nicely removed.

SWEET SAUCE, for Venison.

518. INGREDIENTS.--A small jar of red-currant jelly, 1 glass of port wine.

Mode.--Put the above ingredients into a stewpan, set them over the fire, and, when melted,
pour in a tureen and serve. It should not be allowed to boil.

Time.--5 minutes to melt the jelly.

Average cost, for this quantity, 1s.

SAUCE FOR WILDFOWL.

519. INGREDIENTS.--1 glass of port wine, 1 tablespoonful of Leamington sauce (No. 459), 1 tablespoonful
of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 slice of lemon-peel, 1 large shalot
cut in slices, 1 blade of mace, cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, set it over the fire, and let it simmer for
about 5 minutes; then strain and serve the sauce in a tureen.

Time.--5 minutes. Average cost, for this quantity, 8d.

SAUSAGE-MEAT STUFFING, for Turkey.

520. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of lean pork, 6 oz. of fat pork, both weighed after being chopped
(beef suet may be substituted for the latter), 2 oz. of bread crumbs, 1 small tablespoonful
of minced sage, 1 blade of pounded mace, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.

Mode.--Chop the meat and fat very finely, mix with them the other ingredients, taking care
that the whole is thoroughly incorporated. Moisten with the egg, and the stuffing will be ready
for use. Equal quantities of this stuffing and forcemeat, No. 417, will be found to answer
very well, as the herbs, lemon-peel, &c. in the latter, impart a very delicious flavour to
the sausage-meat. As preparations, however, like stuffings and forcemeats, are matters to be
decided by individual tastes, they must be left, to a great extent, to the discrimination of
the cook, who should study her employer's taste in this, as in every other respect.

Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for a small turkey.

SAVOURY JELLY FOR MEAT PIES.

521. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of shin of beef, 1 calf's-foot, 3 lbs. of knuckle of veal, poultry
trimmings (if for game pies, any game trimmings), 2 onions stuck with cloves, 2 carrots, 4
shalots, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 bay-leaves; when liked, 2 blades of mace and a little
spice; 2 slices of lean ham, rather more than 2 quarts of water.

Mode.--Cut up the meat and put it into a stewpan with all the ingredients except the water;
set it over a slow fire to draw down, and, when the gravy ceases to flow from the meat, pour
in the water. Let it boil up, then carefully take away all scum from the top. Cover the stewpan
closely, and let the stock simmer very gently for 4 hours: if rapidly boiled, the jelly will
not be clear. When done, strain it through a fine sieve or flannel bag; and when cold, the
jelly should be quite transparent. If this is not the case, clarify it with the whites of eggs,
as described in recipe No. 109.

Time.--4 hours. Average cost, for this quantity, 5s.

SHRIMP SAUCE, for Various Kinds of Fish.

522. INGREDIENTS.--1/3 pint of melted butter (No. 376), 1/4 pint of picked shrimps, cayenne
to taste.

Mode.--Make the melted butter very smoothly by recipe No. 376, shell the shrimps (sufficient
to make 1/4 pint when picked), and put them into the butter; season with cayenne, and let the
sauce just simmer, but do not allow it to boil. When liked, a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce
may be added.

SPINACH GREEN FOR COLOURING VARIOUS DISHES.

523. INGREDIENTS.--2 handfuls of spinach.

Mode.--Pick and wash the spinach free from dirt, and pound the leaves in a mortar to extract
the juice; then press it through a hair sieve, and put the juice into a small stewpan or jar.
Place this in a bain marie, or saucepan of boiling water, and let it set. Watch it closely,
as it should not boil; and, as soon as it is done, lay it in a sieve, so that all the water
may drain from it, and the green will then be ready for colouring. If made according to this
recipe, the spinach-green will be found far superior to that boiled in the ordinary way.

HOT SPICE, a Delicious Adjunct to Chops, Steaks, Gravies, &c.

524. INGREDIENTS.--3 drachms each of ginger, black pepper, and cinnamon, 7 cloves, 1/2 oz.
mace, 1/4 oz. of cayenne, 1 oz. grated nutmeg, 1-1/2 oz. white pepper.

Mode.--Pound the ingredients, and mix them thoroughly together, taking care that everything
is well blended. Put the spice in a very dry glass bottle for use. The quantity of cayenne
may be increased, should the above not be enough to suit the palate.

    CINNAMON.--The cinnamon-tree (Laurus Cinnamomum) is a valuable
    and beautiful species of the laurel family, and grows to the
    height of 20 or 30 feet. The trunk is short and straight, with
    wide-spreading branches, and it has a smooth ash-like bark. The
    leaves are upon short stalks, and are of an oval shape, and 3 to
    5 inches long. The flowers are in panicles, with six small
    petals, and the fruit is about the size of an olive, soft,
    insipid, and of a deep blue. This incloses a nut, the kernel of
    which germinates soon after it falls. The wood of the tree is
    white and not very solid, and its root is thick and branching,
    exuding a great quantity of camphor. The inner bark of the tree
    forms the cinnamon of commerce. Ceylon was thought to be its
    native island; but it has been found in Malabar, Cochin-China,
    Sumatra, and the Eastern Islands; also in the Brazils, the
    Mauritius, Jamaica, and other tropical localities.

BROWN ROUX, a French Thickening for Gravies and Sauces.

525. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of butter, 9 oz. of flour.

Mode.--Melt the butter in a stewpan over a slow fire, and dredge in, very gradually, the flour;
stir it till of a light-brown colour--to obtain this do it very slowly, otherwise the flour
will burn and impart a bitter taste to the sauce it is mixed with. Pour it in a jar, and keep
it for use: it will remain good some time.

Time.--About 1/2 hour. Average cost, 7d.

WHITE ROUX, for thickening White Sauces.

526. Allow the same proportions of butter and flour as in the preceding recipe, and proceed
in the same manner as for brown roux, but do not keep it on the fire too long, and take care
not to let it colour. This is used for thickening white sauce. Pour it into a jar to use when
wanted.

Time.--1/4 hour. Average cost, 7d.

Sufficient,--A dessertspoonful will thicken a pint of gravy.

Note.--Besides the above, sauces may be thickened with potato flour, ground rice, baked flour,
arrowroot, &c.: the latter will be found far preferable to the ordinary flour for white sauces.
A slice of bread, toasted and added to gravies, answers the two purposes of thickening and
colouring them.

SPANISH ONIONS--PICKLED.

527. INGREDIENTS.--Onions, vinegar; salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Cut the onions in thin slices; put a layer of them in the bottom of a jar; sprinkle
with salt and cayenne; then add another layer of onions, and season as before. Proceeding in
this manner till the jar is full, pour in sufficient vinegar to cover the whole, and the pickle
will be fit for use in a month.

Seasonable.--May be had in England from September to February.

STORE SAUCE, or CHEROKEE.

528. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz. of cayenne pepper, 5 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoonfuls of soy,
1 tablespoonful of walnut ketchup, 1 pint of vinegar.

Mode.--Boil all the ingredients gently for about 1/2 hour; strain the liquor, and bottle off
for use.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Seasonable.--This sauce can be made at any time.

TOMATO SAUCE--HOT, to serve with Cutlets, Roast Meats, &c.

529. INGREDIENTS.--6 tomatoes, 2 shalots, 1 clove, 1 blade of mace, salt and cayenne to taste,
1/4 pint of gravy, No. 436, or stock No. 104.

Mode.--Cut the tomatoes in two, and squeeze the juice and seeds out; put them in a stewpan
with all the ingredients, and let them simmer gently until the tomatoes are tender enough to
pulp; rub the whole through a sieve, boil it for a few minutes, and serve. The shalots and
spices may be omitted when their flavour is objected to.

Time.--1 hour, or rather more, to simmer the tomatoes.

Average cost, for this quantity, 1s.

In full season in September and October.

    TOMATO, OR LOVE-APPLE.--The plant which bears this fruit is a
    native of South America, and takes its name from a Portuguese
    word. The tomato fruit is about the size of a small potato, and
    is chiefly used in soups, sauces, and gravies. It is sometimes
    served to table roasted or boiled, and when green, makes a good
    ketchup or pickle. In its unripe state, it is esteemed as
    excellent sauce for roast goose or pork, and when quite ripe, a
    good store sauce may be prepared from it.

TOMATO SAUCE FOR KEEPING (Excellent).

I.

530. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of tomato-pulp allow 1 pint of cayenne vinegar (No. 386),
3/4 oz. of shalots, 3/4 oz. of garlic, peeled and cut in slices; salt to taste. To every six
quarts of liquor, 1 pint of soy, 1 pint of anchovy sauce.

Mode.--Gather the tomatoes quite ripe; bake them in a slow oven till tender; rub them through
a sieve, and to every quart of pulp add cayenne vinegar, shalots, garlic, and salt, in the
above proportion; boil the whole together till the garlic and shalots are quite soft; then
rub it through a sieve, put it again into a saucepan, and, to every six quarts of the liquor,
add 1 pint of soy and the same quantity of anchovy sauce, and boil altogether for about 20
minutes; bottle off for use, and carefully seal or rosin the corks. This will keep good for
2 or 3 years, but will be fit for use in a week. A useful and less expensive sauce may be made
by omitting the anchovy and soy.

Time.--Altogether 1 hour.

Seasonable.--Make this from the middle of September to the end of October.

II.

531. INGREDIENTS.--1 dozen tomatoes, 2 teaspoonfuls of the best powdered ginger, 1 dessertspoonful
of salt, 1 head of garlic chopped fine, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful of Chili
vinegar (a small quantity of cayenne may be substituted for this).

Mode.--Choose ripe tomatoes, put them into a stone jar, and stand them in a cool oven until
quite tender; when cold, take the skins and stalks from them, mix the pulp with the liquor
which is in the jar, but do not strain it; add all the other ingredients, mix well together,
and put it into well-sealed bottles. Stored away in a cool dry place, it will keep good for
years. It is ready for use as soon as made, but the flavour is better after a week or two.
Should it not appear to keep, turn it out, and boil it up with a little additional ginger and
cayenne. For immediate use, the skins should be put into a wide-mouthed bottle with a little
of the different ingredients, and they will be found very nice for hashes or stews.

Time.--4 or 5 hours in a cool oven.

Seasonable from the middle of September to the end of October.

III.

532. INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen tomatoes; to every pound of tomato-pulp allow 1 pint of Chili vinegar,
1 oz. of garlic, 1 oz. of shalot, 2 oz. of salt, 1 large green capsicum, 1/2 teaspoonful of
cayenne, 2 pickled gherkins, 6 pickled onions, 1 pint of common vinegar, and the juice of 6 lemons.

Mode.--Choose the tomatoes when quite ripe and red; put them in a jar with a cover to it, and
bake them till tender. The better way is to put them in the oven overnight, when it will not
be too hot, and examine them in the morning to see if they are tender. Do not allow them to
remain in the oven long enough to break them; but they should be sufficiently soft to skin
nicely and rub through the sieve. Measure the pulp, and to each pound of pulp, add the above
proportion of vinegar and other ingredients, taking care to chop very fine the garlic, shalot,
capsicum, onion, and gherkins. Boil the whole together till everything is tender; then again
rub it through a sieve, and add the lemon-juice. Now boil the whole again till it becomes as
thick as cream, and keep continually stirring; bottle it when quite cold, cork well, and seal
the corks. If the flavour of garlic and shalot is very much disliked, diminish the quantities.

Time.--Bake the tomatoes in a cool oven all night.

Seasonable from the middle of September to the end of October.

Note.--A quantity of liquor will flow from the tomatoes, which must be put through the sieve
with the rest. Keep it well stirred while on the fire, and use a wooden spoon.

UNIVERSAL PICKLE.

533.

Mode.--Boil all the ingredients together for about 20 minutes; when cold, put them into a jar
with whatever vegetables you choose, such as radish-pods, French beans, cauliflowers, gherkins,
&c. &c., as these come into season; put them in fresh as you gather them, having previously
wiped them perfectly free from moisture and grit. This pickle will be fit for use in about
8 or 9 months.

Time.--20 minutes.

Seasonable.--Make the pickle in May or June, to be ready for the various vegetables.

Note.--As this pickle takes 2 or 3 months to make,--that is to say, nearly that time will elapse
before all the different vegetables are added,--care must be taken to keep the jar which contains
the pickle well covered, either with a closely-fitting lid, or a piece of bladder securely
tied over, so as perfectly to exclude the air.

PICKLED WALNUTS (Very Good).

534. INGREDIENTS.--100 walnuts, salt and water. To each quart of vinegar allow 2 oz. of whole
black pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of bruised ginger.

Mode.--Procure the walnuts while young; be careful they are not woody, and prick them well
with a fork; prepare a strong brine of salt and water (4 lbs. of salt to each gallon of water),
into which put the walnuts, letting them remain 9 days, and changing the brine every third
day; drain them off, put them on a dish, place it in the sun until they become perfectly black,
which will be in 2 or 3 days; have ready dry jars, into which place the walnuts, and do not
quite fill the jars. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, for 10 minutes, with spices in
the above proportion, and pour it hot over the walnuts, which must be quite covered with the
pickle; tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place. They will be fit for use in a month,
and will keep good 2 or 3 years.

Time.--10 minutes.

Seasonable.--Make this from the beginning to the middle of July, before the walnuts harden.

Note.--When liked, a few shalots may be added to the vinegar, and boiled with it.

WALNUT KETCHUP.

I.

535. INGREDIENTS.--100 walnuts, 1 handful of salt, 1 quart of vinegar, 1/4 oz. of mace, 1/4
oz. of nutmeg, 1/4 oz. of cloves, 1/4 oz. of ginger, 1/4 oz. of whole black pepper, a small
piece of horseradish, 20 shalots, 1/4 lb. of anchovies, 1 pint of port wine.

Mode.--Procure the walnuts at the time you can run a pin through them, slightly bruise, and
put them into a jar with the salt and vinegar, let them stand 8 days, stirring every day; then
drain the liquor from them, and boil it, with the above ingredients, for about 1/2 hour. It
may be strained or not, as preferred, and, if required, a little more vinegar or wine can be
added, according to taste. When bottled well, seal the corks.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Seasonable.--Make this from the beginning to the middle of July, when walnuts are in perfection
for pickling purposes.

II.

536. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 sieve of walnut-shells, 2 quarts of water, salt, 1/2 lb. of shalots,
1 oz. of cloves, 1 oz. of mace, 1 oz. of whole pepper, 1 oz. of garlic.

Mode.--Put the walnut-shells into a pan, with the water, and a large quantity of salt; let
them stand for 10 days, then break the shells up in the water, and let it drain through a sieve,
putting a heavy weight on the top to express the juice; place it on the fire, and remove all
scum that may arise. Now boil the liquor with the shalots, cloves, mace, pepper, and garlic,
and let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan, and, when cold, bottle,
and cork closely. It should stand 6 months before using: should it ferment during that time,
it must be again boiled and skimmed.

Time.--About 3/4 hour.

Seasonable in September, when the walnut-shells are obtainable.

    THE WALNUT.--This nut is a native of Persia, and was introduced
    into England from France. As a pickle, it is much used in the
    green state; and grated walnuts in Spain are much employed, both
    in tarts and other dishes. On the continent it is occasionally
    employed as a substitute for olive oil in cooking; but it is
    apt, under such circumstances, to become rancid. The matter
    which remains after the oil is extracted is considered highly
    nutritious for poultry. It is called mare, and in Switzerland
    is eaten under the name of pain amer by the poor. The oil is
    frequently manufactured into a kind of soap, and the leaves and
    green husks yield an extract, which, as a brown dye, is used to
    stain hair, wool, and wood.

WHITE SAUCE (Good).

537.

Mode.--Have ready a delicately-clean saucepan, into which put the stock, which should be well
flavoured with vegetables, and rather savoury; mix the flour smoothly with the cream, add it
to the stock, season with a little salt, and boil all these ingredients very gently for about
10 minutes, keeping them well stirred the whole time, as this sauce is very liable to burn.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for a pair of fowls.

Seasonable at any time.

WHITE SAUCE, made without Meat.

538. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 2 small onions, 1 carrot, 1/2 a small teacupful of flour,
1 pint of new milk, salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Cut up the onions and carrot very small, and put them into a stewpan with the butter;
simmer them till the butter is nearly dried up; then stir in the flour, and add the milk; boil
the whole gently until it thickens, strain it, season with salt and cayenne, and it will be
ready to serve.

Time.--1/4 hour. Average cost, 5d.

Sufficient for a pair of fowls.

Seasonable at any time.

WHITE SAUCE (a very Simple and Inexpensive Method).

539. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 1-1/2 oz. of rice, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 1 small blade
of pounded mace, salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Boil the milk with the lemon-peel and rice until the latter is perfectly tender, then
take out the lemon-peel and pound the milk and rice together; put it back into the stewpan
to warm, add the mace and seasoning, give it one boil, and serve. This sauce should be of the
consistency of thick cream.

Time.--About 1-1/2 hour to boil the rice.

Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient for a pair of fowls.

Seasonable at any time.

VARIOUS MODES OF COOKING MEAT.

CHAPTER XI.

GENERAL REMARKS.

540. In Our "INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY" (see No. 76) we have described the gradual progress of
mankind in the art of cookery, the probability being, that the human race, for a long period,
lived wholly on fruits. Man's means of attacking animals, even if he had the desire of slaughtering
them, were very limited, until he acquired the use of arms. He, however, made weapons for himself,
and, impelled by a carnivorous instinct, made prey of the animals that surrounded him. It is
natural that man should seek to feed on flesh; he has too small a stomach to be supported alone
by fruit, which has not sufficient nourishment to renovate him. It is possible he might subsist
on vegetables; but their preparation needs the knowledge of art, only to be obtained after
the lapse of many centuries. Man's first weapons were the branches of trees, which were succeeded
by bows and arrows, and it is worthy of remark, that these latter weapons have been found with
the natives of all climates and latitudes. It is singular how this idea presented itself to
individuals so differently placed.

541. BRILLAT SAVARIN says, that raw flesh has but one inconvenience,--from its viscousness
it attaches itself to the teeth. He goes on to say, that it is not, however, disagreeable;
but, when seasoned with salt, that it is easily digested. He tells a story of a Croat captain,
whom he invited to dinner in 1815, during the occupation of Paris by the allied troops. This
officer was amazed at his host's preparations, and said, "When we are campaigning, and get
hungry, we knock over the first animal we find, cut off a steak, powder it with salt, which
we always have in the sabretasche, put it under the saddle, gallop over it for half a mile,
and then dine like princes." Again, of the huntsmen of Dauphiny it is said, that when they
are out shooting in September, they take with them both pepper and salt. If they kill a very
fat bird, they pluck and season it, and, after carrying it some time in their caps, eat it.
This, they declare, is the best way of serving it up.

542. SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE CROAT MODE, which, doubtless, was in fashion in the earlier ages of
the world, fire was discovered. This was an accident; for fire is not, although we are accustomed
to call it so, an element, or spontaneous. Many savage nations have been found utterly ignorant
of it, and many races had no other way of dressing their food than by exposing it to the rays
of the sun.

543. THE INHABITANTS OF THE MARIAN ISLANDS, which were discovered in 1521, had no idea of fire.
Never was astonishment greater than theirs when they first saw it, on the descent of Magellan,
the navigator, on one of their isles. At first they thought it a kind of animal, that fixed
itself to and fed upon wood. Some of them, who approached too near, being burnt, the rest were
terrified, and durst only look upon it at a distance. They were afraid, they said, of being
bit, or lest that dreadful animal should wound with his violent respiration and dreadful breath;
for these were the first notions they formed of the heat and flame. Such, too, probably, were
the notions the Greeks originally formed of them.

544. FIRE HAVING BEEN DISCOVERED, mankind endeavoured to make use of it for drying, and afterwards
for cooking their meat; but they were a considerable time before they hit upon proper and commodious
methods of employing it in the preparation of their food.

545. MEAT, THEN, PLACED ON BURNING FUEL was found better than when raw: it had more firmness,
was eaten with less difficulty, and the ozmazome being condensed by the carbonization, gave
it a pleasing perfume and flavour. Still, however, the meat cooked on the coal would become
somewhat befouled, certain portions of the fuel adhering to it. This disadvantage was remedied
by passing spits through it, and placing it at a suitable height above the burning fuel. Thus
grilling was invented; and it is well known that, simple as is this mode of cookery, yet all
meat cooked in this way is richly and pleasantly flavoured. In Homer's time, the, art of cookery
had not advanced much beyond this; for we read in the "Iliad," how the great Achilles and his
friend Patroclus regaled the three Grecian leaders on bread, wine, and broiled meat. It is
noticeable, too, that Homer does not speak of boiled meat anywhere in his poems. Later, however,
the Jews, coming out of their captivity in Egypt, had made much greater progress. They undoubtedly
possessed kettles; and in one of these, Esau's mess of pottage, for which he sold his birthright,
must have been prepared.

546. HAVING THUS BRIEFLY TRACED A HISTORY OF GASTRONOMICAL PROGRESSES, we will now proceed
to describe the various methods of cooking meat, and make a few observations on the chemical
changes which occur in each of the operations.

547. IN THIS COUNTRY, plain boiling, roasting, and baking are the usual methods of cooking
animal food. To explain the philosophy of these simple culinary operations, we must advert
to the effects that are produced by heat on the principal constituents of flesh. When finely-chopped
mutton or beef is steeped for some time in a small quantity of clean water, and then subjected
to slight pressure, the juice of the meat is extracted, and there is left a white tasteless
residue, consisting chiefly of muscular fibres. When this residue is heated to between 158°
and 177° Fahrenheit, the fibres shrink together, and become hard and horny. The influence of
an elevated temperature on the soluble extract of flesh is not less remarkable. When the watery
infusion, which contains all the savoury constituents of the meat, is gradually heated, it
soon becomes turbid; and, when the temperature reaches 133°, flakes of whitish matter separate.
These flakes are albumen, a substance precisely similar, in all its properties, to the white
of egg (see No. 101). When the temperature of the watery extract is raised to 158°, the colouring
matter of the blood coagulates, and the liquid, which was originally tinged red by this substance,
is left perfectly clear, and almost colourless. When evaporated, even at a gentle heat, this
residual liquid gradually becomes brown, and acquires the flavour of roast meat.

548. THESE INTERESTING FACTS, discovered in the laboratory, throw a flood of light upon the
mysteries of the kitchen. The fibres of meat are surrounded by a liquid which contains albumen
in its soluble state, just as it exists in the unboiled egg. During the operation of boiling
or roasting, this substance coagulates, and thereby prevents the contraction and hardening
of the fibres. The tenderness of well-cooked meat is consequently proportioned to the amount
of albumen deposited in its substance. Meat is underdone when it has been heated throughout
only to the temperature of coagulating albumen: it is thoroughly done when it has been heated
through its whole mass to the temperature at which the colouring matter of the blood coagulates:
it is overdone when the heat has been continued long enough to harden the fibres.

549. THE JUICE OF FLESH IS WATER, holding in solution many substances besides albumen, which
are of the highest possible value as articles of food. In preparing meat for the table, great
care should be taken to prevent the escape of this precious juice, as the succulence and sapidity
of the meat depend on its retention. The meat to be cooked should be exposed at first to a
quick heat, which immediately coagulates the albumen on and near the surface. A kind of shell
is thus formed, which effectually retains the whole of the juice within the meat.

550. DURING THE OPERATIONS OF BOILING, BOASTING, AND BAKING, fresh beef and mutton, when moderately
fat, lose, according to Johnston, on an average about--

                      In boiling.  In baking.    In roasting.

  4 lbs. of beef lose    1 lb.     1 lb. 3 oz.   1 lb. 5 oz.

  4 lbs. of mutton lose  14 oz.    1 lb. 4 oz.   1 lb. 6 oz.

BAKING.

551. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROASTING MEAT AND BAKING IT, may be generally described as consisting
in the fact, that, in baking it, the fumes caused by the operation are not carried off in the
same way as occurs in roasting. Much, however, of this disadvantage is obviated by the improved
construction of modern ovens, and of especially those in connection with the Leamington kitchener,
of which we give an engraving here, and a full description of which will be seen at paragraph
No. 65, with the prices at which they can be purchased of Messrs. R. and J. Slack, of the Strand.
With meat baked in the generality of ovens, however, which do not possess ventilators on the
principle of this kitchener, there is undoubtedly a peculiar taste, which does not at all equal
the flavour developed by roasting meat. The chemistry of baking may be said to be the same
as that described in roasting.

552. SHOULD THE OVEN BE VERY BRISK, it will be found necessary to cover the joint with a piece
of white paper, to prevent the meat from being scorched and blackened outside, before the heat
can penetrate into the inside. This paper should be removed half an hour before the time of
serving dinner, so that the joint may take a good colour.

553. BY MEANS OF A JAR, many dishes, which will be enumerated under their special heads, may
be economically prepared in the oven. The principal of these are soup, gravies, jugged hare,
beef tea; and this mode of cooking may be advantageously adopted with a ham, which has previously
been covered with a common crust of flour and water.

554. ALL DISHES PREPARED FOR BAKING should be more highly seasoned than when intended to be
roasted. There are some dishes which, it may be said, are at least equally well cooked in the
oven as by the roaster; thus, a shoulder of mutton and baked potatoes, a fillet or breast of
veal, a sucking pig, a hare, well basted, will be received by connoisseurs as well, when baked,
as if they had been roasted. Indeed, the baker's oven, or the family oven, may often, as has
been said, be substituted for the cook and the spit with greater economy and convenience.

555. A BAKING-DISH, of which we give an engraving, should not be less than 6 or 7 inches deep;
so that the meat, which of course cannot be basted, can stew in its own juices. In the recipe
for each dish, full explanations concerning any special points in relation to it will be given.

BOILING.

556. BOILING, or the preparation of meat by hot water, though one of the easiest processes
in cookery, requires skilful management. Boiled meat should be tender, savoury, and full of
its own juice, or natural gravy; but, through the carelessness and ignorance of cooks, it is
too often sent to table hard, tasteless, and innutritious. To insure a successful result in
boiling flesh, the heat of the fire must be judiciously regulated, the proper quantity of water
must be kept up in the pot, and the scum which rises to the surface must be carefully removed.

557. MANY WRITERS ON COOKERY assert that the meat to be boiled should be put into cold water,
and that the pot should be heated gradually; but Liebig, the highest authority on all matters
connected with the chemistry of food, has shown that meat so treated loses some of its most
nutritious constituents. "If the flesh," says the great chemist, "be introduced into the boiler
when the water is in a state of brisk ebullition, and if the boiling be kept up for a few minutes,
and the pot then placed in a warm place, so that the temperature of the water is kept at 158°
to 165°, we have the united conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which best fit
it for being eaten." When a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water, the albumen which
is near the surface immediately coagulates, forming an envelope, which prevents the escape
of the internal juice, and most effectually excludes the water, which, by mixing with this
juice, would render the meat insipid. Meat treated thus is juicy and well-flavoured, when cooked,
as it retains most of its savoury constituents. On the other hand, if the piece of meat be
set on the fire with cold water, and this slowly heated to boiling, the flesh undergoes a loss
of soluble and nutritious substances, while, as a matter of course, the soup becomes richer
in these matters. The albumen is gradually dissolved from the surface to the centre; the fibre
loses, more or less, its quality of shortness or tenderness, and becomes hard and tough: the
thinner the piece of meat is, the greater is its loss of savoury constituents. In order to
obtain well-flavoured and eatable meat, we must relinquish the idea of making good soup from
it, as that mode of boiling which yields the best soup gives the driest, toughest, and most
vapid meat. Slow boiling whitens the meat; and, we suspect, that it is on this account that
it is in such favour with the cooks. The wholesomeness of food is, however, a matter of much
greater moment than the appearance it presents on the table. It should be borne in mind, that
the whiteness of meat that has been boiled slowly, is produced by the loss of some important
alimentary properties.

558. THE OBJECTIONS WE HAVE RAISED to the practice of putting meat on the fire in cold water,
apply with equal force to the practice of soaking meat before cooking it, which is so strongly
recommended by some cooks. Fresh meat ought never to be soaked, as all its most nutritive constituents
are soluble in water. Soaking, however, is an operation that cannot be entirely dispensed with
in the preparation of animal food. Salted and dried meats require to be soaked for some time
in water before they are cooked.

559. FOR BOILING MEAT, the softer the water is, the better. When spring water is boiled, the
chalk which gives to it the quality of hardness, is precipitated. This chalk stains the meat,
and communicates to it an unpleasant earthy taste. When nothing but hard water can be procured,
it should be softened by boiling it for an hour or two before it is used for culinary purposes.

560. THE FIRE MUST BE WATCHED with great attention during the operation of boiling, so that
its heat may be properly regulated. As a rule, the pot should be kept in a simmering state;
a result which cannot be attained without vigilance.

561. THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH WATER BOILS, under usual circumstances, is 212° Fahr. Water does
not become hotter after it has begun to boil, however long or with whatever violence the boiling
is continued. This fact is of great importance in cookery, and attention to it will save much
fuel. Water made to boil in a gentle way by the application of a moderate heat is just as hot
as when it is made to boil on a strong fire with the greatest possible violence. When once
water has been brought to the boiling point, the fire may be considerably reduced, as a very
gentle heat will suffice to keep the water at its highest temperature.

562. THE SCUM WHICH RISES to the surface of the pot during the operation of boiling must be
carefully removed, otherwise it will attach itself to the meat, and thereby spoil its appearance.
The cook must not neglect to skim during the whole process, though by far the greater part
of the scum rises at first. The practice of wrapping meat in a cloth may be dispensed with
if the skimming be skillfully managed. If the scum be removed as fast as it rises, the meat
will be cooked clean and pure, and come out of the vessel in which it was boiled, much more
delicate and firm than when cooked in a cloth.

563. WHEN TAKEN FROM THE POT, the meat must be wiped with a clean cloth, or, what will be found
more convenient, a sponge previously dipped in water and wrung dry. The meat should not be
allowed to stand a moment longer than necessary, as boiled meat, as well as roasted, cannot
be eaten too hot.

564. THE TIME ALLOWED FOR THE OPERATION OF BOILING must be regulated according to the size
and quality of the meat. As a general rule, twenty minutes, reckoning from the moment when
the boiling commences, may be allowed for every pound of meat. All the best authorities, however,
agree in this, that the longer the boiling the more perfect the operation.

565. A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF SALTED MEAT may be properly introduced in
this place. Every housewife knows that dry salt in contact with fresh meat gradually becomes
fluid brine. The application of salt causes the fibres of the meat to contract, and the juice
to flow out from its pores: as much as one-third of the juice of the meat is often forced out
in this manner. Now, as this juice is pure extract of meat, containing albumen, osmazome, and
other valuable principles, it follows that meat which has been preserved by the action of salt
can never have the nutritive properties of fresh meat.

566. THE VESSELS USED FOR BOILING should be made of cast-iron, well tinned within, and provided
with closely-fitting lids. They must be kept scrupulously clean, otherwise they will render
the meat cooked in them unsightly and unwholesome. Copper pans, if used at all, should be reserved
for operations that are performed with rapidity; as, by long contact with copper, food may
become dangerously contaminated. The kettle in which a joint is dressed should be large enough
to allow room for a good supply of water; if the meat be cramped and be surrounded with but
little water, it will be stewed, not boiled.

567. IN STEWING, IT IS NOT REQUISITE to have so great a heat as in boiling. A gentle simmering
in a small quantity of water, so that the meat is stewed almost in its own juices, is all that
is necessary. It is a method much used on the continent, and is wholesome and economical.

    Two useful culinary vessels are represented above. One is a
    boiling-pot, in which large joints may be boiled; the other is a
    stewpan, with a closely-fitting lid, to which is attached a long
    handle; so that the cover can be removed without scalding the
    fingers.

568. THE HOT-PLATE is a modern improvement on the old kitchen ranges, being used for boiling
and stewing. It is a plate of cast iron, having a closed fire burning beneath it, by which
it is thoroughly well heated. On this plate are set the various saucepans, stewpans, &c.; and,
by this convenient and economical method, a number of dishes may be prepared at one time. The
culinary processes of braising and stewing are, in this manner, rendered more gradual, and
consequently the substance acted on becomes more tender, and the gravy is not so much reduced.

BROILING.

569. GENERALLY SPEAKING, small dishes only are prepared by this mode of cooking; amongst these,
the beef-steak and mutton chop of the solitary English diner may be mentioned as celebrated
all the world over. Our beef-steak, indeed, has long crossed the Channel; and, with a view
of pleasing the Britons, there is in every carte at every French restaurant, by the side of
à la Marengo, and à la Mayonnaise,--bifteck d'Angleterre. In order to succeed in a broil, the
cook must have a bright, clear fire; so that the surface of the meat may be quickly heated.
The result of this is the same as that obtained in roasting; namely, that a crust, so to speak,
is formed outside, and thus the juices of the meat are retained. The appetite of an invalid,
so difficult to minister to, is often pleased with a broiled dish, as the flavour and sapidity
of the meat are so well preserved.

570. THE UTENSILS USED FOR BROILING need but little description. The common gridiron, for which
see engraving at No. 68, is the same as it has been for ages past, although some little variety
has been introduced into its manufacture, by the addition of grooves to the bars, by means
of which the liquid fat is carried into a small trough. One point it is well to bear in mind,
viz., that the gridiron should be kept in a direction slanting towards the cook, so that as
little fat as possible may fall into the fire. It has been observed, that broiling is the most
difficult manual office the general cook has to perform, and one that requires the most unremitting
attention; for she may turn her back upon the stewpan or the spit, but the gridiron can never
be left with impunity. The revolving gridiron, shown in the engraving, possesses some advantages
of convenience, which will be at once apparent.

FRYING.

571. THIS VERY FAVOURITE MODE OF COOKING may be accurately described as boiling in fat or oil.
Substances dressed in this way are generally well received, for they introduce an agreeable
variety, possessing, as they do, a peculiar flavour. By means of frying, cooks can soon satisfy
many requisitions made on them, it being a very expeditious mode of preparing dishes for the
table, and one which can be employed when the fire is not sufficiently large for the purposes
of roasting and boiling. The great point to be borne in mind in frying, is that the liquid
must be hot enough to act instantaneously, as all the merit of this culinary operation lies
in the invasion of the boiling liquid, which carbonizes or burns, at the very instant of the
immersion of the body placed in it. It may be ascertained if the fat is heated to the proper
degree, by cutting a piece of bread and dipping it in the frying-pan for five or six seconds;
and if it be firm and of a dark brown when taken out, put in immediately what you wish to prepare;
if it be not, let the fat be heated until of the right temperature. This having been effected,
moderate the fire, so that the action may not be too hurried, and that by a continuous heat
the juices of the substance may be preserved, and its flavour enhanced.

572. THE PHILOSOPHY OF FRYING consists in this, that liquids subjected to the action of fire
do not all receive the same quantity of heat. Being differently constituted in their nature,
they possess different "capacities for caloric." Thus, you may, with impunity, dip your finger
in boiling spirits of wine; you would take it very quickly from boiling brandy, yet more rapidly
from water; whilst the effects of the most rapid immersion in boiling oil need not be told.
As a consequence of this, heated fluids act differently on the sapid bodies presented to them.
Those put in water, dissolve, and are reduced to a soft mass; the result being bouillon, stock,
&c. (see No. 103). Those substances, on the contrary, treated with oil, harden, assume a more
or less deep colour, and are finally carbonized. The reason of these different results is,
that, in the first instance, water dissolves and extracts the interior juices of the alimentary
substances placed in it; whilst, in the second, the juices are preserved; for they are insoluble
in oil.

573. IT IS TO BE ESPECIALLY REMEMBERED, in connection with frying, that all dishes fried in
fat should be placed before the fire on a piece of blotting-paper, or sieve reversed, and there
left for a few minutes, so that any superfluous greasy moisture may be removed.

574. THE UTENSILS USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF FRYING are confined to frying-pans, although these
are of various sizes; and, for small and delicate dishes, such as collops, fritters, pancakes,
&c., the sauté pan, of which we give an engraving, is used.

COOKING BY GAS.

575. GAS-COOKING can scarcely now be considered a novelty,--many establishments, both small
and large, have been fitted with apparatus for cooking by this mode, which undoubtedly exhibits
some advantages. Thus the heat may be more regularly supplied to the substance cooking, and
the operation is essentially a clean one, because there can be no cinders or other dirt to
be provided for. Some labour and attention necessary, too, with a coal fire or close stove,
may be saved; and, besides this, it may, perhaps, be said that culinary operations are reduced,
by this means, to something like a certainty.

576. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, WE THINK, MANY OBJECTIONS to this mode of cooking, more especially
when applied to small domestic establishments. For instance, the ingenious machinery necessary
for carrying it out, requires cooks perfectly conversant with its use; and if the gas, when
the cooking operations are finished, be not turned off, there will be a large increase in the
cost of cooking, instead of the economy which it has been supposed to bring. For large establishments,
such as some of the immense London warehouses, where a large number of young men have to be
catered for daily, it may be well adapted, as it is just possible that a slight increase in
the supply of gas necessary for a couple of joints, may serve equally to cook a dozen dishes.

ROASTING.

577. OF THE VARIOUS METHODS OF PREPARING MEAT, ROASTING is that which most effectually preserves
its nutritive qualities. Meat is roasted by being exposed to the direct influence of the fire.
This is done by placing the meat before an open grate, and keeping it in motion to prevent
the scorching on any particular part. When meat is properly roasted, the outer layer of its
albumen is coagulated, and thus presents a barrier to the exit of the juice. In roasting meat,
the heat must be strongest at first, and it should then be much reduced. To have a good juicy
roast, therefore, the fire must be red and vigorous at the very commencement of the operation.
In the most careful roasting, some of the juice is squeezed out of the meat: this evaporates
on the surface of the meat, and gives it a dark brown colour, a rich lustre, and a strong aromatic
taste. Besides these effects on the albumen and the expelled juice, roasting converts the cellular
tissue of the meat into gelatine, and melts the fat out of the fat-cells.

578. IF A SPIT is used to support the meat before the fire, it should be kept quite bright.
Sand and water ought to be used to scour it with, for brickdust and oil may give a disagreeable
taste to the meat. When well scoured, it must be wiped quite dry with a clean cloth; and, in
spitting the meat, the prime parts should be left untouched, so as to avoid any great escape
of its juices.

579. KITCHENS IN LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS are usually fitted with what are termed "smoke-jacks."
By means of these, several spits, if required, may be turned at the same time. This not being,
of course, necessary in smaller establishments, a roasting apparatus, more economical in its
consumption of coal, is more frequently in use.

580. THE BOTTLE-JACK, of which we here give an illustration, with the wheel and hook, and showing
the precise manner of using it, is now commonly used in many kitchens. This consists of a spring
inclosed in a brass cylinder, and requires winding up before it is used, and sometimes, also,
during the operation of roasting. The joint is fixed to an iron hook, which is suspended by
a chain connected with a wheel, and which, in its turn, is connected with the bottle-jack.
Beneath it stands the dripping-pan, which we have also engraved, together with the basting-ladle,
the use of which latter should not be spared; as there can be no good roast without good basting.
"Spare the rod, and spoil the child," might easily be paraphrased into "Spare the basting,
and spoil the meat." If the joint is small and light, and so turns unsteadily, this may be
remedied by fixing to the wheel one of the kitchen weights. Sometimes this jack is fixed inside
a screen; but there is this objection to this apparatus,--that the meat cooked in it resembles
the flavour of baked meat. This is derived from its being so completely surrounded with the
tin, that no sufficient current of air gets to it. It will be found preferable to make use
of a common meat-screen, such as is shown in the woodcut. This contains shelves for warming
plates and dishes; and with this, the reflection not being so powerful, and more air being
admitted to the joint, the roast may be very excellently cooked.

581. IN STIRRING THE FIRE, or putting fresh coals on it, the dripping-pan should always be
drawn back, so that there may be no danger of the coal, cinders, or ashes falling down into it.

582. UNDER EACH PARTICULAR RECIPE there is stated the time required for roasting each joint;
but, as a general rule, it may be here given, that for every pound of meat, in ordinary-sized
joints, a quarter of an hour may be allotted.

583. WHITE MEATS, AND THE MEAT OF YOUNG ANIMALS, require to be very well roasted, both to be
pleasant to the palate and easy of digestion. Thus veal, pork, and lamb, should be thoroughly
done to the centre.

584. MUTTON AND BEEF, on the other hand, do not, generally speaking, require to be so thoroughly
done, and they should be dressed to the point, that, in carving them, the gravy should just
run, but not too freely. Of course in this, as in most other dishes, the tastes of individuals
vary; and there are many who cannot partake, with satisfaction, of any joint unless it is what
others would call overdressed.

QUADRUPEDS.

CHAPTER XII.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON QUADRUPEDS.

585. BY THE GENERAL ASSENT OF MANKIND, THE EMPIRE OF NATURE has been divided into three kingdoms;
the first consisting of minerals, the second of vegetables, and the third of animals. The Mineral
Kingdom comprises all substances which are without those organs necessary to locomotion, and
the due performance of the functions of life. They are composed of the accidental aggregation
of particles, which, under certain circumstances, take a constant and regular figure, but which
are more frequently found without any definite conformation. They also occupy the interior
parts of the earth, as well as compose those huge masses by which we see the land in some parts
guarded against the encroachments of the sea. The Vegetable Kingdom covers and beautifies the
earth with an endless variety of form and colour. It consists of organized bodies, but destitute
of the power of locomotion. They are nourished by means of roots; they breathe by means of
leaves; and propagate by means of seed, dispersed within certain limits. The Animal Kingdom
consists of sentient beings, that enliven the external parts of the earth. They possess the
powers of voluntary motion, respire air, and are forced into action by the cravings of hunger
or the parching of thirst, by the instincts of animal passion, or by pain. Like the vegetable
kingdom, they are limited within the boundaries of certain countries by the conditions of climate
and soil; and some of the species prey upon each other. Linnaeus has divided them into six
classes;--Mammalia, Birds, Fishes, Amphibious Animals, Insects, and Worms. The three latter
do not come within the limits of our domain; of fishes we have already treated, of birds we
shall treat, and of mammalia we will now treat.

586. THIS CLASS OF ANIMALS embraces all those that nourish their young by means of lacteal
glands, or teats, and are so constituted as to have a warm or red blood. In it the whale is
placed,--an order which, from external habits, has usually been classed with the fishes; but,
although this animal exclusively inhabits the water, and is supplied with fins, it nevertheless
exhibits a striking alliance to quadrupeds. It has warm blood, and produces its young alive;
it nourishes them with milk, and, for that purpose, is furnished with teats. It is also supplied
with lungs, and two auricles and two ventricles to the heart; all of which bring it still closer
into an alliance with the quadrupedal species of the animal kingdom.

587. THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAMMALIA have been frequently noticed. The bodies of
nearly the whole species are covered with hair, a kind of clothing which is both soft and warm,
little liable to injury, and bestowed in proportion to the necessities of the animal and the
nature of the climate it inhabits. In all the higher orders of animals, the head is the principal
seat of the organs of sense. It is there that the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the mouth are
placed. Through the last they receive their nourishment. In it are the teeth, which, in most
of the mammalia, are used not only for the mastication of food, but as weapons of offence.
They are inserted into two movable bones called jaws, and the front teeth are so placed that
their sharp edges may easily be brought in contact with their food, in order that its fibres
may readily be separated. Next to these, on each side, are situated the canine teeth, or tusks,
which are longer than the other teeth, and, being pointed, are used to tear the food. In the
back jaws are placed another form of teeth, called grinders. These are for masticating the
food; and in those animals that live on vegetables, they are flattened at the top; but, in
carnivora, their upper surfaces are furnished with sharp-pointed protuberances. From the numbers,
form, and disposition of the teeth, the various genera of quadrupeds have been arranged. The
nose is a cartilaginous body, pierced with two holes, which are called nostrils. Through these
the animal is affected by the sense of smell; and in some it is prominent, whilst in others
it is flat, compressed, turned upwards, or bent downwards. In beasts of prey, it is frequently
longer than the lips; and in some other animals it is elongated into a movable trunk or proboscis,
whilst, in the rhinoceros tribe, it is armed with a horn. The eyes of quadrupeds are generally
defended by movable lids, on the outer margins of which are fringes of hair, called eyelashes.
The opening of the pupil is in general circular; but to some species, as in those of the Cat
and Hare, it is contracted into a perpendicular line, whilst in the Horse, the Ox, and a few
others, it forms a transverse bar. The ears are openings, generally accompanied with a cartilage
which defends and covers them, called the external ears. In water-animals the latter are wanting;
sound, in them, being transmitted merely through orifices in the head, which have the name
of auditory-holes. The most defenceless animals are extremely delicate in the sense of hearing,
as are likewise most beasts of prey. Most of the mammiferous animals walk on four feet, which,
at the extremities, are usually divided into toes or fingers. In some, however, the feet end
in a single corneous substance called a hoof. The toes of a few end in broad, flat nails, and
of most others, in pointed claws. Some, again, have the toes connected by a membrane, which
is adapted to those that are destined to pass a considerable portion of their lives in water.
Others, again, as in the Bat, have the digitations of the anterior feet greatly elongated,
the intervening space being filled by a membrane, which extends round the hinder legs and tail,
and by means of which they are enabled to rise into the air. In Man, the hand alone comprises
fingers, separate, free, and flexible; but Apes, and some other kinds of animals, have fingers
both to the hands and feet. These, therefore, are the only animals that can hold movable objects
in a single hand. Others, such as Rats and Squirrels, have the fingers sufficiently small and
flexible to enable them to pick up objects; but they are compelled to hold them in both hands.
Others, again, have the toes shorter, and must rest on the fore-feet, as is the case with dogs
and cats when they wish to hold a substance firmly on the ground with their paws. There are
still others that have their toes united and drawn under the skin, or enveloped in corneous
hoofs, and are thereby enabled to exercise no prehensile power whatever.

588. ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN AND END OF NATURE, mammiferous animals are calculated, when arrived
at maturity, to subsist on various kinds of food,--some to live wholly upon flesh, others upon
grain, herbs, or fruits; but in their infant state, milk is the appropriate food of the whole.
That this food may never fail them, it is universally ordained, that the young should no sooner
come into the world, than the milk should flow in abundance into the members with which the
mother is supplied for the secretion of that nutritious fluid. By a wonderful instinct of Nature,
too, the young animal, almost as soon as it has come into life, searches for the teat, and
knows perfectly, at the first, how, by the process of suction, it will be able to extract the
fluid necessary to its existence.

589. IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY OF NATURE, this class of animals seems destined to preserve a constant
equilibrium in the number of animated beings that hold their existence on the surface of the
earth. To man they are immediately useful in various ways. Some of their bodies afford him
food, their skin shoes, and their fleece clothes. Some of them unite with him in participating
the dangers of combat with an enemy, and others assist him in the chase, in exterminating wilder
sorts, or banishing them from the haunts of civilization. Many, indeed, are injurious to him;
but most of them, in some shape or other, he turns to his service. Of these there is none he
has made more subservient to his purposes than the common ox, of which there is scarcely a
part that he has not been able to convert into some useful purpose. Of the horns he makes drinking-vessels,
knife-handles, combs, and boxes; and when they are softened by means of boiling water, he fashions
them into transparent plates for lanterns. This invention is ascribed to King Alfred, who is
said to have been the first to use them to preserve his candle time-measures from the wind.
Glue is made of the cartilages, gristles, and the finer pieces of the parings and cuttings
of the hides. Their bone is a cheap substitute for ivory. The thinnest of the calf-skins are
manufactured into vellum. Their blood is made the basis of Prussian blue, and saddlers use
a fine sort of thread prepared from their sinews. The hair is used in various valuable manufactures;
the suet, fat, and tallow, are moulded into candles; and the milk and cream of the cow yield
butter and cheese. Thus is every part of this animal valuable to man, who has spared no pains
to bring it to the highest state of perfection.

590. AMONG THE VARIOUS BREEDS OF THE OX, upon which man has bestowed his highest powers of
culture, there is now none takes a higher place than that known by the name of Short-Horns.
From the earliest ages, Great Britain has been distinguished for the excellence of her native
breeds of cattle, and there are none in England that have obtained greater celebrity than those
which have this name, and which originated, about seventy years ago, on the banks of the Tees.
Thence they have spread into the valleys of the Tweed; thence to the Lothians, in Scotland;
and southward, into the fine pastures of England. They are now esteemed the most profitable
breed of cattle, as there is no animal which attains sooner to maturity, and none that supplies
meat of a superior quality. The value of some of the improved breeds is something enormous.
At the sale of Mr. Charles Colling, a breeder in Yorkshire, in 1810, his bull "Comet" sold
for 1,000 guineas. At the sale of Earl Spencer's herd in 1846, 104 cows, heifers, and calves,
with nineteen bulls, fetched £8,468. 5s.; being an average of £68. 17s. apiece. The value of
such animals is scarcely to be estimated by those who are unacquainted with the care with which
they are tended, and with the anxious attention which is paid to the purity of their breed.
A modern writer, well acquainted with this subject, says, "There are now, at least, five hundred
herds, large and small, in this kingdom, and from six to seven thousand head registered every
alternate year in the herd-book." The necessity for thus recording the breeds is greater than
might, at first sight, be imagined, as it tends directly to preserve the character of the cattle,
while it sometimes adds to the value and reputation of the animal thus entered. Besides, many
of the Americans, and large purchasers for the foreign market, will not look at an animal without
the breeder has taken care to qualify him for such reference. Of short-horned stock, there
is annually sold from £40,000 to £50,000 worth by public auction, independent of the vast numbers
disposed of by private contract. The brood is highly prized in Belgium, Prussia, France, Italy,
and Russia; it is imported into most of the British colonies, and is greatly esteemed both
for its meat and its dairy produce, wherever it is known. The quickness with which it takes
on flesh, and the weight which it frequently makes, are well known; but we may mention that
it is not uncommon to tee steers of from four to five years old realize a weight of from 800
to 1,000 lbs. Such animals command from the butcher from £30 to £40 per head, according to
the quality; whilst others, of two or three years old, and, of course, of less Weight, bring
as much as £20 apiece.

591. LONG-HORNS.--This is the prevailing breed in our midland counties and in Ireland; but
they are greatly inferior to the short-horns, and are fast being supplanted by them. Even where
they have been cultivated with the nicest care and brought to the greatest perfection, they
are inferior to the others, and must ultimately be driven from the farm.

592. THE ALDERNEY.--Among the dairy breeds of England, the Alderney takes a prominent place,
not on account of the quantity of milk which it yields, but on account of the excellent quality
of the cream and butter which are produced from it. Its docility is marvellous, and in appearance
it greatly resembles the Ayrshire breed of Scotland, the excellence of which is supposed to
be, in some degree, derived from a mixture of the Alderney blood with that breed. The distinction
between them, however, lies both in the quantity and quality of the milk which they severally
produce; that of the Alderney being rich in quality, and that of the Ayrshire abundant in quantity.
The merit of the former, however, ends with its milk, for as a grazer it is worthless.

593. SCOTTISH BREEDS.--Of these the Kyloe, which belongs to the Highlands of Scotland; the
Galloway, which has been called the Kyloe without horns; and the Ayrshire, are the breeds most
celebrated. The first has kept his place, and on account of the compactness of his form, and
the excellent quality of his flesh, he is a great favourite with butchers who have a select
family trade. It is alike unsuitable for the dairy and the arable farm; but in its native Highlands
it attains to great perfection, thriving upon the scanty and coarse herbage which it gathers
on the sides of the mountains. The Galloway has a larger frame, and when fattened makes excellent
beef. But it has given place to the short-horns in its native district, where turnip-husbandry
is pursued with advantage. The Ayrshire is peculiarly adapted for the dairy, and for the abundance
of its milk cannot be surpassed in its native district. In this it stands unrivalled, and there
is no other breed capable of converting the produce of a poor soil into such fine butter and
cheese. It is difficult to fatten, however, and its beef is of a coarse quality. We have chosen
these as among the principal representative breeds of the ox species; but there are other breeds
which, at all events, have a local if not a general celebrity.

594. The general Mode of Slaughtering Oxen in this country is by striking them a smart blow
with a hammer or poleaxe on the head, a little above the eyes. By this means, when the blow
is skilfully given, the beast is brought down at one blow, and, to prevent recovery, a cane
is generally inserted, by which the spinal cord is perforated, which instantly deprives the
ox of all sensation of pain. In Spain, and some other countries on the continent, it is also
usual to deprive oxen of life by the operation of pithing or dividing the spinal cord in the
neck, close to the back part of the head. This is, in effect, the same mode as is practised
in the celebrated Spanish bull-fights by the matador, and it is instantaneous in depriving
the animal of sensation, if the operator be skilful. We hope and believe that those men whose
disagreeable duty it is to slaughter the "beasts of the field" to provide meat for mankind,
inflict as little punishment and cause as little suffering as possible.

595. THE MANNER IN WHICH A SIDE OF BEEF is cut up in London, is shown in the engraving on this
page. In the metropolis, on account of the large number of its population possessing the means
to indulge in the "best of everything," the demand for the most delicate joints of meat is
great, the price, at the same time, being much higher for these than for the other parts. The
consequence is, that in London the carcass is there divided so as to obtain the greatest quantity
of meat on the most esteemed joints. In many places, however, where, from a greater equality
in the social condition and habits of the inhabitants, the demand and prices for the different
parts of the carcasses are more equalized, there is not the same reason for the butcher to
cut the best joints so large.

596. THE MEAT ON THOSE PARTS OF THE ANIMAL in which the muscles are least called into action,
is most tender and succulent; as, for instance, along the back, from the rump to the hinder
part of the shoulder; whilst the limbs, shoulder, and neck, are the toughest, driest, and least-esteemed.

597. THE NAMES OF THE SEVERAL JOINTS in the hind and fore quarters of a side of beef, and the
purposes for which they are used, are as follows:--

HIND QUARTER.

1. Sirloin.--The two sirloins, cut together in one joint, form a baron; this, when roasted,
is the famous national dish of Englishmen, at entertainments, on occasion of rejoicing.

2. Rump,--the finest part for steaks.

3. Aitch-bone,--boiling piece.

4. Buttock,--prime boiling piece.

5. Mouse-round,--boiling or stewing.

6. Hock,--stewing.

7. Thick flank, cut with the udder-fat,--primest boiling piece.

8. Thin flank,--boiling.

FORE QUARTER.

9. Five ribs, called the fore-rib.--This is considered the primest roasting piece.

10. Four ribs, called the middle-rib,--greatly esteemed by housekeepers as the most economical
joint for roasting.

11. Two ribs, called the chuck-rib,--used for second quality of steaks.

12. Leg-of-mutton piece,--the muscles of the shoulder dissected from the breast.

13. Brisket, or breast,--used for boiling, after being salted.

14. Neck, clod, and sticking-piece,--used for soups, gravies, stocks, pies, and mincing for
sausages.

15. Shin,--stewing.

The following is a classification of the qualities of meat, according to the several joints
of beef, when cut up in the London manner.

First class.--includes the sirloin, with the kidney suet (1), the rump-steak piece (2), the
fore-rib (9).

Second class.--The buttock (4), the thick flank (7), the middle-rib (10).

Third class.--The aitch-bone (3), the mouse-round (5), the thin flank (8), the chuck (11),
the leg-of-mutton piece (12), the brisket (13).

Fourth class.--The neck, clod, and sticking-piece (14).

Fifth class.--The hock (6), the shin (15).

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XIII.

BAKED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).

I.

598. INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs. of cold roast beef, 2 small onions, 1 large carrot or two small
ones, 1 turnip, a small bunch of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls
of gravy, 3 tablespoonfuls of ale, crust or mashed potatoes.

Mode.--Cut the beef in slices, allowing a small amount of fat to each slice; place a layer
of this in the bottom of a pie-dish, with a portion of the onions, carrots, and turnips, which
must be sliced; mince the herbs, strew them over the meat, and season with pepper and salt.
Then put another layer of meat, vegetables, and seasoning; and proceed in this manner until
all the ingredients are used. Pour in the gravy and ale (water may be substituted for the former,
but it is not so nice), cover with a crust or mashed potatoes, and bake for 1/2 hour, or rather
longer.

Time.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 6d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--It is as well to parboil the carrots and turnips before adding them to the meat, and
to use some of the liquor in which they were boiled as a substitute for gravy; that is to say,
when there is no gravy at hand. Be particular to cut the onions in very thin slices.

II.

599. INGREDIENTS.--Slices of cold roast beef, salt and pepper to taste, 1 sliced onion, 1 teaspoonful
of minced savoury herbs, 5 or 6 tablespoonfuls of gravy or sauce of any kind, mashed potatoes.

Mode.--Butter the sides of a deep dish, and spread mashed potatoes over the bottom of it; on
this place layers of beef in thin slices (this may be minced if there is not sufficient beef
to cut into slices), well seasoned with pepper and salt, and a very little onion end herbs,
which should be previously fried of a nice brown; then put another layer of mashed potatoes,
and beef, and other ingredients, as before; pour in the gravy or sauce, cover the whole with
another layer of potatoes, and bake for 1/2 hour. This may be served in the dish, or turned out.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the cold beef, 6d.

Sufficient.--A large pie-dish full for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    BEEF.--The quality of beef depends on various circumstances;
    such as the age, the sex, the breed of the animal, and also on
    the food upon which it has been raised. Bull beef is, in
    general, dry and tough, and by no means possessed of an
    agreeable flavour; whilst the flesh of the ox is not only highly
    nourishing and digestible, but, if not too old, extremely
    agreeable. The flesh of the cow is, also, nourishing, but it is
    not so agreeable as that of the ox, although that of a heifer is
    held in high estimation. The flesh of the smaller breeds is much
    sweeter than that of the larger, which is best when the animal
    is about seven years old. That of the smaller breeds is best at
    about five years, and that of the cow can hardly be eaten too
    young.

BAKED BEEF-STEAK PUDDING.

600. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of flour, 2 eggs, not quite 1 pint of milk, salt to taste, 1-1/2 lb.
of rump-steaks, 1 kidney, pepper and salt.

Mode.--Cut the steaks into nice square pieces, with a small quantity of fat, and the kidney
divide into small pieces. Make a batter of flour, eggs, and milk in the above proportion; lay
a little of it at the bottom of a pie-dish; then put in the steaks and kidney, which should
be well seasoned with pepper and salt, and pour over the remainder of the batter, and bake
for 1-1/2 hour in a brisk but not fierce oven.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

BEEF A LA MODE.

(Economical.)

601. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of clod or sticking of beef, 2 oz. of clarified dripping, 1
large onion, flour, 2 quarts of water, 12 berries of allspice, 2 bay-leaves, 1/2 teaspoonful
of whole black pepper, salt to taste.

Mode.--Cut the beef into small pieces, and roll them in flour; put the dripping into a stewpan
with the onion, which should be sliced thin. Let it get quite hot; lay in the pieces of beef,
and stir them well about. When nicely browned all over, add by degrees boiling water in the
above proportion, and, as the water is added, keep the whole well stirred. Put in the spice,
bay-leaves, and seasoning, cover the stewpan closely, and set it by the side of the fire to
stew very gently, till the meat becomes quite tender, which will be in about 3 hours, when
it will be ready to serve. Remove the bay-leaves before it is sent to table.

Time.--3 hours.

Average cost, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

BEEF A LA MODE.

602. INGREDIENTS.--6 or 7 lbs. of the thick flank of beef, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 teacupful
of vinegar, black pepper, allspice, 2 cloves well mixed and finely pounded, making altogether
1 heaped teaspoonful; salt to taste, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, all finely
minced and well mixed; 3 onions, 2 large carrots, 1 turnip, 1 head of celery, 1-1/2 pint of
water, 1 glass of port wine.

Mode.--Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown, and cut up the other vegetables in small pieces,
and prepare the beef for stewing in the following manner:--Choose a fine piece of beef, cut
the bacon into long slices, about an inch in thickness, dip them into vinegar, and then into
a little of the above seasoning of spice, &c., mixed with the same quantity of minced herbs.
With a sharp knife make holes deep enough to let in the bacon; then rub the beef over with
the remainder of the seasoning and herbs, and bind it up in a nice shape with tape. Have ready
a well-tinned stewpan (it should not be much larger than the piece of meat you are cooking),
into which put the beef, with the vegetables, vinegar, and water. Let it simmer very gently
for 5 hours, or rather longer, should the meat not be extremely tender, and turn it once or
twice. When ready to serve, take out the beef, remove the tape, and put it on a hot dish. Skim
off every particle of fat from the gravy, add the port wine, just let it boil, pour it over
the beef, and it is ready to serve. Great care must be taken that this does not boil fast,
or the meat will be tough and tasteless; it should only just bubble. When convenient, all kinds
of stews, &c., should be cooked on a hot-plate, as the process is so much more gradual than
on an open fire.

Time.--5 hours, or rather more.

Average cost, 7d. per lb.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but more suitable for a winter dish.

    GOOD MEAT.--The lyer of meat when freshly killed, and the
    animal, when slaughtered, being in a state of perfect health,
    adheres firmly to the bones. Beef of the best quality is of a
    deep-red colour; and when the animal has approached maturity,
    and been well fed, the lean is intermixed with fat, giving it
    the mottled appearance which is so much esteemed. It is also
    full of juice, which resembles in colour claret wine. The fat of
    the best beef is of a firm and waxy consistency, of a colour
    resembling that of the finest grass butter; bright in
    appearance, neither greasy nor friable to the touch, but
    moderately unctuous, in a medium degree between the
    last-mentioned properties.

BEEF-STEAKS AND OYSTER SAUCE.

603. INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, ingredients for oyster sauce (see No. 492), 2 lbs. of rump-steak,
seasoning to taste of pepper and salt.

Mode.--Make the oyster sauce by recipe No. 492, and when that is ready, put it by the side
of the fire, but do not let it keep boiling. Have the steaks cut of an equal thickness, broil
them over a very clear fire, turning them often, that the gravy may not escape. In about 8
minutes they will be done, then put them on a very hot dish; smother with the oyster sauce,
and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Serve quickly.

Time.--About 8 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the steak.

Average cost, 1s. per lb.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable from September to April.

BEEF-STEAK PIE.

604. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of rump-steak, seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne, and black pepper,
crust, water, the yolk of an egg.

Mode.--Have the steaks cut from a rump that has hung a few days, that they may be tender, and
be particular that every portion is perfectly sweet. Cut the steaks into pieces about 3 inches
long and 2 wide, allowing a small piece of fat to each piece of lean, and arrange the meat
in layers in a pie-dish. Between each layer sprinkle a seasoning of salt, pepper, and, when
liked, a few grains of cayenne. Fill the dish sufficiently with meat to support the crust,
and to give it a nice raised appearance when baked, and not to look flat and hollow. Pour in
sufficient water to half fill the dish, and border it with paste (see Pastry); brush it over
with a little water, and put on the cover; slightly press down the edges with the thumb, and
trim off close to the dish. Ornament the pie with leaves, or pieces of paste cut in any shape
that fancy may direct, brush it over with the beaten yolk of an egg; make a hole in the top
of the crust, and bake in a hot oven for about 1-1/2 hour.

Time.--In a hot oven, 1-1/2 hour.

Average cost, for this size, 3s 6d.

Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Beef-steak pies may be flavoured in various ways, with oysters and their liquor, mushrooms,
minced onions, &c. For family pies, suet may be used instead of butter or lard for the crust,
and clarified beef-dripping answers very well where economy is an object. Pieces of underdone
roast or boiled meat may in pies be used very advantageously; but always remove the bone from
pie-meat, unless it be chicken or game. We have directed that the meat shall be cut smaller
than is usually the case; for on trial we have found it much more tender, more easily helped,
and with more gravy, than when put into the dish in one or two large steaks.

BEEF-STEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING.

605. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, 2 kidneys, seasoning to taste of salt and black pepper,
suet crust made with milk (see Pastry), in the proportion of 6 oz. of suet to each 1 lb. of flour.

Mode.--Procure some tender rump steak (that which has been hung a little time), and divide
it into pieces about an inch square, and cut each kidney into 8 pieces. Line the dish (of which
we have given an engraving) with crust made with suet and flour in the above proportion, leaving
a small piece of crust to overlap the edge. Then cover the bottom with a portion of the steak
and a few pieces of kidney; season with salt and pepper (some add a little flour to thicken
the gravy, but it is not necessary), and then add another layer of steak, kidney, and seasoning.
Proceed in this manner till the dish is full, when pour in sufficient water to come within
2 inches of the top of the basin. Moisten the edges of the crust, cover the pudding over, press
the two crusts together, that the gravy may not escape, and turn up the overhanging paste.
Wring out a cloth in hot water, flour it, and tie up the pudding; put it into boiling water,
and let it boil for at least 4 hours. If the water diminishes, always replenish with some,
hot in a jug, as the pudding should be kept covered all the time, and not allowed to stop boiling.
When the cloth is removed, cut out a round piece in the top of the crust, to prevent the pudding
bursting, and send it to table in the basin, either in an ornamental dish, or with a napkin
pinned round it. Serve quickly.

Time.--For a pudding with 2 lbs. of steak and 2 kidneys allow 4 hours.

Average cost, 2s. 8d.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but more suitable in winter.

Note.--Beef-steak pudding may be very much enriched by adding a few oysters or mushrooms. The
above recipe was contributed to this work by a Sussex lady, in which county the inhabitants
are noted for their savoury puddings. It differs from the general way of making them, as the
meat is cut up into very small pieces and the basin is differently shaped: on trial, this pudding
will be found far nicer, and more full of gravy, than when laid in large pieces in the dish.

    BAD MEAT. In the flesh of animals slaughtered whilst suffering
    acute inflammation or fever, the hollow fibres, or capillaries,
    as they are called, which form the substance of the lyer, are
    filled with congested and unassimilated animal fluid, which,
    from its impurity, gives the lyer a dark colour, and produces a
    tendency to rapid putrefaction. In a more advanced stage of such
    disease, serous, and sometimes purulent matter, is formed in the
    cellular tissues between the muscles of the flesh; and when such
    is the case, nothing can be more poisonous than such abominable
    carrion. In the flesh of animals killed whilst under the
    influence of any disease of an emaciating effect, the lyer
    adheres but slightly to the bones, with its fibres contracted
    and dry; and the little fat that there may be is friable, and
    shrunk within its integuments. The flesh of animals slaughtered
    whilst under considerable depression of vital energy (as from
    previous bleeding) has a diminished tendency to stiffen after
    death, the feebleness of this tendency being in proportion to
    the degree of depression. It presents, also, an unnatural blue
    or pallid appearance, has a faint and slightly sour smell, and
    soon becomes putrid. When an animal has died otherwise than by
    slaughtering, its flesh is flaccid and clammy, emits a peculiar
    faint and disagreeable smell, and, it need scarcely be added,
    spontaneous decomposition proceeds very rapidly.

BEEF-STEAKS WITH FRIED POTATOES, or BIFTEK AUX POMMES-DE-TERRE (a la mode Francaise).

606. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of steak, 8 potatoes, 1/4 lb. of butter, salt and pepper to taste,
1 teaspoonful of minced herbs.

Mode.--Put the butter into a frying or sauté pan, set it over the fire, and let it get very
hot; peel, and cut the potatoes into long thin slices; put them into the hot butter, and fry
them till of a nice brown colour. Now broil the steaks over a bright clear fire, turning them
frequently, that every part may be equally done: as they should not be thick, 5 minutes will
broil them. Put the herbs and seasoning in the butter the potatoes were fried in, pour it under
the steak, and place the fried potatoes round, as a garnish. To have this dish in perfection,
a portion of the fillet of the sirloin should be used, as the meat is generally so much more
tender than that of the rump, and the steaks should be cut about 1/3 of an inch in thickness.

Time.--5 minutes to broil the steaks, and about the same time to fry the potatoes.

BOILED AITCH-BONE OF BEEF.

607. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, water.

Mode.--After this joint has been in salt 5 or 6 days, it will be ready for use, and will not
take so long boiling: as a round, for it is not so solid. Wash the meat, and, if too salt,
soak it for a few hours, changing the water once or twice, till the required freshness is obtained.
Put into a saucepan, or boiling-pot, sufficient water to cover the meat; set it over the fire,
and when it boils, plunge in the joint (see No. 557), and let it boil up quickly. Now draw
the pot to the side of the fire, and let the process be very gradual, as the water must only
simmer, or the meat will be hard and tough. Carefully remove the scum from the surface of the
water, and continue doing this for a few minutes after it first boils. Carrots and turnips
are served with this dish, and sometimes suet dumplings, which may be boiled with the beef.
Garnish with a few of the carrots and turnips, and serve the remainder in a vegetable-dish.

Time.--An aitch-bone of 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours after the water boils; one of 20 lbs., 4 hours.
Average cost, 6d. per lb.

Sufficient.--10 lbs. for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but best from September to March.

Note.--The liquor in which the meat has been boiled may be easily converted into a very excellent
pea-soup. It will require very few vegetables, as it will be impregnated with the flavour of
those boiled with the meat.

    THE ACTION OF SALT ON MEAT.--The manner in which salt acts in
    preserving meat is not difficult to understand. By its strong
    affinity, it, in the first place, extracts the juices from the
    substance of meat in sufficient quantity to form a saturated
    solution with the water contained in the juice, and the meat
    then absorbs the saturated brine in place of the juice extracted
    by the salt. In this way, matter incapable of putrefaction takes
    the places of that portion in the meat which is most perishable.
    Such, however, is not the only office of salt as a means of
    preserving meat; it acts also by its astringency in contracting
    the fibres of the muscles, and so excludes the action of air on
    the interior of the substance of the meat. The last-mentioned
    operation of salt as an antiseptic is evinced by the diminution
    of the volume of meat to which it is applied. The astringent
    action of saltpetre on meat is much greater than that of salt,
    and thereby renders meat to which it is applied very hard; but,
    in small quantities, it considerably assists the antiseptic
    action of salt, and also prevents the destruction of the florid
    colour of meat, which is caused by the application of salt.
    Thus, it will be perceived, from the foregoing statement, that
    the application of salt and saltpetre diminishes, in a
    considerable degree, the nutritive, and, to some extent, the
    wholesome qualities of meat; and, therefore, in their use, the
    quantity applied should be as small as possible, consistent with
    the perfect preservation of the meat.

BOILED ROUND OF BEEF.

608. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, water.

Mode.--As a whole round of beef, generally speaking, is too large for small families, and very
seldom required, we here give the recipe for dressing a portion of the silver side of the round.
Take from 12 to 16 lbs., after it has been in salt about 10 days; just wash off the salt, skewer
it up in a nice round-looking form, and bind it with tape to keep the skewers in their places.
Put it in a saucepan of boiling water, as in the preceding recipe, set it upon a good fire,
and when it begins to boil, carefully remove all scum from the surface, as, if this is not
attended to, it sinks on to the meat, and when brought to table, presents a very unsightly
appearance. When it is well skimmed, draw the pot to the corner of the fire, and let it simmer
very gently until done. Remove the tape and skewers, which should be replaced by a silver one;
pour over a little of the pot-liquor, and garnish with carrots. (See coloured plate 2.) Carrots,
turnips, parsnips, and sometimes suet dumplings, accompany this dish; and these may all be
boiled with the beef. The pot-liquor should be saved, and converted into pea-soup; and the
outside slices, which are generally hard, and of an uninviting appearance, may be out off before
being sent to table, and potted. These make an excellent relish for the breakfast or luncheon
table.

Time.--Part of a round of beef weighing 12 lbs., about 3 hours after the water boils. Average
cost, 8d. per lb.

Sufficient for 10 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but more suitable for winter.

609. SOYER'S RECIPE FOR PRESERVING THE GRAVY IN SALT MEAT, WHEN IT IS TO BE SERVED COLD.--Fill
two tubs with cold water, into which throw a few pounds of rough ice; and when the meat is
done, put it into one of the tubs of ice-water; let it remain 1 minute, when take out, and
put it into the other tub. Fill the first tub again with water, and continue this process for
about 20 minutes; then set it upon a dish, and let it remain until quite cold. When cut, the
fat will be as white as possible, besides having saved the whole, of the gravy. If there is
no ice, spring water will answer the same purpose, but will require to be more frequently changed.

Note.--The BRISKET and RUMP may be boiled by the above recipe; of course allowing more or less
time, according to the size of the joint.

BEEF CAKE.

610. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef; to each pound of cold meat allow 1/4 lb.
of bacon or ham; seasoning to taste of pepper and salt, 1 small bunch of minced savoury herbs,
1 or 2 eggs.

Mode.--Mince the beef very finely (if underdone it will be better), add to it the bacon, which
must also be chopped very small, and mix well together. Season, stir in the herbs, and bind
with an egg, or 2 should 1 not be sufficient. Make it into small square cakes, about 1/2 inch
thick, fry them in hot dripping, and serve in a dish with good gravy poured round them.

Time.--10 minutes.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

BROILED BEEF-STEAKS or RUMP-STEAKS.

611. INGREDIENTS.--Steaks, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful
of good mushroom ketchup or Harvey's sauce.

Mode.--As the success of a good broil so much depends on the state of the fire, see that it
is bright and clear, and perfectly free from smoke, and do not add any fresh fuel just before
you require to use the gridiron. Sprinkle a little salt over the fire, put on the gridiron
for a few minutes, to get thoroughly hot through; rub it with a piece of fresh, suet, to prevent
the meat from sticking, and lay on the steaks, which should be cut of an equal thickness, about
3/4 of an inch, or rather thinner, and level them by beating them as little as possible with
a rolling-pin. Turn them frequently with steak-tongs (if these are not at hand, stick a fork
in the edge of the fat, that no gravy escapes), and in from 8 to 10 minutes they will be done.
Have ready a very hot dish, into which put the ketchup, and, when liked, a little minced shalot;
dish up the steaks, rub them over with butter, and season with pepper and salt. The exact time
for broiling steaks must be determined by taste, whether they are liked underdone or well done;
more than from 8 to 10 minutes for a steak 3/4 inch in thickness, we think, would spoil and
dry up the juices of the meat. Great expedition is necessary in sending broiled steaks to table;
and, to have them in perfection, they should not be cooked till everything else prepared for
dinner has been dished up, as their excellence entirely depends on their being served very
hot. Garnish with scraped horseradish, or slices of cucumber. Oyster, tomato, onion, and many
other sauces, are frequent accompaniments to rump-steak, but true lovers of this English dish
generally reject all additions but pepper and salt.

Time.--8 to 10 minutes.

Average cost, 1s. per lb.

Sufficient.--Allow 1/2 lb. to each person; if the party consist entirely of gentlemen, 3/4
lb. will not be too much.

Seasonable all the year, but not good in the height of summer, as the meat cannot hang long
enough to be tender.

    DIFFERENT SEASONS FOR BEEF.--We have already stated (see No.
    593) that the Scots breed of oxen, like the South-down in
    mutton, stands first in excellence. It should be borne in mind,
    however, that each county has its particular season, and that
    the London and other large markets are always supplied by those
    counties whose meat, from local circumstances, is in the best
    condition at the time. Thus, the season in Norfolk, from which
    the Scots come (these being the principal oxen bred by the
    Norfolk and Suffolk graziers), commences about Christmas and
    terminates about June, when this breed begins to fall off, their
    place being taken by grass-fed oxen. A large quantity of most
    excellent meat is sent to the "dead markets" from Scotland, and
    some of the best London butchers are supplied from this source.

BROILED BEEF AND MUSHROOM SAUCE.

(Cold Meat Cookery).

612. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 dozen small button mushrooms, 1 oz. of butter, salt and cayenne to
taste, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, mashed potatoes, slices of cold roast beef.

Mode.--Wipe the mushrooms free from grit with a piece of flannel, and salt; put them in a stewpan
with the butter, seasoning, and ketchup; stir over the fire until the mushrooms are quite done,
when pour it in the middle of mashed potatoes, browned. Then place round the potatoes slices
of cold roast beef, nicely broiled, over a clear fire. In making the mushroom sauce, the ketchup
may be dispensed with, if there is sufficient gravy.

Time.--1/4 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 8d.

Seasonable from August to October.

BROILED BEEF AND OYSTER SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery).

613.

Mode.--Put the oysters in a stewpan, with their liquor strained; add the cloves, mace, butter,
flour, and seasoning, and let them simmer gently for 5 minutes. Have ready in the centre of
a dish round walls of mashed potatoes, browned; into the middle pour the oyster sauce, quite
hot, and round the potatoes place, in layers, slices of the beef, which should be previously
broiled over a nice clear fire.

Time.--5 minutes. Average cost, 1s, 6d., exclusive of the cold meat.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from September to April.

BROILED BEEF-BONES.

614. INGREDIENTS.--The bones of ribs or sirloin; salt, pepper, and cayenne.

Mode.--Separate the bones, taking care that the meat on them is not too thick in any part;
sprinkle them well with the above seasoning, and broil over a very clear fire. When nicely
browned they are done; but do not allow them to blacken.

TO DRESS A BULLOCK'S HEART.

615. INGREDIENTS.--1 heart, stuffing of veal forcemeat, No. 417.

Mode.--Put the heart into warm water to soak for 2 hours; then wipe it well with a cloth, and,
after cutting off the lobes, stuff the inside with a highly-seasoned forcemeat (No. 417). Fasten
it in, by means of a needle and coarse thread; tie the heart up in paper, and set it before
a good fire, being very particular to keep it well basted, or it will eat dry, there being
very little of its own fat. Two or three minutes before serving, remove the paper, baste well,
and serve with good gravy and red-currant jelly or melted butter. If the heart is very large,
it will require 2 hours, and, covered with a caul, may be baked as well as roasted.

Time.--Large heart, 2 hours. Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons.

Seasonable all the year.

Note.--This is an excellent family dish, is very savoury, and, though not seen at many good
tables, may be recommended for its cheapness and economy.

BUBBLE-AND-SQUEAK (Cold Meat Cookery).

616. INGREDIENTS.--A few thin slices of cold boiled beef; butter, cabbage, 1 sliced onion,
pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Fry the slices of beef gently in a little butter, taking care not to dry them up. Lay
them on a flat dish, and cover with fried greens. The greens may be prepared from cabbage sprouts
or green savoys. They should be boiled till tender, well drained, minced, and placed, till
quite hot, in a frying-pan, with butter, a sliced onion, and seasoning of pepper and salt.
When the onion is done, it is ready to serve.

Seasonable at any time.

COLLARED BEEF.

617. INGREDIENTS.--7 lbs. of the thin end of the flank of beef, 2 oz. of coarse sugar, 6 oz.
of salt, 1 oz, of saltpetre, 1 large handful of parsley minced, 1 dessertspoonful of minced
sage, a bunch of savoury herbs, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded allspice; salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Choose fine tender beef, but not too fat; lay it in a dish; rub in the sugar, salt,
and saltpetre, and let it remain in the pickle for a week or ten days, turning and rubbing
it every day. Then bone it, remove all the gristle and the coarse skin of the inside part,
and sprinkle it thickly with parsley, herbs, spice, and seasoning in the above proportion,
taking care that the former are finely minced, and the latter well pounded. Roll the meat up
in a cloth as tightly as possible, in the same shape as shown in the engraving; bind it firmly
with broad tape, and boil it gently for 6 hours. Immediately on taking it out of the pot, put
it under a good weight, without undoing it, and let it remain until cold. This dish is a very
nice addition to the breakfast-table.

Time.--6 hours. Average cost, for this quantity, 4s.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--During the time the beef is in pickle, it should be kept cool, and regularly rubbed
and turned every day.

BEEF-COLLOPS.

618. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1 pint of gravy (water may be substituted
for this), salt and pepper to taste, 1 shalot finely minced, 1/2 pickled walnut, 1 teaspoonful
of capers.

Mode.--Have the steak cut thin, and divide it in pieces about 3 inches long; beat these with
the blade of a knife, and dredge with flour. Put them in a frying-pan with the butter, and
let them fry for about 3 minutes; then lay them in a small stewpan, and pour over them the
gravy. Add a piece of butter, kneaded with a little flour, put in the seasoning and all the
other ingredients, and let the whole simmer, but not boil, for 10 minutes. Serve in a hot covered
dish.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, 1s. per lb.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

MINCED COLLOPS (an Entree).

619. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of rump-steak, salt and pepper to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 1 onion
minced, 1/4 pint of water, 1 tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce, or lemon-juice, or mushroom ketchup;
1 small bunch of savoury herbs.

Mode.--Mince the beef and onion very small, and fry the latter in butter until of a pale brown.
Put all the ingredients together in a stewpan, and boil gently for about 10 minutes; garnish
with sippets of toasted bread, and serve very hot.

Seasonable at any time.

CURRIED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).

620. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of tolerably lean cold roast or boiled beef, 3 oz. of butter,
2 onions, 1 wineglassful of beer, 1 dessertspoonful of curry powder.

Mode.--Cut up the beef into pieces about 1 inch square, put the butter into a stewpan with
the onions sliced, and fry them of a lightly-brown colour. Add all the other ingredients, and
stir gently over a brisk fire for about 10 minutes. Should this be thought too dry, more beer,
or a spoonful or two of gravy or water, may be added; but a good curry should not be very thin.
Place it in a deep dish, with an edging of dry boiled rice, in the same manner as for other
curries.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 4d.

Seasonable in winter.

TO CLARIFY BEEF DRIPPING.

I.

621. Good and fresh dripping answers very well for basting everything except game and poultry,
and, when well clarified, serves for frying nearly as well as lard; it should be kept in a
cool place, and will remain good some time. To clarify it, put the dripping into a basin, pour
over it boiling water, and keep stirring the whole to wash away the impurities. Let it stand
to cool, when the water and dirty sediment will settle at the bottom of the basin. Remove the
dripping, and put it away in jars or basins for use.

ANOTHER WAY.

622. Put the dripping into a clean saucepan, and let it boil for a few minutes over a slow
fire, and be careful to skim it well. Let it stand to cool a little, then strain it through
a piece of muslin into jars for use. Beef dripping is preferable to any other for cooking purposes,
as, with mutton dripping, there is liable to be a tallowy taste and smell.

ROAST FILLET OF BEEF (Larded).

623. INGREDIENTS.--About 4 lbs. of the inside fillet of the sirloin, 1 onion, a small bunch
of parsley, salt and pepper to taste, sufficient vinegar to cover the meat, glaze, Spanish
sauce, No. 411.

Mode.--Lard the beef with bacon, and put it into a pan with sufficient vinegar to cover it,
with an onion sliced, parsley, and seasoning, and let it remain in this pickle for 12 hours.
Roast it before a nice clear fire for about 1-1/4 hour, and, when done, glaze it. Pour some
Spanish sauce round the beef, and the remainder serve in a tureen. It may be garnished with
Spanish onions boiled and glazed.

Time.--1-1/2 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the sauce, 4s.

Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

FRICANDEAU OF BEEF.

624. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the inside fillet of the sirloin (a piece of the rump may
be substituted for this), pepper and salt to taste, 3 cloves, 2 blades of mace, 6 whole allspice,
1 pint of stock No. 105, or water, 1 glass of sherry, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 2 shalots, bacon.

Mode.--Cut some bacon into thin strips, and sprinkle over them a seasoning of pepper and salt,
mixed with cloves, mace, and allspice, well pounded. Lard the beef with these, put it into
a stewpan with the stock or water, sherry, herbs, shalots, 2 cloves, and more pepper and salt.
Stew the meat gently until tender, when take it out, cover it closely, skim off all the fat
from the gravy, and strain it. Set it on the fire, and boil, till it becomes a glaze. Glaze
the larded side of the beef with this, and serve on sorrel sauce, which is made as follows:--Wash
and pick some sorrel, and put it into a stewpan with only the water that hangs about it. Keep
stirring, to prevent its burning, and when done, lay it in a sieve to drain. Chop it, and stew
it with a small piece of butter and 4 or 6 tablespoonfuls of good gravy, for an hour, and rub
it through a tammy. If too acid, add a little sugar; and a little cabbage-lettuce boiled with
the sorrel will be found an improvement.

Time.--2 hours to gently stew the meat.

Average cost, for this quantity, 4s.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

FRIED SALT BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).

625. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold salt beef, pepper to taste, 1/4 lb. of butter, mashed
potatoes.

Mode.--Cut any part of cold salt beef into thin slices, fry them gently in butter, and season
with a little pepper. Have ready some very hot mashed potatoes, lay the slices of beef on them,
and garnish with 3 or 4 pickled gherkins. Cold salt beef, warmed in a little liquor from mixed
pickle, drained, and served as above, will be found good.

Time.--About 5 minutes. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 4d.

Seasonable at any time.

FRIED RUMP-STEAK.

626. INGREDIENTS.--Steaks, butter or clarified dripping.

Mode. Although broiling is a far superior method of cooking steaks to frying them, yet, when
the cook is not very expert, the latter mode may be adopted; and, when properly done, the dish
may really look very inviting, and the flavour be good. The steaks should be cut rather thinner
than for broiling, and with a small quantity of fat to each. Put some butter or clarified dripping
into a frying-pan; let it get quite hot, then lay in the steaks. Turn them frequently until
done, which will be in about 8 minutes, or rather more, should the steaks be very thick. Serve
on a very hot dish, in which put a small piece of butter and a tablespoonful of ketchup, and
season with pepper and salt. They should be sent to table quickly, as, when cold, the steaks
are entirely spoiled.

Time.--8 minutes for a medium-sized steak, rather longer for a very thick one.

Average cost, 1s. per lb.

Seasonable all the year, but not good in summer, as the meat cannot hang to get tender.

Note.--Where much gravy is liked, make it in the following manner:--As soon as the steaks are
done, dish them, pour a little boiling water into the frying-pan, add a seasoning of pepper
and salt, a small piece of butter, and a tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce or mushroom ketchup.
Hold the pan over the fire for a minute or two, just let the gravy simmer, then pour on the
steak, and serve.

    A FRENCHMAN'S OPINION OF BEEF. The following is translated from
    a celebrated modern French work, the production of one who in
    Paris enjoys a great reputation as cook and chemist:--The flesh
    of the ox, to be in the best condition, should be taken from an
    animal of from four to six years old, and neither too fat nor
    too lean. This meat, which possesses in the highest degree the
    most nutritive qualities, is generally easily digested; stock is
    made from it, and it is eaten boiled, broiled, roasted, stewed,
    braised, and in a hundred other different ways. Beef is the
    foundation of stock, gravies, braises, &c.; its nutritious and
    succulent gravy gives body and flavour to numberless ragoûts. It
    is an exhaustless mine in the hands of a skilful artist, and is
    truly the king of the kitchen. Without it, no soup, no gravy;
    and its absence would produce almost a famine in the civilized
    world!

BEEF FRITTERS (Cold Meat Cookery).

627. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef, pepper and salt to taste, 3/4 lb. of flour,
1/2 pint of water, 2 oz. of butter, the whites of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Mix very smoothly, and by degrees, the flour with the above proportion of water; stir
in 2 oz. of butter, which must be melted, but not oiled, and, just before it is to be used,
add the whites of two well-whisked eggs. Should the batter be too thick, more water must be
added. Pare down the cold beef into thin shreds, season with pepper and salt, and mix it with
the batter. Drop a small quantity at a time into a pan of boiling lard, and fry from 7 to 10
minutes, according to the size. When done on one side, turn and brown them on the other. Let
them dry for a minute or two before the fire, and serve on a folded napkin. A small quantity
of finely-minced onions, mixed with the batter, is an improvement.

Time.--From 7 to 10 minutes.

Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 6d. Seasonable at any time.

HASHED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).

I.

628. INGREDIENTS.--Gravy saved from the meat, 1 teaspoonful of tomato sauce, 1 teaspoonful
of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of good mushroom ketchup, 1/2 glass of port wine or strong
ale, pepper and salt to taste, a little flour to thicken, 1 onion finely minced, a few slices
of cold roast beef.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients but the beef into a stewpan with whatever gravy may have been
saved from the meat the day it was roasted; let these simmer gently for 10 minutes, then take
the stewpan off the fire; let the gravy cool, and skim off the fat. Cut the beef into thin
slices, dredge them with flour, and lay them in the gravy; let the whole simmer gently for
5 minutes, but not boil, or the meat will be tough and hard. Serve very hot, and garnish with
sippets of toasted bread.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, 4d.

Seasonable at any time.

II.

629. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of ribs or sirloin of beef, 2 onions, 1 carrot, 1 bunch of savoury
herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 blade of pounded mace, thickening of flour, rather more
than 1 pint of water.

Mode.--Take off all the meat from the bones of ribs or sirloin of beef; remove the outside
brown and gristle; place the meat on one side, and well stew the bones and pieces, with the
above ingredients, for about 2 hours, till it becomes a strong gravy, and is reduced to rather
more than 1/2 pint; strain this, thicken with a teaspoonful of flour, and let the gravy cool;
skim off all the fat; lay in the meat, let it get hot through, but do not allow it to boil,
and garnish with sippets of toasted bread. The gravy may be flavoured as in the preceding recipe.

Time.--Rather more than 2 hours.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, 2d.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Either of the above recipes may be served in walls of mashed potatoes browned; in which
case the sippets should be omitted. Be careful that hashed meat does not boil, or it will become
tough.

TO PREPARE HUNG BEEF.

630. This is preserved by salting and drying, either with or without smoke. Hang up the beef
3 or 4 days, till it becomes tender, but take care it does not begin to spoil; then salt it
in the usual way, either by dry-salting or by brine, with bay-salt, brown sugar, saltpetre,
and a little pepper and allspice; afterwards roll it tight in a cloth, and hang it up in a
warm, but not hot place, for a fortnight or more, till it is sufficiently hard. If required
to have a little of the smoky flavour, it may be hung for some time in a chimney-corner, or
smoked in any other way: it will keep a long time.

HUNTER'S BEEF.

631. INGREDIENTS.--For a round of beef weighing 25 lbs. allow 3 oz. of saltpetre, 3 oz. of
coarse sugar, 1 oz. of cloves, 1 grated nutmeg, 1/2 oz. of allspice, 1 lb. of salt, 1/2 lb.
bay-salt.

Mode.--Let the beef hang for 2 or 3 days, and remove the bone. Pound spices, salt, &c. in the
above proportion, and let them be reduced to the finest powder. Put the beef into a pan, rub
all the ingredients well into it, and turn and rub it every day for rather more than a fortnight.
When it has been sufficiently long in pickle, wash the meat, bind it up securely with tape,
and put it into a pan with 1/2 pint of water at the bottom; mince some suet, cover the top
of the meat with it, and over the pan put a common crust of flour and water; bake for 6 hours,
and, when cold, remove the paste. Save the gravy that flows from it, as it adds greatly to
the flavour of hashes, stews, &c. The beef may be glazed and garnished with meat jelly.

Time.--6 hours.

Seasonable all the year.

Note.--In salting or pickling beef or pork for family consumption, it not being generally required
to be kept for a great length of time, a less quantity of salt and a larger quantity of other
matters more adapted to retain mellowness in meat, may be employed, which could not be adopted
by the curer of the immense quantities of meat required to be preserved for victualling the
shipping of this maritime country. Sugar, which is well known to possess the preserving principle
in a very great degree, without the pungency and astringency of salt, may be, and is, very
generally used in the preserving of meat for family consumption. Although it acts without corrugating
or contracting the fibres of meat, as is the case in the action of salt, and, therefore, does
not impair its mellowness, yet its use in sufficient quantities for preservative effect, without
the addition of other antiseptics, would impart a flavour not agreeable to the taste of many
persons. It may be used, however, together with salt, with the greatest advantage in imparting
mildness and mellowness to cured meat, in a proportion of about one part by weight to four
of the mixture; and, perhaps, now that sugar is so much lower in price than it was in former
years, one of the obstructions to its more frequent use is removed.

TO DRESS BEEF KIDNEY.

I.

632. INGREDIENTS.--1 kidney, clarified butter, pepper and salt to taste, a small quantity of
highly-seasoned gravy, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/4 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.

Mode.--Cut the kidneys into neat slices, put them into warm water to soak for 2 hours, and
change the water 2 or 3 times; then put them on a clean cloth to dry the water from them, and
lay them in a frying-pan with some clarified butter, and fry them of a nice brown; season each
side with pepper and salt, put them round the dish, and the gravy in the middle. Before pouring
the gravy in the dish, add the lemon-juice and sugar.

Time.--From 5 to 10 minutes. Average cost, 9d. each.

Seasonable at any time.

II.

633. INGREDIENTS.--1 kidney, 1 dessertspoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot,
salt and pepper to taste, 1/4 pint of gravy, No. 438, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry.

Mode.--Take off a little of the kidney fat, mince it very fine, and put it in a frying-pan;
slice the kidney, sprinkle over it parsley and shalots in the above proportion, add a seasoning
of pepper and salt, and fry it of a nice brown. When it is done enough, dredge over a little
flour, and pour in the gravy and sherry. Let it just simmer, but not boil any more, or the
kidney would harden; serve very hot, and garnish with croûtons. Where the flavour of the shalot
is disliked, it may be omitted, and a small quantity of savoury herbs substituted for it. Time.--From
5 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the slices.

Average cost, 9d. each. Sufficient for 3 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

III.

A more Simple Method.

634. Cut the kidney into thin slices, flour them, and fry of a nice brown. When done, make
a gravy in the pan by pouring away the fat, putting in a small piece of butter, 1/4 pint of
boiling water, pepper and salt, and a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup. Let the gravy just
boil up, pour over the kidney, and serve.

BOILED MARROW-BONES.

635. INGREDIENTS.--Bones, a small piece of common paste, a floured cloth.

Mode.--Have the bones neatly sawed into convenient sizes, and cover the ends with a small piece
of common crust, made with flour and water. Over this tie a floured cloth, and place them upright
in a saucepan of boiling water, taking care there is sufficient to cover the bones. Boil them
for 2 hours, remove the cloth and paste, and serve them upright on a napkin with dry toast.
Many persons clear the marrow from the bones after they are cooked, spread it over a slice
of toast and add a seasoning of pepper; when served in this manner, it must be very expeditiously
sent to table, as it so soon gets cold.

Time.--2 hours.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Marrow-bones may be baked after preparing them as in the preceding recipe; they should
be laid in a deep dish, and baked for 2 hours.

    MARROW-BONES.--Bones are formed of a dense cellular tissue of
    membranous matter, made stiff and rigid by insoluble earthy
    salts; of which, phosphate of lime is the most abundant. In a
    large bone, the insoluble matter is generally deposited in such
    a manner as to leave a cavity, into which a fatty substance,
    distinguished by the name of marrow, is thrown. Hollow
    cylindrical bones possess the qualities of strength and
    lightness in a remarkable degree. If bones were entirely solid,
    they would be unnecessarily heavy; and if their materials were
    brought into smaller compass, they would be weaker, because the
    strength of a bone is in proportion to the distance at which its
    fibres are from the centre. Some animals, it must, however, be
    observed, have no cavities in the centre of their bones; such as
    the whale tribe, skate, and turtles.

MINCED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).

636. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of butter, 1 small onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of gravy left from the
meat, 1 tablespoonful of strong ale, 1/2 a teaspoonful of flour, salt and pepper to taste,
a few slices of lean roast beef.

Mode.--Put into a stewpan the butter with an onion chopped fine; add the gravy, ale, and 1/2
a teaspoonful of flour to thicken; season with pepper and salt, and stir these ingredients
over the fire until the onion is a rich brown. Cut, but do not chop the meat very fine, add
it to the gravy, stir till quite hot, and serve. Garnish with sippets of toasted bread. Be
careful in not allowing the gravy to boil after the meat is added, as it would render it hard
and tough.

Seasonable at any time.

MIROTON OF BEEF.

637. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold roast beef, 3 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to taste,
3 onions, 1/2 pint of gravy.

Mode.--Slice the onions and put them into a frying-pan with the cold beef and butter; place
it over the fire, and keep turning and stirring the ingredients to prevent them burning. When
of a pale brown, add the gravy and seasoning; let it simmer for a few minutes, and serve very
hot. This dish is excellent and economical.

STEWED OX-CHEEK.

638. INGREDIENTS.--1 cheek, salt and water, 4 or 5 onions, butter and flour, 6 cloves, 3 turnips,
2 carrots, 1 bay-leaf, 1 head of celery, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, cayenne, black pepper and
salt to taste, 1 oz. of butter, 2 dessertspoonfuls of flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of Chili vinegar,
2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of Harvey's
sauce.

Mode.--Have the cheek boned, and prepare it the day before it is to be eaten, by cleaning and
putting it to soak all night in salt and water. The next day, wipe it dry and clean, and put
it into a stewpan. Just cover it with water, skim well when it boils, and let it gently simmer
till the meat is quite tender. Slice and fry 3 onions in a little butter and flour, and put
them into the gravy; add 2 whole onions, each stuck with 3 cloves, 3 turnips quartered, 2 carrots
sliced, a bay-leaf, 1 head of celery, a bunch of herbs, and seasoning to taste of cayenne,
black pepper, and salt. Let these stew till perfectly tender; then take out the cheek, divide
into pieces fit to help at table, skim and strain the gravy, and thicken 1-1/2 pint of it with
butter and flour in the above proportions. Add the vinegar, ketchup, and port wine; put in
the pieces of cheek; let the whole boil up, and serve quite hot. Send it to table in a ragout-dish.
If the colour of the gravy should not be very good, add a tablespoonful of the browning, No. 108.

Time.--4 hours. Average cost, 3d. per lb.

Sufficient for 8 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

FRIED OX-FEET, or COW-HEEL.

639. INGREDIENTS.--Ox-feet, the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs, parsley, salt and cayenne to taste,
boiling butter.

Mode.--Wash, scald, and thoroughly clean the feet, and cut them into pieces about 2 inches
long; have ready some fine bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley, cayenne, and salt;
dip the pieces of heel into the yolk of egg, sprinkle them with the bread crumbs, and fry them
until of a nice brown in boiling butter.

Time.-1 hour. Average cost, 6d. each.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Ox-feet may be dressed in various ways, stowed in gravy or plainly boiled and served
with melted butter. When plainly boiled, the liquor will answer for making sweet or relishing
jellies, and also to give richness to soups or gravies.

STEWED OX-TAILS.

640. INGREDIENTS.--2 ox-tails, 1 onion, 3 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 1 teaspoonful of whole black
pepper, 1 teaspoonful of allspice, 1/2 a teaspoonful of salt, a small bunch of savoury herbs,
thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom
ketchup.

Mode.--Divide the tails at the joints, wash, and put them into a stewpan with sufficient water
to cover them, and set them on the fire; when the water boils, remove the scum, and add the
onion cut into rings, the spice, seasoning, and herbs. Cover the stewpan closely, and let the
tails simmer very gently until tender, which will be in about 2-1/2 hours. Take them out, make
a thickening of butter and flour, add it to the gravy, and let it boil for 1/4 hour. Strain
it through a sieve into a saucepan, put back the tails, add the lemon-juice and ketchup; let
the whole just boil up, and serve. Garnish with croûtons or sippets of toasted bread.

Time.--2-1/2 hours to stew the tails.

Average cost, 9d. to 1s. 6d., according to the season.

Sufficient for 8 persons.

Seasonable all the year.

    THE TAILS OF ANIMALS.--In the class Mammalia, the vertebral
    column or backbone presents only slight modifications, and
    everywhere shows the same characteristics as in man, who stands
    at the head of this division of the animal kingdom. The length
    of this column, however, varies much, and the number of
    vertebrae of which it is composed is far from being uniform.
    These numerical differences principally depend on the unequal
    development of the caudal portion, or tail-end, of the column.
    Thus, the tail-forming vertebrae sometimes do not exist at
    all,--amongst certain bats for example; in other instances we
    reckon forty, fifty, and even upwards of sixty of these bones.
    Among the greater number of mammals, the tail is of little use
    for locomotion, except that it acts in many cases as does the
    rudder of a ship, steadying the animal in his rapid movements,
    and enabling him to turn more easily and quickly. Among some
    animals, it becomes a very powerful instrument of progression.
    Thus, in the kangaroos and jerboas, the tail forms, with the
    hind feet, a kind of tripod from which the animal makes its
    spring. With most of the American monkeys it is prehensile, and
    serves the animal as a fifth hand to suspend itself from the
    branches of trees; and, lastly, among the whales, it grows to an
    enormous size, and becomes the principal instrument for
    swimming.

A PICKLE FOR TONGUES OR BEEF (Newmarket Recipe).

641. INGREDIENTS.--1 gallon of soft water, 3 lbs. of coarse salt, 6 oz. of coarse brown sugar,
1/2 oz. of saltpetre.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, and let them boil for 1/2 hour, clear off the
scum as it rises, and when done pour the pickle into a pickling-pan. Let it get cold, then
put in the meat, and allow it to remain in the pickle from 8 to 14 days, according to the size.
It will keep good for 6 months if well boiled once a fortnight. Tongues will take 1 month or
6 weeks to be properly cured; and, in salting meat, beef and tongues should always be put in
separate vessels.

Time.--A moderate-sized tongue should remain in the pickle about a month, and be turned every day.

POTTED BEEF.

I.

642. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of lean beef, 1 tablespoonful of water, 1/4 lb. of butter, a seasoning
to taste of salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and black pepper.

Mode.--Procure a nice piece of lean beef, as free as possible from gristle, skin, &c., and
put it into a jar (if at hand, one with a lid) with 1 tablespoonful of water. Cover it closely,
and put the jar into a saucepan of boiling water, letting the water come within 2 inches of
the top of the jar. Boil gently for 3-1/2 hours, then take the beef, chop it very small with
a chopping-knife, and pound it thoroughly in a mortar. Mix with it by degrees all, or a portion,
of the gravy that will have run from it, and a little clarified butter; add the seasoning,
put it in small pots for use, and cover with a little butter just warmed and poured over. If
much gravy is added to it, it will keep but a short time; on the contrary, if a large proportion
of butter is used, it may be preserved for some time.

Time.--3-1/2 hours. Average cost, for this quantity, 1s. 8d.

Seasonable at any time.

POTTED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).

II.

643. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled beef, 1/4 lb. of butter, cayenne to
taste, 2 blades of pounded mace.

Mode.--As we have stated in recipe No. 608, the outside slices of boiled beef may, with a little
trouble, be converted into a very nice addition to the breakfast-table. Cut up the meat into
small pieces and pound it well, with a little butter, in a mortar; add a seasoning of cayenne
and mace, and be very particular that the latter ingredient is reduced to the finest powder.
When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, put it into glass or earthen potting-pots, and
pour on the top a coating of clarified butter.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--If cold roast beef is used, remove all pieces of gristle and dry outside pieces, as
these do not pound well.

    PRESERVED MEATS.--When an organic substance, like the flesh of
    animals, is heated to the boiling-point, it loses the property
    of passing into a state of fermentation and decay. Fresh animal
    milk, as is well known, coagulates, after having been kept for
    two or three days, into a gelatinous mass; but it may be
    preserved for an indefinite period, as a perfectly sweet liquid,
    if it be heated daily to the boiling-point. The knowledge of
    this effect of an elevated temperature has given rise to a most
    important branch of industry,--namely, the preparation of
    preserved meats for the use of the navy and merchant service. At
    Leith, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, at Aberdeen, at
    Bordeaux, at Marseilles, and in many parts of Germany,
    establishments of enormous magnitude exist, in which soup,
    vegetables, and viands of every description are prepared, in
    such a manner that they retain their freshness for years. The
    prepared aliments are inclosed in canisters of tinned iron
    plate, the covers are soldered air-tight, and the canisters
    exposed to the temperature of boiling water for three or four
    hours. The aliments thus acquire a stability, which one may
    almost say is eternal; and when a canister is opened, after the
    lapse of several years, its contents are found to be unaltered
    in taste, colour, and smell. We are indebted to the French
    philosopher Gay-Lussac for this beautiful practical application
    of the discovery that boiling checks fermentation. An exclusive
    salt-meat diet is extremely injurious to the health; and, in
    former times, thousands of mariners lost their lives for the
    want of fresh aliments during long voyages. We are sorry to say
    that the preserved meats are sometimes carelessly prepared, and,
    though the statement seems incredible, sometimes adulterated.
    Dr. Lankester, who has done so much to expose the frauds of
    trade, that he ought to be regarded as a public benefactor, says
    that he has seen things which were utterly unfit for food,
    shipped as preserved meats. Surely, as he observes, there ought
    to be some superintendent to examine the so-called articles of
    food that are taken on board ship, so that the poor men who have
    been fighting our battles abroad may run no risk of being
    starved or poisoned on their way home.

RIB OF BEEF BONES.

(A Pretty Dish.)

644. INGREDIENTS.--Rib of beef bones, 1 onion chopped fine, a few slices of carrot and turnip,
1/4 pint of gravy.

Mode.--The bones for this dish should have left on them a slight covering of meat; saw them
into pieces 3 inches long; season them with pepper and salt, and put them into a stewpan with
the remaining ingredients. Stew gently, until the vegetables are tender, and serve on a flat
dish within walls of mashed potatoes.

Time.--3/4 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the bones, 2d.

Seasonable at any time.

BEEF RISSOLES (Cold Meat Cookery).

645. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef; to each pound of meat allow 3/4 lb. of bread
crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, a few chopped savoury herbs, 1/2 a teaspoonful of minced
lemon-peel, 1 or 2 eggs, according to the quantity of meat.

Mode.--Mince the beef very fine, which should be rather lean, and mix with this bread crumbs,
herbs, seasoning, and lemon-peel, in the above proportion, to each pound of meat. Make all
into a thick paste with 1 or 2 eggs; divide into balls or cones, and fry a rich brown. Garnish
the dish with fried parsley, and send with them to table some good brown gravy in a tureen.
Instead of garnishing with fried parsley, gravy may be poured in the dish, round the rissoles:
in this case, it will not be necessary to send any in a tureen.

Time.--From 5 to 10 minutes, according to size.

Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 5d.

Seasonable at any time.

ROLLED BEEF, to eat like Hare.

646. INGREDIENTS.--About 5 lbs. of the inside of the sirloin, 2 glasses of port wine, 2 glasses
of vinegar, a small quantity of forcemeat (No. 417), 1 teaspoonful of pounded allspice.

Mode.--Take the inside of a large sirloin, soak it in 1 glass of port wine and 1 glass of vinegar,
mixed, and let it remain for 2 days. Make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417, lay it on the meat,
and bind it up securely. Roast it before a nice clear fire, and baste it with 1 glass each
of port wine and vinegar, with which mix a teaspoonful of pounded allspice. Serve, with a good
gravy in the dish, and send red-currant jelly to table with it.

Time.--A piece of 5 lbs. about 1-1/2 hour before a brisk fire.

Average cost, for this quantity, 5s. 4d.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

BEEF ROLLS (Cold Meat Cookery).

647. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled beef, seasoning to taste of salt, pepper,
and minced herbs; puff paste.

Mode.--Mince the beef tolerably fine with a small amount of its own fat; add a seasoning of
pepper, salt, and chopped herbs; put the whole into a roll of puff paste, and bake for 1/2
hour, or rather longer, should the roll be very large. Beef patties may be made of cold meat,
by mincing and seasoning beef as directed above, and baking in a rich puff paste in patty-tins.

Time,--1/2 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

MINIATURE ROUND OF BEEF. (An Excellent Dish for a Small Family.)

648. INGREDIENTS.--From 5 to 10 lbs. of rib of beef, sufficient brine to cover the meat.

Mode.--Choose a fine rib, have the bone removed, rub some salt over the inside, and skewer
the meat up into a nice round form, and bind it with tape. Put it into sufficient brine to
cover it (the brine should be made by recipe No. 654), and let it remain for 6 days, turning
the meat every day. When required to be dressed, drain from the pickle, and put the meat into
very hot water; let it boil rapidly for a few minutes, when draw the pot to the side of the
fire, and let it simmer very gently until done. Remove the skewer, and replace it by a plated
or silver one. Carrots and turnips should be served with this dish, and may be boiled with
the meat.

Time.--A small round of 8 lbs., about 2 hours after the water boils; one of 12 lbs., about 3 hours.

Average cost, 9d. per lb.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Should the joint be very small, 4 or 5 days will be sufficient time to salt it.

BRISKET OF BEEF, a la Flamande.

649. INGREDIENTS.--About 6 or 8 lbs. of the brisket of beef, 4 or 5 slices of bacon, 2 carrots,
1 onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, 4 cloves, 4 whole allspice, 2
blades of mace.

Mode.--Choose that portion of the brisket which contains the gristle, trim it, and put it into
a stewpan with the slices of bacon, which should be put under and over the meat. Add the vegetables,
herbs, spices, and seasoning, and cover with a little weak stock or water; close the stewpan
as hermetically as possible, and simmer very gently for 4 hours. Strain the liquor, reserve
a portion of it for sauce, and the remainder boil quickly over a sharp fire until reduced to
a glaze, with which glaze the meat. Garnish the dish with scooped carrots and turnips, and
when liked, a little cabbage; all of which must be cooked separately. Thicken and flavour the
liquor that was saved for sauce, pour it round the meat, and serve. The beef may also be garnished
with glazed onions, artichoke-bottoms, &c.

Time.--4 hours. Average cost, 7d. per lb.

Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    FRENCH BEEF.--It has been all but universally admitted, that the
    beef of France is greatly inferior in quality to that of
    England, owing to inferiority of pasturage. M. Curmer, however,
    one of the latest writers on the culinary art, tells us that
    this is a vulgar error, and that French beef is far superior to
    that of England. This is mere vaunting on the part of our
    neighbours, who seem to want la gloire in everything; and we
    should not deign to notice it, if it had occurred in a work of
    small pretensions; but M. Curmer's book professes to be a
    complete exposition of the scientific principles of cookery, and
    holds a high rank in the didactic literature of France. We half
    suspect that M. Curmer obtained his knowledge of English beef in
    the same way as did the poor Frenchman, whom the late Mr.
    Mathews, the comedian, so humorously described. Mr. Lewis, in
    his "Physiology of Common Life," has thus revived the story of
    the beef-eating son of France:--"A Frenchman was one day blandly
    remonstrating against the supercilious scorn expressed by
    Englishmen for the beef of France, which he, for his part, did
    not find so inferior to that of England. 'I have been two times
    in England,' he remarked, but I nevère find the bif so supérieur
    to ours. I find it vary conveenient that they bring it you on
    leetle pieces of stick, for one penny: but I do not find the bif
    supérieur.' On hearing this, the Englishman, red with
    astonishment, exclaimed, 'Good heavens, sir! you have been
    eating cat's meat.'" No, M. Curmer, we are ready to acknowledge
    the superiority of your cookery, but we have long since made up
    our minds as to the inferiority of your raw material.

BEEF OLIVES.

I.

650. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, 1 egg, 1 tablespoonful of minced savoury herbs, pepper
and salt to taste, 1 pint of stock, No. 105, 2 or 3 slices of bacon, 2 tablespoonfuls of any
store sauce, a slight thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Have the steaks cut rather thin, slightly beat them to make them level, cut them into
6 or 7 pieces, brush over with egg, and sprinkle with herbs, which should be very finely minced;
season with pepper and salt, and roll up the pieces tightly, and fasten with a small skewer.
Put the stock in a stewpan that will exactly hold them, for by being pressed together, they
will keep their shape better; lay in the rolls of meat, cover them with the bacon, cut in thin
slices, and over that put a piece of paper. Stew them very gently for full 2 hours; for the
slower they are done the better. Take them out, remove the skewers, thicken the gravy with
butter and flour, and flavour with any store sauce that may be preferred. Give one boil, pour
over the meat, and serve.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, 1s. per pound.

Sufficient for 4 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

II.

(Economical.)

651. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of underdone cold roast beef, bread crumbs, 1 shalot finely
minced, pepper and salt to taste, gravy made from the beef bones, thickening of butter and
flour, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.

Mode.--Cut some slices of underdone roast beef about half an inch thick; sprinkle over them
some bread crumbs, minced shalot, and a little of the fat and seasoning; roll them, and fasten
with a small skewer. Have ready some gravy made from the beef bones; put in the pieces of meat,
and stew them till tender, which will be in about 1-1/4 hour, or rather longer.

Seasonable at any time.

BROILED OX-TAIL (an Entree).

652. INGREDIENTS.--2 tails, 1-1/2 pint of stock, No. 105, salt and cayenne to taste, bread
crumbs, 1 egg.

Mode.--Joint and cut up the tails into convenient-sized pieces, and put them into a stewpan,
with the stock, cayenne, and salt, and, if liked very savoury, a bunch of sweet herbs. Let
them simmer gently for about 2-1/2 hours; then take them out, drain them, and let them cool.
Beat an egg upon a plate; dip in each piece of tail, and, afterwards, throw them into a dish
of bread crumbs; broil them over a clear fire, until of a brownish colour on both sides, and
serve with a good gravy, or any sauce that may be preferred.

Time.--About 2-1/2 hours. Average cost, from 9d. to 1s. 6d., according to the season.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--These may be more easily prepared by putting the tails in a brisk oven, after they have
been dipped in egg and bread-crumb; and, when brown, they are done. They must be boiled the
same time as for broiling.

    STRANGE TAILS.--Naturalists cannot explain the uses of some of
    the strange tails borne by animals. In the Egyptian and Syrian
    sheep, for instance, the tail grows so large, that it is not
    infrequently supported upon a sort of little cart, in order to
    prevent inconvenience to the animal. Thin monstrous appendage
    sometimes attains a weight of seventy, eighty, or even a hundred
    pounds.

TO DRESS BEEF PALATES (an Entree).

653. INGREDIENTS.--4 palates, sufficient gravy to cover them (No. 438), cayenne to taste, 1
tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of pickled-onion liquor, thickening of butter
and flour.

Mode.--Wash the palates, and put them into a stewpan, with sufficient water to cover them,
and let them boil until perfectly tender, or until the upper skin may be easily peeled off.
Have ready sufficient gravy (No. 438) to cover them; add a good seasoning of cayenne, and thicken
with roux, No. 625, or a little butter kneaded with flour; let it boil up, and skim. Cut the
palates into square pieces, put them in the gravy, and let them simmer gently for 1/2 hour;
add ketchup and onion-liquor, give one boil, and serve.

Time.--From 3 to 5 hours to boil the palates.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Palates may be dressed in various ways with sauce tournée, good onion sauce, tomato
sauce, and also served in a vol-au-vent; but the above will be found a more simple method of
dressing them.

BEEF PICKLE, which may also be used for any kind of Meat, Tongues, or Hams.

654. INGREDIENTS.--6 lbs. of salt, 2 lbs. of fine sugar, 3 oz. of powdered saltpetre, 3 gallons
of spring water.

Mode.--Boil all the ingredients gently together, so long as any scum or impurity arises, which
carefully remove; when quite cold, pour it over the meat, every part of which must be covered
with the brine. This may be used for pickling any kind of meat, and may be kept for some time,
if boiled up occasionally with an addition of the ingredients.

Time.--A ham should be kept in the pickle for a fortnight; a piece of beef weighing 14 lbs.,
12 or 15 days; a tongue, 10 days or a fortnight.

Note.--For salting and pickling meat, it is a good plan to rub in only half the quantity of
salt directed, and to let it remain for a day or two to disgorge and effectually to get rid
of the blood and slime; then rub in the remainder of the salt and other ingredients, and proceed
as above. This rule may be applied to all the recipes we have given for salting and pickling meat.

TO PICKLE PART OF A ROUND OF BEEF FOR HANGING.

655. INGREDIENTS.--For 14 lbs. of a round of beef allow 1-1/2 lb. of salt, 1/2 oz. of powdered
saltpetre; or, 1 lb. of salt, 1/2 lb. of sugar, 4 oz. of powdered saltpetre.

Mode.--Rub in, and sprinkle either of the above mixtures on 14 lbs. of meat. Keep it in an
earthenware pan, or a deep wooden tray, and turn twice a week during 3 weeks; then bind up
the beef tightly with coarse linen tape, and hang it in a kitchen in which a fire is constantly
kept, for 3 weeks. Pork, hams, and bacon may be cured in a similar way, but will require double
the quantity of the salting mixture; and, if not smoke-dried, they should be taken down from
hanging after 3 or 4 weeks, and afterwards kept in boxes or tubs, amongst dry oat-husks.

Time.--2 or 3 weeks to remain in the brine; to be hung 3 weeks.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The meat may be boiled fresh from this pickle, instead of smoking it.

BEEP RAGOUT (Cold Meat Cookery).

656. INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs. of cold roast beef, 6 onions, pepper, salt, and mixed spices
to taste; 1/2 pint of boiling water, 3 tablespoonfuls of gravy.

Mode.--Cut the beef into rather large pieces, and put them into a stewpan with the onions,
which must be sliced. Season well with pepper, salt, and mixed spices, and pour over about
1/2 pint of boiling water, and gravy in the above proportion (gravy saved from the meat answers
the purpose); let the whole stew very gently for about 2 hours, and serve with pickled walnuts,
gherkins, or capers, just warmed in the gravy.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 4d.

Seasonable at any time.

ROAST RIBS OF BEEF.

657. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, a little salt.

Mode.---The fore-rib is considered the primest roasting piece, but the middle-rib is considered
the most economical. Let the meat be well hung (should the weather permit), and cut off the
thin ends of the bones, which should be salted for a few days, and then boiled. Put the meat
down to a nice clear fire, put some clean dripping into the pan, dredge the joint with a little
flour, and keep continually basting the whole time. Sprinkle some fine salt over it (this must
never be done until the joint is dished, as it draws the juices from the meat); pour the dripping
from the pan, put in a little boiling: water slightly salted, and strain the gravy over the
meat. Garnish with tufts of scraped horseradish, and send horseradish sauce to table with it
(see No. 447). A Yorkshire pudding (see Puddings) sometimes accompanies this dish, and, if
lightly made and well cooked, will be found a very agreeable addition.

Time.--10 lbs. of beef, 2-1/2 hours; 14 to 16 lbs., from 3-1/2 to 4 hours.

Average cost, 8-1/2d. per lb.

Sufficient.--A joint of 10 lbs. sufficient for 8 or 9 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    MEMORANDA IN ROASTING.--The management of the fire is a point of
    primary importance in roasting. A radiant fire throughout the
    operation is absolutely necessary to insure a good result. When
    the article to be dressed is thin and delicate, the fire may be
    small; but when the joint is large, the fire must fill the
    grate. Meat must never be put down before a hollow or exhausted
    fire, which may soon want recruiting; on the other hand, if the
    heat of the fire becomes too fierce, the meat must be removed to
    a considerable distance till it is somewhat abated. Some cooks
    always fail in their roasts, though they succeed in nearly
    everything else. A French writer on the culinary art says that
    anybody can learn how to cook, but one must be born a roaster.
    According to Liebig, beef or mutton cannot be said to be
    sufficiently roasted until it has acquired, throughout the whole
    mass, a temperature of 158°; but poultry may be well cooked when
    the inner parts hare attained a temperature of from 130° to
    140°. This depends on the greater amount of blood which beef and
    mutton contain, the colouring matter of blood not being
    coagulable under 158°.

ROAST RIBS OF BEEF, Boned and Rolled (a very Convenient Joint for a Small Family).

658. INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 ribs of beef.

Mode.--Choose a fine rib of beef, and have it cut according to the weight you require, either
wide or narrow. Bone and roll the meat round, secure it with wooden skewers, and, if necessary,
bind it round with a piece of tape. Spit the beef firmly, or, if a bottle-jack is used, put
the joint on the hook, and place it near a nice clear fire. Let it remain so till the outside
of the meat is set, when draw it to a distance, and keep continually basting until the meat
is done, which can be ascertained by the steam from it drawing towards the fire. As this joint
is solid, rather more than 1/4 hour must be allowed for each lb. Remove the skewers, put in
a plated or silver one, and send the joint to table with gravy in the dish, and garnish with
tufts of horseradish. Horseradish sauce, No. 447, is a great improvement to roast beef.

Time.--For 10 lbs. of the rolled ribs, 3 hours (as the joint is very solid, we have allowed
an extra 1/2 hour); for 6 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable all the year.

Note.--When the weight exceeds 10 lbs., we would not advise the above method of boning and
rolling; only in the case of 1 or 2 ribs, when the joint cannot stand upright in the dish,
and would look awkward. The bones should be put in with a few vegetables and herbs, and made
into stock.

    ROAST BEEF has long been a national dish in England. In most of
    our patriotic songs it is contrasted with the fricasseed frogs,
    popularly supposed to be the exclusive diet of Frenchmen.

      "O the roast beef of old England,
      And O the old English roast beef."

    This national chorus is appealed to whenever a song-writer
    wishes to account for the valour displayed by Englishmen at sea
    or on land.

ROAST SIRLOIN OF BEEF.

659. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, a little salt.

Mode.--As a joint cannot be well roasted without a good fire, see that it is well made up about
3/4 hour before it is required, so that when the joint is put down, it is clear and bright.
Choose a nice sirloin, the weight of which should not exceed 16 lbs., as the outside would
be too much done, whilst the inside would not be done enough. Spit it or hook it on to the
jack firmly, dredge it slightly with flour, and place it near the fire at first, as directed
in the preceding recipe. Then draw it to a distance, and keep continually basting until the
meat is done. Sprinkle a small quantity of salt over it, empty the dripping-pan of all the
dripping, pour in some boiling water slightly salted, stir it about, and strain over the meat.
Garnish with tufts of horseradish, and send horseradish sauce and Yorkshire pudding to table
with it. For carving, see p. 317.

Seasonable at any time.

The rump, round, and other pieces of beef are roasted in the same manner, allowing for solid
joints; 1/4 hour to every lb.

Note.---The above is the usual method of roasting moat; but to have it in perfection and the
juices kept in, the meat should at first be laid close to the fire, and when the outside is
set and firm, drawn away to a good distance, and then left to roast very slowly; where economy
is studied, this plan would not answer, as the meat requires to be at the fire double the time
of the ordinary way of cooking; consequently, double the quantity of fuel would be consumed.

    ORIGIN OF THE WORD "SIRLOIN."--The loin of beef is said to have
    been knighted by King Charles II., at Friday Hall, Chingford.
    The "Merry Monarch" returned to this hospitable mansion for
    Epping Forest literally "as hungry as a hunter," and beheld,
    with delight, a huge loin of beef steaming upon the table. "A
    noble joint!" exclaimed the king. "By St. George, it shall have
    a title!" Then drawing his sword, he raised it above the meat,
    and cried, with mock dignity, "Loin, we dub thee knight;
    henceforward be Sir Loin!" This anecdote is doubtless
    apocryphal, although the oak table upon which the joint was
    supposed to hare received its knighthood, might have been seen
    by any one who visited Friday-Hill House, a few years ago. It
    is, perhaps, a pity to spoil so noble a story; but the interests
    of truth demand that we declare that sirloin is probably a
    corruption of surloin, which signifies the upper part of a
    loin, the prefix sur being equivalent to over or above. In
    French we find this joint called surlonge, which so closely
    resembles our sirloin, that we may safely refer the two words
    to a common origin.

TO SALT BEEF.

660. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 round of beef, 4 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of powdered saltpetre, 2 oz. of
black pepper, 1/4 lb. of bay-salt, 1/2 lb. of common salt. Mode.--Rub the meat well with salt,
and let it remain for a day, to disgorge and clear it from slime. The next day, rub it well
with the above ingredients on every side, and let it remain in the pickle for about a fortnight,
turning it every day. It may be boiled fresh from the pickle, or smoked.

Time.--1/2 round of beef to remain in pickle about a fortnight. Average cost, 7d. per lb. Seasonable
at any time.

Note.--The aitch-bone, flank, or brisket may be salted and pickled by any of the recipes we
have given for salting beef, allowing less time for small joints to remain in the pickle; for
instance, a joint of 8 or 9 lbs. will be sufficiently salt in about a week.

THE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF.

661. INGREDIENTS.--10 lbs. of lean beef, 1 lb. of treacle, 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common
salt.

Mode.--Rub the beef well with the treacle, and let it remain for 3 days, turning and rubbing
it often; then wipe it, pound the salt and saltpetre very fine, rub these well in, and turn
it every day for 10 days. Roll it up tightly in a coarse cloth, and press it under a large
weight; have it smoked, and turn it upside down every day. Boil it, and, on taking it out of
the pot, put a heavy weight on it to press it.

Time.--17 days.

Seasonable at any time.

BEEF SAUSAGES.

662. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of suet allow 2 lbs. of lean beef; seasoning to taste of salt,
pepper, and mixed spices.

Mode.--Clear the suet from skin, and chop that and the beef as finely as possible; season with
pepper, salt, and spices, and mix the whole well together. Make it into flat cakes, and fry
of a nice brown. Many persons pound the meat in a mortar after it is chopped ( but this is
not necessary when the meat is minced finely.)

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, for this quantity, 1s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

BEEF-STEAK, Rolled, Roasted, and Stuffed.

663. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, forcemeat No. 417, pepper and salt to taste, clarified
butter.

Mode.--Have the steaks cut rather thick from a well-hung rump of beef, and sprinkle over them
a seasoning of pepper and salt. Make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417; spread it over half of
the steak; roll it up, bind and skewer it firmly, that the forcemeat may not escape, and roast
it before a nice clear fire for about 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer, should the roll be very
large and thick. Keep it constantly basted with butter, and serve with brown gravy, some of
which must be poured round the steak, and the remainder sent to table in a tureen.

SLICED AND BROILED BEEF--a Pretty Dish (Cold Meat Cookery).

664. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold roast beef, 4 or 5 potatoes, a thin batter, pepper
and salt to taste.

Mode.--Pare the potatoes as you would peel an apple; fry the parings in a thin batter seasoned
with salt and pepper, until they are of a light brown colour, and place them on a dish over
some slices of beef, which should be nicely seasoned and broiled.

Time.--5 minutes to broil the meat.

Seasonable at any time.

SPICED BEEF (to Serve Cold).

665. INGREDIENTS.--14 lbs. of the thick flank or rump of beef, 1/2 lb. of coarse sugar, 1 oz.
of saltpetre, 1/4 lb. of pounded allspice, 1 lb. of common salt.

Mode.--Rub the sugar well into the beef, and let it lay for 12 hours; then rub the saltpetre
and allspice, both of which should be pounded, over the meat, and let it remain for another
12 hours; then rub in the salt. Turn daily in the liquor for a fortnight, soak it for a few
hours in water, dry with a cloth, cover with a coarse paste, put a little water at the bottom
of the pan, and bake in a moderate oven for 4 hours. If it is not covered with a paste, be
careful to put the beef into a deep vessel, and cover with a plate, or it will be too crisp.
During the time the meat is in the oven it should be turned once or twice.

Time.--4 hours. Average cost, 7d. per lb.

Seasonable at any time.

    BAKING MEAT.--Baking exerts some unexplained influence on meat,
    rendering it less savoury and less agreeable than meat which has
    been roasted. "Those who have travelled in Germany and France,"
    writes Mr. Lewis, one of our most popular scientific authors,
    "must have repeatedly marvelled at the singular uniformity in
    the flavour, or want of flavour, of the various 'roasts' served
    up at the table-d'hôte." The general explanation is, that the
    German and French meat is greatly inferior in quality to that of
    England and Holland, owing to the inferiority of pasturage; and
    doubtless this is one cause, but it is not the chief cause. The
    meat is inferior, but the cooking is mainly at fault. The meat
    is scarcely ever roasted, because there is no coal, and
    firewood is expensive. The meat is therefore baked; and the
    consequence of this baking is, that no meat is eatable or eaten,
    with its own gravy, but is always accompanied by some sauce more
    or less piquant. The Germans generally believe that in England
    we eat our beef and mutton almost raw; they shudder at our
    gravy, as if it were so much blood.

STEWED BEEF or RUMP STEAK (an Entree).

666.

Mode.--Have the steaks cut tolerably thick and rather lean; divide them into convenient-sized
pieces, and fry them in the butter a nice brown on both sides. Cleanse and pare the vegetables,
cut the onions and carrots into thin slices, and the turnips into dice, and fry these in the
same fat that the steaks were done in. Put all into a saucepan, add 1/2 pint of water, or rather
more should it be necessary, and simmer very gently for 2-1/2 or 3 hours; when nearly done,
skim well, add salt, pepper, and ketchup in the above proportions, and thicken with a tablespoonful
of flour mixed with 2 of cold water. Let it boil up for a minute or two after the thickening
is added, and serve. When a vegetable-scoop is at hand, use it to cut the vegetables in fanciful
shapes, and tomato, Harvey's sauce, or walnut-liquor may be used to flavour the gravy. It is
less rich if stewed the previous day, so that the fat may be taken off when cold; when wanted
for table, it will merely require warming through.

Time.--3 hours.

STEWED BEEF AND CELERY SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery).

667. INGREDIENTS.--3 roots of celery, 1 pint of gravy, No. 436, 2 onions sliced, 2 lbs. of
cold roast or boiled beef.

Mode.--Cut the celery into 2-inch pieces, put them in a stew-pan, with the gravy and onions,
simmer gently until the celery is tender, when add the beef cut into rather thick pieces; stew
gently for 10 minutes, and serve with fried potatoes.

Time.--From 20 to 25 minutes to stew the celery.

Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 6d.

Seasonable from September to January.

STEWED BEEF WITH OYSTERS (Cold Meat Cookery).

668. INGREDIENTS.--A few thick steaks of cold ribs or sirloin of beef, 2 oz. of butter, 1 onion
sliced, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 glass of port wine, a little flour to thicken, 1 or 2
dozen oysters, rather more than 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Cut the steaks rather thick, from cold sirloin or ribs of beef; brown them lightly in
a stewpan, with the butter and a little water; add 1/2 pint of water, the onion, pepper, and
salt, and cover the stewpan closely, and let it simmer very gently for 1/2 hour; then mix about
a teaspoonful of flour smoothly with a little of the liquor; add the port wine and oysters,
their liquor having been previously strained and put into the stewpan; stir till the oysters
plump, and serve. It should not boil after the oysters are added, or they will harden. 4d.

Seasonable from September to April.

STEWED BRISKET OF BEEF.

669. INGREDIENTS.--7 lbs. of a brisket of beef, vinegar and salt, 6 carrots, 6 turnips, 6 small
onions, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 whole allspice pounded, thickening of butter and flour,
2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup; stock, or water.

Mode.--About an hour before dressing it, rub the meat over with vinegar and salt; put it into
a stewpan, with sufficient stock to cover it (when this is not at hand, water may be substituted
for it), and be particular that the stewpan is not much larger than the meat. Skim well, and
when it has simmered very gently for 1 hour, put in the vegetables, and continue simmering
till the meat is perfectly tender. Draw out the bones, dish the meat, and garnish either with
tufts of cauliflower or braised cabbage cut in quarters. Thicken as much gravy as required,
with a little butter and flour; add spices and ketchup in the above proportion, give one boil,
pour some of it over the meat, and the remainder send in a tureen.

Note.--The remainder of the liquor in which the beef was boiled may be served as a soup, or
it may be sent to table with the meat in a tureen.

STEWED RUMP OF BEEF.

670. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 rump of beef, sufficient stock to cover it (No. 105), 4 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 1 large bunch of savoury herbs, 2 onions, 12 cloves,
pepper and salt to taste, thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of port wine.

Mode.--Cut out the bone, sprinkle the meat with a little cayenne (this must be sparingly used),
and bind and tie it firmly up with tape; put it into a stewpan with sufficient stock to cover
it, and add vinegar, ketchup, herbs, onions, cloves, and seasoning in the above proportion,
and simmer very gently for 4 or 5 hours, or until the meat is perfectly tender, which may be
ascertained by piercing it with a thin skewer. When done, remove the tape, lay it into a deep
dish, which keep hot; strain and skim the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, add a glass
of port wine and any flavouring to make the gravy rich and palatable; let it boil up, pour
over the meat, and serve. This dish may be very much enriched by garnishing with forcemeat
balls, or filling up the space whence the bone is taken with a good forcemeat; sliced carrots,
turnips, and onions boiled with the meat, are also a great improvement, and, where expense
is not objected to, it may be glazed. This, however, is not necessary where a good gravy is
poured round and over the meat.

Time.--1/2 rump stewed gently from 4 to 5 hours.

Average cost, 10d. per lb. Sufficient for 8 or 10 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--A stock or gravy in which to boil the meat, may be made of the bone and trimmings, by
boiling them with water, and adding carrots, onions, turnips, and a bunch of sweet herbs. To
make this dish richer and more savoury, half-roast the rump, and afterwards stew it in strong
stock and a little Madeira. This is an expensive method, and is not, after all, much better
than a plainer-dressed joint.

    THE BARON OF BEEF.--This noble joint, which consisted of two
    sirloins not cut asunder, was a favourite dish of our ancestors.
    It is rarely seen nowadays; indeed, it seems out of place on a
    modern table, as it requires the grim boar's head and Christmas
    pie as supporters. Sir Walter Scott has described a feast at
    which the baron of beef would have appeared to great advantage.
    We will quote a few lines to remind us of those days when
    "England was merry England," and when hospitality was thought to
    be the highest virtue.
      Well can the green-garb'd ranger tell
      How, when, and where the monster fell;
      What dogs before his death he tore,
      And all the baiting of the boar;
      While round the merry wassel bowl,
      Garnish'd with ribbons, blithe did trowl.

    When a lord's son came of age, in the olden time, the baron of
    beef was too small a joint, by many degrees, to satisfy the
    retainers who would flock to the hall; a whole ox was therefore
    generally roasted over a fire built up of huge logs. We may here
    mention, that an ox was roasted entire on the frozen Thames, in
    the early part of the present century.

STEWED SHIN OF BEEF.

671. INGREDIENTS.--A shin of beef, 1 head of celery, 1 onion, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2
teaspoonful of allspice, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole black pepper, 4 carrots, 12 button onions,
2 turnips, thickening of butter and flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls
of port wine; pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Have the bone sawn into 4 or 5 pieces, cover with hot water, bring it to a boil, and
remove any scum that may rise to the surface. Put in the celery, onion, herbs, spice, and seasoning,
and simmer very gently until the meat is tender. Peel the vegetables, cut them into any shape
fancy may dictate, and boil them with the onions until tender; lift out the beef, put it on
a dish, which keep hot, and thicken with butter and flour as much of the liquor as will be
wanted for gravy; keep stirring till it boils, then strain and skim. Put the gravy back in
the stewpan, add the seasoning, port wine, and ketchup, give one boil, and pour it over the
beef; garnish with the boiled carrots, turnips, and onions.

Time.--The meat to be stewed about 4 hours. Average cost, 4d. per lb. with bone.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

TOAD-IN-THE-HOLE (a Homely but Savoury Dish).

672. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rump-steak, 1 sheep's kidney, pepper and salt to taste. For
the batter, 3 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Cut up the steak and kidney into convenient-sized pieces, and put them into a pie-dish,
with a good seasoning of salt and pepper; mix the flour with a small quantity of milk at first,
to prevent its being lumpy; add the remainder, and the 3 eggs, which should be well beaten;
put in the salt, stir the batter for about 5 minutes, and pour it over the steak. Place it
in a tolerably brisk oven immediately, and bake for 1-1/2 hour. 9d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The remains of cold beef, rather underdone, may be substituted for the steak, and, when
liked, the smallest possible quantity of minced onion or shalot may be added.

BOILED TONGUE.

673. INGREDIENTS.--1 tongue, a bunch of savoury herbs, water.

Mode.--In choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it has been dried or pickled, and select one
with a smooth skin, which denotes its being young and tender. If a dried one, and rather hard,
soak it at least for 12 hours previous to cooking it; if, however, it is fresh from the pickle,
2 or 3 hours will be sufficient for it to remain in sock. Put the tongue in a stewpan with
plenty of cold water and a bunch of savoury herbs; let it gradually come to a boil, skim well
and simmer very gently until tender. Peel off the skin, garnish with tufts of cauliflowers
or Brussels sprouts, and serve. Boiled tongue is frequently sent to table with boiled poultry,
instead of ham, and is, by many persons, preferred. If to serve cold, peel it, fasten it down
to a piece of board by sticking a fork through the root, and another through the top, to straighten
it. When cold, glaze it, and put a paper ruche round the root, and garnish with tufts of parsley.

Time.--A large smoked tongue, 4 to 4-1/2 hours; a small one, 2-1/2 to 3 hours. A large unsmoked
tongue, 3 to 3-1/2 hours; a small one, 2 to 2-1/2 hours.

Average cost, for a moderate sized tongue, 3s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

TO CURE TONGUES.

I.

674. INGREDIENTS.--For a tongue of 7 lbs., 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1/2 oz. of black pepper, 4 oz.
of sugar, 3 oz. of juniper berries, 6 oz. of salt.

Mode.--Rub the above ingredients well into the tongue, and let it remain in the pickle for
10 days or a fortnight; then drain it, tie it up in brown paper, and have it smoked for about
20 days over a wood fire; or it may be boiled out of this pickle.

Time.--From 10 to 14 days to remain in the pickle; to be smoked 24 days.

Average cost, for a medium-sized uncured tongue, 2s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--If not wanted immediately, the tongue will keep 3 or 4 weeks without being too salt;
then it must not be rubbed, but only turned in the pickle.

II.

675. INGREDIENTS.--9 lbs. of salt, 8 oz. of sugar, 9 oz. of powdered saltpetre.

Mode.--Rub the above ingredients well into the tongues, and keep them in this curing mixture
for 2 months, turning them every day. Drain them from the pickle, cover with brown paper, and
have them smoked for about 3 weeks.

Time.--The tongues to remain in pickle 2 months; to be smoked 3 weeks.

Sufficient.--The above quantity of brine sufficient for 12 tongues, of 5 lbs. each.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE TONGUES OF ANIMALS.--The tongue, whether in the ox or in
    man, is the seat of the sense of taste. This sense warns the
    animal against swallowing deleterious substances. Dr. Carpenter
    says, that, among the lower animals, the instinctive perceptions
    connected with this sense, are much more remarkable than our
    own; thus, an omnivorous monkey will seldom touch fruits of a
    poisonous character, although their taste may be agreeable.
    However this may be, man's instinct has decided that ox-tongue
    is better than horse-tongue; nevertheless, the latter is
    frequently substituted by dishonest dealers for the former. The
    horse's tongue may be readily distinguished by a spoon-like
    expansion at its end.

TO PICKLE AND DRESS A TONGUE TO EAT COLD.

676. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of salt, 2 oz. of bay-salt, 1 oz. of saltpetre, 3 oz. of coarse sugar;
cloves, mace, and allspice to taste; butter, common crust of flour and water.

Mode.--Lay the tongue for a fortnight in the above pickle, turn it every day, and be particular
that the spices are well pounded; put it into a small pan just large enough to hold it, place
some pieces of butter on it, and cover with a common crust. Bake in a slow oven until so tender
that a straw would penetrate it; take off the skin, fasten it down to a piece of board by running
a fork through the root and another through the tip, at the same time straightening it and
putting it into shape. When cold, glaze it, put a paper ruche round the root, which is generally
very unsightly, and garnish with tufts of parsley.

Time.--From 3 or 4 hours in a slow oven, according to size.

TO DRESS TRIPE.

677. INGREDIENTS.--Tripe, onion sauce, No. 484, milk and water.

Mode.--Ascertain that the tripe is quite fresh, and have it cleaned and dressed. Cut away the
coarsest fat, and boil it in equal proportions of milk and water for 3/4 hour. Should the tripe
be entirely undressed, more than double that time should be allowed for it. Have ready some
onion sauce made by recipe No. 4S4, dish the tripe, smother it with the sauce, and the remainder
send to table in a tureen.

Time.--1 hour: for undressed tripe, from 2-1/2 to 3 hours.

Average cost, 7d. per lb.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Tripe may be dressed in a variety of ways: it may be cut in pieces and fried in batter,
stewed in gravy with mushrooms, or cut into collops, sprinkled with minced onion and savoury
herbs, and fried a nice brown in clarified butter.

BEEF CARVING.

AITCHBONE OF BEEF.

A boiled aitch-bone of beef is not a difficult joint to carve, as will be seen on reference
to the accompanying engraving. By following with the knife the direction of the line from 1
to 2, nice slices will be easily cut. It may be necessary, as in a round of beef, to cut a
thick slice off the outside before commencing to serve.

BRISKET OF BEEF.

There is but little description necessary to add, to show the carving of a boiled brisket of
beef, beyond the engraving here inserted. The only point to be observed is, that the joint
should be cut evenly and firmly quite across the bones, so that, on its reappearance at table,
it should not have a jagged and untidy look.

RIBS OF BEEF.

This dish resembles the sirloin, except that it has no fillet or undercut. As explained in
the recipes, the end piece is often cut off, salted and boiled. The mode of carving is similar
to that of the sirloin, viz., in the direction of the dotted line from 1 to 2. This joint will
be the more easily cut if the plan be pursued which is suggested in carving the sirloin; namely,
the inserting of the knife immediately between the bone and the moat, before commencing to
cut it into slices. All joints of roast beef should be cut in even and thin slices. Horseradish,
finely scraped, may be served as a garnish; but horseradish sauce is preferable for eating
with the beef.

SIRLOIN OF BEEF.

This dish is served differently at various tables, some preferring it to come to table with
the fillet, or, as it is usually called, the undercut, uppermost. The reverse way, as shown
in the cut, is that most usually adopted. Still the undercut is best eaten when hot; consequently,
the carver himself may raise the joint, and cut some slices from the under side, in the direction
of from 1 to 2, as the fillet is very much preferred by some eaters. The upper part of the
sirloin should be cut in the direction of the line from 5 to 6, and care should be taken to
carve it evenly and in thin slices. It will be found a great assistance, in carving this joint
well, if the knife be first inserted just above the bone at the bottom, and run sharply along
between the bone and meat, and also to divide the meat from the bone in the same way at the
side of the joint. The slices will then come away more readily.

Some carvers cut the upper side of the sirloin across, as shown by the line from 3 to 4; but
this is a wasteful plan, and one not to be recommended. With the sirloin, very finely-scraped
horseradish is usually served, and a little given, when liked, to each guest. Horseradish sauce
is preferable, however, for serving on the plate, although the scraped horseradish may still
be used as a garnish.

A ROUND OF BEEF.

A round of beef is not so easily carved as many other joints of beef, and to manage it properly,
a thin-bladed and very sharp knife is necessary. Off the outside of the joint, at its top,
a thick slice should first be cut, so as to leave the surface smooth; then thin and even slices
should be cleverly carved in the direction of the line 1 to 2; and with each slice of the lean
a delicate morsel of the fat should be served.

BEEF TONGUE.

Passing the knife down in the direction of from 1 to 2, a not too thin slice should be helped;
and the carving of a tongue may be continued in this way until the best portions of the upper
side are served. The fat which lies about the root of the tongue can be served by turning the
tongue, and cutting in the direction of from 3 to 4.

CHAPTER XIV.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHEEP AND LAMB.

678. OF ALL WILD or DOMESTICATED ANIMALS, the sheep is, without exception, the most useful
to man as a food, and the most necessary to his health and comfort; for it not only supplies
him with the lightest and most nutritious of meats, but, in the absence of the cow, its udder
yields him milk, cream, and a sound though inferior cheese; while from its fat he obtains light,
and from its fleece broadcloth, kerseymere, blankets, gloves, and hose. Its bones when burnt
make an animal charcoal--ivory black--to polish his boots, and when powdered, a manure for
the cultivation of his wheat; the skin, either split or whole, is made into a mat for his carriage,
a housing for his horse, or a lining for his hat, and many other useful purposes besides, being
extensively employed in the manufacture of parchment; and finally, when oppressed by care and
sorrow, the harmonious strains that carry such soothing contentment to the heart, are elicited
from the musical strings, prepared almost exclusively from the intestines of the sheep.

679. THIS VALUABLE ANIMAL, of which England is estimated to maintain an average stock of 32,000,000,
belongs to the class already indicated under the ox,--the Mammalia; to the order of Rumenantia,
or cud-chewing animal; to the tribe of Capridae, or horned quadrupeds; and the genus Ovis,
or the "sheep." The sheep may be either with or without horns; when present, however, they
have always this peculiarity, that they spring from a triangular base, are spiral in form,
and lateral, at the side of the head, in situation. The fleece of the sheep is of two sorts,
either short and harsh, or soft and woolly; the wool always preponderating in an exact ratio
to the care, attention, and amount of domestication bestowed on the animal. The generic peculiarities
of the sheep are the triangular and spiral form of the horns, always larger in the male when
present, but absent in the most cultivated species; having sinuses at the base of all the toes
of the four feet, with two rudimentary hoofs on the fore legs, two inguinal teats to the udder,
with a short tail in the wild breed, but of varying length in the domesticated; have no incisor
teeth in the upper jaw, but in their place a hard elastic cushion along the margin of the gum,
on which the animal nips and breaks the herbage on which it feeds; in the lower jaw there are
eight incisor teeth and six molars on each side of both jaws, making in all 32 teeth. The fleece
consists of two coats, one to keep the animal warm, the other to carry off the water without
wetting the skin. The first is of wool, the weight and fineness of which depend on the quality
of the pasture and the care bestowed on the flock; the other of hair, that pierces the wool
and overlaps it, and is in excess in exact proportion to the badness of the keep and inattention
with which the animal is treated.

680. THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE GRAZIER is to procure an animal that will yield the greatest pecuniary
return in the shortest time; or, in other words, soonest convert grass and turnips into good
mutton and fine fleece. All sheep will not do this alike; some, like men, are so restless and
irritable, that no system of feeding, however good, will develop their frames or make them
fat. The system adopted by the breeder to obtain a valuable animal for the butcher, is to enlarge
the capacity and functions of the digestive organs, and reduce those of the head and chest,
or the mental and respiratory organs. In the first place, the mind should be tranquillized,
and those spaces that can never produce animal fibre curtailed, and greater room afforded,
as in the abdomen, for those that can. And as nothing militates against the fattening process
so much as restlessness, the chief wish of the grazier is to find a dull, indolent sheep, one
who, instead of frisking himself, leaping his wattles, or even condescending to notice the
butting gambols of his silly companions, silently fills his paunch with pasture, and then seeking
a shady nook, indolently and luxuriously chows his cud with closed eyes and blissful satisfaction,
only rising when his delicious repast is ended, to proceed silently and without emotion to
repeat the pleasing process of laying in more provender, and then returning to his dreamy siesta
to renew the delightful task of rumination. Such animals are said to have a lymphatic temperament,
and are of so kindly a nature, that on good pasturage they may be said to grow daily. The Leicestershire
breed is the best example of this lymphatic and contented animal, and the active Orkney, who
is half goat in his habits, of the restless and unprofitable. The rich pasture of our midland
counties would take years in making the wiry Orkney fat and profitable, while one day's fatigue
in climbing rocks after a coarse and scanty herbage would probably cause the actual death of
the pampered and short-winded Leicester.

681. THE MORE REMOVED FROM THE NATURE of the animal is the food on which it lives, the more
difficult is the process of assimilation, and the more complex the chain of digestive organs;
for it must be evident to all, that the same apparatus that converts flesh into flesh, is hardly
calculated to transmute grass into flesh. As the process of digestion in carnivorous animals
is extremely simple, these organs are found to be remarkably short, seldom exceeding the length
of the animal's body; while, where digestion is more difficult, from the unassimilating nature
of the aliment, as in the ruminant order, the alimentary canal, as is the case with the sheep,
is twenty-seven times the length of the body. The digestive organ in all ruminant animals consists
of four stomachs, or, rather, a capacious pouch, divided by doorways and valves into four compartments,
called, in their order of position, the Paunch, the Reticulum, the Omasum, and the Abomasum.
When the sheep nibbles the grass, and is ignorantly supposed to be eating, he is, in fact,
only preparing the raw material of his meal, in reality only mowing the pasture, which, as
he collects, is swallowed instantly, passing into the first receptacle, the paunch, where it
is surrounded by a quantity of warm saliva, in which the herbage undergoes a process of maceration
or softening, till the animal having filled this compartment, the contents pass through a valve
into the second or smaller bag,--the reticulum, where, having again filled the paunch with
a reserve, the sheep lies down and commences that singular process of chewing the cud, or,
in other words, masticating the food he has collected. By the operation of a certain set of
muscles, a small quantity of this softened food from the reticulum, or second bag, is passed
into the mouth, which it now becomes the pleasure of the sheep to grind under his molar teeth
into a soft smooth pulp, the operation being further assisted by a flow of saliva, answering
the double purpose of increasing the flavour of the aliment and promoting the solvency of the
mass. Having completely comminuted and blended this mouthful, it is swallowed a second time;
but instead of returning to the paunch or reticulum, it passes through another valve into a
side cavity,--the omasum, where, after a maceration in more saliva for some hours, it glides
by the same contrivance into the fourth pouch,--the abomasum, an apartment in all respects
analogous to the ordinary stomach of animals, and where the process of digestion, begun and
carried on in the previous three, is here consummated, and the nutrient principle, by means
of the bile, eliminated from the digested aliment. Such is the process of digestion in sheep
and oxen.

682. NO OTHER ANIMAL, even of the same order, possesses in so remarkable a degree the power
of converting pasture into flesh as the Leicestershire sheep; the South Down and Cheviot, the
two next breeds in quality, are, in consequence of the greater vivacity of the animal's nature,
not equal to it in that respect, though in both the brain and chest are kept subservient to
the greater capacity of the organs of digestion. Besides the advantage of increased bulk and
finer fleeces, the breeder seeks to obtain an augmented deposit of tissue in those parts of
the carcase most esteemed as food, or, what are called in the trade "prime joints;" and so
far has this been effected, that the comparative weight of the hind quarters over the fore
has become a test of quality in the breed, the butchers in some markets charging twopence a
pound more for that portion of the sheep. Indeed, so superior are the hind quarters of mutton
now regarded, that very many of the West-end butchers never deal in any other part of the sheep.

683. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH in various breeds is a well-established fact,
not alone in flavour, but also in tenderness; and that the nature of the pasture on which the
sheep is fed influences the flavour of the meat, is equally certain, and shown in the estimation
in which those flocks are held which have grazed on the thymy heath of Bamstead in Sussex.
It is also a well-established truth, that the larger the frame of the animal, the coarser is
the meat, and that small bones are both guarantees for the fineness of the breed and the delicacy
of the flesh. The sex too has much to do in determining the quality of the meat; in the males,
the lean is closer in fibre, deeper in colour, harder in texture, less juicy, and freer from
fat, than in the female, and is consequently tougher and more difficult of digestion; but probably
age, and the character of the pasturage on which they are reared, has, more than any other
cause, an influence on the quality and tenderness of the meat.

684. THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES of sheep inhabiting the different regions of the earth have been
reduced by Cuvier to three, or at most four, species: the Ovis Amman, or the Argali, the presumed
parent stock of all the rest; the Ovis Tragelaphus, the bearded sheep of Africa; the Ovis Musmon,
the Musmon of Southern Europe; and the Ovis Montana, the Mouflon of America; though it is believed
by many naturalists that this last is so nearly identical with the Indian Argali as to be undeserving
a separate place. It is still a controversy to which of these three we are indebted for the
many breeds of modern domestication; the Argali, however, by general belief, has been considered
as the most probable progenitor of the present varieties.

685. THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY CHANGE OF CLIMATE, accident, and other causes, must have been
great to accomplish so complete a physical alteration as the primitive Argali must have undergone
before the Musmon, or Mouflon of Corsica, the immediate progenitor of all our European breeds,
assumed his present appearance. The Argali is about a fifth larger in size than the ordinary
English sheep, and being a native of a tropical clime, his fleece is of hair instead of wool,
and of a warm reddish brown, approaching to yellow; a thick mane of darker hair, about seven
inches long, commences from two long tufts at the angle of the jaws, and, running under the
throat and neck, descends down the chest, dividing, at the fore fork, into two parts, one running
down the front of each leg, as low as the shank. The horns, unlike the character of the order
generally, have a quadrangular base, and, sweeping inwards, terminate in a sharp point. The
tail, about seven inches long, ends in a tuft of stiff hairs. From this remarkable muffler-looking
beard, the French have given the species the name of Mouflon à manchettes. From the primitive
stock eleven varieties have been reared in this country, of the domesticated sheep, each supposed
by their advocates to possess some one or more special qualities. These eleven, embracing the
Shetland or Orkney; the Dun-woolled; Black-faced, or heath-bred; the Moorland, or Devonshire;
the Cheviot; the Horned, of Norfolk the Ryeland; South-Down; the Merino; the Old Leicester,
and the Teeswater, or New Leicester, have of late years been epitomized; and, for all useful
and practical purposes, reduced to the following four orders:--

686. THE SOUTH-DOWN, the LEICESTER, the BLACK-FACED, and the CHEVIOT.

687. SOUTH-DOWNS.--It appears, as far as our investigation can trace the fact, that from the
very earliest epoch of agricultural history in England, the breezy range of light chalky hills
running through the south-west and south of Sussex and Hampshire, and known as the South-Downs,
has been famous for a superior race of sheep; and we find the Romans early established mills
and a cloth-factory at Winchester, where they may be said to terminate, which rose to such
estimation, from the fineness of the wool and texture of the cloth, that the produce was kept
as only worthy to clothe emperors. From this, it may be inferred that sheep have always been
indigenous to this hilly tract. Though boasting so remote a reputation, it is comparatively
within late years that the improvement and present state of perfection of this breed has been
effected, the South-Down new ranking, for symmetry of shape, constitution, and early maturity,
with any stock in the kingdom. The South-Down has no horns, is covered with a fine wool from
two to three inches long, has a small head, and legs and face of a grey colour. It is, however,
considered deficient in depth and breadth of chest. A marked peculiarity of this breed is that
its hind quarters stand higher than the fore, the quarters weighing from fifteen to eighteen
pounds.

688. THE LEICESTER.--It was not till the year 1755 that Mr. Robert Bakewell directed his attention
to the improvement of his stock of sheep, and ultimately effected that change in the character
of his flock which has brought the breed to hold so prominent a place. The Leicester is regarded
as the largest example of the improved breeds, very productive, and yielding a good fleece.
He has a small head, covered with short white hairs, a clean muzzle, an open countenance, full
eye, long thin ear, tapering neck, well-arched ribs, and straight back. The meat is indifferent,
its flavour not being so good as that of the South-Down, and there is a very large proportion
of fat. Average weight of carcase from 90 to 100 lbs.

689. BLACK-FACED, on HEATH-BRED SHEEP.--This is the most hardy of all our native breeds, and
originally came from Ettrick Forest. The face and legs are black, or sometimes mottled, the
horns spiral, and on the top of the forehead it has a small round tuft of lighter-coloured
wool than on the face; has the muzzle and lips of the same light hue, and what shepherds call
a mealy mouth; the eye is full of vivacity and fire, and well open; the body long, round, and
firm, and the limbs robust. The wool is thin, coarse, and light. Weight of the quarter, from
10 to 16 lbs.

690. THE CHEVIOT.--From the earliest traditions, these hills in the North, like the chalk-ridges
in the South, have possessed a race of large-carcased sheep, producing a valuable fleece. To
these physical advantages, they added a sound constitution, remarkable vigour, and capability
to endure great privation. Both sexes are destitute of horns, face white, legs long and clean,
carries the head erect, has the throat and neck well covered, the cars long and open, and the
face animated. The Cheviot is a small-boned sheep, and well covered with wool to the hough;
the only defect in this breed, is in a want of depth in the chest. Weight of the quarter, from
12 to 18 lbs.

691. THOUGH THE ROMNEY MARSHES, that wide tract of morass and lowland moor extending from the
Weald (or ancient forest) of Kent into Sussex, has rather been regarded as a general feeding-ground
for any kind of sheep to be pastured on, it has yet, from the earliest date, been famous for
a breed of animals almost peculiar to the locality, and especially for size, length, thickness,
and quantity of wool, and what is called thickness of stocking; and on this account for ages
held pre-eminence over every other breed in the kingdom. So satisfied were the Kentish men
with the superiority of their sheep, that they long resisted any crossing in the breed. At
length, however, this was effected, and from the Old Romney and New Leicester a stock was produced
that proved, in an eminent degree, the advantage of the cross; and though the breed was actually
smaller than the original, it was found that the new stock did not consume so much food, the
stocking was increased, they were ready for the market a year sooner; that the fat formed more
on the exterior of the carcase, where it was of most advantage to the grazier, rather than
as formerly in the interior, where it went to the butcher as offal; and though the wool was
shorter and lighter, it was of a better colour, finer, and possessed of superior felting properties.

692. THE ROMNEY MARSH BREED is a large animal, deep, close, and compact, with white face and
legs, and yields a heavy fleece of a good staple quality. The general structure is, however,
considered defective, the chest being narrow and the extremities coarse; nevertheless its tendency
to fatten, and its early maturity, are universally admitted. The Romney Marsh, therefore, though
not ranking as a first class in respect of perfection and symmetry of breed, is a highly useful,
profitable, and generally advantageous variety of the English domestic sheep.

693. DIFFERENT NAMES HAVE BEEN GIVEN to sheep by their breeders, according to their age and
sex. The male is called a ram, or tup; after weaning, he is said to be a hog, or hogget, or
a lamb-hog, tup-hog, or teg; later he is a wether, or wether-hog; after the first shearing,
a shearing, or dinmont; and after each succeeding shearing, a two, three, or four-shear ram,
tup, or wether, according to circumstances. The female is called a ewe, or gimmer-lamb, till
weaned, when she becomes, according to the shepherd's nomenclature, a gimmer-ewe, hog, or teg;
after shearing, a gimmer or shearing-ewe, or theave; and in future a two, three, or four-shear
ewe, or theave.

694. THE MODE OF SLAUGHTERING SHEEP is perhaps as humane and expeditious a process as could
be adopted to attain the objects sought: the animal being laid on its side in a sort of concave
stool, the butcher, while pressing the body with his knee, transfixes the throat near the angle
of the jaw, passing his knife between the windpipe and bones of the neck; thus dividing the
jugulars, carotids, and large vessels, the death being very rapid from such a hemorrhage.

695. ALMOST EVERY LARGE CITY has a particular manner of cutting up, or, as it is called, dressing
the carcase. In London this process is very simple, and as our butchers have found that much
skewering back, doubling one part over another, or scoring the inner cuticle or fell, tends
to spoil the meat and shorten the time it would otherwise keep, they avoid all such treatment
entirely. The carcase when flayed (which operation is performed while yet warm), the sheep
when hung up and the head removed, presents the profile shown in our cut; the small numerals
indicating the parts or joints into which one half of the animal is cut. After separating the
hind from the fore quarters, with eleven ribs to the latter, the quarters are usually subdivided
in the manner shown in the sketch, in which the several joins are defined by the intervening
lines and figures. Hind quarter: No. 1, the leg; 2, the loin--the two, when cut in one piece,
being called the saddle. Fore quarter: No. 3, the shoulder; 4 and 5 the neck; No. 5 being called,
for distinction, the scrag, which is generally afterwards separated from 4, the lower and better
joint; No. 6, the breast. The haunch of mutton, so often served at public dinners and special
entertainments, comprises all the leg and so much of the loin, short of the ribs or lap, as
is indicated on the upper part of the carcase by a dotted line.

696. THE GENTLE AND TIMID DISPOSITION of the sheep, and its defenceless condition, must very
early have attached it to man for motives less selfish than either its fleece or its flesh;
for it has been proved beyond a doubt that, obtuse as we generally regard it, it is susceptible
of a high degree of domesticity, obedience, and affection. In many parts of Europe, where the
flocks are guided by the shepherd's voice alone, it is no unusual thing for a sheep to quit
the herd when called by its name, and follow the keeper like a dog. In the mountains of Scotland,
when a flock is invaded by a savage dog, the rams have been known to form the herd into a circle,
and placing themselves on the outside line, keep the enemy at bay, or charging on him in a
troop, have despatched him with their horns.

697. THE VALUE OF THE SHEEP seems to have been early understood by Adam in his fallen state;
his skin not only affording him protection for his body, but a covering for his tent; and accordingly,
we find Abel intrusted with this portion of his father's stock; for the Bible tells us that
"Abel was a keeper of sheep." What other animals were domesticated at that time we can only
conjecture, or at what exact period the flesh of the sheep was first eaten for food by man,
is equally, if not uncertain, open to controversy. For though some authorities maintain the
contrary, it is but natural to suppose that when Abel brought firstlings of his flock, "and
the fat thereof," as a sacrifice, the less dainty portions, not being oblations, were hardly
likely to have been flung away as refuse. Indeed, without supposing Adam and his descendants
to have eaten animal food, we cannot reconcile the fact of Jubal Cain, Cain's son, and his
family, living in tents, as they are reported to have done, knowing that both their own garments
and the coverings of the tents, were made from the hides and skins of the animals they bred;
for the number of sheep and oxen slain for oblations only, would not have supplied sufficient
material for two such necessary purposes. The opposite opinion is, that animal food was not
eaten till after the Flood, when the Lord renewed his covenant with Noah. From Scriptural authority
we learn many interesting facts as regards the sheep: the first, that mutton fat was considered
the most delicious portion of any meat, and the tail and adjacent part the most exquisite morsel
in the whole body; consequently, such were regarded as especially fit for the offer of sacrifice.
From this fact we may reasonably infer that the animal still so often met with in Palestine
and Syria, and known as the Fat-tailed sheep, was in use in the days of the patriarchs, though
probably not then of the size and weight it now attains to; a supposition that gains greater
strength, when it is remembered that the ram Abraham found in the bush, when he went to offer
up Isaac, was a horned animal, being entangled in the brake by his curved horns; so far proving
that it belonged to the tribe of the Capridae, the fat-tailed sheep appertaining to the same
family.

LAMBS.

698. THOUGH THE LAMBING SEASON IN THIS COUNTRY usually commences in March, under the artificial
system, so much pursued now to please the appetite of luxury, lambs can be procured at all
seasons. When, however, the sheep lambs in mid-winter, or the inclemency of the weather would
endanger the lives of mother and young, if exposed to its influence, it is customary to rear
the lambs within-doors, and under the shelter of stables or barns, where, foddered on soft
hay, and part fed on cow's milk, the little creatures thrive rapidly: to such it is customary
to give the name of House Lamb, to distinguish it from that reared in the open air, or grass-fed.
The ewe goes five months with her young, about 152 days, or close on 22 weeks. The weaning
season commences on poor lands, about the end of the third month, but on rich pasture not till
the close of the fourth--sometimes longer.

699. FROM THE LARGE PROPORTION OF MOISTURE OR FLUIDS contained in the tissues of all young
animals, the flesh of lamb and veal is much more prone, in close, damp weather, to become tainted
and spoil than the flesh of the more mature, drier, and closer-textured beef and mutton. Among
epicures, the most delicious sorts of lamb are those of the South-Down breed, known by their
black feet; and of these, those which have been exclusively suckled on the milk of the parent
ewe, are considered the finest. Next to these in estimation are those fed on the milk of several
dams, and last of all, though the fattest, the grass-fed lamb; this, however, implies an age
much greater than either of the others.

700. LAMB, in the early part of the season, however reared, is in London, and indeed generally,
sold in quarters, divided with eleven ribs to the forequarter; but, as the season advances,
these are subdivided into two, and the hind-quarter in the same manner; the first consisting
of the shoulder, and the neck and breast; the latter, of the leg and the loin,--as shown in
the cut illustrative of mutton. As lamb, from the juicy nature of its flesh, is especially
liable to spoil in unfavourable weather, it should be frequently wiped, so as to remove any
moisture that may form on it.

701. IN THE PURCHASING OF LAMB FOR THE TABLE, there are certain signs by which the experienced
judgment is able to form an accurate opinion whether the animal has been lately slaughtered,
and whether the joints possess that condition of fibre indicative of good and wholesome meat.
The first of these doubts may be solved satisfactorily by the bright and dilated appearance
of the eye; the quality of the fore-quarter can always be guaranteed by the blue or healthy
ruddiness of the jugular, or vein of the neck; while the rigidity of the knuckle, and the firm,
compact feel of the kidney, will answer in an equally positive manner for the integrity of
the hind-quarter.

702. MODE OF CUTTING UP A SIDE OF LAMB IN LONDON.--1, 1. Ribs; 2. Breast; 3. Shoulder; 4. Loin;
5. Leg; 1,2,3. Fore Quarter.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XV.

BAKED MINCED MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).

703.

Mode.--Mince an onion rather fine, and fry it a light-brown colour; add the herbs and mutton,
both of which should be also finely minced and well mixed; season with pepper and salt, and
a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and moisten with the above proportion of gravy. Put a layer
of mashed potatoes at the bottom of a dish, then the mutton, and then another layer of potatoes,
and bake for about 1/2 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--If there should be a large quantity of meat, use 2 onions instead of 1.

BOILED BREAST OF MUTTON AND CAPER SAUCE.

704. INGREDIENTS.--Breast of mutton, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs
(put a large proportion of parsley), pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Cut off the superfluous fat; bone it; sprinkle over a layer of bread crumbs, minced
herbs, and seasoning; roll, and bind it up firmly. Boil gently for 2 hours, remove the tape,
and serve with caper sauce, No. 382, a little of which should be poured over the meat.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, 6d. per lb.

Sufficient for 4 or 6 persons.

Seasonable all the year.

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.

705. INGREDIENTS.--Mutton, water, salt.

Mode.--A. leg of mutton for boiling should not hang too long, as it will not look a good colour
when dressed. Cut off the shank-bone, trim the knuckle, and wash and wipe it very clean; plunge
it into sufficient boiling water to cover it; let it boil up, then draw the saucepan to the
side of the fire, where it should remain till the finger can be borne in the water. Then place
it sufficiently near the fire, that the water may gently simmer, and be very careful that it
does not boil fast, or the meat will be hard. Skim well, add a little salt, and in about 2-1/4
hours after the water begins to simmer, a moderate-sized leg of mutton will be done. Serve
with carrots and mashed turnips, which may be boiled with the meat, and send caper sauce (No.
382) to table with it in a tureen.

Seasonable nearly all the year, but not so good in June, July, and August.

Note.--When meat is liked very thoroughly cooked, allow more time than stated above. The liquor
this joint was boiled in should be converted into soup.

    THE GOOD SHEPHERD.--The sheep's complete dependence upon the
    shepherd for protection from its numerous enemies is frequently
    referred to in the Bible; thus the Psalmist likens himself to a
    lost sheep, and prays the Almighty to seek his servant; and our
    Saviour, when despatching his twelve chosen disciples to preach
    the Gospel amongst their unbelieving brethren, compares them to
    lambs going amongst wolves. The shepherd of the East, by kind
    treatment, calls forth from his sheep unmistakable signs of
    affection. The sheep obey his voice and recognize the names by
    which he calls them, and they follow him in and out of the fold.
    The beautiful figure of the "good shepherd," which so often
    occurs in the New Testament, expresses the tenderness of the
    Saviour for mankind. "The good shepherd giveth his life for the
    sheep."--John, x. 11. "I am the good shepherd, and know my
    sheep, and am known by mine."--John, x. 14. "And other sheep I
    have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and
    they shall hear my voice: and there shall be one fold and one
    shepherd."--John, x. 16.

BONED LEG OF MUTTON STUFFED.

706. INGREDIENTS.--A small leg of mutton, weighing 6 or 7 lbs., forcemeat, No. 417, 2 shalots
finely minced.

Mode.--Make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417, to which add 2 finely-minced shalots. Bone the leg
of mutton, without spoiling the skin, and cut off a great deal of the fat. Fill the hole up
whence the bone was taken, with the forcemeat, and sew it up underneath, to prevent its falling
out. Bind and tie it up compactly, and roast it before a nice clear fire for about 2-1/2 hours
or rather longer; remove the tape and send it to table with a good gravy. It may be glazed
or not, as preferred.

Time.--2-1/2 hours, or rather longer. Average cost, 4s. 8d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

BRAISED FILLET OF MUTTON, with French Beans.

707. INGREDIENTS.--The chump end of a loin of mutton, buttered paper, French beans, a little
glaze, 1 pint of gravy.

Mode.--Roll up the mutton in a piece of buttered paper, roast it for 2 hours, and do not allow
it to acquire the least colour. Have ready some French beans, boiled, and drained on a sieve;
remove the paper from the mutton, glaze it; just heat up the beans in the gravy, and lay them
on the dish with the meat over them. The remainder of the gravy may be strained, and sent to
table in a tureen.

Seasonable at any time.

    VARIOUS QUALITIES OF MUTTON--Mutton is, undoubtedly, the meat
    most generally used in families; and, both by connoisseurs and
    medical men, it stands first in favour, whether its the favour,
    digestible qualifications, or general wholesomeness, be
    considered. Of all mutton, that furnished by South-Down sheep is
    the most highly esteemed; it is also the dearest, on account of
    its scarcity, and the great demand of it. Therefore, if the
    housekeeper is told by the butcher that he has not any in his
    shop, it should not occasion disappointment to the purchaser.
    The London and other markets are chiefly supplied with sheep
    called half-breeds, which are a cross between the Down and
    Lincoln or Leicester. These half-breeds make a greater weight of
    mutton than the true South-Downs, and, for this very desirable
    qualification, they are preferred by the great sheep-masters.
    The legs of this mutton range from 7 to 11 lbs. in weight; the
    shoulders, necks, or loins, about 6 to 9 lbs.; and if care is
    taken not to purchase it; the shoulders, necks, or loins, about
    8 to 9 lbs.; and it cure is taken not to purchase it too fat, it
    will be found the most satisfactory and economical mutton that
    can be bought.

BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON.

708. INGREDIENTS.--1 small leg of mutton, 4 carrots, 3 onions, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, a
bunch of parsley, seasoning to taste of pepper and salt, a few slices of bacon, a few veal
trimmings, 1/2 pint of gravy or water.

Mode.--Line the bottom of a braising-pan with a few slices of bacon, put in the carrots, onions,
herbs, parsley, and seasoning, and over these place the mutton. Cover the whole with a few
more slices of bacon and the veal trimmings, pour in the gravy or water, and stew very gently
for 4 hours. Strain the gravy, reduce it to a glaze over a sharp fire, glaze the mutton with
it, and send it to table, placed on a dish of white haricot beans boiled tender, or garnished
with glazed onions.

Time.--4 hours. Average cost, 5s.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE.--This order of knighthood was
    founded by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1429, on the
    day of his marriage with the Princess Isabella of Portugal. The
    number of the members was originally fixed at thirty-one,
    including the sovereign, as the head and chief of the
    institution. In 1516, Pope Leo X. consented to increase the
    number to fifty-two, including the head. In 1700 the German
    emperor Charles VI. and King Philip of Spain both laid claim to
    the order. The former, however, on leaving Spain, which he could
    not maintain by force of arms, took with him, to Vienna, the
    archives of the order, the inauguration of which he solemnized
    there in 1713, with great magnificence; but Philip V. of Spain
    declared himself Grand Master, and formally protested, at the
    congress of Cambrai (1721), against the pretensions of the
    emperor. The dispute, though subsequently settled by the
    intercession of France, England, and Holland, was frequently
    renewed, until the order was tacitly introduced into both
    countries, and it now passes by the respective names of the
    Spanish or Austrian "Order of the Golden Fleece," according to
    the country where it is issued.

AN EXCELLENT WAY TO COOK A BREAST OF MUTTON.

709. INGREDIENTS.--Breast of mutton, 2 onions, salt and pepper to taste, flour, a bunch of
savoury herbs, green peas.

Mode.--Cut the mutton into pieces about 2 inches square, and let it be tolerably lean; put
it into a stewpan, with a little fat or butter, and fry it of a nice brown; then dredge in
a little flour, slice the onions, and put it with the herbs in the stewpan; pour in sufficient
water just to cover the meat, and simmer the whole gently until the mutton is tender. Take
out the meat, strain, and skim off all the fat from the gravy, and put both the meat and gravy
back into the stewpan; add about a quart of young green peas, and let them boil gently until
done. 2 or 3 slices of bacon added and stewed with the mutton give additional flavour; and,
to insure the peas being a beautiful green colour, they may be boiled in water separately,
and added to the stew at the moment of serving.

Seasonable from June to August.

    NAMES OF ANIMALS SAXON, AND OF THEIR FLESH NORMAN.--The names of
    all our domestic animals are of Saxon origin; but it is curious
    to observe that Norman names have been given to the different
    sorts of flesh which these animals yield. How beautifully this
    illustrates the relative position of Saxon and Norman after the
    Conquest. The Saxon hind had the charge of tending and feeding
    the domestic animals, but only that they might appear on the
    table of his Norman lord. Thus 'ox,' 'steer,' 'cow,' are Saxon,
    but 'beef' is Norman; 'calf' is Saxon, but 'veal' Norman;
    'sheep' is Saxon, but 'mutton' Norman; so it is severally with
    'deer' and 'venison,' 'swine' and 'pork,' 'fowl' and 'pullet.'
    'Bacon,' the only flesh which, perhaps, ever came within his
    reach, is the single exception.

BROILED MUTTON AND TOMATO SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery).

710. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold mutton, tomato sauce, No. 529.

Mode.--Cut some nice slices from a cold leg or shoulder of mutton; season them with pepper
and salt, and broil over a clear fire. Make some tomato sauce by recipe No. 529, pour it over
the mutton, and serve. This makes an excellent dish, and must be served very hot.

Time.--About 5 minutes to broil the mutton.

Seasonable in September and October, when tomatoes are plentiful and seasonable.

    SHEPHERDS AND THEIR FLOCKS.--The shepherd's crook is older than
    either the husbandman's plough or the warrior's sword. We are
    told that Abel was a keeper of sheep. Many passages in holy writ
    enable us to appreciate the pastoral riches of the first eastern
    nations; and we can form an idea of the number of their flocks,
    when we read that Jacob gave the children of Hamor a hundred
    sheep for the price of a field, and that the king of Israel
    received a hundred thousand every year from the king of Moab,
    his tributary, and a like number of rams covered with their
    fleece. The tendency which most sheep have to ramble, renders it
    necessary for them to be attended by a shepherd. To keep a flock
    within bounds, is no easy task; but the watchful shepherd
    manages to accomplish it without harassing the sheep. In the
    Highlands of Scotland, where the herbage is scanty, the
    sheep-farm requires to be very large, and to be watched over by
    many shepherds. The farms of some of the great Scottish
    landowners are of enormous extent. "How many sheep have you on
    your estate?" asked Prince Esterhazy of the duke of Argyll. "I
    have not the most remote idea," replied the duke; "but I know
    the shepherds number several thousands."

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS.

711. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of mutton, pepper and salt, a small piece of butter.

Mode.--Cut the chops from a well-hung tender loin of mutton, remove a portion of the fat, and
trim them into a nice shape; slightly beat and level them; place the gridiron over a bright
clear fire, rub the bars with a little fat, and lay on the chops. Whilst broiling, frequently
turn them, and in about 8 minutes they will be done. Season with pepper and salt, dish them
on a very hot dish, rub a small piece of butter on each chop, and serve very hot and expeditiously.

Time.--About 8 minutes. Average cost, 10d. per lb.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 chop to each person.

Seasonable at any time.

CHINA CHILO.

712. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of leg, loin, or neck of mutton, 2 onions, 2 lettuces, 1 pint
of green peas, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of pepper, 1/4 pint of water, 1/4 lb. of
clarified butter; when liked, a little cayenne.

Mode.--Mince the above quantity of undressed leg, loin, or neck of mutton, adding a little
of the fat, also minced; put it into a stewpan with the remaining ingredients, previously shredding
the lettuce and onion rather fine; closely cover the stewpan, after the ingredients have been
well stirred, and simmer gently for rather more than 2 hours. Serve in a dish, with a border
of rice round, the same as for curry.

Time.--Rather more than 2 hours. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from June to August.

CURRIED MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).

713. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of any joint of cold mutton, 2 onions, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1
dessertspoonful of curry powder, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, salt to taste, 1/4 pint of stock
or water.

Mode.--Slice the onions in thin rings, and put them into a stewpan with the butter, and fry
of a light brown; stir in the curry powder, flour, and salt, and mix all well together. Cut
the meat into nice thin slices (if there is not sufficient to do this, it may be minced), and
add it to the other ingredients; when well browned, add the stock or gravy, and stew gently
for about 1/2 hour. Serve in a dish with a border of boiled rice, the same as for other curries.

Seasonable in winter.

CUTLETS OF COLD MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).

714. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold loin or neck of mutton, 1 egg, bread crumbs, brown gravy
(No. 436), or tomato sauce (No. 529).

Mode.--Cut the remains of cold loin or neck of mutton into cutlets, trim them, and take away
a portion of the fat, should there be too much; dip them in beaten egg, and sprinkle with bread
crumbs, and fry them a nice brown in hot dripping. Arrange them on a dish, and pour round them
either a good gravy or hot tomato sauce.

Time.--About 7 minutes.

Seasonable.--Tomatoes to be had most reasonably in September and October.

DORMERS.

715. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of cold mutton, 2 oz. of beef suet, pepper and salt to taste, 3
oz. of boiled rice, 1 egg, bread crumbs, made gravy.

Mode.--Chop the meat, suet, and rice finely; mix well together, and add a high seasoning of
pepper and salt, and roll into sausages; cover them with egg and bread crumbs, and fry in hot
dripping of a nice brown. Serve in a dish with made gravy poured round them, and a little in
a tureen.

Time.--1/2 hour to fry the sausages.

Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE GOLDEN FLEECE.--The ancient fable of the Golden Fleece may
    be thus briefly told:--Phryxus, a son of Athamus, king of
    Thebes, to escape the persecutions of his stepmother Ino, paid a
    visit to his friend Aeetes, king of Colchis. A ram, whose fleece
    was of pure gold, carried the youth through the air in a most
    obliging manner to the court of his friend. When safe At
    Colchis, Phryxus offered the ram on the altars of Mars, and
    pocketed the fleece. The king received him with great kindness,
    and gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage; but, some time
    after, he murdered him in order to obtain possession of the
    precious fleece. The murder of Phryxus was amply revenged by the
    Greeks. It gave rise to the famous Argonautic expedition,
    undertaken by Jason and fifty of the most celebrated heroes of
    Greece. The Argonauts recovered the fleece by the help of the
    celebrated sorceress Medea, daughter of Aeetes, who fell
    desperately in love with the gallant but faithless Jason. In the
    story of the voyage of the Argo, a substratum of truth probably
    exists, though overlaid by a mass of fiction. The ram which
    carried Phryxus to Colchis is by some supposed to have been the
    name of the ship in which he embarked. The fleece of gold is
    thought to represent the immense treasures he bore away from
    Thebes. The alchemists of the fifteenth century were firmly
    convinced that the Golden Fleece was a treatise on the
    transmutation of metals, written on sheepskin.

HARICOT MUTTON.

I.

716. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of the middle or best end of the neck of mutton, 3 carrots, 3 turnips,
3 onions, popper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup or Harvey's sauce.

Mode.--Trim off some of the fat, cut the mutton into rather thin chops, and put them into a
frying-pan with the fat trimmings. Fry of a pale brown, but do not cook them enough for eating.
Cut the carrots and turnips into dice, and the onions into slices, and slightly fry them in
the same fat that the mutton was browned in, but do not allow them to take any colour. Now
lay the mutton at the bottom of a stewpan, then the vegetables, and pour over them just sufficient
boiling water to cover the whole. Give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on the side
of the fire to simmer gently until the meat is tender. Skim off every particle of fat, add
a seasoning of pepper and salt, and a little ketchup, and serve. This dish is very much better
if made the day before it is wanted for table, as the fat can be so much more easily removed
when the gravy is cold. This should be particularly attended to, as it is apt to be rather
rich and greasy if eaten the same day it is made. It should be served in rather a deep dish.

Time.--2-1/2 hours to simmer gently.

Average cost, for this quantity, 3s.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

II.

717. INGREDIENTS.--Breast or scrag of mutton, flour, pepper and salt to taste, 1 large onion,
3 cloves, a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 blade of mace, carrots and turnips, sugar.

Mode.--Cut the mutton into square pieces, and fry them a nice colour; then dredge over them
a little flour and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Put all into a stewpan, and moisten with
boiling water, adding the onion, stuck with 3 cloves, the mace, and herbs. Simmer gently till
the meat is nearly done, skim off all the fat, and then add the carrots and turnips, which
should previously be cut in dice and fried in a little sugar to colour them. Let the whole
simmer again for 10 minutes; take out the onion and bunch of herbs, and serve.

Time.--About 3 hours to simmer.

HARICOT MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).

718. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold neck or loin of mutton, 2 oz. of butter, 3 onions, 1
dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of good gravy, pepper and salt to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls
of port wine, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 1 head of celery.

Mode.--Cut the cold mutton into moderate-sized chops, and take off the fat; slice the onions,
and fry them with the chops, in a little butter, of a nice brown colour; stir in the flour,
add the gravy, and let it stew gently nearly an hour. In the mean time boil the vegetables
until nearly tender, slice them, and add them to the mutton about 1/4 hour before it is to
be served.

Seasonable at any time.

HASHED MUTTON.

719.

Mode.--Cut the meat in nice even slices from the bones, trimming off all superfluous fat and
gristle; chop the bones and fragments of the joint, put them into a stewpan with the pepper,
spice, herbs, and celery; cover with water, and simmer for 1 hour. Slice and fry the onion
of a nice pale-brown colour, dredge in a little flour to make it thick, and add this to the
bones, &c. Stew for 1/4 hour, strain the gravy, and let it cool; then skim off every particle
of fat, and put it, with the meat, into a stewpan. Flavour with ketchup, Harvey's sauce; tomato
sauce, or any flavouring that may be preferred, and let the meat gradually warm through, but
not boil, or it will harden. To hash meat properly, it should be laid in cold gravy, and only
left on the fire just long enough to warm through.

Time.--1-1/2 hour to simmer the gravy.

Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 4d.

Seasonable at any time.

    HASHED MUTTON.--Many persons express a decided aversion to
    hashed mutton; and, doubtless, this dislike has arisen from the
    fact that they have unfortunately never been properly served
    with this dish. If properly done, however, the meat tender (it
    ought to be as tender as when first roasted), the gravy abundant
    and well flavoured, and the sippets nicely toasted, and the
    whole served neatly; then, hashed mutton is by no means to be
    despised, and is infinitely more wholesome and appetizing than
    the cold leg or shoulder, of which fathers and husbands, and
    their bachelor friends, stand in such natural awe.

HODGE-PODGE (Cold Meat Cookery).

720. INGREDIENTS.--About 1 lb. of underdone cold mutton, 2 lettuces, 1 pint of green peas,
5 or 6 green onions, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 teacupful of water.

Mode.--Mince the mutton, and cut up the lettuces and onions in slices. Put these in a stewpan,
with all the ingredients except the peas, and let these simmer very gently for 3/4 hour, keeping
them well stirred. Boil the peas separately, mix these with the mutton, and serve very hot.

Time.--3/4 hour.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from the end of May to August.

IRISH STEW.

I.

721. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of the loin or neck of mutton, 5 lbs. of potatoes, 5 large onions,
pepper and salt to taste, rather more than 1 pint of water.

Mode.--Trim off some of the fat of the above quantity of loin or neck of mutton, and cut it
into chops of a moderate thickness. Pare and halve the potatoes, and cut the onions into thick
slices. Put a layer of potatoes at the bottom of a stewpan, then a layer of mutton and onions,
and season with pepper and salt; proceed in this manner until the stewpan is full, taking care
to have plenty of vegetables at the top. Pour in the water, and let it stew very gently for
2-1/2 hours, keeping the lid of the stewpan closely shut the whole time, and occasionally shaking
it to prevent its burning.

Time.--2-1/2 hours.

Average cost, for this quantity, 2s. 8d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable.--More suitable for a winter dish.

II.

722. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 lbs. of the breast of mutton, 1-1/2 pint of water, salt and pepper
to taste, 4 lbs. of potatoes, 4 large onions.

Mode.--Put the mutton into a stewpan with the water and a little salt, and let it stew gently
for an hour; cut the meat into small pieces, skim the fat from the gravy, and pare and slice
the potatoes and onions. Put all the ingredients into the stewpan in layers, first a layer
of vegetables, then one of meat, and sprinkle seasoning of pepper and salt between each layer;
cover closely, and let the whole stew very gently for 1 hour of rather more, shaking it frequently
to prevent its burning.

Note.--Irish stew may be prepared in the same manner as above, but baked in a jar instead of
boiled. About 2 hours or rather more in a moderate oven will be sufficient time to bake it.

ITALIAN MUTTON CUTLETS.

723. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the neck of mutton, clarified butter, the yolk of 1 egg,
4 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 1 tablespoonful of minced savoury herbs, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, 1 saltspoonful of finely-chopped lemon-peel;
pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste; flour, 1/2 pint of hot broth or water, 2 teaspoonfuls
of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of soy, 2 teaspoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, 1 tablespoonful
of port wine.

Mode.--Cut the mutton into nicely-shaped cutlets, flatten them, and trim off some of the fat,
dip them in clarified butter, and then, into the beaten yolk of an egg. Mix well together bread
crumbs, herbs, parsley, shalot, lemon-peel, and seasoning in the above proportion, and cover
the cutlets with these ingredients. Melt some butter in a frying-pan, lay in the cutlets, and
fry them a nice brown; take them, out, and keep them hot before the fire. Dredge some flour
into the pan, and if there is not sufficient butter, add a little more; stir till it looks
brown, then pour in the hot broth or water, and the remaining ingredients; give one boil, and
pour round the cutlets. If the gravy should not be thick enough, add a little more flour. Mushrooms,
when obtainable, are a great improvement to this dish, and when not in season, mushroom-powder
may be substituted for them.

Time.--10 minutes;--rather longer, should the cutlets be very thick.

Average cost, 2s. 9d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE DOWNS.--The well-known substance chalk, which the chemist
    regards as a nearly pure carbonate of lime, and the microscopist
    as an aggregation of inconceivably minute shells and corals,
    forms the sub-soil of the hilly districts of the south-east of
    England. The chalk-hills known as the South Downs start from the
    bold promontory of Beachy Head, traverse the county of Sussex
    from east to west, and pass through Hampshire into Surrey. The
    North Downs extend from Godalming, by Godstone, into Kent, and
    terminate in the line of cliffs which stretches from Dover to
    Ramsgate. The Downs are clothed with short verdant turf; but the
    layer of soil which rests upon the chalk is too thin to support
    trees and shrubs. The hills have rounded summits, and their
    smooth, undulated outlines are unbroken save by the sepulchral
    monuments of the early inhabitants of the country. The coombes
    and furrows, which ramify and extend into deep valleys, appear
    like dried-up channels of streams and rivulets. From time
    immemorial, immense flocks of sheep have been reared on these
    downs. The herbage of these hills is remarkably nutritious; and
    whilst the natural healthiness of the climate, consequent on the
    dryness of the air and the moderate elevation of the land, is
    eminently favourable to rearing a superior race of sheep, the
    arable land in the immediate neighbourhood of the Downs affords
    the means of a supply of other food, when the natural produce of
    the hills fails. The mutton of the South-Down breed of sheep is
    highly valued for its delicate flavour, and the wool for its
    fineness; but the best specimens of this breed, when imported
    from England into the West Indies, become miserably lean in the
    course of a year or two, and their woolly fleece gives place to
    a covering of short, crisp, brownish hair.

BROILED KIDNEYS (a Breakfast or Supper Dish).

724. INGREDIENTS.--Sheep kidneys, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Ascertain that the kidneys are fresh, and cut them open very evenly, lengthwise, down
to the root, for should one half be thicker than the other, one would be underdone whilst the
other would be dried, but do not separate them; skin them, and pass a skewer under the white
part of each half to keep them flat, and broil over a nice clear fire, placing the inside downwards;
turn them when done enough on one side, and cook them on the other. Remove the skewers, place
the kidneys on a very hot dish, season with pepper and salt, and put a tiny piece of butter
in the middle of each; serve very hot and quickly, and send very hot plates to table.

Time.--6 to 8 minutes.

Average cost, 1-1/2d. each.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 for each person.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--A prettier dish than the above may be made by serving the kidneys each on a piece of
buttered toast out in any fanciful shape. In this case a little lemon-juice will be found an
improvement.

FRIED KIDNEYS.

725. INGREDIENTS.--Kidneys, butter, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Cut the kidneys open without quite dividing them, remove the skin, and put a small piece
of butter in the frying-pan. When the butter is melted, lay in the kidneys the flat side downwards,
and fry them for 7 or 8 minutes, turning them when they are half-done. Serve on a piece of
dry toast, season with pepper and salt, and put a small piece of butter in each kidney; pour
the gravy from the pan over them, and serve very hot.

Seasonable at any time.

ROAST HAUNCH OF MUTTON.

726. INGREDIENTS.--Haunch of mutton, a little salt, flour.

Mode.--Let this joint hang as long as possible without becoming tainted, and while hanging
dust flour over it, which keeps off the flies, and prevents the air from getting to it. If
not well hung, the joint, when it comes to table, will neither do credit to the butcher or
the cook, as it will not be tender. Wash the outside well, lest it should have a bad flavour
from keeping; then flour it and put it down to a nice brisk fire, at some distance, so that
it may gradually warm through. Keep continually basting, and about 1/2 hour before it is served,
draw it nearer to the fire to get nicely brown. Sprinkle a little fine salt over the meat,
pour off the dripping, add a little boiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the
joint. Place a paper ruche on the bone, and send red-currant jelly and gravy in a tureen to
table with it.

    HOW TO BUY MEAT ECONOMICALLY.--If the housekeeper is not very
    particular as to the precise joints to cook for dinner, there is
    oftentimes an opportunity for her to save as much money in her
    purchases of meat as will pay for the bread to eat with it. It
    often occurs, for instance, that the butcher may have a
    superfluity of certain joints, and these he would be glad to get
    rid of at a reduction of sometimes as much as 1d. or 1-1/2d. per
    lb., and thus, in a joint of 8 or 9 lbs., will be saved enough
    to buy 2 quartern loaves. It frequently happens with many
    butchers, that, in consequence of a demand for legs and loins of
    mutton, they have only shoulders left, and these they will be
    glad to sell at a reduction.

ROAST LEG OF MUTTON.

727. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of mutton, a little salt.

Mode.--As mutton, when freshly killed, is never tender, hang it almost as long as it will keep;
flour it, and put it in a cool airy place for a few days, if the weather will permit. Wash
off the flour, wipe it very dry, and cut off the shank-bone; put it down to a brisk clear fire,
dredge with flour, and keep continually basting the whole time it is cooking.

Seasonable at any time, but not so good in June, July, and August.

ROAST LOIN OF MUTTON.

728. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of mutton, a little salt.

Mode.--Cut and trim off the superfluous fat, and see that the butcher joints the meat properly,
as thereby much annoyance is saved to the carver, when it comes to table. Have ready a nice
clear fire (it need not be a very wide large one), put down the meat, dredge with flour, and
baste well until it is done. Make the gravy as for roast leg of mutton, and serve very hot.

Time.--A loin of mutton weighing 6 lbs., 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer.

ROLLED LOIN OF MUTTON (Very Excellent).

729. INGREDIENTS.--About 6 lbs. of a loin of mutton, 1/2 teaspoonful of pepper, 1/4 teaspoonful
of pounded allspice, 1/4 teaspoonful of mace, 1/4 teaspoonful of nutmeg, 6 cloves, forcemeat
No. 417, 1 glass of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.

Mode.--Hang the mutton till tender, bone it, and sprinkle over it pepper, mace, cloves, allspice,
and nutmeg in the above proportion, all of which must be pounded very fine. Let it remain for
a day, then make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417, cover the meat with it, and roll and bind it
up firmly. Half bake it in a slow oven, let it grow cold, take off the fat, and put the gravy
into a stewpan; flour the meat, put it in the gravy, and stew it till perfectly tender. Now
take out the meat, unbind it, add to the gravy wine and ketchup as above, give one boil, and
pour over the meat. Serve with red-currant jelly; and, if obtainable, a few mushrooms stewed
for a few minutes in the gravy, will be found a great improvement.

Time.--1-1/2 hour to bake the meat, 1-1/2 hour to stew gently.

Average cost, 4s. 9d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--This joint will be found very nice if rolled and stuffed, as here directed, and plainly
roasted. It should be well basted, and served with a good gravy and currant jelly.

BOILED NECK OF MUTTON.

730. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of the middle, or best end of the neck of mutton; a little salt.

Mode.--Trim off a portion of the fat, should there be too much, and if it is to look particularly
nice, the chine-bone should be sawn down, the ribs stripped halfway down, and the ends of the
bones chopped off; this is, however, not necessary. Put the meat into sufficient boiling water
to cover it; when it boils, add a little salt and remove all the scum. Draw the saucepan to
the side of the fire, and let the water get so cool that the finger may be borne in it; then
simmer very slowly and gently until the meat is done, which will be in about 1-1/2 hour, or
rather more, reckoning from the time that it begins to simmer.

Serve with turnips and caper sauce, No. 382, and pour a little of it over the meat. The turnips
should be boiled with the mutton; and, when at hand, a few carrots will also be found an improvement.
These, however, if very large and thick, must be cut into long thinnish pieces, or they will
not be sufficiently done by the time the mutton is ready. Garnish the dish with carrots and
turnips placed alternately round the mutton.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE POETS ON SHEEP.--The keeping of flocks seems to have been
    the first employment of mankind; and the most ancient sort of
    poetry was probably pastoral. The poem known as the Pastoral
    gives a picture of the life of the simple shepherds of the
    golden age, who are supposed to have beguiled their time in
    singing. In all pastorals, repeated allusions are made to the
    "fleecy flocks," the "milk-white lambs," and "the tender ewes;"
    indeed, the sheep occupy a position in these poems inferior only
    to that of the shepherds who tend them. The "nibbling sheep" has
    ever been a favourite of the poets, and has supplied them with
    figures and similes without end. Shakspere frequently compares
    men to sheep. When Gloster rudely drives the lieutenant from the
    side of Henry VI., the poor king thus touchingly speaks of his
    helplessness;--

      "So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf:
       So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,
       And next his throat, unto the butcher's knife."

    In the "Two Gentlemen of Verona," we meet with the following
    humorous comparison:--

    "Proteus. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the
    shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for wages
    followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee;
    therefore, thou art a sheep.

    "Speed. Such another proof will make me cry baa."

    The descriptive poets give us some charming pictures of sheep.
    Every one is familiar with the sheep-shearing scene in Thomson's
    "Seasons:"--

      "Heavy and dripping, to the breezy brow
      Slow move the harmless race; where, as they spread
      Their dwelling treasures to the sunny ray,
      Inly disturb'd, and wond'ring what this wild
      Outrageous tumult means, their loud complaints
      The country fill; and, toss'd from rock to rock,
      Incessant bleatings run around the hills."

    What an exquisite idea of stillness is conveyed in the
    oft-quoted line from Gray's "Elegy:"--

      "And drowsy tinklings lull the distant fold."

    From Dyer's quaint poem of "The Fleece" we could cull a hundred
    passages relating to sheep; but we have already exceeded our
    space.

      "I wat she was a sheep o' sense.
      An' could behave hersel' wi' mense;
      I'll say't, she never brak a fence,
                  Thro' thievish greed.
      Our bardie, lanely, keeps the spence,
                  Sin' Mailie's dead."

MUTTON COLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery).

731. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of a cold leg or loin of mutton, salt and pepper to taste,
1 blade of pounded mace, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs minced very fine, 2 or 3 shalots, 2
or 3 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Cut some very thin slices from a leg or the chump end of a loin of mutton; sprinkle
them with pepper, salt, pounded mace, minced savoury herbs, and minced shalot; fry them in
butter, stir in a dessertspoonful of flour, add the gravy and lemon-juice, simmer very gently
about 5 or 7 minutes, and serve immediately.

MUTTON CUTLETS WITH MASHED POTATOES.

732. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the best end of the neck of mutton, salt and pepper to taste,
mashed potatoes.

Mode.--Procure a well-hung neck of mutton, saw off about 3 inches of the top of the bones,
and cut the cutlets of a moderate thickness. Shape them by chopping off the thick part of the
chine-bone; beat them flat with a cutlet-chopper, and scrape quite clean, a portion of the
top of the bone. Broil them over a nice clear fire for about 7 or 8 minutes, and turn them
frequently. Have ready some smoothly-mashed white potatoes; place these in the middle of the
dish; when the cutlets are done, season with pepper and salt; arrange them round the potatoes,
with the thick end of the cutlets downwards, and serve very hot and quickly. (See Coloured Plate.)

Time.--7 or 8 minutes. Average cost, for this quantity, 2s. 4d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Cutlets may be served in various ways; with peas, tomatoes, onions, sauce piquante, &c.

MUTTON PIE (Cold Meat Cookery).

733. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a cold leg, loin, or neck of mutton, pepper and salt to taste,
2 blades of pounded mace, 1 dessertspoonful of chopped parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced savoury
herbs; when liked, a little minced onion or shalot; 3 or 4 potatoes, 1 teacupful of gravy; crust.

Mode.--Cold mutton may be made into very good pies if well seasoned and mixed with a few herbs;
if the leg is used, cut it into very thin slices; if the loin or neck, into thin cutlets. Place
some at the bottom of the dish; season well with pepper, salt, mace, parsley, and herbs; then
put a layer of potatoes sliced, then more mutton, and so on till the dish is full; add the
gravy, cover with a crust, and bake for 1 hour.

Time.--1 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The remains of an underdone leg of mutton may be converted into a very good family pudding,
by cutting the meat into slices, and putting them into a basin lined with a suet crust. It
should be seasoned well with pepper, salt, and minced shalot, covered with a crust, and boiled
for about 3 hours.

MUTTON PIE.

734. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of the neck or loin of mutton, weighed after being boned; 2 kidneys,
pepper and salt to taste, 2 teacupfuls of gravy or water, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley;
when liked, a little minced onion or shalot; puff crust.

Mode.--Bone the mutton, and cut the meat into steaks all of the same thickness, and leave but
very little fat. Cut up the kidneys, and arrange these with the meat neatly in a pie-dish;
sprinkle over them the minced parsley and a seasoning of pepper and salt; pour in the gravy,
and cover with a tolerably good puff crust. Bake for 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer, should the
pie be very large, and let the oven be rather brisk. A well-made suet crust may be used instead
of puff crust, and will be found exceedingly good.

Time.--1-1/2 hour, or rather longer. Average cost, 2s.

Sufficient for 6 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

MUTTON PUDDING.

735.

Mode.--Cut the meat into rather thin slices, and season them with pepper and salt; line the
pudding-dish with crust; lay in the meat, and nearly, but do not quite, fill it up with water;
when the flavour is liked, add a small quantity of minced onion; cover with crust, and proceed
in the same manner as directed in recipe No. 605, using the same kind of pudding-dish as there
mentioned.

Time.--About 3 hours. Average cost, 1s. 9d.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but more suitable in winter.

RAGOUT OF COLD NECK OF MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).

736.

Mode.--Cut the mutton into small chops, and trim off the greater portion of the fat; put the
butter into a stewpan, dredge in a little flour, add the sliced onions, and keep stirring till
brown; then put in the meat. When this is quite brown, add the water, and the carrots and turnips,
which should be cut into very thin slices; season with pepper and salt, and stew till quite
tender, which will be in about 3/4 hour. When in season, green peas may be substituted for
the carrots and turnips: they should be piled in the centre of the dish, and the chops laid round.

Time.--3/4 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 4d.

Seasonable, with peas, from June to August.

ROAST NECK OF MUTTON.

737. INGREDIENTS.--Neck of mutton; a little salt.

Mode.--For roasting, choose the middle, or the best end, of the neck of mutton, and if there
is a very large proportion of fat, trim off some of it, and save it for making into suet puddings,
which will be found exceedingly good. Let the bones be cut short and see that it is properly
jointed before it is laid down to the fire, as they will be more easily separated when they
come to table. Place the joint at a nice brisk fire, dredge it with flour, and keep continually
basting until done. Red-currant jelly may be sent to table with it.

    WOOLLEN MANUFACTURES.--The distinction between hair and wool is
    rather arbitrary than natural, consisting in the greater or less
    degrees of fineness, softness and pliability of the fibres.
    When the fibres possess these properties so far as to admit of
    their being spun and woven into a texture sufficiently pliable
    to be used as an article of dress, they are called wool. The
    sheep, llama, Angora goat, and the goat of Thibet, are the
    animals from which most of the wool used in manufactures is
    obtained. The finest of all wools is that from the goat of
    Thibet, of which the Cashmere shawls are made. Of European
    wools, the finest is that yielded by the Merino sheep, the
    Spanish and Saxon breeds taking the precedence. The Merino
    sheep, as now naturalized in Australia, furnishes an excellent
    fleece; but all varieties of sheep-wool, reared either in Europe
    or Australia are inferior in softness of feel to that grown in
    India, and to that of the llama of the Andes. The best of our
    British wools are inferior in fineness to any of the
    above-mentioned, being nearly twelve times the thickness of the
    finest Spanish merino; but for the ordinary purposes of the
    manufacturer, they are unrivalled.

ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON.

738. INGREDIENTS.--Saddle of mutton; a little salt.

Mode.--To insure this joint being tender, let it hang for ten days or a fortnight, if the weather
permits. Cut off the tail and flaps and trim away every part that has not indisputable pretensions
to be eaten, and have the skin taken off and skewered on again. Put it down to a bright, clear
fire, and, when the joint has been cooking for an hour, remove the skin and dredge it with
flour. It should not be placed too near the fire, as the fat should not be in the slightest
degree burnt. Keep constantly basting, both before and after the skin is removed; sprinkle
some salt over the joint. Make a little gravy in the dripping-pan; pour it over the meat, which
send to table with a tureen of made gravy and red-currant jelly.

Time.--A saddle of mutton weighing 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours; 14 lbs., 3-1/4 hours. When liked underdone,
allow rather less time.

Average cost, 10d. per lb.

Sufficient.--A moderate-sized saddle of 10 lbs. for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable all the year; not so good when lamb is in full season.

ROAST SHOULDER OF MUTTON.

739. INGREDIENTS.--Shoulder of mutton; a little salt.

Mode.--Put the joint down to a bright, clear fire; flour it well, and keep continually basting.
About 1/4 hour before serving, draw it near the fire, that the outside may acquire a nice brown
colour, but not sufficiently near to blacken the fat. Sprinkle a little fine salt over the
meat, empty the dripping-pan of its contents, pour in a little boiling water slightly salted,
and strain this over the joint. Onion sauce, or stewed Spanish onions, are usually sent to
table with this dish, and sometimes baked potatoes.

Time.--A shoulder of mutton weighing 6 or 7 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.

Average cost, 8d. per lb.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Shoulder of mutton may be dressed in a variety of ways; boiled, and served with onion
sauce; boned, and stuffed with a good veal forcemeat; or baked, with sliced potatoes in the
dripping-pan.

    THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD.--James Hogg was perhaps the most
    remarkable man that ever wore the maud of a shepherd. Under
    the garb, aspect, and bearing of a rude peasant (and rude enough
    he was in most of these things, even after no inconsiderable
    experience of society), the world soon discovered a true poet. If "the shepherd" of Professor Wilson's "Noctes
    Ambrosianae" may be taken as a true portrait of James Hogg, we
    must admit that, for quaintness of humour, the poet of Ettrick
    Forest had few rivals. Sir Walter Scott said that Hogg's
    thousand little touches of absurdity afforded him more
    entertainment than the best comedy that ever set the pit in a
    roar. Among the written productions of the shepherd-poet, is an
    account of his own experiences in sheep-tending, called "The
    Shepherd's Calender." This work contains a vast amount of useful
    information upon sheep, their diseases, habits, and management.
    The Ettrick Shepherd died in 1835.

SHEEP'S BRAINS, EN MATELOTE (an Entree).

740. INGREDIENTS.--6 sheep's brains, vinegar, salt, a few slices of bacon, 1 small onion, 2
cloves, a small bunch of parsley, sufficient stock or weak broth to cover the brains, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon-juice, matelote sauce, No. 512.

Mode.--Detach the brains from the heads without breaking them, and put them into a pan of warm
water; remove the skin, and let them remain for two hours. Have ready a saucepan of boiling
water, add a little vinegar and salt, and put in the brains. When they are quite firm, take
them out and put them into very cold water. Place 2 or 3 slices of bacon in a stewpan, put
in the brains, the onion stuck with 2 cloves, the parsley, and a good seasoning of pepper and
salt; cover with stock, or weak broth, and boil them gently for about 25 minutes. Have ready
some croûtons; arrange these in the dish alternately with the brains, and cover with a matelote
sauce, No. 512, to which has been added the above proportion of lemon-juice.

Time.--25 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

SHEEP'S FEET or TROTTERS (Soyer's Recipe).

741. INGREDIENTS.--12 feet, 1/4 lb. of beef or mutton suet, 2 onions, 1 carrot, 2 bay-leaves,
2 sprigs of thyme, 1 oz. of salt, 1/4 oz. of pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2-1/2 quarts
of water, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 3/4 teaspoonful
of pepper, a little grated nutmeg, the juice of 1 lemon, 1 gill of milk, the yolks of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Have the feet cleaned, and the long bone extracted from them. Put the suet into a stewpan,
with the onions and carrot sliced, the bay-leaves, thyme, salt, and pepper, and let these simmer
for 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and the water, and keep stirring till it boils;
then put in the feet. Let these simmer for 3 hours, or until perfectly tender, and take them
and lay them on a sieve. Mix together, on a plate, with the back of a spoon, butter, salt,
flour (1 teaspoonful), pepper, nutmeg, and lemon-juice as above, and put the feet, with a gill
of milk, into a stewpan. When very hot, add the butter, &c., and stir continually till melted.
Now mix the yolks of 2 eggs with 5 tablespoonfuls of milk; stir this to the other ingredients,
keep moving the pan over the fire continually for a minute or two, but do not allow it to boil
after the eggs are added. Serve in a very hot dish, and garnish with croûtons, or sippets of
toasted bread.

Time.--3 hours. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

TO DRESS A SHEEP'S HEAD.

742. INGREDIENTS.--1 sheep's head, sufficient water to cover it, 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 2 or
3 parsnips, 3 onions, a small bunch of parsley, 1 teaspoonful of pepper, 3 teaspoonfuls of
salt, 1/4 lb. of Scotch oatmeal.

Mode.--Clean the head well, and let it soak in warm water for 2 hours, to get rid of the blood;
put it into a saucepan, with sufficient cold water to cover it, and when it boils, add the
vegetables, peeled and sliced, and the remaining ingredients; before adding the oatmeal, mix
it to a smooth batter with a little of the liquor. Keep stirring till it boils up; then shut
the saucepan closely, and let it stew gently for 1-1/2 or 2 hours. It may be thickened with
rice or barley, but oatmeal is preferable.

Time.--1-1/2 or 2 hours. Average cost, 8d. each.

Sufficient for 3 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    SINGED SHEEP'S HEAD.--The village of Dudingston, which stands
    "within a mile of Edinburgh town," was formerly celebrated for
    this ancient and homely Scottish dish. In the summer months,
    many opulent citizens used to resort to this place to solace
    themselves over singed sheep's heads, boiled or baked. The sheep
    fed upon the neighbouring hills were slaughtered at this
    village, and the carcases were sent to town; but the heads were
    left to be consumed in the place. We are not aware whether the
    custom of eating sheep's heads at Dudingston is still kept up by
    the good folks of Edinburgh.

TOAD-IN-THE-HOLE (Cold Meat Cookery).

743. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of flour, 1 pint of milk, 3 eggs, butter, a few slices of cold mutton,
pepper and salt to taste, 2 kidneys.

Mode.--Make a smooth batter of flour, milk, and eggs in the above proportion; butter a baking-dish,
and pour in the batter. Into this place a few slices of cold mutton, previously well seasoned,
and the kidneys, which should be cut into rather small pieces; bake about 1 hour, or rather
longer, and send it to table in the dish it was baked in. Oysters or mushrooms may be substituted
for the kidneys, and will be found exceedingly good.

Seasonable at any time.

BREAST OF LAMB AND GREEN PEAS.

744. INGREDIENTS.--1 breast of lamb, a few slices of bacon, 1/4 pint of stock No. 105, 1 lemon,
1 onion, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, green peas.

Mode.--Remove the skin from a breast of lamb, put it into a saucepan of boiling water, and
let it simmer for 5 minutes. Take it out and lay it in cold water. Line the bottom of a stewpan
with a few thin slices of bacon; lay the lamb on these; peel the lemon, cut it into slices,
and put these on the meat, to keep it white and make it tender; cover with 1 or 2 more slices
of bacon; add the stock, onion, and herbs, and set it on a slow fire to simmer very gently
until tender. Have ready some green peas, put these on a dish, and place the lamb on the top
of these. The appearance of this dish may be much improved by glazing the lamb, and spinach
may be substituted for the peas when variety is desired.

Time.--1-1/2 hour. Average cost, 10d. per lb.

Sufficient for 3 persons.

Seasonable,--grass lamb, from Easter to Michaelmas.

    THE LAMB AS A SACRIFICE.--The number of lambs consumed in
    sacrifices by the Hebrews must have been very considerable. Two
    lambs "of the first year" were appointed to be sacrificed daily
    for the morning and evening sacrifice; and a lamb served as a
    substitute for the first-born of unclean animals, such as the
    ass, which could not be accepted as an offering to the Lord.
    Every year, also, on the anniversary of the deliverance of the
    children of Israel from the bondage of Egypt, every family was
    ordered to sacrifice a lamb or kid, and to sprinkle some of its
    blood upon the door-posts, in commemoration of the judgment of
    God upon the Egyptians. It was to be eaten roasted, with
    unleavened bread and bitter herbs, in haste, with the loins
    girded, the shoes on the feet, and the staff in the hand; and
    whatever remained until the morning was to be burnt. The sheep
    was also used in the numerous special, individual, and national
    sacrifices ordered by the Jewish law. On extraordinary
    occasions, vast quantities of sheep were sacrificed at once;
    thus Solomon, on the completion of the temple, offered "sheep
    and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude."

STEWED BREAST OF LAMB.

745. INGREDIENTS.--1 breast of lamb, pepper and salt to taste, sufficient stock, No. 105, to
cover it, 1 glass of sherry, thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Skin the lamb, cut it into pieces, and season them with pepper and salt; lay these in
a stewpan, pour in sufficient stock or gravy to cover them, and stew very gently until tender,
which will be in about 1-1/2 hour. Just before serving, thicken the sauce with a little butter
and flour; add the sherry, give one boil, and pour it over the meat.

746. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of lamb, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Trim off the flap from a fine loin of lamb, aid cut it into chops about 3/4 inch in
thickness. Have ready a bright clear fire; lay the chops on a gridiron, and broil them of a
nice pale brown, turning them when required. Season them with pepper and salt; serve very hot
and quickly, and garnish with crisped parsley, or place them on mashed potatoes. Asparagus,
spinach, or peas are the favourite accompaniments to lamb chops.

Seasonable from Easter to Michaelmas.

LAMB CUTLETS AND SPINACH (an Entree).

747. INGREDIENTS.--8 cutlets, egg and bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, a little clarified
butter.

Mode.--Cut the cutlets from a neck of lamb, and shape them by cutting off the thick part of
the chine-bone. Trim off most of the fat and all the skin, and scrape the top part of the bones
quite clean. Brush the cutlets over with egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and season with
pepper and salt. Now dip them into clarified butter, sprinkle over a few more bread crumbs,
and fry them over a sharp fire, turning them when required. Lay them before the fire to drain,
and arrange them on a dish with spinach in the centre, which should be previously well boiled,
drained, chopped, and seasoned.

Time.--About 7 or 8 minutes. Average cost, 10d. per lb.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable from Easter to Michaelmas.

Note.--Peas, asparagus, or French beans, may be substituted for the spinach; or lamb cutlets
may be served with stewed cucumbers, Soubise sauce, &c. &c.

LAMB'S FRY.

748. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of lamb's fry, 3 pints of water, egg and bread crumbs, 1 teaspoonful
of chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Boil the fry for 1/4 hour in the above proportion of water, take it out and dry it in
a cloth; grate some bread down finely, mix with it a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and a high
seasoning of pepper and salt. Brush the fry lightly over with the yolk of an egg, sprinkle
over the bread crumbs, and fry for 5 minutes. Serve very hot on a napkin in a dish, and garnish
with plenty of crisped parsley.

Time.-1 hour to simmer the fry, 5 minutes to fry it.

Average cost, 10d. per lb.

Sufficient for 2 or 3 persons.

Seasonable from Easter to Michaelmas.

HASHED LAMB AND BROILED BLADE-BONE.

749. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a cold shoulder of lamb, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz.
of butter, about 1/2 pint of stock or gravy, 1 tablespoonful of shalot vinegar, 3 or 4 pickled
gherkins.

Mode.--Take the blade-bone from the shoulder, and cut the meat into collops as neatly as possible.
Season the bone with pepper and salt, pour a little oiled butter over it, and place it in the
oven to warm through. Put the stock into a stewpan, add the ketchup and shalot vinegar, and
lay in the pieces of lamb. Let these heat gradually through, but do not allow them to boil.
Take the blade-bone out of the oven, and place it on a gridiron over a sharp fire to brown.
Slice the gherkins, put them into the hash, and dish it with the blade-bone in the centre.
It may be garnished with croutons or sippets of toasted bread.

ROAST FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.

750. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb, a little salt.

Mode.--To obtain the flavour of lamb in perfection, it should not be long kept; time to cool
is all that it requires; and though the meat may be somewhat thready, the juices and flavour
will be infinitely superior to that of lamb that has been killed 2 or 3 days. Make up the fire
in good time, that it may be clear and brisk when the joint is put down. Place it at a sufficient
distance to prevent the fat from burning, and baste it constantly till the moment of serving.
Lamb should be very thoroughly done without being dried up, and not the slightest appearance
of red gravy should be visible, as in roast mutton: this rule is applicable to all young white
meats. Serve with a little gravy made in the dripping-pan, the same as for other roasts, and
send to table with it a tureen of mint sauce, No. 469, and a fresh salad. A cut lemon, a small
piece of fresh butter, and a little cayenne, should also be placed on the table, so that when
the carver separates the shoulder from the ribs, they may be ready for his use; if, however,
he should not be very expert, we would recommend that the cook should divide these joints nicely
before coming to table.

Time.--Fore-quarter of lamb weighing 10 lbs., 1-3/4 to 2 hours.

Average cost, 10d. to 1s. per lb. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable,--grass lamb, from Easter to Michaelmas.

BOILED LEG OF LAMB A LA BECHAMEL.

751. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of lamb, Béchamel sauce, No. 367.

Mode.--Do not choose a very large joint, but one weighing about 5 lbs. Have ready a saucepan
of boiling water, into which plunge the lamb, and when it boils up again, draw it to the side
of the fire, and let the water cool a little. Then stew very gently for about 1-1/4 hour, reckoning
from the time that the water begins to simmer. Make some Béchamel by recipe No. 367, dish the
lamb, pour the sauce over it, and garnish with tufts of boiled cauliflower or carrots. When
liked, melted butter may be substituted for the Béchamel: this is a more simple method, but
not nearly so nice. Send to table with it some of the sauce in a tureen, and boiled cauliflowers
or spinach, with whichever vegetable the dish is garnished.

Time.--1-1/4 hour after the water simmers.

Average cost, 10d. to 1s. per lb. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from Easter to Michaelmas.

ROAST LEG OF LAMB.

752. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb, a little salt.

Mode.--Place the joint at a good distance from the fire at first, and baste well the whole
time it is cooking. When nearly done, draw it nearer the fire to acquire a nice brown colour.
Serve with mint sauce and a fresh salad, and for vegetables send peas, spinach, or cauliflowers
to table with it.

Time.--A leg of lamb weighing 5 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.

BRAISED LOIN OF LAMB.

753. INGREDIENTS.--1 loin of lamb, a few slices of bacon, 1 bunch of green onions, 5 or 6 young
carrots, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 pint of stock, salt to taste.

Mode.--Bone a loin of lamb, and line the bottom of a stewpan just capable of holding it, with
a few thin slices of fat bacon; add the remaining ingredients, cover the meat with a few more
slices of bacon, pour in the stock, and simmer very gently for 2 hours; take it up, dry it,
strain and reduce the gravy to a glaze, with which glaze the meat, and serve it either on stewed
peas, spinach, or stewed cucumbers.

Time.--2 hours.

754. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb; a little salt.

Mode.--This joint is now very much in vogue, and is generally considered a nice one for a small
party. Have ready a clear brisk fire; put down the joint at a little distance, to prevent the
fat from scorching, and keep it well basted all the time it is cooking. Serve with mint sauce
and a fresh salad, and send to table with it, either peas, cauliflowers, or spinach.

Seasonable from Easter to Michaelmas.

Note.--Loin and ribs of lamb are roasted in the same manner, and served with the same sauces
as the above. A loin will take about 1-1/4 hour; ribs, from 1 to 1-1/4 hour.

ROAST SHOULDER OF LAMB.

755. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb; a little salt.

Mode.--Have ready a clear brisk fire, and put down the joint at a sufficient distance from
it, that the fat may not burn. Keep constantly basting until done, and serve with a little
gravy made in the dripping-pan, and send mint sauce to table with it. Peas, spinach, or cauliflowers
are the usual vegetables served with lamb, and also a fresh salad.

Time.--A shoulder of lamb rather more than 1 hour.

SHOULDER OF LAMB STUFFED.

756. INGREDIENTS.--Shoulder of lamb, forcemeat No. 417, trimmings of veal or beef, 2 onions,
1/2 head of celery, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 quart of stock No. 105.

Mode.--Take the blade-bone out of a shoulder of lamb, fill up its place with forcemeat, and
sew it up with coarse thread. Put it into a stewpan with a few slices of bacon under and over
the lamb, and add the remaining ingredients. Stew very gently for rather more than 2 hours.
Reduce the gravy, with which glaze the meat, and serve with peas, stewed cucumbers, or sorrel
sauce.

LAMB'S SWEETBREADS, LARDED, AND ASPARAGUS (an Entree).

757. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 sweetbreads, 1/2 pint of veal stock, white pepper and salt to taste,
a small bunch of green onions, 1 blade of pounded mace, thickening of butter and flour, 2 eggs,
nearly 1/2 pint of cream, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, a very little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Soak the sweetbreads in lukewarm water, and put them into a saucepan with sufficient
boiling water to cover them, and let them simmer for 10 minutes; then take them out and put
them into cold water. Now lard them, lay them in a stewpan, add the stock, seasoning, onions,
mace, and a thickening of butter and flour, and stew gently for 1/4 hour or 20 minutes. Beat
up the egg with the cream, to which add the minced parsley and a very little grated nutmeg.
Put this to the other ingredients; stir it well till quite hot, but do not let it boil after
the cream is added, or it will curdle. 6d. to 3s. 6d. each.

Sufficient--3 sweetbreads for 1 entrée.

Seasonable from Easter to Michaelmas.

ANOTHER WAY TO DRESS SWEETBREADS (an Entree).

758. INGREDIENTS.--Sweetbreads, egg and bread crumbs, 1/2 pint of gravy, No. 442, 1/2 glass
of sherry.

Mode.--Soak the sweetbreads in water for an hour, and throw them into boiling water to render
them firm. Let them stew gently for about 1/4 hour, take them out and put them into a cloth
to drain all the water from them. Brush them over with egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs,
and either brown them in the oven or before the fire. Have ready the above quantity of gravy,
to which add 1/2 glass of sherry; dish the sweetbreads, pour the gravy under them, and garnish
with water-cresses.

MUTTON AND LAMB CARVING.

HAUNCH OF MUTTON.

759. A deep cut should, in the first place, be made quite down to the bone, across the knuckle-end
of the joint, along the line 1 to 2. This will let the gravy escape; and then it should be
carved, in not too of the haunch, in the direction of the line from 4 to 3.

LEG OF MUTTON.

760. This homely, but capital English joint, is almost invariably served at table as shown
in the engraving. The carving of it is not very difficult: the knife should be carried sharply
down in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, and slices taken from either side, as the guests
may desire, some liking the knuckle-end, as well done, and others preferring the more underdone
part. The fat should be sought near the line 3 to 4. Some connoisseurs are fond of having this
joint dished with the under-side uppermost, so as to get at the finely-grained meat lying under
that part of the meat, known as the Pope's eye; but this is an extravagant fashion, and one
that will hardly find favour in the eyes of many economical British housewives and housekeepers.

LOIN OF MUTTON.

761. There is one point in connection with carving a loin of mutton which includes every other;
that is, that the joint should be thoroughly well jointed by the butcher before it is cooked.
This knack of jointing requires practice and the proper tools; and no one but the butcher is
supposed to have these. If the bones be not well jointed, the carving of a loin of mutton is
not a gracious business; whereas, if that has been attended to, it is an easy and untroublesome
task. The knife should be inserted at fig. 1, and after feeling your way between the bones,
it should be carried sharply in the direction of the line 1 to 2. As there are some people
who prefer the outside cut, while others do not like it, the question as to their choice of
this should be asked.

SADDLE OF MUTTON.

762. Although we have heard, at various intervals, growlings expressed at the inevitable "saddle
of mutton" at the dinner-parties of our middle classes, yet we doubt whether any other joint
is better liked, when it has been well hung and artistically cooked. There is a diversity of
opinion respecting the mode of sending this joint to table; but it has only reference to whether
or no there shall be any portion of the tail, or, if so, how many joints of the tail. We ourselves
prefer the mode as shown in our coloured illustration "O;" but others may, upon equally good
grounds, like the way shown in the engraving on this page. Some trim the tail with a paper
frill. The carving is not difficult: it is usually cut in the direction of the line from 2
to 1, quite down to the bones, in evenly-sliced pieces. A fashion, however, patronized by some,
is to carve it obliquely, in the direction of the line from 4 to 3; in which case the joint
would be turned round the other way, having the tail end on the right of the carver.

SHOULDER OF MUTTON.

763. This is a joint not difficult to carve. The knife should be drawn from the outer edge
of the shoulder in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, until the bone of the shoulder is
reached. As many slices as can be carved in this manner should be taken, and afterwards the
meat lying on either side of the blade-bone should be served, by carving in the direction of
3 to 4 and 3 to 4. The uppermost side of the shoulder being now finished, the joint should
be turned, and slices taken off along its whole length. There are some who prefer this under-side
of the shoulder for its juicy flesh, although the grain of the meat is not so fine as that
on the other side.

FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.

764. We always think that a good and practised carver delights in the manipulation of this
joint, for there is a little field for his judgment and dexterity which does not always occur.
The separation of the shoulder from the breast is the first point to be attended to; this is
done by passing the knife lightly round the dotted line, as shown by the figures 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5, so as to cut through the skin, and then, by raising with a little force the shoulder,
into which the fork should be firmly fixed, it will come away with just a little more exercise
of the knife. In dividing the shoulder and breast, the carver should take care not to cut away
too much of the meat from the latter, as that would rather spoil its appearance when the shoulder
is removed. The breast and shoulder being separated, it is usual to lay a small piece of butter,
and sprinkle a little cayenne, lemon-juice, and salt between them; and when this is melted
and incorporated with the meat and gravy, the shoulder may, as more convenient, be removed
into another dish. The, next operation is to separate the ribs from the brisket, by cutting
through the meat on the line 5 to 6. The joint is then ready to be served to the guests; the
ribs being carved in the direction of the lines from 9 to 10, and the brisket from 7 to 8.
The carver should ask those at the table what parts they prefer-ribs, brisket, or a piece of
the shoulder.

LEG OF LAMB, LOIN OF LAMB, SADDLE OF LAMB, SHOULDER OF LAMB,

are carved in the same manner as the corresponding joints of mutton. (See Nos. 760, 761, 762, 763.)

CHAPTER XVI.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COMMON HOG.

765. THE HOG belongs to the order Mammalia, the genus Sus scrofa, and the species Pachydermata,
or thick-skinned; and its generic characters are, a small head, with long flexible snout truncated;
42 teeth, divided into 4 upper incisors, converging, 6 lower incisors, projecting, 2 upper
and 2 lower canine, or tusks,--the former short, the latter projecting, formidable, and sharp,
and 14 molars in each jaw; cloven feet furnished with 4 toes, and tail, small, short, and twisted;
while, in some varieties, this appendage is altogether wanting.

766. FROM THE NUMBER AND POSITION OF THE TEETH, physiologists are enabled to define the nature
and functions of the animal; and from those of the Sus, or hog, it is evident that he is as
much a grinder as a biter, or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food; though a mixture
of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most conducive to the integrity and health
of its physical system.

767. THUS THE PIG TRIBE, though not a ruminating mammal, as might be inferred from the number
of its molar teeth, is yet a link between the herbivorous and the carnivorous tribes, and is
consequently what is known as an omnivorous quadruped; or, in other words, capable of converting
any kind of aliment into nutriment.

768. THOUGH THE HOOF IN THE HOG is, as a general rule, cloven, there are several remarkable
exceptions, as in the species native to Norway, Illyria, Sardinia, and formerly to the Berkshire
variety of the British domesticated pig, in which the hoof is entire and uncleft.

769. WHATEVER DIFFERENCE IN ITS PHYSICAL NATURE, climate and soil may produce in this animal,
his functional characteristics are the same in whatever part of the world he may be found;
and whether in the trackless forests of South America, the coral isles of Polynesia, the jungles
of India, or the spicy brakes of Sumatra, he is everywhere known for his gluttony, laziness,
and indifference to the character and quality of his food. And though he occasionally shows
an epicure's relish for a succulent plant or a luscious carrot, which he will discuss with
all his salivary organs keenly excited, he will, the next moment, turn with equal gusto to
some carrion offal that might excite the forbearance of the unscrupulous cormorant. It is this
coarse and repulsive mode of feeding that has, in every country and language, obtained for
him the opprobrium of being "an unclean animal."

770. IN THE MOSAICAL LAW, the pig is condemned as an unclean beast, and consequently interdicted
to the Israelites, as unfit for human food. "And the swine, though he divideth the hoof and
be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud. He is unclean to you."--Lev. xi. 7. Strict, however,
as the law was respecting the cud-chewing and hoof-divided animals, the Jews, with their usual
perversity and violation of the divine commands, seem afterwards to have ignored the prohibition;
for, unless they ate pork, it is difficult to conceive for what purpose they kept troves of
swine, as from the circumstance recorded in Matthew xviii. 32, when Jesus was in Galilee, and
the devils, cast out of the two men, were permitted to enter the herd of swine that were feeding
on the hills in the neighbourhood of the Sea of Tiberias, it is very evident they did. There
is only one interpretation by which we can account for a prohibition that debarred the Jews
from so many foods which we regard as nutritious luxuries, that, being fat and the texture
more hard of digestion than other meats, they were likely, in a hot dry climate, where vigorous
exercise could seldom be taken, to produce disease, and especially cutaneous affections; indeed,
in this light, as a code of sanitary ethics, the book of Leviticus is the most admirable system
of moral government ever conceived for man's benefit.

771. SETTING HIS COARSE FEEDING AND SLOVENLY HABITS OUT OF THE QUESTION, there is no domestic
animal so profitable or so useful to man as the much-maligned pig, or any that yields him a
more varied or more luxurious repast. The prolific powers of the pig are extraordinary, even
under the restraint of domestication; but when left to run wild in favourable situations, as
in the islands of the South Pacific, the result, in a few years, from two animals put on shore
and left undisturbed, is truly surprising; for they breed so fast, and have such numerous litters,
that unless killed off in vast numbers both for the use of the inhabitants and as fresh provisions
for ships' crews, they would degenerate into vermin. In this country the pig has usually two
litters, or farrows, in a year, the breeding seasons being April and October; and the period
the female goes with her young is about four months,--16 weeks or 122 days. The number produced
at each litter depends upon the character of the breed; 12 being the average number in the
small variety, and 10 in the large; in the mixed breeds, however, the average is between 10
and 15, and in some instances has reached as many as 20. But however few, or however many,
young pigs there may be to the farrow, there is always one who is the dwarf of the family circle,
a poor, little, shrivelled, half-starved anatomy, with a small melancholy voice, a staggering
gait, a woe-begone countenance, and a thread of a tail, whose existence the complacent mother
ignores, his plethoric brothers and sisters repudiate, and for whose emaciated jaws there is
never a spare or supplemental teat, till one of the favoured gormandizers, overtaken by momentary
oblivion, drops the lacteal fountain, and gives the little squeaking straggler the chance of
a momentary mouthful. This miserable little object, which may be seen bringing up the rear
of every litter, is called the Tony pig, or the Anthony; so named, it is presumed, from being
the one always assigned to the Church, when tithe was taken in kind; and as St. Anthony was
the patron of husbandry, his name was given in a sort of bitter derision to the starveling
that constituted his dues; for whether there are ten or fifteen farrows to the litter, the
Anthony is always the last of the family to come into the world.

772. FROM THE GROSSNESS OF HIS FEEDING, the large amount of aliment he consumes, his gluttonous
way of eating it, from his slothful habits, laziness, and indulgence in sleep, the pig is particularly
liable to disease, and especially indigestion, heartburn, and affections of the skin.

773. TO COUNTERACT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A VIOLATION OF THE PHYSICAL LAWS, a powerful monitor
in the brain of the pig teaches him to seek for relief and medicine. To open the pores of his
skin, blocked up with mud, and excite perspiration, he resorts to a tree, a stump, or his trough--anything
rough and angular, and using it as a curry-comb to his body, obtains the luxury of a scratch
and the benefit of cuticular evaporation; he next proceeds with his long supple snout to grub
up antiscorbutic roots, cooling salads of mallow and dandelion, and, greatest treat of all,
he stumbles on a piece of chalk or a mouthful of delicious cinder, which, he knows by instinct,
is the most sovereign remedy in the world for that hot, unpleasant sensation he has had all
the morning at his stomach.

774. IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT that, though every one who keeps a pig knows how prone he is to
disease, how that disease injures the quality of the meat, and how eagerly he pounces on a
bit of coal or cinder, or any coarse dry substance that will adulterate the rich food on which
he lives, and by affording soda to his system, correct the vitiated fluids of his body,--yet
very few have the judgment to act on what they see, and by supplying the pig with a few shovelfuls
of cinders in his sty, save the necessity of his rooting for what is so needful to his health.
Instead of this, however, and without supplying the animal with what its instinct craves for,
his nostril is bored with a red-hot iron, and a ring clinched in his nose to prevent rooting
for what he feels to be absolutely necessary for his health; and ignoring the fact that, in
a domestic state at least, the pig lives on the richest of all food,--scraps of cooked animal
substances, boiled vegetables, bread, and other items, given in that concentrated essence of
aliment for a quadruped called wash, and that he eats to repletion, takes no exercise, and
finally sleeps all the twenty-four hours he is not eating, and then, when the animal at last
seeks for those medicinal aids which would obviate the evil of such a forcing diet, his keeper,
instead of meeting his animal instinct by human reason, and giving him what he seeks, has the
inhumanity to torture him by a ring, that, keeping up a perpetual "raw" in the pig's snout,
prevents his digging for those corrective drugs which would remove the evils of his artificial
existence.

775. THOUGH SUBJECT TO SO MANY DISEASES, no domestic animal is more easily kept in health,
cleanliness, and comfort, and this without the necessity of "ringing," or any excessive desire
of the hog to roam, break through his sty, or plough up his pound. Whatever the kind of food
may be on which the pig is being fed or fattened, a teaspoonful or more of salt should always
be given in his mess of food, and a little heap of well-burnt cinders, with occasional bits
of chalk, should always be kept by the side of his trough, as well as a vessel of clean water:
his pound, or the front part of his sty, should be totally free from straw, the brick flooring
being every day swept out and sprinkled with a layer of sand. His lair, or sleeping apartment,
should be well sheltered by roof and sides from cold, wet, and all changes of weather, and
the bed made up of a good supply of clean straw, sufficiently deep to enable the pig to burrow
his unprotected body beneath it. All the refuse of the garden, in the shape of roots, leaves,
and stalks, should be placed in a corner of his pound or feeding-chamber, for the delectation
of his leisure moments; and once a week, on the family washing-day, a pail of warm soap-suds
should be taken into his sty, and, by means of a scrubbing-brush and soap, his back, shoulders,
and flanks should be well cleaned, a pail of clean warm water being thrown over his body at
the conclusion, before he is allowed to retreat to his clean straw to dry himself. By this
means, the excessive nutrition of his aliment will be corrected, a more perfect digestion insured,
and, by opening the pores of the skin, a more vigorous state of health acquired than could
have been obtained under any other system.

776. WE HAVE ALREADY SAID that no other animal yields man so many kinds and varieties of luxurious
food as is supplied to him by the flesh of the hog differently prepared; for almost every part
of the animal, either fresh, salted, or dried, is used for food; and even those viscera not
so employed are of the utmost utility in a domestic point of view.

777. THOUGH DESTITUTE OF THE HIDE, HORNS, AND HOOFS, constituting the offal of most domestic
animals, the pig is not behind the other mammalia in its usefulness to man. Its skin, especially
that of the boar, from its extreme closeness of texture, when tanned, is employed for the seats
of saddles, to cover powder, shot, and drinking-flasks; and the hair, according to its colour,
flexibility, and stubbornness, is manufactured into tooth, nail, and hairbrushes,--others into
hat, clothes, and shoe-brushes; while the longer and finer qualities are made into long and
short brooms and painters' brushes; and a still more rigid description, under the name of "bristles,"
are used by the shoemaker as needles for the passage of his wax-end. Besides so many benefits
and useful services conferred on man by this valuable animal, his fat, in a commercial sense,
is quite as important as his flesh, and brings a price equal to the best joints in the carcase.
This fat is rendered, or melted out of the caul, or membrane in which it is contained, by boiling
water, and, while liquid, run into prepared bladders, when, under the name of lard, it becomes
an article of extensive trade and value.

778. OF THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF THE DOMESTICATED HOG, the following list of breeds may be
accepted as the best, presenting severally all those qualities aimed at in the rearing of domestic
stock, as affecting both the breeder and the consumer. Native--Berkshire, Essex, York, and
Cumberland; Foreign--the Chinese. Before, however, proceeding with the consideration of the
different orders, in the series we have placed them, it will be necessary to make a few remarks
relative to the pig generally. In the first place, the Black Pig is regarded by breeders as
the best and most eligible animal, not only from the fineness and delicacy of the skin, but
because it is less affected by the heat in summer, and far less subject to cuticular disease
than either the white or brindled hog, but more particularly from its kindlier nature and greater
aptitude to fatten.

779. THE GREAT QUALITY FIRST SOUGHT FOR IN A HOG is a capacious stomach, and next, a healthy
power of digestion; for the greater the quantity he can eat, and the more rapidly he can digest
what he has eaten, the more quickly will he fatten; and the faster he can be made to increase
in flesh, without a material increase of bone, the better is the breed considered, and the
more valuable the animal. In the usual order of nature, the development of flesh and enlargement
of bone proceed together; but here the object is to outstrip the growth of the bones by the
quicker development of their fleshy covering.

780. THE CHIEF POINTS SOUGHT FOR IN THE CHOICE OF A HOG are breadth of chest, depth of carcase,
width of loin, chine, and ribs, compactness of form, docility, cheerfulness, and general beauty
of appearance. The head in a well-bred hog must not be too long, the forehead narrow and convex,
cheeks full, snout fine, mouth small, eyes small and quick, ears short, thin, and sharp, pendulous,
and pointing forwards; neck full and broad, particularly on the top, where it should join very
broad shoulders; the ribs, loin, and haunch should be in a uniform line, and the tail well
set, neither too high nor too low; at the same time the back is to be straight or slightly
curved, the chest deep, broad, and prominent, the legs short and thick; the belly, when well
fattened, should nearly touch the ground, the hair be long, thin, fine, and having few bristles,
and whatever the colour, uniform, either white, black, or blue; but not spotted, speckled,
brindled, or sandy. Such are the features and requisites that, among breeders and judges, constitute
the beau idéal of a perfect pig.

781. THE BERKSHIRE PIG IS THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST ESTEEMED of all our English domestic breeds,
and so highly is it regarded, that even the varieties of the stock are in as great estimation
as the parent breed itself. The characteristics of the Berkshire hog are that it has a tawny
colour, spotted with black, large ears hanging over the eyes, a thick, close, and well-made
body, legs short and small in the bone; feeds up to a great weight, fattens quickly, and is
good either for pork or bacon. The New or Improved Berkshire possesses all the above qualities,
but is infinitely more prone to fatten, while the objectionable colour has been entirely done
away with, being now either all white or completely black.

782. NEXT TO THE FORMER, THE ESSEX takes place in public estimation, always competing, and
often successfully, with the Berkshire. The peculiar characters of the Essex breed are that
it is tip-eared, has a long sharp head, is roach-backed, with a long flat body, standing high
on the legs; is rather bare of hair, is a quick feeder, has an enormous capacity of stomach
and belly, and an appetite to match its receiving capability. Its colour is white, or else
black and white, and it has a restless habit and an unquiet disposition. The present valuable
stock has sprung from a cross between the common native animal and either the White Chinese
or Black Neapolitan breeds.

783. THE YORKSHIRE, CALLED ALSO THE OLD LINCOLNSHIRE, was at one time the largest stock of
the pig family in England, and perhaps, at that time, the worst. It was long-legged, weak in
the loins, with coarse white curly hair, and flabby flesh. Now, however, it has undergone as
great a change as any breed in the kingdom, and by judicious crossing has become the most valuable
we possess, being a very well-formed pig throughout, with a good head, a pleasant docile countenance,
with moderate-sized drooping ears, a broad back, slightly curved, large chine and loins, with
deep sides, full chest, and well covered with long thickly-set white hairs. Besides these qualities
of form, he is a quick grower, feeds fast, and will easily make from 20 to 25 stone before
completing his first year. The quality of the meat is also uncommonly good, the fat and lean
being laid on in almost equal proportions. So capable is this species of development, both
in flesh and stature, that examples of the Yorkshire breed have been exhibited weighing as
much as a Scotch ox.

784. THOUGH ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN ENGLAND can boast some local variety or other of this useful
animal, obtained from the native stock by crossing with some of the foreign kinds, Cumberland
and the north-west parts of the kingdom have been celebrated for a small breed of white pigs,
with a thick, compact, and well-made body, short in the legs, the head and back well formed,
ears slouching and a little downwards, and on the whole, a hardy, profitable animal, and one
well disposed to fatten.

785. THERE IS NO VARIETY OF THIS USEFUL ANIMAL that presents such peculiar features as the
species known to us as the Chinese pig; and as it is the general belief that to this animal
and the Neapolitan hog we are indebted for that remarkable improvement which has taken place
in the breeds of the English pig, it is necessary to be minute in the description of this,
in all respects, singular animal. The Chinese, in the first place, consists of many varieties,
and presents as many forms of body as differences of colour; the best kind, however, has a
beautiful white skin of singular thinness and delicacy; the hair too is perfectly white, and
thinly set over the body, with here and there a few bristles. He has a broad snout, short head,
eyes bright and fiery, very small fine pink ears, wide cheeks, high chine, with a neck of such
immense thickness, that when the animal is fat it looks like an elongated carcase,--a mass
of fat, without shape or form, like a feather pillow. The belly is dependent, and almost trailing
on the ground, the legs very short, and the tail so small as to be little more than a rudiment.
It has a ravenous appetite, and will eat anything that the wonderful assimilating powers of
its stomach can digest; and to that capability, there seems no limit in the whole range of
animal or vegetable nature. The consequence of this perfect and singularly rapid digestion
is an unprecedented proneness to obesity, a process of fattening that, once commenced, goes
on with such rapid development, that, in a short time, it loses all form, depositing such an
amount of fat, that it in fact ceases to have any refuse part or offal, and, beyond the hair
on its back and the callous extremity of the snout, the whole carcase is eatable.

786. WHEN JUDICIOUSLY FED ON VEGETABLE DIET, and this obese tendency checked, the flesh of
the Chinese pig is extremely delicate and delicious; but when left to gorge almost exclusively
on animal food, it becomes oily, coarse, and unpleasant. Perhaps there is no other instance
in nature where the effect of rapid and perfect digestion is so well shown as in this animal,
which thrives on everything, and turns to the benefit of its physical economy, food of the
most opposite nature, and of the most unwholesome and offensive character. When fully fattened,
the thin cuticle, that is one of its characteristics, cracks, from the adipose distension beneath,
exposing the fatty mass, which discharges a liquid oil from the adjacent tissues. The great
fault in this breed is the remarkably small quantity of lean laid down, to the immense proportion
of fat. Some idea of the growth of this species may be inferred from the fact of their attaining
to 18 stone before two years, and when further advanced, as much as 40 stone. In its pure state,
except for roasters, the Chinese pig is too disproportionate for the English market; but when
crossed with some of our lean stock, the breed becomes almost invaluable.

787. THE WILD BOAR is a much more cleanly and sagacious animal than the domesticated hog; he
is longer in the snout, has his ears shorter and his tusks considerably longer, very frequently
measuring as much as 10 inches. They are extremely sharp, and are bent in an upward circle.
Unlike his domestic brother, who roots up here and there, or wherever his fancy takes, the
wild boar ploughs the ground in continuous lines or furrows. The boar, when selected as the
parent of a stock, should have a small head, be deep and broad in the chest; the chine should
be arched, the ribs and barrel well rounded, with the haunches falling full down nearly to
the hock; and he should always be more compact and smaller than the female. The colour of the
wild boar is always of a uniform hue, and generally of an iron grey; shading off into a black.
The hair of the boar is of considerable length, especially about the head and mane; he stands,
in general, from 20 to 30 inches in height at the shoulders, though instances have occurred
where he has reached 42 inches. The young are of a pale yellowish tint, irregularly brindled
with light brown. The boar of Germany is a large and formidable animal, and the hunting of
him, with a small species of mastiff, is still a national sport. From living almost exclusively
on acorns and nuts, his flesh is held in great esteem, and in Westphalia his legs are made
into hams by a process which, it is said, enhances the flavour and quality of the meat in a
remarkable degree.

788. THERE ARE TWO POINTS to be taken into consideration by all breeders of pigs--to what ultimate
use is the flesh to be put; for, if meant to be eaten fresh, or simply salted, the small breed
of pigs is host suited for the purpose; if for hams or bacon, the large variety of the animal
is necessary. Pigs are usually weaned between six and eight weeks after birth, after which
they are fed on soft food, such as mashed potatoes in skimmed or butter-milk. The general period
at which the small hogs are killed for the market is from 12 to 16 weeks; from 4 to 5 mouths,
they are called store pigs, and are turned out to graze till the animal has acquired its full
stature. As soon as this point has been reached, the pig should be forced to maturity as quickly
as possible; he should therefore be taken from the fields and farm-yard, and shut up on boiled
potatoes, buttermilk, and peas-meal, after a time to be followed by grains, oil-cake, wash,
barley, and Indian meal; supplying his sty at the same time with plenty of water, cinders,
and a quantity of salt in every mess of food presented to him.

789. THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PIGS IN GREAT BRITAIN is supposed to exceed 20 millions; and,
considering the third of the number as worth £2 apiece, and the remaining two-thirds as of
the relative value of 10s. each, would give a marketable estimate of over £20,000,000 for this
animal alone.

790. THE BEST AND MOST HUMANE MODE OF KILLING ALL LARGE HOGS is to strike them down like a
bullock, with the pointed end of a poleaxe, on the forehead, which has the effect of killing
the animal at once; all the butcher has then to do, is to open the aorta and great arteries,
and laying the animal's neck over a trough, let out the blood as quickly as possible. The carcase
is then to be scalded, either on a board or by immersion in a tub of very hot water, and all
the hair and dirt rapidly scraped off, till the skin is made perfectly white, when it is hung
up, opened, and dressed, as it is called, in the usual way. It is then allowed to cool, a sheet
being thrown around the carcase, to prevent the air from discolouring the newly-cleaned skin.
When meant for bacon, the hair is singed instead of being scalded off.

791. IN THE COUNTRY, where for ordinary consumption the pork killed for sale is usually both
larger and fatter than that supplied to the London consumer, it is customary to remove the
skin and fat down to the lean, and, salting that, roast what remains of the joint. Pork goes
further, and is consequently a more economical food than other meats, simply because the texture
is closer, and there is less waste in the cooking, either in roasting or boiling.

792. IN FRESH PORK, the leg is the most economical family joint, and the loin the richest.

793. COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING, very little difference exists between the weight of the live and
dead pig, and this, simply because there is neither the head nor the hide to be removed. It
has been proved that pork loses in cooking 13-1/2, per cent. of its weight. A salted hand weighing
4 lbs. 5 oz. lost in the cooking 11 oz.; after cooking, the meat weighing only 3 lbs. 1 oz.,
and the bone 9 oz. The original cost was 7-1/2d. a pound; but by this deduction, the cost rose
to 9d. per pound with the bone, and 10-1/4d. without it.

794. PORK, TO BE PRESERVED, is cured in several ways,--either by covering it with salt, or
immersing it in ready-made brine, where it is kept till required; or it is only partially salted,
and then hung up to dry, when the meat is called white bacon; or, after salting, it is hung
in wood smoke till the flesh is impregnated with the aroma from the wood. The Wiltshire bacon,
which is regarded as the finest in the kingdom, is prepared by laying the sides of a hog in
large wooden troughs, and then rubbing into the flesh quantities of powdered bay-salt, made
hot in a frying-pan. This process is repeated for four days; they are then left for three weeks,
merely turning the flitches every other day. After that time they are hung up to dry. The hogs
usually killed for purposes of bacon in England average from 18 to 20 stone; on the other hand,
the hogs killed in the country for farm-house purposes, seldom weigh less than 26 stone. The
legs of boars, hogs, and, in Germany, those of bears, are prepared differently, and called hams.

795. THE PRACTICE IN VOGUE FORMERLY in this country was to cut out the hams and cure them separately;
then to remove the ribs, which were roasted as "spare-ribs," and, curing the remainder of the
side, call it a "gammon of bacon."

Small pork to cut for table in joints, is cut up, in most places throughout the kingdom, as
represented in the engraving. The sale is divided with nine ribs to the fore quarter; and the
following is an enumeration of the joints in the two respective quarters:--

                 1. The leg.
  HIND QUARTER   2. The loin.
                 3. The spring, or belly.

                 4. The hand.
  FORE QUARTER   5. The fore-loin.
                 6. The cheek.

The weight of the several joints of a good pork pig of four stone may be as follows; viz.:--

  The leg                        8 lbs.
  The loin and spring            7 lbs.
  The hand                       6 lbs.
  The chine                      7 lbs.
  The cheek            from 2 to 3 lbs.

Of a bacon pig, the legs are reserved for curing, and when cured are called hams: when the
meat is separated from the shoulder-blade and bones and cured, it is called bacon. The bones,
with part of the meat left on them, are divided into spare-ribs, griskins, and chines.

PORK CUTLETS (Cold Meat Cookery).

796. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast loin of pork, 1 oz. of butter, 2 onions, 1 dessertspoonful
of flour, 1/2 pint of gravy, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar and mustard.

Mode.--Cut the pork into nice-sized cutlets, trim off most of the fat, and chop the onions.
Put the butter into a stewpan, lay in the cutlets and chopped onions, and fry a light brown;
then add the remaining ingredients, simmer gently for 5 or 7 minutes, and serve.

Seasonable from October to March.

    AUSTRIAN METHOD OF HERDING PIGS.--In the Austrian empire there
    are great numbers of wild swine, while, among the wandering
    tribes peopling the interior of Hungary, and spreading over the
    vast steppes of that country, droves of swine form a great
    portion of the wealth of the people, who chiefly live on a
    coarse bread and wind-dried bacon.

    In German Switzerland, the Tyrol, and other mountainous
    districts of continental Europe, though the inhabitants, almost
    everywhere, as in England, keep one or more pigs, they are at
    little or no trouble in feeding them, one or more men being
    employed by one or several villages as swine-herds; who, at a
    certain hour, every morning, call for the pig or pigs, and
    driving them to their feeding-grounds on the mountain-side and
    in the wood, take custody of the herd till, on the approach of
    night, they are collected into a compact body and driven home
    for a night's repose in their several sties.

    The amount of intelligence and docility displayed by the pigs in
    these mountain regions, is much more considerable than that
    usually allowed to this animal, and the manner in which these
    immense herds of swine are collected, and again distributed,
    without an accident or mistake, is a sight both curious and
    interesting; for it is all done without the assistance of a dog,
    or the aid even of the human voice, and solely by the crack of
    the long-lashed and heavily-loaded whip, which the swine-herd
    carries, and cracks much after the fashion of the French
    postilion; and which, though he frequently cracks, waking a
    hundred sharp echoes from the woods and rocks, he seldom has to
    use correctionally; the animal soon acquiring a thorough
    knowledge of the meaning of each crack; and once having felt its
    leaded thong, a lasting remembrance of its power. At early dawn,
    the swine-herd takes his stand at the outskirts of the first
    village, and begins flourishing through the misty air his
    immensely long lash, keeping a sort of rude time with the crack,
    crack, crack, crack, crack, crack of his whip. The nearest pigs,
    hearing the well-remembered sound, rouse from their straw, and
    rush from their sties into the road, followed by all their
    litters. As soon as a sufficient number are collected, the drove
    is set in motion, receiving, right and left, as they advance,
    fresh numbers; whole communities, or solitary individuals,
    streaming in from all quarters, and taking their place, without
    distinction, in the general herd; and, as if conscious where
    their breakfast lay, without wasting a moment on idle
    investigation, all eagerly push on to the mountains. In this
    manner village after village is collected, till the drove not
    unfrequently consists of several thousands. The feeding-ground
    has, of course, often to be changed, and the drove have
    sometimes to be driven many miles, and to a considerable height
    up the mountain, before the whip gives the signal for the
    dispersion of the body and the order to feed, when the herdsman
    proceeds to form himself a shelter, and look after his own
    comfort for the rest of the day. As soon as twilight sets in,
    the whip is again heard echoing the signal for muster; and in
    the same order in which they were collected, the swine are
    driven back, each group tailing off to its respective sty, as
    the herd approaches the villages, till the last grunter, having
    found his home, the drover seeks his cottage and repose.

PORK CUTLETS OR CHOPS.

I.

797. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of pork, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Cut the cutlets from a delicate loin of pork, bone and trim them neatly, and cut away
the greater portion of the fat. Season them with pepper; place the gridiron on the fire; when
quite hot, lay on the chops and broil them for about 1/4 hour, turning them 3 or 4 times; and
be particular that they are thoroughly done, but not dry. Dish them, sprinkle over a little
fine salt, and serve plain, or with tomato sauce, sauce piquante, or pickled gherkins, a few
of which should be laid round the dish as a garnish.

Time.--About 1/4 hour. Average cost, 10d. per lb. for chops.

Sufficient.--Allow 6 for 4 persons.

Seasonable from October to March.

II.

(Another Way.)

798. INGREDIENTS.--Loin or fore-loin, of pork, egg and bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste;
to every tablespoonful of bread crumbs allow 1/2 teaspoonful of minced sage; clarified butter.

Mode.--Cut the cutlets from a loin, or fore-loin, of pork; trim them the same as mutton cutlets,
and scrape the top part of the bone. Brush them over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs,
with which have been mixed minced sage and a seasoning of pepper and salt; drop a little clarified
butter on them, and press the crumbs well down. Put the frying-pan on the fire, put in some
lard; when this is hot, lay in the cutlets, and fry them a light brown on both sides. Take
them out, put them before the fire to dry the greasy moisture from them, and dish them on mashed
potatoes. Serve with them any sauce that may be preferred; such as tomato sauce, sauce piquante,
sauce Robert, or pickled gherkins.

Time.--From 15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, 10d. per lb. for chops.

Sufficient.--Allow 6 cutlets for 4 persons.

Seasonable from October to March.

Note.--The remains of roast loin of pork may be dressed in the same manner.

PORK CHEESE (an Excellent Breakfast Dish).

799. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of cold roast pork, pepper and salt to taste, 1 dessertspoonful of
minced parsley, 4 leaves of sage, a very small bunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded
mace, a little nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel; good strong gravy, sufficient
to fill the mould.

Mode.--Cut, but do not chop, the pork into fine pieces, and allow 1/4 lb. of fat to each pound
of lean. Season with pepper and salt; pound well the spices, and chop finely the parsley, sage,
herbs, and lemon-peel, and mix the whole nicely together. Put it into a mould, fill up with
good strong well-flavoured gravy, and bake rather more than one hour. When cold, turn it out
of the mould.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour.

Seasonable from October to March.

ROAST LEG OF PORK.

800. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of pork, a little oil for stuffing. (See Recipe No. 504.)

Mode.--Choose a small leg of pork, and score the skin across in narrow strips, about 1/4 inch
apart. Cut a slit in the knuckle, loosen the skin, and fill it with a sage-and-onion stuffing,
made by Recipe No. 504. Brush the joint over with a little salad-oil (this makes the crackling
crisper, and a better colour), and put it down to a bright, clear fire, not too near, as that
would cause the skin to blister. Baste it well, and serve with a little gravy made in the dripping-pan,
and do not omit to send to table with it a tureen of well-made apple-sauce.

Seasonable from September to March.

    ENGLISH MODE OF HUNTING, AND INDIAN PIG-STICKING.--The hunting
    of the wild boar has been in all times, and in all countries, a
    pastime of the highest interest and excitement, and from the age
    of Nimrod, has only been considered second to the more dangerous
    sport of lion-hunting. The buried treasures of Nineveh, restored
    to us by Mr. Layard, show us, on their sculptured annals, the
    kings of Assyria in their royal pastime of boar-hunting. That
    the Greeks were passionately attached to this sport, we know
    both from history and the romantic fables of the poets. Marc
    Antony, at one of his breakfasts with Cleopatra, had eight wild
    boars roasted whole; and though the Romans do not appear to
    have been addicted to hunting, wild-boar fights formed part of
    their gladiatorial shows in the amphitheatre. In France,
    Germany, and Britain, from the earliest time, the boar-hunt
    formed one of the most exciting of sports; but it was only in
    this country that the sport was conducted without dogs,--a real
    hand-to-hand contest of man and beast; the hunter, armed only
    with a boar-spear, a weapon about four feet long, the ash staff,
    guarded by plates of steel, and terminating in a long, narrow,
    and very sharp blade: this, with a hunting-knife, or hanger,
    completed his offensive arms. Thus equipped, the hunter would
    either encounter his enemy face to face, confront his desperate
    charge, as with erect tail, depressed head, and flaming eyes, he
    rushed with his foamy tusks full against him, who either sought
    to pierce his vitals through his counter, or driving his spear
    through his chine, transfix his heart; or failing those more
    difficult aims, plunge it into his flank, and, without
    withdrawing the weapon, strike his ready hanger into his throat.
    But expert as the hunter might be, it was not often the
    formidable brute was so quickly dispatched; for he would
    sometimes seize the spear in his powerful teeth, and nip it off
    like a reed, or, coming full tilt on his enemy, by his momentum
    and weight bear him to the earth, ripping up, with a horrid
    gash, his leg or side, and before the writhing hunter could draw
    his knife, the infuriated beast would plunge his snout in the
    wound, and rip, with savage teeth, the bowels of his victim. At
    other times, he would suddenly swerve from his charge, and
    doubling on his opponent, attack the hunter in the rear. From
    his speed, great weight, and savage disposition, the wild boar
    is always a dangerous antagonist, and requires great courage,
    coolness, and agility on the part of the hunter. The continental
    sportsman rides to the chase in a cavalcade, with music and
    dogs,--a kind of small hound or mastiff, and leaving all the
    honorary part of the contest to them, when the boar is becoming
    weary, and while beset by the dogs, rides up, and drives his
    lance home in the beast's back or side. Boar-hunting has been
    for some centuries obsolete in England, the animal no longer
    existing in a wild state among us; but in our Indian empire, and
    especially in Bengal, the pastime is pursued by our countrymen
    with all the daring of the national character; and as the animal
    which inhabits the cane-brakes and jungles is a formidable foe,
    the sport is attended with great excitement. The hunters,
    mounted on small, active horses, and armed only with long
    lances, ride, at early daylight, to the skirts of the jungle,
    and having sent in their attendants to beat the cover, wait till
    the tusked monster comes crashing from among the canes, when
    chase is immediately given, till he is come up with, and
    transfixed by the first weapon. Instead of flight, however, he
    often turns to bay, and by more than one dead horse and wounded
    hunter, shows how formidable he is, and what those polished
    tusks, sharp as pitch-forks, can effect, when the enraged animal
    defends his life.

TO GLAZE HAM.--(See Recipe No. 430.)

HASHED PORK.

801. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast pork, 2 onions, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 2 blades
of pounded mace, 2 cloves, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar, 1/2 pint of gravy, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Chop the onions and fry them of a nice brown, cut the pork into thin slices, season
them with pepper and salt, and add these to the remaining ingredients. Stew gently for about
1/2 hour, and serve garnished with sippets of toasted bread.

FRIED RASHERS OF BACON AND POACHED EGGS.

802. INGREDIENTS.--Bacon; eggs.

Mode.--Cut the bacon into thin slices, trim away the rusty parts, and cut off the rind. Put
it into a cold frying-pan, that is to say, do not place the pan on the fire before the bacon
is in it. Turn it 2 or 3 times, and dish it on a very hot dish. Poach the eggs and slip them
on to the bacon, without breaking the yolks, and serve quickly.

Time.--3 or 4 minutes. Average cost, 10d. to 1s. per lb. for the primest parts.

Sufficient.--Allow 6 eggs for 3 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Fried rashers of bacon, curled, serve as a pretty garnish to many dishes; and, for small
families, answer very well as a substitute for boiled bacon, to serve with a small dish of
poultry, &c.

BROILED RASHERS OF BACON (a Breakfast Dish).

803. Before purchasing bacon, ascertain that it is perfectly free from rust, which may easily
be detected by its yellow colour; and for broiling, the streaked part of the thick flank, is
generally the most esteemed. Cut it into thin slices, take off the rind, and broil over a nice
clear fire; turn it 2 or 3 times, and serve very hot. Should there be any cold bacon left from
the previous day, it answers very well for breakfast, cut into slices, and broiled or fried.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--When the bacon is cut very thin, the slices may be curled round and fastened by means
of small skewers, and fried or toasted before the fire.

BOILED BACON.

804. INGREDIENTS.--Bacon; water.

Mode.--As bacon is frequently excessively salt, let it be soaked in warm water for an hour
or two previous to dressing it; then pare off the rusty parts, and scrape the under-side and
rind as clean as possible. Put it into a saucepan of cold water, let it come gradually to a
boil, and as fast as the scum rises to the surface of the water, remove it. Let it simmer very
gently until it is thoroughly done; then take it up, strip off the skin, and sprinkle over
the bacon a few bread raspings, and garnish with tufts of cauliflower or Brussels sprouts.
When served alone, young and tender broad beans or green peas are the usual accompaniments.

Seasonable at any time.

TO CURE BACON IN THE WILTSHIRE WAY.

805. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of coarse sugar, 1-1/2 lb. of bay-salt, 6 oz. of saltpetre, 1
lb. of common salt.

Mode.--Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for 24 hours; then pound
and mix the above ingredients well together and rub it well into the meat, which should be
turned every day for a month; then hang it to dry, and afterwards smoke it for 10 days.

Time.--To remain in the pickle 1 month, to be smoked 10 days.

Sufficient.--The above quantity of salt for 1 pig.

    HOW PIGS WERE FORMERLY PASTURED AND FED.--Though unquestionably
    far greater numbers of swine are now kept in England than
    formerly, every peasant having one or more of that useful
    animal, in feudal times immense droves of pigs were kept by the
    franklings and barons; in those days the swine-herds being a
    regular part of the domestic service of every feudal household,
    their duty consisted in daily driving the herd of swine from the
    castle-yard, or outlying farm, to the nearest woods, chase, or
    forest, where the frankling or vavasour had, either by right or
    grant, what was called free warren, or the liberty to feed his
    hogs off the acorns, beech, and chestnuts that lay in such
    abundance on the earth, and far exceeded the power of the royal
    or privileged game to consume. Indeed, it was the license
    granted the nobles of free warren, especially for their swine,
    that kept up the iniquitous forest laws to so late a date, and
    covered so large a portion of the land with such immense tracts
    of wood and brake, to the injury of agriculture and the misery
    of the people. Some idea of the extent to which swine were
    grazed in the feudal times, may be formed by observing the
    number of pigs still fed in Epping Forest, the Forest of Dean,
    and the New Forest, in Hampshire, where, for several months of
    the year, the beech-nuts and acorns yield them so plentiful a
    diet. In Germany, where the chestnut is so largely cultivated,
    the amount of food shed every autumn is enormous; and
    consequently the pig, both wild and domestic, has, for a
    considerable portion of the year, an unfailing supply of
    admirable nourishment. Impressed with the value of this fruit
    for the food of pigs, the Prince Consort has, with great
    judgment, of late encouraged the collection of chestnuts in
    Windsor Park, and by giving a small reward to old people and
    children for every bushel collected, has not only found an
    occupation for many of the unemployed poor, but, by providing a
    gratuitous food for their pig, encouraged a feeling of
    providence and economy.

FOR CURING BACON, AND KEEPING IT FREE FROM RUST (Cobbett's Recipe).

806. THE TWO SIDES THAT REMAIN, and which are called flitches, are to be cured for bacon. They
are first rubbed with salt on their insides, or flesh sides, then placed one on the other,
the flesh sides uppermost, in a salting-trough which has a gutter round its edges to drain
away the brine; for, to have sweet and fine bacon, the flitches must not be sopping in brine,
which gives it the sort of vile taste that barrel and sea pork have. Every one knows how different
is the taste of fresh dry salt from that of salt in a dissolved state; therefore change the
salt often,--once in 4 or 5 days; let it melt and sink in, but not lie too long; twice change
the flitches, put that at bottom which was first on the top: this mode will cost you a great
deal more in salt than the sopping mode, but without it your bacon will not be so sweet and
fine, nor keep so well. As for the time required in making your flitches sufficiently salt,
it depends on circumstances. It takes a longer time for a thick than a thin flitch, and longer
in dry than in damp weather, or in a dry than in a damp place; but for the flitches of a hog
of five score, in weather not very dry or damp, about 6 weeks may do; and as yours is to be
fat, which receives little injury from over-salting, give time enough, for you are to have
bacon until Christmas comes again.

807. THE PLACE FOR SALTING SHOULD, like a dairy, always be cool, but well ventilated; confined
air, though cool, will taint meat sooner than the midday day sun accompanied by a breeze. With
regard to smoking the bacon, two precautions are necessary: first, to hang the flitches where
no rain comes down upon them; and next, that the smoke must proceed from wood, not peat, turf,
or coal. As to the time required to smoke a flitch, it depends a good deal upon whether there
be a constant fire beneath; and whether the fire be large or small: a month will do, if the
fire be pretty constant and rich, as a farmhouse fire usually is; but over-smoking, or rather
too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon rust; great attention should therefore be paid
to this matter. The flitch ought not to be dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it
ought to be perfectly dry. Before you hang it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh side
pretty thickly over with bran, or with some fine sawdust, not of deal or fir; rub it on the
flesh, or pat it well down upon it: this keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings,
and makes a sort of crust to be dried on.

808. To KEEP THE BACON SWEET AND GOOD, and free from hoppers, sift fine some clean and dry
wood ashes. Put some at the bottom of a box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon;
lay in one flitch, and then put in more ashes, then another flitch, and cover this with six
or eight inches of the ashes. The place where the box or chest is kept ought to be dry, and
should the ashes become damp, they should be put in the fireplace to dry, and when cold, put
back again. With these precautions, the bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on
the first day.

809. FOR SIMPLE GENERAL RULES; these may be safely taken as a guide; and those who implicitly
follow the directions given, will possess at the expiration of from 6 weeks to 2 months well-flavoured
and well-cured bacon.

    HOG NOT BACON. ANECDOTE OF LORD BACON.--As Lord Bacon, on one
    occasion, was about to pass sentence of death upon a man of the
    name of Hogg, who had just been tried for a long career of
    crime, the prisoner suddenly claimed to be heard in arrest of
    judgment, saying, with an expression of arch confidence as he
    addressed the bench, "I claim indulgence, my lord, on the plea
    of relationship; for I am convinced your lordship will never be
    unnatural enough to hang one of your own family."

    "Indeed, replied the judge, with some amazement," I was not
    aware that I had the honour of your alliance; perhaps you will
    be good enough to name the degree of our mutual affinity."

    "I am sorry, my lord," returned the impudent thief, "I cannot
    trace the links of consanguinity; but the moral evidence is
    sufficiently pertinent. My name, my lord, is Hogg, your
    lordship's is Bacon; and all the world will allow that bacon and
    hog are very closely allied."

    "I am sorry," replied his lordship, "I cannot admit the truth of
    your instance: hog cannot be bacon till it is hanged; and so,
    before I can admit your plea, or acknowledge the family compact,
    Hogg must be hanged to-morrow morning."

TO BAKE A HAM.

810. INGREDIENTS.--Ham; a common crust.

Mode.--As a ham for baking should be well soaked, let it remain in water for at least 12 hours.
Wipe it dry, trim away any rusty places underneath, and cover it with a common crust, taking
care that this is of sufficient thickness all over to keep the gravy in. Place it in a moderately-heated
oven, and bake for nearly 4 hours. Take off the crust, and skin, and cover with raspings, the
same as for boiled ham, and garnish the knuckle with a paper frill. This method of cooking
a ham is, by many persons, considered far superior to boiling it, as it cuts fuller of gravy
and has a finer flavour, besides keeping a much longer time good.

Time.--A medium-sized ham, 4 hours.

Average cost, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. by the whole ham.

Seasonable all the year.

TO BOIL A HAM.

811. INGREDIENTS.--Ham, water, glaze or raspings.

Mode.--In choosing a ham, ascertain that it is perfectly sweet, by running a sharp knife into
it, close to the bone; and if, when the knife is withdrawn, it has an agreeable smell, the
ham is good; if, on the contrary, the blade has a greasy appearance and offensive smell, the
ham is bad. If it has been long hung, and is very dry and salt, let it remain in soak for 24
hours, changing the water frequently. This length of time is only necessary in the case of
its being very hard; from 8 to 12 hours would be sufficient for a Yorkshire or Westmoreland
ham. Wash it thoroughly clean, and trim away from the under-side, all the rusty and smoked
parts, which would spoil the appearance. Put it into a boiling-pot, with sufficient cold water
to cover it; bring it gradually to boil, and as the scum rises, carefully remove it. Keep it
simmering very gently until tender, and be careful that it does not stop boiling, nor boil
too quickly. When done, take it out of the pot, strip off the skin, and sprinkle over it a
few fine bread-raspings, put a frill of cut paper round the knuckle, and serve. If to be eaten
cold, let the ham remain in the water until nearly cold: by this method the juices are kept
in, and it will be found infinitely superior to one taken out of the water hot; it should,
however, be borne in mind that the ham must not remain in the saucepan all night. When the
skin is removed, sprinkle over bread-raspings, or, if wanted particularly nice, glaze it. Place
a paper frill round the knuckle, and garnish with parsley or cut vegetable flowers.

812. INGREDIENTS.--Vinegar and water, 2 heads of celery, 2 turnips, 3 onions, a large bunch
of savoury herbs.

Mode.--Prepare the ham as in the preceding recipe, and let it soak for a few hours in vinegar
and water. Put it on in cold water, and when it boils, add the vegetables and herbs. Simmer
very gently until tender, take it out, strip off the skin, cover with bread-raspings, and put
a paper ruche or frill round the knuckle.

    HOW TO SILENCE A PIG. ANECDOTE OF CHARLES V.--When the emperor
    Charles V. was one day walking in the neighbourhood of Vienna,
    full of pious considerations, engendered by the thoughts of the
    Dominican cloister he was about to visit, he was much annoyed by
    the noise of a pig, which a country youth was carrying a little
    way before him. At length, irritated by the unmitigated noise,
    "Have you not learned how to quiet a pig" demanded the imperial
    traveller, tartly. "Noa," replied the ingenuous peasant,
    ignorant of the quality of his interrogator;--"noa; and I should
    very much like to know how to do it," changing the position of
    his burthen, and giving his load a surreptitious pinch of the
    ear, which immediately altered the tone and volume of his
    complaining.

    "Why, take the pig by the tail," said the emperor, "and you will
    see how quiet he will become."

    Struck by the novelty of the suggestion, the countryman at once
    dangled his noisy companion by the tail, and soon discovered
    that, under the partial congestion caused by its inverted
    position, the pig had indeed become silent; when, looking with
    admiration on his august adviser, he exclaimed,--

    "Ah, you must have learned the trade much longer than I, for you
    understand it a great deal better."

FRIED HAM AND EGGS (a Breakfast Dish).

813. INGREDIENTS.--Ham; eggs.

Mode.--Cut the ham into slices, and take care that they are of the same thickness in every
part. Cut off the rind, and if the ham should be particularly hard and salt, it will be found
an improvement to soak it for about 10 minutes in hot water, and then dry it in a cloth. Put
it into a cold frying-pan, set it over the fire, and turn the slices 3 or 4 times whilst they
are cooking. When done, place them on a dish, which should be kept hot in front of the fire
during the time the eggs are being poached. Poach the eggs, slip them on to the slices of ham,
and serve quickly.

Time.--7 or 8 minutes to broil the ham.

Note.--Ham may also be toasted or broiled; but, with the latter method, to insure its being
well cooked, the fire must be beautifully clear, or it will have a smoky flavour far from agreeable.

POTTED HAM, that will keep Good for some time.

I.

814. INGREDIENTS.--To 4 lbs. of lean ham allow 1 lb. of fat, 2 teaspoonfuls of pounded mace,
1/2 nutmeg grated, rather more than 1/2 teaspoonful of cayenne, clarified lard.

Mode.--Mince the ham, fat and lean together in the above proportion, and pound it well in a
mortar, seasoning it with cayenne pepper, pounded mace, and nutmeg; put the mixture into a
deep baking-dish, and bake for 1/2 hour; then press it well into a stone jar, fill up the jar
with clarified lard, cover it closely, and paste over it a piece of thick paper. If well seasoned,
it will keep a long time in winter, and will be found very convenient for sandwiches, &c.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

II.

(A nice addition to the Breakfast or Luncheon table.)

815. INGREDIENTS.--To 2 lbs. of lean ham allow 1/2 lb. of fat, 1 teaspoonful of pounded mace,
1/2 teaspoonful of pounded allspice, 1/2 nutmeg, pepper to taste, clarified butter.

Mode.--Cut some slices from the remains of a cold ham, mince them small, and to every 2 lbs.
of lean, allow the above proportion of fat. Pound the ham in a mortar to a fine paste, with
the fat, gradually add the seasoning and spices, and be very particular that all the ingredients
are well mixed and the spices well pounded. Press the mixture into potting-pots, pour over
clarified butter, and keep it in a cool place.

Average cost for this quantity, 2s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

    IMPORTANCE OF THE BOAR'S HEAD, SCOTTISH FEUDS, &c.--The boar's
    head, in ancient times, formed the most important dish on the
    table, and was invariably the first placed on the board upon
    Christmas-day, being preceded by a body of servitors, a flourish
    of trumpets, and other marks of distinction and reverence, and
    carried into the hall by the individual of next rank to the lord
    of the feast. At some of our colleges and inns of court, the
    serving of the boar's head on a silver platter on Christmas-day
    is a custom still followed; and till very lately, a bore's head
    was competed for at Christmas time by the young men of a rural
    parish in Essex. Indeed, so highly was the grizzly boar's head
    regarded in former times, that it passed into a cognizance of
    some of the noblest families in the realm: thus it was not only
    the crest of the Nevills and Warwicks, with their collateral
    houses, but it was the cognizance of Richard III., that--

      "Wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
       That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
       Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
       In your embowell'd bosoms,"--

    and whose nature it was supposed to typify; and was universally
    used as a sign to taverns. The Boar's Head in Eastcheap,
    which, till within the last twenty-five years still stood in all
    its primitive quaintness, though removed to make way for the
    London-bridge approaches, will live vividly in the mind of every
    reader of Shakspeare, as the resort of the prince of Wales,
    Poins, and his companions, and the residence of Falstaff and his
    coney-catching knaves, Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym; and whose sign
    was a boar's head, carved in stone over the door, and a smaller
    one in wood on each side of the doorway.

    The traditions and deeds of savage vengeance recorded in
    connection with this grim trophy of the chase are numerous in
    all parts of Europe. But the most remarkable connected with the
    subject in this country, were two events that occurred in
    Scotland, about the 11th and 15th centuries.

    A border family having been dispossessed of their castle and
    lands by a more powerful chief, were reduced for many years to
    great indigence, the expelled owner only living in the hope of
    wreaking a terrible vengeance, which, agreeably to the motto of
    his house, he was content to "bide his time" for. The usurper
    having invited a large number of his kindred to a grand hunt in
    his new domains, and a feast after in the great hall, returned
    from the chase, and discovering the feast not spread, vented his
    wrath in no measured terms on the heads of the tardy servitors.
    At length a menial approached, followed by a line of servants,
    and placing the boar's head on the table, the guests rushed
    forward to begin the meal; when, to their horror, they
    discovered, not a boar's but a bull's head,--a sign of death.
    The doors were immediately closed, and the false servants, who
    were the adherents of the dispossessed chief, threw off their
    disguise, and falling on the usurper and his friends, butchered
    them and every soul in the castle belonging to the rival
    faction.

    A tribe of caterans, or mountain robbers, in the Western
    Highlands, having been greatly persecuted by a powerful chief of
    the district, waylaid him and his retinue, put them all to the
    sword, and cutting off the chief's head, repaired to his castle,
    where they ordered the terrified wife to supply them with food
    and drink. To appease their savage humour, the lady gave order
    for their entertainment, and on returning to the hall to see her
    orders were complied with, discovered, in place of the boar's
    head that should have graced the board, her husband's bleeding
    head; the savage caterans, in rude derision, as a substitute for
    the apple or lemon usually placed between the jaws, having
    thrust a slice of bread in the dead man's mouth.

FOR CURING HAMS (Mons. Ude's Recipe).

816. INGREDIENTS.--For 2 hams weighing about 16 or 18 lbs. each, allow 1 lb. of moist sugar,
1 lb. of common salt, 2 oz. of saltpetre, 1 quart of good vinegar.

Mode.--As soon as the pig is cold enough to be cut up, take the 2 hams and rub them well with
common salt, and leave them in a large pan for 3 days. When the salt has drawn out all the
blood, drain the hams, and throw the brine away. Mix sugar, salt, and saltpetre together in
the above proportion, rub the hams well with these, and put them into a vessel large enough
to hold them, always keeping the salt over them. Let them remain for 3 days, then pour over
them a quart of good vinegar. Turn them in the brine every day for a month, then drain them
well, and rub them with bran. Have them smoked over a wood fire, and be particular that the
hams are hung as high up as possible from the fire; otherwise the fat will melt, and they will
become dry and hard.

Time.--To be pickled 1 month; to be smoked 1 month.

Sufficient for 2 hams of 18 lbs. each.

Seasonable from October to March.

    THE PRICE OF A SOW IN AFRICA.--In one of the native states of
    Africa, a pig one day stole a piece of food from a child as it
    was in the act of conveying the morsel to its mouth; upon which
    the robbed child cried so loud that the mother rushed out of her
    hovel to ascertain the cause; and seeing the purloining pig make
    off munching his booty, the woman in her heat struck the grunter
    so smart a blow, that the surly rascal took it into his head to
    go home very much indisposed, and after a certain time resolved
    to die,--a resolution that he accordingly put into practice;
    upon which the owner instituted judicial proceedings before the
    Star Chamber court of his tribe, against the husband and family
    of the woman whose rash act had led to such results; and as the
    pig happened to be a sow, in the very flower of her age, the
    prospective loss to the owner in unnumbered teems of pigs, with
    the expenses attending so high a tribunal, swelled the damages
    and costs to such a sum, that it was found impossible to pay
    them. And as, in the barbarous justice existing among these rude
    people, every member of a family is equally liable as the
    individual who committed the wrong, the father, mother,
    children, relatives,--an entire community, to the number of
    thirty-two souls, were sold as slaves, and a fearful sum of
    human misery perpetrated, to pay the value of a thieving old
    sow.

TO SALT TWO HAMS, about 12 or 15 lbs. each.

817. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of treacle, 1/2 lb. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of bay-salt, 2 pounds of
common salt.

Mode.--Two days before they are put into pickle, rub the hams well with salt, to draw away
all slime and blood. Throw what comes from them away, and then rub them with treacle, saltpetre,
and salt. Lay them in a deep pan, and let them remain one day; boil the above proportion of
treacle, saltpetre, bay-salt, and common salt for 1/4 hour, and pour this pickle boiling hot
over the hams: there should be sufficient of it to cover them. For a day or two rub them well
with it; afterwards they will only require turning. They ought to remain in this pickle for
3 weeks or a month, and then be sent to be smoked, which will take nearly or quite a month
to do. An ox-tongue pickled in this way is most excellent, to be eaten either green or smoked.

Time.--To remain in the pickle 3 weeks or a month; to be smoked about a month.

Seasonable from October to March.

TO CURE SWEET HAMS IN THE WESTMORELAND WAY.

818. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of common salt, 3 lbs. of coarse sugar, 1 lb. of bay-salt, 3 quarts
of strong beer.

Mode.--Before the hams are put into pickle, rub them the preceding day well with salt, and
drain the brine well from them. Put the above ingredients into a saucepan, and boil for 1/4
hour; pour over the hams, and let them remain a month in the pickle. Rub and turn them every
day, but do not take them out of the pickling-pan; and have them smoked for a month.

Time.--To be pickled 1 month; to be smoked 1 month.

Seasonable from October to March.

TO PICKLE HAMS (Suffolk Recipe).

819. INGREDIENTS.--To a ham from 10 to 12 lbs., allow 1 lb. of coarse sugar, 3/4 lb. of salt,
1 oz. of saltpetre, 1/2 a teacupful of vinegar.

Mode.--Rub the hams well with common salt, and leave them for a day or two to drain; then rub
well in, the above proportion of sugar, salt, saltpetre, and vinegar, and turn them every other
day. Keep them in the pickle 1 month, drain them, and send them to be smoked over a wood fire
for 3 weeks or a month.

Time.--To remain in the pickle 1 month. To be smoked 3 weeks or 1 month.

Sufficient.--The above proportion of pickle sufficient for 1 ham.

Seasonable.--Hams should be pickled from October to March.

    NOVEL WAY OF RECOVERING A STOLEN PIG.--It is a well-known fact,
    that in Ireland the pig is, in every respect, a domesticated
    animal, sharing often both the bed and board of the family, and
    making an outer ring to the domestic circle, as, seated round
    the pot of potatoes, they partake of the midday meal called
    dinner. An Irishman upon one occasion having lost an interesting
    member of his household, in the form of a promising young
    porker, consulted his priest on the occasion, and having hinted
    at the person he suspected of purloining the "illegant slip of a
    pig" he was advised to take no further notice of the matter, but
    leave the issue to his spiritual adviser. Next Sunday his
    reverence, after mass, came to the front of the altar-rails, and
    looking very hard at the supposed culprit, exclaimed, "Who stole
    Pat Doolan's pig?" To this inquiry there was of course no
    answer;--the priest did not expect there would be any. The
    following Sunday the same query was propounded a little
    stronger--"Who of you was it, I say, who stole poor Pat Doolan's
    pig?" It now became evident that the culprit was a hardened
    sinner; so on the third Sunday, instead of repeating the
    unsatisfactory inquiry, the priest, after, as usual, eyeing the
    obdurate offender, said, in a tone of pious sorrow, "Mike Regan,
    Mike Regan, you treat me with contempt!" That night, when the
    family was all asleep, the latch of the door was noiselessly
    lifted, and the "illegant slip of a pig" cautiously slipped into
    the cabin.

TO SMOKE HAMS AND FISH AT HOME.

820. Take an old hogshead, stop up all the crevices, and fix a place to put a cross-stick near
the bottom, to hang the articles to be smoked on. Next, in the side, cut a hole near the top,
to introduce an iron pan filled with sawdust and small pieces of green wood. Having turned
the tub upside down, hang the articles upon the cross-stick, introduce the iron pan in the
opening, and place a piece of red-hot iron in the pan, cover it with sawdust, and all will
be complete. Let a large ham remain 40 hours, and keep up a good smoke.

TO CURE BACON OR HAMS IN THE DEVONSHIRE WAY.

821. INGREDIENTS.--To every 14 lbs. of meat, allow 2 oz. of saltpetre, 2 oz. of salt prunella,
1 lb. of common salt. For the pickle, 3 gallons of water, 5 lbs. of common salt, 7 lbs. of
coarse sugar, 3 lbs. of bay-salt.

Mode.--Weigh the sides, hams, and cheeks, and to every 14 lbs. allow the above proportion of
saltpetre, salt prunella, and common salt. Pound and mix these together, and rub well into
the meat; lay it in a stone trough or tub, rubbing it thoroughly, and turning it daily for
2 successive days. At the end of the second day, pour on it a pickle made as follows:--Put
the above ingredients into a saucepan, set it on the fire, and stir frequently; remove all
the scum, allow it to boil for 1/4 hour, and pour it hot over the meat. Let the hams, &c.,
be well rubbed and turned daily; if the meat is small, a fortnight will be sufficient for the
sides and shoulders to remain in the pickle, and the hams 3 weeks; if from 30 lbs. and upwards,
3 weeks will be required for the sides, &c., and from 4 to 5 weeks for the hams. On taking
the pieces out, let them drain for an hour, cover with dry sawdust, and smoke from a fortnight
to 3 weeks. Boil and carefully skim the pickle after using, and it will keep good, closely
corked, for 2 years. When boiling it for use, add about 2 lbs. of common salt, and the same
of treacle, to allow for waste. Tongues are excellent put into this pickle cold, having been
first rubbed well with saltpetre and salt, and allowed to remain 24 hours, not forgetting to
make a deep incision under the thick part of the tongue, so as to allow the pickle to penetrate
more readily. A fortnight or 3 weeks, according to the size of the tongue, will be sufficient.

Time--Small meat to remain in the pickle a fortnight, hams 3 weeks; to be smoked from a fortnight
to 3 weeks.

The following is from Morton's "Cyclopaedia of Agriculture," and will be found fully worthy
of the high character of that publication.

CURING OF HAMS AND BACON.

822. The carcass of the hog, after hanging over-night to cool, is laid on a strong bench or
stool, and the head is separated from the body at the neck, close behind the ears; the feet
and also the internal fat are removed. The carcass is next divided into two sides in the following
manner:--The ribs are divided about an inch from the spine on each side, and the spine, with
the ends of the ribs attached, together with the internal flesh between it and the kidneys,
and also the flesh above it, throughout the whole length of the sides, are removed. The portion
of the carcass thus cut out is in the form of a wedge--the breadth of the interior consisting
of the breadth of the spine, and about an inch of the ribs on each side, being diminished to
about half an inch at the exterior or skin along the back. The breast-bone, and also the first
anterior rib, are also dissected from the side. Sometimes the whole of the ribs are removed;
but this, for reasons afterwards to be noticed, is a very bad practice. When the hams are cured
separately from the sides, which is generally the case, they are cut out so as to include the
hock-bone, in a similar manner to the London mode of cutting a haunch of mutton. The carcass
of the hog thus cut up is ready for being salted, which process, in large caring establishments,
is generally as follows. The skin side of the pork is rubbed over with a mixture of fifty parts
by weight of salt, and one part of saltpetre in powder, and the incised parts of the ham or
flitch, and the inside of the flitch covered with the same. The salted bacon, in pairs of flitches
with the insides to each other, is piled one pair of flitches above another on benches slightly
inclined, and furnished with spouts or troughs to convey the brine to receivers in the floor
of the salting-house, to be afterwards used for pickling pork for navy purposes. In this state
the bacon remains a fortnight, which is sufficient for flitches cut from nogs of a carcass
weight less than 15 stone (14 lbs. to the stone). Flitches of a larger size, at the expiration
of that time, are wiped dry and reversed in their place in the pile, having, at the same time,
about half the first quantity of fresh, dry, common salt sprinkled over the inside and incised
parts; after which they remain on the benches for another week. Hams being thicker than flitches,
will require, when less than 20 lbs. weight, 3 weeks; and when above that weight, 4 weeks to
remain under the above-described process. The next and last process in the preparation of bacon
and hams, previous to being sent to market, is drying. This is effected by hanging the flitches
and hams for 2 or 3 weeks in a room heated by stoves, or in a smoke-house, in which they are
exposed for the same length of time to the smoke arising from the slow combustion of the sawdust
of oak or other hard wood. The latter mode of completing the curing process has some advantages
over the other, as by it the meat is subject to the action of creosote, a volatile oil produced
by the combustion of the sawdust, which is powerfully antiseptic. The process also furnishing
a thin covering of a resinous varnish, excludes the air not only from the muscle but also from
the fat; thus effectually preventing the meat from becoming rusted; and the principal reasons
for condemning the practice of removing the ribs from the flitches of pork are, that by so
doing the meat becomes unpleasantly hard and pungent in the process of salting, and by being
more opposed to the action of the air, becomes sooner and more extensively rusted. Notwithstanding
its superior efficacy in completing the process of curing, the flavour which smoke-drying imparts
to meat is disliked by many persons, and it is therefore by no means the most general mode
of drying adopted by mercantile curers. A very impure variety of pyroligneous acid, or vinegar
made from the destructive distillation of wood, is sometimes used, on account of the highly
preservative power of the creosote which it contains, and also to impart the smoke-flavour;
in which latter object, however, the coarse flavour of tar is given, rather than that derived
from the smoke from combustion of wood. A considerable portion of the bacon and hams salted
in Ireland is exported from that country packed amongst salt, in bales, immediately from the
salting process, without having been in any degree dried. In the process of salting above described,
pork loses from eight to ten per cent. of its weight, according to the size and quality of
the meat; and a further diminution of weight, to the extent of five to six per cent., takes
place in drying during the first fortnight after being taken out of salt; so that the total
loss in weight occasioned by the preparation of bacon and hams in a proper state for market,
is not less on an average than fifteen per cent. on the weight of the fresh pork.

COLLARED PIG'S FACE (a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish).

823. INGREDIENTS.--1 pig's face; salt. For brine, 1 gallon of spring water, 1 lb. of common
salt, 1/2 handful of chopped juniper-berries, 6 bruised cloves, 2 bay-leaves, a few sprigs
of thyme, basil, sage, 1/4 oz. of saltpetre. For forcemeat, 1/2 lb. of ham, 1/2 lb. bacon,
1 teaspoonful of mixed spices, pepper to taste, 1/4 lb. of lard, 1 tablespoonful of minced
parsley, 6 young onions.

Mode.--Singe the head carefully, bone it without breaking the skin, and rub it well with salt.
Make the brine by boiling the above ingredients for 1/4 hour, and letting it stand to cool.
When cold, pour it over the head, and let it steep in this for 10 days, turning and rubbing
it often. Then wipe, drain, and dry it. For the forcemeat, pound the ham and bacon very finely,
and mix with these the remaining ingredients, taking care that the whole is thoroughly incorporated.
Spread this equally over the head, roll it tightly in a cloth, and bind it securely with broad
tape. Put it into a saucepan with a few meat trimmings, and cover it with stock; let it simmer
gently for 4 hours, and be particular that it does not stop boiling the whole time. When quite
tender, take it up, put it between 2 dishes with a heavy weight on the top, and when cold,
remove the cloth and tape. It should be sent to table on a napkin, or garnished with a piece
of deep white paper with a ruche at the top.

Time.--4 hours. Average cost, from 2s. to 2s. 6d.

Seasonable from October to March.

    THE WILD AND DOMESTIC HOG.--The domestic hog is the descendant
    of a race long since banished from this island; and it is
    remarkable, that while the tamed animal has been and is kept
    under surveillance, the wild type whence this race sprung, has
    maintained itself in its ancient freedom, the fierce denizen of
    the forest, and one of the renowned beasts of the chase.
    Whatever doubt may exist as to the true origin of the dog, the
    horse, the ox, and others, or as to whether their original race
    is yet extant or not, these doubts do not apply to the domestic
    hog. Its wild source still exists, and is universally
    recognized: like the wolf, however, it has been expelled from
    our island; but, like that animal, it still roams through the
    vast wooded tracts of Europe and Asia.

TO DRESS PIG'S FRY (a Savoury Dish).

824. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of pig's fry, 2 onions, a few sage-leaves, 3 lbs. of potatoes,
pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Put the lean fry at the bottom of a pie-dish, sprinkle over it some minced sage and
onion, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; slice the potatoes; put a layer of these on the
seasoning, then the fat fry, then more seasoning, and a layer of potatoes at the top. Fill
the dish with boiling water, and bake for 2 hours, or rather longer.

Seasonable from October to March.

TO MELT LARD.

825. Melt the inner fat of the pig, by putting it in a stone jar, and placing this in a saucepan
of boiling water, previously stripping off the skin. Let it simmer gently over a bright fire,
and as it melts, pour it carefully from the sediment. Put it into small jars or bladders for
use, and keep it in a cool place. The flead or inside fat of the pig, before it is melted,
makes exceedingly light crust, and is particularly wholesome. It may be preserved a length
of time by salting it well, and occasionally changing the brine. When wanted for use, wash
and wipe it, and it will answer for making into paste as well as fresh lard.

Average cost, 10d. per lb.

BOILED LEG OF PORK.

826. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of pork; salt. An hour before dressing it, put it into cold water for
an hour, which improves the colour. If the pork is purchased ready salted, ascertain how long
the meat has been in pickle, and soak it accordingly. Put it into a boiling-pot, with sufficient
cold water to cover it; let it gradually come to a boil, and remove the scum as it rises. Simmer
it very gently until tender, and do not allow it to boil fast, or the knuckle will fall to
pieces before the middle of the leg is done. Carrots, turnips, or parsnips may be boiled with
the pork, some of which should be laid round the dish as a garnish, and a well-made pease-pudding
is an indispensable accompaniment.

Average cost, 9d. per lb.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from September to March.

Note.--The liquor in which a leg of pork has been boiled, makes excellent pea-soup.

    ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG.--The hog has survived changes which have
    swept multitudes of pachydermatous animals from the surface of
    our earth. It still presents the same characteristics, both
    physical and moral, which the earliest writers, whether sacred
    or profane, have faithfully delineated. Although the domestic
    has been more or less modified by long culture, yet the wild
    species remains unaltered, insomuch that the fossil relics may
    be identified with the bones of their existing descendants.

ROAST GRISKIN OF PORK.

827. INGREDIENTS.--Pork; a little powdered sage.

Mode.--As this joint frequently comes to table hard and dry, particular care should be taken
that it is well basted. Put it down to a bright fire, and flour it. About 10 minutes before
taking it up, sprinkle over some powdered sage; make a little gravy in the dripping-pan, strain
it over the meat, and serve with a tureen of apple sauce. This joint will be done in far less
time than when the skin is left on, consequently, should have the greatest attention that it
be not dried up. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from September to March.

Note.--A spare-rib of pork is roasted in the same manner as above, and would take 1-1/2 hour
for one weighing about 6 lbs.

LARDING.

828. INGREDIENTS.--Bacon and larding-needle.

Mode.--Bacon for larding should be firm and fat, and ought to be cured without any saltpetre,
as this reddens white meats. Lay it on a table, the rinds downwards; trim off any rusty part,
and cut it into slices of an equal thickness. Place the slices one on the top of another, and
cut them evenly into narrow strips, so arranging it that every piece of bacon is of the same
size. Bacon for fricandeau, poultry, and game, should be about 2 inches in length, and rather
more than one-eighth of an inch in width. If for larding fillets of beef or loin of veal, the
pieces of bacon must be thicker. The following recipe of Soyer is, we think, very explicit;
and any cook, by following the directions here given, may be able to lard, if not well, sufficiently
for general use.

"Have the fricandeau trimmed, lay it, lengthwise, upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming
a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at; then with the point
of the larding-needle make three distinct lines across, 1/2 inch apart; run the needle into
the third line, at the further side of the fricandeau, and bring it out at the first, placing
one of the lardoons in it; draw the needle through, leaving out 1/4 inch of the bacon at each
line; proceed thus to the end of the row; then make another line, 1/2 inch distant, stick in
another row of lardoons, bringing them out at the second line, leaving the ends of the bacon
out all the same length; make the next row again at the same distance, bringing the ends out
between the lardoons of the first row, proceeding in this manner until the whole surface is
larded in chequered rows. Everything else is larded in a similar way; and, in the case of poultry,
hold the breast over a charcoal fire for one minute, or dip it into boiling water, in order
to make the flesh firm."

ROAST LOIN OF PORK.

829. INGREDIENTS.--Pork; a little salt.

Mode.--Score the skin in strips rather more than 1/4 inch apart, and place the joint at a good
distance from the fire, on account of the crackling, which would harden before the meat would
be heated through, were it placed too near. If very lean, it should be rubbed over with a little
salad oil, and kept well basted all the time it is at the fire. Pork should be very thoroughly
cooked, but not dry; and be careful never to send it to table the least underdone, as nothing
is more unwholesome and disagreeable than underdressed white meats. Serve with apple sauce,
No. 363, and a little gravy made in the dripping-pan. A stuffing of sage and onion may be made
separately, and baked in a flat dish: this method is better than putting it in the meat, as
many persons have so great an objection to the flavour.

Time.--A loin of pork weighing 5 lbs., about 2 hours: allow more time should it be very fat.

    FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE HOG.--In British strata, the oldest fossil
    remains of the hog which Professor Owen states that he has
    examined, were from fissures in the red crag (probably miocene)
    of Newbourne, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. "They were associated
    with teeth of an extinct felis about the size of a leopard,
    with those of a bear, and with remains of a large cervus. These
    mammalian remains were found with the ordinary fossils of the
    red crag: they had undergone the same process of trituration,
    and were impregnated with the same colouring matter as the
    associated bones and teeth of fishes acknowledged to be derived
    from the regular strata of the red crag. These mammaliferous
    beds have been proved by Mr. Lyell to be older than the
    fluvio-marine, or Norwich crag, in which remains of the
    mastodon, rhinoceros, and horse have been discovered; and still
    older than the fresh-water pleistocene deposits, from which the
    remains of the mammoth, rhinoceros, &c. are obtained in such
    abundance. I have met," says the professor, in addition, "with
    some satisfactory instances of the association of fossil remains
    of a species of hog with those of the mammoth, in the newer
    pliocene freshwater formations of England."

TO DRY PIGS' CHEEKS.

830. INGREDIENTS.--Salt, 4 oz. of saltpetre, 2 oz. of bay-salt, 4 oz. of coarse sugar.

Mode.--Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split the head, taking off the upper bone
to make the jowl a good shape; rub it well with salt; next day take away the brine, and salt
it again the following day; cover the head with saltpetre, bay-salt, and coarse sugar, in the
above proportion, adding a little common salt. Let the head be often turned, and when it has
been in the pickle for 10 days, smoke it for a week or rather longer.

Time.--To remain in the pickle 10 days; to be smoked 1 week.

Seasonable.--Should be made from September to March.

Note.--A pig's check, or Bath chap, will take about 2 hours after the water boils.

PIG'S LIVER (a Savoury and Economical Dish).

831. INGREDIENTS.--The liver and lights of a pig, 6 or 7 slices of bacon, potatoes, 1 large
bunch of parsley, 2 onions, 2 sage-leaves, pepper and salt to taste, a little broth or water.

Mode.--Slice the liver and lights, and wash these perfectly clean, and parboil the potatoes;
mince the parsley and sage, and chop the onion rather small. Put the meat, potatoes, and bacon
into a deep tin dish, in alternate layers, with a sprinkling of the herbs, and a seasoning
of pepper and salt between each; pour on a little water or broth, and bake in a moderately-heated
oven for 2 hours.

Seasonable from September to March.

PIG'S PETTITOES.

832. Keep stewing the feet until quite tender, which will be in from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour,
reckoning from the time that they boiled up first; then put back the minced liver, thicken
the gravy with a little butter and flour, season with pepper and salt, and simmer over a gentle
fire for 5 minutes, occasionally stirring the contents. Dish the mince, split the feet, and
arrange them round alternately with sippets of toasted bread, and pour the gravy in the middle.

Time.--Altogether 40 minutes.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from September to March.

TO PICKLE PORK.

833. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of saltpetre; salt.

Mode.--As pork does not keep long without being salted, cut it into pieces of a suitable size
as soon as the pig is cold. Rub the pieces of pork well with salt, and put them into a pan
with a sprinkling of it between each piece: as it melts on the top, strew on more. Lay a coarse
cloth over the pan, a board over that, and a weight on the board, to keep the pork down in
the brine. If excluded from the air, it will continue good for nearly 2 years.

Average cost, 10d. per lb. for the prime parts.

Seasonable.--The best time for pickling meat is late in the autumn.

    THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE HOG.--A singular circumstance in the
    domestic history of the hog, is the extent of its distribution
    over the surface of the earth; being found even in insulated
    places, where the inhabitants are semi-barbarous, and where the
    wild species is entirely unknown. The South-Sea islands, for
    example, were found on their discovery to be well stocked with a
    small black hog; and the traditionary belief of the people was
    that these animals were coeval with the origin of themselves.
    Yet they possessed no knowledge of the wild boar, or any other
    animal of the hog kind, from which the domestic breed might be
    supposed to be derived. In these islands the hog is the
    principal quadruped, and the fruit of the bread-tree is its
    principal food, although it is also fed with yams, eddoes, and
    other vegetables. This nutritious diet, which it has in great
    abundance, is, according to Foster, the reason of its flesh
    being so delicious, so full of juice, and so rich in fat, which
    is not less delicate to the taste than the finest butter.

TO BOIL PICKLED PORK.

834. INGREDIENTS.--Pork; water.

Mode.--Should the pork be very salt, let it remain in water about 2 hours before it is dressed;
put it into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it, let it gradually come to a boil,
then gently simmer until quite tender. Allow ample time for it to cook, as nothing is more
disagreeable than underdone pork, and when boiled fast, the meat becomes hard. This is sometimes
served with boiled poultry and roast veal, instead of bacon: when tender, and not over salt,
it will be found equally good.

Time.--A piece of pickled pork weighing 2 lbs., 1-1/4 hour; 4 lbs., rather more than 2 hours.

Average cost, 10d. per lb. for the primest parts.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG.--By what nation and in what period the
    hog was reclaimed, is involved in the deepest obscurity. So far
    back as we have any records of history, we find notices of this
    animal, and of its flesh being used as the food of man. By some
    nations, however, its flesh was denounced as unclean, and
    therefore prohibited to be used, whilst by others it was
    esteemed as a great delicacy. By the Mosaic law it was forbidden
    to be eaten by the Jews, and the Mahometans hold it in utter
    abhorrence. Dr. Kitto, however, says that there does not appear
    to be any reason in the law of Moses why the hog should be held
    in such peculiar abomination. There seems nothing to have
    prevented the Jews, if they had been so inclined, to rear pigs
    for sale, or for the use of the land. In the Talmud there are
    some indications that this was actually done; and it was,
    probably, for such purposes that the herds of swine mentioned in
    the New Testament were kept, although it is usual to consider
    that they were kept by the foreign settlers in the land. Indeed,
    the story which accounts for the peculiar aversion of the
    Hebrews to the hog, assumes that it did not originate until
    about 130 years before Christ, and that, previously, some Jews
    were in the habit of rearing hogs for the purposes indicated.

PORK PIES (Warwickshire Recipe).

835. INGREDIENTS.--For the crust, 5 lbs. of lard to 14 lbs. of flour, milk, and water. For
filling the pies, to every 3 lbs. of meat allow 1 oz. of salt, 2-1/4 oz. of pepper, a small
quantity of cayenne, 1 pint of water.

Mode.--Rub into the flour a portion of the lard; the remainder put with sufficient milk and
water to mix the crust, and boil this gently for 1/4 hour. Pour it boiling on the flour, and
knead and beat it till perfectly smooth. Now raise the crust in either a round or oval form,
cut up the pork into pieces the size of a nut, season it in the above proportion, and press
it compactly into the pie, in alternate layers of fat and lean, and pour in a small quantity
of water; lay on the lid, cut the edges smoothly round, and pinch them together. Bake in a
brick oven, which should be slow, as the meat is very solid. Very frequently, the inexperienced
cook finds much difficulty in raising the crust. She should bear in mind that it must not be
allowed to get cold, or it will fall immediately: to prevent this, the operation should be
performed as near the fire as possible. As considerable dexterity and expertness are necessary
to raise the crust with the hand only, a glass bottle or small jar may be placed in the middle
of the paste, and the crust moulded on this; but be particular that it is kept warm the whole time.

Sufficient.--The proportions for 1 pie are 1 lb. of flour and 3 lbs. of meat.

Seasonable from September to March.

    THE FLESH OF SWINE IN HOT CLIMATES.--It is observed by M.
    Sonini, that the flesh of swine, in hot climates, is considered
    unwholesome, and therefore may account for its proscription by
    the legislators and priests of the East. In Egypt, Syria, and
    even the southern parts of Greece, although both white and
    delicate, it is so flabby and surcharged with fat, that it
    disagrees with the strongest stomachs. Abstinence from it in
    general was, therefore, indispensable to health under the
    burning suns of Egypt and Arabia. The Egyptians were permitted
    to eat it only once a year,--on the feast of the moon; and then
    they sacrificed a number of these animals to that planet. At
    other seasons, should any one even touch a hog, he was obliged
    immediately to plunge into the river Nile, as he stood, with his
    clothes on, in order to purify himself from the supposed
    contamination he had contracted by the touch.

LITTLE RAISED PORK PIES.

836. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of mutton suet, salt and white
pepper to taste, 4 lbs. of the neck of pork, 1 dessertspoonful of powdered sage.

Mode.--Well dry the flour, mince the suet, and put these with the butter into a saucepan, to
be made hot, and add a little salt. When melted, mix it up into a stiff paste, and put it before
the fire with a cloth over it until ready to make up; chop the pork into small pieces, season
it with white pepper, salt, and powdered sage; divide the paste into rather small pieces, raise
it in a round or oval form, fill with the meat, and bake in a brick oven. These pies will require
a fiercer oven than those in the preceding recipe, as they are made so much smaller, and consequently
do not require so soaking a heat.

Time.--If made small, about 1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable from September to March.

    SWINEHERDS OF ANTIQUITY.--From the prejudice against the hog
    among the ancients, those who tended them formed an isolated
    class, and were esteemed as the outcasts of society. However
    much the flesh of the animal was esteemed by the Greeks and
    Romans, yet the swineherd is not mentioned by either the classic
    writers or the poets who, in ancient Greece and Rome, painted
    rural life. We have no descriptions of gods or heroes descending
    to the occupation of keeping swine. The swineherd is never
    introduced into the idyls of Theocritus, nor has Virgil admitted
    him into his eclogues. The Eumaeus of Homer is the only
    exception that we have of a swineherd meeting with favour in the
    eyes of a poet of antiquity. This may be accounted for, on the
    supposition that the prejudices of the Egyptians relative to
    this class of men, extended to both Greece and Italy, and
    imparted a bias to popular opinion.

TO MAKE SAUSAGES.

(Author's Oxford Recipe.)

837. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of pork, fat and lean, without skin or gristle; 1 lb. of lean veal,
1 lb. of beef suet, 1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 1 small nutmeg, 6 sage-leaves,
1 teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of savory, 1/2 teaspoonful
of marjoram.

Mode.--Chop the pork, veal, and suet finely together, add the bread crumbs, lemon-peel (which
should be well minced), and a small nutmeg grated. Wash and chop the sage-leaves very finely;
add these with the remaining ingredients to the sausage-meat, and when thoroughly mixed, either
put the meat into skins, or, when wanted for table, form it into little cakes, which should
be floured and fried.

Average cost, for this quantity, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient for about 30 moderate-sized sausages.

Seasonable from October to March.

    THE HOG IN ENGLAND.--From time immemorial, in England, this
    animal has been esteemed as of the highest importance. In the
    Anglo-Saxon period, vast herds of swine were tended by men, who
    watched over their safety, and who collected them under shelter
    at night. At that time, the flesh of the animal was the staple
    article of consumption in every family, and a large portion of
    the wealth of the rich freemen of the country consisted of these
    animals. Hence it was common to make bequests of swine, with
    lands for their support; and to these were attached rights and
    privileges in connection with their feeding, and the extent of
    woodland to be occupied by a given number was granted in
    accordance with established rules. This is proved by an ancient
    Saxon grant, quoted by Sharon Turner, in his "History of the
    Anglo-Saxons," where the right of pasturage is conveyed in a
    deed by the following words:--"I give food for seventy swine in
    that woody allotment which the countrymen call Wolferdinlegh."

FRIED SAUSAGES.

838. INGREDIENTS.--Sausages; a small piece of butter.

Mode.--Prick the sausages with a fork (this prevents them from bursting), and put them into
a frying-pan with a small piece of butter. Keep moving the pan about, and turn the sausages
3 or 4 times. In from 10 to 12 minutes they will be sufficiently cooked, unless they are very
large, when a little more time should be allowed for them. Dish them with or without a piece
of toast under them, and serve very hot. In some counties, sausages are boiled and served on
toast. They should be plunged into boiling water, and simmered for about 10 or 12 minutes.

Time.--10 to 12 minutes.

Average cost, 10d. per lb.

Seasonable.--Good from September to March.

Note.--Sometimes, in close warm weather, sausages very soon turn sour; to prevent this, put
them in the oven for a few minutes with a small piece of butter to keep them moist. When wanted
for table, they will not require so long frying as uncooked sausages.

    THE SAXON SWINEHERD.--The men employed in herding swine during
    the Anglo-Saxon period of our history were, in general, thralls
    or born slaves of the soil, who were assisted by powerful dogs,
    capable even of singly contending with the wolf until his master
    came with his spear to the rescue. In the "Ivanhoe" of Sir
    Walter Scott, we have an admirable picture, in the character of
    Gurth, an Anglo-Saxon swineherd, as we also have of his master,
    a large landed proprietor, a great portion of whose wealth
    consisted of swine, and whose rude but plentiful board was
    liberally supplied with the flesh.

SAUSAGE-MEAT CAKES.

839. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of lean pork, add 3/4 lb. of fat bacon, 1/4 oz. of salt, 1
saltspoonful of pepper, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley.

Mode.--Remove from the pork all skin, gristle, and bone, and chop it finely with the bacon;
add the remaining ingredients, and carefully mix altogether. Pound it well in a mortar, make
it into convenient-sized cakes, flour these, and fry them a nice brown for about 10 minutes.
This is a very simple method of making sausage-meat, and on trial will prove very good, its
great recommendation being, that it is so easily made.

Time.--10 minutes.

Seasonable from September to March.

TO SCALD A SUCKING-PIG.

840. Put the pig into cold water directly it is killed; let it remain for a few minutes, then
immerse it in a large pan of boiling water for 2 minutes. Take it out, lay it on a table, and
pull off the hair as quickly as possible. When the skin looks clean, make a slit down the belly,
take out the entrails, well clean the nostrils and ears, wash the pig in cold water, and wipe
it thoroughly dry. Take off the feet at the first joint, and loosen and leave sufficient skin
to turn neatly over. If not to be dressed immediately, fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from
the air.

    THE LEARNED PIG.--That the pig is capable of education, is a
    fact long known to the world; and though, like the ass,
    naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable
    with other animals to caresses and kindness, has been shown from
    very remote time; the best modern evidence of his docility,
    however, is the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited
    about a century since, but which has been continued down to our
    own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put
    together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month,
    hour, and date of the exhibition, besides many other
    unquestioned evidences of memory. The instance already given of
    breaking a sow into a pointer, till she became more stanch even
    than the dog itself, though surprising, is far less wonderful
    than that evidence of education where so generally obtuse an
    animal may be taught not only to spell, but couple figures and
    give dates correctly.

ROAST SUCKING-PIG.

841. After preparing the pig for cooking, as in the preceding recipe, stuff it with finely-grated
bread crumbs, minced sage, pepper, salt, and a piece of butter the size of an egg, all of which
should be well mixed together, and put into the body of the pig. Sew up the slit neatly, and
truss the legs back, to allow the inside to be roasted, and the under part to be crisp. Put
the pig down to a bright clear fire, not too near, and let it lay till thoroughly dry; then
have ready some butter tied up in a piece of thin cloth, and rub the pig with this in every
part. Keep it well rubbed with the butter the whole of the time it is roasting, and do not
allow the crackling to become blistered or burnt. When half-done, hang a pig-iron before the
middle part (if this is not obtainable, use a flat iron), to prevent its being scorched and
dried up before the ends are done. Before it is taken from the fire, cut off the head, and
part that and the body down the middle. Chop the brains and mix them with the stuffing; add
1/2 pint of good gravy, a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and the gravy that flowed from the
pig; put a little of this on the dish with the pig, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.
Place the pig back to back in the dish, with one half of the head on each side, and one of
the ears at each end, and send it to table as hot as possible. Instead of butter, many cooks
take salad oil for basting, which makes the crackling crisp; and as this is one of the principal
things to be considered, perhaps it is desirable to use it; but be particular that it is very
pure, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour to the meat. The brains and stuffing may be stirred
into a tureen of melted butter instead of gravy, when the latter is not liked. Apple sauce
and the old-fashioned currant sauce are not yet quite obsolete as an accompaniment to roast pig.

Time.--1-1/2 to 2 hours for a small pig.

Average cost, 5s. to 6s.

Sufficient for 9 or 10 persons.

Seasonable from September to February.

    HOW ROAST PIG WAS DISCOVERED.--Charles Lamb, who, in the early
    part of this century, delighted the reading public by his quaint
    prose sketches, written under the title of "Essays of Elia,"
    has, in his own quiet humorous way, devoted one paper to the
    subject of Roast Pig, and more especially to that luxurious
    and toothsome dainty known as "CRACKLING;" and shows, in a
    manner peculiarly his own, how crackling first came into the
    world.

    According to this erudite authority, man in the golden age, or
    at all events the primitive age, eat his pork and bacon raw, as,
    indeed, he did his beef and mutton; unless, as Hudibras tells
    us, he was an epicure, when he used to make a saddle of his
    saddle of mutton, and after spreading it on his horse's back,
    and riding on it for a few hours till thoroughly warmed, he sat
    down to the luxury of a dish cooked to a turn. At the epoch of
    the story, however, a citizen of some Scythian community had the
    misfortune to have his hut, or that portion of it containing his
    live stock of pigs, burnt down. In going over the débris on
    the following day, and picking out all the available salvage,
    the proprietor touched something unusually or unexpectedly hot,
    which caused him to shake his hand with great energy, and clap
    the tips of his suffering fingers to his mouth. The act was
    simple and natural, but the result was wonderful. He rolled his
    eyes in ecstatic pleasure, his frame distended, and, conscious
    of a celestial odour, his nostrils widened, and, while drawing
    in deep inspirations of the ravishing perfume, he sucked his
    fingers with a gusto he had never, in his most hungry moments,
    conceived. Clearing away the rubbish from beneath him, he at
    last brought to view the carcase of one of his pigs, roasted to
    death. Stooping down to examine this curious object, and
    touching its body, a fragment of the burnt skin was detached,
    which, with a sort of superstitious dread, he at length, and in
    a spirit of philosophical inquiry, put into his mouth. Ye gods!
    the felicity he then enjoyed, no pen can chronicle! Then it was
    that he--the world--first tasted crackling. Like a miser with
    his gold, the Scythian hid his treasure from the prying eyes of
    the world, and feasted, in secret, more sumptuously than the
    gods. When he had eaten up all his pig, the poor man fell into a
    melancholy; he refused the most tempting steak, though cooked on
    the horse's back, and turned every half-hour after his own
    favourite recipe; he fell, in fact, from his appetite, and was
    reduced to a shadow, till, unable longer to endure the torments
    of memory he hourly suffered, he rose one night and secretly set
    fire to his hut, and once more was restored to flesh and
    manhood. Finding it impossible to live in future without
    roast-pig, he set fire to his house every time his larder became
    empty; till at last his neighbours, scandalized by the frequency
    of these incendiary acts, brought his conduct before the supreme
    council of the nation. To avert the penalty that awaited him, he
    brought his judges to the smouldering ruins, and discovering the
    secret, invited them to eat; which having done, with tears of
    gratitude, the august synod embraced him, and, with an
    overflowing feeling of ecstasy, dedicated a statue to the memory
    of the man who first instituted roast pork.

PORK CARVING.

SUCKING-PIG.

842. A sucking-pig seems, at first sight, rather an elaborate dish, or rather animal, to carve;
but by carefully mastering the details of the business, every difficulty will vanish; and if
a partial failure be at first made, yet all embarrassment will quickly disappear on a second
trial. A sucking-pig is usually sent to table in the manner shown in the engraving (and also
in coloured plate S), and the first point to be attended to is to separate the shoulder from
the carcase, by carrying the knife quickly and neatly round the circular line, as shown by
the figures 1, 2, 3;--the shoulder will then easily come away. The next step is to take off
the leg; and this is done in the same way, by cutting round this joint in the direction shown
by the figures 1, 2, 3, in the same way as the shoulder. The ribs then stand fairly open to
the knife, which should be carried down in the direction of the line 4 to 5; and two or three
helpings will dispose of these. The other half of the pig is served, of course, in the same
manner. Different parts of the pig are variously esteemed; some preferring the flesh of the
neck; others, the ribs; and others, again, the shoulders. The truth is, the whole of a sucking-pig
is delicious, delicate eating; but, in carving it, the host should consult the various tastes
and fancies of his guests, keeping the larger joints, generally, for the gentlemen of the party.

HAM.

843. In cutting a ham, the carver must be guided according as he desires to practise economy,
or have, at once, fine slices out of the prime part. Under the first supposition, he will commence
at the knuckle end, and cut off thin slices towards the thick part of the ham. To reach the
choicer portion, the knife, which must be very sharp and thin, should be carried quite down
to the bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2. The slices should be thin and even, and always
cut down to the bone. There are some who like to carve a ham by cutting a hole at the top,
and then slicing pieces off inside the hole, gradually enlarging the circle; but we think this
a plan not to be recommended. A ham, when hot, is usually sent to table with a paper ruffle
round the knuckle; when cold, it is served in the manner shown by coloured plate P.

LEG OF PORK.

844. This joint, which is such a favourite one with many people, is easy to carve. The knife
should be carried sharply down to the bone, clean through the crackling, in the direction of
the line 1 to 2. Sago and onion and apple sauce are usually sent to table with this dish,--sometimes
the leg of pork is stuffed,--and the guests should be asked if they will have either or both.
A frequent plan, and we think a good one, is now pursued, of sending sage and onion to table
separately from the joint, as it is not everybody to whom the flavour of this stuffing is agreeable.

Note.--The other dishes of pork do not call for any special remarks as to their carving or helping.

CHAPTER XVIII.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE CALF.

845. ANY REMARKS MADE ON THE CALF OR THE LAMB must naturally be in a measure supplementary
to the more copious observations made on the parent stock of either. As the calf, at least
as far as it is identified with veal, is destined to die young,--to be, indeed, cut off in
its comparative infancy,--it may, at first sight, appear of little or no consequence to inquire
to what particular variety, or breed of the general stock, his sire or dam may belong. The
great art, however, in the modern science of husbandry has been to obtain an animal that shall
not only have the utmost beauty of form of which the species is capable, but, at the same time,
a constitution free from all taint, a frame that shall rapidly attain bulk and stature, and
a disposition so kindly that every quantum of food it takes shall, without drawback or procrastination,
be eliminated into fat and muscle. The breed, then, is of very considerable consequence in
determining, not only the quality of the meat to the consumer, but its commercial value to
the breeder and butcher.

846. UNDER THE ARTIFICIAL SYSTEM adopted in the rearing of domestic cattle, and stock in general,
to gratify the arbitrary mandates of luxury and fashion, we can have veal, like lamb, at all
seasons in the market, though the usual time in the metropolis for veal to make its appearance
is about the beginning of February.

847. THE COW GOES WITH YOUNG FOR NINE MONTHS, and the affection and solicitude she evinces
for her offspring is more human in its tenderness mid intensity than is displayed by any other
animal; and her distress when she hears its bleating, and is not allowed to reach it with her
distended udders, is often painful to witness, and when the calf has died, or been accidentally
killed, her grief frequently makes her refuse to give down her milk. At such times, the breeder
has adopted the expedient of flaying the dead carcase, and, distending the skin with hay, lays
the effigy before her, and then taking advantage of her solicitude, milks her while she is
caressing the skin with her tongue.

848. IN A STATE OF NATURE, the cow, like the deer, hides her young in the tall ferns and brakes,
and the most secret places; and only at stated times, twice or thrice a day, quits the herd,
and, hastening to the secret cover, gives suck to her calf, and with the same, circumspection
returns to the community.

849. IN SOME COUNTRIES, to please the epicurean taste of vitiated appetites, it is the custom
to kill the calf for food almost immediately after birth, and any accident that forestalls
that event, is considered to enhance its value. We are happy to say, however, that in this
country, as far as England and Scotland are concerned, the taste for very young veal has entirely
gone out, and "Staggering Bob," as the poor little animal was called in the language of the
shambles, is no longer to be met with in such a place.

850. THE WEANING OF CALVES is a process that requires a great amount of care and judgment;
for though they are in reality not weaned till between the eighth and the twelfth week, the
process of rearing them by hand commences in fact from the birth, the calf never being allowed
to suck its dam. As the rearing of calves for the market is a very important and lucrative
business, the breeder generally arranges his stock so that ten or a dozen of his cows shall
calve about the same time; and then, by setting aside one or two, to find food for the entire
family, gets the remaining eight or ten with their full fountains of milk, to carry on the
operations of his dairy. Some people have an idea that skimmed milk, if given in sufficient
quantity, is good enough for the weaning period of calf-feeding; but this is a very serious
mistake, for the cream, of which it has been deprived, contained nearly all the oleaginous
principles, and the azote or nitrogen, on which the vivifying properties of that fluid depends.
Indeed, so remarkably correct has this fact proved to be, that a calf reared on one part of
new milk mixed with five of water, will thrive and look well; while another, treated with unlimited
skimmed milk, will be poor, thin, and miserable.

851. IT IS SOMETIMES A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE to induce the blundering calf--whose
instinct only teaches him to suck, and that he will do at anything and with anything--acquire
the knowledge of imbibition, that for the first few days it is often necessary to fill a bottle
with milk, and, opening his mouth, pour the contents down his throat. The manner, however,
by which he is finally educated into the mystery of suction, is by putting his allowance of
milk into a large wooden bowl; the nurse then puts her hand into the milk, and, by bending
her fingers upwards, makes a rude teat for the calf to grasp in his lips, when the vacuum caused
by his suction of the fingers, causes the milk to rise along them into his mouth. In this manner
one by one the whole family are to be fed three times a day; care being taken, that new-born
calves are not, at first, fed on milk from a cow who has some days calved.

852. AS THE CALF PROGRESSES TOWARDS HIS TENTH WEEK, his diet requires to be increased in quantity
and quality; for these objects, his milk can be thickened with flour or meal, and small pieces
of softened oil-cake are to be slipped into his mouth after sucking, that they may dissolve
there, till he grows familiar with, and to like the taste, when it may be softened and scraped
down into his milk-and-water. After a time, sliced turnips softened by steam are to be given
to him in tolerable quantities; then succulent grasses; and finally, hay may be added to the
others. Some farmers, desirous of rendering their calves fat for the butcher in as short a
time as possible, forget both the natural weakness of the digestive powers, and the contracted
volume of the stomach, and allow the animals either to suck ad libitum, or give them, if brought
up at the pail or by hand, a larger quantity of milk than they can digest. The idea of overloading
the stomach never suggests itself to their minds. They suppose that the more food the young
creature consumes, the sooner it will be fat, and they allow it no exercise whatever, for fear
it should denude its very bones of their flesh. Under such circumstances, the stomach soon
becomes deranged; its functions are no longer capable of acting; the milk, subjected to the
acid of the stomach, coagulates, and forms a hardened mass of curd, when the muscles become
affected with spasms, and death frequently ensues.

853. THERE WAS NO SPECIES OF SLAUGHTERING practised in this country so inhuman and disgraceful
as that, till very lately, employed in killing this poor animal; when, under the plea of making
the flesh white, the calf was bled day by day, till, when the final hour came, the animal was
unable to stand. This inhumanity is, we believe, now everywhere abolished, and the calf is
at once killed, and with the least amount of pain; a sharp-pointed knife is run through the
neck, severing all the large veins and arteries up to the vertebrae. The skin is then taken
off to the knee, which is disjointed, and to the head, which is removed; it is then reflected
backwards, and the carcase having been opened and dressed, is kept apart by stretchers, and
the thin membrane, the caul, extended over the organs left in the carcase, as the kidneys and
sweet-bread; some melted fat is then scattered suddenly over the whole interior, giving that
white and frosted appearance to the meat, that is thought to add to its beauty; the whole is
then hung up to cool and harden.

854. THE MANNER OF CUTTING UP VEAL for the English market is to divide the carcase into four
quarters, with eleven ribs to each fore quarter; which are again subdivided into joints as
exemplified on the cut.

  Hind quarter:--

    1. The loin.
    2. The chump, consisting of the rump
        and hock-bone.
    3. The fillet.
    4. The hock, or hind knuckle.

  Fore quarter:--

    5. The shoulder.
    6. The neck.
    7. The breast.
    8. The fore knuckle.

855. THE SEVERAL PARTS OF A MODERATELY-SIZED WELL-FED CALF, about eight weeks old, are nearly
of the following weights:--loin and chump 18 lbs., fillet 12-1/2 lbs., hind knuckle 5-1/2 lbs.,
shoulder 11 lbs, neck 11 lbs., breast 9 lbs., and fore knuckle 5 lbs.; making a total of 144
lbs. weight. The London mode of cutting the carcase is considered better than that pursued
in Edinburgh, as giving three roasting joints, and one boiling, in each quarter; besides the
pieces being more equally divided, as regards flesh, and from the handsomer appearance they
make on the table.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XIX.

BAKED VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery).

856. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of cold roast veal, a few slices of bacon, 1 pint of bread crumbs,
1/2 pint of good veal gravy, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 blade of pounded mace,
cayenne and salt to taste, 4 eggs.

Mode.--Mince finely the veal and bacon; add the bread crumbs, gravy, and seasoning, and stir
these ingredients well together. Beat up the eggs thoroughly; add these, mix the whole well
together, put into a dish, and bake from 3/4 to 1 hour. When liked, a little good gravy may
be served in a tureen as an accompaniment.

Time.--From 3/4 to 1 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, 6d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

ROAST BREAST OF VEAL.

857. INGREDIENTS.--Veal; a little flour.

Mode.--Wash the veal, well wipe it, and dredge it with flour; put it down to a bright fire,
not too near, as it should not be scorched. Baste it plentifully until done; dish it, pour
over the meat some good melted butter, and send to table with it a piece of boiled bacon and
a cut lemon.

Seasonable from March to October.

STEWED BREAST OF VEAL AND PEAS.

858. INGREDIENTS.--Breast of veal, 2 oz. of butter, a bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley;
2 blades of pounded mace, 2 cloves, 5 or 6 young onions, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 6 allspice,
1/4 teaspoonful of pepper, 1 teaspoonful of salt, thickening of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls
of sherry, 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls
of mushroom ketchup, green peas.

Mode.--Cut the breast in half, after removing the bone underneath, and divide the meat into
convenient-sized pieces. Put the butter into a frying-pan, lay in the pieces of veal, and fry
until of a nice brown colour. Now place these in a stewpan with the herbs, mace, cloves, onions,
lemon-peel, allspice, and seasoning; pour over them just sufficient boiling water to cover
the meat; well close the lid, and let the whole simmer very gently for about 2 hours. Strain
off as much gravy as is required, thicken it with butter and flour, add the remaining ingredients,
skim well, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then pour it over the meat. Have ready some
green peas, boiled separately; sprinkle these over the veal, and serve. It may be garnished
with forcemeat balls, or rashers of bacon curled and fried. Instead of cutting up the meat,
many persons prefer it dressed whole;--in that case it should be half-roasted before the water,
&c. are put to it.

    BREEDING OF CALVES.--The forwarding of calves to maturity,
    whether intended to be reared for stock, or brought to an early
    market as veal, is always a subject of great importance, and
    requires a considerable amount of intelligence in the selection
    of the best course, to adopt for either end. When meant to be
    reared as stock, the breeding should be so arranged that the cow
    shall calve about the middle of May. As our subject, however,
    has more immediate reference to the calf as meat than as
    stock, we shall confine our remarks to the mode of procedure
    adopted in the former case; and here, the first process adopted
    is that of weaning; which consists in separating the calf
    entirely from the cow, but, at the same time, rearing it on
    the mother's milk. As the business of the dairy would be
    suspended if every cow were allowed to rear its young, and
    butter, cheese, and cream become desiderata,--things to be
    desired, but not possessed, a system of economical husbandry
    becomes necessary, so as to retain our dairy produce, and yet,
    for some weeks at least, nourish the calf on its mother's milk,
    but without allowing the animal to draw that supply for itself:
    this, with the proper substituted food on which to rear the
    young animal, is called weaning.

VEAL CAKE (a Convenient Dish for a Picnic).

859. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold roast veal, a few slices of cold ham, 2 hard-boiled
eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, a little pepper, good gravy.

Mode.--Cut off all the brown outside from the veal, and cut the eggs into slices. Procure a
pretty mould; lay veal, ham, eggs, and parsley in layers, with a little pepper between each,
and when the mould is full, get some strong stock, and fill up the shape. Bake for 1/2 hour,
and when cold, turn it out.

Time.--1/2 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

BOILED CALF'S FEET AND PARSLEY AND BUTTER.

860. INGREDIENTS.--2 calf's feet, 2 slices of bacon, 2 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice,
salt and whole pepper to taste, 1 onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, 4 cloves, 1 blade of mace,
water, parsley and butter No. 493.

Mode.--Procure 2 white calf's feet; bone them as far as the first joint, and put them into
warm water to soak for 2 hours. Then put the bacon, butter, lemon-juice, onion, herbs, spices,
and seasoning into a stewpan; lay in the feet, and pour in just sufficient water to cover the
whole. Stew gently for about 3 hours; take out the feet, dish them, and cover with parsley
and butter, made by recipe No. 493. The liquor they were boiled in should be strained and put
by in a clean basin for use: it will be found very good as an addition to gravies, &c. &c.

Time.--Rather more than 3 hours.

Average cost, in full season, 9d. each. Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

    WHEN A CALF SHOULD BE KILLED.--The age at which a calf ought to
    be killed should not be under four weeks: before that time the
    flesh is certainly not wholesome, wanting firmness, due
    development of muscular fibre, and those animal juices on which
    the flavour and nutritive properties of the flesh depend,
    whatever the unhealthy palate of epicures may deem to the
    contrary. In France, a law exists to prevent the slaughtering of
    calves under six weeks of age. The calf is considered in prime
    condition at ten weeks, when he will weigh from sixteen to
    eighteen stone, and sometimes even twenty.

FRICASSEED CALF'S FEET.

861. INGREDIENTS.--A set of calf's feet; for the batter allow for each egg 1 tablespoonful
of flour, 1 tablespoonful of bread crumbs, hot lard or clarified dripping, pepper and salt
to taste.

Mode.--If the feet are purchased uncleaned, dip them into warm water repeatedly, and scrape
off the hair, first one foot and then the other, until the skin looks perfectly clean, a saucepan
of water being kept by the fire until they are finished. After washing and soaking in cold
water, boil them in just sufficient water to cover them, until the bones come easily away.
Then pick them out, and after straining the liquor into a clean vessel, put the meat into a
pie-dish until the next day. Now cut it down in slices about 1/2 inch thick, lay on them a
stiff batter made of egg, flour, and bread crumbs in the above proportion; season with pepper
and salt, and plunge them into a pan of boiling lard. Fry the slices a nice brown, dry them
before the fire for a minute or two, dish them on a napkin, and garnish with tufts of parsley.
This should be eaten with melted butter, mustard, and vinegar. Be careful to have the lard
boiling to set the batter, or the pieces of feet will run about the pan. The liquor they were
boiled in should be saved, and will be found useful for enriching gravies, making jellies, &e. &e.

Time.--About 3 hours to stew the feet, 10 or 15 minutes to fry them.

Average cost, in full season, 9d. each.

Sufficient for 8 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

Note.--This dish can be highly recommended to delicate persons.

    COLOUR OF VEAL.--As whiteness of flesh is considered a great
    advantage in veal, butchers, in the selection of their calves,
    are in the habit of examining the inside of its mouth, and
    noting the colour of the calf's eyes; alleging that, from the
    signs they there see, they can prognosticate whether the veal
    will be white or florid.

COLLARED CALF'S HEAD.

862. INGREDIENTS.--A calf's head, 4 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, 4 blades of pounded mace,
1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, white pepper to taste, a few thick slices of ham, the yolks
of 6 eggs boiled hard.

Mode.--Scald the head for a few minutes; take it out of the water, and with a blunt knife scrape
off all the hair. Clean it nicely, divide the head and remove the brains. Boil it tender enough
to take out the bones, which will be in about 2 hours. When the head is boned, flatten it on
the table, sprinkle over it a thick layer of parsley, then a layer of ham, and then the yolks
of the eggs cut into thin rings and put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, and white pepper
between each layer; roll the head up in a cloth, and tie it up as tightly as possible. Boil
it for 4 hours, and when it is taken out of the pot, place a heavy weight on the top, the same
as for other collars. Let it remain till cold; then remove the cloth and binding, and it will
be ready to serve.

Time.--Altogether 6 hours. Average cost, 5s. to 7s. each.

Seasonable from March to October.

    FEEDING A CALF.--The amount of milk necessary for a calf for
    some time, will be about four quarts a day, though, after the
    first fortnight, that quantity should be gradually increased,
    according to its development of body, when, if fed exclusively
    on milk, as much as three gallons a day will be requisite for
    the due health and requirements of the animal. If the weather
    is fine and genial, it should be turned into an orchard or small
    paddock for a few hours each day, to give it an opportunity to
    acquire a relish for the fresh pasture, which, by the tenth or
    twelfth week, it will begin to nibble and enjoy. After a certain
    time, the quantity of milk may be diminished, and its place
    supplied by water thickened with meal. Hay-tea and linseed-jelly
    are also highly nutritious substances, and may be used either as
    adjuncts or substitutes.

FRICASSEED CALF'S HEAD (an Entree).

863. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a boiled calf's head, 1-1/2 pint of the liquor in which the
head was boiled, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 onion minced, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and
white pepper to taste, thickening of butter and flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon-juice, forcemeat balls.

Mode.--Remove all the bones from the head, and cut the meat into nice square pieces. Put 1-1/2
pint of the liquor it was boiled in into a saucepan, with mace, onion, herbs, and seasoning
in the above proportion; let this simmer gently for 3/4 hour, then strain it and put in the
meat. When quite hot through, thicken the gravy with a little butter rolled in flour, and,
just before dishing the fricassee, put in the beaten yolks of eggs and lemon-juice; but be
particular, after these two latter ingredients are added, that the sauce does not boil, or
it will curdle. Garnish with forcemeat balls and curled slices of broiled bacon. To insure
the sauce being smooth, it is a good plan to dish the meat first, and then to add the eggs
to the gravy: when these are set, the sauce may be poured over the meat.

Time.--Altogether, 1-1/4 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 6d.

CALF'S HEAD a la Maitre d'Hotel.

864. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a cold calf's head, rather more than 1/2 pint of Maitre d'hôtel
sauce No. 466.

Mode.--Make the sauce by recipe No. 466, and have it sufficiently thick that it may nicely
cover the meat; remove the bones from the head, and cut the meat into neat slices. 2d.

Seasonable from March to October.

    THE CALF IN AMERICA.--In America, the calf is left with the
    mother for three or four days, when it is removed, and at once
    fed on barley and oats ground together and made into a gruel, 1
    quart of the meal being boiled for half an hour in 12 quarts of
    water. One quart of this certainly nutritious gruel, is to be
    given, lukewarm, morning and evening. In ten days, a bundle of
    soft hay is put beside the calf, which he soon begins to eat,
    and, at the same time, some of the dry meal is placed in his
    manger for him to lick. This process, gradually increasing the
    quantity of gruel twice a day, is continued for two months, till
    the calf is fit to go to grass, and, as it is said, with the
    best possible success. But, in this country, the mode pointed
    out in No. 862 has received the sanction of the best experience.

CURRIED VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery).

865. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast veal, 4 onions, 2 apples sliced, 1 tablespoonful
of curry-powder, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of broth or water, 1 tablespoonful of
lemon-juice.

Mode.--Slice the onions and apples, and fry them in a little butter; then take them out, cut
the meat into neat cutlets, and fry these of a pale brown; add the curry-powder and flour,
put in the onion, apples, and a little broth or water, and stew gently till quite tender; add
the lemon-juice, and serve with an edging of boiled rice. The curry may be ornamented with
pickles, capsicums, and gherkins arranged prettily on the top.

VEAL CUTLETS (an Entree).

866. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the prime part of the leg of veal, egg and bread crumbs,
3 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs, salt and popper to taste, a small piece of butter.

Mode.--Have the veal cut into slices about 3/4 of an inch in thickness, and, if not cut perfectly
even, level the meat with a cutlet-bat or rolling-pin. Shape and trim the cutlets, and brush
them over with egg. Sprinkle with bread crumbs, with which have been mixed minced herbs and
a seasoning of pepper and salt, and press the crumbs down. Fry them of a delicate brown in
fresh lard or butter, and be careful not to burn them. They should be very thoroughly done,
but not dry. If the cutlets be thick, keep the pan covered for a few minutes at a good distance
from the fire, after they have acquired a good colour: by this means, the meat will be done
through. Lay the cutlets in a dish, keep them hot, and make a gravy in the pan as follows:
Dredge in a little flour, add a piece of butter the size of a walnut, brown it, then pour as
much boiling water as is required over it, season with pepper and salt, add a little lemon-juice,
give one boil, and pour it over the cutlets. They should be garnished with slices of broiled
bacon, and a few forcemeat balls will be found a very excellent addition to this dish.

Time.--For cutlets of a moderate thickness, about 12 minutes; if very thick, allow more time.

Average cost, 10d. per lb. Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

Note.--Veal cutlets may be merely floured and fried of a nice brown; the gravy and garnishing
should be the same as in the preceding recipe. They may also be cut from the loin or neck,
as shown in the engraving.

BROILED VEAL CUTLETS a l'Italienne (an Entree).

867. INGREDIENTS.--Neck of veal, salt and pepper to taste, the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs,
1/2 pint of Italian sauce No. 453.

Mode.--Cut the veal into cutlets, flatten and trim them nicely; powder over them a little salt
and pepper; brush them over with the yolk of an egg, dip them into bread crumbs, then into
clarified butter, and, afterwards, in the bread crumbs again; broil or fry them over a clear
fire, that they may acquire a good brown colour. Arrange them in the dish alternately with
rashers of broiled ham, and pour the sauce, made by recipe No. 453, in the middle.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes, according to the thickness of the cutlets.

Average cost, 10d. per lb.

Seasonable from March to October.

    THE CALF'S-HEAD CLUB.--When the restoration of Charles II. took
    the strait waistcoat off the minds and morose religion of the
    Commonwealth period, and gave a loose rein to the
    long-compressed spirits of the people, there still remained a
    large section of society wedded to the former state of things.
    The elders of this party retired from public sight, where,
    unoffended by the reigning saturnalia, they might dream in
    seclusion over their departed Utopia. The young bloods of this
    school, however, who were compelled to mingle in the world, yet
    detesting the politics which had become the fashion, adopted a
    novel expedient to keep alive their republican sentiments, and
    mark their contempt of the reigning family. They accordingly
    met, in considerable numbers, at some convenient inn, on the
    30th of January in each year,--the anniversary of Charles's
    death, and dined together off a feast prepared from calves'
    heads, dressed in every possible variety of way, and with an
    abundance of wine drank toasts of defiance and hatred to the
    house of Stuart, and glory to the memory of old Holl Cromwell;
    and having lighted a large bonfire in the yard, the club of fast
    young Puritans, with their white handkerchiefs stained red in
    wine, and one of the party in a mask, bearing an axe, followed
    by the chairman, carrying a calf's head pinned up in a napkin,
    marched in mock procession to the bonfire, into which, with
    great shouts and uproar, they flung the enveloped head. This odd
    custom was continued for some time, and even down to the early
    part of this century it was customary for men of republican
    politics always to dine off calf's head on the 30th of January.

VEAL CUTLETS a la Maintenon (an Entree).

868. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 lbs. of veal cutlets, egg and bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced
savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, a little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Cut the cutlets about 3/4 inch in thickness, flatten them, and brush them over with
the yolk of an egg; dip them into bread crumbs and minced herbs, season with pepper and salt
and grated nutmeg, and fold each cutlet in a piece of buttered paper. Broil them, and send
them to table with melted butter or a good gravy.

Time.--From 15 to 18 minutes.

VEAL A LA BOURGEOISE.

(Excellent.)

869. INGREDIENTS.--2 to 3 lbs. of the loin or neck of veal, 10 or 12 young carrots, a bunch
of green onions, 2 slices of lean bacon, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 bunch of savoury herbs,
pepper and salt to taste, a few new potatoes, 1 pint of green peas.

Mode.--Cut the veal into cutlets, trim them, and put the trimmings into a stewpan with a little
butter; lay in the cutlets and fry them a nice brown colour on both sides. Add the bacon, carrots,
onions, spice, herbs, and seasoning; pour in about a pint of boiling water, and stew gently
for 2 hours on a very slow fire. When done, skim off the fat, take out the herbs, and flavour
the gravy with a little tomato sauce and ketchup. Have ready the peas and potatoes, boiled
separately; put them with the veal, and serve.

Time.--2 hours.

SCOTCH COLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery).

870. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast veal, a little butter, flour, 1/2 pint of water,
1 onion, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 teaspoonful of finely-minced
lemon-peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.

Mode.--Cut the veal the same thickness as for cutlets, rather larger than a crown-piece; flour
the meat well, and fry a light brown in butter; dredge again with flour, and add 1/2 pint of
water, pouring it in by degrees; set it on the fire, and when it boils, add the onion and mace,
and let it simmer very gently about 3/4 hour; flavour the gravy with lemon-juice, peel, wine,
and ketchup, in the above proportion; give one boil, and serve.

Time.--3/4 hour.

Seasonable from March to October.

SCOTCH COLLOPS, WHITE (Cold Meat Cookery).

871. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast veal, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 2 blades
of pounded mace, cayenne and salt to taste, a little butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/4
pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful
of lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 tablespoonful
of sherry.

Mode.--Cut the veal into thin slices about 3 inches in width; hack them with a knife, and grate
on them the nutmeg, mace, cayenne, and salt, and fry them in a little butter. Dish them, and
make a gravy in the pan by putting in the remaining ingredients. Give one boil, and pour it
over the collops; garnish with lemon and slices of toasted bacon, rolled. Forcemeat balls may
be added to this dish. If cream is not at hand, substitute the yolk of an egg beaten up well
with a little milk.

Time.--About 5 or 7 minutes.

Seasonable from May to October.

    COOKING COLLOPS.--Dean Ramsay, who tells us, in his
    "Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character," a number of
    famous stories of the strong-headed, warm-hearted, and
    plain-spoken old dames of the north, gives, amongst them, the
    following:--A strong-minded lady of this class was inquiring the
    character of a cook she was about to hire. The lady who was
    giving the character entered a little upon the cook's moral
    qualifications, and described her as a very decent woman; to
    which the astounding reply--this was 60 years ago, and a Dean
    tells the story--"Oh, d--n her decency; can she make good
    collops?"

ROAST FILLET OF VEAL.

872. INGREDIENTS.--Veal, forcemeat No. 417, melted butter.

Mode.--Have the fillet cut according to the size required; take out the bone, and after raising
the skin from the meat, put under the flap a nice forcemeat, made by recipe No. 417. Prepare
sufficient of this, as there should be some left to eat cold, and to season and flavour a mince
if required. Skewer and bind the veal up in a round form; dredge well with flour, put it down
at some distance from the fire at first, and baste continually. About 1/2 hour before serving,
draw it nearer the fire, that it may acquire more colour, as the outside should be of a rich
brown, but not burnt. Dish it, remove the skewers, which replace by a silver one; pour over
the joint some good melted butter, and serve with either boiled ham, bacon, or pickled pork.
Never omit to send a cut lemon to table with roast veal.

Time.--A fillet of veal weighing 12 lbs., about 4 hours.

Average cost, 9d. per lb.

Sufficient for 9 or 10 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

STEWED FILLET OF VEAL.

873. INGREDIENTS.--A small fillet of veal, forcemeat No. 417, thickening of butter and flour,
a few mushrooms, white pepper to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, 2 blades of pounded
mace, 1/2 glass of sherry.

Mode.--If the whole of the leg is purchased, take off the knuckle to stew, and also the square
end, which will serve for cutlets or pies. Remove the bone, and fill the space with a forcemeat
No. 417. Roll and skewer it up firmly; place a few skewers at the bottom of a stewpan to prevent
the meat from sticking, and cover the veal with a little weak stock. Let it simmer very gently
until tender, as the more slowly veal is stewed, the better. Strain and thicken the sauce,
flavour it with lemon-juice, mace, sherry, and white pepper; give one boil, and pour it over
the meat. The skewers should be removed, and replaced by a silver one, and the dish garnished
with slices of cut lemon.

Time.--A. fillet of veal weighing 6 lbs., 3 hours' very gentle stewing.

THE GOLDEN CALF.--We are told in the book of Genesis, that Aaron, in the lengthened absence
of Moses, was constrained by the impatient people to make them an image to worship; and that
Aaron, instead of using his delegated power to curb this sinful expression of the tribes, and
appease the discontented Jews, at once complied with their demand, and, telling them to bring
to him their rings and trinkets, fashioned out of their willing contributions a calf of gold,
before which the multitude fell down and worshipped. Whether this image was a solid figure
of gold, or a wooden effigy merely, coated with metal, is uncertain. To suppose the former,--knowing
the size of the image made from such trifling articles as rings, we must presuppose the Israelites
to have spoiled the Egyptians most unmercifully: the figure, however, is of more consequence
than the weight or size of the idol. That the Israelite brought away more from Goshen than
the plunder of the Egyptians, and that they were deeply imbued with Egyptian superstition,
the golden calf is only one, out of many instances of proof; for a gilded ox, covered with
a pall, was in that country an emblem of Osiris, one of the gods of the Egyptian trinity. Besides
having a sacred cow, and many varieties of the holy bull, this priest-ridden people worshipped
the ox as a symbol of the sun, and offered to it divine honours, as the emblem of frugality,
industry, and husbandry. It is therefore probable that, in borrowing so familiar a type, the
Israelites, in their calf-worship, meant, under a well-understood cherubic symbol, to acknowledge
the full force of those virtues, under an emblem of divine power and goodness. The prophet
Hosea is full of denunciations against calf-worship in Israel, and alludes to the custom of
kissing these idols, Hosea, viii, 4-6.

FRICANDEAU OF VEAL (an Entree).

874. INGREDIENTS.--A piece of the fat side of a leg of veal (about 3 lbs.), lardoons, 2 carrots,
2 large onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 6 whole allspice, 2 bay-leaves,
pepper to taste, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 pint of stock No. 107.

Mode.--The veal for a fricandeau should be of the best quality, or it will not be good. It
may be known by the meat being white and not thready. Take off the skin, flatten the veal on
the table, then at one stroke of the knife, cut off as much as is required, for a fricandeau
with an uneven surface never looks well. Trim it, and with a sharp knife make two or three
slits in the middle, that it may taste more of the seasoning. Now lard it thickly with fat
bacon, as lean gives a red colour to the fricandeau. Slice the vegetables, and put these, with
the herbs and spices, in the middle of a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon at the top: these
should form a sort of mound in the centre for the veal to rest upon. Lay the fricandeau over
the bacon, sprinkle over it a little salt, and pour in just sufficient stock to cover the bacon,
&c., without touching the veal. Let it gradually come to a boil; then put it over a slow and
equal fire, and let it simmer very gently for about 2-1/2 hours, or longer should it be very
large. Baste it frequently with the liquor, and a short time before serving, put it into a
brisk oven, to make the bacon firm, which otherwise would break when it was glazed. Dish the
fricandeau, keep it hot, skim off the fat from the liquor, and reduce it quickly to a glaze,
with which glaze the fricandeau, and serve with a purée of whatever vegetable happens to be
in season--spinach, sorrel, asparagus, cucumbers, peas, &c.

Time.--2-1/2 hours. If very large, allow more time.

Average cost, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient for an entrée.

Seasonable from March to October.

FRICANDEAU OF VEAL (More economical.)

875. INGREDIENTS.--The best end of a neck of veal (about 2-1/2 lbs.), lardoons, 2 carrots,
2 onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of mace, 2 bay-leaves, a little whole white pepper,
a few slices of fat bacon.

Mode.--Cut away the lean part of the best end of a neck of veal with a sharp knife, scooping
it from the bones. Put the bones in with a little water, which will serve to moisten the fricandeau:
they should stew about 1-1/2 hour. Lard the veal, proceed in the same way as in the preceding
recipe, and be careful that the gravy does not touch the fricandeau. Stew very gently for 3
hours; glaze, and serve it on sorrel, spinach, or with a little gravy in the dish.

Time.--3 hours.

Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient for an entrée.

Seasonable from March to October.

Note.--When the prime part of the leg is cut off, it spoils the whole; consequently, to use
this for a fricandeau is rather extravagant. The best end of the neck answers the purpose nearly
or quite as well.

BOILED CALF'S HEAD (with the Skin on).

876. INGREDIENTS.--Calf's head, boiling water, bread crumbs, 1 large bunch of parsley, butter,
white pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice,
2 or 3 grains of cayenne.

Mode.--Put the head into boiling water, and let it remain by the side of the fire for 3 or
4 minutes; take it out, hold it by the ear, and with the back of a knife, scrape off the hair
(should it not come off easily, dip the head again into boiling water). When perfectly clean,
take the eyes out, cut off the ears, and remove the brain, which soak for an hour in warm water.
Put the head into hot water to soak for a few minutes, to make it look white, and then have
ready a stewpan, into which lay the head; cover it with cold water, and bring it gradually
to boil. Remove the scum, and add a little salt, which assists to throw it up. Simmer it very
gently from 2-1/2 to 3 hours, and when nearly done, boil the brains for 1/4 hour; skin and
chop them, not too finely, and add a tablespoonful of minced parsley which has been previously
scalded. Season with pepper and salt, and stir the brains, parsley, &c., into about 4 tablespoonfuls
of melted butter; add the lemon-juice and cayenne, and keep these hot by the side of the fire.
Take up the head, cut out the tongue, skin it, put it on a small dish with the brains round
it; sprinkle over the head a few bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley; brown these
before the fire, and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter, and either boiled bacon, ham,
or pickled pork as an accompaniment.

Time.--2-1/2 to 3 hours.

Average cost, according to the season, from 3s. to 7s. 6d.

Sufficient for 8 or 9 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

BOILED CALF'S HEAD (without the Skin).

877. INGREDIENTS.--Calf's head, water, a little salt, 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 1
tablespoonful of minced parsley, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.

Mode.--After the head has been thoroughly cleaned, and the brains removed, soak it in warm
water to blanch it. Lay the brains also into warm water to soak, and let them remain for about
an hour. Put the head into a stewpan, with sufficient cold water to cover it, and when it boils,
add a little salt; take off every particle of scum as it rises, and boil the head until perfectly
tender. Boil the brains, chop them, and mix with them melted butter, minced parsley, pepper,
salt, and lemon-juice in the above proportion. Take up the head, skin the tongue, and put it
on a small dish with the brains round it. Have ready some parsley and butter, smother the head
with it, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Bacon, ham, pickled pork, or a pig's
cheek, are indispensable with calf's head. The brains are sometimes chopped with hard-boiled
eggs, and mixed with a little Béchamel or white sauce.

Time.--From 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 hours.

Average cost, according to the season, from 3s. to 5s.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

Note.--The liquor in which the head was boiled should be saved: it makes excellent soup, and
will be found a nice addition to gravies, &c. Half a calf's head is as frequently served as
a whole one, it being a more convenient-sized joint for a small family. It is cooked in the
same manner, and served with the same sauces, as in the preceding recipe.

HASHED CALF'S HEAD (Cold Meat Cookery).

878.

Mode.--Cut the meat into neat slices, and put the bones and trimmings into a stewpan with the
above proportion of liquor that the head was boiled in. Strain it into a clean stewpan, thicken
it with a little butter and flour, and add a flavouring of sherry, lemon-juice, and ketchup,
in the above proportion; season with pepper, salt, and a little cayenne; put in the meat, let
it gradually warm through, but not boil more than two or three minutes. Garnish the dish with
forcemeat balls and pieces of bacon rolled and toasted, placed alternately, and send it to
table very hot.

Time.--Altogether 1-1/2 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the remains of the head, 6d.

Seasonable from March to October.

VEAL COLLOPS (an Entree).

879. INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs. of the prime part of the leg of veal, a few slices of bacon,
forcemeat No. 417, cayenne to taste, egg and bread crumbs, gravy.

Mode.--Cut the veal into long thin collops, flatten them, and lay on each a piece of thin bacon
of the same size; have ready some forcemeat, made by recipe No. 417, which spread over the
bacon, sprinkle over all a little cayenne, roll them up tightly, and do not let them be more
than 2 inches long. Skewer each one firmly, egg and bread crumb them, and fry them a nice brown
in a little butter, turning them occasionally, and shaking the pan about. When done, place
them on a dish before the fire; put a small piece of butter in the pan, dredge in a little
flour, add 1/4 pint of water, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, a seasoning of salt, pepper,
and pounded mace; let the whole boil up, and pour it over the collops.

CALF'S LIVER AUX FINES HERBES & SAUCE PIQUANTE.

880. INGREDIENTS.--A calf's liver, flour, a bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley; when
liked, 2 minced shalots; 1 teaspoonful of flour, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon-juice, pepper and salt to taste, 1/4 pint water.

Mode.--Procure a calf's liver as white as possible, and cut it into slices of a good and equal
shape. Dip them in flour, and fry them of a good colour in a little butter. When they are done,
put them on a dish, which keep hot before the fire. Mince the herbs very fine, put them in
the frying-pan with a little more butter; add the remaining ingredients, simmer gently until
the herbs are done, and pour over the liver.

Time.--According to the thickness of the slices, from 5 to 10 minutes.

Average cost, 10d. per lb. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

CALF'S LIVER AND BACON.

881. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 lbs. of liver, bacon, pepper and salt to taste, a small piece of
butter, flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, 1/4 pint of water.

Mode.--Cut the liver in thin slices, and cut as many slices of bacon as there are of liver;
fry the bacon first, and put that on a hot dish before the fire. Fry the liver in the fat which
comes from the bacon, after seasoning it with pepper and salt and dredging over it a very little
flour. Turn the liver occasionally to prevent its burning, and when done, lay it round the
dish with a piece of bacon between each. Pour away the bacon fat, put in a small piece of butter,
dredge in a little flour, add the lemon-juice and water, give one boil, and pour it in the
middle of the dish. It may be garnished with slices of cut lemon, or forcemeat balls.

Seasonable from March to October.

CALF'S LIVER LARDED AND ROASTED (an Entree).

882. INGREDIENTS.--A calf's liver, vinegar, 1 onion, 3 or 4 sprigs of parsley and thyme, salt
and pepper to taste, 1 bay-leaf, lardoons, brown gravy.

Mode.--Take a fine white liver, and lard it the same as a fricandeau; put it into vinegar with
an onion cut in slices, parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, and seasoning in the above proportion. Let
it remain in this pickle for 24 hours, then roast and baste it frequently with the vinegar,
&c.; glaze it, serve under it a good brown gravy, or sauce piquante, and send it to table very hot.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour.

Note.--Calf's liver stuffed with forcemeat No. 417, to which has been added a little fat bacon,
will be found a very savoury dish. It should be larded or wrapped in buttered paper, and roasted
before a clear fire. Brown gravy and currant jelly should be served with it.

FILLET OF VEAL AU BECHAMEL (Cold Meat Cookery).

883. INGREDIENTS.--A small fillet of veal, 1 pint of Béchamel sauce No. 367, a few bread crumbs,
clarified butter.

Mode.--A fillet of real that has been roasted the preceding day will answer very well for this
dish. Cut the middle out rather deep, leaving a good margin round, from which to cut nice slices,
and if there should be any cracks in the veal, fill them up with forcemeat. Mince finely the
meat that was taken out, mixing with it a little of the forcemeat to flavour, and stir to it
sufficient Béchamel to make it of a proper consistency. Warm the veal in the oven for about
an hour, taking care to baste it well, that it may not be dry; put the mince in the place where
the meat was taken out, sprinkle a few bread crumbs over it, and drop a little clarified butter
on the bread crumbs; put it into the oven for 1/4 hour to brown, and pour Béchamel round the
sides of the dish.

Time.--Altogether 1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable from March to October.

TO RAGOUT A KNUCKLE OF VEAL.

884. INGREDIENTS.--Knuckle of veal, pepper and salt to taste, flour, 1 onion, 1 head of celery,
or a little celery-seed, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, thickening of
butter and flour, a few young carrots, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of tomato
sauce, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry, the juice of 1/4 lemon.

Mode.--Cut the meat from a knuckle of veal into neat slices, season with pepper and salt, and
dredge them with flour. Fry them in a little butter of a pale brown, and put them into a stewpan
with the bone (which should be chopped in several places); add the celery, herbs, mace, and
carrots; pour over all about 1 pint of hot water, and let it simmer very gently for 2 hours,
over a slow but clear fire. Take out the slices of meat and carrots, strain and thicken the
gravy with a little butter rolled in flour; add the remaining ingredients, give one boil, put
back the meat and carrots, let these get hot through, and serve. When in season, a few green
peas, boiled separately, and added to this dish at the moment of serving, would be found a
very agreeable addition.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, 5d. to 6d. per lb.

Sufficient for 4 or 6 persons.

STEWED KNUCKLE OF VEAL AND RICE.

885. INGREDIENTS.--Knuckle of veal, 1 onion, 2 blades of mace, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 lb.
of rice.

Mode.--Have the knuckle cut small, or cut some cutlets from it, that it may be just large enough
to be eaten the same day it is dressed, as cold boiled veal is not a particularly tempting
dish. Break the shank-bone, wash it clean, and put the meat into a stewpan with sufficient
water to cover it. Let it gradually come to a boil, put in the salt, and remove the scum as
fast as it rises. When it has simmered gently for about 3/4 hour, add the remaining ingredients,
and stew the whole gently for 2-1/4 hours. Put the meat into a deep dish, pour over it the
rice, &c., and send boiled bacon, and a tureen of parsley and butter to table with it.

Note.--Macaroni, instead of rice, boiled with the veal, will be found good; or the rice and
macaroni may be omitted, and the veal sent to table smothered in parsley and butter.

ROAST LOIN OF VEAL.

886. INGREDIENTS.--Veal; melted butter.

Mode.--Paper the kidney fat; roll in and skewer the flap, which makes the joint a good shape;
dredge it well with flour, and put it down to a bright fire. Should the loin be very large,
skewer the kidney back for a time to roast thoroughly. Keep it well basted, and a short time
before serving, remove the paper from the kidney, and allow it to acquire a nice brown colour,
but it should not be burnt. Have ready some melted butter, put it into the dripping-pan after
it is emptied of its contents, pour it over the veal, and serve. Garnish the dish with slices
of lemon and forcemeat balls, and send to table with it, boiled bacon, ham, pickled pork, or
pig's cheek.

Time.--A large loin, 3 hours.

LOIN OF VEAL AU BECHAMEL (Cold Meat Cookery).

887.

Mode.--A loin of veal which has come from table with very little taken off, answers very well
for this dish. Cut off the meat from the inside, mince it, and mix with it some minced lemon-peel;
put it into sufficient Béchamel to warm through. In the mean time, wrap the joint in buttered
paper, and place it in the oven to warm. When thoroughly hot, dish the mince, place the loin
above it, and pour over the remainder of the Béchamel.

Time.--1-1/2 hour to warm the meat in the oven.

Seasonable from March to October.

LOIN OF VEAL, a la Daube.

888. INGREDIENTS.--The chump end of a loin of veal, forcemeat No. 417, a few slices of bacon,
a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades of mace, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole white pepper, 1 pint of
veal stock or water, 5 or 6 green onions.

Mode.--Cut off the chump from a loin of veal, and take out the bone; fill the cavity with forcemeat
No. 417, tie it up tightly, and lay it in a stewpan with the bones and trimmings, and cover
the veal with a few slices of bacon. Add the herbs, mace, pepper, and onions, and stock or
water; cover the pan with a closely-fitting lid, and simmer for 2 hours, shaking the stewpan
occasionally. Take out the bacon, herbs, and onions; reduce the gravy, if not already thick
enough, to a glaze, with which glaze the meat, and serve with tomato, mushroom, or sorrel sauce.

Time.--2 hours.

Average cost, 9d. per lb.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

MINCED VEAL, with Béchamel Sauce (Cold Meat Cookery).

(Very Good.)

889. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a fillet of veal, 1 pint of Béchamel sauce No. 367, 1/2 teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel, forcemeat balls.

Mode.--Cut--but do not chop--a few slices of cold roast veal as finely as possible, sufficient
to make rather more than 1 lb., weighed after being minced. Make the above proportion of Béchamel,
by recipe No. 367; add the lemon-peel, put in the veal, and let the whole gradually warm through.
When it is at the point of simmering, dish it, and garnish with forcemeat balls and fried sippets
of bread.

Time.--To simmer 1 minute.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, 1s. 4d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from March to October.

MINCED VEAL.

(More Economical.)

890.

Mode.--Take about 1 lb. of veal, and should there be any bones, dredge them with flour, and
put them into a stewpan with the brown outside, and a few meat trimmings; add rather more than
a pint of water, the onion cut in slices, lemon-peel, seasoning, mace, carrots, and herbs;
simmer these well for rather more than 1 hour, and strain the liquor. Rub a little flour into
some butter; add this to the gravy, set it on the fire, and, when it boils, skim well. Mince
the veal finely by cutting, and not chopping it; put it in the gravy; let it get warmed through
gradually; add the lemon-juice and cream, and, when it is on the point of boiling, serve. Garnish
the dish with sippets of toasted bread and slices of bacon rolled and toasted. Forcemeat balls
may also be added. If more lemon-peel is liked than is stated above, put a little very finely
minced to the veal, after it is warmed in the gravy.

Time.--1 hour to make the gravy.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, 6d.

Seasonable from March to October.

    THE CALF A SYMBOL OF DIVINE POWER.--A singular symbolical
    ceremony existed among the Hebrews, in which the calf performed
    a most important part. The calf being a type or symbol of Divine
    power, or what was called the Elohim,--the Almighty
    intelligence that brought them out of Egypt,--was looked upon
    much in the same light by the Jews, as the cross subsequently
    was by the Christians, a mystical emblem of the Divine passion
    and goodness. Consequently, an oath taken on either the calf or
    the cross was considered equally solemn and sacred by Jew or
    Nazarene, and the breaking of it a soul-staining perjury on
    themselves, and an insult and profanation directly offered to
    the Almighty. To render the oath more impressive and solemn, it
    was customary to slaughter a dedicated calf in the temple, when,
    the priests having divided the carcase into a certain number of
    parts, and with intervening spaces, arranged the severed limbs
    on the marble pavement, the one, or all the party, if there were
    many individuals, to be bound by the oath, repeating the words
    of the compact, threaded their way in and out through the
    different spaces, till they had taken the circuit of each
    portion of the divided calf, when the ceremony was concluded. To
    avert the anger of the Lord, when Jerusalem was threatened by
    Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian host, the Jews had made a
    solemn to God, ratified by the ceremony of the calf, if He
    released them from their dreaded foe, to cancel the servitude of
    their Hebrew brethren. After investing the city for some time,
    and reducing the inhabitants to dreadful suffering and
    privation, the Babylonians, hearing that Pharaoh, whom the Jews
    had solicited for aid, was rapidly approaching with a powerful
    army, hastily raised the siege, and, removing to a distance,
    took up a position where they could intercept the Egyptians, and
    still cover the city. No sooner did the Jews behold the retreat
    of the enemy, than they believed all danger was past, and, with
    their usual turpitude, they repudiated their oath, and refused
    to liberate their oppressed countrymen. For this violation of
    their covenant with the Lord, they were given over to all the
    horrors of the sword, pestilence, and famine--Jeremiah, xxxiv.
    15-17.

MINCED VEAL AND MACARONI.

(A pretty side or corner dish.)

891. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of minced cold roast veal, 3 oz. of ham, 1 tablespoonful of gravy,
pepper and salt to taste, 3 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 1/4 lb.
of macaroni, 1 or 2 eggs to bind, a small piece of butter.

Mode.--Cut some nice slices from a cold fillet of veal, trim off the brown outside, and mince
the meat finely with the above proportion of ham: should the meat be very dry, add a spoonful
of good gravy. Season highly with pepper and salt, add the grated nutmeg and bread crumbs,
and mix these ingredients with 1 or 2 eggs well beaten, which should bind the mixture and make
it like forcemeat. In the mean time, boil the macaroni in salt and water, and drain it; butter
a mould, put some of the macaroni at the bottom and sides of it, in whatever form is liked;
mix the remainder with the forcemeat, fill the mould up to the top, put a plate or small dish
on it, and steam for 1/2 hour.

Seasonable from March to October.

Note.--To make a variety, boil some carrots and turnips separately in a little salt and water;
when done, cut them into pieces about 1/8 inch in thickness; butter an oval mould, and place
these in it, in white and red stripes alternately, at the bottom and sides. Proceed as in the
foregoing recipe, and be very careful in turning it out of the mould.

MOULDED MINCED VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery).

892. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of cold roast veal, a small slice of bacon, 1/4 teaspoonful of minced
lemon-peel, 1/2 onion chopped fine, salt, pepper, and pounded mace to taste, a slice of toast
soaked in milk, 1 egg.

Mode.--Mince the meat very fine, after removing from it all skin and outside pieces, and chop
the bacon; mix these well together, adding the lemon-peel, onion, seasoning, mace, and toast.
When all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated, heat up an egg, with which bind the mixture.
Butter a shape, put in the meat, and hake for 3/4 hour; turn it out of the mould carefully,
and pour round it a good brown gravy. A sheep's head dressed in this manner is an economical
and savoury dish.

Seasonable from March to October.

BRAISED NECK OF VEAL.

893. INGREDIENTS.--The best end of the neck of veal (from 3 to 4 lbs.), bacon, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste; 1 onion, 2 carrots, a little celery
(when this is not obtainable, use the seed), 1/2 glass of sherry, thickening of butter and
flour, lemon-juice, 1 blade of pounded mace.

Mode.--Prepare the bacon for larding, and roll it in minced parsley, salt, pepper, and grated
nutmeg; lard the veal, put it into a stewpan with a few slices of lean bacon or ham, an onion,
carrots, and celery; and do not quite cover it with water. Stew it gently for 2 hours, or until
it is quite tender; strain off the liquor; stir together over the fire, in a stewpan, a little
flour and butter until brown; lay the veal in this, the upper side to the bottom of the pan,
and let it remain till of a nice brown colour.

    BIRTH OF CALVES.--The cow seldom produces more than a single
    calf; sometimes, twins, and, very rarely, three. A French
    newspaper, however,--the "Nouveau Bulletin des Sciences,"--gave
    a trustworthy but extraordinary account of a cow which produced
    nine calves in all, at three successive births, in three
    successive years. The first year, four cow calves; the second
    year, three calves, two of them females; the third year, two
    calves, both females. With the exception of two belonging to the
    first birth, all were suckled by the mother.

ROAST NECK OF VEAL.

894. INGREDIENTS.--Veal, melted butter, forcemeat balls.

Mode.--Have the veal cut from the best end of the neck; dredge it with flour, and put it down
to a bright clear fire; keep it well basted; dish it, pour over it some melted butter, and
garnish the dish with fried forcemeat balls; send to table with a cut lemon. The scrag may
be boiled or stewed in various ways, with rice, onion-sauce, or parsley and butter.

Seasonable from March to October.

VEAL OLIVE PIE (Cold Meat Cookery).

895. INGREDIENTS.--A few thin slices of cold fillet of veal, a few thin slices of bacon, forcemeat
No. 417, a cupful of gravy, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, puff-crust.

Mode.--Cut thin slices from a fillet of veal, place on them thin slices of bacon, and over
them a layer of forcemeat, made by recipe No. 417, with an additional seasoning of shalot and
cayenne; roll them tightly, and fill up a pie-dish with them; add the gravy and cream, cover
with a puff-crust, and bake for 1 to 1-1/2 hour: should the pie be very large, allow 2 hours.
The pieces of rolled veal should be about 3 inches in length, and about 3 inches round.

Time.--Moderate-sized pie, 1 to 1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable from March to October.

FRIED PATTIES (Cold Meat Cookery).

896. INGREDIENTS.--Cold roast veal, a few slices of cold ham, 1 egg boiled hard, pounded mace,
pepper and salt to taste, gravy, cream, 1 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, good puff-paste.

Mode.--Mince a little cold veal and ham, allowing one-third ham to two-thirds veal; add an
egg boiled hard and chopped, and a seasoning of pounded mace, salt, pepper, and lemon-peel;
moisten with a little gravy and cream. Make a good puff-paste; roll rather thin, and cut it
into round or square pieces; put the mince between two of them, pinch the edges to keep in
the gravy, and fry a light brown. They may be also baked in patty-pans: in that case, they
should be brushed over with the yolk of an egg before they are put in the oven. To make a variety,
oysters may be substituted for the ham.

Time.--15 minutes to fry the patties.

Seasonable from March to October.

VEAL PIE.

897. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of veal cutlets, 1 or 2 slices of lean bacon or ham, pepper and salt
to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, crust, 1 teacupful
of gravy.

Mode.--Cut the cutlets into square pieces, and season them with
pepper, salt, and pounded mace; put them in a pie-dish with the savoury
herbs sprinkled over, and 1 or 2 slices of lean bacon or ham placed at
the top: if possible, this should be previously cooked, as undressed
bacon makes the veal red, and spoils its appearance. Pour in a little
water, cover with crust, ornament it in any way that is approved; brush
it over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a well-heated oven for
about 1-1/2 hour. Pour in a good gravy after baking, which is done by
removing the top ornament, and replacing it after the gravy is added. 6d. The judge, observing the surprise of his
    guests, volunteered an explanation.--"Oh, ay, it's a' cauf;
    when we kill a beast, we just eat up ae side, and doun the
    tither."

VEAL AND HAM PIE.

898. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of veal cutlets, 1/2 lb. of boiled ham, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced
savoury herbs, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 2 blades of pounded mace, pepper and salt
to taste, a strip of lemon-peel finely minced, the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 pint of
water, nearly 1/2 pint of good strong gravy, puff-crust.

Mode.--Cut the veal into nice square pieces, and put a layer of them at the bottom of a pie-dish;
sprinkle over these a portion of the herbs, spices, seasoning, lemon-peel, and the yolks of
the eggs cut in slices; cut the ham very thin, and put a layer of this in. Proceed in this
manner until the dish is full, so arranging it that the ham comes at the top. This pie may
be very much enriched by adding a few mushrooms, oysters, or sweetbreads; but it will be found
very good without any of the last-named additions.

Time.--1-1/2 hour, or longer, should the pie be very large. Average cost, 3s. Sufficient for
5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from March to October.

POTTED VEAL (for Breakfast).

899. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of veal allow 1/4 lb. of ham, cayenne and pounded mace to taste,
6 oz. of fresh butter; clarified butter.

Mode.--Mince the veal and ham together as finely as possible, and pound well in a mortar, with
cayenne, pounded mace, and fresh butter in the above proportion. When reduced to a perfectly
smooth paste, press it into potting-pots, and cover with clarified butter. If kept in a cool
place, it will remain good some days.

Seasonable from March to October.

    NAMES OF CALVES, &c.--During the time the young male calf is
    suckled by his mother, he is called a bull-or ox-calf; when
    turned a year old, he is called a stirk, stot, or yearling; on
    the completion of his second year, he is called a two-year-old
    bull or steer (and in some counties a twinter); then, a
    three-year-old steer; and at four, an ox or a bullock, which
    latter names are retained till death. It may be here remarked,
    that the term ox is used as a general or common appellation for
    neat cattle, in a specific sense, and irrespective of sex; as
    the British ox, the Indian ox. The female is termed cow, but
    while sucking the mother, a cow-calf; at the age of a year, she
    is called a yearling quey; in another year, a heifer, or
    twinter; then, a three-year-old quey or twinter; and, at four
    years old, a cow. Other names, to be regarded as provincialisms,
    may exist in different districts.

RAGOUT OF COLD VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery).

900. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold veal, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of gravy, thickening
of butter and flour, pepper and salt to taste, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful of
mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of sherry, 1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, forcemeat balls.

Mode.--Any part of veal will make this dish. Cut the meat into nice-looking pieces, put them
in a stewpan with 1 oz. of butter, and fry a light brown; add the gravy (hot water may be substituted
for this), thicken with a little butter and flour, and stew gently about 1/4 hour; season with
pepper, salt, and pounded mace; add the ketchup, sherry, and lemon-juice; give one boil, and
serve. Garnish the dish with forcemeat balls and fried rashers of bacon.

Note.--The above recipe may be varied, by adding vegetables, such as peas, cucumbers, lettuces,
green onions cut in slices, a dozen or two of green gooseberries (not seedy), all of which
should be fried a little with the meat, and then stewed in the gravy.

VEAL RISSOLES (Cold Meat Cookery).

901. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold roast veal, a few slices of ham or bacon, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, 1 tablespoonful of minced savoury herbs, 1 blade of pounded mace, a very
little grated nutmeg, cayenne and salt to taste, 2 eggs well beaten, bread crumbs.

Mode.--Mince the veal very finely with a little ham or bacon; add the parsley, herbs, spices,
and seasoning; mix into a paste with an egg; form into balls or cones; brush these over with
egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and fry a rich brown. Serve with brown gravy, and garnish
the dish with fried parsley.

Time.--About 10 minutes to fry the rissoles.

Seasonable from March to October.

VEAL ROLLS (Cold Meat Cookery).

902. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a cold fillet of veal, egg and bread crumbs, a few slices
of fat bacon, forcemeat No. 417.

Mode.--Cut a few slices from a cold fillet of veal 1/2 inch thick; rub them over with egg;
lay a thin slice of fat bacon over each piece of veal; brush these with the egg, and over this
spread the forcemeat thinly; roll up each piece tightly, egg and bread crumb them, and fry
them a rich brown. Serve with mushroom sauce or brown gravy.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes to fry the rolls.

Seasonable from March to October.

SHOULDER OF VEAL, Stuffed and Stewed.

903. INGREDIENTS.--A shoulder of veal, a few slices of ham or bacon, forcemeat No. 417, 3 carrots,
2 onions, salt and pepper to taste, a faggot of savoury herbs, 3 blades of pounded mace, water,
thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Bone the joint by carefully detaching the meat from the blade-bone on one side, and
then on the other, being particular not to pierce the skin; then cut the bone from the knuckle,
and take it out. Fill the cavity whence the bone was taken with a forcemeat made by recipe
No. 417. Roll and bind the veal up tightly; put it into a stew-pan with the carrots, onions,
seasoning, herbs, and mace; pour in just sufficient water to cover it, and let it stew very
gently for about 5 hours. Before taking it up, try if it is properly done by thrusting a larding-needle
in it: if it penetrates easily, it is sufficiently cooked. Strain and skim the gravy, thicken
with butter and flour, give one boil, and pour it round the meat. A few young carrots may be
boiled and placed round the dish as a garnish, and, when in season, green peas should always
be served with this dish. Seasonable from March to October.

    THE FATTENING OF CALVES.--The fattening of calves for the market
    is an important business in Lanarkshire or Clydesdale, and
    numbers of newly-dropped calves are regularly carried there from
    the farmers of the adjacent districts, in order to be prepared
    for the butcher. The mode of feeding them is very simple; milk
    is the chief article of their diet, and of this the calves
    require a sufficient supply from first to last. Added to this,
    they must be kept in a well-aired place, neither too hot nor too
    cold, and freely supplied with dry litter. It is usual to
    exclude the light,--at all events to a great degree, and to put
    within their reach a lump of chalk, which they are very fond of
    licking. Thus fed, calves, at the end of 8 or 9 weeks, often
    attain a very large size; viz., 18 to 20 stone, exclusive of the
    offal. Far heavier weights have occurred, and without any
    deterioration in the delicacy and richness of the flesh. This
    mode of feeding upon milk alone at first appears to be very
    expensive, but it is not so, when all things are taken into
    consideration; for at the age of 9 or 10 weeks a calf,
    originally purchased for 8 shillings, will realize nearly the
    same number of pounds. For 4, or even 6 weeks, the milk of one
    cow is sufficient,--indeed half that quantity is enough for the
    first fortnight; but after the 5th or 6th week it will consume
    the greater portion of the milk of two moderate cows; but then
    it requires neither oil-cake nor linseed, nor any other food.
    Usually, however, the calves are not kept beyond the age of 6
    weeks, and will then sell for 5 or 6 pounds each: the milk of
    the cow is then ready for a successor. In this manner a relay of
    calves may be prepared for the markets from early spring to the
    end of summer, a plan more advantageous than that of overfeeding
    one to a useless degree of corpulency.

VEAL SAUSAGES.

904. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of fat bacon and lean veal; to every lb. of meat, allow
1 teaspoonful of minced sage, salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--Chop the meat and bacon finely, and to every lb. allow the above proportion of very
finely-minced sage; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, mix the whole well together, make it
into flat cakes, and fry a nice brown.

Seasonable from March to October.

STEWED VEAL, with Peas, young Carrots, and new Potatoes.

905. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 lbs. of the loin or neck of veal, 15 young carrots, a few green onions,
1 pint of green peas, 12 new potatoes, a bunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste,
1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom
ketchup.

Mode.--Dredge the meat with flour, and roast or bake it for about 3/4 hour: it should acquire
a nice brown colour. Put the meat into a stewpan with the carrots, onions, potatoes, herbs,
pepper, and salt; pour over it sufficient boiling water to cover it, and stew gently for 2
hours. Take out the meat and herbs, put it in a deep dish, skim off all the fat from the gravy,
and flavour it with lemon-juice, tomato sauce, and mushroom ketchup in the above proportion.
Have ready a pint of green peas boiled; put these with the meat, pour over it the gravy, and
serve. The dish may be garnished with a few forcemeat balls. The meat, when preferred, may
be cut into chops, and floured and fried instead of being roasted; and any part of veal dressed
in this way will be found extremely savoury and good.

BAKED SWEETBREADS (an Entree).

906. INGREDIENTS.--3 sweetbreads, egg and bread crumbs, oiled butter, 3 slices of toast, brown
gravy.

Mode.--Choose large white sweetbreads; put them into warm water to draw out the blood, and
to improve their colour; let them remain for rather more than 1 hour; then put them into boiling
water, and allow them to simmer for about 10 minutes, which renders them firm. Take them up,
drain them, brush over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs; dip them in egg again, and then
into more bread crumbs. Drop on them a little oiled butter, and put the sweetbreads into a
moderately-heated oven, and let them bake for nearly 3/4 hour. Make 3 pieces of toast; place
the sweetbreads on the toast, and pour round, but not over them, a good brown gravy.

Time.--To soak 1 hour, to be boiled 10 minutes, baked 40 minutes.

Average cost, 1s. to 5s. Sufficient for an entrée.

Seasonable.--In full season from May to August.

FRIED SWEETBREADS a la Maitre d'Hotel (an Entree).

907.

Mode.--Soak the sweetbreads in warm water for an hour; then boil them for 10 minutes; cut them
in slices, egg and bread crumb them, season with pepper and salt, and put them into a frying-pan,
with the above proportion of butter. Keep turning them until done, which will be in about 10
minutes; dish them, and pour over them a Maître d'hôtel sauce, made by recipe No. 466. The
dish may be garnished with slices of cut lemon.

Time.--To soak 1 hour, to be broiled 10 minutes, to be fried about 10 minutes.

Average cost, 1s. to 5s., according to the season.

Sufficient for an entrée.

Seasonable.--In full season from May to August.

Note.--The egg and bread crumb may be omitted, and the slices of sweetbread dredged with a
little flour instead, and a good gravy may be substituted for the maitre d'hôtel sauce. This
is a very simple method of dressing them.

STEWED SWEETBREADS (an Entree).

908. INGREDIENTS.--3 sweetbreads, 1 pint of white stock No. 107, thickening of butter and flour,
6 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 blade of pounded mace, white pepper
and salt to taste.

Mode.--Soak the sweetbreads in warm water for 1 hour, and boil them for 10 minutes; take them
out, put them into cold water for a few minutes; lay them in a stewpan with the stock, and
simmer them gently for rather more than 1/2 hour. Dish them; thicken the gravy with a little
butter and flour; let it boil up, add the remaining ingredients, allow the sauce to get quite
hot, but not boil, and pour it over the sweetbreads.

Time.--To soak 1 hour, to be boiled 10 minutes, stewed rather more than 1/2 hour.

    SEASON AND CHOICE OF VEAL.--Veal, like all other meats, has its
    season of plenty. The best veal, and the largest supply, are to
    be had from March to the end of July. It comes principally from
    the western counties, and is generally of the Alderney breed. In
    purchasing veal, its whiteness and fineness of grain should be
    considered, the colour being especially of the utmost
    consequence. Veal may be bought at all times of the year and of
    excellent quality, but is generally very dear, except in the
    months of plenty.

STEWED TENDRONS DE VEAU (an Entree).

909. INGREDIENTS.--The gristles from 2 breasts of veal, stock No. 107, 1 faggot of savoury
herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 4 cloves, 2 carrots, 2 onions, a strip of lemon-peel.

Mode.--The tendrons or gristles, which are found round the front of a breast of veal, are now
very frequently served as an entrée, and when well dressed, make a nice and favourite dish.
Detach the gristles from the bone, and cut them neatly out, so as not to spoil the joint for
roasting or stewing. Put them into a stewpan, with sufficient stock, No. 107, to cover them;
add the herbs, mace, cloves, carrots, onions, and lemon, and simmer these for nearly, or quite,
4 hours. They should be stewed until a fork will enter the meat easily. Take them up, drain
them, strain the gravy, boil it down to a glaze, with which glaze the meat. Dish the tendrons
in a circle, with croûtons fried of a nice colour placed between each; and put mushroom sauce,
or a purée of green peas or tomatoes, in the middle.

Time.--4 hours. Sufficient for one entrée.

Seasonable.--With peas, from June to August.

    COW-POX, OR VARIOLA.--It is to Dr. Jenner, of Berkeley,
    Gloucestershire, who died in 1823, that we owe the practice of
    vaccination, as a preservative from the attack of that
    destructive scourge of the human race, the small-pox. The
    experiments of this philosophic man were begun in 1797, and
    published the next year. He had observed that cows were subject
    to a certain infectious eruption of the teats, and that those
    persons who became affected by it, while milking the cattle,
    escaped the small-pox raging around them. This fact, known to
    farmers from time immemorial, led him to a course of
    experiments, the result of which all are acquainted with.

TENDRONS DE VEAU (an Entree).

910.

Mode.--After removing the gristles from a breast of veal, stew them for 4 hours, as in the
preceding recipe, with stock, herbs, mace, cloves, carrots, onions, and lemon-peel. When perfectly
tender, lift them out and remove any bones or hard parts remaining. Put them between two dishes,
with a weight on the top, and when cold, cut them into slices. Brush these over with egg, sprinkle
with bread crumbs, and fry a pale brown. Take 1/2 pint of the gravy they were boiled in, add
2 tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, a seasoning of salt and pepper, the sherry, and the
yolk of an egg beaten with 3 tablespoonfuls of cream. Stir the sauce over the fire until it
thickens; when it is on the point of boiling, dish the tendrons in a circle, and pour the sauce
in the middle. Tendrons are dressed in a variety of ways,--with sauce à l'Espagnole, vegetables
of all kinds: when they are served with a purée, they should always be glazed.

Time.--4-1/2 hours. Average cost.--Usually bought with breast of veal.

Sufficient for an entrée.

Seasonable from March to October.

TETE DE VEAU EN TORTUE (an Entree).

911. INGREDIENTS.--Half a calf's head, or the remains of a cold boiled one; rather more than
1 pint of good white stock, No. 107, 1 glass of sherry or Madeira, cayenne and salt to taste,
about 12 mushroom-buttons (when obtainable), 6 hard-boiled eggs, 4 gherkins, 8 quenelles or
forcemeat balls, No. 422 or 423, 12 crayfish, 12 croûtons.

Mode.--Half a calf's head is sufficient to make a good entrée, and if there are any remains
of a cold one left from the preceding day, it will answer very well for this dish. After boiling
the head until tender, remove the bones, and cut the meat into neat pieces; put the stock into
a stewpan, add the wine, and a seasoning of salt and cayenne; fry the mushrooms in butter for
2 or 3 minutes, and add these to the gravy. Boil this quickly until somewhat reduced; then
put in the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs whole, the whites cut in small pieces, and the gherkins
chopped. Have ready a few veal quenelles, made by recipe No. 422 or 423; add these, with the
slices of head, to the other ingredients, and let the whole get thoroughly hot, without boiling.
Arrange the pieces of head as high in the centre of the dish as possible; pour over them the
ragout, and garnish with the crayfish and croûtons placed alternately. A little of the gravy
should also be served in a tureen.

Time.--About 1/2 hour to reduce the stock.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Average cost, exclusive of the calf's head, 2s. 9d.

Seasonable from March to October.

    A FRENCHMAN'S OPINION OF VEAL.--A great authority in his native
    Paris tells us, that veal, as a meat, is but little nourishing,
    is relaxing, and sufficiently difficult of digestion. Lending
    itself, as it does, he says, in all the flowery imagery of the
    French tongue and manner, "to so many metamorphoses, it may be
    called, without exaggeration, the chameleon of the kitchen. Who
    has not eaten calf's head au naturel, simply boiled with the
    skin on, its flavour heightened by sauce just a little sharp? It
    is a dish as wholesome as it is agreeable, and one that the most
    inexperienced cook may serve with success. Calf's feet à la
    poulette, au gratin, fried, &c.; les cervelles, served in
    the same manner, and under the same names; sweetbreads en
    fricandeau, piqués en fin,--all these offer most satisfactory
    entrées, which the art of the cook, more or less, varies for the
    gratification of his glory and the well-being of our appetites.
    We have not spoken, in the above catalogue, either of the liver,
    or of the fraise, or of the ears, which also share the honour
    of appearing at our tables. Where is the man not acquainted with
    calf's liver à la bourgeoise, the most frequent and convenient
    dish at unpretentious tables? The fraise, cooked in water, and
    eaten with vinegar, is a wholesome and agreeable dish, and
    contains a mucilage well adapted for delicate persons. Calf's
    ears have, in common with the feet and cervelles, the
    advantage of being able to be eaten either fried or à la
    poulette; and besides, can be made into a farce, with the
    addition of peas, onions, cheese, &c. Neither is it confined to
    the calf's tongue, or even the eyes, that these shall dispute
    alone the glory of awakening the taste of man; thus, the
    fressure (which, as is known, comprises the heart, the mou,
    and the rate), although not a very recherché dish, lends
    itself to all the caprices of an expert artist, and may, under
    various marvellous disguises, deceive, and please, and even
    awaken our appetite."--Verily, we might say, after this rhapsody
    of our neighbour, that his country's weal will not suffer in him
    as an able and eloquent exponent and admirer.

VEAL CARVING.

BREAST OF VEAL.

912. The carving of a breast of veal is not dissimilar to that of a fore-quarter of lamb, when
the shoulder has been taken off. The breast of veal consists of two parts,--the rib-bones and
the gristly brisket. These two parts should first be separated by sharply passing the knife
in the direction of the lines 1, 2; when they are entirely divided, the rib-bones should be
carved in the direction of the lines 5 to 6; and the brisket can be helped by cutting pieces
in the direction 3 to 4. The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for
the brisket or ribs; and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish, as it often is with
roast breast of veal, each person should receive a piece.

CALF'S HEAD.

913. This is not altogether the most easy-looking dish to cut when it is put before a carver
for the first time; there is not much real difficulty in the operation, however, when the head
has been attentively examined, and, after the manner of a phrenologist, you get to know its
bumps, good and bad. In the first place, inserting the knife quite down to the bone, cut slices
in the direction of the line 1 to 2; with each of these should be helped a piece of what is
called the throat sweetbread, cut in the direction of from 3 to 4. The eye, and the flesh round,
are favourite morsels with many, and should be given to those at the table who are known to
be the greatest connoisseurs. The jawbone being removed, there will then be found some nice
lean; and the palate, which is reckoned by some a tit-bit, lies under the head. On a separate
dish there is always served the tongue and brains, and each guest should be asked to take some
of these.

FILLET OF VEAL.

914. The carving of this joint is similar to that of a round of beef. Slices, not too thick,
in the direction of the line 1 to 2 are cut; and the only point to be careful about is, that
the veal be evenly carved. Between the flap and the meat the stuffing is inserted, and a small
portion of this should be served to every guest. The persons whom the host wishes most to honour
should be asked if they like the delicious brown outside slice, as this, by many, is exceedingly
relished.

KNUCKLE OF VEAL.

915. The engraving, showing the dotted line from 1 to 2, sufficiently indicates the direction
which should be given to the knife in carving this dish. The best slices are those from the
thickest part of the knuckle, that is, outside the line 1 to 2.

LOIN OF VEAL.

916. As is the case with a loin of mutton, the careful jointing of a loin of veal is more than
half the battle in carving it. If the butcher be negligent in this matter, he should be admonished;
for there is nothing more annoying or irritating to an inexperienced carver than to be obliged
to turn his knife in all directions to find the exact place where it should be inserted in
order to divide the bones. When the jointing is properly performed, there is little difficulty
in carrying the knife down in the direction of the line 1 to 2. To each guest should be given
a piece of the kidney and kidney fat, which lie underneath, and are considered great delicacies.

CHAPTER XX.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS.

  "Birds, the free tenants of land, air, and ocean,
  Their forms all symmetry, their motions grace;
  In plumage delicate and beautiful;
  Thick without burthen, close as fishes' scales,
  Or loose as full-blown poppies to the breeze."

The Pelican Island.

917. THE DIVISIONS OF BIRDS are founded principally on their habits of life, and the natural
resemblance which their external parts, especially their bills, bear to each other. According
to Mr. Vigors, there are five orders, each of which occupies its peculiar place on the surface
of the globe; so that the air, the forest, the land, the marsh, and the water, has each its
appropriate kind of inhabitants. These are respectively designated as BIRDS OF PREY, PERCHERS,
WALKERS, WADERS, and SWIMMERS; and, in contemplating their variety, lightness, beauty, and
wonderful adaptation to the regions they severally inhabit, and the functions they are destined
to perform in the grand scheme of creation, our hearts are lifted with admiration at the exhaustless
ingenuity, power, and wisdom of HIM who has, in producing them, so strikingly "manifested His
handiwork." Not only these, however, but all classes of animals, have their peculiar ends to
fulfil; and, in order that this may be effectually performed, they are constructed in such
a manner as will enable them to carry out their conditions. Thus the quadrupeds, that are formed
to tread the earth in common with man, are muscular and vigorous; and, whether they have passed
into the servitude of man, or are permitted to range the forest or the field, they still retain,
in a high degree, the energies with which they were originally endowed. Birds, on the contrary,
are generally feeble, and, therefore, timid. Accordingly, wings have been given them to enable
them to fly through the air, and thus elude the force which, by nature, they are unable to
resist. Notwithstanding the natural tendency of all bodies towards the centre of the earth,
birds, when raised in the atmosphere, glide through it with the greatest ease, rapidity, and
vigour. There, they are in their natural element, and can vary their course with the greatest
promptitude--can mount or descend with the utmost facility, and can light on any spot with
the most perfect exactness, and without the slightest injury to themselves.

918. THE MECHANISM WHICH ENABLES BIRDS to wing their course through the air, is both singular
and instructive. Their bodies are covered with feathers, which are much lighter than coverings
of hair, with which quadrupeds are usually clothed. The feathers are so placed as to overlap
each other, like the slates or the tiles on the roof of a house. They are also arranged from
the fore-part backwards; by which the animals are enabled the more conveniently to cut their
way through the air. Their bones are tubular or hollow, and extremely light compared with those
of terrestrial animals. This greatly facilitates their rising from the earth, whilst their
heads, being comparatively small, their bills shaped like a wedge, their bodies slender, sharp
below, and round above,--all these present a union of conditions, favourable, in the last degree,
to cutting their way through the aërial element to which they are considered as more peculiarly
to belong. With all these conditions, however, birds could not fly without wings. These, therefore,
are the instruments by which they have the power of rapid locomotion, and are constructed in
such a manner as to be capable of great expansion when struck in a downward direction. If we
except, in this action, the slight hollow which takes place on the under-side, they become
almost two planes. In order that the downward action may be accomplished to the necessary extent,
the muscles which move the wings have been made exceedingly large; so large, indeed, that,
in some instances, they have been estimated at not less than a sixth of the weight of the whole
body. Therefore, when a bird is on the ground and intends to fly, it takes a leap, and immediately
stretching its wings, strikes them out with great force. By this act these are brought into
an oblique direction, being turned partly upwards and partly horizontally forwards. That part
of the force which has the upward tendency is neutralized by the weight of the bird, whilst
the horizontal force serves to carry it forward. The stroke being completed, it moves upon
its wings, which, being contracted and having their edges turned upwards, obviate, in a great
measure, the resistance of the air. When it is sufficiently elevated, it makes a second stroke
downwards, and the impulse of the air again moves it forward. These successive strokes may
be regarded as so many leaps taken in the air. When the bird desires to direct its course to
the right or the left, it strikes strongly with the opposite wing, which impels it to the proper
side. In the motions of the animal, too, the tail takes a prominent part, and acts like the
rudder of a ship, except that, instead of sideways, it moves upwards and downwards. If the
bird wishes to rise, it raises its tail; and if to fall, it depresses it; and, whilst in a
horizontal position, it keeps it steady. There are few who have not observed a pigeon or a
crow preserve, for some time, a horizontal flight without any apparent motion of the wings.
This is accomplished by the bird having already acquired sufficient velocity, and its wings
being parallel to the horizon, meeting with but small resistance from the atmosphere. If it
begins to fall, it can easily steer itself upward by means of its tail, till the motion it
had acquired is nearly spent, when it must be renewed by a few more strokes of the wings. On
alighting, a bird expands its wings and tail fully against the air, as a ship, in tacking round,
backs her sails, in order that they may meet with all the resistance possible.

919. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EYES of birds, there is a peculiarity necessary to their condition.
As they pass a great portion of their lives among thickets and hedges, they are provided for
the defence of their eyes from external injuries, as well as from the effects of the light,
when flying in opposition to the rays of the sun, with a nictating or winking membrane, which
can, at pleasure, be drawn over the whole eye like a curtain. This covering is neither opaque
nor wholly pellucid, but is somewhat transparent; and it is by its means that the eagle is
said to be able to gaze at the sun. "In birds," says a writer on this subject, "we find that
the sight is much more piercing, extensive, and exact, than in the other orders of animals.
The eye is much larger in proportion to the bulk of the head, than in any of these. This is
a superiority conferred upon them not without a corresponding utility: it seems even indispensable
to their safety and subsistence. Were this organ in birds dull, or in the least degree opaque,
they would be in danger, from the rapidity of their motion, of striking against various objects
in their flight. In this case their celerity, instead of being an advantage, would become an
evil, and their flight be restrained by the danger resulting from it. Indeed we may consider
the velocity with which an animal moves, as a sure indication of the perfection of its vision.
Among the quadrupeds, the sloth has its sight greatly limited; whilst the hawk, as it hovers
in the air, can espy a lark sitting on a clod, perhaps at twenty times the distance at which
a man or a dog could perceive it."

920. AMONGST THE MANY PECULIARITIES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF BIRDS, not the least is the mode
by which their respiration is accomplished. This is effected by means of air-vessels, which
extend throughout the body, and adhere to the under-surface of the bones. These, by their motion,
force the air through the true lungs, which are very small, and placed in the uppermost part
of the chest, and closely braced down to the back and ribs. The lungs, which are never expanded
by air, are destined to the sole purpose of oxidizing the blood. In the experiments made by
Mr. John Hunter, to discover the use of this general diffusion of air through the bodies of
birds, he found that it prevents their respiration from being stopped or interrupted by the
rapidity of their motion through a resisting medium. It is well known that, in proportion to
celerity of motion, the air becomes resistive; and were it possible for a man to move with
the swiftness of a swallow, as he is not provided with an internal construction similar to
that of birds, the resistance of the air would soon suffocate him.

921. BIRDS ARE DISTRIBUTED OVER EVERY PART OF THE GLOBE, being found in the coldest as well
as the hottest regions, although some species are restricted to particular countries, whilst
others are widely dispersed. At certain seasons of the year, many of them change their abodes,
and migrate to climates better adapted to their temperaments or modes of life, for a time,
than those which they leave. Many of the birds of Britain, directed by an unerring instinct,
take their departure from the island before the commencement of winter, and proceed to the
more congenial warmth of Africa, to return with the next spring. The causes assigned by naturalists
for this peculiarity are, either a deficiency of food, or the want of a secure asylum for the
incubation and nourishment of their young. Their migrations are generally performed in large
companies, and, in the day, they follow a leader, which is occasionally changed. During the
night, many of the tribes send forth a continual cry, to keep themselves together; although
one would think that the noise which must accompany their flight would be sufficient for that
purpose.

922. IF THE BEAUTY OF BIRDS were not a recommendation to their being universally admired, their
general liveliness, gaiety, and song would endear them to mankind. It appears, however, from
accurate observations founded upon experiment, that the notes peculiar to different kinds of
birds are altogether acquired, and that they are not innate, any more than language is to man.
The attempt of a nestling bird to sing has been compared to the endeavour of a child to talk.
The first attempts do not seem to possess the slightest rudiments of the future song; but,
as the bird grows older and becomes stronger, it is easily perceived to be aiming at acquiring
the art of giving utterance to song. Whilst the scholar is thus endeavouring to form his notes,
when he is once sure of a passage, he usually raises his tone, but drops it again when he finds
himself unequal to the voluntary task he has undertaken. "Many well-authenticated facts," says
an ingenious writer, "seem decisively to prove that birds have no innate notes, but that, like
mankind, the language of those to whose care they have been committed at their birth, will
be their language in after-life." It would appear, however, somewhat unaccountable why, in
a wild state, they adhere so steadily to the song of their own species only, when the notes
of so many others are to be heard around them. This is said to arise from the attention paid
by the nestling bird to the instructions of its own parent only, generally disregarding the
notes of all the rest. Persons; however, who have an accurate ear, and who have given their
attention to the songs of birds, can frequently distinguish some which have their notes mixed
with those of another species; but this is in general so trifling, that it can hardly be considered
as more than the mere varieties of provincial dialects.

923. IN REFERENCE TO THE FOOD OF BIRDS, we find that it varies, as it does in quadrupeds, according
to the species. Some are altogether carnivorous; others, as so many of the web-footed tribes,
subsist on fish; others, again, on insects and worms; and others on grain and fruit. The extraordinary
powers of the gizzard of the granivorous tribes, in comminuting their food so as to prepare
it for digestion, would, were they not supported by incontrovertible facts founded on experiment,
appear to exceed all credibility. Tin tubes, full of grain, have been forced into the stomachs
of turkeys, and in twenty-four hours have been found broken, compressed, and distorted into
every shape. Twelve small lancets, very sharp both at the point and edges, have been fixed
in a ball of lead, covered with a case of paper, and given to a turkey-cock, and left in its
stomach for eight hours. After that time the stomach was opened, when nothing appeared except
the naked ball. The twelve lancets were broken to pieces, whilst the stomach remained perfectly
sound and entire. From these facts, it is concluded that the stones, so frequently found in
the stomachs of the feathered tribes, are highly useful in assisting the gastric juices to
grind down the grain and other hard substances which constitute their food. The stones, themselves,
being also ground down and separated by the powerful action of the gizzard, are mixed with
the food, and, no doubt, contribute very greatly to the health, as well as to the nourishment
of the animals.

924. ALL BIRDS BEING OVIPAROUS, the eggs which they produce after the process of incubation,
or sitting for a certain length of time, are, in the various species, different both in figure
and colour, as well as in point of number. They contain the elements of the future young, for
the perfecting of which in the incubation a bubble of air is always placed at the large end,
between the shell and the inside skin. It is supposed that from the heat communicated by the
sitting bird to this confined air, its spring is increased beyond its natural tenor, and, at
the same time, its parts are put into motion by the gentle rarefaction. By this means, pressure
and motion are communicated to the parts of the egg, which, in some inscrutable way, gradually
promote the formation and growth of the young, till the time comes for its escaping from the
shell. To preserve an egg perfectly fresh, and even fit for incubation, for 5 or 6 months after
it has been laid, Réaumur, the French naturalist, has shown that it is only necessary to stop
up its pores with a slight coating of varnish or mutton-suet.

925. BIRDS HOWEVER, DO NOT LAY EGGS before they have some place to put them; accordingly, they
construct nests for themselves with astonishing art. As builders, they exhibit a degree of
architectural skill, niceness, and propriety, that would seem even to mock the imitative talents
of man, however greatly these are marked by his own high intelligence and ingenuity.

                          "Each circumstance
  Most artfully contrived to favour warmth.
  Here read the reason of the vaulted roof;
  How Providence compensates, ever kind,
  The enormous disproportion that subsists
  Between the mother and the numerous brood
  Which her small bulk must quicken into life."

In building their nests, the male and female generally assist each other, and they contrive
to make the outside of their tenement bear as great a resemblance as possible to the surrounding
foliage or branches; so that it cannot very easily be discovered even by those who are in search
of it. This art of nidification is one of the most wonderful contrivances which the wide field
of Nature can show, and which, of itself, ought to be sufficient to compel mankind to the belief,
that they and every other part of the creation, are constantly under the protecting power of
a superintending Being, whose benign dispensations seem as exhaustless as they are unlimited.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXI.

CHICKEN CUTLETS (an Entree).

926. INGREDIENTS.--2 chickens; seasoning to taste of salt, white pepper, and cayenne; 2 blades
of pounded mace, egg and bread crumbs, clarified butter, 1 strip of lemon-rind, 2 carrots,
1 onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, thickening of butter and flour, 1 egg.

Mode.--Remove the breast and leg bones of the chickens; cut the meat into neat pieces after
having skinned it, and season the cutlets with pepper, salt, pounded mace, and cayenne. Put
the bones, trimmings, &c., into a stewpan with 1 pint of water, adding carrots, onions, and
lemon-peel in the above proportion; stew gently for 1-1/2 hour, and strain the gravy. Thicken
it with butter and flour, add the ketchup and 1 egg well beaten; stir it over the fire, and
bring it to the simmering-point, but do not allow it to boil. In the mean time, egg and bread-crumb
the cutlets, and give them a few drops of clarified butter; fry them a delicate brown, occasionally
turning them; arrange them pyramidically on the dish, and pour over them the sauce.

Time.--10 minutes to fry the cutlets. Average cost, 2s. each.

Sufficient for an entrée.

Seasonable from April to July.

    FOWLS AS FOOD.--Brillat Savarin, pre-eminent in gastronomic
    taste, says that he believes the whole gallinaceous family was
    made to enrich our larders and furnish our tables; for, from the
    quail to the turkey, he avers their flesh is a light aliment,
    full of flavour, and fitted equally well for the invalid as for
    the man of robust health. The fine flavour, however, which
    Nature has given to all birds coming under the definition of
    poultry, man has not been satisfied with, and has used many
    means--such as keeping them in solitude and darkness, and
    forcing them to eat--to give them an unnatural state of fatness
    or fat. This fat, thus artificially produced, is doubtless
    delicious, and the taste and succulence of the boiled and
    roasted bird draw forth the praise of the guests around the
    table. Well-fattened and tender, a fowl is to the cook what the
    canvas is to the painter; for do we not see it served boiled,
    roasted, fried, fricasseed, hashed, hot, cold, whole,
    dismembered, boned, broiled, stuffed, on dishes, and in
    pies,--always handy and ever acceptable?

    THE COMMON OR DOMESTIC FOWL.--From time immemorial, the common
    or domestic fowl has been domesticated in England, and is
    supposed to be originally the offspring of some wild species
    which abound in the forests of India. It is divided into a
    variety of breeds, but the most esteemed are, the Poland or
    Black, the Dorking, the Bantam, the Game Fowl, and the Malay or
    Chittagong. The common, or barn-door fowl, is one of the most
    delicate of the varieties; and at Dorking, in Surrey, the breed
    is brought to great perfection. Till they are four months old,
    the term chicken is applied to the young female; after that age
    they are called pullets, till they begin to lay, when they are
    called hens. The English counties most productive in poultry are
    Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk, Herts, Devon, and Somerset.

FRENCH CHICKEN CUTLETS (Cold Meat Cookery).

927. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled fowl, fried bread, clarified butter,
the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs, 1/2 teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel; salt, cayenne,
and mace to taste. For sauce,--1 oz. of butter, 2 minced shalots, a few slices of carrot, a
small bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1 blade of pounded mace, 6 peppercorns, 1/4
pint of gravy.

Mode.--Cut the fowls into as many nice cutlets as possible; take a corresponding number of
sippets about the same size, all cut one shape; fry them a pale brown, put them before the
fire, then dip the cutlets into clarified butter mixed with the yolk of an egg, cover with
bread crumbs seasoned in the above proportion, with lemon-peel, mace, salt, and cayenne; fry
them for about 5 minutes, put each piece on one of the sippets, pile them high in the dish,
and serve with the following sauce, which should be made ready for the cutlets. Put the butter
into a stewpan, add the shalots, carrot, herbs, mace, and peppercorns; fry for 10 minutes or
rather longer; pour in 1/2 pint of good gravy, made of the chicken bones, stew gently for 20
minutes, strain it, and serve.

Time.--5 minutes to fry the cutlets; 35 minutes to make the gravy.

Average cost, exclusive of the chicken, 9d.

Seasonable from April to July.

    EGGS FOR HATCHING.--Eggs intended for hatching should be removed
    as soon as laid, and placed in bran in a dry, cool place. Choose
    those that are near of a size; and, as a rule, avoid those that
    are equally thick at both ends,--such, probably, contain a
    double yolk, and will come to no good. Eggs intended for
    hatching should never be stored longer than a month, as much
    less the better. Nine eggs may be placed under a Bantam hen, and
    as many as fifteen under a Dorking. The odd number is considered
    preferable, as more easily packed. It will be as well to mark
    the eggs you give the hen to sit on, so that you may know if she
    lays any more: if she does, you must remove them; for, if
    hatched at all, they would be too late for the brood. If during
    incubation an egg should be broken, remove it, and take out the
    remainder, and cleanse them in luke-warm water, or it is
    probable the sticky nature of the contents of the broken egg
    will make the others cling to the hen's feathers; and they, too,
    may be fractured.

    HENS SITTING.--Some hens are very capricious as regards sitting;
    they will make a great fuss, and keep pining for the nest, and,
    when they are permitted to take to it, they will sit just long
    enough to addle the eggs, and then they're off again. The safest
    way to guard against such annoyance, is to supply the hen with
    some hard-boiled eggs; if she sits on them a reasonable time,
    and seems steadily inclined, like a good matron, you may then
    give her proper eggs, and let her set about the business in
    earnest.

CHICKEN OR FOWL PATTIES.

928.

Mode.--Mince very small the white meat from a cold roast fowl, after removing all the skin;
weigh it, and to every 1/4 lb. of meat allow the above proportion of minced ham. Put these
into a stewpan with the remaining ingredients, stir over the fire for 10 minutes or 1/4 hour,
taking care that the mixture does not burn. Roll out some puff paste about 1/4 inch in thickness;
line the patty-pans with this, put upon each a small piece of bread, and cover with another
layer of paste; brush over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a brisk oven for about 1/4
hour. When done, cut a round piece out of the top, and, with a small spoon, take out the bread
(be particular in not breaking the outside border of the crust), and fill the patties with
the mixture.

Time.--1/4 hour to prepare the meat; not quite 1/4 hour to bake the crust.

Seasonable at any time.

    HATCHING.--Sometimes the chick within the shell is unable to
    break away from its prison; for the white of the egg will
    occasionally harden in the air to the consistence of joiners'
    clue, when the poor chick is in a terrible fix. An able writer
    says, "Assistance in hatching must not be rendered prematurely,
    and thence unnecessarily, but only in the case of the chick
    being plainly unable to release itself; then, indeed, an
    addition may probably be made to the brood, as great numbers are
    always lost in this way. The chick makes a circular fracture at
    the big end of the egg, and a section of about one-third of the
    length of the shell being separated, delivers the prisoner,
    provided there is no obstruction from adhesion of the body to
    the membrane which lines the shell. Between the body of the
    chick and the membrane of the shell there exists a viscous
    fluid, the white of the egg thickened with the intense heat of
    incubation, until it becomes a positive glue. When this happens,
    the feathers stick fast to the shell, and the chicks remain
    confined, and must perish, if not released."

    The method of assistance to be rendered to chicks which have a
    difficulty in releasing themselves from the shell, is to take
    the egg in the hand, and dipping the finger or a piece of linen
    rag in warm water, to apply it to the fastened parts until they
    are loosened by the gluey substance becoming dissolved and
    separated from the feathers. The chick, then, being returned to
    the nest, will extricate itself,--a mode generally to be
    observed, since, if violence were used, it would prove fatal.
    Nevertheless, breaking the shell may sometimes be necessary; and
    separating with the fingers, as gently as may be, the membrane
    from the feathers, which are still to be moistened as mentioned
    above, to facilitate the operation. The points of small scissors
    may be useful, and when there is much resistance, as also
    apparent pain to the bird, the process must be conducted in the
    gentlest manner, and the shell separated into a number of small
    pieces. The signs of a need of assistance are the egg being
    partly pecked and chipped, and the cluck discontinuing its
    efforts for five of six hours. Weakness from cold may disable
    the chicken from commencing the operation of pecking the shell,
    which must then be artificially performed with a circular
    fracture, such as is made by the bird itself.

CHICKEN OR FOWL PIE.

929.

Mode.--Skin and cut up the fowls into joints, and put the neck, leg, and backbones in a stewpan,
with a little water, an onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a blade of mace; let these stew
for about an hour, and, when done, strain off the liquor: this is for gravy. Put a layer of
fowl at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of ham, then one of forcemeat and hard-boiled
eggs cut in rings; between the layers put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, pepper, and
salt. Proceed in this manner until the dish is full, and pour in about 1/2 pint of water; border
the edge of the dish with puff crust, put on the cover, ornament the top, and glaze it by brushing
over it the yolk of an egg. Bake from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour, should the pie be very large, and,
when done, pour in, at the top, the gravy made from the bones. If to be eaten cold, and wished
particularly nice, the joints of the fowls should be boned, and placed in the dish with alternate
layers of forcemeat; sausage-meat may also be substituted for the forcemeat, and is now very
much used. When the chickens are boned, and mixed with sausage-meat, the pie will take about
2 hours to bake. It should be covered with a piece of paper when about half-done, to prevent
the paste from being dried up or scorched.

Time.--For a pie with unboned meat, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour; with boned meat and sausage or forcemeat,
1-1/2 to 2 hours.

Average cost, with 2 fowls, 6s. 6d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE YOUNG CHICKS.--The chicks that are hatched first should be
    taken from underneath the hen, lest she might think her task at
    an end, and leave the remaining eggs to spoil. As soon as the
    young birds are taken from the mother, they must be placed in a
    basket lined with soft wool, flannel, or hay, and stood in the
    sunlight if it be summer time, or by the fire if the weather be
    cold. It is a common practice to cram young chicks with food as
    soon as they are born. This is quite unnecessary. They will, so
    long as they are kept warm, come to no harm if they take no food
    for twenty-four hours following their birth. Should the whole of
    the brood not be hatched by that time, those that are born may
    be fed with bread soaked in milk, and the yolk of a hard-boiled
    egg.

POTTED CHICKEN OR FOWL (a Luncheon or Breakfast Dish).

930. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast chicken; to every lb. of meat allow 1/4 lb. of
fresh butter, salt and cayenne to taste, 1 teaspoonful of pounded mace, 1/4 small nutmeg.

Mode.--Strip the meat from the bones of cold roast fowl; when it is freed from gristle and
skin, weigh it, and, to every lb. of meat, allow the above proportion of butter, seasoning,
and spices. Cut the meat into small pieces, pound it well with the fresh butter, sprinkle in
the spices gradually, and keep pounding until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste. Put it into
potting-pots for use, and cover it with clarified butter, about 1/4 inch in thickness, and,
if to be kept for some time, tie over a bladder: 2 or 3 slices of ham, minced and pounded with
the above ingredients, will be found an improvement. It should be kept in a dry place.

Seasonable at any time.

    FEEDING AND COOPING THE CHICKS.--When all the chicks are
    hatched, they should be placed along with the mother under a
    coop in a warm dry spot. If two hens happen to have their broods
    at the same time, their respective chicks should be carefully
    kept separate; as, if they get mixed, and so go under the wrong
    coop, the hens will probably maim and destroy those who have
    mistaken their dwelling. After being kept snug beneath the coop
    for a week (the coop should be placed under cover at nightfall),
    the chicks may be turned loose for an hour or so in the warmest
    part of the day. They should be gradually weaned from the soaked
    bread and chopped egg, instead of which grits or boiled barley
    should be given; in 8 or 10 days their stomachs will be strong
    enough to receive bruised barley, and at the end of 3 weeks, if
    your chicks be healthy, they will be able to take care of
    themselves. It will be well, however, to keep your eye on them a
    week or so longer, as the elder chickens may drive them from
    their food. Great care should be taken that the very young
    chicks do not run about the wet ground or on damp grass, as this
    is the most prominent and fatal cause of disease. While under
    the coop with their mother, a shallow pan or plate of water
    should be supplied to the chicks, as in a deeper vessel they are
    liable to drench themselves and take cold, or possibly to get
    drowned.

CHICKEN OR FOWL SALAD.

931. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled chicken, 2 lettuces, a little endive,
1 cucumber, a few slices of boiled beetroot, salad-dressing No. 506.

Mode.--Trim neatly the remains of the chicken; wash, dry, and slice the lettuces, and place
in the middle of a dish; put the pieces of fowl on the top, and pour the salad-dressing over
them. Garnish the edge of the salad with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings, sliced cucumber, and
boiled beetroot cut in slices. Instead of cutting the eggs in rings, the yolks may be rubbed
through a hair sieve, and the whites chopped very finely, and arranged on the salad in small
bunches, yellow and white alternately. This should not be made long before it is wanted for table.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold chicken, 8d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    AGE AND FLAVOUR OF CHICKENS.--It has been the opinion of the
    medical faculty of all ages and all countries, that the flesh of
    the young chicken is the must delicate and easy to digest of all
    animal food. It is less alkalescent than the flesh of any other
    animal, and its entire freedom from any irritating quality
    renders it a fit dish for the ailing, or those whose stomachs
    are naturally weak. In no animal, however, does age work such a
    change, in regard to the quality of its flesh, as it does in
    domestic fowls. In their infancy, cocks and hens are equally
    tender and toothsome; but as time overtakes them it is the cock
    whose flesh toughens first. A year-old cock, indeed, is fit for
    little else than to be converted into soup, while a hen at the
    same age, although sufficiently substantial, is not callous to
    the insinuations of a carving-knife. As regards capons, however,
    the rule respecting age does not hold good. There is scarcely to
    be found a more delicious animal than a well-fed, well-dressed
    capon. Age does not dry up his juices; indeed, like wine, he
    seems but to mellow. At three years old, even, he is as tender
    as a chick, with the additional advantage of his proper chicken
    flavour being fully developed. The above remarks, however,
    concerning the capon, only apply to such as are naturally fed,
    and not crammed. The latter process may produce a
    handsome-looking bird, and it may weigh enough to satisfy the
    whim or avarice of its stuffer; but, when before the fire, it
    will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected,
    and will weep a drippingpan-ful of fat tears. You will never
    find heart enough to place such a grief-worn guest at the head
    of your table. It should be borne in mind as a rule, that
    small-boned and short-legged poultry are likely to excel the
    contrary sort in delicacy of colour, flavour, and fineness of
    flesh.

HASHED DUCK (Cold Meat Cookery).

932. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, rather more than 1 pint of weak stock or
water, 1 onion, 1 oz. of butter, thickening of butter and flour, salt and cayenne to taste,
1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 glass of port wine.

Mode.--Cut the duck into nice joints, and put the trimmings into a stewpan; slice and fry the
onion in a little butter; add these to the trimmings, pour in the above proportion of weak
stock or water, and stew gently for 1 hour. Strain the liquor, thicken it with butter and flour,
season with salt and cayenne, and add the remaining ingredients; boil it up and skim well;
lay in the pieces of duck, and let them get thoroughly hot through by the side of the fire,
but do not allow them to boil: they should soak in the gravy for about 1/2 hour. Garnish with
sippets of toasted bread. The hash may be made richer by using a stronger and more highly-flavoured
gravy; a little spice or pounded mace may also be added, when their flavour is liked.

Seasonable from November to February; ducklings from May to August.

    THE DUCK.--This bird belongs to the order of Natatores, or
    Swimmers; the most familiar tribes of which are ducks, swans,
    geese, auks, penguins, petrels, pelicans, guillemots, gulls, and
    terns. They mostly live in the water, feeding on fish, worms,
    and aquatic plants. They are generally polygamous, and make
    their nests among reeds, or in moist places. The flesh of many
    of the species is eatable, but that of some is extremely rank
    and oily. The duck is a native of Britain, but is found on the
    margins of most of the European lakes. It is excessively greedy,
    and by no means a nice feeder. It requires a mixture of
    vegetable and animal food; but aquatic insects, corn, and
    vegetables, are its proper food. Its flesh, however, is savoury,
    being not so gross as that of the goose, and of easier
    digestion. In the green-pea season it is usually found on an
    English table; but, according to Ude, "November is its proper
    season, when it is plump and fat."

TO RAGOUT A DUCK WHOLE.

933. INGREDIENTS.--1 large duck, pepper and salt to taste, good beef gravy, 2 onions sliced,
4 sage-leaves, a few leaves of lemon thyme, thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--After having emptied and singed the duck, season it inside with pepper and salt, and
truss it. Roast it before a clear fire for about 20 minutes, and let it acquire a nice brown
colour. Put it into a stewpan with sufficient well-seasoned beef gravy to cover it; slice and
fry the onions, and add these, with the sage-leaves and lemon thyme, both of which should be
finely minced, to the stock. Simmer gently until the duck is tender; strain, skim, and thicken
the gravy with a little butter and flour; boil it up, pour over the duck, and serve. When in
season, about, 1-1/2 pint of young green peas, boiled separately, and put in the ragoût, very
much improve this dish.

Time.--20 minutes to roast the duck; 20 minutes to stew it.

Average cost, from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. each.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from November to February; ducklings from April to August.

    THE BUENOS AYRES DUCK.--The Buenos Ayres duck is of East-Indian
    birth, and is chiefly valuable as an ornament; for we suppose
    one would as soon think of picking a Chinese teal for luncheon,
    or a gold fish for breakfast, as to consign the handsome Buenos
    Ayres to the spit. The prevailing colour of this bird is black,
    with a metallic lustre, and a gleaming of blue steel about its
    breast and wings.

    VARIETIES OF DUCKS.--Naturalists count nearly a hundred
    different species of ducks; and there is no doubt that the
    intending keeper of these harmless and profitable birds may
    easily take his choice from amongst twenty different sorts.
    There is, however, so little difference in the various members
    of the family, either as regards hardiness, laying, or hatching,
    that the most incompetent fancier or breeder may indulge his
    taste without danger of making a bad bargain. In connection with
    their value for table, light-coloured ducks are always of milder
    flavour than those that are dark-coloured, the white Aylesbury's
    being general favourites. Ducks reared exclusively on vegetable
    diet will have a whiter and more delicate flesh than those
    allowed to feed on animal offal; while the flesh of birds
    fattened on the latter food, will be firmer than that of those
    which have only partaken of food of a vegetable nature.

ROAST DUCKS.

934. INGREDIENTS.--A couple of ducks; sage-and-onion stuffing No. 504; a little flour.

Choosing and Trussing.--Choose ducks with plump bellies, and with thick and yellowish feet.
They should be trussed with the feet on, which should be scalded, and the skin peeled off,
and then turned up close to the legs. Run a skewer through the middle of each leg, after having
drawn them as close as possible to the body, to plump up the breast, passing the same quite
through the body. Cut off the heads and necks, and the pinions at the first joint; bring these
close to the sides, twist the feet round, and truss them at the back of the bird. After the
duck is stuffed, both ends should be secured with string, so as to keep in the seasoning.

Mode.--To insure ducks being tender, never dress them the same day they are killed; and if
the weather permits, they should hang a day or two. Make a stuffing of sage and onion sufficient
for one duck, and leave the other unseasoned, as the flavour is not liked by everybody. Put
them down to a brisk clear fire, and keep them well basted the whole of the time they are cooking.
A few minutes before serving, dredge them lightly with flour, to make them froth and look plump;
and when the steam draws towards the fire, send them to table hot and quickly, with a good
brown gravy poured round, but not over the ducks, and a little of the same in a tureen. When
in season, green peas should invariably accompany this dish.

Time.--Full-grown ducks from 3/4 to 1 hour; ducklings from 25 to 35 minutes.

Average cost, from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. each.

Sufficient.--A. couple of ducks for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable.--Ducklings from April to August; ducks from November to February.

Note.--Ducklings are trussed and roasted in the same manner, and served with the same sauces
and accompaniments. When in season, serve apple sauce.

    THE ROUEN DUCK.--The Rouen, or Rhone duck, is a large and
    handsome variety, of French extraction. The plumage of the Rouen
    duck is somewhat sombre; its flesh is also much darker, and,
    though of higher flavour, not near so delicate as that of our
    own Aylesbury. It is with this latter breed that the Rouen duck
    is generally mated; and the result is said to be increase of
    size and strength. In Normandy and Brittany these ducks, as well
    as other sorts, greatly abound; and the "duck-liver pâtés" are
    there almost as popular as the pâté de foie gras of Strasburg.
    In order to bring the livers of the wretched duck to the
    fashionable and unnatural size, the same diabolical cruelty is
    resorted to as in the case of the Strasburg goose. The poor
    birds are nailed by the feet to a board placed close to a
    fire, and, in that position, plentifully supplied with food and
    water. In a few days, the carcase is reduced to a mere shadow,
    while the liver has grown monstrously. We would rather abstain
    from the acquaintance of a man who ate pâté de foie gras,
    knowing its component parts.

    DUCK'S EGGS.--The ancient notion that ducks whose beaks have a
    tendency to curve upwards, are better layers than those whose
    beaks do not thus point, is, we need hardly say, simply absurd:
    all ducks are good layers, if they are carefully fed and tended.
    Ducks generally lay at night, or early in the morning. While
    they are in perfect health, they will do this; and one of the
    surest signs of indisposition, among birds of this class, is
    irregularity in laying. The eggs laid will approach nearly the
    colour of the layer,--light-coloured ducks laying white eggs,
    and brown ducks greenish-blue eggs; dark-coloured birds laying
    the largest eggs. One time of day the notion was prevalent that
    a duck would hatch no other eggs than her own; and although this
    is not true, it will be, nevertheless, as well to match the
    duck's own eggs as closely as possible; for we have known
    instances wherein the duck has turned out of the nest and
    destroyed eggs differing from her own in size and colour.

    DUCKS.--The Mallard, or Wild Duck, from which is derived the
    domestic species, is prevalent throughout Europe, Asia, and
    America. The mallard's most remarkable characteristic is one
    which sets at defiance the speculations of the most profound
    ornithologist. The female bird is extremely plain, but the
    male's plumage is a splendour of greens and browns, and browns
    and blues. In the spring, however, the plumage of the male
    begins to fade, and in two months, every vestige of his finery
    has departed, and he is not to be distinguished from his
    soberly-garbed wife. Then the greens, and the blues, and the
    browns begin to bud out again, and by October he is once more a
    gorgeous drake. It is to be regretted that domestication has
    seriously deteriorated the moral character of the duck. In a
    wild state, he is a faithful husband, desiring but one wife, and
    devoting himself to her; but no sooner is he domesticated than
    he becomes polygamous, and makes nothing of owning ten or a
    dozen wives at a time. As regards the females, they are much
    more solicitous for the welfare of their progeny in a wild state
    than a tame. Should a tame duck's duckling get into mortal
    trouble, its mother will just signify her sorrow by an extra
    "quack," or so, and a flapping of her wings; but touch a wild
    duck's little one if you dare! she will buffet you with her
    broad wings, and dash boldly at your face with her stout beak.
    If you search for her nest amongst the long grass, she will try
    no end of manoeuvres to lure you from it, her favourite ruse
    being to pretend lameness, to delude you into the notion that
    you have only to pursue her vigorously, and her capture is
    certain; so you persevere for half a mile or so, and then she is
    up and away, leaving you to find your way back to the nest if
    you can. Among the ancients, opinion was at variance respecting
    the wholesomeness and digestibility of goose flesh, but
    concerning the excellence of the duck all parties were agreed;
    indeed, they not only assigned to duck-meat the palm for
    exquisite flavour and delicacy, they even attributed to it
    medicinal powers of the highest order. Not only the Roman
    medical writers of the time make mention of it, but likewise the
    philosophers of the period. Plutarch assures us that Cato
    preserved his whole household in health, in a season when plague
    and disease were rife, through dieting them on roast duck.

STEWED DUCK AND PEAS (Cold Meat Cookery).

935.

Mode.--Put the butter into a stewpan; cut up the duck into joints, lay them in with the slices
of lean ham or bacon; make it brown, then dredge in a tablespoonful of flour, and stir this
well in before adding the gravy. Put in the onion, parsley, cloves, and gravy, and when it
has simmered for 1/4 hour, add a pint of young green peas, and stew gently for about 1/2 hour.
Season with cayenne, salt, and sugar; take out the duck, place it round the dish, and the peas
in the middle.

Seasonable from June to August.

    DUCKS HATCHING.--Concerning incubation by ducks, a practised
    writer says, "The duck requires a secret and safe place, rather
    than any attendance, and will, at nature's call, cover her eggs
    and seek her food. On hatching, there is not often a necessity
    for taking away any of the brood; and, having hatched, let the
    mother retain her young ones upon the nest her own time. On her
    moving with her brood, let a coop be prepared upon the short
    grass, if the weather be fine, and under shelter, if otherwise."

    COOPING AND FEEDING DUCKLINGS.--Brood ducks should be cooped at
    some distance from any other. A wide and flat dish of water, to
    be often renewed, should stand just outside the coop, and
    barley, or any other meal, be the first food of the ducklings.
    It will be needful, if it be wet weather, to clip their tails,
    lest these draggle, and so weaken the bird. The period of the
    duck's confinement to the coop will depend on the weather, and
    on the strength of the ducklings. A fortnight is usually the
    extent of time necessary, and they may even be sometimes
    permitted to enjoy the luxury of a swim at the end of a week.
    They should not, however, be allowed to stay too long in the
    water at first; for they will then become ill, their feathers
    get rough, and looseness of the bowels ensue. In the latter
    case, let them be closely cooped for a few days, and bean-meal
    or oatmeal be mixed with their ordinary food.

    THE AYLESBURY DUCK.--The white Aylesbury duck is, and
    deservedly, a universal favourite. Its snowy plumage and
    comfortable comportment make it a credit to the poultry-yard,
    while its broad and deep breast, and its ample back, convey the
    assurance that your satisfaction will not cease at its death. In
    parts of Buckinghamshire, this member of the duck family is bred
    on an extensive scale; not on plains and commons, however, as
    might be naturally imagined, but in the abodes of the cottagers.
    Round the walls of the living-rooms, and of the bedroom even,
    are fixed rows of wooden boxes, lined with hay; and it is the
    business of the wife and children to nurse and comfort the
    feathered lodgers, to feed the little ducklings, and to take the
    old ones out for an airing. Sometimes the "stock" ducks are the
    cottager's own property, but it more frequently happens that
    they are intrusted to his care by a wholesale breeder, who pays
    him so much per score for all ducklings properly raised. To be
    perfect, the Aylesbury duck should be plump, pure white, with
    yellow feet, and a flesh-coloured beak.

STEWED DUCK AND PEAS (Cold Meat Cookery).

936.

Mode.--Cut up the duck into joints, lay it in the gravy, and add a seasoning of cayenne, salt,
and minced lemon-peel; let tins gradually warm through, but not boil. Throw the peas into boiling
water slightly salted, and boil them rapidly until tender. Drain them, stir in the pounded
sugar, and the butter rolled in flour; shake them over the fire for two or three minutes, and
serve in the centre of the dish, with the duck laid round.

Time.--15 minutes to boil the peas, when they are full grown.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold duck, 10d.

Seasonable from June to August.

    FATTENING DUCKS.--Many duck-keepers give their birds nothing in
    the shape of food, letting them wander about and pick up a
    living for themselves; and they will seem to get fat even upon
    this precarious feeding. Unless, however, ducks are supplied
    with, besides chance food, a liberal feed of solid corn, or
    grain, morning and evening, their flesh will become flabby and
    insipid. The simple way to fatten ducks is to let them have as
    much, substantial food as they will eat, bruised oats and
    pea-meal being the standard fattening food for them. No cramming
    is required, as with the turkey and some other poultry: they
    will cram themselves to the very verge of suffocation. At the
    same time, plenty of exercise and clean water should be at their
    service.

    AMERICAN MODE OF CAPTURING DUCKS.--On the American rivers, the
    modes of capture are various. Sometimes half a dozen artificial
    birds are fastened to a little raft, and which is so weighted
    that the sham birds squat naturally on the water. This is quite
    sufficient to attract the notice of a passing flock, who descend
    to cultivate the acquaintance of the isolated few when the
    concealed hunter, with his fowling-piece, scatters a deadly
    leaden shower amongst them. In the winter, when the water is
    covered with rubble ice, the fowler of the Delaware paints his
    canoe entirely white, lies flat in the bottom of it, and floats
    with the broken ice; from which the aquatic inhabitants fail to
    distinguish it. So floats the canoe till he within it
    understands, by the quacking, and fluttering, and whirring of
    wings, that he is in the midst of a flock, when he is up in a
    moment with the murderous piece, and dying quacks and
    lamentations rend the still air.

    Bow-BILL DUCKS, &c.--Every one knows how awkward are the
    Anatidae, waddling along on their unelastic webbed toes, and
    their short legs, which, being placed considerably backward,
    make the fore part of the body preponderate. Some, however, are
    formed more adapted to terrestrial habits than others, and
    notably amongst these may be named Dendronessa sponsa, the
    summer duck of America. This beautiful bird rears her young in
    the holes of trees, generally overhanging the water. When strong
    enough, the young scramble to the mouth of the hole, launch into
    the air with their little wings and feet spread out, and drop
    into their favourite element. Whenever their birthplace is at
    some distance from the water, the mother carries them to it, one
    by one, in her bill, holding them so as not to injure their yet
    tender frame. On several occasions, however, when the hole was
    30, 40, or more yards from a piece of water, Audubon observed
    that the mother suffered the young to fall on the grass and
    dried leaves beneath the tree, and afterwards led them directly
    to the nearest edge of the next pool or creek. There are some
    curious varieties of the domestic duck, which only appear
    interesting from their singularity, for there does not seem to
    be anything of use or value in the unusual characteristics which
    distinguish them; thus, the bow-bill duck, as shown in the
    engraving, called by some writers the hook-bill, is remarkable
    for the peculiarly strange distortion of its beak, and the tuft
    on the top of its head. The penguin duck, again, waddles in an
    upright position, like the penguin, on account of the unnatural
    situation of its legs. These odd peculiarities add nothing of
    value to the various breeds, and may be set down as only the
    result of accidental malformation, transmitted from generation
    to generation.

STEWED DUCK AND TURNIPS (Cold Meat Cookery).

937.

Mode.--Cut up the duck into joints, fry the shalots, carrots, and herbs, and put them, with
the duck, into the gravy; add the pounded mace, and stew gently for 20 minutes or 1/2 hour.
Cut about 1 lb. of turnips, weighed after being peeled, into 1/2-inch squares, put the butter
into a stewpan, and stew them till quite tender, which will be in about 1/2 hour, or rather
more; season with pepper and salt, and serve in the centre of the dish, with the duck, &c.
laid round.

Time.--Rather more than 1/2 hour to stew the turnips.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold duck, 1s.

Seasonable from November to February.

    THE WILD DUCK.--In many parts of England the wild duck is to be
    found, especially in those desolate fenny parts where water
    abounds. In Lincolnshire they are plentiful, and are annually
    taken in the decoys, which consist of ponds situate in the
    marshes, and surrounded with wood or reeds to prevent the birds
    which frequent them from, being disturbed. In these the birds
    sleep during the day; and as soon as evening sets in, the decoy
    rises, and the wild fowl feed during the night. Now is the time
    for the decoy ducks to entrap the others. From the ponds
    diverge, in different directions, certain canals, at the end of
    which funnel nets are placed; along these the decoy ducks,
    trained for the purpose, lead the others in search of food.
    After they have got a certain length, a decoy-man appears, and
    drives them further on, until they are finally taken in the
    nets. It is from these decoys, in Lincolnshire, that the London
    market is mostly supplied. The Chinese have a singular mode of
    catching these ducks. A person wades in the water up to the
    chin, and, having his head covered with an empty calabash,
    approaches the place where the ducks are. As the birds have no
    suspicion of the nature of the object which is concealed under
    the calabash, they suffer its approach, and allow it to move at
    will among their flock. The man, accordingly, walks about in the
    midst of his game, and, whenever he pleases, pulls them by the
    legs under the water, and fixes them to his belt, until he has
    secured as many as he requires, and then moves off as he went
    amongst them, without exciting the slightest suspicion of the
    trick he has been playing them. This singular mode of
    duck-hunting is also practised on the Ganges, the earthen
    vessels of the Hindoos being used instead of calabashes. These
    vessels, being those in which the inhabitants boil their rice,
    are considered, after once being used, as defiled, and are
    accordingly thrown into the river. The duck-takers, finding them
    suitable for their purpose, put them on their heads; and as the
    ducks, from seeing them constantly floating down the stream, are
    familiar with their appearance, they regard them as objects from
    which no danger is to be expected.

    DUCK-SNARES IN THE LINCOLNSHIRE FENS.--The following interesting
    account of how duck-snaring used to be managed in the
    Lincolnshire fens, was published some years ago, in a work
    entitled the "Feathered Tribes."--"In the lakes to which they
    resorted, their favourite haunts were observed, and in the most
    sequestered part of a haunt, a pipe or ditch was cut across the
    entrance, decreasing gradually in width from the entrance to the
    further end, which was not more than two feet wide. The ditch
    was of a circular form, but did not bend much for the first ten
    yards. The banks of the lake on each side of the ditch were kept
    clear of weeds and close herbage, in order that the ducks might
    get on them to sit and dress themselves. Along the ditch, poles
    were driven into the ground close to the edge on each side, and
    the tops were bent over across the ditch and tied together. The
    poles then bent forward at the entrance to the ditch, and formed
    an arch, the top of which was tea feet distant from the surface
    of the water; the arch was made to decrease in height as the
    ditch decreased in width, so that the remote end was not more
    than eighteen inches in height. The poles were placed about six
    feet from each other, and connected by poles laid lengthwise
    across the arch, and tied together. Over the whole was thrown a
    net, which was made fast to a reed fence at the entrance and
    nine or ten yards up the ditch, and afterwards strongly pegged
    to the ground. At the end of the ditch furthest from the
    entrance, was fixed what was called a tunnel-net, of about four
    yards in length, of a round form, and kept open by a number of
    hoops about eighteen inches in diameter, placed at a small
    distance from each other to keep it distended. Supposing the
    circular bend of the ditch to be to the right, when one stands
    with his back to the lake, then on the left-hand side, a number
    of reed fences were constructed, called shootings, for the
    purpose of screening the decoy-man from observation, and, in
    such a manner, that the fowl in the decoy would not be alarmed
    while he was driving those that were in the pipe. These
    shootings, which were ten in number, were about four yards in
    length and about six feet high. From the end of the last
    shooting a person could not see the lake, owing to the bend of
    the ditch; and there was then no further occasion for shelter.
    Were it not for these shootings, the fowl that remained about
    the mouth of the ditch would have been alarmed, if the person
    driving the fowl already under the net should have been exposed,
    and would have become so shy as entirely to forsake the place."

    THE DECOY MAN, DOG, AND DUCKS.--"The first thing the decoy-man
    did, on approaching the ditch, was to take a piece of lighted
    peat or turf, and to hold it near his mouth, to prevent the
    birds from smelling him. He was attended by a dog trained to
    render him assistance. He walked very silently about halfway up
    the shootings, where a small piece of wood was thrust through
    the reed fence, which made an aperture just large enough to
    enable him to see if there were any fowl within; if not, he
    walked to see if any were about the entrance to the ditch. If
    there were, he stopped, made a motion to his dog, and gave him a
    piece of cheese to eat, when the dog went directly to a hole
    through the reed fence, and the birds immediately flew off the
    back into the water. The dog returned along the bank between the
    reed fences, and came out to his master at another hole. The man
    then gave the dog something more to encourage him, and the dog
    repeated his rounds, till the birds were attracted by his
    motions, and followed him into the mouth of the ditch--an
    operation which was called 'working them.' The man now retreated
    further back, working the dog at different holes, until the
    ducks were sufficiently under the net. He then commanded his dog
    to lie down under the fence, and going himself forward to the
    end of the ditch next the lake, he took off his hat, and gave it
    a wave between the shootings. All the birds that were under the
    net could then see him, but none that were in the lake could.
    The former flew forward, and the man then ran to the next
    shooting, and waved his hat, and so on, driving them along until
    they came into the tunnel-net, into which they crept. When they
    were all in, the man gave the net a twist, so as to prevent them
    getting back. He then took the net off from the end of the
    ditch, and taking out, one by one, the ducks that were in it,
    dislocated their necks."

BOILED FOWLS OR CHICKENS.

938. INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls; water.

Choosing and Trussing.--In choosing fowls for boiling, it should be borne in mind that those
that are not black-legged are generally much whiter when dressed. Pick, draw, singe, wash,
and truss them in the following manner, without the livers in the wings; and, in drawing, be
careful not to break the gall-bladder:--Cut off the neck, leaving sufficient skin to skewer
back. Cut the feet off to the first joint, tuck the stumps into a slit made on each side of
the belly, twist the wings over the back of the fowl, and secure the top of the leg and the
bottom of the wing together by running a skewer through them and the body. The other side must
be done in the same manner. Should the fowl be very large and old, draw the sinews of the legs
before tucking them in. Make a slit in the apron of the fowl, large enough to admit the parson's
nose, and tie a string on the tops of the legs to keep them in their proper place.

Mode.--When, they are firmly trussed, put them into a stewpan with plenty of hot water; bring
it to boil, and carefully remove all the scum as it rises. Simmer very gently until the fowl
is tender, and bear in mind that the slower it boils, the plumper and whiter will the fowl
be. Many cooks wrap them in a floured cloth to preserve the colour, and to prevent the scum
from clinging to them; in this case, a few slices of lemon should be placed on the breasts;
over these a sheet of buttered paper, and then the cloth; cooking them in this manner renders
the flesh very white. Boiled ham, bacon, boiled tongue, or pickled pork, are the usual accompaniments
to boiled fowls, and they may be served with Béchamel, white sauce, parsley and butter, oyster,
lemon, liver, celery, or mushroom sauce. A little should be poured over the fowls, after the
skewers are removed, and the remainder sent in a tureen to table.

Time.--Large fowl, 1 hour; moderate-sized one, 3/4 hour; chicken, from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.

Average cost, in full season, 5s. the pair.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but scarce in early spring.

    THE GAME FOWL.--Respecting the period at which this well-known
    member of the Gallus family became domesticated, history is
    silent. There is little doubt, however, that, like the dog, it
    has been attached to mankind ever since mankind were attached to
    civilization. Although the social position of this bird is, at
    the present time, highly respectable, it is nothing to what it
    was when Rome was mistress of the world. Writing at that period,
    Pliny says, respecting the domestic cock, "The gait of the cock
    is proud and commanding; he walks with head erect and elevated
    crest; alone, of all birds, he habitually looks up to the sky,
    raising, at the same time, his curved and scythe-formed tail,
    and inspiring terror in the lion himself, that most intrepid of
    animals.----They regulate the conduct of our magistrates, and
    open or close to them their own houses. They prescribe rest or
    movement to the Roman fasces: they command or prohibit battles.
    In a word, they lord it over the masters of the world." As well
    among the ancient Greeks as the Romans, was the cock regarded
    with respect, and even awe. The former people practised
    divinations by means of this bird. Supposing there to be a doubt
    in the camp as to the fittest day to fight a battle, the letter
    of every day in the week would be placed face downwards, and a
    grain of corn placed on each; then the sacred cock would be let
    loose, and, according to the letters he pecked his corn from, so
    would the battle-time be regulated. On one momentous occasion,
    however, a person inimical to priestly interest officiously
    examined the grain, and found that those lying on the letters
    not wanted were made of wax, and the birds, preferring the true
    grain, left these untouched. It is needless to add that, after
    this, divination through the medium of cocks and grain fell out
    of fashion. Whether or no the learned fowl above alluded to were
    of the "game" breed, is unknown; but that the birds were bred
    for the inhuman sport of fighting many hundred years before the
    Christian era, there can be no doubt. Themistocles, the Athenian
    king, who flourished more than two thousand years ago, took
    advantage of the sight of a pitched battle between two cocks to
    harangue his soldiers on courage. "Observe," said he, "with what
    intrepid valour they fight, inspired by no other motive than
    lore of victory; whereas you have to contend for your religion
    and your liberty, for your wives and children, and for the tombs
    of your ancestors." And to this day his courage has not
    degenerated. He still preserves his bold and elegant gait, his
    sparkling eye, while his wedge-shaped beak and cruel spurs are
    ever ready to support his defiant crow. It is no wonder that the
    breed is not plentiful--first, on account of the few eggs laid
    by the hen; and, secondly, from the incurable pugnacity of the
    chicks. Half fledged broods may be found blind as bats from
    fighting, and only waiting for the least glimmer of sight to be
    at it again. Without doubt, the flesh of game fowls is every way
    superior to that of every chicken of the family.

BROILED FOWL AND MUSHROOM SAUCE.

939. INGREDIENTS.--A large fowl, seasoning, to taste, of pepper and salt, 2 handfuls of button
mushrooms, 1 slice of lean ham, 3/4 pint of thickened gravy, 1 teaspoonful of lemon-juice,
1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Cut the fowl into quarters, roast it until three-parts done, and keep it well basted
whilst at the fire. Take the fowl up, broil it for a few minutes over a clear fire, and season
it with pepper and salt. Have ready some mushroom sauce made in the following manner. Put the
mushrooms into a stewpan with a small piece of butter, the ham, a seasoning of pepper and salt,
and the gravy; simmer these gently for 1/2 hour, add the lemon-juice and sugar, dish the fowl,
and pour the sauce round them.

Time.--To roast the fowl, 35 minutes; to broil it, 10 to 15 minutes.

Average cost, in full season, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable.--In full season from May to January.

    THE BANTAM.--No one will dispute that for beauty, animation,
    plumage, and courage the Bantam is entitled to rank next to the
    game fowl. As its name undoubtedly implies, the bird is of
    Asiatic origin. The choicest sorts are the buff-coloured, and
    those that are entirely black. A year-old Bantam cock of pure
    breed will not weigh more than sixteen ounces. Despite its small
    size, however, it is marvellously bold, especially in defence of
    its progeny. A friend of the writer's, residing at Kensington,
    possessed a pair of thorough-bred Bantams, that were allowed the
    range of a yard where a fierce bull-terrier was kennelled. The
    hen had chicks; and, when about three weeks old, one of them
    strayed into the dog-kennel. The grim beast within took no
    notice of the tiny fledgling; but, when the anxious mother
    ventured in to fetch out the truant, with a growl the dog woke,
    and nearly snapped her asunder in his great jaws. The cock bird
    saw the tragic fate of its partner; but, nothing daunted, flew
    at the dog with a fierce cry, and pecked savagely at its face.
    The odds, however, were too great; and, when the terrier had
    sufficiently recovered from the astonishment caused by the
    sudden and unexpected attack, he seized the audacious Bantam,
    and shook him to death; and, in five minutes, the devoted couple
    were entombed in Pincher's capacious maw.

BOILED FOWL AND RICE.

940. INGREDIENTS.--1 fowl, mutton broth, 2 onions, 2 small blades of pounded mace, pepper and
salt to taste, 1/4 pint of rice, parsley and butter.

Mode.--Truss the fowl as for boiling, and put it into a stewpan with sufficient clear well-skimmed
mutton broth to cover it; add the onion, mace, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; stew very
gently for about 1 hour, should the fowl be large, and about 1/2 hour before it is ready put
in the rice, which should be well washed and soaked. When the latter is tender, strain it from
the liquor, and put it on a sieve reversed to dry before the fire, and, in the mean time, keep
the fowl hot. Dish it, put the rice round as a border, pour a little parsley and butter over
the fowl, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.

Time.--A large fowl, 1 hour.

Average cost, in full season, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but scarce in early spring.

    THE DORKING.--This bird takes its name from that of a town in
    Surrey, where the breed is to be found in greater numbers, and
    certainly in greater perfection, than elsewhere. It is generally
    believed that this particular branch of poultry was found in the
    town above mentioned as long ago as the Roman era. The Dorking's
    chief characteristic is that he has five claws on each foot; the
    extra claw, however, is never of sufficient length to encumber
    the foot, or to cause it to "drag" its nest, or scratch out the
    eggs. The colour of the true Dorking is pure white; long in the
    body, short in the legs, and a prolific layer. Thirty years ago,
    there was much controversy respecting the origin of the Dorking.
    The men of Sussex declared that the bird belonged to them, and
    brought birds indigenous to their weald, and possessing all the
    Dorking fine points and peculiarities, in proof of the
    declaration. Others inclined to the belief that the Poland bird
    was the father of the Dorking, and not without at least a show
    of reason, as the former bird much resembles the latter in
    shape; and, despite its sombre hue, it is well known that the
    Poland cock will occasionally beget thorough white stock from
    white English hens. The commotion has, however, long ago
    subsided, and Dorking still retains its fair reputation for
    fowl.

CURRIED FOWL.

941. INGREDIENTS.--1 fowl, 2 oz. of butter, 3 onions sliced, 1 pint of white veal gravy, 1
tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 apple, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream,
1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Put the butter into a stewpan, with the onions sliced, the fowl cut into small joints,
and the apple peeled, cored, and minced. Fry of a pale brown, add the stock, and stew gently
for 20 minutes; rub down the curry-powder and flour with a little of the gravy, quite smoothly,
and stir this to the other ingredients; simmer for rather more than 1/2 hour, and just before
serving, add the above proportion of hot cream and lemon-juice. Serve with boiled rice, which
may either be heaped lightly on a dish by itself, or put round the curry as a border.

Time.--50 minutes.

Average cost, 3s. 3d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable in the winter.

Note.--This curry may be made of cold chicken, but undressed meat will be found far superior.

    THE POLAND.--This bird, a native of Holland, is a great
    favourite with fowl-keepers, especially those who have on eye to
    profit rather than to amusement. Those varieties known as the
    "silver spangled" and the "gold spangled" are handsome enough to
    please the most fastidious; but the common black breed, with the
    bushy crown of white feathers, is but a plain bird. The chief
    value of the common Poland lies in the great number of eggs they
    produce; indeed, in many parts, they are as well known as
    "everlasting layers" as by their proper name. However, the
    experienced breeder would take good care to send the eggs of his
    everlasting layers to market, and not use them for home
    consumption, as, although they may be as large as those laid by
    other hens, the amount of nutriment contained in them is not
    nearly so great. Mr. Mowbray once kept an account of the number
    of eggs produced by this prolific bird, with the following
    result:--From the 25th of October to the 25th of the following
    September five hens laid 503 eggs; the average weight of each
    egg was one ounce five drachms, and the total weight of the
    whole, exclusive of the shells, 50-1/4 pounds. Taking the weight
    of the birds at the fair average of five pounds each, we thus
    see them producing within a year double their weight of egg
    alone; and, supposing every egg to contain a chick, and allowing
    the chick to, grow, in less than eighteen months from the laying
    of the first egg, two thousand five hundred pounds of
    chicken-meat would be the result. The Poland is easily fattened,
    and its flesh is generally considered juicier and of richer
    flavour than most others.

CURRIED FOWL OR CHICKEN (Cold Meat Cookery).

942. Put in the lemon-juice, and serve with boiled rice, either placed in a ridge round the
dish or separately. Two or three shallots or a little garlic may be added, if approved.

Time.--Altogether 1/2 hour. Av. cost, exclusive of the cold fowl, 6d.

Seasonable in the winter.

    THE COCHIN-CHINA.--About fifteen years ago, the arrival of this
    distinguished Asiatic created in England as great a sensation as
    might be expected from the landing of an invading host. The
    first pair that ever made their appearance here were natives of
    Shanghai, and were presented to the queen, who exhibited them at
    the Dublin poultry-show of 1818. Then began the "Cochin"
    furor. As soon as it was discovered, despite the most
    strenuous endeavours to keep the tremendous secret, that a
    certain dealer was possessed of a pair of these birds,
    straightway the avenues to that dealer's shop were blocked by
    broughams, and chariots, and hack cabs, until the shy poulterer
    had been tempted by a sufficiently high sum to part with his
    treasure. Bank-notes were exchanged for Cochin chicks, and
    Cochin eggs were in as great demand as though they had been laid
    by the fabled golden goose. The reign of the Cochin China was,
    however, of inconsiderable duration. The bird that, in 1847,
    would fetch thirty guineas, is now counted but ordinary
    chicken-meat, and its price is regulated according to its weight
    when ready for the spit. As for the precious buff eggs, against
    which, one time of day, guineas were weighed,--send for
    sixpenn'orth at the cheesemonger's, and you will get at least
    five; which is just as it should be. For elegance of shape or
    quality of flesh, the Cochin cannot for a moment stand
    comparison with our handsome dunghill; neither can the
    indescribable mixture of growling and braying, peculiar to the
    former, vie with the musical trumpeting of our own morning
    herald: yet our poultry-breeders have been immense gainers by
    the introduction of the ungainly celestial, inasmuch as new
    blood has been infused into the English chicken family. Of this
    incalculable advantage we may be sure; while, as to the Cochin's
    defects, they are certain to be lost in the process of "cross
    and cross" breeding.

BOILED FOWLS A LA BECHAMEL.

943. INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls, 1 pint of Béchamel, No, 367, a few bunches of boiled brocoli
or cauliflower.

Mode.--Truss and boil the fowls by recipe No. 938; make a pint of Béchamel sauce by recipe
No. 367; pour some of this over the fowls, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Garnish
the dish with bunches of boiled cauliflowers or brocoli, and serve very hot. The sauce should
be made sufficiently thick to adhere to the fowls; that for the tureen should be thinned by
adding a spoonful or two of stock.

Time.--From 1/2 to 1 hour, according to size.

Average cost, in full season, 5s. a pair.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but scarce in early spring.

    SPACE FOR FOWLS.--We are no advocates for converting the
    domestic fowl into a cage-bird. We have known amateur
    fowl-keepers--worthy souls, who would butter the very barley
    they gave their pets, if they thought they would the more enjoy
    it--coop up a male bird and three or four hens in an ordinary
    egg-chest placed on its side, and with the front closely barred
    with iron hooping! This system will not do. Every animal, from
    man himself to the guinea-pig, must have what is vulgarly, but
    truly, known as "elbow-room;" and it must be self-evident how
    emphatically this rule applies to winged animals. It may be
    urged, in the case of domestic fowls, that from constant disuse,
    and from clipping and plucking, and other sorts of maltreatment,
    their wings can hardly be regarded as instruments of flight; we
    maintain, however, that you may pluck a fowl's wing-joints as
    bare as a pumpkin, but you will not erase from his memory that
    he is a fowl, and that his proper sphere is the open air. If he
    likewise reflects that he is an ill-used fowl--a prison-bird--he
    will then come to the conclusion, that there is not the least
    use, under such circumstances, for his existence; and you must
    admit that the decision is only logical and natural.

BOILED FOWL, with Oysters.

(Excellent.)

944. INGREDIENTS.--1 young fowl, 3 dozen oysters, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1/4 pint of cream.

Mode.--Truss a young fowl as for boiling; fill the inside with oysters which have been bearded
and washed in their own liquor; secure the ends of the fowl, put it into a jar, and plunge
the jar into a saucepan of boiling water. Keep it boiling for 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer;
then take the gravy that has flowed from the oysters and fowl, of which there will be a good
quantity; stir in the cream and yolks of eggs, add a few oysters scalded in their liquor; let
the sauce get quite hot, but do not allow it to boil; pour some of it over the fowl, and the
remainder send to table in a tureen. 6d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from September to April.

    THE FOWL-HOUSE.--In building a fowl-house, take care that it be,
    if possible, built against a wall or fence that faces the
    south, and thus insure its inmates against many cold winds,
    driving rains, and sleets they will otherwise suffer. Let the
    floor of the house slope half an inch to the foot from back to
    front, so as to insure drainage; let it also be close, hard, and
    perfectly smooth; so that it may be cleanly swept out. A capital
    plan is to mix a few bushels of chalk and dry earth, spread it
    over the floor, and pay a paviour's labourer a trifle to hammer
    it level with his rammer. The fowl-house should be seven feet
    high, and furnished with perches at least two feet apart. The
    perches must be level, and not one above the other, or
    unpleasant consequences may ensue to the undermost row. The
    perches should be ledged (not fixed--just dropped into sockets,
    that they may be easily taken out and cleaned) not lower than
    five feet from the ground, convenient slips of wood being driven
    into the wall, to render the ascent as easy as possible. The
    front of the fowl-house should be latticed, taking care that the
    interstices be not wide enough even to tempt a chick to crawl
    through. Nesting-boxes, containing soft hay, and fitted against
    the walls, so as to be easily reached by the perch-ladder,
    should be supplied. It will be as well to keep by you a few
    portable doors, so that you may hang one before the entrance to
    a nesting-box, when the hen goes in to sit. This will prevent
    other hens from intruding, a habit to which some are much
    addicted.

FRICASSEED FOWL OR CHICKEN (an Entree).

945. INGREDIENTS.--2 small fowls or 1 large one, 3 oz. of butter, a bunch of parsley and green
onions, 1 clove, 2 blades of mace, 1 shalot, 1 bay-leaf, salt and white pepper to taste, 1/4
pint of cream, the yolks of 3 eggs.

Mode.--Choose a couple of fat plump chickens, and, after drawing, singeing, and washing them,
skin, and carve them into joints; blanch these in boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes; take them
out, and immerse them in cold water to render them white. Put the trimmings, with the necks
and legs, into a stewpan; add the parsley, onions, clove, mace, shalot, bay-leaf, and a seasoning
of pepper and salt; pour to these the water that the chickens were blanched in, and simmer
gently for rather more than 1 hour. Have ready another stewpan; put in the joints of fowl,
with the above proportion of butter; dredge them with flour, let them get hot, but do not brown
them much; then moisten the fricassee with the gravy made from the trimmings, &c., and stew
very gently for 1/2 hour. Lift the fowl into another stewpan, skim the sauce, reduce it quickly
over the fire, by letting it boil fast, and strain it over them. Add the cream, and a seasoning
of pounded mace and cayenne; let it boil up, and when ready to serve, stir to it the well-beaten
yolks of 3 eggs: these should not be put in till the last moment, and the sauce should be made
hot, but must not boil, or it will instantly curdle. A few button-mushrooms stewed with the
fowl are by many persons considered an improvement.

Time.--1 hour to make the gravy, 1/2 hour to simmer the fowl.

Average cost, 5s. the pair.

Sufficient.--1 large fowl for one entrée.

Seasonable at any time.

    STOCKING THE FOWL-HOUSE.--Take care that the birds with which
    you stock your house are young. The surest indications of old
    age are fading of the comb and gills from brilliant red to a
    dingy brick-colour, general paleness of plumage, brittleness of
    the feathers, length and size of the claws, and the scales of
    the legs and feet assuming a ragged and corny appearance. Your
    cock and hens should be as near two years old as possible. Hens
    will lay at a year old, but the eggs are always insignificant in
    size, and the layers giddy and unsteady sitters. The hen-bird is
    in her prime for breeding at three years old, and will continue
    so, under favourable circumstances, for two years longer; after
    which she will decline. Crowing hens, and those that have large
    combs, are generally looked on with mistrust; but this is mere
    silliness and superstition--though it is possible that a spruce
    young cock would as much object to a spouse with such peculiar
    addictions, as a young fellow of our own species would to a
    damsel who whistled and who wore whiskers. Fowls with yellow
    legs should be avoided; they are generally of a tender
    constitution, loose-fleshed, and of indifferent flavour.

FRICASSEED FOWL (Cold Meat Cookery).

946. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 1 blade of pounded
mace, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion, popper and salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful
of flour, 1/4 pint of cream, the yolks of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Carve the fowls into nice joints; make gravy of the trimmings and legs, by stewing them
with the lemon-peel, mace, herbs, onion, seasoning, and water, until reduced to 1/2 pint; then
strain, and put in the fowl. Warm it through, and thicken with a teaspoonful of flour; stir
the yolks of the eggs into the cream; add these to the sauce, let it get thoroughly hot, but
do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.

Time.--1 hour to make the gravy, 1/4 hour to warm the fowl.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold chicken, 8d.

Seasonable at any time.

    CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH AND POWER.--The chief characteristics
    of health in a fowl are brightness and dryness of eye and
    nostrils, the comb and wattles firm and ruddy, the feathers
    elastic and glossy. The most useful cock is generally the
    greatest tyrant, who struts among his hens despotically, with
    his head erect and his eyes ever watchful. There is likely to be
    handsomer and stronger chicks in a house where a bold,
    active--even savage--bird reigns, than where the lord of the
    hen-house is a weak, meek creature, who bears the abuse and
    peckings of his wives without a remonstrance. I much prefer
    dark-coloured cock-birds to those of light plumage. A cock, to
    be handsome, should be of middling size; his bill should be
    short, comb bright-red, wattles large, breast broad, and wings
    strong. His head should be rather small than otherwise, his legs
    short and sturdy, and his spurs well-formed; his feathers should
    be short and close, and the more frequently and heartily he
    crows, the better father he is likely to become. The common
    error of choosing hens above the ordinary stature of their
    respective varieties should be avoided, as the best
    breeding-hens are those of medium size.

FRIED FOWLS (Cold Meat Cookery).

I.

947. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, vinegar, salt and cayenne to taste, 3 or
4 minced shalots. Make the batter by mixing the flour and water smoothly together; melt in
it the butter, and add the whites of egg beaten to a froth; take out the pieces of fowl, dip
them in the batter, and fry, in boiling lard, a nice brown. Pile them high in the dish, and
garnish with fried parsley or rolled bacon. When approved, a sauce or gravy may be served with
them.

Time.--10 minutes to fry the fowl.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold fowl, 8d.

Seasonable at any time.

    CHANTICLEER AND HIS COMPANIONS.--On bringing the male and female
    birds together for the first time, it will be necessary to watch
    the former closely, as it is a very common occurrence with him
    to conceive a sudden and violent dislike for one or more of his
    wives, and not allow the obnoxious ones to approach within some
    distance of the others; indeed, I know many cases where the
    capricious tyrant has set upon the innocent cause of his
    resentment and killed her outright. In all such cases, the hen
    objected to should be removed and replaced by another. If the
    cock should, by any accident, get killed, considerable delicacy
    is required in introducing a new one. The hens may mope, and
    refuse to associate with their new husband, clustering in
    corners, and making odious comparisons between him and the
    departed; or the cock may have his own peculiar notions as to
    what a wife should be, and be by no means satisfied with those
    you have provided him. The plan is, to keep him by himself
    nearly the whole day, supplying him plentifully with
    exhilarating food, then to turn him loose among the hens, and to
    continue this practice, allowing him more of the society of his
    wives each day, until you suffer him to abide with them
    altogether.

II.

948. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, vinegar, salt and cayenne to taste, 4 minced
shalots, yolk of egg; to every teacupful of bread crumbs allow 1 blade of pounded mace, 5 teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel, 1 saltspoonful of salt, a few grains of cayenne.

Mode.--Steep the pieces of fowl as in the preceding recipe, then dip them into the yolk of
an egg or clarified butter; sprinkle over bread crumbs with which have been mixed salt, mace,
cayenne, and lemon-peel in the above proportion. Fry a light brown, and serve with or without
gravy, as may be preferred.

Seasonable at any time.

    VARIOUS MODES OF FATTENING FOWLS.--It would, I think, be a
    difficult matter to find, among the entire fraternity of
    fowl-keepers, a dozen whose mode of fattening "stock" is the
    same. Some say that the grand f secret is to give them abundance
    of saccharine food; others say nothing beats heavy corn steeped
    in milk; while another breeder, celebrated in his day, and the
    recipient of a gold medal from a learned society, says, "The
    best method is as follows:-The chickens are to be taken from the
    hen the night after they are hatched, and fed with eggs
    hard-boiled, chopped, and mixed with crumbs of bread, as larks
    and other small birds are fed, for the first fortnight; after
    which give them oatmeal and treacle mixed so as to crumble, of
    which the chickens are very fond, and thrive so fast that, at
    the end of two months, they will be as large as full-grown
    fowls." Others there are who insist that nothing beats
    oleaginous diet, and cram their birds with ground oats and suet.
    But, whatever the course of diet favoured, on one point they
    seem agreed; and that is, that, while fattening, the fowls
    should be kept in the dark. Supposing the reader to be a
    dealer--a breeder of gross chicken meat for the market (against
    which supposition the chances are 10,000 to 1), and beset with
    as few scruples as generally trouble the huckster, the advice is
    valuable. "Laugh and grow fat" is a good maxim enough; but
    "Sleep and grow fat" is, as is well known to folks of porcine
    attributes, a better. The poor birds, immured in their dark
    dungeons, ignorant that there is life and sunshine abroad, tuck
    their heads under their wings and make a long night of it; while
    their digestive organs, having no harder work than to pile up
    fat, have an easy time enough. But, unless we are mistaken, he
    who breeds poultry for his own eating, bargains for a more
    substantial reward than the questionable pleasure of burying his
    carving-knife in chicken grease. Tender, delicate, and
    nutritious flesh is the great aim; and these qualities, I can
    affirm without fear of contradiction, were never attained by a
    dungeon-fatted chicken: perpetual gloom and darkness is as
    incompatible with chicken life as it is with human. If you wish
    to be convinced of the absurdity of endeavouring to thwart
    nature's laws, plant a tuft of grass, or a cabbage-plant, in the
    darkest corner of your coal-cellar. The plant or the tuft may
    increase in length and breadth, but its colour will be as wan
    and pale, almost, as would be your own face under the
    circumstances.

POULET A LA MARENGO.

949. INGREDIENTS.--1 large fowl, 4 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1
pint of stock No. 105, or water, about 20 mushroom-buttons, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful
of powdered sugar, a very small piece of garlic.

Mode.--Cut the fowl into 8 or 10 pieces; put them with the oil into a stewpan, and brown them
over a moderate fire; dredge in the above proportion of flour; when that is browned, pour in
the stock or water; let it simmer very slowly for rather more than 1/2 hour, and skim off the
fat as it rises to the top; add the mushrooms; season with salt, pepper, garlic, and sugar;
take out the fowl, which arrange pyramidically on the dish, with the inferior joints at the
bottom. Reduce the sauce by boiling it quickly over the fire, keeping it stirred until sufficiently
thick to adhere to the back of a spoon; pour over the fowl, and serve.

Time.--Altogether 50 minutes. Average cost, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    A FOWL À LA MARENGO.--The following is the origin of the
    well-known dish Poulet à la Marengo:--On the evening of the
    battle the first consul was very hungry after the agitation of
    the day, and a fowl was ordered with all expedition. The fowl
    was procured, but there was no butter at hand, and unluckily
    none could be found in the neighbourhood. There was oil in
    abundance, however; and the cook having poured a certain
    quantity into his skillet, put in the fowl, with a clove of
    garlic and other seasoning, with a little white wine, the best
    the country afforded; he then garnished it with mushrooms, and
    served it up hot. This dish proved the second conquest of the
    day, as the first consul found it most agreeable to his palate,
    and expressed his satisfaction. Ever since, a fowl à la Marengo
    is a favourite dish with all lovers of good cheer.

MINCED FOWL A LA BECHAMEL.

950. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 6 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel sauce No. 367,
6 tablespoonfuls of white stock No. 107, the white of 1 egg, bread crumbs, clarified butter.

Mode.--Take the remains of roast fowls, mince the white meat very small, and put it into a
stewpan with the Béchamel and stock; stir it well over the fire, and just let it boil up. Pour
the mince into a dish, beat up the white of egg, spread it over, and strew on it a few grated
bread crumbs; pour a very little clarified butter on the whole, and brown either before the
fire or with a salamander. This should be served in a silver dish, if at hand.

Time.--2 or 3 minutes to simmer in the sauce.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE BEST WAY TO FATTEN FOWLS.--The barn-door fowl is in itself a
    complete refutation of the cramming and dungeon policy of
    feeding practised by some. This fowl, which has the common run
    of the farm-yard, living on dairy-scraps and offal from the
    stable, begins to grow fat at threshing-time. He has his fill of
    the finest corn; he has his fill of fresh air and natural
    exercise, and at last he comes smoking to the table,--a dish
    for the gods. In the matter of unnaturally stuffing and
    confining fowls, Mowbray is exactly of our opinion. He says:
    "The London chicken-butchers, as they are termed, are said to
    be, of all others, the most expeditious and dexterous feeders,
    putting up a coop of fowls, and making them thoroughly fat
    within the space of a fortnight, using much grease, and that
    perhaps not of the most delicate kind, in the food. In this way
    I have no boasts to make, having always found it necessary to
    allow a considerable number of weeks for the purpose of making
    fowls fat in coops. In the common way this business is often
    badly managed, fowls being huddled together in a small coop,
    tearing each other to pieces, instead of enjoying that repose
    which alone can insure, the wished-for object--irregularly fed
    and cleaned, until they become so stenched and poisoned in their
    own excrement, that their flesh actually smells and tastes when
    smoking upon the table." Sussex produces the fattest and largest
    poultry of any county in England, and the fatting process there
    most common is to give them a gruel made of pot-liquor and
    bruised oats, with which are mixed hog's grease, sugar, and
    milk. The fowls are kept very warm, and crammed morning and
    night. They are put into the coop, and kept there two or three
    days before the cramming begins, and then it is continued for a
    fortnight, and the birds are sent to market.

RAGOUT OF FOWL.

951. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, 3 shalots, 2 blades of mace, a faggot of
savoury herbs, 2 or three slices of lean ham, 1 pint of stock or water, pepper and salt to
taste, 1 onion, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 teaspoonful
of pounded sugar, 1 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Cut the fowls up into neat pieces, the same as for a fricassee; put the trimmings into
a stewpan with the shalots, mace, herbs, ham, onion, and stock (water may be substituted for
this). Boil it slowly for 1 hour, strain the liquor, and put a small piece of butter into a
stewpan; when melted, dredge in sufficient flour to dry up the butter, and stir it over the
fire. Put in the strained liquor, boil for a few minutes, and strain it again over the pieces
of fowl. Squeeze in the lemon-juice, add the sugar and a seasoning of pepper and salt, make
it hot, but do not allow it to boil; lay the fowl neatly on the dish, and garnish with croûtons.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE BEST FOWLS TO FATTEN, &c.--The chicks most likely to fatten
    well are those first hatched in the brood, and those with the
    shortest legs. Long-legged fowls, as a rule, are by far the most
    difficult to fatten. The most delicate sort are those which are
    put up to fatten as soon as the hen forsakes them; for, as says
    an old writer, "then they will be in fine condition, and full of
    flesh, which flesh is afterwards expended in the exercise of
    foraging for food, and in the increase of stature; and it may be
    a work of some weeks to recover it,--especially with young
    cocks." But whether you take them in hand as chicks, or not till
    they are older, the three prime rules to be observed are, sound
    and various food, warmth, and cleanliness. There is nothing that
    a fatting fowl grows so fastidious about as his water. If water
    any way foul be offered him, he will not drink it, but sulk with
    his food, and pine, and you all the while wondering the reason
    why. Keep them separate, allowing to each bird as much space as
    you can spare. Spread the ground with sharp sandy gravel; take
    care that they are not disturbed. In addition to their regular
    diet of good corn, make them a cake of ground oats or beans,
    brown sugar, milk, and mutton suet. Let the cake lie till it is
    stale, then crumble it, and give each bird a gill-measureful
    morning and evening. No entire grain should be given to fowls
    during the time they are fattening; indeed, the secret of
    success lies in supplying them with the most nutritious food
    without stint, and in such a form that their digestive mills
    shall find no difficulty in grinding it.

ROAST FOWLS.

952. INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls; a little flour.

Mode.--Fowls to be tender should be killed a couple of days before they are dressed; when the
feathers come out easily, then let them be picked and cooked. In drawing them, be careful not
to break the gall-bag, as, wherever it touches, it would impart a very bitter taste; the liver
and gizzard should also be preserved. Truss them in the following manner:--After having carefully
picked them, cut off the head, and skewer the skin of the neck down over the back. Cut off
the claws; dip the legs in boiling water, and scrape them; turn the pinions under, run a skewer
through them and the middle of the legs, which should be passed through the body to the pinion
and leg on the other side, one skewer securing the limbs on both sides. The liver and gizzard
should be placed in the wings, the liver on one side and the gizzard on the other. Tie the
legs together by passing a trussing-needle, threaded with twine, through the backbone, and
secure it on the other side. If trussed like a capon, the legs are placed more apart. When
firmly trussed, singe them all over; put them down to a bright clear fire, paper the breasts
with a sheet of buttered paper, and keep the fowls well basted. Roast them for 3/4 hour, more
or less, according to the size, and 10 minutes before serving, remove the paper, dredge the
fowls with a little fine flour, put a piece of butter into the basting-ladle, and as it melts,
baste the fowls with it; when nicely frothed and of a rich colour, serve with good brown gravy,
a little of which should be poured over the fowls, and a tureen of well-made bread sauce, No.
371. Mushroom, oyster, or egg sauce are very suitable accompaniments to roast fowl.--Chicken
is roasted in the same manner.

Time.--A very large fowl, quite 1 hour, medium-sized one 3/4 hour, chicken 1/2 hour, or rather
longer.

Average cost, in full season, 5s. a pair; when scarce, 7s.

    THE DISEASES OF FOWLS, AND HOW TO CURE THEM.--The diseases to
    which Gallus domesticus is chiefly liable, are roup, pip,
    scouring, and chip. The first-mentioned is the most common of
    all, and results from cold. The ordinary symptoms,--swollen
    eyes, running at the nostrils, and the purple colour of the
    wattles. Part birds so affected from the healthy ones, as, when
    the disease is at its height it is as contagious as glanders
    among horses. Wash out the nostrils with warm water, give daily
    a peppercorn inclosed in dough; bathe the eyes and nostrils with
    warm milk and water. If the head is much swollen, bathe with
    warm brandy and water. When the bird is getting well, put half a
    spoonful of sulphur in his drinking-water. Some fanciers
    prescribe for this disease half a spoonful of table salt,
    dissolved in half a gill of water, in which rue has been
    steeped; others, pills composed of ground rice and fresh butter:
    but the remedy first mentioned will be found far the best. As
    there is a doubt respecting the wholesomeness of the eggs laid
    by roupy hens, it will be as well to throw them away. The pip is
    a white horny skin growing on the tip of the bird's tongue. It
    should be removed with the point of a penknife, and the place
    rubbed with salt.

FOWL AND RICE CROQUETTES (an Entree).

953. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of rice, 1 quart of stock or broth, 3 oz. of butter, minced fowl,
egg, and bread crumbs.

Mode.--Put the rice into the above proportion of cold stock or broth, and let it boil very
gently for 1/2 hour; then add the butter, and simmer it till quite dry and soft When cold,
make it into balls, hollow out the inside, and fill with minced fowl made by recipe No. 956.
The mince should be rather thick. Cover over with rice, dip the balls into egg, sprinkle them
with bread crumbs, and fry a nice brown. Dish them, and garnish with fried parsley. Oysters,
white sauce, or a little cream, may be stirred into the rice before it cools.

Time.--1/2 hour to boil the rice, 10 minutes to fry the croquettes.

Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.

Seasonable at any time.

    CHIP.--If the birds are allowed to puddle about on wet soil, or
    to be much out in the rain, they will get "chip." Young chicks
    are especially liable to this complaint. They will sit shivering
    in out-of-the-way corners, perpetually uttering a dolorous
    "chip, chip;" seemingly frozen with cold, though, on handling
    them, they are found to be in high fever. A wholesale breeder
    would take no pains to attempt the cure of fowls so afflicted;
    but they who keep chickens for the pleasure, and not for the
    profit they yield, will be inclined to recover them if possible.
    Give them none but warm food, half a peppercorn rolled in a
    morsel of dough every night, and a little nitre in their water.
    Above all, keep them warm; a corner in the kitchen fender, for a
    day or two, will do more to effect a cure than the run of a
    druggist's warehouse.

CROQUETTES OF FOWL (an Entree).

954. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 shalots, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, white sauce; pepper,
salt, and pounded mace to taste; 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, the remains of cold roast
fowls, the yolks of 2 eggs, egg, and bread crumbs.

Mode.--Mince the fowl, carefully removing all skin and bone, and fry the shalots in the butter;
add the minced fowl, dredge in the flour, put in the pepper, salt, mace, pounded sugar, and
sufficient white sauce to moisten it; stir to it the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs, and set it
by to cool. Then make the mixture up into balls, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry a nice brown.
They may be served on a border of mashed potatoes, with gravy or sauce in the centre.

Time.--10 minutes to fry the balls.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE TURN.--What is termed "turrling" with song-birds, is known,
    as regard fowls, as the "turn." Its origin is the same in both
    cases,--over-feeing and want of exercise. Without a moment's
    warning, a fowl so afflicted will totter and fall from its
    perch, and unless assistance be at hand, speedily give up the
    ghost. The veins of the palate should be opened, and a few drops
    of mixture composed of six parts of sweet nitre and one of
    ammonia, poured down its throat. I have seen ignorant keepers
    plunge a bird, stricken with the "turn," into cold water; but I
    never saw it taken out again alive; and for a good reason: the
    sudden chill has the effect of driving the blood to the
    head,--of aggravating the disease indeed, instead of relieving
    it.

HASHED FOWL--an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery).

955.

Mode.--Cut off the best joints from the fowl, and the remainder make into gravy, by adding
to the bones and trimmings a pint of water, an onion sliced and fried of a nice brown, the
carrots, mace, seasoning, and herbs. Let these stew gently for 1-1/2 hour, strain the liquor,
and thicken with a little flour and butter. Lay in the fowl, thoroughly warm it through, add
the ketchup, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.

Seasonable at any time.

    SKIN-DISEASE IN FOWLS.--Skin-disease is, nine times out of ten,
    caused by the feathers being swarmed by parasites. Poor feeding
    will induce this, even if cleanliness be observed;
    uncleanliness, however liberal the bill of fare, will be taken
    as an invitation by the little biting pests, and heartily
    responded to. Mix half a teaspoonful of hydro-oxalic acid with
    twelve teaspoonfuls of water,--apply to the itching parts with
    an old shaving-brush.

    OBSTRUCTION OF THE CROP.--Obstruction of the crop is occasioned
    by weakness or greediness. You may know when a bird is so
    afflicted by his crop being distended almost to bursting.
    Mowbray tells of a hen of his in this predicament; when the crop
    was opened, a quantity of new beans were discovered in a state
    of vegetation. The crop should be slit from the bottom to the
    top with a sharp pair of scissors, the contents taken out, and
    the slit sewed up again with line white thread.

MINCED FOWL--an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery).

956. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 2 hard-boiled eggs, salt, cayenne, and pounded
mace, 1 onion, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 oz. of butter, two teaspoonfuls
of flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Cut out from the fowl all the white meat, and mince it finely without any skin or bone;
put the bones, skin, and trimmings into a stewpan with an onion, a bunch of savoury herbs,
a blade of mace, and nearly a pint of water; let this stew for an hour, then strain the liquor.
Chop the eggs small; mix them with the fowl; add salt, cayenne, and pounded mace, put in the
gravy and remaining ingredients; let the whole just boil, and serve with sippets of toasted bread.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Another way to make this is to mince the fowl, and warm it in white sauce or Béchamel.
When dressed like this, 3 or 4 poached eggs may be placed on the top: oysters, or chopped mushrooms,
or balls of oyster forcemeat, may be laid round the dish.

    THE MOULTING SEASON.--During the moulting season beginning
    properly at the end of September, the fowls will require a
    little extra attention. Keep them dry and warm, and feed them
    liberally on warm and satisfying food. If in any fowl the moult
    should seem protracted, examine it for broken feather-stumps
    still beaded in the skin: if you find any, extract them
    carefully with a pair of tweezers. If a fowl is hearty and
    strong, six weeks will see him out of his trouble; if he is
    weakly, or should take cold during the time, he will not
    thoroughly recover in less than three months. It is seldom or
    ever that hens will lay during the moult; while the cock, during
    the same period, will give so little of his consideration to the
    frivolities of love, that you may as well, nay, much better,
    keep him by himself till he perfectly recovers. A moulting
    chicken makes but a sorry dish.

HASHED FOWL, Indian Fashion (an Entree).

957.--INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 3 or 4 sliced onions, 1 apple, 2 oz. of
butter, pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 2 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 pint of gravy.

Mode.--Cut the onions into slices, mince the apple, and fry these in the butter; add pounded
mace, pepper, salt, curry-powder, vinegar, flour, and sugar in the above proportions; when
the onion is brown, put it the gravy, which should be previously made from the bones and trimmings
of the fowls, and stew for 3/4 hour; add the fowl cut into nice-sized joints, let it warm through,
and when quite tender, serve. The dish should be garnished with au edging of boiled rice.

    THE SCOUR OR DYSENTERY.--The scour, or dysentery, or diarrhoea,
    is induced variously. A sudden alteration in diet will cause it,
    as will a superabundance of green food. The best remedy is a
    piece of toasted biscuit sopped in ale. If the disease has too
    tight a hold on the bird to be quelled by this, give six drops
    of syrup of white poppies and six drops of castor-oil, mixed
    with a little oatmeal or ground rice. Restrict the bird's diet,
    for a few days, to dry food,--crushed beans or oats, stale
    bread-crumbs, &c.

    FOWL SCOLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery).

    958. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled fowl, 1/2
    pint of Béchamel, No. 367, or white sauce, No. 537 or 539.

    Mode.--Strip off the skin from the fowl; cut the meat into
    thin slices, and warm them in about 1/2 pint, or rather more, of
    Béchamel, or white sauce. When quite hot, serve, and garnish the
    dish with rolled ham or bacon toasted.

    Time.--1 minute to simmer the slices of fowl.

    Seasonable at any time.

    THE FEATHER LEGGED BANTAM.--Since the introduction of the Bantam
    into Europe, it has ramified into many varieties, none of which
    are destitute of elegance, and some, indeed, remarkable for
    their beauty. All are, or ought to be, of small size, but lively
    and vigorous, exhibiting in their movements both grace and
    stateliness. The variety shown in the engraving is remarkable
    for the tarsi, or beams of the legs, being plumed to the toes,
    with stiff, long feathers, which brush the ground. Owing,
    possibly, to the little care taken to preserve this variety from
    admixture, it is now not frequently seen. Another variety is
    often red, with a black breast and single dentated comb. The
    tarsi are smooth, and of a dusky blue. When this sort of
    Bantam is pure, it yields in courage and spirit to none, and is,
    in fact, a game-fowl in miniature, being as beautiful and
    graceful as it is spirited. A pure white Bantam, possessing all
    the qualifications just named, is also bred in the royal aviary
    at Windsor.

AN INDIAN DISH OF FOWL (an Entree).

959.

Mode.--Divide the fowl into joints; slice and fry the onions in a little butter, taking care
not to burn them; sprinkle over the fowl a little curry-powder and salt; fry these nicely,
pile them high in the centre of the dish, cover with the onion, and serve with a cut lemon
on a plate. Care must be taken that the onions are not greasy: they should be quite dry, but
not burnt.

Time.--5 minutes to fry the onions, 10 minutes to fry the fowl.

Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 4d.

Seasonable during the winter month.

    THE SPECKLED HAMBURG.--Of the speckled, or spangled Hamburg
    which is a favourite breed with many persons, there are two
    varieties,--the golden-speckled and the silver-speckled. The
    general colour of the former is golden, or orange-yellow, each
    feather having a glossy dark brown or black tip, particularly
    remarkable on the hackles of the cock and the wing-coverts, and
    also on the darker feathers of the breast. The female is yellow,
    or orange-brown, the feathers in like manner being margined with
    black. The silver-speckled variety is distinguished by the
    ground-colour of the plumage being of a silver-white, with
    perhaps a tinge of straw-yellow, every leather being margined
    with a semi-lunar mark of glossy black. Both of these varieties
    are extremely beautiful, the hens laying freely. First-rate
    birds command a high price.

FOWL SAUTE WITH PEAS (an Entree).

960. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 2 oz. of butter, pepper, salt, and pounded
mace to taste, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of weak stock, 1 pint of green peas, 1
teaspoonful of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Cut the fowl into nice pieces; put the butter into a stew-pan; sautez or fry the fowl
a nice brown colour, previously sprinkling it with pepper, salt, and pounded mace. Dredge in
the flour, shake the ingredients well round, then add the stock and peas, and stew till the
latter are tender, which will be in about 20 minutes; put in the pounded sugar, and serve,
placing the chicken round, and the peas in the middle of the dish. When liked, mushrooms may
be substituted for the peas.

Time.--Altogether 40 minutes.

Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 7d.

Seasonable from June to August.

BOUDIN A LA REINE (an Entree).

(M. Ude's Recipe.)

961. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, 1 pint of Béchamel No. 367, salt and cayenne
to taste, egg and bread crumbs.

Mode.--Take the breasts and nice white meat from the fowls; cut it into small dice of an equal
size, and throw them into some good Béchamel, made by recipe No. 367; season with salt and
cayenne, and put the mixture into a dish to cool. When this preparation is quite cold, cut
it into 2 equal parts, which should be made into boudins of a long shape, the size of the dish
they are intended to be served on; roll them in flour, egg and bread-crumb them, and be careful
that the ends are well covered with the crumbs, otherwise they would break in the frying-pan;
fry them a nice colour, put them before the fire to drain the greasy moisture from them, and
serve with the remainder of the Béchamel poured round: this should be thinned with a little stock.

Time.--10 minutes to fry the boudins.

Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient for 1 entrée.

    SIR JOHN SEBRIGHT'S BANTAMS.--Above all Bantams is placed, the
    celebrated and beautiful breed called Sir John Sebright's Silver
    Bantams. This breed, which Sir John brought to perfection after
    years of careful trials, is very small, with un-feathered legs,
    and a rose comb and short hackles. The plumage is gold or
    silver, spangled, every feather being of a golden orange, or of
    a silver white, with a glossy jet-black margin; the cocks have
    the tail folded like that of a hen, with the sickle feathers
    shortened straight, or nearly so, and broader than usual. The
    term hen-cocks is, in consequence, often applied to them; but
    although the sickle feathers are thus modified, no bird
    possesses higher courage, or a more gallant carriage. The
    attitude of the cock is, indeed, singularly proud; and he is
    often seen to bear himself so haughtily, that his head, thrown
    back as if in disdain, nearly touches the two upper
    feathers--sickles they can scarcely be called--of his tail.
    Half-bred birds of this kind are not uncommon, but birds of the
    pure breed are not to be obtained without trouble and expense;
    indeed, some time ago, it was almost impossible to procure
    either a fowl or an egg. "The finest," says the writer whom we
    have consulted as to this breed, "we have ever seen, were in Sir
    John's poultry-yard, adjacent to Turnham-Green Common, in the
    byroad leading to Acton."

FOWL A LA MAYONNAISE.

962. INGREDIENTS.--A cold roast fowl, Mayonnaise sauce No. 468, 4 or 5 young lettuces, 4 hard-boiled
eggs, a few water-cresses, endive.

Mode.--Cut the fowl into neat joints, lay them in a deep dish, piling them high in the centre,
sauce the fowl with Mayonnaise made by recipe No. 468, and garnish the dish with young lettuces
cut in halves, water-cresses, endive, and hard-boiled eggs: these may be sliced in rings, or
laid on the dish whole, cutting off at the bottom a piece of the white, to make the egg stand.
All kinds of cold meat and solid fish may be dressed à la Mayonnaise, and make excellent luncheon
or supper dishes. The sauce should not be poured over the fowls until the moment of serving.
Should a very large Mayonnaise be required, use 2 fowls instead of 1, with an equal proportion
of the remaining ingredients.

Average cost, with one fowl, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient for a moderate-sized dish.

Seasonable from April to September.

    BLACK SPANISH.--The real Spanish fowl is recognized by its
    uniformly black colour burnished with tints of green; its
    peculiar white face, and the large development of its comb and
    wattle. The hens are excellent layers, and their eggs are of a
    very large size. They are, however, bad nurses; consequently,
    their eggs should be laid in the nest of other varieties to be
    hatched. "In purchasing Spanish," says an authority, "blue legs,
    the entire absence of white or coloured feathers in the plumage,
    and a large, white face, with a very large high comb, which
    should be erect in the cock, though pendent in the hens, should
    be insisted on." The flesh of this fowl is esteemed; but, from
    the smallness of its body when compared with that of the
    Dorking, it is not placed on an equality with it for the table.
    Otherwise, however, they are profitable birds, and their
    handsome carriage, and striking contrast of colour in the comb,
    face, and plumage, are a high recommendation to them as kept
    fowls. For a town fowl, they are perhaps better adapted than any
    other variety.

FOWL PILLAU, based on M. Soyer's Recipe (an Indian Dish).

963. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of rice, 2 oz. of butter, a fowl, 2 quarts of stock or good broth,
40 cardamum-seeds, 1/2 oz. of coriander-seed, 1/4 oz. of cloves, 1/4 oz. of allspice, 1/4 oz.
of mace, 1/4 oz. of cinnamon, 1/2 oz. of peppercorns, 4 onions, 6 thin slices of bacon, 2 hard-boiled
eggs.

Mode.--Well wash 1 lb. of the best Patna rice, put it into a frying-pan with the butter, which
keep moving over a slow fire until the rice is lightly browned. Truss the fowl as for boiling,
put it into a stewpan with the stock or broth; pound the spices and seeds thoroughly in a mortar,
tie them in a piece of muslin, and put them in with the fowl. Let it boil slowly until it is
nearly done; then add the rice, which should stew until quite tender and almost dry; cut the
onions into slices, sprinkle them with flour, and fry, without breaking them, of a nice brown
colour. Have ready the slices of bacon curled and grilled, and the eggs boiled hard. Lay the
fowl in the form of a pyramid upon a dish, smother with the rice, garnish with the bacon, fried
onions, and the hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, and serve very hot. Before taking the rice
out, remove the spices.

Time.--1/2 hour to stew the fowl without the rice; 1/2 hour with it.

Average cost, 4s. 3d. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE SERAI TA-OOK, OR FOWLS OF THE SULTAN.--This fowl is the size
    of our English Polands, and is the latest species introduced to
    England. They have a white and flowing plumage, a full-sized,
    compact Poland tuft on the head, are muffed, have a full flowing
    tail, short legs well feathered, and five toes upon each foot.
    Their comb consists merely of two little points, and their
    wattles are very small: their colour is that of a pure white. In
    January, 1854, they arrived in this country from Constantinople;
    and they take their name from sarai, the Turkish word for
    sultan's palace, and ta-ook, the Turkish for fowl. They are
    thus called the "fowls of the sultan," a name which has the
    twofold advantage of being the nearest to be found to that by
    which they have been known in their own country, and of
    designating the country whence they come. Their habits are
    described as being generally brisk and happy-tempered, but not
    so easily kept in as Cochin-Chinas. They are excellent layers;
    but they are non-sitters and small eaters: their eggs are large
    and white. Brahmas or Cochins will clear the crop of a grass-run
    long before they will, and, with scattered food, they soon
    satisfy themselves and walk away.

POULET AUX CRESSONS.

964. INGREDIENTS.--A fowl, a large bunch of water-cresses, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1/4
pint of gravy.

Mode.--Truss and roast a fowl by recipe No. 952, taking care that it is nicely frothed and
brown. Wash and dry the water-cresses, pick them nicely, and arrange them in a flat layer on
a dish. Sprinkle over a little salt and the above proportion of vinegar; place over these the
fowl, and pour over it the gravy. A little gravy should be served in a tureen. When not liked,
the vinegar may be omitted.

ROAST FOWL, Stuffed.

965. INGREDIENTS.--A large fowl, forcemeat No. 417, a little flour.

Mode.--Select a large plump fowl, fill the breast with forcemeat, made by recipe No. 417, truss
it firmly, the same as for a plain roast fowl, dredge it with flour, and put it down to a bright
fire. Roast it for nearly or quite an hour, should it be very large; remove the skewers, and
serve with a good brown gravy and a tureen of bread sauce.

Note.--Sausage-meat stuffing may be substituted for the above: this is now a very general mode
of serving fowl.

    PENCILLED HAMBURG.--This variety of the Hamburg fowl is of two
    colours, golden and silver, and is very minutely marked. The
    hens of both should have the body clearly pencilled across with
    several bars of black, and the hackle in both, sexes should be
    perfectly free from dark marks. The cocks do not exhibit the
    pencillings, but are white or brown in the golden or silver
    birds respectively. Their form is compact, and their attitudes
    graceful and sprightly. The hens do not sit, but lay extremely
    well; hence one of their common names, that of Dutch every-day
    layers. They are also known in different parts of the country,
    as Chitteprats, Creoles, or Corals, Bolton bays and grays, and,
    in some parts of Yorkshire, by the wrong name of Corsican fowls.
    They are imported in large numbers from Holland, but those bred
    in this country are greatly superior in size.

GIBLET PIE.

966. INGREDIENTS.--A set of duck or goose giblets, 1 lb. of rump-steak, 1 onion, 1/2 teaspoonful
of whole black pepper, a bunch of savoury herbs, plain crust.

Mode.--Clean, and put the giblets into a stewpan with an onion, whole pepper, and a bunch of
savoury herbs; add rather more than a pint of water, and simmer gently for about 1-1/2 hour.
Take them out, let them cool, and cut them into pieces; line the bottom of a pie-dish with
a few pieces of rump-steak; add a layer of giblets and a few more pieces of steak; season with
pepper and salt, and pour in the gravy (which should be strained), that the giblets were stewed
in; cover with a plain crust, and bake for rather more than 1-1/2 hour in a brisk oven. Cover
a piece of paper over the pie, to prevent the crust taking too much colour.

Time.--1-1/2 hour to stew the giblets, about 1 hour to bake the pie.

Average cost, exclusive of the giblets, 1s. 4d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

    THE BRENT GOOSE.--This is the smallest and most numerous species
    of the geese which visit the British islands. It makes its
    appearance in winter, and ranges over the whole of the coasts
    and estuaries frequented by other migrant geese. Mr. Selby
    states that a very large body of these birds annually resort to
    the extensive sandy and muddy flats which lie between the
    mainland and Holy Island, on the Northumbrian coast, and which
    are covered by every flow of the tide. This part of the coast
    appears to have been a favourite resort of these birds from time
    immemorial, where they have always received the name of Ware
    geese, no doubt from their continually feeding on marine
    vegetables. Their flesh is very agreeable.

HASHED GOOSE.

967. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast goose, 2 onions, 2 oz. of butter, 1 pint of boiling
water, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of port wine,
2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.

Mode.--Cut up the goose into pieces of the size required; the inferior joints, trimmings, &c.,
put into a stewpan to make the gravy; slice and fry the onions in the butter of a very pale
brown; add these to the trimmings, and pour over about a pint of boiling water; stew these
gently for 3/4 hour, then skim and strain the liquor. Thicken it with flour, and flavour with
port wine and ketchup, in the above proportion; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and put
in the pieces of goose; let these get thoroughly hot through, but do not allow them to boil,
and serve with sippets of toasted bread.

Time.--Altogether, rather more than 1 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold goose, 4d.

Seasonable from September to March.

    THE WILD GOOSE.--This bird is sometimes called the "Gray-lag"
    and is the original of the domestic goose. It is, according to
    Pennant, the only species which the Britons could take young,
    and familiarize. "The Gray-lag," says Mr. Gould, "is known to
    Persia, and we believe it is generally dispersed over Asia
    Minor." It is the bird that saved the Capitol by its vigilance,
    and by the Romans was cherished accordingly.

ROAST GOOSE.

968.

Choosing and Trussing.--Select a goose with a clean white skin, plump breast, and yellow feet:
if these latter are red, the bird is old. Should the weather permit, let it hang for a few
days: by so doing, the flavour will be very much improved. Pluck, singe, draw, and carefully
wash and wipe the goose; cut off the neck close to the back, leaving the skin long enough to
turn over; cut off the feet at the first joint, and separate the pinions at the first joint.
Beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling-pin, put a skewer through the under part of each wing,
and having drawn up the legs closely, put a skewer into the middle of each, and pass the same
quite through the body. Insert another skewer into the small of the leg, bring it close down
to the side bone, run it through, and do the same to the other side. Now cut off the end of
the vent, and make a hole in the skin sufficiently large for the passage of the rump, in order
to keep in the seasoning.

Mode.--Make a sage-and-onion stuffing of the above ingredients, by recipe No. 504; put it into
the body of the goose, and secure it firmly at both ends, by passing the rump through the hole
made in the skin, and the other end by tying the skin of the neck to the back; by this means
the seasoning will not escape. Put it down to a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and roast
from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, according to the size. Remove the skewers, and serve with a tureen of
good gravy, and one of well-made apple-sauce. Should a very highly-flavoured seasoning be preferred,
the onions should not be parboiled, but minced raw: of the two methods, the mild seasoning
is far superior. A ragoût, or pie, should be made of the giblets, or they may be stewed down
to make gravy. Be careful to serve the goose before the breast falls, or its appearance will
be spoiled by coming flattened to table. As this is rather a troublesome joint to carve, a
large quantity of gravy should not be poured round the goose, but sent in a tureen.

Time.--A large goose, 1-3/4 hour; a moderate-sized one, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable from September to March; but in perfection from Michaelmas to Christmas.

Average cost, 5s. 6d. each. Sufficient for 8 or 9 persons.

Note.--A teaspoonful of made mustard, a saltspoonful of salt, a few grains of cayenne, mixed
with a glass of port wine, are sometimes poured into the goose by a slit made in the apron.
This sauce is, by many persons, considered an improvement.

    THE GOOSE.--This bird is pretty generally distributed over the
    face of the globe, being met with in North America, Lapland,
    Iceland, Arabia, and Persia. Its varieties are numerous; but in
    England there is only one species, which is supposed to be a
    native breed. The best geese are found on the borders of
    Suffolk, and in Norfolk and Berkshire; but the largest flocks
    are reared in the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridge. They
    thrive best where they have an easy access to water, and large
    herds of them are sent every year to London, to be fattened by
    the metropolitan poulterers. "A Michaelmas goose," says Dr.
    Kitchener, "is as famous in the mouths of the million as the
    minced-pie at Christmas; yet for those who eat with delicacy, it
    is, at that time, too full-grown. The true period when the goose
    is in the highest perfection is when it has just acquired its
    full growth, and not begun to harden; if the March goose is
    insipid, the Michaelmas goose is rank. The fine time is between
    both; from the second week in June to the first in September."
    It is said that the Michaelmas goose is indebted to Queen
    Elizabeth for its origin on the table at that season. Her
    majesty happened to dine on one at the table of an English
    baronet, when she received the news of the discomfiture of the
    Spanish Armada. In commemoration of this event, she commanded
    the goose to make its appearance at table on every Michaelmas.
    We here give an engraving of the Emden goose.

TO DRESS A GREEN GOOSE.

969. INGREDIENTS.--Goose, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Geese are called green till they are about four months old, and should not be stuffed.
After it has been singed and trussed, the same as in the preceding recipe, put into the body
a seasoning of pepper and salt, and the butter to moisten it inside. Roast before a clear fire
for about 3/4 hour, froth and brown it nicely, and serve with a brown gravy, and, when liked,
gooseberry-sauce. This dish should be garnished with water-cresses.

Time.--About 3/4 hour. Average cost, 4s. 6d. each.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable in June, July, and August.

    THE EGYPTIAN GOOSE.--Especial attention has been directed to
    this bird by Herodotus, who says it was held sacred by the
    ancient Egyptians, which has been partially confirmed by modern
    travellers. Mr. Salt remarks, "Horus Apollo says the old geese
    stay with their young in the most imminent danger, at the risk
    of their own lives, which I have myself frequently witnessed.
    Vielpanser is the goose of the Nile, and wherever this goose is
    represented on the walls of the temples in colours, the
    resemblance may be clearly traced." The goose is also said to
    have been a bird under the care of Isis. It has been placed by
    Mr. Gould amongst the birds of Europe; not from the number of
    half-reclaimed individuals which are annually shot in Britain,
    but from the circumstance of its occasionally visiting the
    southern parts of the continent from its native country, Africa.
    The Toulouse goose, of which we give an engraving, is a
    well-known bird.

ROAST GUINEA-FOWL, Larded.

970. INGREDIENTS.--A Guinea-fowl, lardoons, flour, and salt.

Mode.--When this bird is larded, it should be trussed the same as a pheasant; if plainly roasted,
truss it like a turkey. After larding and trussing it, put it down to roast at a brisk fire;
keep it well basted, and a short time before serving, dredge it with a little flour, and let
it froth nicely. Serve with a little gravy in the dish, and a tureen of the same, and one of
well-made bread-sauce.

Time.--Guinea-fowl, larded, 1-1/4 hour; plainly roasted, about 1 hour.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable in winter.

Note.--The breast, if larded, should be covered with a piece of paper, and removed about 10
minutes before serving.

    THE GUINEA-FOWL.--The bird takes its name from Guinea, in
    Africa, where it is found--wild, and in great abundance. It is
    gregarious in its habits, associating in flocks of two or three
    hundred, delighting in marshy grounds, and at night perching
    upon trees, or on high situations. Its size is about the same as
    that of a common hen, but it stands higher on its legs. Though
    domesticated, it retains much of its wild nature, and is apt to
    wander. The hens lay abundantly, and the eggs are excellent. In
    their flesh, however, they are not so white as the common fowl,
    but more inclined to the colour of the pheasant, for which it
    frequently makes a good substitute at table. The flesh is both
    savoury and easy of digestion, and is in season when game is out
    of season.

LARK PIE (an Entree).

971.

Mode.--Make a stuffing of bread crumbs, minced lemon-peel, parsley, and the yolk of an egg,
all of which should be well mixed together; roll the larks in flour, and stuff them. Line the
bottom of a pie-dish with a few slices of beef and bacon; over these place the larks, and season
with salt, pepper, minced parsley, and chopped shalot, in the above proportion. Pour in the
stock or water, cover with crust, and bake for an hour in a moderate oven. During the time
the pie is baking, shake it 2 or 3 times, to assist in thickening the gravy, and serve very hot.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost, 1s. 6d. a dozen.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable.--In full season in November.

ROAST LARKS.

972. INGREDIENTS.--Larks, egg and bread crumbs, fresh butter.

Mode.--These birds are by many persons esteemed a great delicacy, and may be either roasted
or broiled. Pick, gut, and clean them; when they are trussed, brush them over with the yolk
of an egg; sprinkle with bread crumbs, and roast them before a quick fire; baste them continually
with fresh butter, and keep sprinkling with the bread crumbs until the birds are well covered.
Dish them on bread crumbs fried in clarified butter, and garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
Broiled larks are also very excellent: they should be cooked over a clear fire, and would take
about 10 minutes or 1/4 hour.

Time.--1/4 hour to roast; 10 minutes to broil.

Seasonable.--In full season in November.

Note.--Larks may also be plainly roasted, without covering them with egg and bread crumbs;
they should be dished on fried crumbs.

BROILED PIGEONS.

973. INGREDIENTS.--Pigeons, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Take care that the pigeons are quite fresh, and carefully pluck, draw, and wash them;
split the backs, rub the birds over with butter, season them with pepper and salt, and broil
them over a moderate fire for 1/4 hour or 20 minutes. Serve very hot, with either mushroom-sauce
or a good gravy. Pigeons may also be plainly boiled, and served with parsley and butter; they
should be trussed like boiled fowls, and take from 1/4 hour to 20 minutes to boil.

Time.--To broil a pigeon, from 1/4 hour to 20 minutes; to boil one, the same time.

Average cost, from 6d. to 9d. each.

Seasonable from April to September, but in the greatest perfection from midsummer to Michaelmas.

    THE POUTER PIGEON.--This is a very favourite pigeon, and,
    without doubt, the most curious of his species. He is a tail
    strong bird, as he had need be to carry about his great inflated
    crop, frequently as large and as round as a middling-sized
    turnip. A perfect pouter, seen on a windy day, is certainly a
    ludicrous sight: his feathered legs have the appearance of white
    trousers; his tapering tail looks like a swallow-tailed coat;
    his head is entirely concealed by his immense windy
    protuberance; and, altogether, he reminds you of a little
    "swell" of a past century, staggering under a bale of linen. The
    most common pouters are the blues, buffs, and whites, or an
    intermixture of all these various colours. The pouter is not a
    prolific breeder, is a bad nurse, and more likely to degenerate,
    if not repeatedly crossed and re-crossed with Irish stock, than
    any other pigeon: nevertheless, it is a useful bird to keep if
    you are founding a new colony, as it is much attached to its
    home, and little apt to stray; consequently it is calculated to
    induce more restless birds to fettle down and make themselves
    comfortable. If you wish to breed pouters, you cannot do worse
    than intrust them with the care of their own eggs.

ROAST PIGEONS.

974.

Trussing.--Pigeons, to be good, should be eaten fresh (if kept a little, the flavour goes off),
and they should be drawn as soon as killed. Cut off the heads and necks, truss the wings over
the backs, and cut off the toes at the first joint: previous to trussing, they should be carefully
cleaned, as no bird requires so much washing.

Mode.--Wipe the birds very dry, season them inside with pepper and salt, and put about 3/4
oz. of butter into the body of each: this makes them moist. Put them down to a bright fire,
and baste them well the whole of the time they are cooking (they will be done enough in from
20 to 30 minutes); garnish with fried parsley, and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter.
Bread-sauce and gravy, the same as for roast fowl, are exceedingly nice accompaniments to roast
pigeons, as also egg-sauce.

Time.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.

    THE PIGEON--The pigeon tribe forms a connecting ling between the
    passerine birds and poultry. They are widely distributed over
    the world, some of the species being found even in the arctic
    regions. Their chief food is grain, and they drink much; not at
    intervals, like other birds, but by a continuous draught, like
    quadrupeds. The wild pigeon, or stockdove, is the parent whence
    all the varieties of the domestic pigeon are derived. In the
    wild state it is still found in many parts of this island,
    making its nest in the holes of rocks, in the hollows of trees,
    or in old towers, but never, like the ringdove, on branches. The
    blue house-pigeon is the variety principally reared for the
    table in this country, and is produced from our farmyards in
    great numbers. When young, and still fed by their parents, they
    are most preferable for the table, and are called squabs;
    under six months they are denominated squeakers, and at six
    months they begin to breed. Their flesh is accounted savoury,
    delicate, and stimulating, and the dark-coloured birds are
    considered to have the highest flavour, whilst the light are
    esteemed to have the more delicate flesh.

    THE PIGEON-HOUSE, OR DOVECOT.--The first thing to be done
    towards keeping pigeons is to provide a commodious place for
    their reception; and the next is, to provide the pigeons
    themselves. The situation or size of the dovecot will
    necessarily depend on convenience; but there is one point which
    must invariably be observed, and that is, that every pair of
    pigeons has two holes or rooms to nest in. This is
    indispensable, as, without it, there will be no security, but
    the constant prospect of confusion, breaking of eggs, and the
    destruction of young. The proper place for the pigeon-house is
    the poultry-yard; but it does very well near dwellings, stables,
    brewhouses, bakehouses, or such offices. Some persons keep
    pigeons in rooms, and have them making their nests on the floor.
    The object is to escape the danger of the young falling out; but
    in such cases, there is a great risk of rats or other vermin
    getting at the pigeons.

    ASPECT OF THE PIGEON-HOUSE.--The front of the pigeon-house
    should have a southwest aspect, and, if a room be selected for
    the purpose, it is usual to break a hole in the roof of the
    building for the passage of the pigeons, but which can be closed
    at convenience. A platform ought to be laid at the entrance for
    the pigeons to perch upon, with some kind of defence against
    strange cats, which will frequently depopulate a whole dovecot.
    Yet, although cats are dangerous neighbours for the birds, they
    are necessary to defend them from the approach of rats and mice,
    which will not only suck the eggs, but destroy the birds. The
    platform should be painted white, and renewed as the paint wears
    off, white being a favourite colour with pigeons, and also most
    conspicuous as a mark to enable them to find their house. The
    boxes ought also to be similarly painted, and renewed when
    necessary, for which purpose lime and water will do very well.

    THE NECESSITY OF CLEANLINESS.--As cleanliness in human
    habitations is of the first importance, so is it in the
    pigeon-house. There the want of it will soon render the place a
    nuisance not to be approached, and the birds, both young and
    old, will be so covered with vermin and filth, that they will
    neither enjoy health nor comforts, whilst early mortality
    amongst them will be almost certain. In some cases, the
    pigeon-house is cleaned daily; but it should always be done, at
    any rate, once a week, and the floor covered with sifted gravel,
    frequently renewed. Pigeons being exceedingly fond of water, and
    having a prescience of the coming of rain, they may be seen upon
    the house-tops waiting upon it until late in the evening, and
    then spreading their wings to receive the luxury of the
    refreshing shower. When they are confined in a room, therefore,
    they should be allowed a wide pan of water, to be often renewed.
    This serves them for a bath, which cools, refreshes, and assists
    them to keep their bodies clear of vermin.

    BREEDING PIGEONS.--In breeding pigeons, it is necessary to match
    a cock and hen, and shut them up together, or place them near to
    each other, and in the course of a day or two there is little
    doubt of their mating. Various rules have been laid down for the
    purpose of assisting to distinguish the cock from the hen
    pigeon; but the masculine forwardness and action of the cock is
    generally so remarkable, that he is easily ascertained. The
    pigeon being monogamous, the male attaches and confines himself
    to one female, and the attachment is reciprocal, and the
    fidelity of the dove to its mate is proverbial. At the age of
    six months, young pigeons are termed squeakers, and then begin
    to breed, when properly managed. Their courtship, and the
    well-known tone of voice in the cock, just then acquired and
    commencing, are indications of their approaching union.
    Nestlings, while fed by cock and hen, are termed squabs, and
    are, at that age, sold and used for the table. The dove-house
    pigeon is said to breed monthly, when well supplied with food.
    At all events, it may be depended on, that pigeons of almost any
    healthy and well-established variety will breed eight or nine
    times in the year; whence it may readily be conceived how vast
    are the numbers that may be raised.

    THE CARRIER PIGEON.--Without doubt the carrier is entitled to
    rank first in the pigeon family, with the exception, perhaps, of
    the blue-rock pigeons. No domestic fowl can be traced to so
    remote an antiquity. When Greece was in its glory, carrier
    pigeons were used to convey to distant parts the names of the
    victors at the Olympian games. During the holy war, when Acre
    was besieged by King Richard, Saladin habitually corresponded
    with the besieged by means of carrier pigeons. A shaft from an
    English crossbow, however, happened to bring one of those
    feathered messengers to the ground, and the stratagem was
    discovered, the design of the Saracens revealed, and so turned
    against the designers, that Acre was in the hands of the
    Christians before the wily Saladin dreamt of such a thing.

PIGEON PIE (Epsom Grand-Stand Recipe).

975. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rump-steak, 2 or 3 pigeons, 3 slices of ham, pepper and salt
to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 4 eggs, puff crust.

Mode.--Cut the steak into pieces about 3 inches square, and with it line the bottom of a pie-dish,
seasoning it well with pepper and salt. Clean the pigeons, rub them with pepper and salt inside
and out, and put into the body of each rather more than 1/2 oz. of butter; lay them on the
steak, and a piece of ham on each pigeon. Add the yolks of 4 eggs, and half fill the dish with
stock; place a border of puff paste round the edge of the dish, put on the cover, and ornament
it in any way that may be preferred. Clean three of the feet, and place them in a hole made
in the crust at the top: this shows what kind of pie it is. When liked, a seasoning of pounded
mace may be added.

Time.--1-1/4 hour, or rather less. Average cost, 5s. 3d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

    TUMBLER PIGEONS.--The smaller the size of this variety, the
    greater its value. The head should be round and smooth, the neck
    thin, and the tail similar to that of the turbit. Highly-bred
    birds of this variety will attain an elevation in their flight
    beyond that of any other pigeons; and it is in seeing these
    little birds wing themselves so far into the skies that the
    fanciers take such delight. For four or five hours tumblers have
    been known to keep on the wing; and it is when they are almost
    lost to the power of human vision that they exhibit those
    pantomimic feats which give them their name, and which are
    marked by a tumbling over-and-over process, which suggests the
    idea of their having suddenly become giddy, been deprived of
    their self-control, or overtaken by some calamity. This
    acrobatic propensity in these pigeons has been ascribed by some
    to the absence of a proper power in the tail; but is nothing
    more than a natural habit, for which no adequate reason can be
    assigned. Of this variety, the Almond Tumbler is the most
    beautiful; and the greater the variation of the colour in the
    flight and tail, the greater their value.

    THE RUNT PIGEON.--This is generally esteemed among the largest
    of the pigeon varieties, and being possessed of proportionate
    strength, with a strong propensity to exercise it, they keep the
    dovecot in a state of almost continual commotion by domineering
    over the weaker inmates. They breed tolerably well, however, and
    are valuable for the table. There is both the Leghorn and the
    Spanish Runt, variously plumaged; but when red, white, or black
    mottled, are most highly esteemed. One of the great advantages
    connected with the Runt is, that he is not likely to fly away
    from home. Being heavy birds, they find it difficult, when well
    fed, to mount even to a low housetop. Again, they require no
    loft, or special dwelling-place, but, if properly tended, will
    be perfectly satisfied, and thrive as well, in a rabbit-hutch as
    any where. Their flavour is very good; and it is not an uncommon
    thing for a squeaker Runt to exceed a pound and a quarter in
    weight.

    THE NUN PIGEON.--The Tumbler bears a strong resemblance to this
    variety, which is characterized by a tuft of feathers rising
    from the back of the head, and which, on the whole, is an
    extremely pretty little bird. According to the colour of the
    head, it is called the red, black, or yellow-headed Nun. To be a
    perfect bird, it should have a small head and beak; and the
    larger the tuft at the back of his head, the handsomer the bird
    is esteemed, and proportionately valuable in the eyes of
    pigeon-fanciers.

    THE TRUMPETER PIGEON.--From the circumstance of this bird
    imitating the sound of a trumpet, instead of cooing, like other
    pigeons, it has received its designation. It is of the middle
    size, having its legs and feet covered with feathers, and its
    plumage generally of a mottled black-and-white. It has a tuft
    springing from the root of its beak, and the larger this topknot
    is, the higher the estimation in which the breed is held. In
    their powers of trumpeting some are more expert than others; and
    whether this has any effect in influencing their own estimate of
    themselves, we cannot say; but they are rather select in the
    choice of their company. If two of them are put in a
    pigeon-house with other doves, it will be found that they
    confine their association almost entirely to each other. As much
    as two guineas have been paid for a well-trained docile bird of
    this kind.

    THE WOOD, OR WILD PIGEON.--Buffon enumerates upwards of thirty
    varieties of the pigeon, which he derives from one root,--viz.
    the stockdove, or common wild pigeon. All the varieties of
    colour and form which we witness, he attributes to human
    contrivance and fancy. Nevertheless, there exist essentially
    specific differences in these birds, which would appear to be
    attributable rather to the nature of the region, soil, and
    climate to which they are indigenous, than to the art and
    ingenuity of man. The stockdove, in its wild state, is still
    found in some parts of Britain, forming its nest in the holes of
    rocks, old towers, and in the hollows of trees; it never,
    however, like the ringdove, nestles in the branches. Multitudes
    of wild pigeons still visit our shores in the winter, coming
    from their more northerly retreats, making their appearance
    about November, and retiring again in the spring. When forests
    of beechwood covered large tracts of the ground of this country,
    these birds used to haunt them in myriads, frequently covering a
    mile of ground in extent when they went out in the morning to
    feed.

STEWED PIGEONS.

976. INGREDIENTS.--6 pigeons, a few slices of bacon, 3 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced
parsley, sufficient stock No. 104 to cover the pigeons, thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful
of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of port wine.

Mode.--Empty and clean the pigeons thoroughly, mince the livers, add to these the parsley and
butter, and put it into the insides of the birds. Truss them with the legs inward, and put
them into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon placed under and over them; add the stock,
and stew gently for rather more than 1/2 hour. Dish the pigeons, strain the gravy, thicken
it with butter and flour, add the ketchup and port wine, give one boil, pour over the pigeons,
and serve.

Time.--Rather more than 1/2 hour. Average cost, 6d. to 9d. each.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from April to September.

    THE FANTAIL PIGEON.--This curious variety is inferior in point
    of size to most of the other varieties, and is characterized by
    having a short, slender bill, pendent wings, and naked legs and
    feet. It has the power of erecting its tail in the manner of a
    turkey-cock; during which action, especially when paying court
    to it's mate, it trembles or shakes, like the peacock when
    moving about with his train expanded and in full display. This
    power of erecting and spreading the tail is not confined to the
    male bird alone: the female possesses the same power to an equal
    extent, and otherwise resembles the male in every respect. It is
    not very prolific, and seldom succeeds so well in the aviary or
    pigeon-house as most of the other kinds.

    THE JACOBIN PIGEON.--This variety, having the power to transmit
    to posterity a form precisely similar, with all its peculiar
    characters undiminished, is, among pigeon-fanciers, designated
    as of a pure or permanent race. It is distinguished by a
    remarkable ruff or frill of raised feathers, which, commencing
    behind the head and proceeding down the neck and breast, forms a
    kind of hood, not unlike that worn by a monk. From this
    circumstance, it has obtained its Gallic name of nonnain
    capuchin. In size it is one of the smallest of the domestic
    pigeons, and its form is light and elegant. It is a very
    productive species, and, having its flight considerably impeded
    by the size and form of its hooded frill, keeps much at home,
    and is well adapted for the aviary or other buildings where
    pigeons are confined.

    THE TURBIT PIGEON.--This variety bears a strong resemblance to
    the Jacobin, having a kind of frill in the fore part of its
    neck, occasioned by the breast-feathers lying contrariwise and
    standing straight out. The species is classed in accordance with
    the colour of the shoulders, similarly as the Nuns are by the
    colour of their heads. Their characteristics of excellence are a
    full frill, short bill, and small round head. In Germany it is
    called the ruffle pigeon, in allusion to the feathers on its
    breast; and it has rarely any feathers on its feet. There is a
    peculiarity connected with this bird, which somewhat lowers it
    in the estimation of fanciers: it seldom rears more than one at
    a time, which, therefore, marks it as a bird rather for
    amusement than profit.

    THE BARB PIGEON.--The name of this variety is a contraction of
    Barbary, from which country it originally comes. It is both
    prolific and has excellent qualities as a nurse. The kind most
    esteemed is that of one uniform colour, that of blue-black being
    preferable to any other. Speckled or mottled Barbs are esteemed
    the most common of all pigeons. It is not unlike the Carrier
    pigeon, and, at a small distance, might easily be mistaken for
    the latter. It has a short beak and a small wattle. A spongy,
    pinky skin round the eyes is its chief characteristic, however,
    and this increases in size till the bird is three or four years
    old. This peculiarity is hardly distinguishable in very young
    birds.

    THE ROCK PIGEON.--This variety, in its wild state, is found upon
    the rocky parts of the west of Scotland, and the bold shores of
    the Western Isles, more abundant than in any other parts of the
    British islands. As the shores of the mainland are exposed to
    the muds of the Atlantic, and the comparatively small islands
    are surrounded by that ocean, the low grounds exposed to the
    west are seldom covered with snow for any length of time, and
    thus the birds easily find a supply of food. The numbers which
    there congregate are often very great, and the din of their
    united cry is sometimes very loud and even alarming. The love of
    home and the certainty of returning to it is very conspicuous in
    the rock-pigeon or biset, as it is called by the French.
    Flocks from different parts of the coasts often meet on the
    feeding-grounds; but when the time of returning to rest comes
    round, each one keeps to its own party.

    THE OWL PIGEON.--This pigeon does not seem to be so well known
    as it formerly was, if we may judge from the fact that few
    modern writers mention it. Like the Turbit pigeon, the Owl has a
    remarkable tuft of feathers on the breast, it having been
    compared by some to the frill of a shirt, and by others to a
    full-blown white rose. In size, it is not quite so large a
    pigeon as the Jacobin. It is said to be preferred in France,
    above other varieties, as a bird to rear and kill for the table.
    In England it is very far from being common; indeed, we have
    applied to several keepers of pigeons, who have fancied
    themselves acquainted with all the varieties of this bird, and
    they have been able to tell us nothing of it. Mr. Harrison Weir,
    our artist, however, has made his portrait from the life.

BOILED RABBIT.

977. INGREDIENTS.--Rabbit; water.

Mode.--For boiling, choose rabbits with smooth and sharp claws, as that denotes they are young:
should these be blunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, the animal is old. After emptying
and skinning it, wash it well in cold water, and let it soak for about 1/4 hour in warm water,
to draw out the blood. Bring the head round to the side, and fasten it there by means of a
skewer run through that and the body. Put the rabbit into sufficient hot water to cover it,
let it boil very gently until tender, which will be in from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, according to its
size and age. Dish it, and smother it either with onion, mushroom, or liver sauce, or parsley-and-butter;
the former is, however, generally preferred to any of the last-named sauces. When liver-sauce
is preferred, the liver should be boiled for a few minutes, and minced very finely, or rubbed
through a sieve before it is added to the sauce.

Time.--A very young rabbit, 1/2 hour; a large one, 3/4 hour; an old one, 1 hour or longer.

Average cost, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable from September to February.

    THE RABBIT.--Though this animal is an inhabitant of most
    temperate climates, it does not reach so far north as the hare.
    The wild rabbit is a native of Great Britain, and is found in
    large numbers in the sandy districts of Norfolk and
    Cambridgeshire. Its flesh is, by some, considered to have a
    higher flavour than that of the tame rabbit, although it is
    neither so white nor so delicate. The animal, however, becomes
    larger and fatter in the tame than in the wild state; but it is
    not desirable to have it so fat as it can be made.

CURRIED RABBIT.

978.

Mode.--Empty, skin, and wash the rabbit thoroughly, and cut it neatly into joints. Put it into
a stewpan with the butter and sliced onions, and let them acquire a nice brown colour, but
do not allow them to blacken. Pour in the stock, which should be boiling; mix the curry powder
and flour smoothly with a little water, add it to the stock, with the mushroom powder, and
simmer gently for rather more than 1/2 hour; squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve in the centre
of a dish, with an edging of boiled rice all round. Where economy is studied, water may be
substituted for the stock; in this case, the meat and onions must be very nicely browned. A
little sour apple and rasped cocoa-nut stewed with the curry will be found a great improvement.

    THE COMMON OR WILD RABBIT.--Warrens, or inclosures, are
    frequently made in favourable localities, and some of them are
    so large as to comprise 2,000 acres. The common wild rabbit is
    of a grey colour, and is esteemed the best for the purposes of
    food. Its skin is valuable as an article of commerce, being used
    for the making of hats. Another variety of the rabbit, however,
    called the "silver-grey," has been lately introduced to this
    country, and is still more valuable. Its colour is a black
    ground, thickly interspersed with grey hairs; and its powers as
    a destroyer and consumer of vegetable food are well known to be
    enormous, especially by those who have gardens in the vicinity
    of a rabbit-warren.

FRIED RABBIT.

979. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, flour, dripping, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot,
2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.

Mode.--Cut the rabbit into neat joints, and flour them well; make the dripping boiling in a
fryingpan, put in the rabbit, and fry it a nice brown. Have ready a very hot dish, put in the
butter, shalot, and ketchup; arrange the rabbit pyramidically on this, and serve as quickly
as possible.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from September to February.

Note.--The rabbit may be brushed over with egg, and sprinkled with bread crumbs, and fried
as above. When cooked in this manner, make a gravy in the pan by recipe No. 866, and pour it
round, but not over, the pieces of rabbit.

    VARIETIES IN RABBITS.--Almost everybody knows that a rabbit is a
    furry animal, that lives on plants, and burrows in the ground;
    that it has its varieties as well as other animals, and that it
    is frequently an especial favourite with boys. Among its
    varieties, the short-legged, with width and substance of loin,
    is the most hardy, and fattens the most expeditiously. It has,
    besides, the soundest liver, rabbits generally being subject to
    defects of that part. It is also the smallest variety. There is
    a very large species of the hare-colour, having much bone,
    length and depth of carcase, large and long ears, with full
    eyes, resembling those of the hare: it might readily be taken
    for a hybrid or mule, but for the objection to its breeding. Its
    flesh is high-coloured, substantial, and more savoury than that
    of the common rabbit; and, cooked like the hare, it makes a good
    dish. The large white, and yellow and white species, have whiter
    and more delicate flesh, and, cooked in the same way, will rival
    the turkey. Rabbits are divided into four kinds, distinguished
    as warreners, parkers, hedgehogs, and sweethearts. The warrener,
    as his name implies, is a member of a subterranean community,
    and is less effeminate than his kindred who dwell upon the
    earth and have "the world at their will," and his fur is the
    most esteemed. After him, comes the parker, whose favourite
    resort is a gentleman's pleasure-ground, where he usually breeds
    in great numbers, and from which he frequently drives away the
    hares. The hedgehog is a sort of vagabond rabbit, that, tinker
    like, roams about the country, and would have a much better coat
    on his back if he was more settled in his habits, and remained
    more at home. The sweetheart is a tame rabbit, with its fur so
    sleek, soft, and silky, that it is also used to some extent in
    the important branch of hat-making.

RABBIT A LA MINUTE.

980. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 1/4 lb. of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 2 blades of pounded
mace, 3 dried mushrooms, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, 2 teaspoonfuls of flour, 2 glasses
of sherry, 1 pint of water.

Mode.--Empty, skin, and wash the rabbit thoroughly, and cut it into joints. Put the butter
into a stewpan with the pieces of rabbit; add salt, pepper, and pounded mace, and let it cook
until three parts done; then put in the remaining ingredients, and boil for about 10 minutes:
it will then be ready to serve. Fowls or hare may be dressed in the same manner.

RABBIT PIE.

981.

Mode.--Cut up the rabbit (which should be young), remove the breastbone, and bone the legs.
Put the rabbit, slices of ham, forcemeat balls, and hard eggs, by turns, in layers, and season
each layer with pepper, salt, pounded mace, and grated nutmeg. Pour in about 1/2 pint of water,
cover with crust, and bake in a well-heated oven for about 1-1/2 hour. Should the crust acquire
too much colour, place a piece of paper over it to prevent its burning. When done, pour in
at the top, by means of the hole in the middle of the crust, a little good gravy, which may
be made of the breast- and leg-bones of the rabbit and 2 or 3 shank-bones, flavoured with onion,
herbs, and spices. 6d. each.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from September to February.

Note.--The liver of the rabbit may be boiled, minced, and mixed with the forcemeat balls, when
the flavour is liked.

    FECUNDITY OF THE RABBIT.--The fruitfulness of this animal has
    been the subject of wonder to all naturalists. It breeds seven
    times in the year, and generally begets seven or eight young
    ones at a time. If we suppose this to happen regularly for a
    period of four years, the progeny that would spring from a
    single pair would amount to more than a million. As the rabbit,
    however, has many enemies, it can never be permitted to increase
    in numbers to such an extent as to prove injurious to mankind;
    for it not only furnishes man with an article of food, but is,
    by carnivorous animals of every description, mercilessly
    sacrificed. Notwithstanding this, however, in the time of the
    Roman power, they once infested the Balearic islands to such an
    extent, that the inhabitants were obliged to implore the
    assistance of a military force from Augustus to exterminate
    them.

RAGOUT OF RABBIT OR HARE.

982. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 3 teaspoonfuls of flour, 3 sliced onions, 2 oz. of butter, a few
thin slices of bacon, pepper and salt to taste, 2 slices of lemon, 1 bay-leaf, 1 glass of port
wine.

Mode.--Slice the onions, and put them into a stewpan with the flour and butter; place the pan
near the fire, stir well as the butter melts, till the onions become a rich brown colour, and
add, by degrees, a little water or gravy till the mixture is of the consistency of cream. Cut
some thin slices of bacon; lay in these with the rabbit, cut into neat joints; add a seasoning
of pepper and salt, the lemon and bay-leaf, and let the whole simmer until tender. Pour in
the port wine, give one boil, and serve.

Time.--About 1/2 hour to simmer the rabbit. Forty years ago, there were in the
    metropolis one or two considerable feeders, who, according to
    report, kept from 1,600 to 2,000 breeding does. These large
    establishments, however, have ceased to exist, and London
    receives the supply of tame as well as wild rabbits chiefly from
    the country. Where they are kept, however, the rabbit-house
    should be placed upon a dry foundation, and be well ventilated.
    Exposure to rain, whether externally or internally, is fatal to
    rabbits, which, like sheep, are liable to the rot, springing
    from the same causes. Thorough ventilation and good air are
    indispensable where many rabbits are kept, or they will neither
    prosper nor remain healthy for any length of time. A thorough
    draught or passage for the air is, therefore, absolutely
    necessary, and should be so contrived as to be checked in cold
    or wet weather by the closing or shutting of opposite doors or
    windows.

ROAST OR BAKED RABBIT.

983. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, forcemeat No. 417, buttered paper, sausage-meat.

Mode.--Empty, skin, and thoroughly wash the rabbit; wipe it dry, line the inside with sausage-meat
and forcemeat made by recipe No. 417, and to which has been added the minced liver. Sew the
stuffing inside, skewer back the head between the shoulders, cut off the fore-joints of the
shoulders and legs, bring: them close to the body, and secure them by means of a skewer. Wrap
the rabbit in buttered paper, and put it down to a bright clear fire; keep it well basted,
and a few minutes before it is done remove the paper, flour and froth it, and let it acquire
a nice brown colour. Take out the skewers, and serve with brown gravy and red-currant jelly.
To bake the rabbit, proceed in the same manner as above; in a good oven, it will take about
the same time as roasting.

    THE HUTCH.--Hutches are generally placed one above another to
    the height required by the number of rabbits and the extent of
    the room. Where a large stock is kept, to make the most of room,
    the hutches may be placed in rows, with a sufficient interval
    between for feeding and cleaning, instead of being, in the usual
    way, joined to the wall. It is preferable to rest the hutches
    upon stands, about a foot above the ground, for the convenience
    of cleaning under them. Each of the hutches intended for
    breeding should have two rooms,--a feeding and a bed-room. Those
    are single for the use of the weaned rabbits, or for the bucks,
    which are always kept separate. The floors should be planed
    smooth, that wet may run off, and a common hoe, with a short
    handle, and a short broom, are most convenient implements for
    cleaning these houses.

STEWED RABBIT.

984. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 2 large onions, 6 cloves, 1 small teaspoonful of chopped lemon-peel,
a few forcemeat balls, thickening of butter and flour, 1 large tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.

Mode.--Cut the rabbit into small joints; put them into a stewpan, add the onions sliced, the
cloves, and minced lemon-peel. Pour in sufficient water to cover the meat, and, when the rabbit
is nearly done, drop in a few forcemeat balls, to which has been added the liver, finely chopped.
Thicken the gravy with flour and butter, put in the ketchup, give one boil, and serve.

    FANCY RABBITS.--The graceful fall of the ears is the first thing
    that is looked to by the fancier; next, the dewlap, if the
    animal is in its prime; then the colours and marked points, and,
    lastly, the shape and general appearance. The ears of a fine
    rabbit should extend not less than seven inches, measured from
    tip to tip in a line across the skull; but even should they
    exceed this length, they are admitted with reluctance into a
    fancy stock, unless they have a uniform and graceful droop. The
    dewlap, which is a fold of skin under the neck and throat, is
    only seen in fancy rabbits, after they have attained their full
    growth: it commences immediately under the jaw, and adds greatly
    to the beauty of their appearance. It goes down the throat and
    between the fore legs, and is so broad that it projects beyond
    the chin.

    The difference between the fancy and common rabbit in the back,
    independent of the ears, is sufficient to strike the common
    observer. Fancy rabbits fetch a very high price; so much as five
    and ten guineas, and even more, is sometimes given for a
    first-rate doe. If young ones are first procured from a good
    family, the foundation of an excellent stock can be procured for
    a much smaller sum. Sometimes the ears, instead of drooping
    down, slope backwards: a rabbit with this characteristic is
    scarcely admitted into a fancy lot, and is not considered worth
    more than the common variety. The next position is when one ear
    lops outwards, and the other stands erect: rabbits of this kind
    possess but little value, however fine the shape and beautiful
    the colour, although they sometimes breed as good specimens as
    finer ones.

    The forward or horn-lop is one degree nearer perfection than the
    half-lop: the ears, in this case, slope forward and down over
    the forehead. Rabbits with this peculiarity are often perfect in
    other respects, with the exception of the droop of the ears, and
    often become the parents of perfect young ones: does of this
    kind often have the power of lifting an ear erect. In the
    ear-lop, the ears spread out in an horizontal position, like the
    wings of a bird in flight, or the arms of a man swimming. A
    great many excellent does have this characteristic, and some of
    the best-bred bucks in the fancy are entirely so. Sometimes a
    rabbit drops one ear completely, but raises the other so neatly
    horizontally as to constitute an ear-lop: this is superior to
    all others, except the perfect fall, which is so rarely to be
    met with, that those which are merely ear-lopped are considered
    as valuable rabbits, if well bred and with other good qualities.

    "The real lop has ears that hang down by the side of the cheek,
    slanting somewhat outward in their descent, with the open part
    of the ear inward, and sometimes either backwards or forwards
    instead of perpendicular: when the animals stand in an easy
    position, the tips of the ears touch the ground. The hollows of
    the ears, in a fancy rabbit of a first-rate kind, should be
    turned so completely backwards that only the outer part of them
    should remain in front: they should match exactly in their
    descent, and should slant outwards as little as possible."

    The same authority asserts that perfect lops are so rare, that a
    breeder possessing twenty of the handsomest and most perfect
    does would consider himself lucky if, in the course of a year,
    he managed to raise twelve full-lopped rabbits out of them all.
    As regards variety and purity of colour an experienced breeder
    says:--

    "The fur of fancy rabbits may be blue, or rather lead-colour,
    and white, or black and white, or tawny and white, that is,
    tortoiseshell-coloured. But it is not of so much importance what
    colours the coat of a rabbit displays, as it is that those
    colours shall be arranged in a particular manner, forming
    imaginary figures or fancied resemblances to certain objects.
    Hence the peculiarities of their markings have been denoted by
    distinctive designations. What is termed 'the blue butterfly
    smut' was, for some time, considered the most valuable of fancy
    rabbits. It is thus named on account of having bluish or
    lead-coloured spots on either side of the nose, having some
    resemblance to the spread wings of a butterfly, what may be
    termed the groundwork of the rabbit's face being white. A black
    and white rabbit may also have the face marked in a similar
    manner, constituting a 'black butterfly smut.'

    "But A good fancy rabbit must likewise have other marks, without
    which it cannot be considered a perfect model of its kind. There
    should be a black or blue patch on its back, called the saddle;
    the tail must be of the same colour with the back and snout;
    while the legs should be all white; and there ought to be dark
    stripes on both sides of the body in front, passing backwards to
    meet the saddle, and uniting on the top of the shoulders at the
    part called the withers in a horse. These stripes form what is
    termed the 'chain' having somewhat the appearance of a chain or
    collar hanging round the neck."

    "Among thorough-bred fancy rabbits, perhaps not one in a hundred
    will have all these markings clearly and exactly displayed on
    the coat; but the more nearly the figures on the coat of a
    rabbit approach to the pattern described, the greater will be
    its value, so far, at least, as relates to colour. The beauty
    and consequent worth of a fancy rabbit, however, depends a good
    deal on its shape, or what is styled its carriage. A rabbit is
    said to have a good carriage when its back is finely arched,
    rising full two inches above the top of its head, which must be
    held so low as for the muzzle and the points of the ears to
    reach almost to the ground."

STEWED RABBIT, Larded.

985. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, a few strips of bacon, rather more than 1 pint of good broth or
stock, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, thickening of butter and flour,
1 glass of sherry.

Mode.--Well wash the rabbit, cut it into quarters, lard them with Blips of bacon, and fry them;
then put them into a stewpan with the broth, herbs, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; simmer
gently until the rabbit is tender, then strain the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour,
add the sherry, give one boil, pour it over the rabbit, and serve. Garnish with slices of cut
lemon.

    THE HARE-RABBIT.--There has been lately introduced to French
    tables an animal called the "Hare-rabbit," partaking of the
    nature, characteristics, and qualifications of both the hare and
    the rabbit. It is highly spoken of, both as regards flesh and
    flavour; and it is said to be the only hybrid which is able to
    perpetuate its race. We hope that some enterprising individual
    will soon secure for English, tables what would seem to be a
    really valuable addition to our other game and poultry dishes;
    although it will be rather difficult to exactly assign its
    proper position, as within or without the meaning of "game," as
    by law established. Only a few specimens have been seen in
    England at present, but there is no reason to doubt that our
    rabbit-fanciers will prove equal to the occasion, and cope
    successfully with our neighbours across the Channel in
    introducing a new animal serviceable in the kitchen.

    THE ANGORA RABBIT.--This is one of the handsomest of all
    rabbits. It takes its name from being an inhabitant of Angora, a
    city and district of Asia Minor. Like the well-known Angora goat
    and cat, both of which are valuable on account of the fineness
    of their wool and fur, this rabbit is prized for its long,
    waved, silky fur, which, as an article of commerce is highly
    esteemed. We are not aware whether it is eaten by the
    inhabitants, and but few specimens have been introduced into
    England, where, doubtless, the beauty of its coat would
    materially suffer from the more humid and less genial character
    of the climate.

    THE HIMALAYA RABBIT.--Amidst the mighty Himalaya mountains,
    whose peaks are the highest on the globe, the pretty rabbit here
    portrayed is found; and his colour seems to be like the snow,
    which, above the altitude of from 13,000 to 16,000 feet,
    perpetually crowns the summits of these monarchs of the world.
    It is, at present, a very rare animal in England, but will,
    doubtless, be more extensively known in the course of a few
    years. From the earth-tunnelling powers of this little animal,
    Martial declares that mankind learned the art of fortification,
    mining, and covered roads.

BOILED TURKEY.

986. INGREDIENTS.--Turkey; forcemeat No. 417.

Choosing and Trussing.--Hen turkeys are preferable for boiling, on account of their whiteness
and tenderness, and one of moderate size should be selected, as a large one is not suitable
for this mode of cooking. They should not be dressed until they have been killed 3 or 4 days,
as they will neither look white, nor will they be tender. Pluck the bird, carefully draw, and
singe it with a piece of white paper, wash it inside and out, and wipe it thoroughly dry with
a cloth. Cut off the head and neck, draw the strings or sinews of the thighs, and cut off the
legs at the first joint; draw the legs into the body, fill the breast with forcemeat made by
recipe No. 417; run a skewer through the wing and the middle joint of the leg, quite into the
leg and wing on the opposite side; break the breastbone, and make the bird look as round and
as compact as possible.

Mode.--Put the turkey into sufficient hot water to cover it; let it come to a boil, then carefully
remove all the scum: if this is attended to, there is no occasion to boil the bird in a floured
cloth; but it should be well covered with the water. Let it simmer very gently for about 1-1/2
hour to 1-3/4 hour, according to the size, and serve with either white, celery, oyster, or
mushroom sauce, or parsley-and-butter, a little of which should be poured over the turkey.
Boiled ham, bacon, tongue, or pickled pork, should always accompany this dish; and when oyster
sauce is served, the turkey should be stuffed with oyster forcemeat.

Time.--A small turkey, 1-1/2 hour; a large one, 1-3/4 hour.

Average cost, 5s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. each, but more expensive at Christmas, on account of the great
demand.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from December to February.

    THE TURKEY.--The turkey, for which fine bird we are indebted to
    America, is certainly one of the most glorious presents made by
    the New World to the Old. Some, indeed, assert that this bird
    was known to the ancients, and that it was served at the
    wedding-feast of Charlemagne. This opinion, however, has been
    controverted by first-rate authorities, who declare that the
    French name of the bird, dindon, proves its origin; that the
    form of the bird is altogether foreign, and that it is found in
    America alone in a wild state. There is but little doubt, from
    the information which has been gained at considerable trouble,
    that it appeared, generally, in Europe about the end of the 17th
    century; that it was first imported into France by Jesuits, who
    had been sent out missionaries to the West; and that from France
    it spread over Europe. To this day, in many localities in
    France, a turkey is called a Jesuit. On the farms of N. America,
    where turkeys are very common, they are raised either from eggs
    which have been found, or from young ones caught in the woods:
    they thus preserve almost entirely their original plumage. The
    turkey only became gradually acclimated, both on the continent
    and in England: in the middle of the 18th century, scarcely 10
    out of 20 young turkeys lived; now, generally speaking, 15 out
    of the same number arrive at maturity.

CROQUETTES OF TURKEY (Cold Meat Cookery).

987. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turkey; to every 1/2 lb. of meat allow 2 oz. of ham
or bacon, 2 shalots, 1 oz. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, egg and
bread crumbs.

Mode.--The smaller pieces, that will not do for a fricassée or hash, answer very well for this
dish. Mince the meat finely with ham or bacon in the above proportion; make a gravy of the
bones and trimmings, well seasoning it; mince the shalots, put them into a stewpan with the
butter, add the flour; mix well, then put in the mince, and about 1/2 pint of the gravy made
from the bones. (The proportion of the butter must be increased or diminished according to
the quantity of mince.) When just boiled, add the yolks of 2 eggs; put the mixture out to cool,
and then shape it in a wineglass. Cover the croquettes with egg and bread crumbs, and fry them
a delicate brown. Put small pieces of parsley-stems for stalks, and serve with, rolled bacon
cut very thin.

Time.--8 minutes to fry the croquettes.

Seasonable from December to February.

    THE WILD TURKEY.--In its wild state, the turkey is gregarious,
    going together in extensive flocks, numbering as many as five
    hundred. These frequent the great swamps of America, where they
    roost; but, at sunrise, leave these situations to repair to the
    dry woods, in search of berries and acorns. They perch on the
    boughs of trees, and, by rising from branch to branch, attain
    the height they desire. They usually mount to the highest tops,
    apparently from an instinctive conception that the loftier they
    are the further they are out of danger. They fly awkwardly, but
    run with great swiftness, and, about the month of March become
    so fat as not to be able to take a flight beyond three or four
    hundred yards, and are then, also, easily run down by a
    horseman. Now, however, it rarely happens that wild turkeys are
    seen in the inhabited parts of America. It is only in the
    distant and more unfrequented parts that they are found in great
    numbers.

FRICASSEED TURKEY (Cold Meat Cookery).

988. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled turkey; a strip of lemon-peel, a bunch
of savoury herbs, 1 onion, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream,
the yolk of an egg.

Mode.--Cut some nice slices from the remains of a cold turkey, and put the bones and trimmings
into a stewpan, with the lemon-peel, herbs, onion, pepper, salt, add the water; stew for an
hour, strain the gravy, and lay in the pieces of turkey. When warm through, add the cream and
the yolk of an egg; stir it well round, and, when getting thick, take out the pieces, lay them
on a hot dish, and pour the sauce over. Garnish the fricassée with sippets of toasted bread.
Celery or cucumbers, cut into small pieces, may be put into the sauce; if the former, it must
be boiled first.

Seasonable from December to February.

    THE TURKEY.--This is one of the gallinaceous birds, the
    principal genera of which are Pheasants, Turkeys, Peacocks,
    Bustards, Pintatoes, and Grouse. They live mostly on the ground,
    scraping the earth with their feet, and feeding on seeds and
    grains, which, previous to digestion, are macerated in their
    crops. They usually associate in families, consisting of one
    male and several females. Turkeys are particularly fond of the
    seeds of nettles, whilst the seeds of the foxglove will poison
    them. The common turkey is a native of North America, and, in
    the reign of Henry VIII., was introduced into England.

    The turkey is one of the most difficult birds to rear, and its
    flesh is much esteemed.

    THE DISPOSITION OF THE TURKEY.--Among themselves, turkeys are
    extremely furious, whilst amongst other animals they are usually
    both weak and cowardly. The domestic cock frequently makes them
    keep at a distance, whilst they will rarely attack him but in a
    united body, when the cock is rather crushed by their weight
    than defeated by their prowess. The disposition of the female is
    in general much more gentle than that of the male. When leading
    forth her young to collect their food, though so large and
    apparently so powerful a bird, she gives them very slight
    protection from the attacks of any rapacious animal which may
    appear against them. She rather warns them of their danger than
    offers to defend them; yet she is extremely affectionate to her
    young.

HASHED TURKEY.

989.

Mode.--Cut the turkey into neat joints; the best pieces reserve for the hash, the inferior
joints and trimmings put into a stewpan with an onion cut in slices, pepper and salt, a carrot,
turnip, mace, herbs, and water in the above proportion; simmer these for an hour, then strain
the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, flavour with ketchup and port wine, and lay in
the pieces of turkey to warm through; if there is any stuffing left, put that in also, as it
so much improves the flavour of the gravy. When it boils, serve, and garnish the dish with
sippets of toasted bread.

Time.--1 hour to make the gravy.

Seasonable from December to February.

    HUNTING TURKEYS.--Formerly, in Canada, hunting turkeys was one
    of the principal diversions of the natives of that country. When
    they discovered the retreat of the birds, which was generally
    near a field of nettles, or where grain of any kind was
    plentiful, they would send a well-trained dog into the midst of
    the flock. The turkeys no sooner perceived their enemy than they
    would run off at full speed, and with such swiftness that they
    would leave the dog far behind. He, however, would follow in
    their wake, and as they could not, for a great length of time,
    continue at their speed, they were at last forced to seek
    shelter in the trees. There they would sit, spent with fatigue,
    till the hunters would approach, and, with long poles, knock
    them down one after the other.

ROAST TURKEY.

990. INGREDIENTS.--Turkey; forcemeat No. 417.

Choosing and Trussing.--Choose cock turkeys by their short spurs and black legs, in which case
they are young; if the spurs are long, and the legs pale and rough, they are old. If the bird
has been long killed, the eyes will appear sunk and the feet very dry; but, if fresh, the contrary
will be the case. Middling-sized fleshy turkeys are by many persons considered superior to
those of an immense growth, as they are, generally speaking, much more tender. They should
never be dressed the same day they are killed; but, in cold weather, should hang at least 8
days; if the weather is mild, 4 or 5 days will be found sufficient. Carefully pluck the bird,
singe it with white paper, and wipe it thoroughly with a cloth; draw it, preserve the liver
and gizzard, and be particular not to break the gall-bag, as no washing will remove the bitter
taste it imparts where it once touches. Wash it inside well, and wipe it thoroughly dry with
a cloth; the outside merely requires nicely wiping, as we have just stated. Cut off the neck
close to the back, but leave enough of the crop-skin to turn over; break the leg-bone close
below the knee, draw out the strings from the thighs, and flatten the breastbone to make it
look plump. Have ready a forcemeat made by recipe No. 417; fill the breast with this, and,
if a trussing-needle is used, sew the neck over to the back; if a needle is not at hand, a
skewer will answer the purpose. Run a skewer through the pinion and thigh into the body to
the pinion and thigh on the other side, and press the legs as much as possible between the
breast and the side bones, and put the liver under one pinion and the gizzard under the other.
Pass a string across the back of the bird, catch it over the points of the skewer, tie it in
the centre of the back, and be particular that the turkey is very firmly trussed. This may
be more easily accomplished with a needle and twine than with skewers.

Mode.--Fasten a sheet of buttered paper on to the breast of the bird, put it down to a bright
fire, at some little distance at first (afterwards draw it nearer), and keep it well basted
the whole of the time it is cooking. About 1/4 hour before serving, remove the paper, dredge
the turkey lightly with flour, and put a piece of butter into the basting-ladle; as the butter
melts, baste the bird with it. When of a nice brown and well frothed, serve with a tureen of
good brown gravy and one of bread sauce. Fried sausages are a favourite addition to roast turkey;
they make a pretty garnish, besides adding very much to the flavour. When these are not at
hand, a few forcemeat balls should be placed round the dish as a garnish. Turkey may also be
stuffed with sausage-meat, and a chestnut forcemeat with the same sauce is, by many persons,
much esteemed as an accompaniment to this favourite dish.--See coloured plate, A1.

Time.--Small turkey, 1-1/2 hour; moderate-sized one, about 10 lbs., 2 hours; large turkey,
2-1/2 hours, or longer.

Average cost, from 10s. to 12s., but expensive at Christmas, on account of the great demand.

Sufficient.--A moderate-sized turkey for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from December to February.

    ENGLISH TURKEYS.--These are reared in great numbers in Suffolk,
    Norfolk, and several other counties, whence they were wont to be
    driven to the London market in flocks of several hundreds; the
    improvements in our modes of travelling now, however, enable
    them to be brought by railway. Their drivers used to manage them
    with great facility, by means of a bit of red rag tied to the
    end of a long stick, which, from the antipathy these birds have
    to that colour, effectually answered the purpose of a scourge.
    There are three varieties of the turkey in this country,--the
    black, the white, and the speckled, or copper-coloured. The
    black approaches nearest to the original stock, and is esteemed
    the best. Its flesh is white and tender, delicate, nourishing,
    and of excellent flavour; it greatly deteriorates with age,
    however, and is then good for little but stewing.

ROAST TURKEY POULTS.

991. INGREDIENTS.--Turkey poult; butter.

Choosing and Trussing.--Choose a plump bird, and truss it in the following manner:--After it
has been carefully plucked, drawn, and singed, skin the neck, and fasten the head under the
wing; turn the legs at the first joint, and bring the feet close to the thighs, as a woodcock
should be trussed, and do not stuff it.

Mode.--Put it down to a bright fire, keep it well basted, and at first place a piece of paper
on the breast to prevent its taking too much colour. About 10 minutes before serving, dredge
it lightly with flour, and baste well; when nicely frothed, send it to table immediately, with
a little gravy in the dish, and some in a tureen. If at hand, a few water-cresses may be placed
round the turkey as a garnish, or it may be larded.

Time.--About 1 hour. Average cost, 7s. to 8s. each.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable.--In full season from June to October.

    THE FUTURE OF THE TURKEY.--Human ingenuity subjects almost every
    material to the purposes of ornament or use and the feathers of
    turkeys have been found adapted for more ends than one. The
    American Indians convert then into an elegant clothing, and, by
    twisting the inner ribs into a strong double string, with hemp
    or the inner bark of the mulberry tree, work it like matting.
    This fabric has a very rich and glossy appearance and is as fine
    as silk shag. The natives of Louisiana used to make fans of the
    tail; and four of that appendage joined together was formerly
    constructed into a parasol by the French.

TO BONE A TURKEY OR FOWL WITHOUT OPENING IT.

(Miss Acton's Recipe.)

992. After the fowl has been drawn and singed, wipe it inside and out with a clean cloth, but
do not wash it. Take off the head, cut through the skin all round the first joint of the legs,
and pull them from the fowl, to draw out the large tendons. Raise the flesh first from the
lower part of the backbone, and a little also from the end of the breastbone, if necessary;
work the knife gradually to the socket of the thigh; with the point of the knife detach the
joint from it, take the end of the bone firmly in the fingers, and cut the flesh clean from
it down to the next joint, round which pass the point of the knife carefully, and when the
skin is loosened from it in every part, cut round the next bone, keeping; the edge of the knife
close to it, until the whole of the leg is done. Remove the bones of the other leg in the same
manner; then detach the flesh from the back--and breast-bone sufficiently to enable you to
reach the upper joints of the wings; proceed with these as with the legs, but be especially
careful not to pierce the skin of the second joint: it is usual to leave the pinions unboned,
in order to give more easily its natural form to the fowl when it is dressed. The merrythought
and neck-bones may now easily be cut away, the back-and side-bones taken out without being
divided, and the breastbone separated carefully from the flesh (which, as the work progresses,
must be turned back from the bones upon the fowl, until it is completely inside out). After
the one remaining bone is removed, draw the wings and legs back to their proper form, and turn
the fowl right side outwards.

993. A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner; but as it requires a very large proportion
of forcemeat to fill it entirely, the logs and wings are sometimes drawn into the body, to
diminish the expense of this. If very securely trussed, and sewn, the bird may be either boiled,
or stewed in rich gravy, as well as roasted, after being boned and forced; but it must be most
gently cooled, or it may burst.

ANOTHER MODE OF BONING A TURKEY OR FOWL. (Miss Acton's Recipe.)

994. Cut through the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the flesh carefully on either
side with the point of a sharp knife, until the sockets of the wings and thighs are reached.
Till a little practice has been gained, it will perhaps be bettor to bone these joints before
proceeding further; but after they are once detached from it, the whole of the body may easily
be separated from the flesh and taken out entire: only the neck-bones and merrythought will
then remain to be removed. The bird thus prepared may either be restored to its original form,
by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the body with the livers of two or three
fowls, mixed with alternate layers of parboiled tongue freed from the rind, fine sausage-meat,
or veal forcemeat, or thin slices of the nicest bacon, or aught else of good flavour, which
will give a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is carved; and then be sewn up and trussed
as usual; or the legs and wings may be drawn inside the body, and the bird being first flattened
on a table, may be covered with sausage-meat, and the various other ingredients we have named,
so placed that it shall be of equal thickness in every part; then tightly rolled, bound firmly
together with a fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding-cloth, closely tied at both
ends, and dressed as follows:--Put it into a braising-pan, stewpan, or thick iron saucepan,
bright in the inside, and fitted as nearly as may be to its size; add all the chicken-bones,
a bunch of sweet herbs, two carrots, two bay-leaves, a large blade of mace, twenty-four white
peppercorns, and any trimmings or bones of undressed veal which may be at hand; cover the whole
with good veal broth, add salt, if needed, and stew it very softly, from an hour and a quarter
to an hour and a half; let it cool in the liquor in which it was stewed; and after it is lifted
out, boil down the gravy to a jelly and strain it; let it become cold, clear off the fat, and
serve it cut into large dice or roughed, and laid round the fowl, which is to be served cold.
If restored to its form, instead of being rolled, it must be stewed gently for an hour, and
may then be sent to table hot, covered with mushroom, or any other good sauce that may be preferred;
or it may be left until the following day, and served garnished with the jelly, which should
be firm, and very clear and well-flavoured: the liquor in which a calf's foot has been boiled
down, added to the broth, will give it the necessary degree of consistence.

TO BONE FOWLS FOR FRICASSEES, CURRIES, & PIES.

995. First carve them entirely into joints, then remove the bones, beginning with the legs
and wings, at the head of the largest bone; hold this with the fingers, and work the knife
as directed in the recipe above. The remainder of the birds is too easily done to require any
instructions.

TO DRESS WHEATEARS.

996. INGREDIENTS.--Wheatears; fresh butter.

Mode.--After the birds are picked, gutted, and cleaned, truss them like larks, put them down
to a quick fire, and baste them well with fresh butter. When done, which will be in about 20
minutes, dish them on fried bread crumbs, and garnish the dish with slices of lemon.

Time.--20 minutes.

Seasonable from July to October.

    THE WHEATEAR.--The wheatear is an annual visitor of England: it
    arrives about the middle of March and leaves in September. The
    females come about a fortnight before the males, and continue to
    arrive till the middle of May. They are in season from July to
    October, and are taken in large numbers on the South Downs, in
    the neighbourhood of Eastbourne, Brighton, and other parts of
    Sussex. They are taken by means of snares and nets, and numbers
    of them are eaten on the spot by the inhabitants. The larger
    ones are sent to London and potted, where they are by many as
    much esteemed as the ortolans of the continent. Mr. Pennant
    assigns as the reason of their abounding on the downs about
    Eastbourne, the existence of a species of fly which forms their
    favourite food, and which feeds on the wild thyme on the
    adjacent hills.

    997. THE GUINEA-PIG.--This common hutch-companion of the rabbit,
    although originally a native of Brazil, propagates freely in
    England and other European countries. Were it not that they
    suffer cruelly from cats, and numerous other enemies, and that
    it is the habit of the males to devour their own offspring,
    their numbers would soon become overwhelming. Rats, however, it
    is said, carefully avoid them; and for this reason they are
    frequently bred by rabbit-fanciers, by way of protection for
    their young stock against those troublesome vermin. The lower
    tier of a rabbit-hutch is esteemed excellent quarters by the
    guinea-pig: here, as he runs loose, he will devour the waste
    food of his more admired companion. Home naturalists assert that
    the guinea-pig will breed at two months old, the litter varying
    from four to twelve at a time. It is varied in colour,--white,
    fawn, and black, and a mixture of the three colours, forming a
    tortoiseshell, which is the more generally admired hue.
    Occasionally, the white ones have red eyes, like those of the
    ferret and the white rabbit. Their flesh, although eatable, is
    decidedly unfit for food; they have been tasted, however, we
    presume by some enthusiast eager to advance the cause of
    science, or by some eccentric epicure in search of a new
    pleasure for his palate. Unless it has been that they deter rats
    from intruding within the rabbit-hutch, they are as useless as
    they are harmless. The usual ornament of an animal's hind
    quarters is denied them; and were it not for this fact, and also
    for their difference in colour, the Shaksperean locution, "a rat
    without a tail," would designate them very properly.

    998. THE CYGNET.--The Cygnet, or the young Swan, was formerly
    much esteemed; but it has "fallen from its high estate," and is
    now rarely seen upon the table. We are not sure that it is not
    still fattened in Norwich for the corporation of that place.
    Persons who have property on the river there, take the young
    birds, and send them to some one who is employed by the
    corporation, to be fed; and for this trouble he is paid, or was
    wont to be paid, about half a guinea a bird.

POULTRY CARVING.

ROAST DUCK.

999. No dishes require so much knowledge and skill in their carving as do game and poultry;
for it is necessary to be well acquainted with the anatomy of the bird and animal in order
to place the knife at exactly the proper point. A tough fowl and an old goose are sad triers
of a carver's powers and temper, and, indeed, sometimes of the good humour of those in the
neighbourhood of the carver; for a sudden tilt of the dish may eventuate in the placing a quantity
of the gravy in the lap of the right or left-hand supporter of the host. We will endeavour
to assist those who are unacquainted with the "gentle art of carving," and also those who are
but slightly acquainted with it, by simply describing the rules to follow, and referring to
the distinctly-marked Illustrations of each dish, which will further help to bring light to
the minds of the uninitiated. If the bird be a young duckling, it may be carved like a fowl,
viz., by first taking off the leg and the wing on either side, as described at No. 1000; but
in cases where the duckling is very small, it will be as well not to separate the leg from
the wing, as they will not then form too large a portion for a single serving. After the legs
and wings are disposed of, the remainder of the duck will be also carved in the same manner
as a fowl; and not much difficulty will be experienced, as ducklings are tender, and the joints
are easily broken by a little gentle forcing, or penetrated by the knife. In cases where the
duck is a large bird, the better plan to pursue is then to carve it like a goose, that is,
by cutting pieces from the breast in the direction indicated by the lines marked from 1 to
2, commencing to carve the slices close to the wing, and then proceeding upwards from that
to the breastbone. If more should be wanted than can be obtained from both sides of the breast,
then the legs and wings must be attacked, in the same way as is described in connection with
carving a fowl. It may be here remarked, that as the legs of a duck are placed far more backward
than those of a fowl, their position causing the waddling motion of the bird, the thigh-bones
will be found considerably nearer towards the backbone than in a chicken: this is the only
difference worth mentioning. The carver should ask each guest if a portion of stuffing would
be agreeable; and in order to get at this, a cut should be made below the breast, as shown
by the line from 3 to 4, at the part called the "apron," and the spoon inserted. (As described
in the recipe, it is an excellent plan, when a couple of ducks are served, to have one with,
and the other without stuffing.) As to the prime parts of a duck, it has been said that "the
wing of a flier and the leg of a swimmer" are severally the best portions. Some persons are
fond of the feet of the duck; and, in trussing, these should never be taken off. The leg, wing,
and neckbone are here shown; so that it will be easy to see the shape they should be when cut off.

BOILED FOWL.

1000. This will not be found a very difficult member of the poultry family to carve, unless,
as may happen, a very old farmyard occupant, useless for egg-laying purposes, has, by some
unlucky mischance, been introduced info the kitchen as a "fine young chicken." Skill, however,
and the application of a small amount of strength, combined with a fine keeping of the temper,
will even get over that difficulty. Fixing the fork firmly in the breast, let the knife be
sharply passed along the line shown from 1 to 2; then cut downwards from that line to fig.
3; and the wing, it will be found, can be easily withdrawn. The shape of the wing should be
like the accompanying engraving. Let the fork be placed inside the leg, which should be gently
forced away from the body of the fowl; and the joint, being thus discovered, the carver can
readily cut through it, and the leg can be served. When the leg is displaced, it should be
of the same shape as that shown in the annexed woodcut. The legs and wings on either side having
been taken off, the carver should draw his knife through the flesh in the direction of the
line 4 to 5: by this means the knife can be slipped underneath the merrythought, which, being
lifted up and pressed backward, will immediately come off. The collar--or neck-bones are the
next to consider: these lie on each side of the merrythought, close under the upper part of
the wings; and, in order to free these from the fowl, they must also be raised by the knife
at their broad end, and turned from the body towards the breastbone, until the shorter piece
of the bone, as shown in the cut, breaks off. There will now be left only the breast, with
the ribs. The breast can be, without difficulty, disengaged from the ribs by cutting through
the latter, which will offer little impediment. The side-bones are now to be taken off; and
to do this, the lower end of the back should be turned from the carver, who should press the
point of the knife through the top of the backbone, near the centre, bringing it down towards
the end of the back completely through the bone. If the knife is now turned in the opposite
direction, the joint will be easily separated from the vertebra. The backbone being now uppermost,
the fork should be pressed firmly down on it, whilst at the same time the knife should be employed
in raising up the lower small end of the fowl towards the fork, and thus the back will be dislocated
about its middle. The wings, breast, and merrythought are esteemed the prime parts of a fowl,
and are usually served to the ladies of the company, to whom legs, except as a matter of paramount
necessity, should not be given. Byron gave it as one reason why he did not like dining with
ladies, that they always had the wings of the fowls, which he himself preferred. We heard a
gentleman who, when he might have had a wing, declare his partiality for a leg, saying that
he had been obliged to eat legs for so long a time, that he had at last come to like them better
than the other more prized parts. If the fowl is, capon-like, very large, slices maybe carved
from its breast in the same manner as from a turkey's.

ROAST FOWL.

1001. Generally speaking, it is not necessary so completely to cut up a fowl as we have described
in the preceding paragraphs, unless, indeed, a large family party is assembled, and there are
a number of "little mouths" to be filled, or some other such circumstances prevail. A roast
fowl is carved in the same manner as a boiled fowl, No. 1000; viz., by cutting along the line
from. 1 to 2, and then round the leg between it and the wing. The markings and detached pieces,
as shown in the engravings under the heading of "Boiled Fowl," supersede the necessity of our
lengthily again describing the operation. It may be added, that the liver, being considered
a delicacy, should be divided, and one half served with each wing. In the case of a fowl being
shifted, it will be proper to give each guest a portion, unless it be not agreeable to some
one of the party.

ROAST GOOSE.

1002. It would not be fair to say that this dish bodes a great deal of happiness to an inexperienced
carver, especially if there is a large party to serve, and the slices off the breast should
not suffice to satisfy the desires and cravings of many wholesome appetites, produced, may
be, by the various sports in vogue at Michaelmas and Christmas. The beginning of the task,
however, is not in any way difficult. Evenly-cut slices, not too thick or too thin, should
be carved from the breast in the direction of the line from 2 to 3; after the first slice has
been cut, a hole should be made with the knife in the part called the apron, passing it round
the line, as indicated by the figures 1, 1, 1: here the stuffing is located, and some of this
should be served on each plate, unless it is discovered that it is not agreeable to the taste
of some one guest. If the carver manages cleverly, he will be able to cut a very large number
of fine slices off the breast, and the more so if he commences close down by the wing, and
carves upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone. As many slices as can be taken from the
breast being carved, the wings should be cut off; and the same process as described in carving
boiled fowl, is made use of in this instance, only more dexterity and greater force will most
probably be required: the shape of the leg, when disengaged from the body of the goose, should
be like that shown in the accompanying engraving. It will be necessary, perhaps, in taking
off the leg, to turn the goose on its side, and then, pressing down the small end of the leg,
the knife should be passed under it from the top quite down to the joint; the leg being now
turned back by the fork, the knife must cut through the joint, loosening the thigh-bone from
its socket. The merrythought, which in a goose is not so large as might be expected, is disengaged
in the same way as that of a fowl--by passing the knife under it, and pressing it backwards
towards the neck. The neck-bones, of which we give a cut, are freed by the same process as
are those of a fowl; and the same may be said of all the other parts of this bird. The breast
of a goose is the part most esteemed; all parts, however, are good, and full of juicy flavour.

PIGEON.

1003. A very straightforward plan is adopted in carving a pigeon: the knife is carried sharply
in the direction of the line as shown from 1 to 2, entirely through the bird, cutting it into
two precisely equal and similar parts. If it is necessary to make three pieces of it, a small
wing should be cut off with the leg on either side, thus serving two guests; and, by this means,
there will be sufficient meat left on the breast to send to the third guest.

RABBITS.

1004. In carving a boiled rabbit, let the knife be drawn on each side of the backbone, the
whole length of the rabbit, as shown by the dotted line 3 to 4: thus the rabbit will be in
three parts. Now let the back be divided into two equal parts in the direction of the line
from 1 to 2; then let the leg be taken off, as shown by the line 5 to 6, and the shoulder,
as shown by the line 7 to 8. This, in our opinion, is the best plan to carve a rabbit, although
there are other modes which are preferred by some.

A roast rabbit is rather differently trussed from one that is meant to be boiled; but the carving
is nearly similar, as will be seen by the cut. The back should be divided into as many pieces
as it will give, and the legs and shoulders can then be disengaged in the same manner as those
of the boiled animal.

ROAST TURKEY.

1005. A noble dish is a turkey, roast or boiled. A Christmas dinner, with the middle classes
of this empire, would scarcely be a Christmas dinner without its turkey; and we can hardly
imagine an object of greater envy than is presented by a respected portly pater-familias carving,
at the season devoted to good cheer and genial charity, his own fat turkey, and carving it
well. The only art consists, as in the carving of a goose, in getting from the breast as many
fine slices as possible; and all must have remarked the very great difference in the large
number of people whom a good carver will find slices for, and the comparatively few that a
bad carver will succeed in serving. As we have stated in both the carving of a duck and goose,
the carver should commence cutting slices close to the wing from, 2 to 3, and then proceed
upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone: this is not the usual plan, but, in practice,
will be found the best. The breast is the only part which is looked on as fine in a turkey,
the legs being very seldom cut off and eaten at table: they are usually removed to the kitchen,
where they are taken off, as here marked, to appear only in a form which seems to have a special
attraction at a bachelor's supper-table,--we mean devilled: served in this way, they are especially
liked and relished.

A boiled turkey is carved in the same manner as when roasted.

CHAPTER XXII.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON GAME.

1006. THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND has a maxim, that goods, in which no person can claim any property,
belong, by his or her prerogative, to the king or queen. Accordingly, those animals, those
ferae naturae, which come under the denomination of game, are, in our laws, styled his or her
majesty's, and may therefore, as a matter of course, be granted by the sovereign to another;
in consequence of which another may prescribe to possess the same within a certain precinct
or lordship. From this circumstance arose the right of lords of manors or others to the game
within their respective liberties; and to protect these species of animals, the game laws were
originated, and still remain in force. There are innumerable acts of parliament inflicting
penalties on persons who may illegally kill game, and some of them are very severe; but they
cannot be said to answer their end, nor can it be expected that they ever will, whilst there
are so many persons of great wealth who have not otherwise the means of procuring game, except
by purchase, and who will have it. These must necessarily encourage poaching, which, to a very
large extent, must continue to render all game laws nugatory as to their intended effects upon
the rustic population.

1007. THE OBJECT OF THESE LAWS, however, is not wholly confined to the restraining of the illegal
sportsman. Even qualified or privileged persons must not kill game at all seasons. During the
day, the hours allowed for sporting are from one hour before sunrise till one hour after sunset;
whilst the time of killing certain species is also restricted to certain seasons. For example,
the season for bustard-shooting is from December 1 to March 1; for grouse, or red grouse, from
August 12 to December 10; heath-fowl, or black-game, from August 20 to December 20; partridges
from September 1 to February 12; pheasants from October 1 to February 1; widgeons, wild ducks,
wild geese, wild fowls, at any time but in June, July, August, and September. Hares may be
killed at any time of the year, under certain restrictions defined by an act of parliament
of the 10th of George III.

1008. THE EXERCISE OR DIVERSION OF PURSUING FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS OF GAME is called hunting, which,
to this day, is followed in the field and the forest, with gun and greyhound. Birds, on the
contrary, are not hunted, but shot in the air, or taken with nets and other devices, which
is called fowling; or they are pursued and taken by birds of prey, which is called hawking,
a species of sport now fallen almost entirely into desuetude in England, although, in some
parts, showing signs of being revived.

1009. IN PURSUING FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS, such as deer, boars, and hares, properly termed hunting,
mankind were, from the earliest ages, engaged. It was the rudest and the most obvious manner
of acquiring human support before the agricultural arts had in any degree advanced. It is an
employment, however, requiring both art and contrivance, as well as a certain fearlessness
of character, combined with the power of considerable physical endurance. Without these, success
could not be very great; but, at best, the occupation is usually accompanied with rude and
turbulent habits; and, when combined with these, it constitutes what is termed the savage state
of man. As culture advances, and as the soil proportionably becomes devoted to the plough or
to the sustenance of the tamer or more domesticated animals, the range of the huntsman is proportionably
limited; so that when a country has attained to a high state of cultivation, hunting becomes
little else than an amusement of the opulent. In the case of fur-bearing animals, however,
it is somewhat different; for these continue to supply the wants of civilization with one of
its most valuable materials of commerce.

1010. THE THEMES WHICH FORM THE MINSTRELSY OF THE EARLIEST AGES, either relate to the spoils
of the chase or the dangers of the battle-field. Even the sacred writings introduce us to Nimrod,
the first mighty hunter before the Lord, and tell us that Ishmael, in the solitudes of Arabia,
became a skilful bow-man; and that David, when yet young, was not afraid to join in combat
with the lion or the bear. The Greek mythology teems with hunting exploits. Hercules overthrows
the Nemaean lion, the Erymanthean boar, and the hydra of Lerna; Diana descends to the earth,
and pursues the stag; whilst Aesculapius, Nestor, Theseus, Ulysses, and Achilles are all followers
of the chase. Aristotle, sage as he was, advises young men to apply themselves early to it;
and Plato finds in it something divine. Horace exalts it as a preparative exercise for the
path of glory, and several of the heroes of Homer are its ardent votaries. The Romans followed
the hunting customs of the Greeks, and the ancient Britons were hunters before Julius Caesar
invaded their shores.

1011. ALTHOUGH THE ANCIENT BRITONS FOLLOWED HUNTING, however, they did not confine themselves
solely to its pursuit. They bred cattle and tilled the ground, and, to some extent, indicated
the rudimentary state of a pastoral and agricultural life; but, in every social change, the
sports of the field maintained their place. After the expulsion of the Danes, and during the
brief restoration of the Saxon monarchy, these were still followed: even Edward the Confessor,
who would join in no other secular amusements, took the greatest delight, says William of Malmesbury,
"to follow a pack of swift hounds in pursuit of game, and to cheer them with his voice."

1012. NOR WAS EDWARD the only English sovereign who delighted in the pleasures of the chase.
William the Norman, and his two sons who succeeded him, were passionately fond of the sport,
and greatly circumscribed the liberties of their subjects in reference to the killing of game.
The privilege of hunting in the royal forests was confined to the king and his favourites;
and in order that these umbrageous retreats might be made more extensive, whole villages were
depopulated, places of worship levelled with the ground, and every means adopted that might
give a sufficient amplitude of space, in accordance with the royal pleasure, for the beasts
of the chase. King John was likewise especially attached to the sports of the field; whilst
Edward III. was so enamoured of the exercise, that even during his absence at the wars in France,
he took with him sixty couples of stag-hounds and as many hare-hounds, and every day amused
himself either with hunting or hawking. Great in wisdom as the Scotch Solomon, James I., conceited
himself to be, he was much addicted to the amusements of hunting, hawking, and shooting. Yea,
it is oven asserted that his precious time was divided between hunting, the bottle, and his
standish: to the first he gave his fair weather, to the second his dull, and to the third his
cloudy. From his days down to the present, the sports of the field have continued to hold their
high reputation, not only for the promotion of health, but for helping to form that manliness
of character which enters so largely into the composition of the sons of the British soil.
That it largely helps to do this there can be no doubt. The late duke of Grafton, when hunting,
was, on one occasion, thrown into a ditch. A young curate, engaged in the same chase, cried
out, "Lie still, my lord!" leapt over him, and pursued his sport. Such an apparent want of
feeling might be expected to have been resented by the duke; but not so. On his being helped
up by his attendant, he said, "That man shall have the first good living that falls to my disposal:
had he stopped to have given me his sympathy, I never would have given him anything." Such
was the manly sentiment of the duke, who delighted in the exemplification of a spirit similarly
ardent as his own in the sport, and above the baseness of an assumed sorrow.

1013. THAT HUNTING HAS IN MANY INSTANCES BEEN CARRIED TO AN EXCESS is well known, and the match
given by the Prince Esterhazy, regent of Hungary, on the signing of the treaty of peace with
France, is not the least extraordinary upon record. On that occasion, there were killed 160
deer, 100 wild boars, 300 hares, and 80 foxes: this was the achievement of one day. Enormous,
however, as this slaughter may appear, it is greatly inferior to that made by the contemporary
king of Naples on a hunting expedition. That sovereign had a larger extent of ground at his
command, and a longer period for the exercise of his talents; consequently, his sport, if it
can so be called, was proportionably greater. It was pursued during his journey to Vienna,
in Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia; when he killed 5 bears, 1,820 boars, 1,950 deer, 1,145 does,
1,625 roebucks, 11,121 rabbits, 13 wolves, 17 badgers, 16,354 hares, and 354 foxes. In birds,
during the same expedition, he killed 15,350 pheasants and 12,335 partridges. Such an amount
of destruction can hardly be called sport; it resembles more the indiscriminate slaughter of
a battle-field, where the scientific engines of civilized warfare are brought to bear upon
defenceless savages.

1014. DEER AND HARES may be esteemed as the only four-footed animals now hunted in Britain
for the table; and even those are not followed with the same ardour as they were wont to be.
Still, there is no country in the world where the sport of hunting on horseback is carried
to such an extent as in Great Britain, and where the pleasures of the chase are so well understood,
and conducted on such purely scientific principles. The Fox, of all "the beasts of the field,"
is now considered to afford the best sport. For this, it is infinitely superior to the stag;
for the real sportsman can only enjoy that chase when the deer is sought for and found like
other game which are pursued with hounds. In the case of finding an outlying fallow-deer, which
is unharboured, in this manner, great sport is frequently obtained; but this is now rarely
to be met with in Britain. In reference to hare-hunting, it is much followed in many parts
of this and the sister island; but, by the true foxhunter, it is considered as a sport only
fit to be pursued by women and old men. Although it is less dangerous and exciting than the
fox-chase, however, it has great charms for those who do not care for the hard riding which
the other requires.

1015. THE ART OF TAKING OR KILLING BIRDS is called "fowling," and is either practised as an
amusement by persons of rank or property, or for a livelihood by persons who use nets and other
apparatus. When practised as an amusement, it principally consists of killing them with a light
firearm called a "fowling-piece," and the sport is secured to those who pursue it by the game
laws. The other means by which birds are taken, consist in imitating their voices, or leading
them, by other artifices, into situations where they become entrapped by nets, birdlime, or
otherwise. For taking large numbers of birds, the pipe or call is the most common means employed;
and this is done during the months of September and October. We will here briefly give a description
of the modus operandi pursued in this sport. A thin wood is usually the spot chosen, and, under
a tree at a little distance from the others, a cabin is erected, and there are only such branches
left on the tree as are necessary for the placing of the birdlime, and which are covered with
it. Around the cabin are placed avenues with twisted perches, also covered with birdlime. Having
thus prepared all that is necessary, the birdcatcher places himself in the cabin, and, at sunrise
and sunset, imitates the cry of a small bird calling the others to its assistance. Supposing
that the cry of the owl is imitated, immediately different kinds of birds will flock together
at the cry of their common enemy, when, at every instant, they will be seen falling to the
ground, their wings being of no use to them, from their having come in contact with the birdlime.
The cries of those which are thus situated now attract others, and thus are large numbers taken
in a short space of time. If owls were themselves desired to be taken, it is only during the
night that this can be done, by counterfeiting the squeak of the mouse. Larks, other birds,
and water-fowl, are sometimes taken by nets; but to describe fully the manner in which this
is done, would here occupy too much space.

1016. FEATHERED GAME HAVE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL given gratification to the palate of man. With
the exception of birds of prey, and some other species, Moses permitted his people to eat them;
and the Egyptians made offerings to their priests of their most delicate birds. The ancient
Greeks commenced their repasts with little roasted birds; and feathered game, amongst the Romans,
was served as the second course. Indeed, several of the ancient gourmands of the "imperial
city" were so fond of game, that they brought themselves to ruin by eating flamingoes and pheasants.
"Some modern nations, the French among others," says Monsieur Soyer, "formerly ate the heron,
crane, crow, stork, swan, cormorant, and bittern. The first three especially were highly esteemed;
and Laillevant, cook of Charles VII., teaches us how to prepare these meagre, tough birds.
Belon says, that in spite of its revolting taste when unaccustomed to it, the bittern is, however,
among the delicious treats of the French. This writer also asserts, that a falcon or a vulture,
either roasted or boiled, is excellent eating; and that if one of these birds happened to kill
itself in flying after game, the falconer instantly cooked it. Lebaut calls the heron a royal
viand."

1017. THE HERON WAS HUNTED BY THE HAWK, and the sport of hawking is usually placed at the head
of those amusements that can only be practised in the country. This precedency it probably
obtained from its being a pastime to generally followed by the nobility, not in Great Britain
only, but likewise on the continent. In former times, persons of high rank rarely appeared
in public without their dogs and their hawks: the latter they carried with them when they journeyed
from one country to another, and sometimes even took them to battle with them, and would not
part with them when taken prisoners, even to obtain their own liberty. Such birds were esteemed
as the ensigns of nobility, and no action was reckoned more dishonourable in a man of rank
than that of giving up his hawk. We have already alluded to the hunting propensities of our
own Edward III., and we may also allude to his being equally addicted to hawking. According
to Froissart, when this sovereign invaded France, he took with him thirty falconers on horseback,
who had charge of his hawks, and every day, as his royal fancy inclined him, he either hunted,
or went to the river for the purpose of hawking. In the great and powerful, the pursuit of
game as a sport is allowable, but in those who have to earn their bread by the sweat of their
brow, it is to be condemned. In Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy" we find a humorous story,
told by Poggius, the Florentine, who reprobates this folly in such persons. It is this. A physician
of Milan, that cured madmen, had a pit of water in his house, in which he kept his patients,
some up to the knees, some to the girdle, some to the chin, pro modo insaniae, as they were
more or less affected. One of them by chance, that was well recovered, stood in the door, and
seeing a gallant pass by with a hawk on his fist, well mounted, with his spaniels after him,
would needs know to what use all this preparation served. He made answer, To kill certain fowl.
The patient demanded again, what his fowl might be worth which he killed in a year? He replied,
Five or ten crowns; and when he urged him further, what his dogs, horse, and hawks stood him
in, he told him four hundred crowns. With that the patient bade him begone, as he loved his
life and welfare; "for if our master come and find thee here, he will put thee in the pit,
amongst the madmen, up to the chin." Thus reproving the madness of such men as will spend themselves
in those vain sports, to the neglect of their business and necessary affairs.

1018. AS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF SOCIAL PROGRESS is, at least to limit, if not entirely to
suppress, such sports as we have here been treating of, much of the romance of country life
has passed away. This is more especially the case with falconry, which had its origin about
the middle of the fourth century, although, lately, some attempts have been rather successfully
made to institute a revival of the "gentle art" of hawking. Julius Firmicus, who lived about
that time, is, so far as we can find, the first Latin author who speaks of falconers, and the
art of teaching one species of birds to fly after and catch others. The occupation of these
functionaries has now, however, all but ceased. New and nobler efforts characterize the aims
of mankind in the development of their civilization, and the sports of the field have, to a
large extent, been superseded by other exercises, it may be less healthful and invigorating,
but certainly more elegant, intellectual, and humanizing.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXIII.

ROAST BLACK-COCK.

1019. INGREDIENTS.--Black-cock, butter, toast.

Mode.--Let these birds hang for a few days, or they will be tough and tasteless, if not well
kept. Pluck and draw them, and wipe the insides and outsides with a damp cloth, as washing
spoils the flavour. Cut off the heads, and truss them, the same as a roast fowl, cutting off
the toes, and scalding and peeling the feet. Trussing them with the head on, as shown in the
engraving, is still practised by many cooks, but the former method is now considered the best.
Put them down to a brisk fire, well baste them with butter, and serve with a piece of toast
under, and a good gravy and bread sauce. After trussing, some cooks cover the breast with vine-leaves
and slices of bacon, and then roast them. They should be served in the same manner and with
the same accompaniments as with the plainly-roasted birds.

Time.--45 to 50 minutes.

Average cost, from 5s. to 6s. the brace; but seldom bought.

Sufficient,--2 or 3 for a dish.

Seasonable from the middle of August to the end of December.

    THE BLACK-COCK, HEATH-COCK, MOOR-FOWL, OR HEATH-POULT.--This
    bird sometimes weighs as much as four pounds, and the hen about
    two. It is at present confined to the more northern parts of
    Britain, culture and extending population having united in
    driving it into more desolate regions, except, perhaps, in a few
    of the more wild and less-frequented portions of England. It may
    still be found in the New Forest, in Hampshire, Dartmoor, and
    Sedgmoor, in Devonshire, and among the hills of Somersetshire,
    contiguous to the latter. It may also be found in Staffordshire,
    in North Wales, and again in the north of England; but nowhere
    so plentiful as in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland. The
    males are hardly distinguishable from the females until they are
    about half-grown, when the black feathers begin to appear, first
    about the sides and breast. Their food consists of the tops of
    birch and heath, except when the mountain berries are ripe, at
    which period they eagerly and even voraciously pick the
    bilberries and cranberries from the bushes. Large numbers of
    these birds are found in Norway, almost rivalling the turkey in
    point of size. Some of them have begun to be imported into
    London, where they are vended in the shops; but the flavour of
    their flesh is not equal to that of the Scotch bird.

HASHED WILD DUCK.

1020. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast wild duck, 1 pint of good brown gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls
of bread crumbs, 1 glass of claret, salt, cayenne, and mixed spices to taste; 1 tablespoonful
of lemon or Seville orange-juice.

Seasonable from November to February.

RAGOUT OF WILD DUCK.

1021. Cut them into joints, reserve the legs, wings, and breasts until wanted; put the trimmings
into a stewpan with the shalots and stock, and let them simmer for about 1/2 hour, and strain
the gravy. Put the butter into a stewpan; when melted, dredge in a little flour, and pour in
the gravy made from the bones; give it one boil, and strain it again; add the wine, lemon-juice,
and cayenne; lay in the pieces of duck, and let the whole gradually warm through, but do not
allow it to boil, or the duck will be hard. The gravy should not be too thick, and should be
very highly seasoned. The squeeze of a Seville orange is a great improvement to this dish.

Time.--About 1/2 hour to make the gravy; 1/4 hour for the duck gradually to warm through.

Seasonable from November to February.

ROAST WILD DUCK.

1022. INGREDIENTS.--Wild duck, flour, butter.

Mode.--Carefully pluck and draw them; Cut off the heads close to the necks, leaving sufficient
skin to turn over, and do not cut off the feet; some twist each leg at the knuckle, and rest
the claws on each side of the breast; others truss them as shown in our Illustration. Roast
the birds before a quick fire, and, when they are first put down, let them remain for 5 minutes
without basting (this will keep the gravy in); afterwards baste plentifully with butter, and
a few minutes before serving dredge them lightly with flour; baste well, and send them to table
nicely frothed, and full of gravy. If overdone, the birds will lose their flavour. Serve with
a good gravy in the dish, or orange gravy, No. 488; and send to table with them a cut lemon.
To take off the fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have, baste them for a few minutes with
hot water to which have been added an onion and a little salt; then take away the pan, and
baste with butter.--See coloured plate, G1.

Time.--When liked underdressed, 20 to 25 minutes; well done, 25 to 35 minutes.

Average cost, 4s. to 5s. the couple.

Sufficient,--2 for a dish.

Seasonable from November to February.

    THE WILD DUCK.--The male of the wild dock is called a mallard;
    and the young ones are called flappers. The time to try to find
    a brood of these is about the month of July, among the rushes of
    the deepest and most retired parts of some brook or stream,
    where, if the old bird is sprung, it may be taken as a certainty
    that its brood is not far off. When once found, flappers are
    easily killed, as they attain their full growth before their
    wings are fledged. Consequently, the sport is more like hunting
    water-rats than shooting birds. When the flappers take wing,
    they assume the name of wild ducks, and about the month of
    August repair to the corn-fields, where they remain until they
    are disturbed by the harvest-people. They then frequent the
    rivers pretty early in the evening, and give excellent sport to
    those who have patience to wait for them. In order to know a
    wild duck, it is necessary only to look at the claws, which
    should be black.

HASHED GAME (Cold Meat Cookery).

1023.

Mode.--Cut the remains of cold game into joints, reserve the best pieces, and the inferior
ones and trimmings put into a stewpan with the onion, pepper, lemon-peel, salt, and water or
weak stock; stew these for about an hour, and strain the gravy; thicken it with butter and
flour; add the wine, lemon-juice, and ketchup; lay in the pieces of game, and let them gradually
warm through by the side of the fire; do not allow it to boil, or the game will be hard. When
on the point of simmering, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread.

Time.--Altogether 1-1/4 hour.

Seasonable from August to March.

Note.--Any kind of game may be hashed by the above recipe, and the flavour may be varied by
adding flavoured vinegars, curvy powder, &c.; but we cannot recommend these latter ingredients,
as a dish of game should really have a gamy taste; and if too many sauces, essences, &c., are
added to the gravy, they quite overpower and destroy the flavour the dish should possess.

GROUSE PIE.

1024. INGREDIENTS.--Grouse; cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste; 1 lb. of rump-steak, 1/2 pint
of well-seasoned broth, puff paste.

Mode.--Line the bottom of a pie-dish with the rump-steak cut into neat pieces, and, should
the grouse be large, cut them into joints; but, if small, they may be laid in the pie whole;
season highly with salt, cayenne, and black pepper; pour in the broth, and cover with a puff
paste; brush the crust over with the yolk of an egg, and bake from 3/4 to 1 hour. If the grouse
is cut into joints, the backbones and trimmings will make the gravy, by stewing them with an
onion, a little sherry, a bunch of herbs, and a blade of mace: this should be poured in after
the pie is baked. 9d.

Seasonable from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.

ROAST GROUSE.

1025. INGREDIENTS.--Grouse, butter, a thick slice of toasted bread.

Mode.--Let the birds hang as long as possible; pluck and draw them; wipe, but do not wash them,
inside and out, and truss them without the head, the same as for a roast fowl. Many persons
still continue to truss them with the head under the wing, but the former is now considered
the most approved method. Put them down to a sharp clear fire; keep them well basted the whole
of the time they are cooking, and serve them on a buttered toast, soaked in the dripping-pan,
with a little melted butter poured over them, or with bread-sauce and gravy.--See coloured
plate, L1.

Time.--1/2 hour; if liked very thoroughly done, 35 minutes.

Average cost, 2s. to 2s. 6d. the brace; but seldom bought.

Sufficient,--2 for a dish.

Seasonable from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.

    GROUSE.--These birds are divided into wood grouse, black grouse,
    red grouse, and white grouse. The wood grouse is further
    distinguished as the cock of the wood, or capercalzie, and is as
    large as the turkey, being about two feet nine inches in length,
    and weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds. The female is
    considerably less than the male, and, in the colour of her
    feathers, differs widely from the other. This beautiful species
    is found principally in lofty, mountainous regions, and is very
    rare in Great Britain; but in the pine forests of Russia,
    Sweden, and other northern countries, it is very common. In
    these it has its habitat, feeding on the cones of the trees, and
    the fruits of various kinds of plants, especially the berry of
    the jumper. Black grouse is also distinguished as black-game, or
    the black-cock. It is not larger than the common hen, and weighs
    only about four pounds. The female is about one-third less than
    the male, and also differs considerably from him in point of
    colour. Like the former, they are found chiefly in high
    situations, and are common in Russia, Siberia, and other
    northern countries. They are also found in the northern parts of
    Great Britain, feeding in winter on the various berries and
    fruits belonging to mountainous countries, and, in summer,
    frequently descending to the lower lands, to feed upon corn. The
    red grouse, gorcock, or moor-cock, weighs about nineteen ounces,
    and the female somewhat less. In the wild heathy tracts of the
    northern counties of England it is plentiful, also in Wales and
    the Highlands of Scotland. Mr. Pennant considered it peculiar to
    Britain, those found in the mountainous parts of Spain, France,
    and Italy, being only varieties of the same bird. White grouse,
    white game, or ptarmigan, is nearly the same size as the red
    grouse, and is found in lofty situations, where it supports
    itself in the severest weather. It is to be met with in most of
    the northern countries of Europe, and appears even in Greenland.
    In the Hebrides, Orkneys, and the Highlands of Scotland, it is
    also found; and sometimes, though rarely, among the fells of
    Northumberland and Cumberland. In winter they fly in flocks, and
    are so little familiar with the sight of man, that they are
    easily shot, and even snared. They feed on the wild produce of
    the hills, which sometimes imparts to their flesh a bitter but
    not unpalatable taste. According to Buffon, it is dark-coloured,
    and somewhat flavoured like the hare.

GROUSE SALAD.

(Soyer's Recipe.)

1026. INGREDIENTS.--8 eggs, butter, fresh salad, 1 or 2 grouse; for the sauce, 1 teaspoonful
of minced shalot, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, the yolk of 1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of minced
parsley, 1/4 oz. of salt, 4 tablespoonfuls of oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of Chili vinegar, 1 gill
of cream.

Mode.--Boil the eggs hard, shell them, throw them into cold water cut a thin slice off the
bottom to facilitate the proper placing of them in the dish, cut each one into four lengthwise,
and make a very thin flat border of butter, about one inch from the edge of the dish the salad
is to be served on; fix the pieces of egg upright close to each other, the yolk outside, or
the yolk and white alternately; lay in the centre a fresh salad of whatever is in season, and,
having previously roasted the grouse rather underdone, cut it into eight or ten pieces, and
prepare the sauce as follows:--Put the shalots into a basin, with the sugar, the yolk of an
egg, the parsley, and salt, and mix in by degrees the oil and vinegar; when these ingredients
are well mixed, put the sauce on ice or in a cool place. When ready to serve, whip the cream
rather thick, which lightly mix with it; then lay the inferior parts of the grouse on the salad,
sauce over so as to cover each piece, then lay over the salad and the remainder of the grouse,
pour the rest of the sauce over, and serve. The eggs may be ornamented with a little dot of
radishes or beetroot on the point. Anchovy and gherkin, cut into small diamonds, may be placed
between, or cut gherkins in slices, and a border of them laid round. Tarragon or chervil-leaves
are also a pretty addition. The remains of cold black-game, pheasant, or partridge may be used
in the above manner, and will make a very delicate dish.

Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Seasonable from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.

    THE CAPERCALZIE.--This bird was to be met with formerly both in
    Ireland and Scotland, but is now extinct. The male lives
    separate from the females, except in the breeding season. Its
    manners and habits are very like those of black grouse, except
    that it seems to be wholly confined to forests of pine, on the
    tender shoots of which it feeds. It is by no means uncommon in
    the woods of Norway, whence we received it. It is also found
    abundant in Russia, Siberia, Italy, and in some portions of the
    Alps. It was, in 1760, last seen in Scotland, in the woods of
    Strathglass. Recent attempts have been made to re-introduce it
    into that country, but without success; principally owing, as we
    should imagine, to the want of sufficient food suitable for its
    sustenance.

    GROUSE.--Under this general term are included several species of
    game birds, called black, red, woodland, and white grouse. The
    black is larger than the red (see No. 1025), and is not so
    common, and therefore held in higher estimation. The red,
    however, is a bird of exquisite flavour, and is a native of the
    mountainous districts of Scotland and the north of England. It
    feeds on the tops of the heath and the berries that grow amongst
    them: its colour is a rich chestnut, striped with black. The
    woodland, or cock of the wood, is the largest among the bird
    tribes which pass under the denomination of game. It is smaller
    than the turkey, and was originally common in our mountains; but
    it is now to be found only in the mountains of Scotland, though
    it still abounds in the north of Europe, Germany, and in the
    Alps. It is esteemed as delicious eating, and its plumage is
    extremely beautiful. The white grouse, or ptarmigan, is not a
    plentiful bird in Britain; but it is still found in the islands,
    and weighs about half a pound. The London market is supplied by
    Norway and Scotland; those from the former country being
    esteemed the best. When young, it is held in high estimation,
    being considered as little different from common grouse.

ROAST HARE.

1027. INGREDIENTS.--Hare, forcemeat No. 417, a little milk, butter.

Choosing and Trussing.--Choose a young hare; which may be known by its smooth and sharp claws,
and by the cleft in the lip not being much spread. To be eaten in perfection, it must hang
for some time; and, if properly taken care of, it may be kept for several days. It is better
to hang without being paunched; but should it be previously emptied, wipe the inside every
day, and sprinkle over it a little pepper and ginger, to prevent the musty taste which long
keeping in the damp occasions, and which also affects the stuffing. After it is skinned, wash
it well, and soak for an hour in warm water to draw out the blood; if old, let it lie in vinegar
for a short time, but wash it well afterwards in several waters. Make a forcemeat by recipe
No. 417, wipe the hare dry, fill the belly with it, and sew it up. Bring the hind and fore
legs close to the body towards the head, run a skewer through each, fix the head between the
shoulders by means of another skewer, and be careful to leave the ears on. Pat a string round
the body from skewer to skewer, and tie it above the back.

Mode.--The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire when it is first laid down, or the
outside will become dry and hard before the inside is done. Baste it well with milk for a short
time, and afterwards with butter; and particular attention must be paid to the basting, so
as to preserve the meat on the back juicy and nutritive. When it is almost roasted enough,
flour the hare, and baste well with butter. When nicely frothed, dish it, remove the skewers,
and send it to table with a little gravy in the dish, and a tureen of the same. Red-currant
jelly must also not be forgotten, as this is an indispensable accompaniment to roast hare.
For economy, good beef dripping may be substituted for the milk and butter to baste with; but
the basting, as we have before stated, must be continued without intermission. If the liver
is good, it maybe parboiled, minced, and mixed with the stuffing; but it should not be used
unless quite fresh.--See coloured plate, E1.

Time.--A middling-sized hare, 1-1/4 hour; a large hare, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

Average cost, from 4s. to 6s.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from September to the end of February.

THE HARE.--This little animal is found generally distributed over Europe, and, indeed, in most
parts of the northern world. Its extreme timidity is the endowment which Providence has bestowed
upon it as a means of defence; it is therefore attentive to every sound, and is supplied with
ears both long and tubular, with which it can hear with great acuteness. Its eyes, also, are
so constructed, and placed so prominent in its head, that it can see both before and behind
it. It lives entirely upon vegetables, but its flesh is considered dry, notwithstanding that
it is deemed, in many respects, superior to that of the rabbit, being more savoury, and of
a much higher flavour. Its general time of feeding is the evening; but during the day, if not
disturbed, it adheres closely to its form.

POTTED HARE (a Luncheon or Breakfast Dish).

1028. INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, a few slices of bacon, a large bunch of savoury herbs, 4 cloves,
1/2 teaspoonful of whole allspice, 2 carrots, 2 onions, salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of
water, 2 glasses of sherry.

Mode.--Skin, empty, and wash the hare; cut it down the middle, and put it into a stewpan, with
a few slices of bacon under and over it; add the remaining ingredients, and stew very gently
until the hare is tender, and the flesh will separate easily from the bones. When done enough,
take it up, remove the bones, and pound the meat, with the bacon, in a mortar, until reduced
to a perfectly smooth paste. Should it not be sufficiently seasoned, add a little cayenne,
salt, and pounded mace, but be careful that these are well mixed with the other ingredients.
Press the meat into potting-pots, pour over clarified butter, and keep in a dry place. The
liquor that the hare was stewed in, should be saved for hashes, soups, &c. &c.

Time.--About 21/2 hours to stew the hare.

Seasonable from September to the end of February.

BROILED HARE (a Supper or Luncheon Dish).

1029. INGREDIENTS.--The leg and shoulders of a roast hare, cayenne and salt to taste, a little
butter.

Mode.--Cut the legs and shoulders of a roast hare, season them highly with salt and cayenne,
and broil them over a very clear fire for 5 minutes. Dish them on a hot dish, rub over them
a little cold butter, and send to table very quickly.

Time.--5 minutes.

Seasonable from September to the end of February.

HASHED HARE.

1030. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast hare, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 or 3 allspice,
pepper and salt to taste, 1 onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of port wine,
thickening of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup. Let the whole gradually
heat by the side of the fire, and, when it has simmered for about 5 minutes, serve, and garnish
the dish with sippets of toasted bread. Send red-currant jelly to table with it.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the cold hare, 6d.

Seasonable from September to the end of February.

JUGGED HARE.

(Very Good.)

1031. INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, 1-1/2 lb. of gravy beef, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1 onion, 1 lemon, 6
cloves; pepper, cayenne, and salt to taste; 1/2 pint of port wine.

Mode.--Skin, paunch, and wash the hare, cut it into pieces, dredge them with flour, and fry
in boiling butter. Have ready 1-1/2 pint of gravy, made from the above proportion of beef,
and thickened with a little flour. Put this into a jar; add the pieces of fried hare, an onion
stuck with six cloves, a lemon peeled and cut in half, and a good seasoning of pepper, cayenne,
and salt; cover the jar down tightly, put it up to the neck into a stewpan of boiling water,
and let it stew until the hare is quite tender, taking care to keep the water boiling. When
nearly done, pour in the wine, and add a few forcemeat balls, made by recipe No. 417: these
must be fried or baked in the oven for a few minutes before they are put to the gravy. Serve
with red-currant jelly.

Time,--3-1/2 to 4 hours. If the hare is very old, allow 4-1/2 hours.

Average cost, 7s.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from September to the end of February.

II.

(A Quicker and more Economical Way.)

1032. INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 onions, each stuck with 3 cloves, 6 whole
allspice, 1/2 teaspoonful of black pepper, a strip of lemon-peel, thickening of butter and
flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 1/4 pint of port wine.

Mode.--Wash the hare nicely, cut it up into joints (not too large), and flour and brown them
as in the preceding recipe; then put them into a stewpan with the herbs, onions, cloves, allspice,
pepper, and lemon-peel; cover with hot water, and when it boils, carefully remove all the scum,
and let it simmer gently till tender, which will be in about 1-3/4 hour, or longer, should
the hare be very old. Take out the pieces of hare, thicken the gravy with flour and butter,
add the ketchup and port wine, let it boil for about 10 minutes, strain it through a sieve
over the hare, and serve. A few fried forcemeat balls should be added at the moment of serving,
or instead of frying them, they may be stewed in the gravy, about 10 minutes before the hare
is wanted for table. Do not omit to serve red-currant jelly with it.

Time.--Altogether 2 hours. Average cost, 5s. 6d.

Note.--Should there be any left, rewarm it the next day by putting the hare, &c. into a covered
jar, and placing this jar in a saucepan of boiling water: this method prevents a great deal
of waste.

ROAST LANDRAIL, OR CORN-CRAKE.

1033. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 birds, butter, fried bread crumbs.

Mode.--Pluck and draw the birds, wipe them inside and out with damp cloths, and truss them
in the following manner:--Bring the head round under the wing, and the thighs close to the
sides; pass a skewer through them and the body, and keep the legs straight. Roast them before
a clear fire, keep them well basted, and serve on fried bread crumbs, with a tureen of brown
gravy. When liked, bread-sauce may also be sent to table with them.

Time.--12 to 20 minutes. Average cost,--Seldom bought.

Sufficient.--Allow--1 for a dish.

Seasonable from August 12th to the middle of September.

    THE LANDRAIL, OR CORN-CRAKE.--This bird is migratory in its
    habits, yet from its formation, it seems ill adapted for long
    aërial passages, its wings being short, and placed so forward
    out of the centre of gravity, that it flies in an extremely
    heavy and embarrassed manner, and with its legs hanging down.
    When it alights, it can hardly be sprung a second time, as it
    runs very fast, and seems to depend for its safety more on the
    swiftness of its feet than the celerity of its wings. It makes
    its appearance in England about the same time as the quail, that
    is, in the months of April and May, and frequents the same
    places. Its singular cry is first heard when the grass becomes
    long enough to shelter it, and it continues to be heard until
    the grass is cut. The bird, however, is seldom seen, for it
    constantly skulks among the thickest portions of the herbage,
    and runs so nimbly through it, doubling and winding in every
    direction, that it is difficult to get near it. It leaves this
    island before the winter, and repairs to other countries in
    search of its food, which principally consists of slugs, large
    numbers of which it destroys. It is very common in Ireland, and,
    whilst migrating to this country, is seen in great numbers in
    the island of Anglesea. On its first arrival in England, it is
    so lean as scarcely to weigh above five or six ounces; before
    its departure, however, it has been known to exceed eight
    ounces, and is then most delicious eating.

TO DRESS A LEVERET.

1034. INGREDIENTS.--2 leverets, butter, flour.

Mode.--Leverets should be trussed in the same manner as a hare, but they do not require stuffing.
Serve with plain gravy in the dish, and send to table red-currant jelly with them.

Time.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. Average cost, in full season, 4s. each.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from May to August, but cheapest in July and August.

BROILED PARTRIDGE (a Luncheon, Breakfast, or Supper Dish).

1035. INGREDIENTS.--3 partridges, salt and cayenne to taste, a small piece of butter, brown
gravy or mushroom sauce.

Mode.--Pluck, draw, and cut the partridges in half, and wipe the inside thoroughly with a damp
cloth. Season them with salt and cayenne, broil them over a very clear fire, and dish them
on a hot dish; rub a small piece of butter over each half, and send them to table with brown
gravy or mushroom sauce.

Time.--About 1/4 hour. Average cost, 1s. 6d. to 2s. a brace.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.

PARTRIDGE PIE.

1036. INGREDIENTS.--3 partridges, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley
(when obtainable, a few mushrooms), 3/4 lb. of veal cutlet, a slice of ham, 1/2 pint of stock,
puff paste.

Mode.--Line a pie-dish with a veal cutlet; over that place a slice of ham and a seasoning of
pepper and salt. Pluck, draw, and wipe the partridges; cut off the legs at the first joint,
and season them inside with pepper, salt, minced parsley, and a small piece of butter; place
them in the dish, and pour over the stock; line the edges of the dish with puff paste, cover
with the same, brush it over with the yolk of an egg, and bake for 3/4 to 1 hour.

Seasonable from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.

Note.--Should the partridges be very large, split them in half; they will then lie in the dish
more compactly. When at hand, a few mushrooms should always be added.

POTTED PARTRIDGE.

1037. INGREDIENTS.--Partridges; seasoning to taste of mace, allspice white pepper, and salt;
butter, coarse paste.

Mode.--Pluck and draw the birds, and wipe them inside with a damp cloth. Pound well some mace,
allspice, white pepper, and salt; mix together, and rub every part of the partridges with this.
Pack the birds as closely as possible in a baking-pan, with plenty of butter over them, and
cover with a coarse flour and water crust. Tie a paper over this, and bake for rather more
than 1-1/2 hour; let the birds get cold, then cut them into pieces for keeping, pack them closely
into a large potting-pot, and cover with clarified butter. This should be kept in a cool dry
place. The butter used for potted things will answer for basting, or for paste for meat pies.--See
coloured plate, D1.

Time.--1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.

SALMI DE PERDRIX, or HASHED PARTRIDGES.

1038. INGREDIENTS.--3 young partridges, 3 shalots, a slice of lean ham, 1 carrot, 3 or 4 mushrooms,
a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 cloves, 6 whole peppers, 3/4 pint of stock, 1 glass of sherry or
Madeira, a small lump of sugar.

Mode.--After the partridges are plucked and drawn, roast them rather underdone, and cover them
with paper, as they should not be browned; cut them into joints, take off the skin from the
wings, legs, and breasts; put these into a stewpan, cover them up, and set by until the gravy
is ready. The remains of roast partridge answer very well dressed in this way, although not
so good as when the birds are in the first instance only half-roasted. This recipe is equally
suitable for pheasants, moor-game, &c.; but care must be taken always to skin the joints.

Time.--Altogether 1 hour.

Sufficient.--2 or 3 partridges for an entrée.

Seasonable from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.

ROAST PARTRIDGE.

1039. INGREDIENTS.--Partridge; butter.

Choosing and Trussing.--Choose young birds, with dark-coloured bills and yellowish legs, and
let them hang a few days, or there will be no flavour to the flesh, nor will it be tender.
The time they should be kept, entirely depends on the taste of those for whom they are intended,
as what some persons would consider delicious, would be to others disgusting and offensive.
They may be trussed with or without the head, the latter mode being now considered the most
fashionable. Pluck, draw, and wipe the partridge carefully inside and out; cut off the head,
leaving sufficient skin on the neck to skewer back; bring the legs close to the breast, between
it and the side-bones, and pass a skewer through the pinions and the thick part of the thighs.
When the head is left on, it should be brought round and fixed on to the point of the skewer.

Mode.--When the bird is firmly and plumply trussed, roast it before a nice bright fire; keep
it well basted, and a few minutes before serving, flour and froth it well. Dish it, and serve
with gravy and bread sauce, and send to table hot and quickly. A little of the gravy should
be poured over the bird.--See coloured plate, D1.

Time.--25 to 35 minutes. Average cost, is 1s. 6d. to 2s. a brace.

Sufficient,--2 for a dish.

Seasonable from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.

    THE PARTRIDGE.--This bird is to be found in nearly all the
    temperate countries of Europe, but is most abundant in the
    Ukraine, although it is unable to bear the extremes of climate,
    whether hot or cold. It was formerly very common in France, and
    is considered a table luxury in England. The instinct of this
    bird is frequently exemplified in a remarkable manner, for the
    preservation of its young. "I have seen it often," says a very
    celebrated writer, and an accurate observer of nature, "and once
    in particular, I saw an extraordinary instance of an old bird's
    solicitude to save its brood. As I was hunting with a young
    pointer, the dog ran on a brood of very small partridges; the
    old bird cried, fluttered, and ran tumbling along just before
    the dog's nose, till she had drawn him to a considerable
    distance, when she took wing, and flew still further off, but
    not out of the field; on this the dog returned to me, near the
    place where the young ones lay concealed in the grass, which the
    old bird no sooner perceived than she flew back to us, settled
    just before the dog's nose again, and by rolling and tumbling
    about, drew off his attention from her young, and thus preserved
    her brood a second time. I have also seen, when a kite has been
    hovering over a covey of young partridges, the old birds fly up
    at the bird of prey, screaming and fighting with all their might
    to preserve their brood." Partridges should be chosen young; if
    old, they are valueless. The young ones are generally known by
    their yellow legs and dark-coloured bills.

PHEASANT CUTLETS.

1040. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 pheasants, egg and bread crumbs, cayenne and salt to taste, brown gravy.

Mode.--Procure 3 young pheasants that have been hung a few days; pluck, draw, and wipe them
inside; cut them into joints; remove the bones from the best of these; and the backbones, trimmings,
&c., put into a stewpan, with a little stock, herbs, vegetables, seasoning, &c., to make the
gravy. Flatten and trim the cutlets of a good shape, egg and bread crumb them, broil them over
a clear fire, pile them high in the dish, and pour under them the gravy made from the bones,
which should be strained, flavoured, and thickened. One of the small bones should be stuck
on the point of each cutlet.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, 2s. 6d. to 3s. each.

Sufficient for 2 entrées.

Seasonable from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.

ROAST PHEASANT.

1041. INGREDIENTS.--Pheasant, flour, butter.

Choosing and Trussing.--Old pheasants may be known by the length and sharpness of their spurs;
in young ones they are short and blunt. The cock bird is generally reckoned the best, except
when the hen is with egg. They should hang some time before they are dressed, as, if they are
cooked fresh, the flesh will be exceedingly dry and tasteless. After the bird is plucked and
drawn, wipe the inside with a damp cloth, and truss it in the same manner as partridge, No.
1039. If the head is left on, as shown in the engraving, bring it round under the wing, and
fix it on to the point of the skewer.

Mode.--Roast it before a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and flour and froth it nicely. Serve
with brown gravy, a little of which should be poured round the bird, and a tureen of bread
sauce. 2 or 3 of the pheasant's best tail-feathers are sometimes stuck in the tail as an ornament;
but the fashion is not much to be commended.--See coloured plate, F1. 6d. to 3s. each. Sufficient,--1
for a dish.

Seasonable from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.

    THE PHEASANT.--This beautiful bird is said to have been
    discovered by the Argonauts on the banks of the Phasis, near
    Mount Ararat, in their expedition to Colchis. It is common,
    however, in almost all the southern parts of the European
    continent, and has been long naturalized in the warmest and most
    woody counties of England. It is very common in France; indeed,
    so common as to be esteemed a nuisance by the farmers. Although
    it has been domesticated, this is not easily accomplished, nor
    is its flesh so palatable then as it is in the wild state. Mr.
    Ude says--"It is not often that pheasants are met with
    possessing that exquisite taste which is acquired only by long
    keeping, as the damp of this climate prevents their being kept
    as long as they are in other countries. The hens, in general,
    are the most delicate. The cocks show their age by their spurs.
    They are only fit to be eaten when the blood begins to run from
    the bill, which is commonly six days or a week after they have
    been killed. The flesh is white, tender, and has a good flavour,
    if you keep it long enough; if not, it is not much different
    from that of a common fowl or hen."

BRILLAT SAVARIN'S RECIPE FOR ROAST PHEASANT, a la Sainte Alliance.

1042. When the pheasant is in good condition to be cooked (see No. 1041), it should be plucked,
and not before. The bird should then be stuffed in the following manner:--Take two snipes,
and draw them, putting the bodies on one plate, and the livers, &c., on another. Take off the
flesh, and mince it finely with a little beef, lard, a few truffles, pepper and salt to taste,
and stuff the pheasant carefully with this. Cut a slice of bread, larger considerably than
the bird, and cover it with the liver, &c., and a few truffles: an anchovy and a little fresh
butter added to these will do no harm. Put the bread, &c., into the dripping-pan, and, when
the bird is roasted, place it on the preparation, and surround it with Florida oranges.

Do not be uneasy, Savarin adds, about your dinner; for a pheasant served in this way is fit
for beings better than men. The pheasant itself is a very good bird; and, imbibing the dressing
and the flavour of the truffle and snipe, it becomes thrice better.

BROILED PHEASANT (a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish).

1043. INGREDIENTS.--1 pheasant, a little lard, egg and bread crumbs, salt and cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Cut the legs off at the first joint, and the remainder of the bird into neat pieces;
put them into a fryingpan with a little lard, and when browned on both sides, and about half
done, take them out and drain them; brush the pieces over with egg, and sprinkle with bread
crumbs with which has been mixed a good seasoning of cayenne and salt. Broil them over a moderate
fire for about 10 minutes, or rather longer, and serve with mushroom-sauce, sauce piquante,
or brown gravy, in which a few game-bones and trimmings have been stewed.

Time.--Altogether 1/2 hour. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.

    THE HEIGHT OF EXCELLENCE IN A PHEASANT.--Things edible have
    their degrees of excellence under various circumstances: thus,
    asparagus, capers, peas, and partridges are best when young.
    Perfection in others is only reached when they attain maturity:
    let us say, for example, melons and nearly all fruits (we must
    except, perhaps, the medlar), with the majority of those animals
    whose flesh we eat. But others, again, are not good until
    decomposition is about to set in; and here we may mention
    particularly the snipe and the pheasant. If the latter bird be
    eaten so soon as three days after it has been killed, it then
    has no peculiarity of flavour; a pullet would be more relished,
    and a quail would surpass it in aroma. Kept, however, a proper
    length of time,--and this can be ascertained by a slight smell
    and change of colour,--then it becomes a highly, flavoured dish,
    occupying, so to speak, the middle distance between chicken and
    venison. It is difficult to define any exact time to "hang" a
    pheasant; but any one possessed of the instincts of
    gastronomical science, can at once detect the right moment when
    a pheasant should be taken down, in the same way as a good cook
    knows whether a bird should be removed from the spit, or have a
    turn or two more.

TO DRESS PLOVERS.

1044. INGREDIENTS.--3 plovers, butter, flour, toasted bread.

Choosing and Trussing.--Choose those that feel hard at the vent, as that shows their fatness.
There are three sorts,--the grey, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. They will keep good
for some time, but if very stale, the feet will be very dry. Plovers are scarcely fit for anything
but roasting; they are, however, sometimes stewed, or made into a ragoût, but this mode of
cooking is not to be recommended.

Mode.--Pluck off the feathers, wipe the outside of the birds with a damp cloth, and do not
draw them; truss with the head under the wing, put them down to a clear fire, and lay slices
of moistened toast in the dripping-pan, to catch the trail. Keep them well basted, dredge them
lightly with flour a few minutes before they are done, and let them be nicely frothed. Dish
them on the toasts, over which the trail should be equally spread. Pour round the toast a little
good gravy, and send some to table in a tureen.

Time.--10 minutes to 1/4 hour.

Average cost, 1s. 6d. the brace, if plentiful.

Sufficient for 2 persons.

Seasonable.--In perfection from the beginning of September to the end of January.

    THE PLOVER.--There are two species of this bird, the grey and
    the green, the former being larger than the other, and somewhat
    less than the woodcock. It has generally been classed with those
    birds which chiefly live in the water; but it would seem only to
    seek its food there, for many of the species breed upon the
    loftiest mountains. Immense flights of these birds are to be
    seen in the Hebrides, and other parts of Scotland; and, in the
    winter, large numbers are sent to the London market, which is
    sometimes so much glutted with them that they are sold very
    cheap. Previous to dressing, they are kept till they have a game
    flavour; and although their flesh is a favourite with many, it
    is not universally relished. The green is preferred to the grey,
    but both are inferior to the woodcock. Their eggs are esteemed
    as a great delicacy. Birds of this kind are migratory. They
    arrive in England in April, live with us all the spring and
    summer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by
    getting together in flocks. It is supposed that they then retire
    to Spain, and frequent the sheep-walks with which that country
    abounds.

TO DRESS THE PTARMIGAN.

1045. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 birds; butter, flour, fried bread crumbs.

Mode.--The ptarmigan, or white grouse, when young and tender, are exceedingly fine eating,
and should be kept as long as possible, to be good. Pluck, draw, and truss them in the same
manner as grouse, No. 1025, and roast them before a brisk fire. Flour and froth them nicely,
and serve on buttered toast, with a tureen of brown gravy. Bread sauce, when liked, may be
sent to table with them, and fried bread crumbs substituted for the toasted bread.

Time.--About 1/2 hour. Sufficient,--2 for a dish.

Seasonable from the beginning of February to the end of April.

    THE PTARMIGAN, OR WHITE GROUSE.--This bird is nearly the same
    size as red grouse, and is fond of lofty situations, where it
    braves the severest weather, and is found in most parts of
    Europe, as well as in Greenland. At Hudson's Bay they appear in
    such multitudes that so many as sixty or seventy are frequently
    taken at once in a net. As they are as tame as chickens, this is
    done without difficulty. Buffon says that the Ptarmigan avoids
    the solar heat, and prefers the frosts of the summits of the
    mountains; for, as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains,
    it ascends till it gains the top, where it makes a hole, and
    burrows in the snow. In winter, it flies in flocks, and feeds on
    the wild vegetation of the hills, which imparts to its flesh a
    bitter, but not altogether an unpalatable taste. It is
    dark-coloured, and has something of the flavour of the hare, and
    is greatly relished, and much sought after by some sportsmen.

TO DRESS QUAILS.

1046. INGREDIENTS.--Quails, butter, toast.

Mode.--These birds keep good several days, and should be roasted without drawing. Truss them
in the same manner as woodcocks, No. 1062; roast them before a clear fire, keep them well basted,
and serve on toast.

Time.--About 20 minutes. Average cost.--Seldom bought.

Sufficient 2 for a dish.

Seasonable from October to December.

    THE QUAIL.--Quails are almost universally diffused over Europe,
    Asia, and Africa. Being birds of passage, they are seen in
    immense flocks, traversing the Mediterranean Sea from Europe to
    Africa, in the autumn, and returning again in the spring,
    frequently alighting in their passage on many of the islands of
    the Archipelago, which, with their vast numbers, they almost
    completely cover. On the western coasts of the kingdom of
    Naples, they have appeared in such prodigious numbers, that,
    within the compass of four or five miles, as many as a hundred
    thousand have been taken in a day. "From these circumstances,"
    says a writer on natural history, "it appears highly probable
    that the quails which supplied the Israelites with food during
    their journey through the wilderness, were sent thither, on
    their passage to the north, by a wind from the south-west,
    sweeping over Egypt and Ethiopia towards the shores of the Red
    Sea." In England they are not very numerous, although they breed
    in it; and many of them are said to remain throughout the year,
    changing their quarters from the interior parts of the country
    for the seacoast.

TO DRESS SNIPES.

1047. INGREDIENTS.--Snipes, butter, flour, toast.

Mode.--These, like woodcocks, should be dressed without being drawn. Pluck, and wipe them outside,
and truss them with the head under the wing, having previously skinned that and the neck. Twist
the legs at the first joint, press the feet upon the thighs, and pass a skewer through these
and the body. Place four on a skewer, tie them on to the jack or spit, and roast before a clear
fire for about 1/4 hour. Put some pieces of buttered toast into the dripping-pan to catch the
trails; flour and froth the birds nicely, dish the pieces of toast with the snipes on them,
and pour round, but not over them, a little good brown gravy. They should be sent to table
very hot and expeditiously, or they will not be worth eating.--See coloured plate M1.

Seasonable from November to February.

Note.--Ortolans are trussed and dressed in the same manner.

    THE SNIPE.--This is a migratory bird, and is generally
    distributed over Europe. It is found in most parts of England,
    in the high as well as the low lands, depending much on the
    weather. In very wet seasons it resorts to the hills, but at
    other times frequents marshes, where it can penetrate the earth
    with its bill, hunting for worms, which form its principal food.
    In the Hebrides and the Orkneys snipes are plentiful, and they
    are fattest in frosty weather. In the breeding season the snipe
    changes its note entirely from that which it has in the winter.
    The male will keep on wing for an hour together, mounting like a
    lark, and uttering a shrill piping noise; then, with a bleating
    sound, not unlike that made by an old goat, it will descend with
    great velocity, especially if the female be sitting in her nest,
    from which it will not wander far.

ROAST TEAL.

1048. INGREDIENTS.--Teal, butter, a little flour.

Mode.--Choose fat plump birds, after the frost has set in, as they are generally better flavoured;
truss them in the same manner as wild duck, No. 1022; roast them before a brisk fire, and keep
them well basted. Serve with brown or orange gravy, water-cresses, and a cut lemon. The remains
of teal make excellent hash.

Time.--From 9 to 15 minutes.

Average cost, 1s. each; but seldom bought.

Sufficient,--2 for a dish.

Seasonable from October to February.

ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON.

1049. INGREDIENTS.--Venison, coarse flour-and-water paste, a little flour.

Mode.--Choose a haunch with clear, bright, and thick fat, and the cleft of the hoof smooth
and close; the greater quantity of fat there is, the better quality will the meat be. As many
people object to venison when it has too much haut goût, ascertain how long it has been kept,
by running a sharp skewer into the meat close to the bone; when this is withdrawn, its sweetness
can be judged of. With care and attention, it will keep good a fortnight, unless the weather
is very mild. Keep it perfectly dry by wiping it with clean cloths till not the least damp
remains, and sprinkle over powdered ginger or pepper, as a preventative against the fly. When
required for use, wash it in warm water, and dry it well with a cloth; butter a sheet of white
paper, put it over the fat, lay a coarse paste, about 1/2 inch in thickness, over this, and
then a sheet or two of strong paper. Tie the whole firmly on to the haunch with twine, and
put the joint down to a strong close fire; baste the venison immediately, to prevent the paper
and string from burning, and continue this operation, without intermission, the whole of the
time it is cooking. About 20 minutes before it is done, carefully remove the paste and paper,
dredge the joint with flour, and baste well with butter until it is nicely frothed, and of
a nice pale-brown colour; garnish the knuckle-bone with a frill of white paper, and serve with
a good, strong, but unflavoured gravy, in a tureen, and currant jelly; or melt the jelly with
a little port wine, and serve that also in a tureen. As the principal object in roasting venison
is to preserve the fat, the above is the best mode of doing so where expense is not objected
to; but, in ordinary cases, the paste may be dispensed with, and a double paper placed over
the roast instead: it will not require so long cooking without the paste. Do not omit to send
very hot plates to table, as the venison fat so soon freezes: to be thoroughly enjoyed by epicures,
it should be eaten on hot-water plates. The neck and shoulder may be roasted in the same manner.

Time.--A large haunch of buck venison, with the paste, 4 to 5 hours; haunch of doe venison,
3-1/4 to 3-3/4 hours. Allow less time without the paste.

Average cost, 1s. 4d. to 1s. 6d. per lb.

Sufficient for 18 persons.

Seasonable.--Buck venison in greatest perfection from June to Michaelmas; doe venison from
November to the end of January.

    THE DEER.--This active tribe of animals principally inhabit wild
    and woody regions. In their contentions, both with each other
    and the rest of the brute creation, these animals not only use
    their horns, but strike very furiously with their fore feet.
    Some of the species are employed as beasts of draught, whilst
    the flesh of the whole is wholesome, and that of some of the
    kinds, under the name of "venison," is considered very
    delicious. Persons fond of hunting have invented peculiar terms
    by which the objects of their pursuit are characterized: thus
    the stag is called, the first year, a calf, or hind-calf;
    the second, a knobber; the third, a brock; the fourth, a
    staggard; the fifth, a stag; and the sixth, a hart. The
    female is, the first year, called a calf; the second, a
    hearse; and the third, a hind. In Britain, the stag has
    become scarcer than it formerly was; but, in the Highlands of
    Scotland, herds of four or five hundred may still be seen,
    ranging over the vast mountains of the north; and some of the
    stags of a great size. In former times, the great feudal
    chieftains used to hunt with all the pomp of eastern sovereigns,
    assembling some thousands of their clans, who drove the deer
    into the toils, or to such stations as were occupied by their
    chiefs. As this sport, however, was occasionally used as a means
    for collecting their vassals together for the purpose of
    concocting rebellion, an act was passed prohibitory of such
    assemblages. In the "Waverley" of Sir Walter Scott, a
    deer-hunting scene of this kind is admirably described.

    VENISON.--This is the name given to the flesh of some kinds of
    deer, and is esteemed as very delicious. Different species of
    deer are found in warm as well as cold climates, and are in
    several instances invaluable to man. This is especially the case
    with the Laplander, whose reindeer constitutes a large
    proportion of his wealth. There--

      "The reindeer unharness'd in freedom can play,
      And safely o'er Odin's steep precipice stray,
      Whilst the wolf to the forest recesses may fly,
      And howl to the moon as she glides through the sky."

    In that country it is the substitute for the horse, the cow, the
    goat, and the sheep. From its milk is produced cheese; from its
    skin, clothing; from its tendons, bowstrings and thread; from
    its horns, glue; from its bones, spoons; and its flesh furnishes
    food. In England we have the stag, an animal of great beauty,
    and much admired. He is a native of many parts of Europe, and is
    supposed to have been originally introduced into this country
    from France. About a century back he was to be found wild in
    some of the rough and mountainous parts of Wales, as well as in
    the forests of Exmoor, in Devonshire, and the woods on the banks
    of the Tamar. In the middle ages the deer formed food for the
    not over abstemious monks, as represented by Friar Tuck's
    larder, in the admirable fiction of "Ivanhoe;" and at a later
    period it was a deer-stealing adventure that drove the
    "ingenious" William Shakspeare to London, to become a common
    player, and the greatest dramatist that ever lived.

HASHED VENISON.

1050. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of roast venison, its own or mutton gravy, thickening of butter
and flour.

Mode.--Cut the meat from the bones in neat slices, and, if there is sufficient of its own gravy
left, put the meat into this, as it is preferable to any other. Should there not be enough,
put the bones and trimmings into a stewpan, with about a pint of mutton gravy; let them stew
gently for an hour, and strain the gravy. Put a little flour and butter into the stewpan, keep
stirring until brown, then add the strained gravy, and give it a boil up; skim and strain again,
and, when a little cool, put in the slices of venison. Place the stewpan by the side of the
fire, and, when on the point of simmering, serve: do not allow it to boil, or the meat will
be hard. Send red-currant jelly to table with it.

Time.--Altogether, 1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable.--Buck venison, from June to Michaelmas; doe venison, from November to the end of
January.

Note.--A small quantity of Harvey's sauce, ketchup, or port wine, may be added to enrich the
gravy: these ingredients must, however, be used very sparingly, or they will overpower the
flavour of the venison.

    THE FALLOW-DEER.--This is the domestic or park deer; and no two
    animals can make a nearer approach to each other than the stag
    and it, and yet no two animals keep more distinct, or avoid each
    other with a more inveterate animosity. They never herd or
    intermix together, and consequently never give rise to an
    intermediate race; it is even rare, unless they have been
    transported thither, to find fellow-deer in a country where
    stags are numerous. He is very easily tamed, and feeds upon many
    things which the stag refuses: he also browzes closer than the
    stag, and preserves his venison better. The doe produces one
    fawn, sometimes two, but rarely three. In short, they resemble
    the stag in all his natural habits, and the greatest difference
    between them is the duration of their lives: the stag, it is
    said, lives to the age of thirty-five or forty years, and the
    fallow-deer does not live more than twenty. As they are smaller
    than the stag, it is probable that their growth is sooner
    completed.

STEWED VENISON.

1051. INGREDIENTS.--A shoulder of venison, a few slices of mutton fat, 2 glasses of port wine,
pepper and allspice to taste, 1-1/2 pint of weak stock or gravy, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole pepper,
1/2 teaspoonful of whole allspice.

Mode.--Hang the venison till tender; take out the bone, flatten the meat with a rolling-pin,
and place over it a few slices of mutton fat, which have been previously soaked for 2 or 3
hours in port wine; sprinkle these with a little fine allspice and pepper, roll the meat up,
and bind and tie it securely. Put it into a stewpan with the bone and the above proportion
of weak stock or gravy, whole allspice, black pepper, and port wine; cover the lid down closely,
and simmer, very gently, from 3-1/2 to 4 hours. When quite tender, take off the tape, and dish
the meat; strain the gravy over it, and send it to table with red-currant jelly. Unless the
joint is very fat, the above is the best mode of cooking it.

Time.--3-1/2 to 4 hours.

    THE ROEBUCK.--This is the Certuscapreolus, or common roe, and
    is of a reddish-brown colour. It is an inhabitant of Asia, as
    well as of Europe. It has great grace in its movements, and
    stands about two feet seven inches high, and has a length of
    about three feet nine. The extent of its horns is from six to
    eight inches.

    THE STAG.--The stag, or hart, is the male of the red deer, and
    the hind is the female. He is much larger than the fallow-deer,
    and his age is indicated by his horns, which are round instead
    of being palmated, like those of the fallow-deer. During the
    first year he has no horns, but a horny excrescence, which is
    short and rough, and covered with a thin hairy skin. The next
    year, the horns are single and straight; and in the third they
    have two antlers, three the fourth, four the fifth, and five the
    sixth year; although this number is not always certain, for
    sometimes they are more, and often less. After the sixth year,
    the antlers do not always increase; and, although in number they
    may amount to six or seven on each side, yet the animal's age is
    then estimated rather by the size of the antlers and the
    thickness of the branch which sustains them, than by their
    variety. Large as these horns seem, however, they are shed every
    year, and their place supplied by new ones. This usually takes
    place in the spring. When the old horns have fallen off, the new
    ones do not make their appearance immediately; but the bones of
    the skull ore seen covered with a transparent periosteum, or
    skin, which enwraps the bones of all animals. After a short
    time, however, the skin begins to swell, and to form a sort of
    tumour. From this, by-and-by, rising from the head, shoot forth
    the antlers from each side; and, in a short time, in proportion
    as the animal is in condition, the entire horns are completed.
    The solidity of the extremities, however, is not perfect until
    the horns have arrived at their full growth. Old stags usually
    shed their horns first, which generally happens towards the
    latter end of February or the beginning of March. Such as are
    between five and six years old shed them about the middle or
    latter end of March; those still younger in the month of April;
    and the youngest of all not till the middle or latter end of
    May. These rules, though generally true, are subject to
    variations; for a severe winter will retard the shedding of the
    horns.--The HIND has no horns, and is less fitted for being
    hunted than the male. She takes the greatest care of her young,
    and secretes them in the most obscure thickets, lest they become
    a prey to their numerous enemies. All the rapacious family of
    the cat kind, with the wolf, the dog, the eagle, and the falcon,
    are continually endeavouring to find her retreat, whilst the
    stag himself is the foe of his own offspring. When she has
    young, therefore, it would seem that the courage of the male is
    transferred to the female, for she defends them with the most
    resolute bravery. If pursued by the hunter, she will fly before
    the hounds for half the day, and then return to her young, whose
    life she has thus preserved at the hazard of her own.

    THE NEW VENISON.--The deer population of our splendid English
    parks was, until a few years since, limited to two species, the
    fallow and the red. But as the fallow-deer itself was an
    acclimated animal, of comparatively recent introduction, it came
    to be a question why might not the proprietor of any deer-park
    in England have the luxury of at least half a dozen species of
    deer and antelopes, to adorn the hills, dales, ferny brakes, and
    rich pastures of his domain? The temperate regions of the whole
    world might be made to yield specimens of the noble ruminant,
    valuable either for their individual beauty, or for their
    availability to gastronomic purposes.

    During the last four or live years a few spirited English
    noblemen have made the experiment of breeding foreign deer in
    their parks, and have obtained such a decided success, that it
    may be hoped their example will induce others to follow in a
    course which will eventually give to England's rural scenery a
    new element of beauty, and to English tables a fresh viand of
    the choicest character.

    A practical solution of this interesting question was made by
    Viscount Hill, at Hawkestone Park, Salop, in January, 1809. On
    that occasion a magnificent eland, an acclimated scion of the
    species whose native home is the South African wilderness, was
    killed for the table. The noble beast was thus described:--"He
    weighed 1,176 lbs. as he dropped; huge as a short-horn, but with
    bone not half the size; active as a deer, stately in all his
    paces, perfect in form, bright in colour, with a vast dewlap,
    and strong sculptured horn. This eland in his lifetime strode
    majestic on the hill-side, where he dwelt with his mates and
    their progeny, all English-born, like himself." Three pairs of
    the same species of deer were left to roam at large on the
    picturesque elopes throughout the day, and to return to their
    home at pleasure. "Here, during winter, they are assisted with
    roots and hay, but in summer they have nothing but the pasture
    of the park; so that, in point of expense, they cost no more
    than cattle of the best description." Travellers and sportsmen
    say that the male eland is unapproached in the quality of his
    flesh by any ruminant in South Africa; that it grows to an
    enormous size, and lays on fat with as great facility as a true
    short-horn; while in texture and flavour it is infinitely
    superior. The lean is remarkably fine, the fat firm and
    delicate. It was tried in every fashion,--braised brisket,
    roasted ribs, broiled steaks, filet sauté, boiled aitchbone,
    &c.,--and in all, gave evidence of the fact, that a new meat of
    surpassing value had been added to the products of the English
    park.

    When we hear such a gratifying account of the eland, it is
    pleasing to record that Lord Hastings has a herd of the Canadian
    wapiti, a herd of Indian nylghaus, and another of the small
    Indian hog-deer; that the Earl of Ducie has been successful in
    breeding the magnificent Persian deer. The eland was first
    acclimated in England by the late Earl of Derby, between the
    years 1835-1851, at his menagerie at Knowsley. On his death, in
    1851, he bequeathed to the Zoological Society his breed of
    elands, consisting of two males and three females. Here the
    animals have been treated with the greatest success, and from
    the year 1853 to the present time, the females have regularly
    reproduced, without the loss of a single calf.

ROAST WIDGEON.

1052. INGREDIENTS.--Widgeons, a little flour, butter.

Mode.--These are trussed in the same manner as wild duck, No. 1022, but must not be kept so
long before they are dressed. Put them down to a brisk fire; flour, and baste them continually
with butter, and, when browned and nicely frothed, send them to table hot and quickly. Serve
with brown gravy, or orange gravy, No. 488, and a cut lemon.

1053. INGREDIENTS.--Woodcocks; butter, flour, toast.

Mode.--Woodcocks should not be drawn, as the trails are, by epicures, considered a great delicacy.
Pluck, and wipe them well outside; truss them with the legs close to the body, and the feet
pressing upon the thighs; skin the neck and head, and bring the beak round under the wing.
Place some slices of toast in the dripping-pan to catch the trails, allowing a piece of toast
for each bird. Roast before a clear fire from 15 to 25 minutes; keep them well basted, and
flour and froth them nicely. When done, dish the pieces of toast with the birds upon them,
and pour round a very little gravy; send some more to table in a tureen. These are most delicious
birds when well cooked, but they should not be kept too long: when the feathers drop, or easily
come out, they are fit for table.--See coloured plate, I 1.

    THE WOODCOCK.--This bird being migratory in its habits, has,
    consequently, no settled habitation; it cannot be considered as
    the property of any one, and is, therefore, not game by law. It
    breeds in high northern latitudes, and the time of its
    appearance and disappearance in Sweden coincides exactly with
    that of its arrival in and return from Great Britain. On the
    coast of Suffolk its vernal and autumnal visits have been
    accurately observed. In the first week of October it makes its
    appearance in small numbers, but in November and December it
    appears in larger numbers, and always after sunset, and most
    gregariously. In the same manner as woodcocks take their leave
    of us, they quit France, Germany, and Italy, making the northern
    and colder climates their summer rendezvous. They visit Burgundy
    in the latter part of October, but continue there only a few
    weeks, the country being hard, and unable to supply them with
    such sustenance as they require. In the winter, they are found
    as far south as Smyrna and Aleppo, and, during the same season,
    in Barbary, where the Africans name them "the ass of the
    partridge." It has been asserted that they have been seen as far
    south as Egypt, which is the most remote region to which they
    can be traced on that side of the eastern world; on the other
    side, they are common in Japan. Those which resort to the
    countries of the Levant are supposed to come from the mountains
    of Armenia, or the deserts of Tartary or Siberia. The flesh of
    the woodcock is held in high estimation; hence the bird is
    eagerly sought after by the sportsman.

GAME CARVING.

BLACKCOCK.

1054. Skilful carving of game undoubtedly adds to the pleasure of the guests at a dinner-table;
for game seems pre-eminently to be composed of such delicate limbs and tender flesh that an
inapt practitioner appears to more disadvantage when mauling these pretty and favourite dishes,
than larger and more robust pièces de résistance. As described at recipe No. 1019, this bird
is variously served with or without the head on; and although we do not personally object to
the appearance of the head as shown in the woodcut, yet it seems to be more in vogue to serve
it without. The carving is not difficult, but should be elegantly and deftly done. Slices from
the breast, cut in the direction of the dotted line from 2 to 1, should be taken off, the merrythought
displaced and the leg and wing removed by running the knife along from 3 to 4, and following
the directions given under the head of boiled fowl, No. 1000, reserving the thigh, which is
considered a great delicacy, for the most honoured guests, some of whom may also esteem the
brains of this bird.

WILD DUCK.

1055. As game is almost universally served as a dainty, and not as a dish to stand the assaults
of an altogether fresh appetite, these dishes are not usually cut up entirely, but only those
parts are served of each, which are considered the best-flavoured and the primest. Of wild-fowl,
the breast alone is considered by epicures worth eating, and slices are cut from this, in the
direction indicated by the lines, from 1 to 2; if necessary, the leg and wing can be taken
off by passing the knife from 3 to 4, and by generally following the directions described for
carving boiled fowl, No. 1000.

ROAST HARE.

1056. The "Grand Carver" of olden times, a functionary of no ordinary dignity, was pleased
when he had a hare to manipulate, for his skill and grace had an opportunity of display. Diners
à la Russe may possibly, erewhile, save modern gentlemen the necessity of learning the art
which was in auld lang syne one of the necessary accomplishments of the youthful squire; but,
until side-tables become universal, or till we see the office of "grand carver" once more instituted,
it will be well for all to learn how to assist at the carving of this dish, which, if not the
most elegant in appearance, is a very general favourite. The hare, having its head to the left,
as shown in the woodcut, should be first served by cutting slices from each side of the backbone,
in the direction of the lines from 3 to 4. After these prime parts are disposed of, the leg
should next be disengaged by cutting round the line indicated by the figures 5 to 6. The shoulders
will then be taken off by passing the knife round from 7 to 8. The back of the hare should
now be divided by cutting quite through its spine, as shown by the line 1 to 2, taking care
to feel with the point of the knife for a joint where the back may be readily penetrated. It
is the usual plan not to serve any bone in helping hare; and thus the flesh should be sliced
from the legs and placed alone on the plate. In large establishments, and where men-cooks are
kept, it is often the case that the backbone of the hare, especially in old animals, is taken
out, and then the process of carving is, of course, considerably facilitated. A great point
to be remembered in connection with carving hare is, that plenty of gravy should accompany
each helping; otherwise this dish, which is naturally dry, will lose half its flavour, and
so become a failure. Stuffing is also served with it; and the ears, which should be nicely
crisp, and the brains of the hare, are esteemed as delicacies by many connoisseurs.

PARTRIDGES.

1057. There are several ways of carving this most familiar game bird. The more usual and summary
mode is to carry the knife sharply along the top of the breastbone of the bird, and cut it
quite through, thus dividing it into two precisely equal and similar parts, in the same manner
as carving a pigeon, No. 1003. Another plan is to cut it into three pieces; viz., by severing
a small wing and leg on either side from the body, by following the line 1 to 2 in the upper
woodcut; thus making 2 helpings, when the breast will remain for a third plate. The most elegant
manner is that of thrusting back the body from the legs, and then cutting through the breast
in the direction shown by the line 1 to 2: this plan will give 4 or more small helpings. A
little bread-sauce should be served to each guest.

GROUSE.

1058. GROUSE may be carved in the way first described in carving partridge. The backbone of
the grouse is highly esteemed by many, and this part of many game birds is considered the finest
flavoured.

PHEASANT.

1059. Fixing the fork in the breast, let the carver cut slices from it in the direction of
the lines from 2 to 1: these are the prime pieces. If there be more guests to satisfy than
these slices will serve, then let the legs and wings be disengaged in the same manner as described
in carving boiled fowl, No. 1000, the point where the wing joins the neckbone being carefully
found. The merrythought will come off in the same way as that of a fowl. The most valued parts
are the same as those which are most considered in a fowl.

SNIPE.

1060. One of these small but delicious birds may be given, whole, to a gentleman; but, in helping
a lady, it will be better to cut them quite through the centre, from 1 to 2, completely dividing
them into equal and like portions, and put only one half on the plate.

HAUNCH OF VENISON.

1061. Here is a grand dish for a knight of the carving-knife to exercise his skill upon, and,
what will be pleasant for many to know, there is but little difficulty in the performance.
An incision being made completely down to the bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2, the
gravy will then be able easily to flow; when slices, not too thick, should be cut along the
haunch, as indicated by the line 4 to 3; that end of the joint marked 3 having been turned
towards the carver, so that he may have a more complete command over the joint. Although some
epicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to others, yet we doubt
if there is any difference between the slices cut above and below the line. It should be borne
in mind to serve each guest with a portion of fat; and the most expeditious carver will be
the best carver, as, like mutton, venison soon begins to chill, when it loses much of its charm.

WOODCOCK.

1062. This bird, like a partridge, may be carved by cutting it exactly into two like portions,
or made into three helpings, as described in carving partridge (No. 1057). The backbone is
considered the tit-bit of a woodcock, and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy.
This bird is served in the manner advised by Brillat Savarin, in connection with the pheasant,
viz., on toast which has received its drippings whilst roasting; and a piece of this toast
should invariably accompany each plate.

LANDRAIL.

1063. LANDRAIL, being trussed like Snipe, with the exception of its being drawn, may be carved
in the same manner.--See No. 1060.

PTARMIGAN.

1064. PTARMIGAN, being of much the same size, and trussed in the same manner, as the red-bird,
may be carved in the manner described in Partridge and Grouse carving, Nos. 1057 and 1058.

QUAILS.

1065. QUAILS, being trussed and served like Woodcock, may be similarly carved.--See No. 1062.

PLOVERS.

1066. PLOVERS may be carved like Quails or Woodcock, being trussed and served in the same way
as those birds.--See No. 1055.

TEAL.

1067. TEAL, being of the same character as Widgeon and Wild Duck, may be treated, in carving,
in the same style.

WIDGEON.

1068. WIDGEON may be carved in the same way as described in regard to Wild Duck, at No. 1055.

CHAPTER XXIV.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON VEGETABLES.

    "Strange there should be found
  Who, self-imprison'd in their proud saloons,
  Renounce the odours of the open field
  For the unscented fictions of the loom;
  Who, satisfied with only pencilled scenes,
  Prefer to the performance of a God,
  Th' inferior wonders of an artist's hand!
  Lovely, indeed, the mimic works of art,
  But Nature's works far lovelier."--COWPER.

1069. "THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS," says Hogg, in his Natural History of the Vegetable
Kingdom, "may be aptly compared to the primary colours of the prismatic spectrum, which are
so gradually and intimately blended, that we fail to discover where the one terminates and
where the other begins. If we had to deal with yellow and blue only, the eye would easily distinguish
the one from the other; but when the two are blended, and form green, we cannot tell where
the blue ends and the yellow begins. And so it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. If
our powers of observation were limited to the highest orders of animals and plants, if there
were only mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, and insects in the one, and trees, shrubs, and
herbs in the other, we should then be able with facility to define the bounds of the two kingdoms;
but as we descend the scale of each, and arrive at the lowest forms of animals and plants,
we there meet with bodies of the simplest structure, sometimes a mere cell, whose organization,
modes of development and reproduction, are so anomalous, and partake so much of the character
of both, that we cannot distinguish whether they are plants or whether they are animals."

1070. WHILST IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE where the animal begins and the vegetable ends, it
is as difficult to account for many of the singularities by which numbers of plants are characterized.
This, however, can hardly be regarded as a matter of surprise, when we recollect that, so far
as it is at present known, the vegetable kingdom is composed of upwards of 92,000 species of
plants. Of this amazing number the lichens and the mosses are of the simplest and hardiest
kinds. These, indeed, may be considered as the very creators of the soil: they thrive in the
coldest and most sterile regions, many of them commencing the operations of nature in the growth
of vegetables on the barest rocks, and receiving no other nourishment than such as may be supplied
to them by the simple elements of air and rain. When they have exhausted their period in such
situations as have been assigned them, they pass into a state of decay, and become changed
into a very fine mould, which, in the active spontaneity of nature, immediately begins to produce
other species, which in their turn become food for various mosses, and also rot. This process
of growth and decay, being, from time to time, continued, by-and-by forms a soil sufficient
for the maintenance of larger plants, which also die and decay, and so increase the soil, until
it becomes deep enough to sustain an oak, or even the weight of a tropical forest. To create
soil amongst rocks, however, must not be considered as the only end of the lichen; different
kinds of it minister to the elegant arts, in the form of beautiful dyes; thus the lichen rocella
is used to communicate to silk and wool, various shades of purple and crimson, which greatly
enhance the value of these materials. This species is chiefly imported from the Canary Islands,
and, when scarce, as an article of commerce has brought as much as £1000 per ton.

1071. IN THE VICINITY OF LICHENS, THE MUSCI, OR MOSSES, are generally to be found. Indeed,
wherever vegetation can be sustained, there they are, affording protection to the roots and
seeds of more delicate vegetables, and, by their spongy texture, retaining a moisture which
preserves other plants from the withering drought of summer. But even in winter we find them
enlivening, by their verdure, the cold bosom of Nature. We see them abounding in our pastures
and our woods, attaching themselves to the living, and still more abundantly to the dead, trunks
and branches of trees. In marshy places they also abound, and become the medium of their conversion
into fruitful fields. This is exemplified by the manner in which peat-mosses are formed: on
the surface of these we find them in a state of great life and vigour; immediately below we
discover them, more or less, in a state of decomposition; and, still deeper, we find their
stems and branches consolidated into a light brown peat. Thus are extensive tracts formed,
ultimately to be brought into a state of cultivation, and rendered subservient to the wants of man.

1072. WHEN NATURE HAS FOUND A SOIL, her next care is to perfect the growth of her seeds, and
then to disperse them. Whilst the seed remains confined in its capsule, it cannot answer its
purpose; hence, when it is sufficiently ripe, the pericardium opens, and lets it out. What
must strike every observer with surprise is, how nuts and shells, which we can hardly crack
with our teeth, or even with a hammer, will divide of themselves, and make way for the little
tender sprout which proceeds from the kernel. There are instances, it is said, such as in the
Touch-me-not (impatiens), and the Cuckoo-flower (cardamine), in which the seed-vessels, by
an elastic jerk at the moment of their explosion, cast the seeds to a distance. We are all
aware, however, that many seeds--those of the most composite flowers, as of the thistle and
dandelion--are endowed with, what have not been inappropriately called, wings. These consist
of a beautiful silk-looking down, by which they are enabled to float in the air, and to be
transported, sometimes, to considerable distances from the parent plant that produced them.
The swelling of this downy tuft within the seed-vessel is the means by which the seed is enabled
to overcome the resistance of its coats, and to force for itself a passage by which it escapes
from its little prison-house.

1073. BIRDS, AS WELL AS QUADRUPEDS, are likewise the means of dispersing the seeds of plants,
and placing them in situations where they ultimately grow. Amongst the latter is the squirrel,
which is an extensive planter of oaks; nay, it may be regarded as having, in some measure,
been one of the creators of the British navy. We have read of a gentleman who was walking one
day in some woods belonging to the Duke of Beaufort, near Troy House, in Monmouthshire, when
his attention was arrested by a squirrel, sitting very composedly upon the ground. He stopped
to observe its motions, when, in a short time, the little animal suddenly quitted its position,
and darted to the top of the tree beneath which it had been sitting. In an instant it returned
with an acorn in its mouth, and with its paws began to burrow in the earth. After digging a
small hole, it therein deposited an acorn, which it hastily covered, and then darted up the
tree again. In a moment it was down with another, which it buried in the same manner; and so
continued its labour, gathering and burying, as long as the gentleman had patience to watch
it. This industry in the squirrel is an instinct which directs it to lay up a store of provision
for the winter; and as it is probable that its memory is not sufficiently retentive to enable
it to recollect all the spots in which it deposits its acorns, it no doubt makes some slips
in the course of the season, and loses some of them. These few spring up, and are, in time,
destined to supply the place of the parent tree. Thus may the sons of Britain, in some degree,
consider themselves to be indebted to the industry and defective memory of this little animal
for the production of some of those "wooden walls" which have, for centuries, been the national
pride, and which have so long "braved the battle and the breeze" on the broad bosom of the
great deep, in every quarter of the civilized globe. As with the squirrel, so with jays and
pies, which plant among the grass and moss, horse-beans, and probably forget where they have
secreted them. Mr. White, the naturalist, says, that both horse-beans and peas sprang up in
his field-walks in the autumn; and he attributes the sowing of them to birds. Bees, he also
observes, are much the best setters of cucumbers. If they do not happen to take kindly to the
frames, the best way is to tempt them by a little honey put on the male and female bloom. When
they are once induced to haunt the frames, they set all the fruit, and will hover with impatience
round the lights in a morning till the glasses are opened.

1074. Some of the acorns planted by the squirrel of Monmouthshire may be now in a fair way
to become, at the end of some centuries, venerable trees; for not the least remarkable quality
of oaks is the strong principle of life with which they are endued. In Major Rooke's "Sketch
of the forest of Sherwood" we find it stated that, on some timber cut down in Berkland and
Bilhaugh, letters were found stamped in the bodies of the trees, denoting the king's reign
in which they were marked. The bark appears to have been cut off, and then the letters to have
been cut in, and the next year's wood to have grown over them without adhering to where the
bark had been cut out. The ciphers were found to be of James I., William and Mary, and one
of King John. One of the ciphers of James was about one foot within the tree, and one foot
from the centre. It was cut down in 1786. The tree must have been two feet in diameter, or
two yards in circumference, when the mark was cut. A tree of this size is generally estimated
at 120 years' growth; which number being subtracted from the middle year of the reign of James,
would carry the year back to 1492, which would be about the period of its being planted. The
tree with the cipher of William and Mary displayed its mark about nine inches within the tree,
and three feet three inches from the centre. This tree was felled in 1786. The cipher of John
was eighteen inches within the tree, and rather more than a foot from the centre. The middle
year of the reign of that monarch was 1207. By subtracting from this 120, the number of years
requisite for a tree's growth to arrive at the diameter of two feet, the date of its being
planted would seem to have been 1085, or about twenty years after the Conquest.

1075. Considering the great endurance of these trees, we are necessarily led to inquire into
the means by which they are enabled to arrive at such strength and maturity; and whether it
may be considered as a humiliation we will not determine, but, with all the ingenious mechanical
contrivances of man, we are still unable to define the limits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
"Plants have been described by naturalists, who would determine the limits of the two kingdoms,
as organized living bodies, without volition or locomotion, destitute of a mouth or intestinal
cavity, which, when detached from their place of growth, die, and, in decay, ferment, but do
not putrefy, and which, on being subjected to analysis, furnish an excess of carbon and no
nitrogen. The powers of chemistry, and of the microscope, however, instead of confirming these
views, tend more and more to show that a still closer affinity exists between plants and animals;
for it is now ascertained that nitrogen, which was believed to be present only in animals,
enters largely into the composition of plants also. When the microscope is brought to aid our
powers of observation, we find that there are organized bodies belonging to the vegetable kingdom
which possess very evident powers of locomotion, and which change about in so very remarkable
a manner, that no other cause than that of volition can be assigned to it." Thus it would seem
that, in this particular at least, some vegetables bear a very close resemblance to animal
life; and when we consider the manner in which they are supplied with nourishment, and perform
the functions of their existence, the resemblance would seem still closer. If, for example,
we take a thin transverse slice of the stem of any plant, or a slice cut across its stem, and
immerse it in a little pure water, and place it under a microscope, we will find that it consists
principally of cells, more or less regular, and resembling those of a honeycomb or a network
of cobweb. The size of these varies in different plants, as it does in different parts of the
same plant, and they are sometimes so minute as to require a million to cover a square inch
of surface. This singular structure, besides containing water and air, is the repository or
storehouse of various secretions. Through it, the sap, when produced, is diffused sideways
through the plant, and by it numerous changes are effected in the juices which fill its cells.
The forms of the cells are various; they are also subject to various transformations. Sometimes
a number of cylindrical cells are laid end to end, and, by the absorption of the transverse
partitions, form a continuous tube, as in the sap-vessels of plants, or in muscular and nervous
fibre; and when cells are thus woven together, they are called cellular tissue, which, in the
human body, forms a fine net-like membrane, enveloping or connecting most of its structures.
In pulpy fruits, the cells may be easily separated one from the other; and within the cells
are smaller cells, commonly known as pulp. Among the cell-contents of some plants are beautiful
crystals, called raphides. The term is derived from [Greek: rhaphis] a needle, on account of
the resemblance of the crystal to a needle. They are composed of the phosphate and oxalate
of lime; but there is great difference of opinion as to their use in the economy of the plant,
and one of the French philosophers endeavoured to prove that crystals are the possible transition
of the inorganic to organic matter. The differences, however, between the highest form of crystal
and the lowest form of organic life known, viz., a simple reproductive cell, are so manifold
and striking, that the attempt to make crystals the bridge over which inorganic matter passes
into organic, is almost totally regarded as futile. In a layer of an onion, a fig, a section
of garden rhubarb, in some species of aloe, in the bark of many trees, and in portions of the
cuticle of the medicinal squill, bundles of these needle-shaped crystals are to be found. Some
of them are as large as 1-40th of an inch, others are as small as the 1-1000th. They are found
in all parts of the plant,--in the stem, bark, leaves, stipules, petals, fruit, roots, and
even in the pollen, with some few exceptions, and they are always situated in the interior
of cells. Some plants, as many of the cactus tribe, are made up almost entirely of these needle-crystals;
in some instances, every cell of the cuticle contains a stellate mass of crystals; in others,
the whole interior is full of them, rendering the plant so exceedingly brittle, that the least
touch will occasion a fracture; so much so, that some specimens of Cactus senilis, said to
be a thousand years old, which were sent a few years since to Kew, from South America, were
obliged to be packed in cotton, with all the care of the most delicate jewellery, to preserve
them during transport.

1076. Besides the cellular tissue, there is what is called a vascular system, which consists
of another set of small vessels. If, for example, we, early in the spring, cut a branch transversely,
we will perceive the sap oozing out from numerous points over the whole of the divided surface,
except on that part occupied by the pith and the bark; and if a twig, on which the leaves are
already unfolded, be cut from the tree, and placed with its cut end in a watery solution of
Brazil-wood, the colouring matter will be found to ascend into the leaves and to the top of
the twig. In both these cases, a close examination with a powerful microscope, will discover
the sap perspiring from the divided portion of the stem, and the colouring matter rising through
real tubes to the top of the twig: these are the sap or conducting vessels of the plant. If,
however, we examine a transverse section of the vine, or of any other tree, at a later period
of the season, we find that the wood is apparently dry, whilst the bark, particularly that
part next the wood, is swelled with fluid. This is contained in vessels of a different kind
from those in which the sap rises. They are found in the bark only in trees, and may be called
returning vessels, from their carrying the sap downwards after its preparation in the leaf.
It is believed that the passage of the sap in plants is conducted in a manner precisely similar
to that of the blood in man, from the regular contraction and expansion of the vessels; but,
on account of their extreme minuteness, it is almost an impossibility to be certain upon this
point. Numerous observations made with the microscope show that their diameter seldom exceeds
a 290th part of a line, or a 3,000th part of an inch. Leuwenhoeck reckoned 20,000 vessels in
a morsel of oak about one nineteenth of an inch square.

1077. In the vascular system of a plant, we at once see the great analogy which it bears to
the veins and arteries in the human system; but neither it, nor the cellular tissue combined,
is all that is required to perfect the production of a vegetable. There is, besides, a tracheal
system, which is composed of very minute elastic spiral tubes, designed for the purpose of
conveying air both to and from the plant. There are also fibres, which consist of collections
of these cells and vessels closely united together. These form the root and the stem. If we
attempt to cut them transversely, we meet with difficulty, because we have to force our way
across the tubes, and break them; but if we slit the wood lengthwise, the vessels are separated
without breaking. The layers of wood, which appear in the stem or branch of a tree cut transversely,
consist of different zones of fibres, each the produce of one year's growth, and separated
by a coat of cellular tissue, without which they could not be well distinguished. Besides all
these, there is the cuticle, which extends over every part of the plant, and covers the bark
with three distinct coats. The liber, or inner bark, is said to be formed of hollow tubes,
which convey the sap downwards to increase the solid diameter of the tree.

1078. THE ROOT AND THE STEM NOW DEMAND A SLIGHT NOTICE. The former is designed, not only to
support the plant by fixing it in the soil, but also to fulfil the functions of a channel for
the conveyance of nourishment: it is therefore furnished with pores, or spongioles, as they
are called, from their resemblance to a sponge, to suck up whatever comes within its reach.
It is found in a variety of forms, and hence its adaptation to a great diversity of soils and
circumstances. We have heard of a willow-tree being dug up and its head planted where its roots
were, and these suffered to spread out in the air like naked branches. In course of time, the
roots became branches, and the branches roots, or rather, roots rose from the branches beneath
the ground, and branches shot from the roots above. Some roots last one year, others two, and
others, like the shrubs and trees which they produce, have an indefinite period of existence;
but they all consist of a collection of fibres, composed of vascular and cellular tissue, without
tracheae, or breathing-vessels. The stem is the grand distributor of the nourishment taken
up by the roots, to the several parts of the plant. The seat of its vitality is said to be
in the point or spot called the neck, which separates the stem from the root. If the root of
a young plant be cut off, it will shoot out afresh; if even the stem be taken away, it will
be renewed; but if this part be injured, the plant will assuredly die.

1079. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN OF THIS WORK, special notices of culinary vegetables will
accompany the various recipes in which they are spoken of; but here we cannot resist the opportunity
of declaring it as our conviction, that he or she who introduces a useful or an ornamental
plant into our island, ought justly to be considered, to a large extent, a benefactor to the
country. No one can calculate the benefits which may spring from this very vegetable, after
its qualities have become thoroughly known. If viewed in no other light, it is pleasing to
consider it as bestowing upon us a share of the blessings of other climates, and enabling us
to participate in the luxury which a more genial sun has produced.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXV.

BOILED ARTICHOKES.

1080. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, a piece
of soda the size of a shilling; artichokes.

Mode.--Wash the artichokes well in several waters; see that no insects remain about them, and
trim away the leaves at the bottom. Cut off the stems and put them into boiling water, to which
have been added salt and soda in the above proportion. Keep the saucepan uncovered, and let
them boil quickly until tender; ascertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them, or
by trying if the leaves can be easily removed. Take them out, let them drain for a minute or
two, and serve in a napkin, or with a little white sauce poured over. A tureen of melted butter
should accompany them. This vegetable, unlike any other, is considered better for being gathered
two or three days; but they must be well soaked and washed previous to dressing.

Time.--20 to 25 minutes, after the water boils.

Sufficient,--a dish of 5 or 6 for 4 persons.

Seasonable from July to the beginning of September.

    THE COMPOSITAE, OR COMPOSITE FLOWERS.--This family is so
    extensive, as to contain nearly a twelfth part of the whole of
    the vegetable kingdom. It embraces about 9,000 species,
    distributed over almost every country; and new discoveries are
    constantly being made and added to the number. Towards the poles
    their numbers diminish, and slightly, also, towards the equator;
    but they abound in the tropical and sub-tropical islands, and in
    the tracts of continent not far from the sea-shore. Among
    esculent vegetables, the Lettuce, Salsify, Scorzonera, Cardoon,
    and Artichoke belong to the family.

FRIED ARTICHOKES.

(Entremets, or Small Dish, to be served with the Second Course.)

1081. INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 artichokes, salt and water: for the batter,--1/4 lb. of flour, a
little salt, the yolk of 1 egg, milk.

Mode.--Trim and boil the artichokes by recipe No. 1080, and rub them over with lemon-juice,
to keep them white. When they are quite tender, take them up, remove the chokes, and divide
the bottoms; dip each piece into batter, fry them in hot lard or dripping, and garnish the
dish with crisped parsley. Serve with plain melted butter.

Time.--20 minutes to boil the artichokes, 5 to 7 minutes to fry them.

Sufficient,--5 or 6 for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from July to the beginning of September.

A FRENCH MODE OF COOKING ARTICHOKES.

1082.

Mode.--Cut the ends of the leaves, as also the stems; put the artichokes into boiling water,
with the above proportion of salt, pepper, herbs, and butter; let them boil quickly until tender,
keeping the lid of the saucepan off, and when the leaves come out easily, they are cooked enough.
To keep them a beautiful green, put a large piece of cinder into a muslin bag, and let it boil
with them. Serve with plain melted butter.

Time.--20 to 25 minutes.

Sufficient,--5 or 6 sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from July to the beginning of September.

ARTICHOKES A L'ITALIENNE.

1083. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 6 artichokes, salt and butter, about 1/2 pint of good gravy.

Mode.--Trim and cut the artichokes into quarters, and boil them until tender in water mixed
with a little salt and butter. When done, drain them well, and lay them all round the dish,
with the leaves outside. Have ready some good gravy, highly flavoured with mushrooms; reduce
it until quite thick, and pour it round the artichokes, and serve.

Time.--20 to 25 minutes to boil the artichokes.

Sufficient for one side-dish.

Seasonable from July to the beginning of September.

    CONSTITUENT PROPERTIES OF THE ARTICHOKE.--According to the
    analysis of Braconnet, the constituent elements of an artichoke
    are,--starch 30, albumen 10, uncrystallizable sugar 148, gum 12,
    fixed oil 1, woody fibre 12, inorganic matter 27, and water 770.

BOILED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES.

1084. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; artichokes.

Mode.--Wash, peel, and shape the artichokes in a round or oval form, and put them into a saucepan
with sufficient cold water to cover them, salted in the above proportion. Let them boil gently
until tender; take them up, drain them, and serve them in a napkin, or plain, whichever mode
is preferred; send to table with them a tureen of melted butter or cream sauce, a little of
which may be poured over the artichokes when they are not served in a napkin.

Time.--About 20 minutes after the water boils.

Average cost, 2d. per lb.

Sufficient,--10 for a dish for 6 persons.

Seasonable from September to June.

    USES OF THE JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE.--This being a tuberous-rooted
    plant, with leafy stems from four to six feet high, it is
    alleged that its tops will afford as much fodder per acre as a
    crop of oats, or more, and its roots half as many tubers as an
    ordinary crop of potatoes. The tubers, being abundant in the
    market-gardens, are to be had at little more than the price of
    potatoes. The fibres of the stems may be separated by
    maceration, and manufactured into cordage or cloth; and this is
    said to be done in some parts of the north and west of France,
    as about Hagenau, where this plant, on the poor sandy soils, is
    an object of field culture.

MASHED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES.

1085. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1 gallon of water allow 1 oz. of salt; 15 or 16 artichokes, 1 oz.
butter, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Boil the artichokes as in the preceding recipe until tender; drain and press the water
from them, and beat them up with a fork. When thoroughly mashed and free from lumps, put them
into a saucepan with the butter and a seasoning of white pepper and salt; keep stirring over
the fire until the artichokes are quite hot, and serve.

Time.--About 20 minutes. Average cost, 2d. per lb.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable from September to June.

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH WHITE SAUCE.

(Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course as a Side-dish.)

1086. INGREDIENTS.--12 to 15 artichokes, 12 to 15 Brussels sprouts, 1/2 pint of white sauce,
No. 538.

Mode.--Peel and cut the artichokes in the shape of a pear; cut a piece
off the bottom of each, that they may stand upright in the dish, and
boil them in salt and water until tender. Have ready 1/2 pint of white
sauce, made by recipe No. 538; dish the artichokes, pour over them the
sauce, and place between each a fine Brussels sprout: these should be
boiled separately, and not with the artichokes. By many it is much esteemed as an
    esculent, when cooked in various ways; and the domesticated
    animals eat both the fresh foliage, and the tubers with great
    relish. By some, they are not only considered nourishing, but
    even fattening.

BOILED ASPARAGUS.

1087.

Mode.--Asparagus should be dressed as soon as possible after it is cut, although it may be
kept for a day or two by putting the stalks into cold water; yet, to be good, like every other
vegetable, it cannot be cooked too fresh. Scrape the white part of the stems, beginning from
the head, and throw them into cold water; then tie them into bundles of about 20 each, keeping
the heads all one way, and cut the stalks evenly, that they may all be the same length; put
them into boiling water, with salt in the above proportion; keep them boiling quickly until
tender, with the saucepan uncovered. When the asparagus is done, dish it upon toast, which
should be dipped in the water it was cooked in, and leave the white ends outwards each war,
with the points meeting in the middle. Serve with a tureen of melted butter.

Time.--15 to 18 minutes after the water boils.

Average cost, in full season, 2s. 6d. the 100 heads.

Sufficient.--Allow about 50 heads for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable.--May be had, forced, from January but cheapest in May, June, and July.

    ASPARAGUS.--This plant belongs to the variously-featured family
    of the order Liliaceae, which, in the temperate regions of
    both hemispheres, are most abundant, and, between the tropics,
    gigantic in size and arborescent in form. Asparagus is a native
    of Great Britain, and is found on various parts of the seacoast,
    and in the fens of Lincolnshire. At Kynarve Cove, in Cornwall,
    there is an island called "Asparagus Island," from the abundance
    in which it is there found. The uses to which the young shoots
    are applied, and the manure in which they are cultivated in
    order to bring them to the highest state of excellence, have
    been a study with many kitchen-gardeners.

ASPARAGUS PEAS.

(Entremets, or to be served as a Side-dish with the Second Course.)

1088. INGREDIENTS.--100 heads of asparagus, 2 oz. of butter, a small bunch of parsley, 2 or
3 green onions, flour, 1 lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, salt.

Mode.--Carefully scrape the asparagus, cut it into pieces of an equal size, avoiding that which
is in the least hard or tough, and throw them into cold water. Then boil the asparagus in salt
and water until three-parts done; take it out, drain, and place it on a cloth to dry the moisture
away from it. Put it into a stewpan with the butter, parsley, and onions, and shake over a
brisk fire for 10 minutes. Dredge in a little flour, add the sugar, and moisten with boiling
water. When boiled a short time and reduced, take out the parsley and onions, thicken with
the yolks of 2 eggs beaten with the cream; add a seasoning of salt, and, when the whole is
on the point of simmering, serve. Make the sauce sufficiently thick to adhere to the vegetable.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. Average cost, 1s. 6d. a pint.

Seasonable in May, June, and July.

    MEDICINAL USES OF ASPARAGUS.--This plant not only acts as a
    wholesome and nutritious vegetable, but also as a diuretic,
    aperient, and deobstruent. The chemical analysis of its juice
    discovers its composition to be a peculiar crystallizable
    principle, called asparagin, albumen, mannite, malic acid, and
    some salts. Thours says, the cellular tissue contains a
    substance similar to sage. The berries are capable of undergoing
    vinous fermentation, and affording alcohol by distillation. In
    their unripe state they possess the same properties as the
    roots, and probably in a much higher degree.

ASPARAGUS PUDDING.

(A delicious Dish, to be served with the Second Course.)

1089. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of asparagus peas, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 tablespoonful
of very finely minced ham, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, milk.

Mode.--Cut up the nice green tender parts of asparagus, about the size of peas; put them into
a basin with the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the flour, ham, butter, pepper, and
salt. Mix all these ingredients well together, and moisten with sufficient milk to make the
pudding of the consistency of thick batter; put it into a pint buttered mould, tie it down
tightly with a floured cloth, place it in boiling water, and let it boil for 2 hours; turn
it out of the mould on to a hot dish, and pour plain melted butter round, but not over, the
pudding. Green peas pudding may be made in exactly the same manner, substituting peas for the
asparagus.

Time.--2 hours.

BOILED FRENCH BEANS.

1090.

Mode.--This vegetable should always be eaten young, as, when allowed to grow too long, it tastes
stringy and tough when cooked. Cut off the heads and tails, and a thin strip on each side of
the beans, to remove the strings. Then divide each bean into 4 or 6 pieces, according to size,
cutting them lengthways in a slanting direction, and, as they are cut, put them into cold water,
with a small quantity of salt dissolved in it. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, with
salt and soda in the above proportion; put in the beans, keep them boiling quickly, with the
lid uncovered, and be careful that they do not get smoked. When tender, which may be ascertained
by their sinking to the bottom of the saucepan, take them up, throw them into a colander; and
when drained, dish and serve with plain melted butter. When very young, beans are sometimes
served whole: when they are thus dressed, their colour and flavour are much better preserved;
but the more general way of dressing them is to cut them into thin strips.

Time.--Very young beans, 10 to 12 minutes; moderate size, 15 to 20 minutes, after the water boils.

Average cost, in full season, 1s. 4d. a peck; but, when forced, very expensive.

Sufficient.--Allow 1/2 peck for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of September; but may be had, forced, from February
to the beginning of June.

FRENCH MODE OF COOKING FRENCH BEANS.

1091. INGREDIENTS.--A quart of French beans, 3 oz. of fresh butter, pepper and salt to taste,
the juice of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Cut and boil the beans by the preceding recipe, and when tender, put them into a stewpan,
and shake over the fire, to dry away the moisture from the beans. When quite dry and hot, add
the butter, pepper, salt, and lemon-juice; keep moving the stewpan, without using a spoon,
as that would break the beans; and when the butter is melted, and all is thoroughly hot, serve.
If the butter should not mix well, add a tablespoonful of gravy, and serve very quickly.

Time.--About 1/4 hour to boil the beans; 10 minutes to shake them over the fire.

Average cost, in full season, about 1s. 4d. a peck.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of September.

BOILED BROAD OR WINDSOR BEANS.

1092.

Mode.--This is a favourite vegetable with many persons, but to be nice, should be young and
freshly gathered. After shelling the beans, put them into boiling water, salted in the above
proportion, and let them boil rapidly until tender. Drain them well in a colander; dish, and
serve with them separately a tureen of parsley and butter. Boiled bacon should always accompany
this vegetable, but the beans should be cooked separately. It is usually served with the beans
laid round, and the parsley and butter in a tureen. Beans also make an excellent garnish to
a ham, and when used for this purpose, if very old, should have their skins removed.

Time.--Very young beans, 15 minutes; when of a moderate size, 20 to 25 minutes, or longer.

Average cost, unshelled, 6d. per peck.

Sufficient.--Allow one peck for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable in July and August.

    NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF THE BEAN.--The produce of beans in meal
    is, like that of peas, more in proportion to the grain than in
    any of the cereal grasses. A bushel of beans is supposed to
    yield fourteen pounds more of flour than a bushel of oats; and a
    bushel of peas eighteen pounds more, or, according to some,
    twenty pounds. A thousand parts of bean flour were found by Sir
    II. Davy to yield 570 parts of nutritive matter, of which 426
    were mucilage or starch, 103 gluten, and 41 extract, or matter
    rendered insoluble during the process.

BROAD BEANS A LA POULETTE.

1093. INGREDIENTS.--2 pints of broad beans, 1/2 pint of stock or broth, a small bunch of savoury
herbs, including parsley, a small lump of sugar, the yolk of 1 egg, 1/4 pint of cream, pepper
and salt to taste.

Mode.--Procure some young and freshly-gathered beans, and shell sufficient to make 2 pints;
boil them, as in the preceding recipe, until nearly done; then drain them and put them into
a stewpan, with the stock, finely-minced herbs, and sugar. Stew the beans until perfectly tender,
and the liquor has dried away a little; then beat up the yolk of an egg with the cream, add
this to the beans, let the whole get thoroughly hot, and when on the point of simmering, serve.
Should the beans be very large, the skin should be removed previously to boiling them.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the beans, 15 minutes to stew them in the stock.

Average cost, unshelled, 6d. per peck.

Seasonable in July and August.

    ORIGIN AND VARIETIES OF THE BEAN.--This valuable plant is said
    to be a native of Egypt, but, like other plants which have been
    domesticated, its origin is uncertain. It has been cultivated in
    Europe and Asia from time immemorial, and has been long known in
    Britain. Its varieties may be included under two general
    heads,--the white, or garden beans, and the grey, or field
    beans, of the former, sown in the fields, the mazagan and
    long-pod are almost the only sorts; of the latter, those known
    as the horse-bean, the small or ticks, and the prolific of
    Heligoland, are the principal sorts. New varieties are procured
    in the same manner as in other plants.

BOILED BEETROOT.

1094. INGREDIENTS,--Beetroot; boiling water.

Mode.--When large, young, and juicy, this vegetable makes a very excellent addition to winter
salads, and may easily be converted into an economical and quickly-made pickle. (See No. 369.)
Beetroot is more frequently served cold than hot: when the latter mode is preferred, melted
butter should be sent to table with it. It may also be stewed with button onions, or boiled
and served with roasted onions. Wash the beets thoroughly; but do not prick or break the skin
before they are cooked, or they would lose their beautiful colour in boiling. Put them into
boiling water, and let them boil until tender, keeping them well covered. If to be served hot,
remove the peel quickly, cut the beetroot into thick slices, and send to table melted butter.
For salads, pickle, &c., let the root cool, then peel, and cut it into slices.

Time.--Small beetroot, 1-1/2 to 2 hours; large, 2-1/2 to 3 hours.

Average cost, in full season, 2d. each.

Seasonable.--May be had at any time.

    BEETROOT.--The geographical distribution of the order Saltworts
    (Salxolaceae), to which beetroot belongs, is most common in
    extra-tropical and temperate regions, where they are common
    weeds, frequenting waste places, among rubbish, and on marshes
    by the seashore. In the tropics they are rare. They are
    characterized by the large quantities of mucilage, sugar,
    starch, and alkaline salts which are found in them. Many of them
    are used as potherbs, and some are emetic and vermifuge in their
    medicinal properties. The root of garden or red beet is
    exceedingly wholesome and nutritious, and Dr. Lyon Playfair has
    recommended that a good brown bread may be made by rasping down
    this root with an equal quantity of flour. He says that the
    average quality of flour contains about 12 per cent. of azotized
    principles adapted for the formation of flesh, and the average
    quality of beet contains about 2 per cent. of the same
    materials.

BOILED BROCOLI.

1095.

Mode.--Strip off the dead outside leaves, and the inside ones cut off level with the flower;
cut off the stalk close at the bottom, and put the brocoli into cold salt and water, with the
heads downwards. When they have remained in this for about 3/4 hour, and they are perfectly
free from insects, put them into a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion,
and keep them boiling quickly over a brisk fire, with the saucepan uncovered. Take them up
with a slice the moment they are done; drain them well, and serve with a tureen of melted butter,
a little of which should be poured over the brocoli. If left in the water after it is done,
it will break, its colour will be spoiled, and its crispness gone.

Time.--Small brocoli, 10 to 15 minutes; large one, 20 to 25 minutes.

Average cost, 2d. each.

Sufficient,--2 for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from October to March; plentiful in February and March.

    THE KOHL-RABI, OR TURNIP-CABBAGE.--This variety presents a
    singular development, inasmuch as the stem swells out like a
    large turnip on the surface of the ground, the leaves shooting
    from it all round, and the top being surmounted by a cluster of
    leaves issuing from it. Although not generally grown as a garden
    vegetable, if used when young and tender, it is wholesome,
    nutritious, and very palatable.

BOILED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

1096. Another mode of serving is, when they are dished, to stir in about 1-1/2 oz. of butter
and a seasoning of pepper and salt. They must, however, be sent to table very quickly, as,
being so very small, this vegetable soon cools. Where the cook is very expeditious, this vegetable,
when cooked, may be arranged on the dish in the form of a pineapple, and, so served, has a
very pretty appearance.

Time.--From 9 to 12 minutes after the water boils.

Average cost, 1s. 4d. per peck.

Sufficient.--Allow between 40 and 50 for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from November to March.

    SAVOYS AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--When the Green Kale, or Borecole,
    has been advanced a step further in the path of improvement, it
    assumes the headed or hearting character, with blistered leaves;
    it is then known by the name of Savoys and Brussels Sprouts.
    Another of its headed forms, but with smooth glaucous leaves, is
    the cultivated Cabbage of our gardens (the Borecole oleracea
    capitula of science); and all its varieties of green, red,
    dwarf, tall, early, late, round, conical, flat, and all the
    forms into which it is possible to put it.

TO BOIL YOUNG GREENS OR SPROUTS.

1097. Keep them boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered, until tender; and the moment they
are done, take them up, or their colour will be spoiled; when well drained, serve. The great
art in cooking greens properly, and to have them a good colour, is to put them into plenty
of fast-boiling water, to let them boil very quickly, and to take them up the moment they become
tender.

Time.--Brocoli sprouts, 10 to 12 minutes; young greens, 10 to 12 minutes; sprouts, 12 minutes,
after the water boils.

Seasonable.--Sprouts of various kinds may be had all the year.

    GREEN KALE, OR BORECOLE.--When Colewort, or Wild Cabbage, is
    brought into a state of cultivation, its character becomes
    greatly improved, although it still retains the loose open
    leaves, and in this form it is called Green Kale, or Borecole.
    The scientific name is Borecole oleracea acephala, and of it
    there are many varieties, both as regards the form and colour of
    the leaves, as well as the height which the plants attain. We
    may observe, that among them, are included the Thousand-headed,
    and the Cow or Tree Cabbage.

BOILED CABBAGE.

1098. Wash them well in cold water, place them in a colander, and drain; then put them into
plenty of fast-boiling water, to which have been added salt and soda in the above proportions.
Stir them down once or twice in the water, keep the pan uncovered, and let them boil quickly
until tender. The instant they are done, take them up into a colander, place a plate over them,
let them thoroughly drain, dish, and serve.

Time.--Large cabbages, or savoys, 1/3 to 3/4 hour, young summer cabbage, 10 to 12 minutes,
after the water boils.

Average cost, 2d. each in full season.

Sufficient,--2 large ones for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable.--Cabbages and sprouts of various kinds at any time.

    THE CABBAGE TRIBE: THEIR ORIGIN.--Of all the tribes of the
    Cruciferae this is by far the most important. Its scientific
    name is Brassiceae, and it contains a collection of plants
    which, both in themselves and their products, occupy a prominent
    position in agriculture, commerce, and domestic economy. On the
    cliffs of Dover, and in many places on the coasts of
    Dorsetshire, Cornwall, and Yorkshire, there grows a wild plant,
    with variously-indented, much-waved, and loose spreading leaves,
    of a sea-green colour, and large yellow flowers. In spring, the
    leaves of this plant are collected by the inhabitants, who,
    after boiling them in two waters, to remove the saltness, use
    them as a vegetable along with their meat. This is the Brassica
    oleracea of science, the Wild Cabbage, or Colewort, from which
    have originated all the varieties of Cabbage, Cauliflower,
    Greens, and Brocoli.

STEWED RED CABBAGE.

1099. INGREDIENTS.--1 red cabbage, a small slice of ham, 1/2 oz. of fresh butter, 1 pint of
weak stock or broth, 1 gill of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Cut the cabbage into very thin slices, put it into a stewpan, with the ham cut in dice,
the butter, 1/2 pint of stock, and the vinegar; cover the pan closely, and let it stew for
1 hour. When it is very tender, add the remainder of the stock, a seasoning of salt and pepper,
and the pounded sugar; mix all well together, stir over the fire until nearly all the liquor
is dried away, and serve. Fried sausages are usually sent to table with this dish: they should
be laid round and on the cabbage, as a garnish.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour. Average cost, 4d. each.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable from September to January.

    THE WILD CABBAGE, OR COLEWORT.--This plant, as it is found on
    the sea-cliffs of England, presents us with the origin of the
    cabbage tribe in its simplest and normal form. In this state it
    is the true Collet, or Colewort, although the name is now
    applied to any young cabbage which has a loose and open heart.

BOILED CARROTS.

1100.

Mode.--Cut off the green tops, wash and scrape the carrots, and should there be any black specks,
remove them. If very large, cut them in halves, divide them lengthwise into four pieces, and
put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion; let them boil until tender, which
may be ascertained by thrusting a fork into them: dish, and serve very hot. This vegetable
is an indispensable accompaniment to boiled beef. When thus served, it is usually boiled with
the beef; a few carrots are placed round the dish as a garnish, and the remainder sent to table
in a vegetable-dish. Young carrots do not require nearly so much boiling, nor should they be
divided: these make a nice addition to stewed veal, &c.

Time.--Large carrots, 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 hours; young ones, about 1/2 hour.

Average cost, 6d. to 8d, per bunch of 18.

Sufficient,--4 large carrots for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.

    ORIGIN OF THE CARROT.--In its wild state, this vegetable is
    found plentifully in Britain, both in cultivated lands and by
    waysides, and is known by the name of birds-nest, from its
    umbels of fruit becoming incurved from a hollow cup, like a
    birds-nest. In this state its root is whitish, slender, and
    hard, with an acrid, disagreeable taste, and a strong aromatic
    smell, and was formerly used as an aperient. When cultivated, it
    is reddish, thick, fleshy, with a pleasant odour, and a
    peculiar, sweet, mucilaginous taste. The carrot is said by
    naturalists not to contain much nourishing matter, and,
    generally speaking, is somewhat difficult of digestion.

TO DRESS CARROTS IN THE GERMAN WAY.

1101. INGREDIENTS.--8 large carrots, 3 oz. of butter, salt to taste, a very little grated nutmeg,
1 tablespoonful of finely-minced parsley, 1 dessertspoonful of minced onion, rather more than
1 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 tablespoonful of flour.

Mode.--Wash and scrape the carrots, and cut them into rings of about 1/4 inch in thickness.
Put the butter into a stewpan; when it is melted, lay in the carrots, with salt, nutmeg, parsley,
and onion in the above proportions. Toss the stewpan over the fire for a few minutes, and when
the carrots are well saturated with the butter, pour in the stock, and simmer gently until
they are nearly tender. Then put into another stewpan a small piece of butter; dredge in about
a tablespoonful of flour; stir this over the fire, and when of a nice brown colour, add the
liquor that the carrots have been boiling in; let this just boil up, pour it over the carrots
in the other stewpan, and let them finish simmering until quite tender. Serve very hot.

Seasonable.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.

    CONSTITUENTS OF THE CARROT.--These are crystallizable and
    uncrystallizable sugar, a little starch, extractive, gluten,
    albumen, volatile oil, vegetable jelly, or pectin, saline
    matter, malic acid, and a peculiar crystallizable ruby-red
    neuter principle, without odour or taste, called carotin. This
    vegetable jelly, or pectin, so named from its singular property
    of gelatinizing, is considered by some as another form of gum or
    mucilage, combined with vegetable acid. It exists more or less
    in all vegetables, and is especially abundant in those roots and
    fruits from which jellies are prepared.

STEWED CARROTS.

1102. INGREDIENTS.--7 or 8 large carrots, 1 teacupful of broth, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2
teacupful of cream, thickening of butter and flour.

Mode.--Scrape the carrots nicely; half-boil, and slice them into a stewpan; add the broth,
pepper and salt, and cream; simmer till tender, and be careful the carrots are not broken.
A few minutes before serving, mix a little flour with about 1 oz. of butter; thicken the gravy
with this; let it just boil up, and serve.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to parboil the carrots, about 20 minutes to cook them after they are sliced.

Average cost, 6d. to 8d. per bunch of 18.

    NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF THE CARROT.--Sir H. Davy ascertained the
    nutritive matter of the carrot to amount to ninety-eight parts
    in one thousand; of which ninety-five are sugar and three are
    starch. It is used in winter and spring in the dairy to give
    colour and flavour to butter; and it is excellent in stews,
    haricots, soups, and, when boiled whole, with salt beef. In the
    distillery, owing to the great proportion of sugar in its
    composition, it yields more spirit than the potato. The usual
    quantity is twelve gallons per ton.

SLICED CARROTS.

(Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course, as a Side-dish.)

1103. INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 large carrots, a large lump of sugar, 1 pint of weak stock, 3 oz.
of fresh butter, salt to taste.

Mode.--Scrape and wash the carrots, cut them into slices of an equal size, and boil them in
salt and water, until half done; drain them well, put them into a stewpan with the sugar and
stock, and let them boil over a brisk fire. When reduced to a glaze, add the fresh butter and
a seasoning of salt; shake the stewpan about well, and when the butter is well mixed with the
carrots, serve. There should be no sauce in the dish when it comes to table, but it should
all adhere to the carrots.

Seasonable.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.

    THE SEED OF THE CARROT.--In order to save the seed of carrots,
    the plan is, to select annually the most perfect and best-shaped
    roots in the taking-up season, and either preserve them in sand
    in a cellar till spring, or plant them immediately in an open
    airy part of the garden, protecting them with litter during
    severe frost, or earthing them over, and uncovering them in
    March following. The seed is in no danger from being injured by
    any other plant. In August it is fit to gather, and is best
    preserved on the stalks till wanted.

BOILED CAULIFLOWERS.

1104.

Mode.--Choose cauliflowers that are close and white; trim off the decayed outside leaves, and
cut the stalk off flat at the bottom. Open the flower a little in places to remove the insects,
which generally are found about the stalk, and let the cauliflowers lie in salt and water for
an hour previous to dressing them, with their heads downwards: this will effectually draw out
all the vermin. Then put them into fast-boiling water, with the addition of salt in the above
proportion, and let them boil briskly over a good fire, keeping the saucepan uncovered. The
water should be well skimmed; and, when the cauliflowers are tender, take them up with a slice;
let them drain, and, if large enough, place them upright in the dish. Serve with plain melted
butter, a little of which may be poured over the flower.

Time.--Small cauliflower, 12 to 15 minutes, large one, 20 to 25 minutes, after the water boils.

Average cost, for large cauliflowers, 6d. each.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 large cauliflower for 3 persons.

Seasonable from the beginning of June to the end of September.

CAULIFLOWERS A LA SAUCE BLANCHE.

(Entremets, or Side-dish, to be served with the Second Course.)

1105. INGREDIENTS.--3 cauliflowers, 1/2 pint of sauce blanche, or French melted butter, No.
378; 3 oz. of butter; salt and water.

Mode.--Cleanse the cauliflowers as in the preceding recipe, and cut the stalks off flat at
the bottom; boil them until tender in salt and water, to which the above proportion of butter
has been added, and be careful to take them up the moment they are done, or they will break,
and the appearance of the dish will be spoiled. Drain them well, and dish them in the shape
of a large cauliflower. Have ready 1/2 pint of sauce, made by recipe No. 378, pour it over
the flowers, and serve hot and quickly.

Sufficient,--1 large cauliflower for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from the beginning of June to the end of September.

    CAULIFLOWER AND BROCOLI.--These are only forms of the wild
    Cabbage in its cultivated state. They are both well known; but
    we may observe, that the purple and white Brocoli are only
    varieties of the Cauliflower.

CAULIFLOWERS WITH PARMESAN CHEESE.

(Entremets, or Side-dish, to be served with the Second Course.)

1106. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cauliflowers, rather more than 1/2 pint of white sauce No. 378,
2 tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, 2 oz. of fresh butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of bread
crumbs.

Mode.--Cleanse and boil the cauliflowers by recipe No. 1104, and drain them and dish them with
the flowers standing upright. Have ready the above proportion of white sauce; pour sufficient
of it over the cauliflowers just to cover the top; sprinkle over this some rasped Parmesan
cheese and bread crumbs, and drop on these the butter, which should be melted, but not oiled.
Brown with a salamander, or before the fire, and pour round, but not over, the flowers the
remainder of the sauce, with which should be mixed a small quantity of grated Parmesan cheese.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. Average cost, for large cauliflowers, 6d. each.

Sufficient,--3 small cauliflowers for 1 dish.

Seasonable from the beginning of June to the end of September.

CELERY.

1107. With a good heart, and nicely blanched, this vegetable is generally eaten raw, and is
usually served with the cheese. Let the roots be washed free from dirt, all the decayed and
outside leaves being cut off, preserving as much of the stalk as possible, and all specks or
blemishes being carefully removed. Should the celery be large, divide it lengthwise into quarters,
and place it, root downwards, in a celery-glass, which should be rather more than half filled
with water. The top leaves may be curled, by shredding them in narrow strips with the point
of a clean skewer, at a distance of about 4 inches from the top.

Average cost, 2d. per head.

Sufficient.--Allow 2 heads for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from October to April.

Note.--This vegetable is exceedingly useful for flavouring soups, sauces, &c., and makes a
very nice addition to winter salad.

STEWED CELERY A LA CREME.

1108.

Mode.--Wash the celery thoroughly; trim, and boil it in salt and water until tender. Put the
cream and pounded mace into a stewpan; shake it over the fire until the cream thickens, dish
the celery, pour over the sauce, and serve.

Time.--Large heads of celery, 25 minutes; small ones, 15 to 20 minutes.

Average cost. 2d. per head.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from October to April.

ALEXANDERS.--This plant is the Smyrnium olustratum of science, and is used in this country
in the same way in which celery is. It is a native of Great Britain, and is found in its wild
state near the seacoast. It received its name from the Italian "herba Alexandrina," and is
supposed to have been originally brought from Alexandria; but, be this as it may, its cultivation
is now almost entirely abandoned.

STEWED CELERY (with White Sauce).

I.

1109.

Mode.--Have ready sufficient boiling water just to cover the celery, with salt and butter in
the above proportion. Wash the celery well; cut off the decayed outside leaves, trim away the
green tops, and shape the root into a point; put it into the boiling water; let it boil rapidly
until tender; then take it out, drain well, place it upon a dish, and pour over about 1/2 pint
of white sauce, made by either of the recipes No. 537 or 538. It may also be plainly boiled
as above, placed on toast, and melted butter poured over, the same as asparagus is dished.

    ORIGIN OF CELERY.--In the marshes and ditches of this country
    there is to be found a very common plant, known by the name of
    Smallage. This is the wild form of celery; but, by being
    subjected to cultivation, it loses its acrid nature, and becomes
    mild and sweet. In its natural state, it has a peculiar rank,
    coarse taste and smell, and its root was reckoned by the
    ancients as one of the "five greater aperient roots." There is a
    variety of this in which the root becomes turnip-shaped and
    large. It is called Celeriae, and is extensively used by the
    Germans, and preferred by them to celery. In a raw state, this
    plant does not suit weak stomachs; cooked, it is less difficult
    of digestion, although a large quantity should not he taken.

II.

1110. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of celery, 1/2 pint of white stock or weak broth, 4 tablespoonfuls
of cream, thickening of butter and flour, 1 blade of pounded mace, a very little grated nutmeg;
pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Wash the celery, strip off the outer leaves, and cut it into lengths of about 4 inches.
Put these into a saucepan, with the broth, and stew till tender, which will be in from 20 to
25 minutes; then add the remaining ingredients, simmer altogether for 4 or 5 minutes, pour
into a dish, and serve.

Note.--By cutting the celery into smaller pieces, by stewing it a little longer, and, when
done, by pressing it through a sieve, the above stew may be converted into a puree of celery.

TO DRESS CUCUMBERS.

1111. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and pepper
to taste; cucumber.

Mode.--Pare the cucumber, cut it equally into very thin slices, and commence cutting from the
thick end; if commenced at the stalk, the cucumber will most likely have an exceedingly bitter
taste, far from agreeable. Put the slices into a dish, sprinkle over salt and pepper, and pour
over oil and vinegar in the above proportion; turn the cucumber about, and it is ready to serve.
This is a favourite accompaniment to boiled salmon, is a nice addition to all descriptions
of salads, and makes a pretty garnish to lobster salad.

Average cost, when scarce, 1s. to 2s. 6d.; when cheapest, may be had for 4d. each.

Seasonable.--Forced from the beginning of March to the end of June; in full season in July,
August, and September.

    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE CUCUMBERS.--This family is not
    known in the frigid zone, is somewhat rare in the temperate, but
    in the tropical and warmer regions throughout the world they are
    abundant. They are most plentiful in the continent of Hindostan;
    but in America are not near so plentiful. Many of the kinds
    supply useful articles of consumption for food, and others are
    actively medicinal in their virtues. Generally speaking,
    delicate stomachs should avoid this plant, for it is cold and
    indigestible.

CUCUMBERS A LA POULETTE.

1112. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cucumbers, salt and vinegar, 2 oz. of butter, flour, 1/2 pint of
broth, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, a lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, salt and pepper
to taste.

Mode.--Pare and cut the cucumbers into slices of an equal thickness, and let them remain in
a pickle of salt and vinegar for 1/2 hour; then drain them in a cloth, and put them into a
stewpan with the butter. Fry them over a brisk fire, but do not brown them, and then dredge
over them a little flour; add the broth, skim off all the fat, which will rise to the surface,
and boil gently until the gravy is somewhat reduced; but the cucumber should not be broken.
Stir in the yolks of the eggs, add the parsley, sugar, and a seasoning of pepper and salt;
bring the whole to the point of boiling, and serve.

Time.--Altogether, 1 hour.

Average cost, when cheapest, 4d. each.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable in July, August, and September; but may be had, forced, from the beginning of March.

FRIED CUCUMBERS.

1113. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cucumbers, pepper and salt to taste, flour, oil or butter.

Mode.--Pare the cucumbers and cut them into slices of an equal thickness, commencing to slice
from the thick, and not the stalk end of the cucumber. Wipe the slices dry with a cloth, dredge
them with flour, and put them into a pan of boiling oil or butter; Keep turning them about
until brown; lift them out of the pan, let them drain, and serve, piled lightly in a dish.
These will be found a great improvement to rump-steak: they should be placed on a dish with
the steak on the top.

Time.--5 minutes. Average cost, when cheapest, 4d. each.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

    PROPERTIES AND USES OF THE CUCURBITS.--The common cucumber is
    the C. sativus of science, and although the whole of the family
    have a similar action in the animal economy, yet there are some
    which present us with great anomalies. The roots of those which
    are perennial contain, besides fecula, which is their base, a
    resinous, acrid, and bitter principle. The fruits of this
    family, however, have in general a sugary taste, and are more or
    less dissolving and perfumed, as we find in the melons, gourds,
    cucumbers, vegetable-marrows, and squashes. But these are
    slightly laxative if partaken of largely. In tropical countries,
    this order furnishes the inhabitants with a large portion of
    their food, which, even in the most arid deserts and most barren
    islands, is of the finest quality. In China, Cashmere, and
    Persia, they are cultivated on the lakes on the floating
    collections of weeds common in these localities. In India they
    are everywhere abundant, either in a cultivated or wild state,
    and the seeds of all the family are sweet and mucilaginous.

STEWED CUCUMBERS.

1114. INGREDIENTS.--3 large cucumbers, flour, butter, rather more than 1/2 pint of good brown
gravy.

Mode.--Cut the cucumbers lengthwise the size of the dish they are intended to be served in;
empty them of the seeds, and put them into boiling water with a little salt, and let them simmer
for 5 minutes; then take them out, place them in another stewpan, with the gravy, and let them
boil over a brisk fire until the cucumbers are tender. Should these be bitter, add a lump of
sugar; carefully dish them, skim the sauce, pour over the cucumbers, and serve.

Time.--Altogether, 20 minutes.

Average cost, when cheapest, 1d. each.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable in June, July, and August; but may be had, forced, from the beginning of March.

    THE CHATE.--This cucumber is a native of Egypt and Arabia, and
    produces a fruit of almost the same substance as that of the
    Melon. In Egypt it is esteemed by the upper class natives, as
    well as by Europeans, as the most pleasant fruit they have.

STEWED CUCUMBERS WITH ONIONS.

1115. INGREDIENTS.--6 cucumbers, 3 moderate-sized onions, not quite 1 pint of white stock,
cayenne and salt to taste, the yolks of 2 eggs, a very little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Pare and slice the cucumbers, take out the seeds, and cut the onions into thin slices;
put these both into a stewpan, with the stock, and let them boil for 1/4 hour or longer, should
the cucumbers be very large. Beat up the yolks of 2 eggs; stir these into the sauce; add the
cayenne, salt, and grated nutmeg; bring it to the point of boiling, and serve. Do not allow
the sauce to boil, or it will curdle. This is a favourite dish with lamb or mutton chops, rump-steaks,
&c.

Time.--Altogether, 20 minutes.

Average cost, when cheapest, 4d. each.

    THE MELON.--This is another species of the cucumber, and is
    highly esteemed for its rich and delicious fruit. It was
    introduced to this country from Jamaica, in 1570; since which
    period it has continued to be cultivated. It was formerly called
    the Musk Melon.

ENDIVE.

1116. This vegetable, so beautiful in appearance, makes an excellent addition to winter salad,
when lettuces and other salad herbs are not obtainable. It is usually placed in the centre
of the dish, and looks remarkably pretty with slices of beetroot, hard-boiled eggs, and curled
celery placed round it, so that the colours contrast nicely. In preparing it, carefully wash
and cleanse it free from insects, which are generally found near the heart; remove any decayed
or dead leaves, and dry it thoroughly by shaking in a cloth. This vegetable may also be served
hot, stewed in cream, brown gravy, or butter; but when dressed thus, the sauce it is stewed
in should not be very highly seasoned, as that would destroy and overpower the flavour of the
vegetable.

Average cost, 1d. per head.

Sufficient,--1 head for a salad for 4 persons.

Seasonable from November to March.

    ENDIVE.--This is the C. endivium of science, and is much used
    as a salad. It belongs to the family of the Compositae, with
    Chicory, common Goats-beard, and others of the same genus.
    Withering states, that before the stems of the common
    Goats-beard shoot up the roots, boiled like asparagus, have the
    same flavour, and are nearly as nutritious. We are also informed
    by Villars that the children in Dauphiné universally eat the
    stems and leaves of the young plant before the flowers appear,
    with great avidity. The fresh juice of these tender herbs is
    said to be the best solvent of bile.

STEWED ENDIVE.

1117. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of endive, salt and water, 1 pint of broth, thickening of butter
and flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, a small lump of sugar.

Mode.--Wash and free the endive thoroughly from insects, remove the green part of the leaves,
and put it into boiling water, slightly salted. Let it remain for 10 minutes; then take it
out, drain it till there is no water remaining, and chop it very fine. Put it into a stewpan
with the broth; add a little salt and a lump of sugar, and boil until the endive is perfectly
tender. When done, which may be ascertained by squeezing a piece between the thumb and finger,
add a thickening of butter and flour and the lemon-juice: let the sauce boil up, and serve.

Time.--10 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to simmer in the broth.

Average cost, 1d. per head.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from November to March.

ENDIVE A LA FRANCAISE.

1118. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of endive, 1 pint of broth, 3 oz. of fresh butter; salt, pepper,
and grated nutmeg to taste.

Mode.--Wash and boil the endive as in the preceding recipe; chop it rather fine, and put into
a stewpan with the broth; boil over a brisk fire until the sauce is all reduced; then put in
the butter, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg (the latter must be very sparingly used); mix all
well together, bring it to the boiling point, and serve very hot.

TO BOIL HARICOTS BLANCS, or WHITE HARICOT BEANS.

1119. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 2 quarts of soft water, 1 oz. of butter,
1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.

Mode.--Put the beans into cold water, and let them soak from 2 to 4 hours, according to their
age; then put them into cold water, salted in the above proportion, bring them to boil, and
let them simmer very slowly until tender; pour the water away from them, let them stand by
the side of the fire, with the lid of the saucepan partially off, to allow the beans to dry;
then add 1 oz. of butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Shake the beans about for a minute
or two, and serve: do not stir them with a spoon, for fear of breaking them to pieces.

Time.--After the water boils, from 2 to 2-1/2 hours.

Average cost, 4d. per quart.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable in winter, when other vegetables are scarce.

Note.--Haricots blancs, when new and fresh, should be put into boiling water, and do not require
any soaking previous to dressing.

    HARICOTS AND LENTILS.--Although these vegetables are not much
    used in this country, yet in France, and other Catholic
    countries, from their peculiar constituent properties, they form
    an excellent substitute for animal food during Lent and maigre
    days. At the time of the prevalence of the Roman religion in
    this country, they were probably much more generally used than
    at present. As reformations are often carried beyond necessity,
    possibly lentils may have fallen into disuse, as an article of
    diet amongst Protestants, for fear the use of them might be
    considered a sign of popery.

HARICOTS BLANCS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.

1120. If the water should boil away, replenish it with a little more cold, which makes the
skin of the beans tender. Let them be very thoroughly done; drain them well; then add to them
the butter, minced parsley, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Keep moving the stewpan over
the fire without using a spoon, as this would break the beans; and, when the various ingredients
are well mixed with them, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve very hot.

Time.--From 2 to 2-1/2 hours to boil the beans.

    HARICOT BEANS.--This is the haricot blanc of the French, and
    is a native of India. It ripens readily, in dry summers, in most
    parts of Britain, but its culture has hitherto been confined to
    gardens in England; but in Germany and Switzerland it is grown
    in fields. It is usually harvested by pulling up the plants,
    which, being dried, are stacked and thrashed. The haulm is both
    of little bulk and little use, but the seed is used in making
    the esteemed French dish called haricot, with which it were well
    if the working classes of this country were acquainted. There
    is, perhaps, no other vegetable dish so cheap and easily cooked,
    and, at the same time, so agreeable and nourishing. The beans
    are boiled, and then mixed with a little fat or salt butter, and
    a little milk or water and flour. From 3,840 parts of
    kidney-bean Einholff obtained 1,805 parts of matter analogous to
    starch, 351 of vegeto-animal matter, and 799 parts of mucilage.

HARICOT BEANS AND MINCED ONIONS.

1121. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 4 middling-sized onions, 1/4 pint of good
brown gravy, pepper and salt to taste, a little flour.

Mode.--Peel and mince the onions not too finely, and fry them in butter of a light brown colour;
dredge over them a little flour, and add the gravy and a seasoning of pepper and salt.

HORSERADISH.

1122. This root, scraped, is always served with hot roast beef, and is used for garnishing
many kinds of boiled fish. Let the horseradish remain in cold water for an hour; wash it well,
and with a sharp knife scrape it into very thin shreds, commencing from the thick end of the
root. Arrange some of it lightly in a small glass dish, and the remainder use for garnishing
the joint: it should be placed in tufts round the border of the dish, with 1 or 2 bunches on
the meat.

Average cost, 2d. per stick.

Seasonable from October to June.

    THE HORSERADISH.--This belongs to the tribe Alyssidae, and is
    highly stimulant and exciting to the stomach. It has been
    recommended in chronic rheumatism, palsy, dropsical complaints,
    and in cases of enfeebled digestion. Its principal use, however,
    is as a condiment to promote appetite and excite the digestive
    organs. The horseradish contains sulphur to the extent of thirty
    per cent, in the number of its elements; and it is to the
    presence of this quality that the metal vessels in which the
    radish is sometimes distilled, are turned into a black colour.
    It is one of the most powerful excitants and antiscorbutics we
    have, and forms the basis of several medical preparations, in
    the form of wines, tinctures, and syrups.

LETTUCES.

1123. These form one of the principal ingredients to summer salads; should be nicely blanched,
and be eaten young. They are seldom served in any other way, but may be stewed and sent to
table in a good brown gravy flavoured with lemon-juice. In preparing them for a salad, carefully
wash them free from dirt, pick off all the decayed and outer leaves, and dry them thoroughly
by shaking them in a cloth. Cut off the stalks, and either halve or cut the lettuces into small
pieces. The manner of cutting them up entirely depends on the salad for which they are intended.
In France the lettuces are sometimes merely wiped with a cloth and not washed, the cooks there
declaring that the act of washing them injuriously affects the pleasant crispness of the plant:
in this case scrupulous attention must be paid to each leaf, and the grit thoroughly wiped away.

Average cost, when cheapest, 1d. each.

Sufficient.--Allow 2 lettuces for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from March to the end of August, but may be had all the year.

    THE LETTUCE.--All the varieties of the garden lettuce have
    originated from the Lactuca sativa of science, which has never
    yet been found in a wild state. Hence it may be concluded that
    it is merely another form of some species, changed through the
    effects of cultivation. In its young state, the lettuce forms a
    well-known and wholesome salad, containing a bland pellucid
    juice, with little taste or smell, and having a cooling and
    soothing influence on the system. This arises from the large
    quantities of water and mucilage it contains, and not from any
    narcotic principle which it is supposed to possess. During the
    period of flowering, it abounds in a peculiar milky juice, which
    flows from the stem when wounded, and which has been found to be
    possessed of decided medicinal properties.

BAKED MUSHROOMS.

(A Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper Dish.)

1124. INGREDIENTS.--16 to 20 mushroom-flaps, butter, pepper to taste.

Mode.--For this mode of cooking, the mushroom flaps are better than the buttons, and should
not be too large. Cut off a portion of the stalk, peel the top, and wipe the mushrooms carefully
with a piece of flannel and a little fine salt. Put them into a tin baking-dish, with a very
small piece of butter placed on each mushroom; sprinkle over a little pepper, and let them
bake for about 20 minutes, or longer should the mushrooms be very large. Have ready a very
hot dish, pile the mushrooms high in the centre, pour the gravy round, and send them to table
quickly, with very hot plates.

Time.--20 minutes; large mushrooms, 1/2 hour.

Average cost, 1d. each for large mushroom-flaps.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October; cultivated mushrooms may be had at
any time.

    FUNGI.--These are common parasitical plants, originating in the
    production of copious filamentous threads, called the mycelium,
    or spawn. Rounded tubers appear on the mycelium; some of these
    enlarge rapidly, burst an outer covering, which is left at the
    base, and protrude a thick stalk, bearing at its summit a
    rounded body, which in a short time expands into the pileus or
    cap. The gills, which occupy its lower surface, consist of
    parallel plates, bearing naked sporules over their whole
    surface. Some of the cells, which are visible by the microscope,
    produce four small cells at their free summit, apparently by
    germination and constriction. These are the sporules, and this
    is the development of the Agarics.

BROILED MUSHROOMS.

(A Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper Dish.)

1125. INGREDIENTS.--Mushroom-flaps, pepper and salt to taste, butter, lemon-juice.

Mode.--Cleanse the mushrooms by wiping them with a piece of flannel and a little salt; cut
off a portion of the stalk, and peel the tops: broil them over a clear fire, turning them once,
and arrange them on a very hot dish. Put a small piece of butter on each mushroom, season with
pepper and salt, and squeeze over them a few drops of lemon-juice. Place the dish before the
fire, and when the butter is melted, serve very hot and quickly. Moderate-sized flaps are better
suited to this mode of cooking than the buttons: the latter are better in stews.

Time.--10 minutes for medium-sized mushrooms.

Average cost, 1d. each for large mushrooms.

Sufficient.--Allow 3 or 4 mushrooms to each person.

    VARIETIES OF THE MUSHROOM.--The common mushroom found in our
    pastures is the Agaricus campestris of science, and another
    edible British species is A. Georgii; but A. primulus is
    affirmed to be the most delicious mushroom. The morel is
    Morchella esculenta, and Tuber cibarium is the common
    truffle. There is in New Zealand a long fungus, which grows from
    the head of a caterpillar, and which forms a horn, as it were,
    and is called Sphaeria Robertsii.

TO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS.

1126. INGREDIENTS.--To each quart of mushrooms, allow 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste,
the juice of 1 lemon, clarified butter.

Mode.--Peel the mushrooms, put them into cold water, with a little lemon-juice; take them out
and dry them very carefully in a cloth. Put the butter into a stewpan capable of holding the
mushrooms; when it is melted, add the mushrooms, lemon-juice, and a seasoning of pepper and
salt; draw them down over a slow fire, and let them remain until their liquor is boiled away,
and they have become quite dry, but be careful in not allowing them to stick to the bottom
of the stewpan. When done, put them into pots, and pour over the top clarified butter. If wanted
for immediate use, they will keep good a few days without being covered over. To re-warm them,
put the mushrooms into a stewpan, strain the butter from them, and they will be ready for use.

Average cost, 1d. each.

    LOCALITIES OF THE MUSHROOM.--Mushrooms are to be met with in
    pastures, woods, and marshes, but are very capricious and
    uncertain in their places of growth, multitudes being obtained
    in one season where few or none were to be found in the
    preceding. They sometimes grow solitary, but more frequently
    they are gregarious, and rise in a regular circular form. Many
    species are employed by man as food; but, generally speaking,
    they are difficult of digestion, and by no means very
    nourishing. Many of them are also of suspicious qualities.
    Little reliance can be placed either on their taste, smell, or
    colour, as much depends on the situation in which they vegetate;
    and even the same plant, it is affirmed, may be innocent when
    young, but become noxious when advanced in age.

STEWED MUSHROOMS.

1127. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint mushroom-buttons, 3 oz. of fresh butter, white pepper and salt to
taste, lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful of flour, cream or milk, 1 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Cut off the ends of the stalks, and pare neatly a pint of mushroom-buttons; put them
into a basin of water, with a little lemon-juice, as they are done. When all are prepared,
take them from the water with the hands, to avoid the sediment, and put them into a stewpan
with the fresh butter, white pepper, salt, and the juice of 1/2 lemon; cover the pan closely,
and let the mushrooms stew gently from 20 to 25 minutes; then thicken the butter with the above
proportion of flour, add gradually sufficient cream, or cream and milk, to make the sauce of
a proper consistency, and put in the grated nutmeg. If the mushrooms are not perfectly tender,
stew them for 5 minutes longer, remove every particle of butter which may be floating on the
top, and serve.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, from 9d. to 2s. per pint.

    TO PROCURE MUSHROOMS.--In order to obtain mushrooms at all
    seasons, several methods of propagation have been had recourse
    to. It is said that, in some parts of Italy, a species of stone
    is used for this purpose, which is described as being of two
    different kinds; the one is found in the chalk hills near
    Naples, and has a white, porous, stalactical appearance; the
    other is a hardened turf from some volcanic mountains near
    Florence. These stones are kept in cellars, and occasionally
    moistened with water which has been used in the washing of
    mushrooms, and are thus supplied with their minute seeds. In
    this country, gardeners provide themselves with what is called
    spawn, either from the old manure of cucumber-beds, or
    purchase it from those whose business it is to propagate it.
    When thus procured, it is usually made up for sale in quadrils,
    consisting of numerous white fibrous roots, having a strong
    smell of mushrooms. This is planted in rows, in a dry situation,
    and carefully attended to for five or six weeks, when the bed
    begins to produce, and continues to do so for several months.

STEWED MUSHROOMS IN GRAVY.

1128. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of mushroom-buttons, 1 pint of brown gravy No. 436, 1/4 teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg, cayenne and salt to taste.

Mode.--Make a pint of brown gravy by recipe 436; cut nearly all the stalks away from the mushrooms
and peel the tops; put them into a stewpan, with the gravy, and simmer them gently from 20
minutes to 1/2 hour. Add the nutmeg and a seasoning of cayenne and salt, and serve very hot.

    ANALYSIS OF FUNGI.--The fungi have been examined chemically with
    much care, both by MM. Bracannot and Vauquelin, who designate
    the insoluble spongy matter by the name of fungin, and the
    soluble portion is found to contain the bolotic and the fungic
    acids.

BAKED SPANISH ONIONS.

1129. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 Spanish onions, salt, and water.

Mode.--Put the onions, with their skins on, into a saucepan of boiling water slightly salted,
and let them boil quickly for an hour. Then take them out, wipe them thoroughly, wrap each
one in a piece of paper separately, and bake them in a moderate oven for 2 hours, or longer,
should the onions be very large. They may be served in their skins, and eaten with a piece
of cold butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt; or they may be peeled, and a good brown
gravy poured over them.

Time.--1 hour to boil, 2 hours to bake.

Average cost, medium-sized, 2d. each.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from September to January.

    THE GENUS ALLIUM.--The Onion, like the Leek, Garlic, and Shalot,
    belongs to the genus Allium, which is a numerous species of
    vegetable; and every one of them possesses, more or less, a
    volatile and acrid penetrating principle, pricking the thin
    transparent membrane of the eyelids; and all are very similar in
    their properties. In the whole of them the bulb is the most
    active part, and any one of them may supply the place of the
    other; for they are all irritant, excitant, and vesicant. With
    many, the onion is a very great favourite, and is considered an
    extremely nutritive vegetable. The Spanish kind is frequently
    taken for supper, it being simply boiled, and then seasoned with
    salt, pepper, and butter. Some dredge on a little flour, but
    many prefer it without this.

BURNT ONIONS FOR GRAVIES.

1130. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of onions, 1/3 pint of water, 1/2 lb. of moist sugar, 1/3 pint
of vinegar.

Mode.--Peel and chop the onions fine, and put them into a stewpan (not tinned), with the water;
let them boil for 5 minutes, then add the sugar, and simmer gently until the mixture becomes
nearly black and throws out bubbles of smoke. Have ready the above proportion of boiling vinegar,
strain the liquor gradually to it, and keep stirring with a wooden spoon until it is well incorporated.
When cold, bottle for use.

Time.--Altogether, 1 hour.

    PROPERTIES OF THE ONION.--The onion is possessed of a white,
    acrid, volatile oil, holding sulphur in solution, albumen, a
    good deal of uncrystallizable sugar and mucilage; phosphoric
    acid, both free and combined with lime; acetic acid, citrate of
    lime, and lignine. Of all the species of allium, the onion has
    the volatile principle in the greatest degree; and hence it is
    impossible to separate the scales of the root without the eyes
    being affected. The juice is sensibly acid, and is capable of
    being, by fermentation, converted into vinegar, and, mixed with
    water or the dregs of beer, yields, by distillation, an
    alcoholic liquor. Although used as a common esculent, onions are
    not suited to all stomachs; there are some who cannot eat them
    either fried or roasted, whilst others prefer them boiled, which
    is the best way of using them, as, by the process they then
    undergo, they are deprived of their essential oil. The pulp of
    roasted onions, with oil, forms an excellent anodyne and
    emollient poultice to suppurating tumours.

STEWED SPANISH ONIONS.

1131--INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 Spanish onions, 1 pint of good broth or gravy.

Mode.--Peel the onions, taking care not to cut away too much of the tops or tails, or they
would then fall to pieces; put them into a stewpan capable of holding them at the bottom without
piling them one on the top of another; add the broth or gravy, and simmer very gently until
the onions are perfectly tender. Dish them, pour the gravy round, and serve. Instead of using
broth, Spanish onions may be stewed with a large piece of butter: they must be done very gradually
over a slow fire or hot-plate, and will produce plenty of gravy.

Time.--To stew in gravy, 2 hours, or longer if very large.

Average cost.--medium-sized, 2d. each.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable from September to January.

Note.--Stewed Spanish onions are a favourite accompaniment to roast shoulder of mutton.

    ORIGIN OF THE ONION.--This vegetable is thought to have
    originally come from India, through Egypt, where it became an
    object of worship. Thence it was transmitted to Greece, thence
    to Italy, and ultimately it was distributed throughout Europe,
    in almost every part of which it has, from time immemorial, been
    cultivated. In warm climates it is found to be less acrid and
    much sweeter than in colder latitudes; and in Spain it is not at
    all unusual to see a peasant munching an onion, as an Englishman
    would an apple. Spanish onions, which are imported to this
    country during the winter months, are, when properly roasted,
    perfectly sweet, and equal to many preserves.

BOILED PARSNIPS.

1132. INGREDIENTS.--Parsnips; to each gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.

Mode.--Wash the parsnips, scrape them thoroughly, and, with the point of the knife, remove
any black specks about them, and, should they be very large, cut the thick part into quarters.
Put them into a saucepan of boiling water salted in the above proportion, boil them rapidly
until tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork in them; take them up, drain them,
and serve in a vegetable-dish. This vegetable is usually served with salt fish, boiled pork,
or boiled beef: when sent to table with the latter, a few should be placed alternately with
carrots round the dish, as a garnish.

Time.--Large parsnips, 1 to 1-1/2 hour; small ones, 1/2 to 1 hour.

Average cost, 1d. each.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 for each person.

Seasonable from October to May.

    THE PARSNIP.--This vegetable is found wild in meadows all over
    Europe, and, in England, is met with very frequently on dry
    banks in a chalky soil. In its wild state, the root is white,
    mucilaginous, aromatic, and sweet, with some degree of acrimony:
    when old, it has been known to cause vertigo. Willis relates
    that a whole family fell into delirium from having eaten of its
    roots, and cattle never touch it in its wild state. In domestic
    economy the parsnip is much used, and is found to be a highly
    nutritious vegetable. In times of scarcity, an excellent bread
    has been made from the roots, and they also furnish an excellent
    wine, resembling the malmsey of Madeira and the Canaries: a
    spirit is also obtained from them in as great quantities as from
    carrots. The composition of the parsnip-root has been found to
    be 79.4 of water, 0.9 starch and fibre, 6.1 gum, 5.5 sugar, and
    2.1 of albumen.

BOILED GREEN PEAS.

1133. INGREDIENTS.--Green peas; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 small teaspoonful of moist
sugar, 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.

Mode.--This delicious vegetable, to be eaten in perfection, should be young, and not gathered
or shelled long before it is dressed. Shell the peas, wash them well in cold water, and drain
them; then put them into a saucepan with plenty of fast-boiling water, to which salt and moist
sugar have been added in the above proportion; let them boil quickly over a brisk fire, with
the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and be careful that the smoke does not draw in. When tender,
pour them into a colander; put them into a hot vegetable-dish, and quite in the centre of the
peas place a piece of butter, the size of a walnut. Many cooks boil a small bunch of mint with
the peas, or garnish them with it, by boiling a few sprigs in a saucepan by themselves. Should
the peas be very old, and difficult to boil a good colour, a very tiny piece of soda may be
thrown in the water previous to putting them in; but this must be very sparingly used, as it
causes the peas, when boiled, to have a smashed and broken appearance. With young peas, there
is not the slightest occasion to use it.

Time.--Young peas, 10 to 15 minutes; the large sorts, such as marrowfats, &c., 18 to 24 minutes;
old peas, 1/2 hour.

Average cost, when cheapest, 6d. per peck; when first in season, 1s. to 1s. 6d. per peck.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 peck of unshelled peas for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from June to the end of August.

    ORIGIN OF THE PEA.--All the varieties of garden peas which are
    cultivated have originated from the Pisum sativum, a native of
    the south of Europe; and field peas are varieties of Pisum
    arvense. The Everlasting Pea is Lathyrus latifolius, an old
    favourite in flower-gardens. It is said to yield an abundance of
    honey to bees, which are remarkably fond of it. In this country
    the pea has been grown from time immemorial; but its culture
    seems to have diminished since the more general introduction of
    herbage, plants, and roots.

GREEN PEAS A LA FRANCAISE.

1134. INGREDIENTS.--2 quarts of green peas, 3 oz. of fresh butter, a bunch of parsley, 6 green
onions, flour, a small lump of sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of flour.

Mode.--Shell sufficient fresh-gathered peas to fill 2 quarts; put them into cold water, with
the above proportion of butter, and stir them about until they are well covered with the butter;
drain them in a colander, and put them in a stewpan, with the parsley and onions; dredge over
them a little flour, stir the peas well, and moisten them with boiling water; boil them quickly
over a large fire for 20 minutes, or until there is no liquor remaining. Dip a small lump of
sugar into some water, that it may soon melt; put it with the peas, to which add 1/2 teaspoonful
of salt. Take a piece of butter the size of a walnut, work it together with a teaspoonful of
flour; and add this to the peas, which should be boiling when it is put in. Keep shaking the
stewpan, and, when the peas are nicely thickened, dress them high in the dish, and serve.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from June to the end of August.

    VARIETIES OF THE PEA.--The varieties of the Pea are numerous;
    but they may be divided into two classes--those grown for the
    ripened seed, and those grown for gathering in a green state.
    The culture of the latter is chiefly confined to the
    neighbourhoods of large towns, and may be considered as in part
    rather to belong to the operations of the gardener than to those
    of the agriculturist. The grey varieties are the early grey, the
    late grey, and the purple grey; to which some add the
    Marlborough grey and the horn grey. The white varieties grown in
    fields are the pearl, early Charlton, golden hotspur, the common
    white, or Suffolk, and other Suffolk varieties.

STEWED GREEN PEAS.

1135. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of peas, 1 Lettuce, 1 onion, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to
taste, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.

Mode.--Shell the peas, and cut the onion and lettuce into slices; put these into a stewpan,
with the butter, pepper, and salt, but with no more water than that which hangs round the lettuce
from washing. Stew the whole very gently for rather more than 1 hour; then stir to it a well-beaten
egg, and about 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar. When the peas, &c., are nicely thickened,
serve but, after the egg is added, do not allow them to boil.

Time.--1-1/4 hour. Average cost, 6d. per peck.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable from June to the end of August.

    THE SWEET-PEA AND THE HEATH OR WOOD-PEA.--The well-known
    sweet-pea forms a fine covering to a trellis, or lattice-work in
    a flower-garden. Its gay and fragrant flowers, with its rambling
    habit, render it peculiarly adapted for such a purpose. The
    wood-pea, or heath-pea, is found in the heaths of Scotland, and
    the Highlanders of that country are extremely partial to them,
    and dry and chew them to give a greater relish to their whiskey.
    They also regard them as good against chest complaints, and say
    that by the use of them they are enabled to withstand hunger and
    thirst for a long time. The peas have a sweet taste, somewhat
    like the root of liquorice, and, when boiled, have an agreeable
    flavour, and are nutritive. In times of scarcity they have
    served as an article of food. When well boiled, a fork will pass
    through them; and, slightly dried, they are roasted, and in
    Holland and Flanders served up like chestnuts.

BAKED POTATOES.

1136. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes.

Mode.--Choose large potatoes, as much of a size as possible; wash them in lukewarm water, and
scrub them well, for the browned skin of a baked potato is by many persons considered the better
part of it. Put them into a moderate oven, and bake them for about 2 hours, turning them three
or four times whilst they are cooking. Serve them in a napkin immediately they are done, as,
if kept a long time in the oven, they have a shrivelled appearance. Potatoes may also be roasted
before the fire, in an American oven; but when thus cooked, they must be done very slowly.
Do not forget to send to table with them a piece of cold butter.

Time.--Large potatoes, in a hot oven 1-1/2 hour to 2 hours; in a cool oven, 2 to 2-1/2 hours.

Average cost, 4s. per bushel.

Sufficient.--Allow 2 to each person.

Seasonable all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season.

    POTATO-SUGAR.--This sugary substance, found in the tubers of
    potatoes, is obtained in the form of syrup or treacle, and has
    not yet been crystallized. It resembles the sugar of grapes,
    has a very sweet taste, and may be used for making sweetmeats,
    and as a substitute for honey. Sixty pounds of potatoes,
    yielding eight pounds of dry starch, will produce seven and a
    half pounds of sugar. In Russia it is extensively made, as
    good, though of less consistency than the treacle obtained from
    cane-sugar. A spirit is also distilled from the tubers, which
    resembles brandy, but is milder, and has a flavour as if it were
    charged with the odour of violets or raspberries. In France
    this manufacture is carried on pretty extensively, and five
    hundred pounds of the tubers will produce twelve quarts of
    spirit, the pulp being given to cattle.

TO BOIL POTATOES.

1137. Put them into a saucepan, with sufficient cold water to cover them, with salt in the
above proportion, and let them boil gently until tender. Ascertain when they are done by thrusting
a fork in them, and take them up the moment they feel soft through; for if they are left in
the water afterwards, they become waxy or watery. Drain away the water, put the saucepan by
the side of the fire, with the lid partially uncovered, to allow the steam to escape, and let
the potatoes get thoroughly dry, and do not allow them to get burnt. Their superfluous moisture
will evaporate, and the potatoes, if a good sort, should be perfectly mealy and dry. Potatoes
vary so much in quality and size, that it is difficult to give the exact time for boiling;
they should be attentively watched, and probed with a fork, to ascertain when they are cooked.
Send them to table quickly, and very hot, and with an opening in the cover of the dish, that
a portion of the steam may evaporate, and not fall back on the potatoes.

Time.--Moderate-sized old potatoes, 15 to 20 minutes after the water boils; large ones, 1/2
hour to 35 minutes.

Average cost, 4s. per bushel.

Sufficient for 6 persons.

Seasonable all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season.

Note.--To keep potatoes hot, after draining the water from them, put a folded cloth or flannel
(kept for the purpose) on the top of them, keeping the saucepan-lid partially uncovered. This
will absorb the moisture, and keep them hot some time without spoiling.

    THE POTATO.--The potato belongs to the family of the
    Solanaceae, the greater number of which inhabit the tropics,
    and the remainder are distributed over the temperate regions of
    both hemispheres, but do not extend to the arctic and antarctic
    zones. The whole of the family are suspicious; a great number
    are narcotic, and many are deleterious. The roots partake of the
    properties of the plants, and are sometimes even more active.
    The tubercles of such as produce them, are amylaceous and
    nutritive, as in those of the potato. The leaves are generally
    narcotic; but they lose this principle in boiling, as is the
    case with the Solanum nigrum, which are used as a vegetable
    when cooked.

TO BOIL POTATOES IN THEIR JACKETS.

1138. In Ireland, where, perhaps, the cooking of potatoes is better understood than in any
country, they are always served so. Wash the potatoes well, and if necessary, use a clean scrubbing-brush
to remove the dirt from them; and if possible, choose the potatoes so that they may all be
as nearly the same size as possible. When thoroughly cleansed, fill the saucepan half full
with them, and just cover the potatoes with cold water, salted in the above proportion: they
are more quickly boiled with a small quantity of water, and, besides, are more savoury than
when drowned in it. Bring them to boil, then draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let
them simmer gently until tender. Ascertain when they are done by probing them with a fork;
then pour off the water, uncover the saucepan, and let the potatoes dry by the side of the
fire, taking care not to let them burn. Peel them quickly, put them in a very hot vegetable-dish,
either with or without a napkin, and serve very quickly. After potatoes are cooked, they should
never be entirely covered up, as the steam, instead of escaping, falls down on them, and makes
them watery and insipid. In Ireland they are usually served up with the skins on, and a small
plate is placed by the side of each guest.

Time.--Moderate-sized potatoes, with their skins on, 20 to 25 minutes after the water boils;
large potatoes, 25 minutes to 3/4 hour, or longer; 5 minutes to dry them.

    ANALYSIS OF THE POTATO.--Next to the cereals, the potato is the
    most valuable plant for the production of human food. Its
    tubers, according to analysis conducted by Mr. Fromberg, in the
    laboratory of the Agricultural Chemical Association in Scotland,
    contain the following ingredients:--75.52 per cent. of water,
    15.72 starch, O.55 dextrine, 3.3 of impure saccharine matter,
    and 3.25 of fibre with coagulated albumen. In a dried state the
    tuber contains 64.2 per cent, of starch, 2.25 of dextrine, 13.47
    of impure saccharine matter, 5.77 of caseine, gluten, and
    albumen, 1 of fatty matter, and 13.31 of fibre with coagulated
    albumen.

TO BOIL NEW POTATOES.

1139. Well wash them, rub off the skins with a coarse cloth, and put them into boiling water
salted in the above proportion. If the potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed off, boil
them in their jackets; drain, peel, and serve them as above, with a piece of butter placed
in the midst of them.

Sufficient.--Allow 3 lbs. for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable in May and June, but may be had, forced, in March.

    POTATO STARCH.--This fecula has a beautiful white crystalline
    appearance, and is inodorous, soft to the touch, insoluble in
    cold, but readily soluble in boiling water. It is on this starch
    that the nutritive properties of the tubers depend. As an
    aliment, it is well adapted for invalids and persons of delicate
    constitution. It may be used in the form of arrow-root, and
    eaten with milk or sugar. For pastry of all kinds it is more
    light and easier of digestion than that made with flour of
    wheat. In confectionery it serves to form creams and jellies,
    and in cookery may be used to thicken soups and sauces. It
    accommodates itself to the chest and stomach of children, for
    whom it is well adapted; and it is an aliment that cannot be too
    generally used, as much on account of its wholesomeness as its
    cheapness, and the ease with which it is kept, which are equal,
    if not superior, to all the much-vaunted exotic feculae; as,
    salep, tapioca, sago, and arrow-root.

TO STEAM POTATOES.

1140. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; boiling water.

Mode.--This mode of cooking potatoes is now much in vogue, particularly where they are wanted
on a large scale, it being so very convenient. Pare the potatoes, throw them into cold water
as they are peeled, then put them into a steamer. Place the steamer over a saucepan of boiling
water, and steam the potatoes from 20 to 40 minutes, according to the size and sort. When a
fork goes easily through them, they are done; then take them up, dish, and serve very quickly.

Time.--20 to 40 minutes. Average cost, 4s. per bushel. It is
    generally supposed that the water in which potatoes are boiled
    is injurious; and as instances are recorded where cattle having
    drunk it were seriously affected, it may be well to err on the
    safe side, and avoid its use for any alimentary purpose.
    Potatoes which have been exposed to the air and become green,
    are very unwholesome. Cadet de Vaux asserts that potatoes will
    clean linen as well as soap; and it is well known that the
    berries of the S. saponaceum are used in Peru for the same
    purpose.

HOW TO USE COLD POTATOES.

1141. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold potatoes; to every lb. allow 2 tablespoonfuls of flour,
2 ditto of minced onions, 1 oz. of butter, milk.

Mode.--Mash the potatoes with a fork until perfectly free from lumps; stir in the other ingredients,
and add sufficient milk to moisten them well; press the potatoes into a mould, and bake in
a moderate oven until nicely brown, which will be in from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour. Turn them
out of the mould, and serve.

Time.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour.

Seasonable at any time.

    POTATO BREAD.--The manner in which this is made is very simple.
    The adhesive tendency of the flour of the potato acts against
    its being baked or kneaded without being mixed with wheaten
    flour or meal; it may, however, be made into cakes in the
    following manner:--A small wooden frame, nearly square, is laid
    on a pan like a frying-pan and is grooved, and so constructed
    that, by means of a presser or lid introduced into the groove,
    the cake is at once fashioned, according to the dimensions of
    the mould. The frame containing the farina may be almost
    immediately withdrawn after the mould is formed upon the pan;
    because, from the consistency imparted to the incipient cake by
    the heat, it will speedily admit of being safely handled: it
    must not, however, be fried too hastily. It will then eat very
    palatably, and might from time to time be soaked for puddings,
    like tapioca, or might be used like the cassada-cake, for, when
    well buttered and toasted, it will be found an excellent
    accompaniment to breakfast. In Scotland, cold boiled potatoes
    are frequently squeezed up and mixed with flour or oatmeal, and
    an excellent cake, or scon, obtained.

FRIED POTATOES (French Fashion).

1142. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, hot butter or clarified dripping, salt.

Mode.--Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices, as nearly the same size as possible; make
some butter or dripping quite hot in a frying-pan; put in the potatoes, and fry them on both
sides of a nice brown. When they are crisp and done, take them up, place them on a cloth before
the fire to drain the grease from them, and serve very hot, after sprinkling them with salt.
These are delicious with rump-steak, and, in France, are frequently served thus as a breakfast
dish. The remains of cold potatoes may also be sliced and fried by the above recipe, but the
slices must be cut a little thicker.

Time.--Sliced raw potatoes, 5 minutes; cooked potatoes, 5 minutes.

Average cost, 4s. per bushel.

Sufficient,--6 sliced potatoes for 3 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

A GERMAN METHOD OF COOKING POTATOES.

1143. INGREDIENTS.--8 to 10 middling-sized potatoes, 3 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour,
1/2 pint of broth, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.

Mode.--Put the butter and flour into a stewpan; stir over the fire until the butter is of a
nice brown colour, and add the broth and vinegar; peel and cut the potatoes into long thin
slices, lay them in the gravy, and let them simmer gently until tender, which will be in from
10 to 15 minutes, and serve very hot. A laurel-leaf simmered with the potatoes is an improvement.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes.

Seasonable at any time.

    PRESERVING POTATOES.--In general, potatoes are stored or
    preserved in pits, cellars, pies, or camps; but, whatever mode
    is adopted, it is essential that the tubers be perfectly dry;
    otherwise, they will surely rot; and a few rotten potatoes will
    contaminate a whole mass. The pie, as it is called, consists of
    a trench, lined and covered with straw; the potatoes in it being
    piled in the shape of a house roof, to the height of about three
    feet. The camps are shallow pits, filled and ridged up in a
    similar manner, covered up with the excavated mould of the pit.
    In Russia and Canada, the potato is preserved in boxes, in
    houses or cellars, heated, when necessary, to a temperature one
    or two degrees above the freezing-point, by stoves. To keep
    potatoes for a considerable time, the best way is to place them
    in thin layers on a platform suspended in an ice-cellar: there,
    the temperature being always below that of active vegetation,
    they will not sprout; while, not being above one or two degrees
    below the freezing-point, the tubers will not be frostbitten.
    Another mode is to scoop out the eyes with a very small scoop,
    and keep the roots buried in earth; a third mode is to destroy
    the vital principle, by kiln-drying, steaming, or scalding; a
    fourth is to bury them so deep in dry soil, that no change of
    temperature will reach them; and thus, being without air, they
    will remain upwards of a year without vegetating.

POTATOES A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.

1144. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, salt and water; to every 6 potatoes allow 1 tablespoonful of
minced parsley, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls
of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Wash the potatoes clean, and boil them in salt and water by recipe No. 1138; when they
are done, drain them, let them cool; then peel and cut the potatoes into thick slices: if these
are too thin, they would break in the sauce. Put the butter into a stewpan with the pepper,
salt, gravy, and parsley; mix these ingredients well together, put in the potatoes, shake them
two or three times, that they may be well covered with the sauce, and, when quite hot through,
squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve.

Time.--1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the potatoes; 10 minutes for them to heat in the sauce.

Average cost, 4s. per bushel.

Sufficient for 3 persons. Seasonable all the year.

MASHED POTATOES.

1145. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; to every lb. of mashed potatoes allow 1 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls
of milk, salt to taste.

Mode.--Boil the potatoes in their skins; when done, drain them, and let them get thoroughly
dry by the side of the fire; then peel them, and, as they are peeled, put them into a clean
saucepan, and with a large fork beat them to a light paste; add butter, milk, and salt in the
above proportion, and stir all the ingredients well over the fire. When thoroughly hot, dish
them lightly, and draw the fork backwards over the potatoes to make the surface rough, and
serve. When dressed in this manner, they may be browned at the top with a salamander, or before
the fire. Some cooks press the potatoes into moulds, then turn them out, and brown them in
the oven: this is a pretty mode of serving, but it makes them heavy. In whatever way they are
sent to table, care must be taken to have them quite free from lumps.

Average cost, 4s. per bushel.

Sufficient,--1 lb. of mashed potatoes for 3 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

PUREE DE POMMES DE TERRE, or, Very Thin-mashed Potatoes.

1146. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of mashed potatoes allow 1/4 pint of good broth or stock,
2 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Boil the potatoes, well drain them, and pound them smoothly in a mortar, or beat them
up with a fork; add the stock or broth, and rub the potatoes through a sieve. Put the puree
into a very clean saucepan with the butter; stir it well over the fire until thoroughly hot,
and it will then be ready to serve. A puree should be rather thinner than mashed potatoes,
and is a delicious accompaniment to delicately broiled mutton cutlets. Cream or milk may be
substituted for the broth when the latter is not at hand. A casserole of potatoes, which is
often used for ragoûts instead of rice, is made by mashing potatoes rather thickly, placing
them on a dish, and making an opening in the centre. After having browned the potatoes in the
oven, the dish should be wiped clean, and the ragout or fricassée poured in.

Time.--About 1/2 hour to boil the potatoes; 6 or 7 minutes to warm the purée.

Average cost, 4s. per bushel.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 lb. of cooked potatoes for 3 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    VARIETIES OF THE POTATO.--These are very numerous. "They
    differ," says an authority, "in their leaves and bulk of haulm;
    in the colour of the skin of the tubers; in the colour of the
    interior, compared with that of the skin; in the time of
    ripening; in being farinaceous, glutinous, or watery; in tasting
    agreeably or disagreeably; in cooking readily or tediously; in
    the length of the subterraneous stolones to which the tubers
    are attached; in blossoming or not blossoming; and finally, in
    the soil which they prefer." The earliest varieties grown in
    fields are,--the Early Kidney, the Nonsuch, the Early Shaw, and
    the Early Champion. This last is the most generally cultivated
    round London: it is both mealy and hardy. The sweet potato is
    but rarely eaten in Britain; but in America it is often served
    at table, and is there very highly esteemed.

POTATO RISSOLES.

1147. INGREDIENTS.--Mashed potatoes, salt and pepper to taste; when liked, a very little minced
parsley, egg, and bread crumbs.

Mode.--Boil and mash the potatoes by recipe No. 1145; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and,
when liked, a little minced parsley. Roll the potatoes into small balls, cover them with egg
and bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard for about 10 minutes; let them drain before the fire,
dish them on a napkin, and serve.

Time,--10 minutes to fry the rissoles.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The flavour of these rissoles may be very much increased by adding finely-minced tongue
or ham, or even chopped onions, when these are liked.

    QUALITIES OF POTATOES.--In making a choice from the many
    varieties of potatoes which are everywhere found, the best way
    is to get a sample and taste them, and then fix upon the kind
    which best pleases your palate. The Shaw is one of the most
    esteemed of the early potatoes for field culture; and the Kidney
    and Bread-fruit are also good sorts. The Lancashire Pink is also
    a good potato, and is much cultivated in the neighbourhood of
    Liverpool. As late or long-keeping potatoes, the Tartan or
    Red-apple stands very high in favour.

POTATO SNOW.

1148. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, salt, and water.

Mode.--Choose large white potatoes, as free from spots as possible; boil them in their skins
in salt and water until perfectly tender; drain and dry them thoroughly by the side of the
fire, and peel them. Put a hot dish before the fire, rub the potatoes through a coarse sieve
on to this dish; do not touch them afterwards, or the flakes will fall, and serve as hot as
possible.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE POTATO AS AN ARTICLE OF HUMAN FOOD.--This valuable esculent,
    next to wheat, is of the greatest importance in the eye of the
    political economist. From no other crop that can be cultivated
    does the public derive so much benefit; and it has been
    demonstrated that an acre of potatoes will feed double the
    number of people that can be fed from an acre of wheat.

TO DRESS SALSIFY.

1149.

Mode.--Scrape the roots gently, so as to strip them only of their outside peel; cut them into
pieces about 4 inches long, and, as they are peeled, throw them into water with which has been
mixed a little lemon-juice, to prevent their discolouring. Put them into boiling water, with
salt, butter, and lemon-juice in the above proportion, and let them boil rapidly until tender;
try them with a fork; and, when it penetrates easily, they are done. Drain the salsify, and
serve with a good white sauce or French melted butter.

Time.--30 to 50 minutes. Seasonable in winter.

Note.--This vegetable may be also boiled, sliced, and fried in batter of a nice brown. When
crisp and a good colour, they should be served with fried parsley in the centre of the dish,
and a little fine salt sprinkled over the salsify.

    SALSIFY.--This esculent is, for the sake of its roots,
    cultivated in gardens. It belongs to the Composite class of
    flowers, which is the most extensive family in the vegetable
    kingdom. This family is not only one of the most natural and
    most uniform in structure, but there is also a great similarity
    existing in the properties of the plants of which it is
    composed. Generally speaking, all composite flowers are tonic or
    stimulant in their medical virtues.

BOILED SEA-KALE.

1150. Take it out, drain, untie the bunches, and serve with plain melted butter or white sauce,
a little of which may be poured over the kale. Sea-kale may also be parboiled and stewed in
good brown gravy: it will then take about 1/2 hour altogether.

Time.--15 minutes; when liked very thoroughly done, allow an extra 5 minutes.

Average cost, in full season, 9d. per basket.

Sufficient.--Allow 12 heads for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from February to June.

    SEA-KALE.--This plant belongs to the Asparagus tribe, and grows
    on seashores, especially in the West of England, and in the
    neighbourhood of Dublin. Although it is now in very general use,
    it did not come into repute till 1794. It is easily cultivated,
    and is esteemed as one of the most valuable esculents indigenous
    to Britain. As a vegetable, it is stimulating to the appetite,
    easily digestible, and nutritious. It is so light that the most
    delicate organizations may readily eat it. The flowers form a
    favourite resort for bees, as their petals contain a great
    amount of saccharine matter.

BOILED SALAD.

1151. INGREDIENTS.--2 heads of celery, 1 pint of French beans, lettuce, and endive.

Mode.--Boil the celery and beans separately until tender, and cut the celery into pieces about
2 inches long. Put these into a salad-bowl or dish; pour over either of the sauces No. 506,
507, or 508, and garnish the dish with a little lettuce finely chopped, blanched endive, or
a few tufts of boiled cauliflower. This composition, if less agreeable than vegetables in their
raw state, is more wholesome; for salads, however they may be compounded, when eaten uncooked,
prove to some people indigestible. Tarragon, chervil, burnet, and boiled onion, may be added
to the above salad with advantage, as also slices of cold meat, poultry, or fish.

Seasonable from July to October.

    ACETARIOUS VEGETABLES.--By the term Acetarious vegetables, is
    expressed a numerous class of plants, of various culture and
    habit, which are principally used as salads, pickles, and
    condiments. They are to be considered rather as articles of
    comparative luxury than as ordinary food, and are more desirable
    for their coolness, or their agreeable flavour, than for their
    nutritive powers.

    CAULIFLOWER.--The cauliflower is less indigestible than the
    cabbage; it possesses a most agreeable flavour, and is
    sufficiently delicate to be served at the tables of the wealthy.
    It is a wholesome vegetable, but should be eaten moderately, as
    it induces flatulence. Persons of weak constitutions and
    delicate stomachs should abstain from cauliflower as much as
    possible. They may be prepared in a variety of ways; and, in
    selecting them, the whitest should be chosen; those tinged with
    green or yellow being of indifferent quality.

SUMMER SALAD.

1152. INGREDIENTS.--3 lettuces, 2 handfuls of mustard-and-cress, 10 young radishes, a few slices
of cucumber.

Mode.--Let the herbs be as fresh as possible for a salad, and, if at all stale or dead-looking,
let them lie in water for an hour or two, which will very much refresh them. Wash and carefully
pick them over, remove any decayed or wormeaten leaves, and drain them thoroughly by swinging
them gently in a clean cloth. With a silver knife, cut the lettuces into small pieces, and
the radishes and cucumbers into thin slices; arrange all these ingredients lightly on a dish,
with the mustard-and-cress, and pour under, but not over the salad, either of the sauces No.
506, 507, or 508, and do not stir it up until it is to be eaten. It may be garnished with hard-boiled
eggs, cut in slices, sliced cucumbers, nasturtiums, cut vegetable-flowers, and many other things
that taste will always suggest to make a pretty and elegant dish. In making a good salad, care
must be taken to have the herbs freshly gathered, and thoroughly drained before the sauce is
added to them, or it will be watery and thin. Young spring onions, cut small, are by many persons
considered an improvement to salads; but, before these are added, the cook should always consult
the taste of her employer. Slices of cold meat or poultry added to a salad make a convenient
and quickly-made summer luncheon-dish; or cold fish, flaked, will also be found exceedingly
nice, mixed with it.

Average cost, 9d. for a salad for 5 or 6 persons; but more expensive when the herbs are forced.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from May to September.

    CUCUMBERS.--The cucumber is refreshing, but neither nutritious
    nor digestible, and should be excluded from the regimen of the
    delicate. There are various modes of preparing cucumbers. When
    gathered young, they are called gherkins: these, pickled, are
    much used in seasonings.

    RADISHES.--This is the common name given to the root of the
    Raphanus satious, one of the varieties of the cultivated
    horseradish. There are red and white radishes; and the French
    have also what they call violet and black ones, of which the
    black are the larger. Radishes are composed of nearly the same
    constituents as turnips, that is to say, mostly fibre and
    nitrogen; and, being generally eaten raw, it is on the last of
    these that their flavour depends. They do not agree with people,
    except those who are in good health, and have active digestive
    powers; for they are difficult of digestion, and cause
    flatulency and wind, and are the cause of headaches when eaten
    to excess. Besides being eaten raw, they are sometimes, but
    rarely, boiled; and they also serve as a pretty garnish for
    salads. In China, the radish may be found growing naturally,
    without cultivation; and may be occasionally met with in England
    as a weed, in similar places to where the wild turnip grows; it,
    however, thrives best in the garden, and the ground it likes
    best is a deep open loam, or a well-manured sandy soil.

WINTER SALAD.

1153. INGREDIENTS.--Endive, mustard-and-cress, boiled beetroot, 3 or 4 hard-boiled eggs, celery.

Mode.--The above ingredients form the principal constituents of a winter salad, and may be
converted into a very pretty dish, by nicely contrasting the various colours, and by tastefully
garnishing it. Shred the celery into thin pieces, after having carefully washed and cut away
all wormeaten pieces; cleanse the endive and mustard-and-cress free from grit, and arrange
these high in the centre of a salad-bowl or dish; garnish with the hard-boiled eggs and beetroot,
both of which should be cut in slices; and pour into the dish, but not over the salad, either
of the sauces No. 506, 507, or 508. Never dress a salad long before it is required for table,
as, by standing, it loses its freshness and pretty crisp and light appearance; the sauce, however,
may always be prepared a few hours beforehand, and when required for use, the herbs laid lightly
over it.

Average cost, 9d. for a salad for 5 or 6 persons.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from the end of September to March.

    SALADS.--Salads are raw vegetables, of which, among us, the
    lettuce is the most generally used; several others, however,
    such as cresses, celery, onions, beetroot, &c., are occasionally
    employed. As vegetables eaten in a raw state are apt to ferment
    on the stomach, and as they have very little stimulative power
    upon that organ, they are usually dressed with some condiments,
    such as pepper, vinegar, salt, mustard, and oil. Respecting the
    use of these, medical men disagree, especially in reference to
    oil, which is condemned by some and recommended by others.

POTATO SALAD.

1154. INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 cold boiled potatoes, 4 tablespoonfuls of tarragon or plain vinegar,
6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley.

Mode.--Cut the potatoes into slices about 1/2 inch in thickness; put these into a salad-bowl
with oil and vinegar in the above proportion; season with pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful of
minced parsley; stir the salad well, that all the ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated,
and it is ready to serve. This should be made two or three hours before it is wanted for table.
Anchovies, olives, or pickles may be added to this salad, as also slices of cold beef, fowl,
or turkey.

Seasonable at any time.

CHICKEN SALAD.--(See No. 931.)

GROUSE SALAD.--(See No. 1020.)

LOBSTER SALAD.--(See No. 272.)

TO BOIL SPINACH (English Mode).

1155. INGREDIENTS.--2 pailfuls of spinach, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls of salt, 1 oz. of butter,
pepper to taste.

Mode.--Pick the spinach carefully, and see that no stalks or weeds are left amongst it; wash
it in several waters, and, to prevent it being gritty, act in the following manner:--Have ready
two large pans or tubs filled with water; put the spinach into one of these, and thoroughly
wash it; then, with the hands, take out the spinach, and put it into the other tub of water
(by this means all the grit will be left at the bottom of the tub); wash it again, and, should
it not be perfectly free from dirt, repeat the process. Put it into a very large saucepan,
with about 1/2 pint of water, just sufficient to keep the spinach from burning, and the above
proportion of salt. Press it down frequently with a wooden spoon, that it may be done equally;
and when it has boiled for rather more than 10 minutes, or until it is perfectly tender, drain
it in a colander, squeeze it quite dry, and chop it finely. Put the spinach into a clean stewpan,
with the butter and a seasoning of pepper; stir the whole over the fire until quite hot; then
put it on a hot dish, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach, 5 minutes to warm with the butter.

Average cost for the above quantity, 8d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable.--Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from November to March.

Note.--Grated nutmeg, pounded mace, or lemon-juice may also be added to enrich the flavour;
and poached eggs are also frequently served with spinach: they should be placed on the top
of it, and it should be garnished with sippets of toasted bread.--See coloured plate U.

    VARIETIES OF SPINACH.--These comprise the Strawberry spinach,
    which, under that name, was wont to be grown in our
    flower-gardens; the Good King Harry, the Garden Oracle, the
    Prickly, and the Round, are the varieties commonly used. The
    Oracle is a hardy sort, much esteemed in France, and is a native
    of Tartary, introduced in 1548. The common spinach has its
    leaves round, and is softer and more succulent than any of the
    Brassica tribe.

SPINACH DRESSED WITH CREAM, a la Francaise.

1156. INGREDIENTS.--2 pailfuls of spinach, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt, 2 oz. of butter, 8 tablespoonfuls
of cream, 1 small teaspoonful of pounded sugar, a very little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Boil and drain the spinach as in recipe No. 1155; chop it finely, and put it into a
stewpan with the butter; stir over a gentle fire, and, when the butter has dried away, add
the remaining ingredients, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Previously to adding the cream,
boil it first, in case it should curdle. Serve on a hot dish, and garnish either with sippets
of toasted bread or leaves of puff-paste.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach; 10 minutes to stew with the cream.

    SPINACH.--This is a Persian plant. It has been cultivated in our
    gardens about two hundred years, and is the most wholesome of
    vegetables. It is not very nutritious, but is very easily
    digested. It is very light and laxative. Wonderful properties
    have been ascribed to spinach. It is an excellent vegetable, and
    very beneficial to health. Plainly dressed, it is a resource for
    the poor; prepared luxuriantly, it is a choice dish for the
    rich.

    SPINACH.--This vegetable belongs to a sub-order of the
    Salsolaceae, or saltworts, and is classified under the head of
    Spirolobeae, with leaves shaped like worms, and of a succulent
    kind. In its geographical distribution it is commonly found in
    extratropical and temperate regions, where they grow as weeds in
    waste places, and among rubbish, and in marshes by the seashore.
    In the tropics the order is rarely found. Many of them are used
    as potherbs, and some of them are emetic and vermifuge in their
    medicinal properties.

FRENCH MODE OF DRESSING SPINACH.

1157.

Mode.--Pick, wash, and boil the spinach, as in recipe No. 1155, and when quite tender, drain
and squeeze it perfectly dry from the water that hangs about it. Chop it very fine, put the
butter into a stewpan, and lay the spinach over that; stir it over a gentle fire, and dredge
in the flour. Add the gravy, and let it boil quickly for a few minutes, that it may not discolour.
When the flavour of nutmeg is liked, grate some to the spinach, and when thoroughly hot, and
the gravy has dried away a little, serve.

Note.--For an entremets or second-course dish, spinach, dressed by the above recipe may be
pressed into a hot mould; it should then be turned out quickly, and served very hot.

BAKED TOMATOES.

(Excellent.)

1158. INGREDIENTS.--8 or 10 tomatoes, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz. of butter, bread crumbs.

Mode.--Take off the stalks from the tomatoes; cut them into thick slices, and put them into
a deep baking-dish; add a plentiful seasoning of pepper and salt, and butter in the above proportion;
cover the whole with bread crumbs; drop over these a little clarified butter; bake in a moderate
oven from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, and serve very hot. This vegetable, dressed as above, is
an exceedingly nice accompaniment to all kinds of roast meat. The tomatoes, instead of being
cut in slices, may be baked whole; but they will take rather longer time to cook.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable in August, September, and October; but may be had, forced, much earlier.

    TOMATOES.--The Tomato is a native of tropical countries, but is
    now cultivated considerably both in France and England. Its skin
    is of a brilliant red, and its flavour, which is somewhat sour,
    has become of immense importance in the culinary art. It is used
    both fresh and preserved. When eaten fresh, it is served as an
    entremets; but its principal use is in sauce and gravy; its
    flavour stimulates the appetite, and is almost universally
    approved. The Tomato is a wholesome fruit, and digests easily.
    From July to September, they gather the tomatoes green in
    France, not breaking them away from the stalk; they are then
    hung, head downwards, in a dry and not too cold place; and there
    they ripen.

HOT TOMATO SAUCE, or PUREE OF TOMATOES.

(See No. 529.)

STEWED TOMATOES.

I.

1159. INGREDIENTS.--8 tomatoes, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar.

Mode.--Slice the tomatoes into a lined saucepan; season them with pepper and salt, and place
small pieces of butter on them. Cover the lid down closely, and stew from 20 to 25 minutes,
or until the tomatoes are perfectly tender; add the vinegar, stir two or three times, and serve
with any kind of roast meat, with which they will be found a delicious accompaniment.

Seasonable from August to October; but may be had, forced, much earlier.

    ANALYSIS OF THE TOMATO.--The fruit of the love-apple is the only
    part used as an esculent, and it has been found to contain a
    particular acid, a volatile oil, a brown, very fragrant
    extracto-resinous matter, a vegeto-mineral matter,
    muco-saccharine, some salts, and, in all probability, an
    alkaloid. The whole plant has a disagreeable odour, and its
    juice, subjected to the action of the fire, emits a vapour so
    powerful as to cause vertigo and vomiting.

II.

1160. INGREDIENTS.--8 tomatoes, about 1/2 pint of good gravy, thickening of butter and flour,
cayenne and salt to taste.

Mode.--Take out the stalks of the tomatoes; put them into a wide stewpan, pour over them the
above proportion of good brown gravy, and stew gently until they are tender, occasionally carefully
turning them, that they may be equally done. Thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour
worked together on a plate; let it just boil up after the thickening is added, and serve. If
it be at hand, these should be served on a silver or plated vegetable-dish.

Time.--20 to 25 minutes, very gentle stewing.

    THE TOMATO, OR LOVE-APPLE.--This vegetable is a native of Mexico
    and South America, but is also found in the East Indies, where
    it is supposed to have been introduced by the Spaniards. In this
    country it is much more cultivated than it formerly was; and the
    more the community becomes acquainted with the many agreeable
    forms in which the fruit can be prepared, the more widely will
    its cultivation be extended. For ketchup, soups, and sauces, it
    is equally applicable, and the unripe fruit makes one of the
    best pickles.

TRUFFLES AU NATUREL.

1161. INGREDIENTS.--Truffles, buttered paper.

Mode.--Select some fine truffles; cleanse them, by washing them in several waters with a brush,
until not a particle of sand or grit remains on them; wrap each truffle in buttered paper,
and bake in a hot oven for quite an hour; take off the paper, wipe the truffles, and serve
them in a hot napkin.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost.--Not often bought in this country.

Seasonable from November to March.

    THE COMMON TRUFFLE.--This is the Tuber cibarium of science,
    and belongs to that numerous class of esculent fungi
    distinguished from other vegetables not only by the singularity
    of their forms, but by their chemical composition. Upon
    analysis, they are found not only to contain the usual
    components of the vegetable kingdom, such as carbon, oxygen, and
    hydrogen, but likewise a large proportion of nitrogen; from
    which they approach more nearly to the nature of animal flesh.
    It was long ago observed by Dr. Darwin, that all the mushrooms
    cooked at our tables, as well as those used for ketchup,
    possessed an animal flavour; and soup enriched by mushrooms only
    has sometimes been supposed to contain meat.

TO DRESS TRUFFLES WITH CHAMPAGNE.

1162. INGREDIENTS.--12 fine black truffles, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 carrot, 1 turnip,
2 onions, a bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1 bay-leaf, 2 cloves, 1 blade of pounded
mace, 2 glasses of champagne, 1/2 pint of stock.

Mode.--Carefully select the truffles, reject those that have a musty smell, and wash them well
with a brush, in cold water only, until perfectly clean. Put the bacon into a stewpan, with
the truffles and the remaining ingredients; simmer these gently for an hour, and let the whole
cool in the stewpan. When to be served, rewarm them, and drain them on a clean cloth; then
arrange them on a delicately white napkin, that it may contrast as strongly as possible with
the truffles, and serve.

    THE TRUFFLE.--The Truffle belongs to the family of the Mushroom.
    It is certain that the truffle must possess, equally with other
    plants, organs of reproduction; yet, notwithstanding all the
    efforts of art and science, it has been impossible to subject it
    to a regular culture. Truffles grow at a considerable depth
    under the earth, never appearing on the surface. They are found
    in many parts of France: those of Périgord Magny are the most
    esteemed for their odour. There are three varieties of the
    species,--the black, the red, and the white: the latter are of
    little value. The red are very rare, and their use is
    restricted. The black has the highest repute, and its
    consumption is enormous. When the peasantry go to gather
    truffles, they take a pig with them to scent out the spot where
    they grow. When that is found, the pig turns up the surface with
    his snout, and the men then dig until they find the truffles.
    Good truffles are easily distinguished by their agreeable
    perfume; they should be light in proportion to their size, and
    elastic when pressed by the finger. To have them in perfection,
    they should be quite fresh, as their aroma is considerably
    diminished by any conserving process. Truffles are stimulating
    and beating. Weak stomachs digest them with difficulty. Some of
    the culinary uses to which they are subjected render them more
    digestible; but they should always be eaten sparingly. Their
    chief use is in seasoning and garnitures. In short, a professor
    has said, "Meats with truffles are the most distinguished dishes
    that opulence can offer to the epicure." The Truffle grows in
    clusters, some inches below the surface of the soil, and is of
    an irregular globular form. Those which grow wild in England are
    about the size of a hen's egg, and have no roots. As there is
    nothing to indicate the places where they are, dogs have been
    trained to discriminate their scent, by which they are
    discovered. Hogs are very fond of them, and frequently lead to
    their being found, from their rutting up the ground in search of
    them.

ITALIAN MODE OF DRESSING TRUFFLES.

1163. INGREDIENTS.--10 truffles, 1/4 pint of salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, a very little finely-minced garlic, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon-juice.

Mode.--After cleansing and brushing the truffles, cut them into thin slices, and put them in
a baking-dish, on a seasoning of oil, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic, and mace in the above
proportion.

    WHERE TRUFFLES ARE FOUND.--In this country, the common truffle
    is found on the downs of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Kent; and
    they abound in dry light soils, and more especially in oak and
    chestnut forests. In France they are plentiful, and many are
    imported from the south of that country and Italy, where they
    are much larger and in greater perfection: they lose, however,
    much of their flavour by drying. Truffles have in England been
    tried to be propagated artificially, but without success.

TRUFFLES A L'ITALIENNE.

1164. INGREDIENTS.--10 truffles, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 1 minced shalot, salt and
pepper to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of good brown gravy, the juice of 1/2 lemon,
cayenne to taste.

Mode.--Wash the truffles and cut them into slices about the size of a penny-piece; put them
into a sauté pan, with the parsley, shalot, salt, pepper, and 1 oz. of butter; stir them over
the fire, that they may all be equally done, which will be in about 10 minutes, and drain off
some of the butter; then add a little more fresh butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of good gravy, the
juice of 1/2 lemon, and a little cayenne; stir over the fire until the whole is on the point
of boiling, when serve.

Time.--Altogether, 20 minutes. They
    are likewise dried for the winter months, and, when reduced to
    powder, form a useful culinary ingredient; they, however, have
    many virtues attributed to them which they do not possess. Their
    wholesomeness is, perhaps, questionable, and they should be
    eaten with moderation.

BOILED TURNIPS.

1165. Put them into a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion, and let them
boil gently until tender. Try them with a fork, and, when done, take them up in a colander;
let them thoroughly drain, and serve. Boiled turnips are usually sent to table with boiled
mutton, but are infinitely nicer when mashed than served whole: unless nice and young, they
are scarcely worth the trouble of dressing plainly as above.

Time.--Old turnips, 3/4 to 1-1/4 hour; young ones, about 18 to 20 minutes.

Average cost, 4d. per bunch.

Sufficient.--Allow a bunch of 12 turnips for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable.--May be had all the year; but in spring only useful for flavouring gravies, &c.

    THE TURNIP.--This vegetable is the Brassica Rapa of science,
    and grows wild in England, but cannot be brought exactly to
    resemble what it becomes in a cultivated state. It is said to
    have been originally introduced from Hanover, and forms an
    excellent culinary vegetable, much used all over Europe, where
    it is either eaten alone or mashed and cooked in soups and
    stews. They do not thrive in a hot climate; for in India they,
    and many more of our garden vegetables, lose their flavour and
    become comparatively tasteless. The Swede is the largest
    variety, but it is too coarse for the table.

MASHED TURNIPS.

1166.

Mode.--Pare the turnips, quarter them, and put them into boiling water, salted in the above
proportion; boil them until tender; then drain them in a colander, and squeeze them as dry
as possible by pressing them with the back of a large plate. When quite free from water, rub
the turnips with a wooden spoon through the colander, and put them into a very clean saucepan;
add the butter, white pepper, or cayenne, and, if necessary, a little salt. Keep stirring them
over the fire until the butter is well mixed with them, and the turnips are thoroughly hot;
dish, and serve. A little cream or milk added after the turnips are pressed through the colander,
is an improvement to both the colour and flavour of this vegetable.

Time.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the turnips; 10 minutes to warm them through.

Average cost, 4d. per bunch.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable.--May be had all the year; but in spring only good for flavouring gravies.

    VEGETABLES REDUCED TO PURÉE.--Persons in the flower of youth,
    having healthy stomachs, and leading active lives, may eat all
    sorts of vegetables, without inconvenience, save, of course, in
    excess. The digestive functions possess great energy during the
    period of youth: the body, to develop itself, needs nourishment.
    Physical exercise gives an appetite, which it is necessary to
    satisfy, and vegetables cannot resist the vigorous action of the
    gastric organs. As old proverb says, "At twenty one can digest
    iron." But for aged persons, the sedentary, or the delicate, it
    is quite otherwise. Then the gastric power has considerably
    diminished, the digestive organs have lost their energy, the
    process of digestion is consequently slower, and the least
    excess at table is followed by derangement of the stomach for
    several days. Those who generally digest vegetables with
    difficulty, should eat them reduced to a pulp or purée, that is
    to say, with their skins and tough fibres removed. Subjected to
    this process, vegetables which, when entire, would create
    flatulence and wind, are then comparatively harmless. Experience
    has established the rule, that nourishment is not complete
    without the alliance of meat with vegetables. We would also add,
    that the regime most favourable to health is found in variety:
    variety pleases the senses, monotony is disagreeable. The eye is
    fatigued by looking always on one object, the ear by listening
    to one sound, and the palate by tasting one flavour. It is the
    same with the stomach: consequently, variety of food is one of
    the essentials for securing good digestion.

GERMAN MODE OF COOKING TURNIPS.

1167. Toss them over the fire for a few minutes, then add the broth, and simmer the whole gently
till the turnips are tender. Brown the above proportion of flour with a little butter; add
this to the turnips, let them simmer another 5 minutes, and serve. Boiled mutton is usually
sent to table with this vegetable, and may be cooked with the turnips by placing it in the
midst of them: the meat would then be very delicious, as, there being so little liquid with
the turnips, it would almost be steamed, and consequently very tender.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost, 4d. per bunch.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable.--May be had all the year.

    TURNIPS.--Good turnips are delicate in texture, firm, and sweet.
    The best sorts contain a sweet juicy mucilage, uniting with the
    aroma a slightly acid quality, which is completely neutralized
    in cooking. The turnip is prepared in a variety of ways. Ducks
    stuffed with turnips have been highly appreciated. It is useful
    in the regimen of persons afflicted with chronic visceral
    irritations. The turnip only creates flatulency when it is soft,
    porous, and stringy. It is then, consequently, bad.

TURNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE.

(An Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course as a Side-dish.)

1168. INGREDIENTS.--7 or 8 turnips, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of white sauce, No. 538 or 539.

Mode.--Peel and cut the turnips in the shape of pears or marbles; boil them in salt and water,
to which has been added a little butter, until tender; then take them out, drain, arrange them
on a dish, and pour over the white sauce made by recipe No. 538 or 539, and to which has been
added a small lump of sugar. In winter, when other vegetables are scarce, this will be found
a very good and pretty-looking dish: when approved, a little mustard may be added to the sauce.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to boil the turnips.

Average cost, 4d. per bunch.

Sufficient for 1 side-dish. Seasonable in winter.

    THE FRENCH NAVET.--This is a variety of the turnip; but, instead
    of being globular, has more the shape of the carrot. Its flavour
    being excellent, it is much esteemed on the Continent for soups
    and made dishes. Two or three of them will impart as much
    flavour as a dozen of the common turnips will. Accordingly, when
    stewed in gravy, they are greatly relished. This flavour resides
    in the rind, which is not cut off, but scraped. This variety was
    once grown in England, but now it is rarely found in our
    gardens, though highly deserving of a place there. It is of a
    yellowish-white colour, and is sometimes imported to the London
    market.

BOILED TURNIP GREENS.

1169.

Mode.--Wash the greens well in two or three waters, and pick off all the decayed and dead leaves;
tie them in small bunches, and put them into plenty of boiling water, salted in the above proportion.
Keep them boiling quickly, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and when tender, pour them
into a colander; let them drain, arrange them in a vegetable-dish, remove the string that the
greens were tied with, and serve.

Time.--15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, 4d. for a dish for 3 persons.

Seasonable in March, April, and May.

    CABBAGE, TURNIP-TOPS, AND GREENS.--All the cabbage tribe, which
    comprises coleworts, brocoli, cauliflower, sprouts, and
    turnip-tops, in order to be delicate, should be dressed young,
    when they have a rapid growth; but, if they have stood the
    summer, in order to be tender, they should be allowed to have a
    touch of frost. The cabbage contains much vegetable albumen, and
    several parts sulphur and nitrate of potass. Cabbage is heavy,
    and a long time digesting, which has led to a belief that it is
    very nourishing. It is only fit food for robust and active
    persons; the sedentary or delicate should carefully avoid it.
    Cabbage may be prepared in a variety of ways: it serves as a
    garniture to several recherché dishes,--partridge and cabbage
    for example. Bacon and cabbage is a very favourite dish; but
    only a good stomach can digest it.

BOILED VEGETABLE MARROW.

1170.

Mode.--Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion; put in the marrows
after peeling them, and boil them until quite tender. Take them up with a slice, halve, and,
should they be very large, quarter them. Dish them on toast, and send to table with them a
tureen of melted butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of salt butter. Large vegetable marrows
may be preserved throughout the winter by storing them in a dry place; when wanted for use,
a few slices should be cut and boiled in the same manner as above; but, when once begun, the
marrow must be eaten quickly, as it keeps but a short time after it is cut. Vegetable marrows
are also very delicious mashed: they should be boiled, then drained, and mashed smoothly with
a wooden spoon. Heat them in a saucepan, add a seasoning of salt and pepper, and a small piece
of butter, and dish with a few sippets of toasted bread placed round as a garnish.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 moderate-sized marrow for each person.

Seasonable in July, August, and September; but may be preserved all the winter.

FRIED VEGETABLE MARROW.

1171. INGREDIENTS.--3 medium-sized vegetable marrows, egg and bread crumbs, hot lard.

Mode.--Peel, and boil the marrows until tender in salt and water; then drain them and cut them
in quarters, and take out the seeds. When thoroughly drained, brush the marrows over with egg,
and sprinkle with bread crumbs; have ready some hot lard, fry the marrow in this, and, when
of a nice brown, dish; sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, and serve.

Time.--About 1/2 hour to boil the marrow, 7 minutes to fry it.

Average cost, in full season, 1s. per dozen.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable in July, August, and September.

    THE VEGETABLE MARROW.--This vegetable is now extensively used,
    and belongs to the Cucurbits. It is the C. ovifera of science,
    and, like the melon, gourd, cucumber, and squash, is widely
    diffused in the tropical or warmer regions of the globe. Of the
    nature of this family we have already spoken when treating of
    the cucumber.

CUT VEGETABLES FOR SOUPS, &c.

1172. The annexed engraving represents a cutter for shaping vegetables for soups, ragouts,
stews, &c.; carrots and turnips being the usual vegetables for which this utensil is used.
Cut the vegetables into slices about 1/4 inch in thickness, stamp them out with the cutter,
and boil them for a few minutes in salt and water, until tender. Turnips should be cut in rather
thicker slices than carrots, on account of the former boiling more quickly to a pulp than the
latter.

    CARROTS.--Several species of carrots are cultivated,--the red,
    the yellow, and the which. Those known as the Crecy carrots are
    considered the best, and are very sweet. The carrot has been
    classed by hygienists among flatulent vegetables, and as
    difficult of digestion. When the root becomes old, it is almost
    as hard as wood; but the young carrot, which has not reached its
    full growth, is tender, relishing, nutritious, and digests well
    when properly cooked.

VEGETABLE MARROWS IN WHITE SAUCE.

1173. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 moderate-sized marrows, 1/2 pint of white sauce, No. 539.

Mode.--Pare the marrows; cut them in halves, and shape each half at the top in a point, leaving
the bottom end flat for it to stand upright in the dish. Boil the marrows in salt and water
until tender; take them up very carefully, and arrange them on a hot dish.

Time.--From 15 to 20 minutes to boil the marrows.

Average cost, in full season, 1s. per dozen.

BOILED INDIAN WHEAT or MAIZE.

1174. Our sun, it is true, possesses hardly power sufficient to ripen maize; but, with well-prepared
ground, and in a favourable position, it might be sufficiently advanced by the beginning of
autumn to serve as a vegetable. The outside sheath being taken off and the waving fibres removed,
let the ears be placed in boiling water, where they should remain for about 25 minutes (a longer
time may be necessary for larger ears than ordinary); and, when sufficiently boiled and well
drained, they may be sent to table whole, and with a piece of toast underneath them. Melted
butter should be served with them.

Time.--25 to 35 minutes. Average cost.--Seldom bought.

Sufficient,--1 ear for each person. Seasonable in autumn.

Note.--William Cobbett, the English radical writer and politician, was a great cultivator and
admirer of maize, and constantly ate it as a vegetable, boiled. We believe he printed a special
recipe for it, but we have been unable to lay our hands on it. Mr. Buchanan, the present president
of the United States, was in the habit, when ambassador here, of receiving a supply of Indian
corn from America in hermetically-sealed cases; and the publisher of this work remembers, with
considerable satisfaction, his introduction to a dish of this vegetable, when in America. He
found it to combine the excellences of the young green pea and the finest asparagus; but he
felt at first slightly awkward in holding the large ear with one hand, whilst the other had
to be employed in cutting off with a knife the delicate green grains.

CHAPTER XXVI.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND PASTRY.

1175. PUDDINGS AND PASTRY, familiar as they may be, and unimportant as they may be held in
the estimation of some, are yet intimately connected with the development of agricultural resources
in reference to the cereal grasses. When they began to be made is uncertain; but we may safely
presume, that a simple form of pudding was amongst the first dishes made after discovering
a mode of grinding wheat into flour. Traditional history enables us to trace man back to the
time of the Deluge. After that event he seems to have recovered himself in the central parts
of Asia, and to have first risen to eminence in the arts of civilization on the banks of the
Nile. From this region, Greece, Carthage, and some other parts along the shores of the Mediterranean
Sea, were colonized. In process of time, Greece gave to the Romans the arts which she had thus
received from Egypt, and these subsequently diffused them over Europe. How these were carried
to or developed in India and China, is not so well ascertained; and in America their ancient
existence rests only on very indistinct traditions. As to who was the real discoverer of the
use of corn, we have no authentic knowledge. The traditions of different countries ascribe
it to various fabulous personages, whose names it is here unnecessary to introduce. In Egypt,
however, corn must have grown abundantly; for Abraham, and after him Jacob, had recourse to
that country for supplies during times of famine.

1176. THE HABITS OF A PEOPLE, to a great extent, are formed by the climate in which they live,
and by the native or cultivated productions in which their country abounds. Thus we find that
the agricultural produce of the ancient Egyptians is pretty much the same as that of the present
day, and the habits of the people are not materially altered. In Greece, the products cultivated
in antiquity were the same kinds of grains and legumes as are cultivated at present, with the
vine, the fig, the olive, the apple, and other fruits. So with the Romans, and so with other
nations. As to the different modes of artificially preparing those to please the taste, it
is only necessary to say that they arise from the universal desire of novelty, characteristic
of man in the development of his social conditions. Thus has arisen the whole science of cookery,
and thus arose the art of making puddings. The porridge of the Scotch is nothing more than
a species of hasty pudding, composed of oatmeal, salt, and water; and the "red pottage" for
which Esau sold his birthright, must have been something similar. The barley-gruel of the Lacedaemonians,
of the Athenian gladiators and common people, was the same, with the exception of the slight
seasoning it had beyond the simplicity of Scottish fare. Here is the ancient recipe for the
Athenian national dish:--"Dry near the fire, in the oven, twenty pounds of barley-flour; then
parch it; add three pounds of linseed-meal, half a pound of coriander-seed, two ounces of salt,
and the quantity of water necessary." To this sometimes a little millet was added, in order
to give the paste greater cohesion and delicacy.

1177. OATMEAL AMONGST THE GREEKS AND ROMANS was highly esteemed, as was also rice, which they
considered as beneficial to the chest. They also held in high repute the Irion, or Indian wheat
of the moderns. The flour of this cereal was made into a kind of hasty pudding, and, parched
or roasted, as eaten with a little salt. The Spelt, or Red wheat, was likewise esteemed, and
its flour formed the basis of the Carthaginian pudding, for which we here give the scientific
recipe:--"Put a pound of red-wheat flour into water, and when it has steeped some time, transfer
it to a wooden bowl. Add three pounds of cream cheese, half a pound of honey, and one egg.
Beat the whole together, and cook it on a slow fire in a stewpan." Should this be considered
unpalatable, another form has been recommended. "Sift the flour, and, with some water, put
it into a wooden vessel, and, for ten days, renew the water twice each day. At the end of that
period, press out the water and place the paste in another vessel. It is now to be reduced
to the consistence of thick lees, and passed through a piece of new linen. Repeat this last
operation, then dry the mass in the sun and boil it in milk. Season according to taste." These
are specimens of the puddings of antiquity, and this last recipe was held in especial favour
by the Romans.

1178. HOWEVER GREAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE QUALIFICATIONS of the ancients, however, in the art of
pudding-making, we apprehend that such preparations as gave gratification to their palates,
would have generally found little favour amongst the insulated inhabitants of Great Britain.
Here, from the simple suet dumpling up to the most complicated Christmas production, the grand
feature of substantiality is primarily attended to. Variety in the ingredients, we think, is
held only of secondary consideration with the great body of the people, provided that the whole
is agreeable and of sufficient abundance.

1179. ALTHOUGH FROM PUDDINGS TO PASTRY is but a step, it requires a higher degree of art to
make the one than to make the other. Indeed, pastry is one of the most important branches of
the culinary science. It unceasingly occupies itself with ministering pleasure to the sight
as well as to the taste; with erecting graceful monuments, miniature fortresses, and all kinds
of architectural imitations, composed of the sweetest and most agreeable products of all climates
and countries. At a very early period, the Orientals were acquainted with the art of manipulating
in pastry; but they by no means attained to the taste, variety, and splendour of design, by
which it is characterized amongst the moderns. At first it generally consisted of certain mixtures
of flour, oil, and honey, to which it was confined for centuries, even among the southern nations
of the European continent. At the commencement of the middle ages, a change began to take place
in the art of mixing it. Eggs, butter, and salt came into repute in the making of paste, which
was forthwith used as an inclosure for meat, seasoned with spices. This advance attained, the
next step was to inclose cream, fruit, and marmalades; and the next, to build pyramids and
castles; when the summit of the art of the pastry-cook may be supposed to have been achieved.

DIRECTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAKING OF PUDDINGS AND PASTRY.

1180. A few general remarks respecting the various ingredients of which puddings and pastry
are composed, may be acceptable as preliminary to the recipes in this department of Household
Management.

1181. Flour should be of the best quality, and perfectly dry, and sifted before being used;
if in the least damp, the paste made from it will certainly be heavy.

1182. Butter, unless fresh is used, should be washed from the salt, and well squeezed and wrung
in a cloth, to get out all the water and buttermilk, which, if left in, assists to make the
paste heavy.

1183. Lard should be perfectly sweet, which may be ascertained by cutting the bladder through,
and, if the knife smells sweet, the lard is good.

1184. Suet should be finely chopped, perfectly free from skin, and quite sweet; during the
process of chopping, it should be lightly dredged with flour, which prevents the pieces from
sticking together. Beef suet is considered the best; but veal suet, or the outside fat of a
loin or neck of mutton, makes good crusts; as also the skimmings in which a joint of mutton
has been boiled, but without vegetables.

1185. Clarified Beef Dripping, directions for which will be found in recipes Nos. 621 and 622,
answers very well for kitchen pies, puddings, cakes, or for family use. A very good short crust
may be made by mixing with it a small quantity of moist sugar; but care must be taken to use
the dripping sparingly, or a very disagreeable flavour will be imparted to the paste.

1186. Strict cleanliness must be observed in pastry-making; all the utensils used should be
perfectly free from dust and dirt, and the things required for pastry, kept entirely for that
purpose.

1187. In mixing paste, add the water very gradually, work the whole together with the knife-blade,
and knead it until perfectly smooth. Those who are inexperienced in pastry-making, should work
the butter in by breaking it in small pieces and covering the paste rolled out. It should then
be dredged with flour, and the ends folded over and rolled out very thin again: this process
must be repeated until all the butter is used.

1188. The art of making paste requires much practice, dexterity, and skill: it should be touched
as lightly as possible, made with cool hands and in a cool place (a marble slab is better than
a board for the purpose), and the coolest part of the house should be selected for the process
during warm weather.

1189. To insure rich paste being light, great expedition must be used in the making and baking;
for if it stand long before it is put in the oven, it becomes flat and heavy.

1190. Puff-paste requires a brisk oven, but not too hot, or it would blacken the crust; on
the other hand, if the oven be too slack, the paste will be soddened, and will not rise, nor
will it have any colour. Tart-tins, cake-moulds, dishes for baked puddings, pattypans, &c.,
should all be buttered before the article intended to be baked is put in them: things to be
baked on sheets should be placed on buttered paper. Raised-pie paste should have a soaking
heat, and paste glazed must have rather a slack oven, that the icing be not scorched. It is
better to ice tarts, &c. when they are three-parts baked.

1191. To ascertain when the oven is heated to the proper degree for puff-paste, put a small
piece of the paste in previous to baking the whole, and then the heat can thus be judged of.

1192. The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of much importance, as one bad article will
taint the whole mixture.

1193. When the freshness of eggs is doubtful, break each one separately in a cup, before mixing
them altogether. Should there be a bad one amongst them, it can be thrown away; whereas, if
mixed with the good ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled. The yolks and whites beaten
separately make the articles they are put into much lighter.

1194. Raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked, and, in many cases,
stoned. Currants should be well washed, pressed in a cloth, and placed on a dish before the
fire to get thoroughly dry; they should then be picked carefully over, and every piece of grit
or stone removed from amongst them. To plump them, some cooks pour boiling water over them,
and then dry them before the fire.

1195. Batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps. To insure this, first mix
the flour with a very small proportion of milk, and add the remainder by degrees. Should the
pudding be very lumpy, it may be strained through a hair sieve.

1196. All boiled puddings should be put on in boiling water, which must not be allowed to stop
simmering, and the pudding must always be covered with the water; if requisite, the saucepan
should be kept filled up.

1197. To prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan, place
a small plate or saucer underneath it, and set the pan on a trivet over the fire. If a mould
is used, this precaution is not necessary; but care must be taken to keep the pudding well
covered with water.

1198. For dishing a boiled pudding as soon as it comes out of the pot, dip it into a basin
of cold water, and the cloth will then not adhere to it. Great expedition is necessary in sending
puddings to table, as, by standing, they quickly become heavy, batter puddings particularly.

1199. For baked or boiled puddings, the moulds, cups, or basins, should be always buttered
before the mixture is put in them, and they should be put into the saucepan directly they are
filled.

1200. Scrupulous attention should be paid to the cleanliness of pudding-cloths, as, from neglect
in this particular, the outsides of boiled puddings frequently taste very disagreeably. As
soon as possible after it is taken off the pudding, it should be soaked in water, and then
well washed, without soap, unless it be very greasy. It should be dried out of doors, then
folded up and kept in a dry place. When wanted for use, dip it in boiling water, and dredge
it slightly with flour.

1201. The dry ingredients for puddings are better for being mixed some time before they are
wanted; the liquid portion should only be added just before the pudding is put into the saucepan.

1202. A pinch of salt is an improvement to the generality of puddings; but this ingredient
should be added very sparingly, as the flavour should not be detected.

1203. When baked puddings are sufficiently solid, turn them out of the dish they were baked
in, bottom uppermost, and strew over them fine sifted sugar.

1204. When pastry or baked puddings are not done through, and yet the outside is sufficiently
brown, cover them over with a piece of white paper until thoroughly cooked: this prevents them
from getting burnt.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXVII.

VERY GOOD PUFF-PASTE.

1205. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1 lb. of butter, and not quite 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Carefully weigh the flour and butter, and have the exact proportion; squeeze the butter
well, to extract the water from it, and afterwards wring it in a clean cloth, that no moisture
may remain. Sift the flour; see that it is perfectly dry, and proceed in the following manner
to make the paste, using a very clean paste-board and rolling-pin:--Supposing the quantity
to be 1 lb. of flour, work the whole into a smooth paste, with not quite 1/2 pint of water,
using a knife to mix it with: the proportion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by
the discretion of the cook; if too much be added, the paste, when baked, will be tough. Roll
it out until it is of an equal thickness of about an inch; break 4 oz. of the butter into small
pieces; place these on the paste, sift over it a little flour, fold it over, roll out again,
and put another 4 oz. of butter. Repeat the rolling and buttering until the paste has been
rolled out 4 times, or equal quantities of flour and butter have been used. Do not omit, every
time the paste is rolled out, to dredge a little flour over that and the rolling-pin, to prevent
both from sticking. Handle the paste as lightly as possible, and do not press heavily upon
it with the rolling-pin. The next thing to be considered is the oven, as the baking of pastry
requires particular attention. Do not put it into the oven until it is sufficiently hot to
raise the paste; for the best-prepared paste, if not properly baked, will be good for nothing.
Brushing the paste as often as rolled out, and the pieces of butter placed thereon, with the
white of an egg, assists it to rise in leaves or flakes. As this is the great beauty of puff-paste,
it is as well to try this method.

Average cost, 1s. 4d. per lb.

    BUTTER.--About the second century of the Christian era, butter
    was placed by Galen amongst the useful medical agents; and about
    a century before him, Dioscorides mentioned that he had noticed
    that fresh butter, made of ewes' and goats' milk, was served at
    meals instead of oil, and that it took the place of fat in
    making pastry. Thus we have undoubted authority that, eighteen
    hundred years ago, there existed a knowledge of the useful
    qualities of butter. The Romans seem to have set about making it
    much as we do; for Pliny tells us, "Butter is made from milk;
    and the use of this element, so much sought after by barbarous
    nations, distinguished the rich from the common people. It is
    obtained principally from cows' milk; that from ewes is the
    fattest; goats also supply some. It is produced by agitating the
    milk in long vessels with narrow openings: a little water is
    added."

MEDIUM PUFF-PASTE.

1206. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 8 oz. of butter, 4 oz. of lard, not quite 1/2
pint of water.

Mode.--This paste may be made by the directions in the preceding recipe, only using less butter
and substituting lard for a portion of it. Mix the flour to a smooth paste with not quite 1/2
pint of water; then roll it out 3 times, the first time covering the paste with butter, the
second with lard, and the third with butter. Keep the rolling-pin and paste slightly dredged
with flour, to prevent them from sticking, and it will be ready for use.

Average cost, 1s. per lb.

    BUTTER IN HASTE.--In his "History of Food," Soyer says that to
    obtain butter instantly, it is only necessary, in summer, to put
    new milk into a bottle, some hours after it has been taken from
    the cow, and shake it briskly. The clots which are thus formed
    should be thrown into a sieve, washed and pressed together, and
    they constitute the finest and most delicate butter that can
    possibly be made.

COMMON PASTE, for Family Pies.

1207. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, rather more than 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Rub the butter lightly into the flour, and mix it to a smooth paste with the water;
roll it out 2 or 3 times, and it will be ready for use. This paste may be converted into an
excellent short crust for sweet tart, by adding to the flour, after the butter is rubbed in,
2 tablespoonfuls of fine-sifted sugar.

Average cost, 8d. per lb.

    TO KEEP BUTTER FRESH.--One of the best means to preserve butter
    fresh is, first to completely press out all the buttermilk, then
    to keep it under water, renewing the water frequently, and to
    remove it from the influence of heat and air, by wrapping it in
    a wet cloth.

FRENCH PUFF-PASTE, or FEUILLETAGE.

(Founded on M. Ude's Recipe.)

1208. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of flour and butter--say 1 lb. of each; 1/2 saltspoonful
of salt, the yolks of 2 eggs, rather more than 1/4 pint of water.

Mode.--Weigh the flour; ascertain that it is perfectly dry, and sift it; squeeze all the water
from the butter, and wring it in a clean cloth till there is no moisture remaining. Put the
flour on the paste-board, work lightly into it 2 oz. of the butter, and then make a hole in
the centre; into this well put the yolks of 2 eggs, the salt, and about 1/4 pint of water (the
quantity of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the cook, as it is impossible to give
the exact proportion of it); knead up the paste quickly and lightly, and, when quite smooth,
roll it out square to the thickness of about 1/2 inch. Presuming that the butter is perfectly
free from moisture, and as cool as possible, roll it into a ball, and place this ball of butter
on the paste; fold the paste over the butter all round, and secure it by wrapping it well all
over. Flatten the paste by rolling it lightly with the rolling-pin until it is quite thin,
but not thin enough to allow the butter to break through, and keep the board and paste dredged
lightly with flour during the process of making it. This rolling gives it the first turn. Now
fold the paste in three, and roll out again, and, should the weather be very warm, put it in
a cold place on the ground to cool between the several turns; for, unless this is particularly
attended to, the paste will be spoiled. Roll out the paste again twice, put it by to cool,
then roll it out twice more, which will make 6 turnings in all. Now fold the paste in two,
and it will be ready for use. If properly baked and well made, this crust will be delicious,
and should rise in the oven about 5 or 6 inches. The paste should be made rather firm in the
first instance, as the ball of butter is liable to break through. Great attention must also
be paid to keeping the butter very cool, as, if this is in a liquid and soft state, the paste
will not answer at all. Should the cook be dexterous enough to succeed in making this, the
paste will have a much better appearance than that made by the process of dividing the butter
into 4 parts, and placing it over the rolled-out paste; but, until experience has been acquired,
we recommend puff-paste made by recipe No. 1205. The above paste is used for vols-au-vent,
small articles of pastry, and, in fact, everything that requires very light crust.

Average cost, 1s. 6d. per lb.

    WHAT TO DO WITH RANCID BUTTER.--When butter has become very
    rancid, it should be melted several times by a moderate heat,
    with or without the addition of water, and as soon as it has
    been well kneaded, after the cooling, in order to extract any
    water it may have retained, it should be put into brown
    freestone pots, sheltered from the contact of the air. The
    French often add to it, after it has been melted, a piece of
    toasted bread, which helps to destroy the tendency of the batter
    to rancidity.

SOYER'S RECIPE FOR PUFF-PASTE.

1209. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow the yolk of 1 egg, the juice of 1 lemon, 1/2
saltspoonful of salt, cold water, 1 lb. of fresh butter.

Mode.--Put the flour on to the paste-board; make a hole in the centre, into which put the yolk
of the egg, the lemon-juice, and salt; mix the whole with cold water (this should be iced in
summer, if convenient) into a soft flexible paste, with the right hand, and handle it as little
as possible; then squeeze all the buttermilk from the butter, wring it in a cloth, and roll
out the paste; place the butter on this, and fold the edges of the paste over, so as to hide
it; roll it out again to the thickness of 1/4 inch; fold over one third, over which again pass
the rolling-pin; then fold over the other third, thus forming a square; place it with the ends,
top, and bottom before you, shaking a little flour both under and over, and repeat the rolls
and turns twice again, as before. Flour a baking-sheet, put the paste on this, and let it remain
on ice or in some cool place for 1/2 hour; then roll twice more, turning it as before; place
it again upon the ice for 1/4 hour, give it 2 more rolls, making 7 in all, and it is ready
for use when required.

Average cost, 1s. 6d. per lb.

VERY GOOD SHORT CRUST FOR FRUIT TARTS.

1210. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 3/4 lb. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of sifted
sugar, 1/3 pint of water.

Mode.--Rub the butter into the flour, after having ascertained that the latter is perfectly
dry; add the sugar, and mix the whole into a stiff paste, with about 1/3 pint of water. Roll
it out two or three times, folding the paste over each time, and it will be ready for use.

Average cost, 1s. 1d. per lb.

ANOTHER GOOD SHORT CRUST.

1211. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 8 oz. of butter, the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 oz.
of sifted sugar, about 1/4 pint of milk.

Mode.--Rub the butter into the flour, add the sugar, and mix the whole as lightly as possible
to a smooth paste, with the yolks of eggs well beaten, and the milk. The proportion of the
latter ingredient must be judged of by the size of the eggs: if these are large, so much will
not be required, and more if the eggs are smaller.

Average cost, 1s. per lb.

    SUGAR AND BEETROOT.--There are two sorts of Beet,--white and
    red; occasionally, in the south, a yellow variety is met with.
    Beetroot contains twenty parts sugar. Everybody knows that the
    beet has competed with the sugar-cane, and a great part of the
    French sugar is manufactured from beet. Beetroot has a
    refreshing, composing, and slightly purgative quality. The young
    leaves, when cooked, are a substitute for spinach; they are also
    useful for mixing with sorrel, to lessen its acidity. The large
    ribs of the leaves are serviceable in various culinary
    preparations; the root also may be prepared in several ways, but
    its most general use is in salad. Some writers upon the subject
    have expressed their opinion that beetroot is easily digested,
    but those who have taken pains to carefully analyze its
    qualities make quite a contrary statement. Youth, of course, can
    digest it; but to persons of a certain age beet is very
    indigestible, or rather, it does not digest at all. It is not
    the sugary pulp which is indigestible, but its fibrous network
    that resists the action of the gastric organs. Thus, when the
    root is reduced to a puree, almost any person may eat it.

    FRENCH SUGAR.--It had long been thought that tropical heat was
    not necessary to form sugar, and, about 1740, it was discovered
    that many plants of the temperate zone, and amongst others the
    beet, contained it. Towards the beginning of the 19th century,
    circumstances having, in France, made sugar scarce, and
    consequently dear, the government caused inquiries to be
    instituted as to the possibility of finding a substitute for it.
    Accordingly, it was ascertained that sugar exists in the whole
    vegetable kingdom; that it is to be found in the grape,
    chestnut, potato; but that, far above all, the beet contains it
    in a large proportion. Thus the beet became an object of the
    most careful culture; and many experiments went to prove that in
    this respect the old world was independent of the new. Many
    manufactories came into existence in all parts of France, and
    the making of sugar became naturalized in that country.

COMMON SHORT CRUST.

1212. INGREDIENTS.--To every pound of flour allow 2 oz. of sifted sugar, 3 oz. of butter, about
1/2 pint of boiling milk.

Mode.--Crumble the butter into the flour as finely as possible, add the sugar, and work the
whole up to a smooth paste with the boiling milk. Roll it out thin, and bake in a moderate oven.

Average cost, 6d. per lb.

    QUALITIES OF SUGAR.--Sugars obtained from various plants are in
    fact, of the same nature, and have no intrinsic difference when
    they have become equally purified by the same processes. Taste,
    crystallization, colour, weight, are absolutely identical; and
    the most accurate observer cannot distinguish the one from the
    other.

BUTTER CRUST, for Boiled Puddings.

1213. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 6 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of water. It may
be enriched by adding another 2 oz. of butter; but, for ordinary purposes, the above quantity
will be found quite sufficient.

Average cost, 6d. per lb.

DRIPPING CRUST, for Kitchen Puddings, Pies, &c.

1214. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 6 oz. of clarified beef dripping, 1/2 pint
of water.

Mode.--After having clarified the dripping, by either of the recipes No. 621 or 622, weigh
it, and to every lb. of flour allow the above proportion of dripping. With a knife, work the
flour into a smooth paste with the water, rolling it out 3 times, each time placing on the
crust 2 oz. of the dripping, broken into small pieces. If this paste is lightly made, if good
dripping is used, and not too much of it, it will be found good; and by the addition of two
tablespoonfuls of fine moist sugar, it may be converted into a common short crust for fruit pies.

Average cost, 4d. per pound.

    WATER:--WHAT THE ANCIENTS THOUGHT OF IT.--All the nations of
    antiquity possessed great veneration for water: thus, the
    Egyptians offered prayers and homage to water, and the Nile was
    an especial object of their adoration; the Persians would not
    wash their hands; the Scythians honoured the Danube; the Greeks
    and Romans erected altars to the fountains and rivers; and some
    of the architectural embellishments executed for fountains in
    Greece were remarkable for their beauty and delicacy. The purity
    of the water was a great object of the care of the ancients; and
    we learn that the Athenians appointed four officers to keep
    watch and ward over the water in their city. These men had to
    keep the fountains in order and clean the reservoirs, so that
    the water might be preserved pure and limpid. Like officers were
    appointed in other Greek cities.

SUET CRUST, for Pies or Puddings.

1215. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 5 or 6 oz. of beef suet, 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Free the suet from skin and shreds; chop it extremely fine, and rub it well into the
flour; work the whole to a smooth paste with the above proportion of water; roll it out, and
it is ready for use. This crust is quite rich enough for ordinary purposes, but when a better
one is desired, use from 1/2 to 3/4 lb. of suet to every lb. of flour. Some cooks, for rich
crusts, pound the suet in a mortar, with a small quantity of butter. It should then be laid
on the paste in small pieces, the same as for puff-crust, and will be found exceedingly nice
for hot tarts. 5 oz. of suet to every lb. of flour will make a very good crust; and even 1/4
lb. will answer very well for children, or where the crust is wanted very plain.

Average cost, 5d. per lb.

PATE BRISEE, or FRENCH CRUST, for Raised Pies.

1216. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, 1/3 pint
of water, 6 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Spread the flour, which should be sifted and thoroughly dry, on the paste-board; make
a hole in the centre, into which put the butter; work it lightly into the flour, and when quite
fine, add the salt; work the whole into a smooth paste with the eggs (yolks and whites) and
water, and make it very firm. Knead the paste well, and let it be rather stiff, that the sides
of the pie may be easily raised, and that they do not afterwards tumble or shrink.

Average cost, 1s. per lb.

Note.--This paste may be very much enriched by making it with equal quantities of flour and
butter; but then it is not so easily raised as when made plainer.

    WATER SUPPLY IN ROME.--Nothing in Italy is more extraordinary
    than the remains of the ancient aqueducts. At first, the Romans
    were contented with the water from the Tiber. Ancus Martius was
    the first to commence the building of aqueducts destined to
    convey the water of the fountain of Piconia from Tibur to Rome,
    a distance of some 33,000 paces. Appius Claudius continued the
    good work, and to him is due the completion of the celebrated
    Appian Way. In time, the gigantic waterways greatly multiplied,
    and, by the reign of Nero, there were constructed nine principal
    aqueducts, the pipes of which were of bricks, baked tiles,
    stone, lead, or wood. According to the calculation of Vigenerus,
    half a million hogsheads of water were conveyed into Rome every
    day, by upwards of 10,000 small pipes not one-third of an inch
    in diameter. The water was received in large closed basins,
    above which rose splendid monuments: these basins supplied other
    subterranean conduits, connected with various quarters of the
    city, and these conveyed water to small reservoirs furnished
    with taps for the exclusive use of certain streets. The water
    which was not drinkable ran out, by means of large pipes, into
    extensive inclosures, where it served to water cattle. At these
    places the people wished their linen; and here, too, was a
    supply of the necessary element in case of fire.

COMMON CRUST FOE RAISED PIES.

1217. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1/2 pint of water, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 1-1/2
oz. of lard, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Put into a saucepan the water; when it boils, add the butter and lard; and when these
are melted, make a hole in the middle of the flour; pour in the water gradually; beat it well
with a wooden spoon, and be particular in not making the paste too soft. When it is well mixed,
knead it with the hands until quite stiff, dredging a little flour over the paste and board,
to prevent them from sticking. When it is well kneaded, place it before the fire, with a cloth
covered over it, for a few minutes; it will then be more easily worked into shape. This paste
does not taste so nicely as the preceding one, but is worked with greater facility, and answers
just as well for raised pies, for the crust is seldom eaten.

Average cost, 5d, per lb.

LARD OR FLEAD CRUST.

1218. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1/2 lb. of lard or flead, 1/2 pint of water,
1/2 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Clear the flead free from skin, and slice it into thin flakes; rub it into the flour,
add the salt, and work the whole into a smooth paste, with the above proportion of water; fold
the paste over two or three times, beat it well with the rolling-pin, roll it out, and it will
be ready for use. The crust made from this will be found extremely light, and may be made into
cakes or tarts; it may also be very much enriched by adding more flead to the same proportion
of flour.

Average cost, 8d. per lb.

    NUTRITIOUS QUALITIES OF FLOUR.--The gluten of grain and the
    albumen of vegetable juices are identical in composition with
    the albumen of blood. Vegetable caseine has also the composition
    of animal caseine. The finest wheat flour contains more starch
    than the coarser; the bran of wheat is proportionably richer in
    gluten. Rye and rye-bread contain a substance resembling
    starch-gum (or dextrine, as it is called) in its properties,
    which is very easily converted into sugar. The starch of barley
    approaches in many properties to cellulose, and is, therefore,
    less digestible. Oats are particularly rich in plastic
    substances; Scotch oats are richer than those grown in England
    or in Germany. This kind of grain contains in its ashes, after
    deduction of the silica of the husks, very nearly the same
    ingredients as are found in the ashes of the juice of flesh.
    Fine American flour is one of the varieties which is richest in
    gluten, and is consequently one of the most nutritious.

ALMOND CHEESECAKES.

1219. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of sweet almonds, 4 bitter ones, 3 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, the rind
of 1/4 lemon, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 3 oz. of sugar.

Mode.--Blanch and pound the almonds smoothly in a mortar, with a little rose- or spring-water;
stir in the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the butter, which should be warmed; add
the grated lemon-peel and -juice, sweeten, and stir well until the whole is thoroughly mixed.
Line some pattypans with puff-paste, put in the mixture, and bake for 20 minutes, or rather
less in a quick oven.

Time.--20 minutes, or rather less.

Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient for about 12 cheesecakes.

Seasonable at any time.

    ALMONDS.--Almonds are the fruit of the Amygdalus commenis, and
    are cultivated throughout the whole of the south of Europe,
    Syria, Persia, and Northern Africa; but England is mostly
    supplied with those which are grown in Spain and the south of
    France. They are distinguished into Sweet and Bitter, the
    produce of different varieties. Of the sweet, there are two
    varieties, distinguished in commerce by the names of Jordan and
    Valentia almonds. The former are imported from Malaga, and are
    longer, narrower, more pointed, and more highly esteemed than
    the latter, which are imported from Valentia. Bitter almonds are
    principally obtained from Morocco, and are exported from
    Mogador.

ALMOND PASTE, for Second-Course Dishes.

1220. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of sweet almonds, 6 bitter ones, 1 lb. of very finely sifted sugar,
the whites of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Blanch the almonds, and dry them thoroughly; put them into a mortar, and pound them
well, wetting them gradually with the whites of 2 eggs. When well pounded, put them into a
small preserving-pan, add the sugar, and place the pan on a small but clear fire (a hot-plate
is better); keep stirring until the paste is dry, then take it out of the pan, put it between
two dishes, and, when cold, make it into any shape that fancy may dictate.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, 2s. for the above quantity.

Sufficient for 3 small dishes of pastry.

Seasonable at any time.

    BITTER ALMONDS.--The Bitter Almond is a variety of the common
    almond, and is injurious to animal life, on account of the great
    quantity of hydrocyanic acid it contains, and is consequently
    seldom used in domestic economy, unless it be to give flavour to
    confectionery; and even then it should he used with great
    caution. A single drop of the essential oil of bitter almonds is
    sufficient to destroy a bird, and four drops have caused the
    death of a middle-sized dog.

BAKED ALMOND PUDDING.

(Very rich.)

1221. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of almonds, 4 bitter ditto, 1 glass of sherry, 4 eggs, the rind
and juice of 1/2 lemon, 3 oz. of butter, 1 pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.

Mode.--Blanch and pound the almonds to a smooth paste with the water; mix these with the butter,
which should be melted; beat up the eggs, grate the lemon-rind, and strain the juice; add these,
with the cream, sugar, and wine, to the other ingredients, and stir them well together. 3d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--To make this pudding more economically, substitute milk for the cream; but then add
rather more than 1 oz. of finely grated bread.

    USES OF THE SWEET ALMOND.--The kernels of the sweet almond are
    used either in a green or ripe state, and as an article in the
    dessert. Into cookery, confectionery, perfumery, and medicine,
    they largely enter, and in domestic economy, should always be
    used in preference to bitter almonds. The reason for advising
    this, is because the kernels do not contain any hydrocyanic or
    prussic acid, although it is found in the leaves, flowers, and
    bark of the tree. When young and green, they are preserved in
    sugar, like green apricots. They furnish the almond-oil; and the
    farinaceous matter which is left after the oil is expressed,
    forms the pâte d'amandes of perfumers. In the arts, the oil is
    employed for the same purposes as the olive-oil, and forms the
    basis of kalydor, macassar oil, Gowland's lotion, and many other
    articles of that kind vended by perfumers. In medicine, it is
    considered a nutritive, laxative, and an emollient.

SMALL ALMOND PUDDINGS.

1222. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of sweet almonds, 6 bitter ones, 1/4 lb. of butter, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls
of sifted sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.

Mode.--Blanch and pound the almonds to a smooth paste with a spoonful of water; warm the butter,
mix the almonds with this, and add the other ingredients, leaving out the whites of 2 eggs,
and be particular that these are well beaten. Mix well, butter some cups, half fill them, and
bake the puddings from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time.

    THE HUSKS OF ALMONDS.--In the environs of Alicante, the husks of
    almonds are ground to a powder, and enter into the composition
    of common soap, the large quantity of alkaline principle they
    contain rendering them suitable for this purpose. It is said
    that in some parts of the south of France, where they are
    extensively grown, horses and mules are fed on the green and dry
    husks; but, to prevent any evil consequences arising from this
    practice, they are mixed with chopped straw or oats.

ALMOND PUFFS.

1223. INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of pounded sugar, 2 oz.
of sweet almonds, 4 bitter almonds.

Mode.--Blanch and pound the almonds in a mortar to a smooth paste; melt the butter, dredge
in the flour, and add the sugar and pounded almonds. Beat the mixture well, and put it into
cups or very tiny jelly-pots, which should be well buttered, and bake in a moderate oven for
about 20 minutes, or longer should the puffs be large. Turn them out on a dish, the bottom
of the puff upper-most, and serve.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient for 2 or 3 persons. Seasonable at any time.

AUNT NELLY'S PUDDING.

1224. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of treacle, 1/2 lb. of suet, the rind and juice
of 1 lemon, a few strips of candied lemon-peel, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 eggs.

Mode.--Chop the suet finely; mix with it the flour, treacle, lemon-peel minced, and candied
lemon-peel; add the cream, lemon-juice, and 2 well-beaten eggs; beat the pudding well, put
it into a buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, and boil from 3-1/2 to 4 hours. 2d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time, but more suitable for a winter pudding.

    TREACLE, OR MOLASSES.--Treacle is the uncrystallizable part of
    the saccharine juice drained from the Muscovado sugar, and is
    either naturally so or rendered uncrystallizable through some
    defect in the process of boiling. As it contains a large
    quantity of sweet or saccharine principle and is cheap, it is of
    great use as an article of domestic economy. Children are
    especially fond of it; and it is accounted wholesome. It is also
    useful for making beer, rum, and the very dark syrups.

BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS (a Plain Family Dish).

1225. INGREDIENTS.--6 apples, 3/4 lb.. of suet-crust No. 1215, sugar to taste.

Mode.--Pare and take out the cores of the apples without dividing them, and make 1/2 lb. of
suet-crust by recipe No. 1215; roll the apples in the crust, previously sweetening them with
moist sugar, and taking care to join the paste nicely. When they are formed into round balls,
put them on a tin, and bake them for about 1/2 hour, or longer should the apples be very large;
arrange them pyramidically on a dish, and sift over them some pounded white sugar. These may
be made richer by using one of the puff-pastes instead of suet.

Time.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour, or longer. Average cost, 1-1/2d. each.

Sufficient for 4 persons.

Seasonable from August to March, but flavourless after the end of January.

    USES OF THE APPLE.--It is well known that this fruit forms a
    very important article of food, in the form of pies and
    puddings, and furnishes several delicacies, such as sauces,
    marmalades, and jellies, and is much esteemed as a dessert
    fruit. When flattened in the form of round cakes, and baked in
    ovens, they are called beefings; and large quantities are
    annually dried in the sun in America, as well as in Normandy,
    and stored for use during winter, when they may be stewed or
    made into pies. In a roasted state they are remarkably
    wholesome, and, it is said, strengthening to a weak stomach. In
    putrid and malignant fevers, when used with the juice of lemons
    and currants, they are considered highly efficacious.

APPLE CHEESECAKES.

1226. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of apple pulp, 1/4 lb. of sifted sugar, 1/4 lb. of butter, 4 eggs,
the rind and juice of 1 lemon.

Mode.--Pare, core, and boil sufficient apples to make 1/2 lb. when cooked; add to these the
sugar, the butter, which should be melted; the eggs, leaving out 2 of the whites, and take
grated rind and juice of 1 lemon; stir the mixture well; line some patty-pans with puff-paste,
put in the mixture, and bake about 20 minutes.

Time.--About 20 minutes.

Average cost, for the above quantity, with the paste, 1s. 2d.

Sufficient for about 18 or 20 cheesecakes.

Seasonable from August to March.

    THE APPLE.--The most useful of all the British fruits is the
    apple, which is a native of Britain, and may be found in woods
    and hedges, in the form of the common wild crab, of which all
    our best apples are merely seminal varieties, produced by
    culture or particular circumstances. In most temperate climates
    it is very extensively cultivated, and in England, both as
    regards variety and quantity, it is excellent and abundant.
    Immense supplies are also imported from the United States and
    from France. The apples grown in the vicinity of New York are
    universally admitted to be the finest of any; but unless
    selected and packed with great care, they are apt to spoil
    before reaching England.

BOILED APPLE DUMPLINGS.

1227. Keep them boiling from 1/2 to 3/4 hour; remove the cloths, and send them hot and quickly
to table. Dumplings boiled in knitted cloths have a very pretty appearance when they come to
table. The cloths should be made square, just large enough to hold one dumpling, and should
be knitted in plain knitting, with very coarse cotton.

Time.--3/4 to 1 hour, or longer should the dumplings be very large.

    LAMBSWOOL, or LAMASOOL.--This old English beverage is composed
    of apples mixed with ale, and seasoned with sugar and spice. It
    takes its name from Lamaes abhal, which, in ancient British,
    signifies the day of apple fruit, from being drunk on the apple
    feast in autumn. In France, a beverage, called by the Parisians
    raisinée, is made by boiling any given quantity of new wine,
    skimming it as often as fresh scum rises, and, when it is boiled
    to half its bulk, straining it. To this apples, pared and cut
    into quarters, are added; the whole is then allowed to simmer
    gently, stirring it all the time with a long wooden spoon, till
    the apples are thoroughly mixed with the liquor, and the whole
    forms a species of marmalade, which is extremely agreeable to
    the taste, having a slight flavour of acidity, like lemon mixed
    with honey.

RICH BAKED APPLE PUDDING.

I.

1228. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of the pulp of apples, 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar, 6 oz. of butter,
the rind of 1 lemon, 6 eggs, puff-paste.

Mode.--Peel, core, and cut the apples, as for sauce; put them into a stewpan, with only just
sufficient water to prevent them from burning, and let them stew until reduced to a pulp. Weigh
the pulp, and to every 1/2 lb. add sifted sugar, grated lemon-rind, and 6 well-beaten eggs.
Beat these ingredients well together; then melt the butter, stir it to the other things, put
a border of puff-paste round the dish, and bake for rather more than 1/2 hour. The butter should
not be added until the pudding is ready for the oven. 10d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from August to March.

II.

(More Economical.)

1229. INGREDIENTS.--12 large apples, 6 oz. of moist sugar, 1/4 lb. of butter, 4 eggs, 1 pint
of bread crumbs.

Mode.--Pare, core, and cut the apples, as for sauce, and boil them until reduced to a pulp;
then add the butter, melted, and the eggs, which should be well whisked.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from August to March.

Note.--A very good economical pudding may be made merely with apples, boiled and sweetened,
with the addition of a few strips of lemon-peel. A layer of bread crumbs should be placed above
and below the apples, and the pudding baked for 1/2 hour.

    CONSTITUENTS OF THE APPLE.--All apples contain sugar, malic
    acid, or the acid of apples; mucilage, or gum; woody fibre, and
    water; together with some aroma, on which their peculiar flavour
    depends. The hard acid kinds are unwholesome if eaten raw; but
    by the process of cooking, a great deal of this acid is
    decomposed and converted into sugar. The sweet and mellow kinds
    form a valuable addition to the dessert. A great part of the
    acid juice is converted into sugar as the fruit ripens, and even
    after it is gathered, by natural process, termed maturation;
    but, when apples decay, the sugar is changed into a bitter
    principle, and the mucilage becomes mouldy and offensive. Old
    cheese has a remarkable effect in meliorating the apple when
    eaten; probably from the volatile alkali or ammonia of the
    cheese neutralizing its acid.

RICH SWEET APPLE PUDDING.

1230. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, 1/2 lb. of suet, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1/2 lb.
of apples, 1/2 lb. of moist sugar, 6 eggs, 12 sweet almonds, 1/2 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg,
1 wineglassful of brandy.

Mode.--Chop the suet very fine; wash the currants, dry them, and pick away the stalks and pieces
of grit; pare, core, and chop the apple, and grate the bread into fine crumbs, and mince the
almonds. Mix all these ingredients together, adding the sugar and nutmeg; beat up the eggs,
omitting the whites of three; stir these to the pudding, and when all is well mixed, add the
brandy, and put the pudding into a buttered mould; tie down with a cloth, put it into boiling
water, and let it boil for 3 hours.

Time.--3 hours.

Average cost, 2s.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from August to March.

    TO PRESERVE APPLES.--The best mode of preserving apples is to
    carry them at once to the fruit-room, where they should be put
    upon shelves, covered with white paper, after gently wiping each
    of the fruit. The room should be dry, and well aired, but should
    not admit the sun. The finer and larger kinds of fruit should
    not be allowed to touch each other, but should be kept separate.
    For this purpose, a number of shallow trays should be provided,
    supported by racks or stands above each other. In very cold
    frosty weather, means should be adopted for warming the room.

BAKED APPLE PUDDING.

(Very Good.)

1231. INGREDIENTS.--5 moderate-sized apples, 2 tablespoonfuls of finely-chopped suet, 3 eggs,
3 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 pint of milk, a little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter with the milk; add the eggs, which should be well whisked,
and put this batter into a well-buttered pie-dish. Wipe the apples clean, but do not pare them;
cut them in halves, and take out the cores; lay them in the batter, rind uppermost; shake the
suet on the top, over which, also grate a little nutmeg; bake in a moderate oven for an hour,
and cover, when served, with sifted loaf sugar. This pudding is also very good with the apples
pared, sliced, and mixed with the batter.

Time.--1 hour.

Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

BOILED APPLE PUDDING.

1232. INGREDIENTS.--Crust No. 1215, apples, sugar to taste, 1 small teaspoonful of finely-minced
lemon-peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Make a butter-crust by recipe No. 1213, or a suet one by recipe No. 1215, using for
a moderate-sized pudding from 3/4 to 1 lb. of flour, with the other ingredients in proportion.
Butter a basin; line it with some of the paste; pare, core, and cut the apples into slices,
and fill the basin with these; add the sugar, the lemon-peel and juice, and cover with crust;
pinch the edges together, flour the cloth, place it over the pudding, tie it securely, and
put it into plenty of fast-boiling water. Let it boil from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours, according
to the size; then turn it out of the basin and send to table quickly. Apple puddings may also
be boiled in a cloth without a basin; but, when made in this way, must be served without the
least delay, as the crust so soon becomes heavy. Apple pudding is a very convenient dish to
have when the dinner-hour is rather uncertain, as it does not spoil by being boiled an extra
hour; care, however, must be taken to keep it well covered with the water all the time, and
not to allow it to stop boiling.

Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient, made with 1 lb. of flour, for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from August to March; but the apples become flavourless and scarce after February.

APPLE TART OR PIE.

1233. When it is three-parts done, take it out of the oven, put the white of an egg on a plate,
and, with the blade of a knife, whisk it to a froth; brush the pie over with this, then sprinkle
upon it some sifted sugar, and then a few drops of water. Put the pie back into the oven, and
finish baking, and be particularly careful that it does not catch or burn, which it is very
liable to do after the crust is iced. If made with a plain crust, the icing may be omitted.

Time.--1/2 hour before the crust is iced; 10 to 15 minutes afterwards.

Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient.--Allow 2 lbs. of apples for a tart for 6 persons.

Seasonable from August to March; but the apples become flavourless after February.

Note.--Many things are suggested for the flavouring of apple pie; some say 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls
of beer, others the same quantity of sherry, which very much improve the taste; whilst the
old-fashioned addition of a few cloves is, by many persons, preferred to anything else, as
also a few slices of quince.

    QUINCES.--The environs of Corinth originally produced the most
    beautiful quinces, but the plant was subsequently introduced
    into Gaul with the most perfect success. The ancients preserved
    the fruit by placing it, with its branches and leaves, in a
    vessel filled with honey or sweet wine, which was reduced to
    half the quantity by ebullition. Quinces may be profitably
    cultivated in this country as a variety with other fruit-trees,
    and may be planted in espaliers or as standards. A very
    fine-flavoured marmalade may be prepared from quinces, and a
    small portion of quince in apple pie much improves its flavour.
    The French use quinces for flavouring many sauces. This fruit
    has the remarkable peculiarity of exhaling an agreeable odour,
    taken singly; but when in any quantity, or when they are stowed
    away in a drawer or close room, the pleasant aroma becomes an
    intolerable stench, although the fruit may be perfectly sound;
    it is therefore desirable that, as but a few quinces are
    required for keeping, they should be kept in a high and dry
    loft, and out of the way of the rooms used by the family.

CREAMED APPLE TART.

1234.

Mode.--Make an apple tart by the preceding recipe, with the exception of omitting the icing.
When the tart is baked, cut out the middle of the lid or crust, leaving a border all round
the dish. Fill up with a nicely-made boiled custard, grate a little nutmeg over the top, and
the pie is ready for table. This tart is usually eaten cold; is rather an old-fashioned dish,
but, at the same time, extremely nice.

APPLE SNOWBALLS.

1235. INGREDIENTS.--2 teacupfuls of rice, apples, moist sugar, cloves.

Mode.--Boil the rice in milk until three-parts done; then strain it off, and pare and core
the apples without dividing them. Put a small quantity of sugar and a clove into each apple,
put the rice round them, and tie each ball separately in a cloth. Boil until the apples are
tender; then take them up, remove the cloths, and serve.

Time.--1/2 hour to boil the rice separately; 1/2 to 1 hour with the apple.

Seasonable from August to March.

APPLE TOURTE OR CAKE.

(German Recipe.)

1236. INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 apples, sugar to taste, the rind of 1 small lemon, 3 eggs, 1/4
pint of cream or milk, 1/4 lb. of butter, 3/4 lb. of good short crust No. 1211, 3 oz. of sweet
almonds.

Mode.--Pare, core, and cut the apples into small pieces; put sufficient moist sugar to sweeten
them into a basin; add the lemon-peel, which should be finely minced, and the cream; stir these
ingredients well, whisk the eggs, and melt the butter; mix altogether, add the sliced apple,
and let these be well stirred into the mixture. Line a large round plate with the paste, place
a narrow rim of the same round the outer edge, and lay the apples thickly in the middle. Blanch
the almonds, cut them into long shreds, and strew over the top of the apples, and bake from
1/2 to 3/4 hour, taking care that the almonds do not get burnt: when done, strew some sifted
sugar over the top, and serve. This tourte may be eaten either hot or cold, and is sufficient
to fill 2 large-sized plates. 2d.

Sufficient for 2 large-sized tourtes.

Seasonable from August to March.

    APPLES.--No fruit is so universally popular as the apple. It is
    grown extensively for cider, but many sorts are cultivated for
    the table. The apple, uncooked, is less digestible than the
    pear; the degree of digestibility varying according to the
    firmness of its texture and flavour. Very wholesome and
    delicious jellies, marmalades, and sweetmeats are prepared from
    it. Entremets of apples are made in great variety. Apples, when
    peeled, cored, and well cooked, are a most grateful food for the
    dyspeptic.

ALMA PUDDING.

1237. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of fresh butter, 1/2 lb. of powdered sugar, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4
lb. of currants, 4 eggs.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a thick cream, strew in, by degrees, the sugar, and mix both these
well together; then dredge the flour in gradually, add the currants, and moisten with the eggs,
which should be well beaten. When all the ingredients are well stirred and mixed, butter a
mould that will hold the mixture exactly, tie it down with a cloth, put the pudding into boiling
water, and boil for 5 hours; when turned out, strew some powdered sugar over it, and serve.

BAKED APRICOT PUDDING.

1238. INGREDIENTS.--12 large apricots, 3/4 pint of bread crumbs, 1 pint of milk, 3 oz. of pounded
sugar, the yolks of 4 eggs, 1 glass of sherry.

Mode.--Make the milk boiling hot, and pour it on to the bread crumbs; when half cold, add the
sugar, the well-whisked yolks of the eggs, and the sherry. Divide the apricots in half, scald
them until they are soft, and break them up with a spoon, adding a few of the kernels, which
should be well pounded in a mortar; then mix the fruit and other ingredients together, put
a border of paste round the dish, fill with the mixture, and bake the pudding from 1/2 to 3/4
hour. 6d.

APRICOT TART.

1239. INGREDIENTS.--12 or 14 apricots, sugar to taste, puff-paste or short crust.

Mode.--Break the apricots in half, take out the stones, and put them into a pie-dish, in the
centre of which place a very small cup or jar, bottom uppermost; sweeten with good moist sugar,
but add no water. Line the edge of the dish with paste, put on the cover, and ornament the
pie in any of the usual modes. Bake from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, according to size; and if puff-paste
is used, glaze it about 10 minutes before the pie is done, and put it into the oven again to
set the glaze. Short crust merely requires a little sifted sugar sprinkled over it before being
sent to table.

Note.--Green apricots make very good tarts, but they should be boiled with a little sugar and
water before they are covered with the crust.

    APRICOTS.--The apricot is indigenous to the plains of Armenia,
    but is now cultivated in almost every climate, temperate or
    tropical. There are several varieties. The skin of this fruit
    has a perfumed flavour, highly esteemed. A good apricot, when
    perfectly ripe, is an excellent fruit. It has been somewhat
    condemned for its laxative qualities, but this has possibly
    arisen from the fruit having been eaten unripe, or in too great
    excess. Delicate persons should not eat the apricot uncooked,
    without a liberal allowance of powdered sugar. The apricot makes
    excellent jam and marmalade, and there are several foreign
    preparations of it which are considered great luxuries.

BAKED OR BOILED ARROWROOT PUDDING.

1240. INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, the
rind of 1/2 lemon, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, a little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Mix the arrowroot with as much cold milk as will make it into a smooth batter, moderately
thick; put the remainder of the milk into a stewpan with the lemon-peel, and let it infuse
for about 1/2 hour; when it boils, strain it gently to the batter, stirring it all the time
to keep it smooth; then add the butter; beat this well in until thoroughly mixed, and sweeten
with moist sugar. Put the mixture into a pie-dish, round which has been placed a border of
paste, grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake the pudding from 1 to 1-1/4 hour, in a
moderate oven, or boil it the same length of time in a well-buttered basin. To enrich this
pudding, stir to the other ingredients, just before it is put in the oven, 3 well-whisked eggs,
and add a tablespoonful of brandy. For a nursery pudding, the addition of the latter ingredients
will be found quite superfluous, as also the paste round the edge of the dish.

Time.--1 to 1-1/4 hour, baked or boiled. Average cost, 7d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

    ARROWROOT.--In India, and in the colonies, by the process of
    rasping, they extract from a vegetable (Maranta arundinacea) a
    sediment nearly resembling tapioca. The grated pulp is sifted
    into a quantity of water, from which it is afterwards strained
    and dried, and the sediment thus produced is called arrowroot.
    Its qualities closely resemble those of tapioca.

A BACHELOR'S PUDDING.

1241. INGREDIENTS.--4 oz. of grated bread, 4 oz. of currants, 4 oz. of apples, 2 oz. of sugar,
3 eggs, a few drops of essence of lemon, a little grated nutmeg.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from August to March.

BAKEWELL PUDDING.

(Very Rich.)

I.

1242. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of puff-paste, 5 eggs, 6 oz. of sugar, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1 oz.
of almonds, jam.

Mode.--Cover a dish with thin paste, and put over this a layer of any kind of jam, 1/2 inch
thick; put the yolks of 5 eggs into a basin with the white of 1, and beat these well; add the
sifted sugar, the butter, which should be melted, and the almonds, which should be well pounded;
beat all together until well mixed, then pour it into the dish over the jam, and bake for an
hour in a moderate oven.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 4 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

II.

1243.

Mode.--Put the bread crumbs at the bottom of a pie-dish, then over them a layer of jam of any
kind that may be preferred; mix the milk and eggs together; add the sugar, butter, and pounded
almonds; beat fill well together; pour it into the dish, and bake in a moderate oven for 1 hour.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost. 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time.

BARONESS PUDDING.

(Author's Recipe.)

1244. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of suet, 3/4 lb. of raisins weighed after being stoned, 3/4 lb.
of flour, 1/2 pint of milk, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Prepare the suet, by carefully freeing it from skin, and chop it finely; stone the raisins,
and cut them in halves, and mix both these ingredients with the salt and flour; moisten the
whole with the above proportion of milk, stir the mixture well, and tie the pudding in a floured
cloth, which has been previously wrung out in boiling water. Put the pudding into a saucepan
of boiling water, and let it boil, without ceasing, 4-1/2 hours. Serve merely with plain sifted
sugar, a little of which may be sprinkled over the pudding. 4d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable in winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable.

Note.--This pudding the editress cannot too highly recommend. The recipe was kindly given to
her family by a lady who bore the title here prefixed to it; and with all who have partaken
of it, it is an especial favourite. Nothing is of greater consequence, in the above directions,
than attention to the time of boiling, which should never be less than that mentioned.

BARBERRY TART.

1245. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of barberries allow 3/4 lb. of lump sugar; paste.

Mode.--Pick the barberries from the stalks, and put the fruit into a stone jar; place this
jar in boiling water, and let it simmer very slowly until the fruit is soft; then put it into
a preserving-pan with the sugar, and boil gently for 15 minutes; line a tartlet-pan with paste,
bake it, and, when the paste is cold, fill with the barberries, and ornament the tart with
a few baked leaves of paste, cut out, as shown in the engraving.

Time.--1/4 hour to bake the tart.

Average cost, 4d. per pint.

Seasonable in autumn.

    BARBERRIES (Berberris vulgaris.)--A fruit of such great
    acidity, that even birds refuse to eat it. In this respect, it
    nearly approaches the tamarind. When boiled with sugar, it makes
    a very agreeable preserve or jelly, according to the different
    modes of preparing it. Barberries are also used as a dry
    sweetmeat, and in sugarplums or comfits; are pickled with
    vinegar, and are used for various culinary purposes. They are
    well calculated to allay heat and thirst in persons afflicted
    with fevers. The berries, arranged on bunches of nice curled
    parsley, make an exceedingly pretty garnish for supper-dishes,
    particularly for white meats, like boiled fowl à la Béchamel,
    the three colours, scarlet, green, and white, contrasting so
    well, and producing a very good effect.

BAKED BATTER PUDDING.

1246. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 4 eggs,
a little salt.

Mode.--Mix the flour with a small quantity of cold milk; make the remainder hot, and pour it
on to the flour, keeping the mixture well stirred; add the butter, eggs, and salt; beat the
whole well, and put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish; bake for 3/4 hour, and serve with
sweet sauce, wine sauce, or stewed fruit. Baked in small cups, this makes very pretty little
puddings, and should be eaten with the same accompaniments as above. Seasonable at any time.

BAKED BATTER PUDDING, with Dried or Fresh Fruit.

1247.

Mode.--Mix the milk, flour, and eggs to a smooth batter; add a little salt, the suet, and the
currants, which should be well washed, picked, and dried; put the mixture into a buttered pie-dish,
and bake in a moderate oven for 1-1/4 hour. When fresh fruits are in season, this pudding is
exceedingly nice, with damsons, plums, red currants, gooseberries, or apples; when made with
these, the pudding must be thickly sprinkled over with sifted sugar. Boiled batter pudding,
with fruit, is made in the same manner, by putting the fruit into a buttered basin, and filling
it up with batter made in the above proportion, but omitting the suet. It must be sent quickly
to table, and covered plentifully with sifted sugar.

Time.--Baked batter pudding, with fruit, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour; boiled ditto, 1-1/2 to 1-3/4
hour, allowing that both are made with the above proportion of batter. Smaller puddings will
be done enough in 3/4 or 1 hour.

Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable at any time, with dried fruits.

BOILED BATTER PUDDING.

1248. INGREDIENTS.--3 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, 1 pint of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, a little
salt.

Mode.--Put the flour into a basin, and add sufficient milk to moisten it; carefully rub down
all the lumps with a spoon, then pour in the remainder of the milk, and stir in the butter,
which should be previously melted; keep beating the mixture, add the eggs and a pinch of salt,
and when the batter is quite smooth, put it into a well-buttered basin, tie it down very tightly,
and put it into boiling water; move the basin about for a few minutes after it is put into
the water, to prevent the flour settling in any part, and boil for 1-1/4 hour. This pudding
may also be boiled in a floured cloth that has been wetted in hot water; it will then take
a few minutes less than when boiled in a basin. Send these puddings very quickly to table,
and serve with sweet sauce, wine sauce, stewed fruit, or jam of any kind: when the latter is
used, a little of it may be placed round the dish in small quantities, as a garnish.

Time.--1-1/4 hour in a basin, 1 hour in a cloth.

ORANGE BATTER PUDDING.

1249. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 1-1/4 oz. of loaf sugar, 3 tablespoonfuls of flour.

Mode.--Make the batter with the above ingredients, put it into a well-buttered basin, tie it
down with a cloth, and boil for 1 hour. As soon as it is turned out of the basin, put a small
jar of orange marmalade all over the top, and send the pudding very quickly to table.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost, with the marmalade, 1s. 3d.

BAKED BREAD PUDDING.

1250. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of grated bread, 1 pint of milk, 4 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, 4 oz.
of moist sugar, 2 oz. of candied peel, 6 bitter almonds, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.

Mode.--Put the milk into a stewpan, with the bitter almonds; let it infuse for 1/4 hour; bring
it to the boiling point; strain it on to the bread crumbs, and let these remain till cold;
then add the eggs, which should be well whisked, the butter, sugar, and brandy, and beat the
pudding well until all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed; line the bottom of a pie-dish
with the candied peel sliced thin, put in the mixture, and bake for nearly 3/4 hour.

Time.--Nearly 3/4 hour. Average cost, 1s.

VERY PLAIN BREAD PUDDING.

1251. INGREDIENTS.--Odd pieces of crust or crumb of bread; to every quart allow 1/2 teaspoonful
of salt, 1 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 3 oz. of moist sugar, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1-1/4 oz.
of butter.

Mode.--Break the bread into small pieces, and pour on them as much boiling water as will soak
them well. Let these stand till the water is cool; then press it out, and mash the bread with
a fork until it is quite free from lumps. Measure this pulp, and to every quart stir in salt,
nutmeg, sugar, and currants in the above proportion; mix all well together, and put it into
a well-buttered pie-dish. Smooth the surface with the back of a spoon, and place the butter
in small pieces over the top; bake in a moderate oven for 1-1/2 hour, and serve very hot. Boiling
milk substituted for the boiling water would very much improve this pudding.

Time.--1-1/2 hour. Average cost, 6d., exclusive of the bread.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time.

BOILED BREAD PUDDING.

1252. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 3/4 pint of bread crumbs, sugar to taste, 4 eggs, 1
oz. of butter, 3 oz. of currants, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Make the milk boiling, and pour it on the bread crumbs; let these remain till cold;
then add the other ingredients, taking care that the eggs are well beaten and the currants
well washed, picked, and dried. Beat the pudding well, and put it into a buttered basin; tie
it down tightly with a cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil for 1-1/4 hour; turn it
out of the basin, and serve with sifted sugar. Any odd pieces or scraps of bread answer for
this pudding; but they should be soaked overnight, and, when wanted for use, should have the
water well squeezed from them.

Time.--1-1/4 hour. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time.

    BREAD.--Bread contains, in its composition, in the form of
    vegetable albumen and vegetable fibrine, two of the chief
    constituents of flesh, and, in its incombustible constituents,
    the salts which are indispensable for sanguification, of the
    same quality and in the same proportion as flesh. But flesh
    contains, besides these, a number of substances which are
    entirely wanting in vegetable food; and on these peculiar
    constituents of flesh depend certain effects, by which it is
    essentially distinguished from other articles of food.

BROWN-BREAD PUDDING.

1253. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of brown-bread crumbs, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1/2 lb. of suet, 1/4
lb. of moist sugar, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, grated nutmeg
to taste.

Mode.--Grate 3/4 lb. of crumbs from a stale brown loaf; add to these the currants and suet,
and be particular that the latter is finely chopped. Put in the remaining ingredients; beat
the pudding well for a few minutes; put it into a buttered basin or mould; tie it down tightly,
and boil for nearly 4 hours. Send sweet sauce to table with it.

MINIATURE BREAD PUDDINGS.

1254. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, 4 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, sugar
to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy, 1 teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel.

Mode.--Make the milk boiling, pour it on to the bread crumbs, and let them soak for about 1/2
hour. Beat the eggs, mix these with the bread crumbs, add the remaining ingredients, and stir
well until all is thoroughly mixed. A few currants may be added to these puddings: about 3
oz. will be found sufficient for the above quantity.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 small puddings.

Seasonable at any time.

BAKED BREAD-AND-BUTTER PUDDING.

1255. INGREDIENTS.--9 thin slices of bread and butter, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 4 eggs, sugar to
taste, 1/4 lb. of currants, flavouring of vanilla, grated lemon-peel or nutmeg.

Mode.--Cut 9 slices of bread and butter not very thick, and put them into a pie-dish, with
currants between each layer and on the top. Sweeten and flavour the milk, either by infusing
a little lemon-peel in it, or by adding a few drops of essence of vanilla; well whisk the eggs,
and stir these to the milk. Strain this over the bread and butter, and bake in a moderate oven
for 1 hour, or rather longer. This pudding may be very much enriched by adding cream, candied
peel, or more eggs than stated above. It should not be turned out, but sent to table in the
pie-dish, and is better for being made about 2 hours before it is baked.

Time.--1 hour, or rather longer. Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    BUTTER.--Butter is indispensable in almost all culinary
    preparations. Good fresh butter, used in moderation, is easily
    digested; it is softening, nutritious, and fattening, and is far
    more easily digested than any other of the oleaginous substances
    sometimes used in its place.

CABINET or CHANCELLOR'S PUDDING.

1256. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of candied peel, 4 oz. of currants, 4 dozen sultanas, a few slices
of Savoy cake, sponge cake, a French roll, 4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, grated lemon-rind, 1/4 nutmeg,
3 table-spoonfuls of sugar.

Mode.--Melt some butter to a paste, and with it, well grease the mould or basin in which the
pudding is to be boiled, taking care that it is buttered in every part. Cut the peel into thin
slices, and place these in a fanciful device at the bottom of the mould, and fill in the spaces
between with currants and sultanas; then add a few slices of sponge cake or French roll; drop
a few drops of melted butter on these, and between each layer sprinkle a few currants. Proceed
in this manner until the mould is nearly full; then flavour the milk with nutmeg and grated
lemon-rind; add the sugar, and stir to this the eggs, which should be well beaten. Beat this
mixture for a few minutes; then strain it into the mould, which should be quite full; tie a
piece of buttered paper over it, and let it stand for 2 hours; then tie it down with a cloth,
put it into boiling water, and let it boil slowly for 1 hour. In taking it up, let it stand
for a minute or two before the cloth is removed; then quickly turn it out of the mould or basin,
and serve with sweet sauce separately. The flavouring of this pudding may be varied by substituting
for the lemon-rind essence of vanilla or bitter almonds; and it may be made much richer by
using cream; but this is not at all necessary.

A PLAIN CABINET or BOILED BREAD-AND-BUTTER PUDDING.

1257. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of raisins, a few thin slices of bread and butter, 3 eggs, 1 pint
of milk, sugar to taste, 1/4 nutmeg.

Mode.--Butter a pudding-basin, and line the inside with a layer of raisins that have been previously
stoned; then nearly fill the basin with slices of bread and butter with the crust cut off,
and, in another basin, beat the eggs; add to them the milk, sugar, and grated nutmeg; mix all
well together, and pour the whole on to the bread and butter; let it stand 1/2 hour, then tie
a floured cloth over it; boil for 1 hour, and serve with sweet sauce. Care must be taken that
the basin is quite full before the cloth is tied over.

CANARY PUDDING.

1258. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 3 eggs in sugar and butter, the weight of 2 eggs in flour,
the rind of 1 small lemon, 3 eggs.

Mode.--Melt the butter to a liquid state, but do not allow it to oil; stir to this the sugar
and finely-minced lemon-peel, and gradually dredge in the flour, keeping the mixture well stirred;
whisk the eggs; add these to the pudding; beat all the ingredients until thoroughly blended,
and put them into a buttered mould or basin; boil for 2 hours, and serve with sweet sauce.

BAKED OR BOILED CARROT PUDDING.

1259. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, 4 oz. of suet, 1/4 lb. of stoned raisins, 3/4
lb. of carrot, 1/4 lb. of currants, 3 oz. of sugar, 3 eggs, milk, 1/4 nutmeg. If to be boiled,
put the mixture into a buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, and boil for 2-1/2 hours:
if to be baked, put it into a pie-dish, and bake for nearly an hour; turn it out of the dish,
strew sifted sugar over it, and serve.

Time.--2-1/2 hours to boil; 1 hour to bake.

    CARROTS, says Liebig, contain the same kind of sugar as the
    juice of the sugar-cane.

ROYAL COBURG PUDDING.

1260. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of new milk, 6 oz. of flour, 6 oz. of sugar, 6 oz. of butter, 6
oz. of currants, 6 eggs, brandy and grated nutmeg to taste.

Mode.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter with the milk, add the remaining ingredients gradually,
and when well mixed, put it into four basins or moulds half full; bake for 3/4 hour, turn the
puddings out on a dish, and serve with wine sauce.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time.

CHERRY TART.

1261. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of cherries, 2 small tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, 1/2 lb. of
short crust, No. 1210 or 1211.

Mode.--Pick the stalks from the cherries, put them, with the sugar, into a deep pie-dish just
capable of holding them, with a small cup placed upside down in the midst of them. Make a short
crust with 1/2 lb. of flour, by either of the recipes 1210 or 1211; lay a border round the
edge of the dish; put on the cover, and ornament the edges; bake in a brisk oven from 1/2 hour
to 40 minutes; strew finely-sifted sugar over, and serve hot or cold, although the latter is
the more usual mode. It is more economical to make two or three tarts at one time, as the trimmings
from one tart answer for lining the edges of the dish for another, and so much paste is not
required as when they are made singly. Unless for family use, never make fruit pies in very
large dishes; select them, however, as deep as possible.

Time.--1/2 hour to 40 minutes.

Average cost, in full season, 8d.

Note.--A few currants added to the cherries will be found to impart a nice piquant taste to them.

    CHERRIES.--According to Lucullus, the cherry-tree was known in
    Asia in the year of Rome 680. Seventy different species of
    cherries, wild and cultivated, exist, which are distinguishable
    from each other by the difference of their form, size, and
    colour. The French distil from cherries a liqueur Darned
    kirsch-waser (eau de cérises); the Italians prepare, from a
    cherry called marusca, the liqueur named marasquin, sweeter
    and more agreeable than the former. The most wholesome cherries
    have a tender and delicate skin; those with a hard skin should
    be very carefully masticated. Sweetmeats, syrups, tarts,
    entremets, &c., of cherries, are universally approved.

COLD PUDDING.

1262. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, sugar to taste, a little grated lemon-rind, 2 oz.
of raisins, 4 tablespoonfuls of marmalade, a few slices of sponge cake.

Mode.--Sweeten the milk with lump sugar, add a little grated lemon-rind, and stir to this the
eggs, which should be well whisked; line a buttered mould with the raisins, stoned and cut
in half; spread the slices of cake with the marmalade, and place them in the mould; then pour
in the custard, tie the pudding down with paper and a cloth, and boil gently for 1 hour: when
cold, turn it out, and serve.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost, 1s. 1d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

COLLEGE PUDDINGS.

1263. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of bread crumbs, 6 oz. of finely-chopped suet, 1/4 lb. of currants,
a few thin slices of candied peel, 3 oz. of sugar, 1/4 nutmeg, 3 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of brandy.

Mode.--Put the bread crumbs into a basin; add the suet, currants, candied peel, sugar, and
nutmeg, grated, and stir these ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed. Beat up the eggs,
moisten the pudding with these, and put in the brandy; beat well for a few minutes, then form
the mixture into round balls or egg-shaped pieces; fry these in hot butter or lard, letting
them stew in it until thoroughly done, and turn them two or three times, till of a fine light
brown; drain them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire; dish, and serve with wine sauce.

Time.--15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 puddings. Seasonable at any time.

CURRANT DUMPLINGS.

1264. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of suet, 1/2 lb. of currants, rather more than 1/2
pint of water.

Mode.--Chop the suet finely, mix it with the flour, and add the currants, which should be nicely
washed, picked, and dried; mix the whole to a limp paste with the water (if wanted very nice,
use milk); divide it into 7 or 8 dumplings; tie them in cloths, and boil for 1-1/4 hour. They
may be boiled without a cloth: they should then be made into round balls, and dropped into
boiling water, and should be moved about at first, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom
of the saucepan. Serve with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted sugar.

Time.--In a cloth, 1-1/4 hour; without, 3/4 hour.

Average cost, 9 d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

    ZANTE CURRANTS.--The dried fruit which goes by the name of
    currants in grocers' shops is not a currant really, but a small
    kind of grape, chiefly cultivated in the Morea and the Ionian
    Islands, Corfu, Zante, &c. Those of Zante are cultivated in an
    immense plain, under the shelter of mountains, on the shore of
    the island, where the sun has great power, and brings them to
    maturity. When gathered and dried by the sun and air, on mats,
    they are conveyed to magazines, heaped together, and left to
    cake, until ready for shipping. They are then dug out by iron
    crowbars, trodden into casks, and exported. The fertile vale of
    "Zante the woody" produces about 9,000,000 lbs. of currants
    annually. In cakes and puddings this delicious little grape is
    most extensively used; in fact, we could not make a plum pudding
    without the currant.

BOILED CURRANT PUDDING.

(Plain and Economical.)

1265.

BLACK or RED CURRANT PUDDING.

1266. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of red or black currants, measured with the stalks, 1/4 lb. of
moist sugar, suet crust No. 1215, or butter crust No. 1213.

Mode.--Make, with 3/4 lb. of flour, either a suet crust or butter crust (the former is usually
made); butter a basin, and line it with part of the crust; put in the currants, which should
be stripped from the stalks, and sprinkle the sugar over them; put the cover of the pudding
on; make the edges very secure, that the juice does not escape; tie it down with a floured
cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil from 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Boiled without a basin, allow
1/2 hour less. We have allowed rather a large proportion of sugar; but we find fruit puddings
are so much more juicy and palatable when well sweetened before they are boiled, besides being
more economical. A few raspberries added to red-currant pudding are a very nice addition: about
1/2 pint would be sufficient for the above quantity of fruit. Fruit puddings are very delicious
if, when they are turned out of the basin, the crust is browned with a salamander, or put into
a very hot oven for a few minutes to colour it: this makes it crisp on the surface.

Time.--2-1/2 to 3 hours; without a basin, 2 to 2-1/2 hours.

Average cost, in full season, 8d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable in June, July, and August.

    CURRANTS.--The utility of currants, red, black, or white, has
    long been established in domestic economy. The juice of the red
    species, if boiled with an equal weight of loaf sugar, forms an
    agreeable substance called currant jelly, much employed in
    sauces, and very valuable in the cure of sore throats and colds.
    The French mix it with sugar and water, and thus form an
    agreeable beverage. The juice of currants is a valuable remedy
    in obstructions of the bowels; and, in febrile complaints, it is
    useful on account of its readily quenching thirst, and for its
    cooling effect on the stomach. White and flesh-coloured
    currants have, with the exception of the fullness of flavour, in
    every respect, the same qualities as the red species. Both white
    and red currants are pleasant additions to the dessert, but the
    black variety is mostly used for culinary and medicinal
    purposes, especially in the form of jelly for quinsies. The
    leaves of the black currant make a pleasant tea.

RED-CURRANT AND RASPBERRY TART.

1267.

Mode.--Strip the currants from the stalks, and put them into a deep pie-dish, with a small
cup placed in the midst, bottom upwards; add the raspberries and sugar; place a border of paste
round the edge of the dish, cover with crust, ornament the edges, and bake from 1/2 to 3/4
hour: strew some sifted sugar over before being sent to table. This tart is more generally
served cold than hot.

    RASPBERRIES.--There are two sorts of raspberries, the red and
    the white. Both the scent and flavour of this fruit are very
    refreshing, and the berry itself is exceedingly wholesome, and
    invaluable to people of a nervous or bilious temperament. We are
    not aware, however, of its being cultivated with the same amount
    of care which is bestowed upon some other of the berry tribe,
    although it is far from improbable that a more careful
    cultivation would not be repaid by a considerable improvement in
    the size and flavour of the berry; neither, as an eating fruit,
    is it so universally esteemed as the strawberry, with whose
    lusciousness and peculiarly agreeable flavour it can bear no
    comparison. In Scotland, it is found in large quantities,
    growing wild, and is eagerly sought after, in the woods, by
    children. Its juice is rich and abundant, and to many, extremely
    agreeable.

BAKED CUSTARD PUDDING.

1268. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, the rind of 1/4 lemon, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 4 eggs.

Mode.--Put the milk into a saucepan with the sugar and lemon-rind, and let this infuse for
about 4 hour, or until the milk is well flavoured; whisk the eggs, yolks and whites; pour the
milk to them, stirring all the while; then have ready a pie-dish, lined at the edge with paste
ready baked; strain the custard into the dish, grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake
in a very slow oven for about 1/2 hour, or rather longer. The flavour of this pudding may be
varied by substituting bitter almonds for the lemon-rind; and it may be very much enriched
by using half cream and half milk, and doubling the quantity of eggs.

BOILED CUSTARD PUDDING.

1269. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 4 eggs, flavouring to taste.

Mode.--Flavour the milk by infusing in it a little lemon-rind or cinnamon; whisk the eggs,
stir the flour gradually to these, and pour over them the milk, and stir the mixture well.
Butter a basin that will exactly hold it; put in the custard, and tie a floured cloth over;
plunge it into boiling water, and turn it about for a few minutes, to prevent the flour from
settling in one part. Boil it slowly for 1/2 hour; turn it out of the basin, and serve. The
pudding may be garnished with red-currant jelly, and sweet sauce may be sent to table with it.

Time.--1/2 hour.

DAMSON TART.

1270. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 pint of damsons, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 1/2 lb. of short or puff
crust. If puff-crust is used, about 10 minutes before the pie is done, take it out of the oven,
brush it over with the white of an egg beaten to a froth with the blade of a knife; strew some
sifted sugar over, and a few drops of water, and put the tart back to finish baking: with short
crust, a little plain sifted sugar, sprinkled over, is all that will be required.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable in September and October.

    DAMSONS.--Whether for jam, jelly, pie, pudding, water, ice,
    wine, dried fruit or preserved, the damson, or damascene (for
    it was originally brought from Damascus, whence its name), is
    invaluable. It combines sugary and acid qualities in happy
    proportions, when full ripe. It is a fruit easily cultivated;
    and, if budded nine inches from the ground on vigorous stocks,
    it will grow several feet high in the first year, and make fine
    standards the year following. Amongst the list of the best sorts
    of baking plums, the damson stands first, not only on account of
    the abundance of its juice, but also on account of its soon
    softening. Because of the roughness of its flavour, it requires
    a large quantity of sugar.

DAMSON PUDDING.

1271. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of damsons, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 3/4 lb. of suet or butter crust.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable in September and October.

DELHI PUDDING.

1272. INGREDIENTS.--4 large apples, a little grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel,
2 large tablespoonfuls of sugar, 6 oz. of currants, 3/4 lb. of suet crust No. 1215.

Seasonable from August to March.

EMPRESS PUDDING.

1273. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice, 2 oz. of butter, 3 eggs, jam, sufficient milk to soften
the rice.

Mode.--Boil the rice in the milk until very soft; then add the butter boil it for a few minutes
after the latter ingredient is put in, and set it by to cool. Well beat the eggs, stir these
in, and line a dish with puff-paste; put over this a layer of rice, then a thin layer of any
kind of jam, then another layer of rice, and proceed in this manner until the dish is full;
and bake in a moderate oven for 3/4 hour. This pudding may be eaten hot or cold; if the latter,
it will be much improved by having a boiled custard poured over it.

EXETER PUDDING.

(Very rich.)

1274. INGREDIENTS.--10 oz. of bread crumbs, 4 oz. of sago, 7 oz. of finely-chopped suet, 6
oz. of moist sugar, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 1/4 pint of rum, 7 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream,
4 small sponge cakes, 2 oz. of ratafias, 1/2 lb. of jam.

Mode.--Put the bread crumbs into a basin with the sago, suet, sugar, minced lemon-peel, rum,
and 4 eggs; stir these ingredients well together, then add 3 more eggs and the cream, and let
the mixture be well beaten. Then butter a mould, strew in a few bread crumbs, and cover the
bottom with a layer of ratafias; then put in a layer of the mixture, then a layer of sliced
sponge cake spread thickly with any kind of jam; then add some ratafias, then some of the mixture
and sponge cake, and so on until the mould is full, taking care that a layer of the mixture
is on the top of the pudding. Bake in a good oven from 3/4 to 1 hour, and serve with the following
sauce:--Put 3 tablespoonfuls of black-currant jelly into a stewpan, add 2 glasses of sherry,
and, when warm, turn the pudding out of the mould, pour the sauce over it, and serve hot.

Time.--From 1 to 1-1/4 hour. Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time.

mix these well together, add the flour, the eggs, which should be well beaten, and sufficient
milk to form the whole into a stiff paste; butter a mould or basin, press the pudding into
it very closely, tie it down with a cloth, and boil for 3 hours, or rather longer; turn it
out of the mould, and serve with melted butter, wine-sauce, or cream.

Time.--3 hours, or longer. Average cost, 2s.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable.--Suitable for a winter pudding.

(Staffordshire Recipe.)

1276. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of figs, 6 oz. of suet, 3/4 lb. of flour, milk.

Mode.--Chop the suet finely, mix with it the flour, and make these into a smooth paste with
milk; roll it out to the thickness of about 1/2 inch, cut the figs in small pieces, and strew
them over the paste; roll it up, make the ends secure, tie the pudding in a cloth, and boil
it from 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

FOLKESTONE PUDDING-PIES.

1277. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 3 oz. of ground rice, 3 oz. of butter, 1/4 lb. of sugar,
flavouring of lemon-peel or bay-leaf, 6 eggs, puff-paste, currants.

Mode.--Infuse 2 laurel or bay leaves, or the rind of 1/2 lemon, in the milk, and when it is
well flavoured, strain it, and add the rice; boil these for 1/4 hour, stirring all the time;
then take them off the fire, stir in the butter, sugar, and eggs, and let these latter be well
beaten before they are added to the other ingredients; when nearly cold, line some patty-pans
with puff-paste, fill with the custard, strew over each a few currants, and bake from 20 to
25 minutes in a moderate oven.

Time.--20 to 25 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 1d.

Sufficient to fill a dozen patty-pans.

1278. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste No. 1206, any kind of fruit, sugar to taste.

Mode.--Make some puff-paste by recipe No. 1206; roll it out to the thickness of about 1/4 inch,
and cut it out in pieces of a circular form; pile the fruit on half of the paste, sprinkle
over some sugar, wet the edges and turn the paste over. Press the edges together, ornament
them, and brush the turnovers over with the white of an egg; sprinkle over sifted sugar, and
bake on tins, in a brisk oven, for about 20 minutes. Instead of putting the fruit in raw, it
may be boiled down with a little sugar first, and then inclosed in the crust; or jam, of any
kind, may be substituted for fresh fruit.

Time.--20 minutes.

Sufficient--1/2 lb. of puff-paste will make a dozen turnovers.

Seasonable at any time.

GERMAN PUDDING.

1279. INGREDIENTS.--2 teaspoonfuls of flour, 1 teaspoonful of arrowroot, 1 pint of milk, 2
oz. of butter, sugar to taste, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 4 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of brandy.

Mode.--Boil the milk with the lemon-rind until well flavoured; then strain it, and mix with
it the flour, arrowroot, butter, and sugar. Boil these ingredients for a few minutes, keeping
them well stirred; then take them off the fire and mix with them the eggs, yolks and whites,
beaten separately and added separately. Boil some sugar to candy; line a mould with this, put
in the brandy, then the mixture; tie down with a cloth, and boil for rather more than 1 hour.
When turned out, the brandy and sugar make a nice sauce.

DAMPFNUDELN, or GERMAN PUDDINGS.

1280. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of butter, 5 eggs, 2 small tablespoonfuls of yeast,
2 tablespoonfuls of finely-pounded sugar, milk, a very little salt.

Mode.--Put the flour into a basin, make a hole in the centre, into which put the yeast, and
rather more than 1/4 pint of warm milk; make this into a batter with the middle of the flour,
and let the sponge rise in a warm temperature. When sufficiently risen, mix the eggs, butter,
sugar, and salt with a little more warm milk, and knead the whole well together with the hands,
beating the dough until it is perfectly smooth, and it drops from the fingers. Then cover the
basin with a cloth, put it in a warm place, and when the dough has nicely risen, knead it into
small balls; butter the bottom of a deep sauté-pan, strew over some pounded sugar, and let
the dampfnudeln be laid in, but do not let them touch one another; then pour over sufficient
milk to cover them, put on the lid, and let them rise to twice their original size by the side
of the fire. Now place them in the oven for a few minutes, to acquire a nice brown colour,
and serve them on a napkin, with custard sauce flavoured with vanilla, or a compôte of any
fruit that may be preferred.

Time.--1/2 to 3/4 hour for the sponge to rise; 10 to 15 minutes for the puddings to rise; 10
minutes to bake them in a brisk oven.

Sufficient for 10 or 12 dampfnudeln.

Seasonable at any time.

GINGER PUDDING.

1281. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of suet, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 2 large teaspoonfuls
of grated ginger.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

GOLDEN PUDDING.

1282.

Mode.--Put the bread crumbs into a basin; mix with them the suet, which should be finely minced,
the marmalade, and the sugar; stir all these ingredients well together, beat the eggs to a
froth, moisten the pudding with these, and when well mixed, put it into a mould or buttered
basin; tie down with a floured cloth, and boil for 2 hours. When turned out, strew a little
fine-sifted sugar over the top, and serve.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, 11d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The mould may be ornamented with stoned raisins, arranged in any fanciful pattern, before
the mixture is poured in, which would add very much to the appearance of the pudding. For a
plainer pudding, double the quantities of the bread crumbs, and if the eggs do not moisten
it sufficiently, use a little milk.

BAKED GOOSEBERRY PUDDING.

1283. INGREDIENTS.--Gooseberries, 3 eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of bread crumbs, sugar
to taste.

Time.--About 40 minutes. Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from May to July.

BOILED GOOSEBERRY PUDDING.

1284. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of suet crust No. 1215, 1-1/2 pint of green gooseberries, 1/4 lb.
of moist sugar.

Mode.--Line a pudding-basin with suet crust no. 1215, rolled out to about 1/2 inch in thickness,
and, with a pair of scissors, cut off the tops and tails of the gooseberries; fill the basin
with the fruit, put in the sugar, and cover with crust.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable from May to July.

GOOSEBERRY TART.

1285. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of gooseberries, 1/2 lb. of short crust No. 1211, 1/4 lb. of
moist sugar.

Mode.--With a pair of scissors cut off the tops and tails of the gooseberries; put them into
a deep pie-dish, pile the fruit high in the centre, and put in the sugar; line the edge of
the dish with short crust, put on the cover, and ornament the edges of the tart; bake in a
good oven for about 3/4 hour, and before being sent to table, strew over it some fine-sifted
sugar. A jug of cream, or a dish of boiled or baked custards, should always accompany this dish.

    GOOSEBERRIES.--The red and the white are the two principal
    varieties of gooseberries. The red are rather the more acid;
    but, when covered with white sugar, are most wholesome, because
    the sugar neutralizes their acidity. Red gooseberries make an
    excellent jelly, which is light and refreshing, but not very
    nourishing. It is good for bilious and plethoric persons, and to
    invalids generally who need light and digestible food. It is a
    fruit from which many dishes might be made. All sorts of
    gooseberries are agreeable when stewed, and, in this country
    especially, there is no fruit so universally in favour. In
    Scotland, there is scarcely a cottage-garden without its
    gooseberry-bush. Several of the species are cultivated with the
    nicest care.

HALF-PAY PUDDING.

1286. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of suet, 1/4 lb. of currants, 1/4 lb. of raisins, 1/4 lb. of flour,
1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of treacle, 1/2 pint of milk.

Mode.--Chop the suet finely; mix with it the currants, which should be nicely washed and dried,
the raisins, which should be stoned, the flour, bread crumbs, and treacle; moisten with the
milk, beat up the ingredients until all are thoroughly mixed, put them into a buttered basin,
and boil the pudding for 3-1/2 hours.

Time.--3-1/2 hours.

Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

HERODOTUS PUDDING.

1287.

Mode.--Mince the suet and figs very finely; add the remaining ingredients, taking care that
the eggs are well whisked; beat the mixture for a few minutes, put it into a buttered mould,
tie it down with a floured cloth, and boil the pudding for 5 hours. Serve with wine sauce.

Time.--5 hours.

HUNTER'S PUDDING.

1288. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of raisins, 1 lb. of currants, 1 lb. of suet, 1 lb. of bread crumbs,
3 lb. of moist sugar, 8 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 3 lb. of mixed candied peel, 1 glass
of brandy, 10 drops of essence of lemon, 10 drops of essence of almonds, 1/2 nutmeg, 2 blades
of mace, 6 cloves.

Mode.--Stone and shred the raisins rather small, chop the suet finely, and rub the bread until
all lumps are well broken; pound the spice to powder, cut the candied peel into thin shreds,
and mix all these ingredients well together, adding the sugar. Beat the eggs to a strong froth,
and as they are beaten, drop into them the essence of lemon and essence of almonds; stir these
to the dry ingredients, mix well, and add the brandy. Tie the pudding firmly in a cloth, and
boil it for 6 hours at the least: 7 or 8 hours would be still better for it. Serve with boiled
custard, or red-currant jelly, or brandy sauce.

Time.--6 to 8 hours.

Average cost, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient for 9 or 10 persons.

Seasonable in winter.

ICED PUDDING.

(Parisian Recipe.)

1289. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of sweet almonds, 2 oz. of bitter ones, 3/4 lb. of sugar, 8 eggs,
1-1/2 pint of milk.

Mode.--Blanch and dry the almonds thoroughly in a cloth, then pound them in a mortar until
reduced to a smooth paste; add to these the well-beaten eggs, the sugar, and milk; stir these
ingredients over the fire until they thicken, but do not allow them to boil; then strain and
put the mixture into the freezing-pot; surround it with ice, and freeze it as directed in recipe
1290. When quite frozen, fill an iced-pudding mould, put on the lid, and keep the pudding in
ice until required for table; then turn it out on the dish, and garnish it with a compôte of
any fruit that may be preferred, pouring a little over the top of the pudding. This pudding
may be flavoured with vanilla, Curaçoa, or Maraschino.

Time.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.

Seasonable.--Served all the year round.

ICED APPLE PUDDING. (French Recipe, after Carême.)

1290. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen apples, a small pot of apricot-jam, 1/2 lb. of sugar, 1 Seville
orange, 1/4 pint of preserved cherries, 1/4 lb. of raisins, 1 oz. of citron, 2 oz. of almonds,
1 gill of Curaçoa, 1 gill of Maraschino, 1 pint of cream.

Mode.--Peel, core, and cut the apples into quarters, and simmer them over the fire until soft;
then mix with them the apricot-jam and the sugar, on which the rind of the orange should be
previously rubbed; work all these ingredients through a sieve, and put them into the freezing-pot.
Stone the raisins, and simmer them in a little syrup for a few minutes; add these, with the
sliced citron, the almonds cut in dice, and the cherries drained from their syrup, to the ingredients
in the freezing-pot; put in the Curaçoa and Maraschino, and freeze again; add as much whipped
cream as will be required, freeze again, and fill the mould. Put the lid on, and plunge the
mould into the ice-pot; cover it with a wet cloth and pounded ice and saltpetre, where it should
remain until wanted for table. Turn the pudding out of the mould on to a clean and neatly-folded
napkin, and serve, as sauce, a little iced whipped cream, in a sauce-tureen or glass dish.

Time.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.

Seasonable from August to March.

Method of working the freezing Apparatus.--Put into the outer pail some pounded ice, upon which
strew some saltpetre; then fix the pewter freezing-pot upon this, and surround it entirely
with ice and saltpetre. Wipe the cover and edges of the pot, pour in the preparation, and close
the lid; a quarter of an hour after, begin turning the freezing-pan from right to left, and
when the mixture begins to be firm round the sides of the pot, stir it about with the slice
or spattle, that the preparation may be equally congealed. Close the lid again, keep working
from right to left, and, from time to time, remove the mixture from the sides, that it may
be smooth; and when perfectly frozen, it is ready to put in the mould; the mould should then
be placed in the ice again, where it should remain until wanted for table.

ROLY-POLY JAM PUDDING.

1291. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb of suet-crust No. 1215, 3/4 lb. of any kind of jam.

Mode.--Make a nice light suet-crust by recipe No. 1215, and roll it out to the thickness of
about 1/2 inch. Spread the jam equally over it, leaving a small margin of paste without any,
where the pudding joins. Mincemeat or marmalade may be substituted for the jam, and makes excellent
puddings.

Time.--2 hours.

LEMON CHEESECAKES.

1292. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of loaf sugar, 6 eggs, the rind of 2 lemons and
the juice of 3.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, carefully grating the lemon-rind and straining
the juice. Keep stirring the mixture over the fire until the sugar is dissolved, and it begins
to thicken: when of the consistency of honey, it is done; then put it into small jars, and
keep in a dry place. This mixture will remain good 3 or 4 months. When made into cheesecakes,
add a few pounded almonds, or candied peel, or grated sweet biscuit; line some patty-pans with
good puff-paste, rather more than half fill them with the mixture, and bake for about 1/4 hour
in a good brisk oven.

Time.--1/4 hour.

Average cost, 1s. 4d.

Sufficient for 24 cheesecakes.

Seasonable at any time.

LEMON MINCEMEAT.

1293. INGREDIENTS.--2 large lemons, 6 large apples, 1/2 lb. of suet, 1 lb. of currants, 1/2
lb. of sugar, 2 oz. of candied lemon-peel, 1 oz. of citron, mixed spice to taste.

Mode.--Pare the lemons, squeeze them, and boil the peel until tender enough to mash. Add to
the mashed lemon-peel the apples, which should be pared, cored, and minced; the chopped suet,
currants, sugar, sliced peel, and spice. Strain the lemon-juice to these ingredients, stir
the mixture well, and put it in a jar with a closely-fitting lid. Stir occasionally, and in
a week or 10 days the mincemeat will be ready for use.

Average cost, 2s.

Sufficient for 18 large or 24 small pies.

Seasonable.--Make this about the beginning of December.

    LEMON.--The lemon is a variety of the citron. The juice of this
    fruit makes one of our most popular and refreshing
    beverages--lemonade, which is gently stimulating and cooling,
    and soon quenches the thirst. It may he freely partaken by
    bilious and sanguine temperaments; but persons with irritable
    stomachs should avoid it, on account of its acid qualities. The
    fresh rind of the lemon is a gentle tonic, and, when dried and
    grated, is used in flavouring a variety of culinary
    preparations. Lemons appear in company with the orange in most
    orange-growing countries. They were only known to the Romans at
    a very late period, and, at first, were used only to keep the
    moths from their garments: their acidity was unpleasant to them.
    In the time of Pliny, the lemon was hardly known otherwise than
    as an excellent counter-poison.

III.

1297. INGREDIENTS.--The rind and juice of 2 large lemons, 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar, 1/4 pint of
cream, the yolks of 8 eggs, 2 oz. of almonds, 1/2 lb. of butter, melted.

Mode.--Mix the pounded sugar with the cream, and add the yolks of eggs and the butter, which
should be previously warmed. Blanch and pound the almonds, and put these, with the grated rind
and strained juice of the lemons, to the other ingredients. Stir all well together; line a
dish with puff-paste, put in the mixture, and bake for 1 hour.

Time.--1 hour.

Average cost, 2s.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

BOILED LEMON PUDDING.

1298. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of chopped suet, 3/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 2 small lemons, 6 oz.
of moist sugar, 1/4 lb. of flour, 2 eggs, milk.

Mode.--Mix the suet, bread crumbs, sugar, and flour well together, adding the lemon-peel, which
should be very finely minced, and the juice, which should be strained.

Time.--3-1/2 hours.

Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time.

Note.--This pudding may also be baked, and will be found very good. It will take about 2 hours.

PLAIN LEMON PUDDING.

1299. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of lard or dripping, the juice of 1 large lemon,
1 teaspoonful of flour, sugar.

Mode.--Make the above proportions of flour and lard into a smooth paste, and roll it out to
the thickness of about 1/2 inch.

MANCHESTER PUDDING (to eat Cold).

1300. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of grated bread, 1/2 pint of milk, a strip of lemon-peel, 4 eggs,
2 oz. of butter, sugar to taste, puff-paste, jam, 3 tablespoonfuls of brandy.

Mode.--Flavour the milk with lemon-peel, by infusing it in the milk for 1/2 hour; then strain
it on to the bread crumbs, and boil it for 2 or 3 minutes; add the eggs, leaving out the whites
of 2, the butter, sugar, and brandy; stir all these ingredients well together; cover a pie-dish
with puff-paste, and at the bottom put a thick layer of any kind of jam; pour the above mixture,
cold, on the jam, and bake the pudding for an hour. Serve cold, with a little sifted sugar
sprinkled over.

Time.--1 hour.

SWEET MACARONI PUDDING.

1301. INGREDIENTS.--2-1/2 oz. of macaroni, 2 pints of milk, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 3 eggs,
sugar and grated nutmeg to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy.

Mode.--Put the macaroni, with a pint of the milk, into a saucepan with the lemon-peel, and
let it simmer gently until the macaroni is tender; then put it into a pie-dish without the
peel; mix the other pint of milk with the eggs; stir these well together, adding the sugar
and brandy, and pour the mixture over the macaroni. Grate a little nutmeg over the top, and
bake in a moderate oven for 1/2 hour. To make this pudding look nice, a paste should be laid
round the edges of the dish, and, for variety, a layer of preserve or marmalade may be placed
on the macaroni: in this case omit the brandy.

Time.--3/4 hour to simmer the macaroni; 1/2 hour to bake the pudding.

    MACARONI is composed of wheaten flour, flavoured with other
    articles, and worked up with water into a paste, to which, by a
    peculiar process, a tubular or pipe form is given, in order that
    it may cook more readily in hot water. That of smaller diameter
    than macaroni (which is about the thickness of a goose-quill) is
    called vermicelli; and when smaller still, fidelini. The
    finest is made from the flour of the hard-grained Black-Sea
    wheat. Macaroni is the principal article of food in many parts
    of Italy, particularly Naples, where the best is manufactured,
    and from whence, also, it is exported in considerable
    quantities. In this country, macaroni and vermicelli are
    frequently used in soups.

MANNA KROUP PUDDING.

1302. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of manna kroup, 12 bitter almonds, 1 pint of milk, sugar
to taste, 3 eggs.

Mode.--Blanch and pound the almonds in a mortar; mix them with the manna kroup; pour over these
a pint of boiling milk, and let them steep for about 1/4 hour.

    MANNA KROUP, SEMORA, or SEMOLINA, are three names given to a
    flour made from ground wheat and rice. The preparation is white
    when it is made only of these materials; the yellow colour which
    it usually has, is produced by a portion of saffron and yolks of
    eggs. Next to vermicelli, this preparation is the most useful
    for thickening either meat or vegetable soups. As a food, it is
    light, nutritious, wholesome, and easily digested. The best
    preparation is brought from Arabia, and, next to that, from
    Italy.

MANSFIELD PUDDING.

1303. INGREDIENTS.--The crumb of 2 rolls, 1 pint of milk, sugar to taste, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls
of brandy, 6 oz. of chopped suet, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1/2 teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream.

Mode.--Slice the roll very thin, and pour upon it a pint of boiling milk; let it remain covered
close for 1/4 hour, then beat it up with a fork, and sweeten with moist sugar; stir in the
chopped suet, flour, currants, and nutmeg. Mix these ingredients well together, moisten with
the eggs, brandy, and cream; beat the mixture for 2 or 3 minutes, put it into a buttered dish
or mould, and bake in a moderate oven for 1-1/4 hour. 3d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time.

MARLBOROUGH PUDDING.

1304.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream, stir in the powdered sugar, whisk the eggs, and add these
to the other ingredients.

MARMALADE AND VERMICELLI PUDDING.

1305. INGREDIENTS.--1 breakfastcupful of vermicelli, 2 tablespoonfuls of marmalade, 1/4 lb.
of raisins, sugar to taste, 3 eggs, milk.

Mode.--Pour some boiling milk on the vermicelli, and let it remain covered for 10 minutes;
then mix with it the marmalade, stoned raisins, sugar, and beaten eggs. Stir all well together,
put the mixture into a buttered mould, boil for 1-1/2 hour, and serve with custard sauce.

MARROW DUMPLINGS, to serve with Roast Meat, in Soup, with Salad, &c.

(German Recipe.)

1306. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of beef marrow, 1 oz. of butter, 2 eggs, 2 penny rolls, 1 teaspoonful
of minced onion, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, salt and grated nutmeg to taste.

Mode.--Beat the marrow and butter together to a cream; well whisk the eggs, and add these to
the other ingredients. When they are well stirred, put in the rolls, which should previously
be well soaked in boiling milk, strained, and beaten up with a fork. Add the remaining ingredients,
omitting the minced onion where the flavour is very much disliked, and form the mixture into
small round dumplings. Drop these into boiling broth, and let them simmer for about 20 minutes
or 1/2 hour. They may be served in soup, with roast meat, or with salad, as in Germany, where
they are more frequently sent to table than in this country. They are very good.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 dumplings. Seasonable at any time.

BAKED OB BOILED MARROW PUDDING.

1307. Before sending it to table, sift a little pounded sugar over, after being turned out
of the mould or basin.

MILITARY PUDDINGS.

1308.

Mode.--Chop the suet finely, mix it with the bread crumbs and sugar, and mince the lemon-rind
and strain the juice; stir these into the other ingredients, mix well, and put the mixture
into small buttered cups, and bake for rather more than 1/2 hour; turn them out on the dish,
and serve with lemon-sauce. The above ingredients may be made into small balls, and boiled
for about 1/2 hour; they should then be served with the same sauce as when baked.

Time.--Rather more than 1/2 hour. Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient to fill 6 or 7 moderate-sized cups. Seasonable at any time.

MINCEMEAT.

1309. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of raisins, 3 lbs. of currants, 1-1/2 lb. of lean beef, 3 lbs. of
beef suet, 2 lbs. of moist sugar, 2 oz. of citron, 2 oz. of candied lemon-peel, 2 oz. of candied
orange-peel, 1 small nutmeg, 1 pottle of apples, the rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 1, 1/2
pint of brandy.

Mode.--Stone and cut the raisins once or twice across, but do not chop them; wash, dry, and
pick the currants free from stalks and grit, and mince the beef and suet, taking care that
the latter is chopped very fine; slice the citron and candied peel, grate the nutmeg, and pare,
core, and mince the apples; mince the lemon-peel, strain the juice, and when all the ingredients
are thus prepared, mix them well together, adding the brandy when the other things are well
blended; press the whole into a jar, carefully exclude the air, and the mincemeat will be ready
for use in a fortnight.

Average cost for this quantity, 8s.

Seasonable.--Make this about the beginning of December.

EXCELLENT MINCEMEAT.

1310. INGREDIENTS.--3 large lemons, 3 large apples, 1 lb. of stoned raisins, 1 lb. of currants,
1 lb. of suet, 2 lbs. of moist sugar, 1 oz. of sliced candied citron, 1 oz. of sliced candied
orange-peel, and the same quantity of lemon-peel, 1 teacupful of brandy, 2 tablespoonfuls of
orange marmalade.

Mode.--Grate the rinds of the lemons; squeeze out the juice, strain it, and boil the remainder
of the lemons until tender enough to pulp or chop very finely. Then add to this pulp the apples,
which should be baked, and their skins and cores removed; put in the remaining ingredients
one by one, and, as they are added, mix everything very thoroughly together. Put the mincemeat
into a stone jar with a closely-fitting lid, and in a fortnight it will be ready for use.

Seasonable.--This should be made the first or second week in December.

MINCE PIES.

1311. INGREDIENTS.--Good puff-paste No. 1205, mincemeat No. 1309.

Mode.--Make some good puff-paste by recipe No. 1205; roll it out to the thickness of about
1/4 inch, and line some good-sized pattypans with it; fill them with mincemeat, cover with
the paste, and cut it off all round close to the edge of the tin. Put the pies into a brisk
oven, to draw the paste up, and bake for 25 minutes, or longer, should the pies be very large;
brush them over with the white of an egg, beaten with the blade of a knife to a stiff froth;
sprinkle over pounded sugar, and put them into the oven for a minute or two, to dry the egg;
dish the pies on a white d'oyley, and serve hot. They may be merely sprinkled with pounded
sugar instead of being glazed, when that mode is preferred. To re-warm them, put the pies on
the pattypans, and let them remain in the oven for 10 minutes or 1/4 hour, and they will be
almost as good as if freshly made.

Time.--25 to 30 minutes; 10 minutes to re-warm them.

Average cost, 4d. each.

Sufficient--1/2 lb. of paste for 4 pies. Seasonable at Christmas time.

MONDAY'S PUDDING.

1312. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold plum-pudding, brandy, custard made with 5 eggs to every
pint of milk.

Mode.--Cut the remains of a good cold plum-pudding into finger-pieces, soak them in a little
brandy, and lay them cross-barred in a mould until full. Make a custard with the above proportion
of milk and eggs, flavouring it with nutmeg or lemon-rind; fill up the mould with it; tie it
down with a cloth, and boil or steam it for an hour. Serve with a little of the custard poured
over, to which has been added a tablespoonful of brandy.

Time.--1 hour.

Average cost, exclusive of the pudding, 6d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

NESSELRODE PUDDING. (A fashionable iced pudding--Carême's Recipe.)

1313. INGREDIENTS.--40 chestnuts, 1 lb. of sugar, flavouring of vanilla, 1 pint of cream, the
yolks of 12 eggs, 1 glass of Maraschino, 1 oz. of candied citron, 2 oz. of currants, 2 oz.
of stoned raisins, 1/2 pint of whipped cream, 3 eggs.

Mode.--Blanch the chestnuts in boiling water, remove the husks, and pound them in a mortar
until perfectly smooth, adding a few spoonfuls of syrup. Then rub them through a fine sieve,
and mix them in a basin with a pint of syrup made from 1 lb. of sugar, clarified, and flavoured
with vanilla, 1 pint of cream, and the yolks of 12 eggs. Set this mixture over a slow fire,
stirring it without ceasing, and just as it begins to boil, take it off and pass it through
a tammy. When it is cold, put it into a freezing-pot, adding the Maraschino, and make the mixture
set; then add the sliced citron, the currants, and stoned raisins (these two latter should
be soaked the day previously in Maraschino and sugar pounded with vanilla); the whole thus
mingled, add a plateful of whipped cream mixed with the whites of 3 eggs, beaten to a froth
with a little syrup. When the pudding is perfectly frozen, put it into a pineapple-shaped mould;
close the lid, place it again in the freezing-pan, covered over with pounded ice and saltpetre,
and let it remain until required for table; then turn the pudding out, and serve.

Time.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.

Seasonable from October to February.

BAKED ORANGE PUDDING.

1314. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of stale sponge cake or bruised ratafias, 6 oranges, 1 pint of milk,
6 eggs, 1/2 lb. of sugar.

Mode.--Bruise the sponge cake or ratafias into fine crumbs, and pour upon them the milk, which
should be boiling. Rub the rinds of 2 of the oranges on sugar, and add this, with the juice
of the remainder, to the other ingredients. Beat up the eggs, stir them in, sweeten to taste,
and put the mixture into a pie-dish previously lined with puff-paste.

    ORANGE (Citrus Aurantium).--The principal varieties are the
    sweet, or China orange, and the bitter, or Seville orange; the
    Maltese is also worthy of notice, from its red blood-like pulp.
    The orange is extensively cultivated in the south of Europe, and
    in Devonshire, on walls with a south aspect, it bears an
    abundance of fruit. So great is the increase in the demand for
    the orange, and so ample the supply, that it promises to rival
    the apple in its popularity. The orange-tree is considered young
    at the age of a hundred years. The pulp of the orange consists
    of a collection of oblong vesicles filled with a sugary and
    refreshing juice. The orange blossom is proverbially chosen for
    the bridal wreath, and, from the same flower, an essential oil
    is extracted hardly less esteemed than the celebrated ottar of
    roses. Of all marmalades, that made from the Seville orange is
    the best. The peel and juice of the orange are much used in
    culinary preparations. From oranges are made preserves,
    comfitures, jellies, glacés, sherbet, liqueurs, and syrups. The
    juice of the orange in a glass d'eau sucrée makes a refreshing
    and wholesome drink. From the clarified pulp of the orange the
    French make a delicious jelly, which they serve in small pots,
    and call crême. The rasped peel of the orange is used in
    several sweet entremets, to which it communicates its perfume.
    The confectioner manufactures a variety of dainties from all
    parts of the orange. Confections of orange-peel are excellent
    tonics and stomachics. Persons with delicate stomachs should
    abstain from oranges at dessert, because their acidity is likely
    to derange the digestive organs.

SMALL DISHES OF PASTRY FOE ENTREMETS, SUPPER-DISHES, &c.

FANCHONNETTES, or CUSTARD TARTLETS.

1315. INGREDIENTS.--For the custard, 4 eggs, 3/4 pint of milk, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of pounded
sugar, 3 dessertspoonfuls of flour, flavouring to taste; the whites of 2 eggs, 2 oz. of pounded
sugar.

Mode.--Well beat the eggs; stir to them the milk, the butter, which should be beaten to a cream,
the sugar, and flour; mix these ingredients well together, put them into a very clean saucepan,
and bring them to the simmering point, but do not allow them to boil. Flavour with essence
of vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon, grated chocolate, or any flavouring ingredient that may
be preferred. Line some round tartlet-pans with good puff-paste; fill them with the custard,
and bake in a moderate oven for about 20 minutes; then take them out of the pans; let them
cool, and in the mean time whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth; stir into this the
pounded sugar, and spread smoothly over the tartlets a little of this mixture. Put them in
the oven again to set the icing, but be particular that they do not scorch: when the icing
looks crisp, they are done. Arrange them, piled high in the centre, on a white napkin, and
garnish the dish, and in between the tartlets, with strips of bright jelly, or very firmly-made
preserve.

Time.--20 minutes to bake the tartlets; 5 minutes after being iced.

Average cost, exclusive of the paste, 1s.

Sufficient to fill 10 or 12 tartlets.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The icing may be omitted on the top of the tartlets, and a spoonful of any kind of preserve
put at the bottom of the custard instead: this varies both the flavour and appearance of this dish.

ALMOND FLOWERS.

1316. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste No. 1205; to every 1/2 lb. of paste allow 3 oz. of almonds,
sifted sugar, the white of an egg.

Mode.--Roll the paste out to the thickness of 1/4 inch, and, with a round fluted cutter, stamp
out as many pieces as may be required. Work the paste up again, roll it out, and, with a smaller
cutter, stamp out some pieces the size of a shilling. Brush the larger pieces over with the
white of an egg, and place one of the smaller pieces on each. Blanch and cut the almonds into
strips lengthwise; press them slanting into the paste closely round the rings; and when they
are all completed, sift over some pounded sugar, and bake for about 1/4 hour or 20 minutes.
Garnish between the almonds with strips of apple jelly, and place in the centre of the ring
a small quantity of strawberry jam; pile them high on the dish, and serve.

Time.--1/4 hour or 20 minutes.

Sufficient.--18 or 20 for a dish.

Seasonable at any time.

FLUTED ROLLS.

1317. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste, the white of an egg, sifted sugar, jelly or preserve.

Mode.--Make some good puff-paste by recipe No. 1205 (trimmings answer very well for little
dishes of this sort); roll it out to the thickness of 1/4 inch, and, with a round fluted paste-cutter,
stamp out as many round pieces as may be required; brush over the upper side with the white
of an egg; roll up the pieces, pressing the paste lightly together where it joins; place the
rolls on a baking-sheet, and bake for about 1/4 hour. A few minutes before they are done, brush
them over with the white of an egg; strew over sifted sugar, put them back in the oven; and
when the icing is firm and of a pale brown colour, they are done. Place a strip of jelly or
preserve across each roll, dish them high on a napkin, and serve cold.

Time.--1/4 hour before being iced; 5 to 10 minutes after.

Average cost, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient.--1/2 lb. of puff-paste for 2 dishes.

Seasonable at any time.

PASTRY SANDWICHES.

1318. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste, jam of any kind, the white of an egg, sifted sugar.

Mode.--Roll the paste out thin; put half of it on a baking-sheet or tin, and spread equally
over it apricot, greengage, or any preserve that may be preferred. Lay over this preserve another
thin paste; press the edges together all round; and mark the paste in lines with a knife on
the surface, to show where to cut it when baked. Bake from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; and, a short
time before being done, take the pastry out of the oven, brush it over with the white of an
egg, sift over pounded sugar, and put it back in the oven to colour. When cold, cut it into
strips; pile these on a dish pyramidically, and serve. These strips, cut about 2 inches long,
piled in circular rows, and a plateful of flavoured whipped cream poured in the middle, make
a very pretty dish.

Time.--20 minutes to 1 hour. Average cost, with 1/2 lb. of paste, 1s.

Sufficient.--1/2 lb. of paste will make 2 dishes of sandwiches.

Seasonable at any time.

PETITES BOUCHEES.

1319. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of sweet almonds, 1/4 lb. of sifted sugar, the rind of 1/2 lemon,
the white of 1 egg, puff-paste.

Mode.--Blanch the almonds, and chop them fine; rub the sugar on the lemon-rind, and pound it
in a mortar; mix this with the almonds and the white of the egg. Roll some puff-paste out;
cut it in any shape that may be preferred, such as diamonds, rings, ovals, &c., and spread
the above mixture over the paste. Bake the bouchées in an oven, not too hot, and serve cold.

Time.--1/4 hour, or rather more. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 1/2 lb. of puff-paste. Seasonable at any time.

POLISH TARTLETS.

1320. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste, the white of an egg, pounded sugar.

Mode.--Roll some good puff-paste out thin, and cut it into 2-1/2-inch squares; brush each square
over with the white of an egg, then fold down the corners, so that they all meet in the middle
of each piece of paste; slightly press the two pieces together, brush them over with the egg,
sift over sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for about 1/4 hour. When they are done, make
a little hole in the middle of the paste, and fill it up with apricot jam, marmalade, or red-currant
jelly. Pile them high in the centre of a dish, on a napkin, and garnish with the same preserve
the tartlets are filled with.

Sufficient for 2 dishes of pastry.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--It should be borne in mind, that, for all dishes of small pastry, such as the preceding,
trimmings of puff-pasty, left from larger tarts, answer as well as making the paste expressly.

PUITS d'AMOUR, or PUFF-PASTE RINGS.

1321. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste No. 1205, the white of an egg, sifted loaf sugar. Again stamp
out the centre of these smaller rings; brush over the others with the white of an egg, place
a small ring on the top of every large circular piece of paste, egg over the tops, and bake
from 15 to 20 minutes. Sift over sugar, put them back in the oven to colour them; then fill
the rings with preserve of any bright colour. Dish them high on a napkin, and serve. So many
pretty dishes of pastry may be made by stamping puff-paste out with fancy cutters, and filling
the pieces, when baked, with jelly or preserve, that our space will not allow us to give a
separate recipe for each of them; but, as they are all made from one paste, and only the shape
and garnishing varied, perhaps it is not necessary, and by exercising a little ingenuity, variety
may always be obtained. Half-moons, leaves, diamonds, stars, shamrocks, rings, etc., are the
most appropriate shapes for fancy pastry.

Time.--15 to 25 minutes.

PARADISE PUDDING.

1322. INGREDIENTS.--3 eggs, 3 apples, 1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 3 oz. of sugar, 3 oz. of currants,
salt and grated nutmeg to taste, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 wineglassful of brandy.

PEASE PUDDING.

1323. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of split peas, 2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Put the peas to soak over-night, in rain-water, and float off any that are wormeaten
or discoloured. Tie them loosely in a clean cloth, leaving a little room for them to swell,
and put them on to boil in cold rain-water, allowing 2-1/2 hours after the water has simmered
up. When the peas are tender, take them up and drain; rub them through a colander with a wooden
spoon; add the butter, eggs, pepper, and salt; beat all well together for a few minutes, until
the ingredients are well incorporated; then tie them tightly in a floured cloth; boil the pudding
for another hour, turn it on to the dish, and serve very hot. This pudding should always be
sent to table with boiled leg of pork, and is an exceedingly nice accompaniment to boiled beef.

Time.--2-1/2 hours to boil the peas, tied loosely in the cloth; 1 hour for the pudding.

Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from September to March.

BAKED PLUM-PUDDING.

1324. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of currants, 1 lb. of raisins, 1 lb. of suet, 2
eggs, 1 pint of milk, a few slices of candied peel. For a very plain pudding, use only half
the quantity of fruit, omit the eggs, and substitute milk or water for them. The above ingredients
make a large family pudding; for a small one, half the quantity would be found ample; but it
must be baked quite 1-1/2 hour.

Seasonable in winter.

    RAISIN GRAPE.--All the kinds of raisins have much the same
    virtues; they are nutritive and balsamic, but they are very
    subject to fermentation with juices of any kind; and hence, when
    eaten immoderately, they often bring on colics. There are many
    varieties of grape used for raisins; the fruit of Valencia is
    that mostly dried for culinary purposes, whilst most of the
    table kinds are grown in Malaga, and called Muscatels. The
    finest of all table raisins come from Provence or Italy; the
    most esteemed of all are those of Roquevaire; they are very
    large and very sweet. This sort is rarely eaten by any but the
    most wealthy. The dried Malaga, or Muscatel raisins, which come
    to this country packed in small boxes, and nicely preserved in
    bunches, are variable in their quality, but mostly of a rich
    flavour, when new, juicy, and of a deep purple hue.

AN EXCELLENT PLUM-PUDDING, made without Eggs.

1325.

Mode.--Mix the flour, currants, suet, and sugar well together; have ready the above proportions
of mashed carrot and potato, which stir into the other ingredients; add the treacle and lemon-peel;
but put no liquid in the mixture, or it will be spoiled. Tie it loosely in a cloth, or, if
put in a basin, do not quite fill it, as the pudding should have room to swell, and boil it
for 4 hours. Serve with brandy-sauce. This pudding is better for being mixed over-night.

AN UNRIVALLED PLUM-PUDDING.

1326. Mix all the dry ingredients well together, and moisten with the eggs, which should be
well beaten and strained, to the pudding; stir in the brandy, and, when all is thoroughly mixed,
well butter and flour a stout new pudding-cloth; put in the pudding, tie it down very tightly
and closely, boil from 6 to 8 hours, and serve with brandy-sauce. A few sweet almonds, blanched
and cut in strips, and stuck on the pudding, ornament it prettily. This quantity may be divided
and boiled in buttered moulds. For small families this is the most desirable way, as the above
will be found to make a pudding of rather large dimensions.

Time.--6 to 8 hours. Average cost, 7s. 6d.

Seasonable in winter. Sufficient for 12 or 14 persons.

Note.--The muscatel raisins can be purchased at a cheap rate loose (not in bunches): they are
then scarcely higher in price than the ordinary raisins, and impart a much richer flavour to
the pudding.

    SULTANA GRAPE.--We have elsewhere stated that the small black
    grape grown in Corinth and the Ionian Isles is, when dried, the
    common currant of the grocers' shops; the white or yellow grape,
    grown in the same places, is somewhat larger than the black
    variety, and is that which produces the Sultana raisin. It has
    been called Sultana from its delicate qualities and unique
    growth: the finest are those of Smyrna. They have not sufficient
    flavour and sugary properties to serve alone for puddings and
    cakes, but they are peculiarly valuable for mixing, that is to
    say, for introducing in company with the richer sorts of
    Valencias or Muscatels. In white puddings, or cakes, too, where
    the whiteness must be preserved, the Sultana raisin should be
    used. But the greatest value of this fruit in the cuisine is
    that of its saving labour; for it has no stones. Half Muscatels
    and half Sultanas are an admirable mixture for general purposes.

A PLAIN CHRISTMAS PUDDING FOR CHILDREN.

1327. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1 lb. of bread crumbs, 3/4 lb. of stoned raisins, 3/4 lb.
of currants, 3/4 lb. of suet, 3 or 4 eggs, milk, 2 oz. of candied peel, 1 teaspoonful of powdered
allspice, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Let the suet be finely chopped, the raisins stoned, and the currants well washed, picked,
and dried. Mix these with the other dry ingredients, and stir all well together; beat and strain
the eggs to the pudding, stir these in, and add just sufficient milk to make it mix properly.
Tie it up in a well-floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil for at least 5 hours.
Serve with a sprig of holly placed in the middle of the pudding, and a little pounded sugar
sprinkled over it.

Time.--5 hours. Average cost, 1s. 9d.

Sufficient for 9 or 10 children. Seasonable at Christmas.

    RAISINS.--Raisins are grapes, prepared by suffering them to
    remain on the vine until they are perfectly ripe, and then
    drying them in the sun or by the heat of an oven. The sun-dried
    grapes are sweet, the oven-dried of an acid flavour. The common
    way of drying grapes for raisins is to tie two or three bunches
    of them together, whilst yet on the vine, and dip them into a
    hot lixivium of wood-ashes mixed with a little of the oil of
    olives: this disposes them to shrink and wrinkle, after which
    they are left on the vine three or four days, separated, on
    sticks in a horizontal situation, and then dried in the sun at
    leisure, after being cut from the tree.

CHRISTMAS PLUM-PUDDING.

(Very Good.)

1328. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of raisins, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1/2 lb. of mixed peel, 3/4 lb.
of bread crumbs, 3/4 lb. of suet, 8 eggs, 1 wineglassful of brandy.

Mode.--Stone and cut the raisins in halves, but do not chop them; wash, pick, and dry the currants,
and mince the suet finely; cut the candied peel into thin slices, and grate down the bread
into fine crumbs. When all these dry ingredients are prepared, mix them well together; then
moisten the mixture with the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the brandy; stir well,
that everything may be very thoroughly blended, and press the pudding into a buttered mould;
tie it down tightly with a floured cloth, and boil for 5 or 6 hours. It may be boiled in a
cloth without a mould, and will require the same time allowed for cooking. As Christmas puddings
are usually made a few days before they are required for table, when the pudding is taken out
of the pot, hang it up immediately, and put a plate or saucer underneath to catch the water
that may drain from it. The day it is to be eaten, plunge it into boiling water, and keep it
boiling for at least 2 hours; then turn it out of the mould, and serve with brandy-sauce. On
Christmas-day a sprig of holly is usually placed in the middle of the pudding, and about a
wineglassful of brandy poured round it, which, at the moment of serving, is lighted, and the
pudding thus brought to table encircled in flame.

Time.--5 or 6 hours the first time of boiling; 2 hours the day it is to be served.

Average cost, 4s.

Sufficient for a quart mould for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable on the 25th of December, and on various festive occasions till March.

Note.--Five or six of these puddings should be made at one time, as they will keep good for
many weeks, and in cases where unexpected guests arrive, will be found an acceptable, and,
as it only requires warming through, a quickly-prepared dish. Moulds of every shape and size
are manufactured for these puddings, and may be purchased of Messrs. R. & J. Slack, 336, Strand.

    BRANDY is the alcoholic or spirituous portion of wine, separated
    from the aqueous part, the colouring matter, &c., by
    distillation. The word is of German origin, and in its German
    form, brantuein, signifies burnt wine, or wine that has
    undergone the action of fire; brandies, so called, however, have
    been made from potatoes, carrots, beetroot, pears, and other
    vegetable substances; but they are all inferior to true brandy.
    Brandy is prepared in most wine countries, but that of France is
    the most esteemed. It is procured not only by distilling the
    wine itself, but also by fermenting and distilling the marc,
    or residue of the pressings of the grape. It is procured
    indifferently from red or white wine, and different wines yield
    very different proportions of it, the strongest, of course,
    giving the largest quantity. Brandy obtained from marc has a
    more acrid taste than that from wine. The celebrated brandy of
    Cognac, a town in the department of Charente, and that brought
    from Andraye, seem to owe their excellence from being made from
    white wine. Like other spirit, brandy is colourless when
    recently distilled; by mere keeping, however, owing, probably,
    to some change in the soluble matter contained in it, it
    acquires a slight colour, which is much increased by keeping in
    casks, and is made of the required intensity by the addition of
    burnt sugar or other colouring matter. What is called British
    brandy is not, in fact, brandy, which is the name, as we have
    said, of a spirit distilled from wine; but is a spirit made
    chiefly from malt spirit, with the addition of mineral acids and
    various flavouring ingredients, the exact composition being kept
    secret. It is distilled somewhat extensively in this country;
    real brandy scarcely at all. The brandies imported into England
    are chiefly from Bordeaux, Rochelle, and Cognac.

A POUND PLUM-PUDDING.

1329. Beat up the mixture well, and should the above proportion of milk not be found sufficient
to make it of the proper consistency, a little more should be added. Press the pudding into
a mould, tie it in a floured cloth, and boil for 5 hours, or rather longer, and serve with
brandy-sauce.

Time.--5 hours, or longer. Average cost, 3s.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable in winter.

Note.--The above pudding may be baked instead of boiled; it should be put into a buttered mould
or tin, and baked for about 2 hours; a smaller one would take about 1-1/4 hour.

    CITRON.--The fruit of the citron-tree (Citrus medica) is
    acidulous, antiseptic, and antiscorbutic: it excites the
    appetite, and stops vomiting, and, like lemon-juice, has been
    greatly extolled in chronic rheumatism, gout, and scurvy. Mixed
    with cordials, it is used as an antidote to the machineel
    poison. The candied peel is prepared in the same manner as
    orange or lemon-peel; that is to say, the peel is boiled in
    water until quite soft, and then suspended in concentrated syrup
    (in the cold), after which it is either dried in a current of
    warm air, or in a stove, at a heat not exceeding 120°
    Fahrenheit. The syrup must be kept fully saturated with sugar by
    reboiling it once or twice during the process. It may be dusted
    with powdered lump sugar, if necessary. The citron is supposed
    to be the Median, Assyrian, or Persian apple of the Greeks. It
    is described by Risso as having a majestic appearance, its
    shining leaves and rosy flowers being succeeded by fruit whose
    beauty and size astonish the observer, whilst their odour
    gratifies his senses. In China there is an enormous variety, but
    the citron is cultivated in all orange-growing countries.

PLUM-PUDDING OF FRESH FRUIT.

1330. Fold the edges over, and pinch them together, to prevent the juice escaping. Turn it
out of the basin, and serve quickly.

    PLUMS.--Almost all the varieties of the cultivated plum are
    agreeable and refreshing: it is not a nourishing fruit, and if
    indulged in to excess, when unripe, is almost certain to cause
    diarrhoea and cholera. Weak and delicate persons had better
    abstain from plums altogether. The modes of preparing plums are
    as numerous as the varieties of the fruit. The objections raised
    against raw plums do not apply to the cooked fruit, which even
    the invalid may eat in moderation.

PLUM TART.

1331. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of good short crust No. 1211, 1-1/2 pint of plums, 1/4 lb. of moist
sugar.

Mode.--Line the edges of a deep tart-dish with crust made by recipe No. 1211; fill the dish
with plums, and place a small cup or jar, upside down, in the midst of them. Put in the sugar,
cover the pie with crust, ornament the edges, and bake in a good oven from 1/2 to 3/4 hour.
When puff-crust is preferred to short crust, use that made by recipe No. 1206, and glaze the
top by brushing it over with the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth with a knife; sprinkle
over a little sifted sugar, and put the pie in the oven to set the glaze.

POTATO PASTY.

1332. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rump-steak or mutton cutlets, pepper and salt to taste, 1/3
pint of weak broth or gravy, 1 oz. of butter, mashed potatoes.

Mode.--Place the meat, cut in small pieces, at the bottom of the pan; season it with pepper
and salt, and add the gravy and butter broken, into small pieces. Put on the perforated plate,
with its valve-pipe screwed on, and fill up the whole space to the top of the tube with nicely-mashed
potatoes mixed with a little milk, and finish the surface of them in any ornamental manner.
If carefully baked, the potatoes will be covered with a delicate brown crust, retaining all
the savoury steam rising from the meat. Send it to table as it comes from the oven, with a
napkin folded round it.

Time.--40 to 60 minutes.

POTATO PUDDING.

1333. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of mashed potatoes, 2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs, 1/4 pint of milk,
3 tablespoonfuls of sherry, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt, the juice and rind of 1 small lemon,
2 oz. of sugar.

Mode.--Boil sufficient potatoes to make 1/2 lb. when mashed; add to these the butter, eggs,
milk, sherry, lemon-juice, and sugar; mince the lemon-peel very finely, and beat all the ingredients
well together. Put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for rather more than 1/2
hour. To enrich it, add a few pounded almonds, and increase the quantity of eggs and butter.

Time.--1/2 hour, or rather longer.

TO ICE OR GLAZE PASTRY.

1334. To glaze pastry, which is the usual method adopted for meat or raised pies, break an
egg, separate the yolk from the white, and beat the former for a short time. Then, when the
pastry is nearly baked, take it out of the oven, brush it over with this beaten yolk of egg,
and put it back in the oven to set the glaze.

1335. To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for fruit tarts and sweet dishes of
pastry, put the white of an egg on a plate, and with the blade of a knife beat it to a stiff
froth. When the pastry is nearly baked, brush it over with this, and sift over some pounded
sugar; put it back into the oven to set the glaze, and, in a few minutes, it will be done.
Great care should be taken that the paste does not catch or burn in the oven, which it is very
liable to do after the icing is laid on.

Sufficient--Allow 1 egg and 1-1/8 oz. of sugar to glaze 3 tarts.

    SUGAR has been happily called "the honey of reeds." The
    sugar-cane appears to be originally a native of the East Indies.
    The Chinese have cultivated it for 2,000 years. The Egyptians,
    Phoenicians, and Jews knew nothing about it. The Greek
    physicians are the first who speak of it. It was not till the
    year 1471 that a Venetian discovered the method of purifying
    brown sugar and making loaf sugar. He gained an immense fortune
    by this discovery. Our supplies are now obtained from Barbadoes,
    Jamaica, Mauritius, Ceylon, the East and West Indies generally,
    and the United States; but the largest supplies come from Cuba.
    Sugar is divided into the following classes:--Refined sugar,
    white clayed, brown clayed, brown raw, and molasses. The
    sugarcane grows to the height of six, twelve, or even sometimes
    twenty feet. It is propagated from cuttings, requires much
    hoeing and weeding, giving employment to thousands upon
    thousands of slaves in the slave countries, and attains maturity
    in twelve or thirteen months. When ripe, it is cut down close to
    the stole, the stems are divided into lengths of about three
    feet, which are made up into bundles, and carried to the mill,
    to be crushed between rollers. In the process of crushing, the
    juice runs down into a reservoir, from which, after a while, it
    is drawn through a siphon; that is to say, the clear fluid is
    taken from the scum. This fluid undergoes several processes of
    drying and refining; the methods varying in different
    manufactories. There are some large establishments engaged in
    sugar-refining in the neighbourhoods of Blackwall and Bethnal
    Green, London. The process is mostly in the hands of German
    workmen. Sugar is adulterated with fine sand and sawdust. Pure
    sugar is highly nutritious, adding to the fatty tissue of the
    body; but it is not easy of digestion.

BAKED RAISIN PUDDING.

(Plain and Economical.)

1336. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 3/4 lb. of stoned raisins, 1/2 lb. of suet, a pinch of
salt, 1 oz. of sugar, a little grated nutmeg, milk.

Mode.--Chop the suet finely; stone the raisins and cut them in halves; mix these with the suet,
add the salt, sugar, and grated nutmeg, and moisten the whole with sufficient milk to make
it of the consistency of thick batter. Put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for
1-1/2 hour, or rather longer. Turn it out of the dish, strew sifted sugar over, and serve.
This is a very plain recipe, and suitable where there is a family of children. It, of course,
can be much improved by the addition of candied peel, currants, and rather a larger proportion
of suet: a few eggs would also make the pudding richer.

Time.--1-1/2 hour. Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable in winter.

    INTRODUCTION OF SUGAR.--Sugar was first known as a drug, and
    used by the apothecaries, and with them was a most important
    article. At its first appearance, some said it was heating;
    others, that it injured the chest; others, that it disposed
    persons to apoplexy; the truth, however, soon conquered these
    fancies, and the use of sugar has increased every day, and there
    is no household in the civilized world which can do without it.

BOILED RAISIN PUDDING.

(Plain and Economical.)

1337. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of stoned raisins, 1/2 lb. of chopped suet, 1/2
saltspoonful of salt, milk.

Mode.--After having stoned the raisins and chopped the suet finely, mix them with the flour,
add the salt, and when these dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed, moisten the pudding with
sufficient milk to make it into rather a stiff paste. Tie it up in a floured cloth, put it
into boiling water, and boil for 4 hours: serve with sifted sugar. This pudding may, also,
be made in a long shape, the same as a rolled jam-pudding, and will then not require so long
boiling;--2-1/2 hours would then be quite sufficient.

Time.--Made round, 4 hours; in a long shape, 2-1/2 hours.

Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for 8 or 9 persons. Seasonable in winter.

BOILED RHUBARB PUDDING.

1338. Wash and wipe the rhubarb, and, if old, string it--that is to say, pare off the outside skin.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable in spring.

RHUBARB TART.

1339. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of puff-paste No. 1206, about 5 sticks of large rhubarb, 1/4 lb.
of moist sugar.

Mode.--Make a puff-crust by recipe No. 1206; line the edges of a deep pie-dish with it, and
wash, wipe, and cut the rhubarb into pieces about 1 inch long. Should it be old and tough,
string it, that is to say, pare off the outside skin. Pile the fruit high in the dish, as it
shrinks very much in the cooking; put in the sugar, cover with crust, ornament the edges, and
bake the tart in a well-heated oven from 1/2 to 3/4 hour. If wanted very nice, brush it over
with the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth, then sprinkle on it some sifted sugar, and
put it in the oven just to set the glaze: this should be done when the tart is nearly baked.
A small quantity of lemon-juice, and a little of the peel minced, are by many persons considered
an improvement to the flavour of rhubarb tart.

    RHUBARB.--This is one of the most useful of all garden
    productions that are put into pies and puddings. It was
    comparatively little known till within the last twenty or thirty
    years, but it is now cultivated in almost every British garden.
    The part used is the footstalks of the leaves, which, peeled and
    cut into small pieces, are put into tarts, either mixed with
    apples or alone. When quite young, they are much better not
    peeled. Rhubarb comes in season when apples are going out. The
    common rhubarb is a native of Asia; the scarlet variety has the
    finest flavour. Turkey rhubarb, the well-known medicinal drug,
    is the root of a very elegant plant (Rheum palmatum), coming
    to greatest perfection in Tartary. For culinary purposes, all
    kinds of rhubarb are the better for being blanched.

RAISED PIE OF POULTRY OR GAME.

1340.

Mode.--Make a stiff short crust with the above proportion of butter, flour, water, and eggs,
and work it up very smoothly; butter a raised-pie mould, as shown in No. 1190, and line it
with the paste. Previously to making the crust, bone the fowl, or whatever bird is intended
to be used, lay it, breast downwards, upon a cloth, and season the inside well with pounded
mace, allspice, pepper, and salt; then spread over it a layer of forcemeat, then a layer of
seasoned veal, and then one of ham, and then another layer of forcemeat, and roll the fowl
over, making the skin meet at the back. Line the pie with forcemeat, put in the fowl, and fill
up the cavities with slices of seasoned veal and ham and forcemeat; wet the edges of the pie,
put on the cover, pinch the edges together with the paste-pincers, and decorate it with leaves;
brush it over with beaten yolk of egg, and bake in a moderate oven for 4 hours. In the mean
time, make a good strong gravy from the bones, pour it through a funnel into the hole at the
top; cover this hole with a small leaf, and the pie, when cold, will be ready for use. Let
it be remembered that the gravy must be considerably reduced before it is poured into the pie,
as, when cold, it should form a firm jelly, and not be the least degree in a liquid state.
This recipe is suitable for all kinds of poultry or game, using one or more birds, according
to the size of the pie intended to be made; but the birds must always be boned. Truffles, mushrooms,
&c., added to this pie, make it much nicer; and, to enrich it, lard the fleshy parts of the
poultry or game with thin strips of bacon. This method of forming raised pies in a mould is
generally called a timbale, and has the advantage of being more easily made than one where
the paste is raised by the hands; the crust, besides, being eatable. (See coloured plate N
1.) Time.--Large pie, 4 hours. Average cost, 6s. 6d.

Seasonable, with poultry, all the year; with game, from September to March.

RAISED PIE OF VEAL AND HAM.

1341. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 lbs. of veal cutlets, a few slices of bacon or ham, seasoning of
pepper, salt, nutmeg, and allspice, forcemeat No. 415, 2 lbs. of hot-water paste No. 1217,
1/2 pint of good strong gravy.

Mode.--To raise the crust for a pie with the hands is a very difficult task, and can only be
accomplished by skilled and experienced cooks. The process should be seen to be satisfactorily
learnt, and plenty of practice given to the making of raised pies, as by that means only will
success be insured. Make a hot-water paste by recipe No. 1217, and from the mass raise the
pie with the hands; if this cannot be accomplished, cut out pieces for the top and bottom,
and a long piece for the sides; fasten the bottom and side-piece together by means of egg,
and pinch the edges well together; then line the pie with forcemeat made by recipe No. 415,
put in a layer of veal, and a plentiful seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice, as,
let it be remembered, these pies taste very insipid unless highly seasoned. Over the seasoning
place a layer of sliced bacon or cooked ham, and then a layer of forcemeat, veal seasoning,
and bacon, and so on until the meat rises to about an inch above the paste; taking care to
finish with a layer of forcemeat, to fill all the cavities of the pie, and to lay in the meat
firmly and compactly. Brush the top edge of the pie with beaten egg, put on the cover, press
the edges, and pinch them round with paste-pincers. Make a hole in the middle of the lid, and
ornament the pie with leaves, which should be stuck on with the white of an egg; then brush
it all over with the beaten yolk of an egg, and bake the pie in an oven with a soaking heat
from 3 to 4 hours. To ascertain when it is done, run a sharp-pointed knife or skewer through
the hole at the top into the middle of the pie, and if the meat feels tender, it is sufficiently
baked. Have ready about 1/2 pint of very strong gravy, pour it through a funnel into the hole
at the top, stop up the hole with a small leaf of baked paste, and put the pie away until wanted
for use. Should it acquire too much colour in the baking, cover it with white paper, as the
crust should not in the least degree be burnt. Mushrooms, truffles, and many other ingredients,
may be added to enrich the flavour of these pies, and the very fleshy parts of the meat may
be larded. These pies are more frequently served cold than hot, and form excellent dishes for
cold suppers or breakfasts. The cover of the pie is sometimes carefully removed, leaving the
perfect edges, and the top decorated with square pieces of very bright aspic jelly: this has
an exceedingly pretty effect.

Time.--About 4 hours. Average cost, 6s. 6d.

Sufficient for a very large pie. Seasonable from March to October.

BAKED RICE PUDDING.

I.

1342. INGREDIENTS.--1 small teacupful of rice, 4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 2 oz. of fresh butter,
2 oz. of beef marrow, 1/4 lb. of currants, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy, nutmeg, 1/4 lb. of sugar,
the rind of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Put the lemon-rind and milk into a stewpan, and let it infuse till the milk is well
flavoured with the lemon; in the mean time, boil the rice until tender in water, with a very
small quantity of salt, and, when done, let it be thoroughly drained. Beat the eggs, stir to
them the milk, which should be strained, the butter, marrow, currants, and remaining ingredients;
add the rice, and mix all well together. Line the edges of the dish with puff-paste, put in
the pudding, and bake for about 3/4 hour in a slow oven. Slices of candied-peel may be added
at pleasure, or Sultana raisins may be substituted for the currants.

    RICE, with proper management in cooking it, forms a very
    valuable and cheap addition to our farinaceous food, and, in
    years of scarcity, has been found eminently useful in lessening
    the consumption of flour. When boiled, it should be so managed
    that the grains, though soft, should be as little broken and as
    dry as possible. The water in which it is dressed should only
    simmer, and not boil hard. Very little water should be used, as
    the grains absorb a great deal, and, consequently, swell much;
    and if they take up too much at first, it is difficult to get
    rid of it. Baking it in puddings is the best mode of preparing
    it.

II.

(Plain and Economical; a nice Pudding for Children.)

1343. INGREDIENTS.--1 teacupful of rice, 2 tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, 1 quart of milk,
1/2 oz. of butter or 2 small tablespoonfuls of chopped suet, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Wash the rice, put it into a pie-dish with the sugar, pour in the milk, and stir these
ingredients well together; then add the butter cut up into very small pieces, or, instead of
this, the above proportion of finely-minced suet; grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake
the pudding, in a moderate oven, from 1-1/2 to 2 hours. As the rice is not previously cooked,
care must be taken that the pudding be very slowly baked, to give plenty of time for the rice
to swell, and for it to be very thoroughly done. Seasonable at any time.

PLAIN BOILED RICE PUDDING.

1344. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice.

Mode.--Wash the rice, tie it in a pudding-cloth, allowing room for the rice to swell, and put
it into a saucepan of cold water; boil it gently for 2 hours, and if, after a time, the cloth
seems tied too loosely, take the rice up and tighten the cloth. Serve with sweet melted butter,
or cold butter and sugar, or stewed fruit, jam, or marmalade; any of which accompaniments are
suitable for plain boiled rice.

Time.--2 hours after the water boils. Average cost, 2d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time.

BOILED RICE PUDDING.

I.

1345. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of rice, 1-1/2 pint of new milk, 2 oz. of butter, 4 eggs, 1/2 saltspoonful
of salt, 4 large tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, flavouring to taste.

Mode.--Stew the rice very gently in the above proportion of new milk, and, when it is tender,
pour it into a basin; stir in the butter, and let it stand to cool; then beat the eggs, add
these to the rice with the sugar, salt, and any flavouring that may be approved, such as nutmeg,
powdered cinnamon, grated lemon-peel, essence of bitter almonds, or vanilla.

    VARIETIES OF RICE.--Of the varieties of rice brought to our
    market, that from Bengal is chiefly of the species denominated
    cargo rice, and is of a coarse reddish-brown cast, but
    peculiarly sweet and large-grained; it does not readily separate
    from the husk, but it is preferred by the natives to all the
    others. Patua rice is more esteemed in Europe, and is of very
    superior qualify; it is small-grained, rather long and wiry, and
    is remarkably white. The Carolina rice is considered as the
    best, and is likewise the dearest in London.

II.

(With Dried or Fresh fruit; a nice dish for the Nursery.)

1346. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice, 1 pint of any kind of fresh fruit that may be preferred,
or 1/2 lb. of raisins or currants.

Mode.--Wash the rice, tie it in a cloth, allowing room for it to swell, and put it into a saucepan
of cold water; let it boil for an hour, then take it up, untie the cloth, stir in the fruit,
and tie it up again tolerably tight, and put it into the water for the remainder of the time.
Boil for another hour, or rather longer, and serve with sweet sauce, if made with dried fruit,
and with plain sifted sugar and a little cream or milk, if made with fresh fruit.

Time.--1 hour to boil the rice without the fruit; 1 hour, or longer, afterwards.

Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 children. Seasonable at any time.

Note.--This pudding is very good made with apples: they should be pared cored, and cut into
thin slices.

BOILED RICE FOR CURRIES, &c.

1347. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of rice, water, salt.

Mode.--Pick, wash, and soak the rice in plenty of cold water; then have ready a saucepan of
boiling water, drop the rice into it, and keep it boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered,
until it is tender, but not soft. Take it up, drain it, and put it on a dish before the fire
to dry: do not handle it much with a spoon, but shake it about a little with two forks, that
it may all be equally dried, and strew over a little salt. It is now ready to serve, and may
be heaped lightly on a dish by itself, or be laid round the dish as a border, with a curry
or fricassee in the centre. Some cooks smooth the rice with the back of a spoon, and then brush
it over with the yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven to colour; but the rice well boiled,
white, dry, and with every grain distinct, is by far the more preferable mode of dressing it.
During the process of boiling, the rice should be attentively watched, that it be not overdone,
as, if this is the case, it will have a mashed and soft appearance.

Time.--15 to 25 minutes, according to the quality of the rice.

Average cost, 3d.

Sufficient for a large dish of curry.

Seasonable at any time.

    RICE, in the native rough state, with the husk on, is called
    paddy, both in India and America, and it will keep better, and
    for a much longer time, in this state, than after the husk has
    been removed; besides which, prepared rice is apt to become
    dirty from rubbing about in the voyage on board ship, and in the
    warehouses. It is sometimes brought to England in the shape of
    paddy, and the husk detached here. Paddy pays less duty than
    shelled rice.

TO BOIL RICE FOR CURRIES, &c.

(Soyer's Recipe.)

1348. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of the best Carolina rice, 2 quarts of water, 1-1/2 oz. of butter,
a little salt.

Mode.--Wash the rice well in two waters; make 2 quarts of water boiling, and throw the rice
into it; boil it until three-parts done, then drain it on a sieve. Butter the bottom and sides
of a stewpan, put in the rice, place the lid on tightly, and set it by the side of the fire
until the rice is perfectly tender, occasionally shaking the pan to prevent its sticking. Prepared
thus, every grain should be separate and white. Either dish it separately, or place it round
the curry as a border.

Time.--15 to 25 minutes.

Average cost, 7d.

Sufficient for 2 moderate-sized curries.

Seasonable at any time.

BUTTERED RICE.

1349.

Mode.--Wash and pick the rice, drain and put it into a saucepan with the milk; let it swell
gradually, and, when tender, pour off the milk; stir in the butter, sugar, and nutmeg or cinnamon,
and, when the butter is thoroughly melted, and the whole is quite hot, serve. After the milk
is poured off, be particular that the rice does not burn: to prevent this, do not cease stirring
it.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice.

Average cost, 7d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

RICE was held in great esteem by the ancients: they considered it as a very beneficial food
for the chest; therefore it was recommended in cases of consumption, and to persons subject
to spitting of blood.

SAVOURY CASSEROLE OF RICE.

Or Rice Border, for Ragouts, Fricassees, &c. (an Entree).

1350. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rice, 3 pints of weak stock or broth, 2 slices of fat ham,
1 teaspoonful of salt.

Mode.--A casserole of rice, when made in a mould, is not such a difficult operation as when
it is moulded by the hand. It is an elegant and inexpensive entrée, as the remains of cold
fish, flesh, or fowl may be served as ragoûts, fricassees, &c., inclosed in the casserole.
It requires great nicety in its preparation, the principal thing to attend to being the boiling
of the rice, as, if this is not sufficiently cooked, the casserole, when moulded, will have
a rough appearance, which would entirely spoil it. After having washed the rice in two or three
waters, drain it well, and put it into a stewpan with the stock, ham, and salt; cover the pan
closely, and let the rice gradually swell over a slow fire, occasionally stirring, to prevent
its sticking. When it is quite soft, strain it, pick out the pieces of ham, and, with the back
of a large wooden spoon, mash the rice to a perfectly smooth paste. Then well grease a mould
(moulds are made purposely for rice borders), and turn it upside down for a minute or two,
to drain away the fat, should there be too much; put some rice all round the bottom and sides
of it; place a piece of soft bread in the middle, and cover it with rice; press it in equally
with the spoon, and let it cool. Then dip the mould into hot water, turn the casserole carefully
on to a dish, mark where the lid is to be formed on the top, by making an incision with the
point of a knife about an inch from the edge all round, and put it into a very hot oven. Brush
it over with a little clarified butter, and bake about 1/2 hour, or rather longer; then carefully
remove the lid, which will be formed by the incision having been made all round, and remove
the bread, in small pieces, with the point of a penknife, being careful not to injure the casserole.
Fill the centre with the ragoût or fricassee, which should be made thick; put on the cover,
glaze it, place it in the oven to set the glaze, and serve as hot as possible. The casserole
should not be emptied too much, as it is liable to crack from the weight of whatever is put
in; and in baking it, let the oven be very hot, or the casserole will probably break.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice.

Sufficient for 2 moderate-sized casseroles.

Seasonable at any time.

SWEET CASSEROLE OF RICE (an Entremets).

1351.

Mode.--This is made in precisely the same manner as a savoury casserole, only substituting
the milk and sugar for the stock and salt. Put the milk into a stewpan, with sufficient essence
of bitter almonds to flavour it well; then add the rice, which should be washed, picked, and
drained, and let it swell gradually in the milk over a slow fire. When it is tender, stir in
the sugar, butter, and yolks of eggs; butter a mould, press in the rice, and proceed in exactly
the same manner as in recipe No. 1350. When the casserole is ready, fill it with a compôte
of any fruit that may be preferred, or with melted apricot-jam, and serve.

Time.--From 3/4 to 1 hour to swell the rice, 1/2 to 3/4 hour to bake the casserole.

Average cost, exclusive of the compôte or jam, 1s. 9d.

Sufficient for 2 casseroles.

Seasonable at any time.

FRENCH RICE PUDDING, or GATEAU DE RIZ.

1352. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1/4 lb. of rice allow 1 quart of milk, the rind of 1 lemon, 1/2
teaspoonful of salt, sugar to taste, 4 oz. of butter, 6 eggs, bread crumbs.

Mode.--Put the milk into a stewpan with the lemon-rind, and let it infuse for 1/2 hour, or
until the former is well flavoured; then take out the peel; have ready the rice washed, picked,
and drained; put it into the milk, and let it gradually swell over a very slow fire. Stir in
the butter, salt, and sugar, and when properly sweetened, add the yolks of the eggs, and then
the whites, both of which should be well beaten, and added separately to the rice. Butter a
mould, strew in some fine bread crumbs, and let them be spread equally over it; then carefully
pour in the rice, and bake the pudding in a slow oven for 1 hour. Turn it out of the mould,
and garnish the dish with preserved cherries, or any bright-coloured jelly or jam. This pudding
would be exceedingly nice, flavoured with essence of vanilla.

Time.--3/4 to 1 hour for the rice to swell; to be baked 1 hour in a slow oven.

Average cost, 1s. 8d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

BAKED OR BOILED GROUND RICE PUDDING.

1353. INGREDIENTS.--2 pints of milk, 6 tablespoonfuls of ground rice, sugar to taste, 4 eggs,
flavouring of lemon-rind, nutmeg, bitter almonds or bay-leaf.

Mode.--Put 1-1/2 pint of the milk into a stewpan, with any of the above flavourings, and bring
it to the boiling-point, and, with the other 1/2 pint of milk, mix the ground rice to a smooth
batter; strain the boiling milk to this, and stir over the fire until the mixture is tolerably
thick; then pour it into a basin, leave it uncovered, and when nearly or quite cold, sweeten
it to taste, and add the eggs, which should be previously well beaten, with a little salt.
For a baked pudding, proceed in precisely the same manner, only using half the above proportion
of ground rice, with the same quantity of all the other ingredients: an hour will bake the
pudding in a moderate oven. Stewed fruit, or preserves, or marmalade, may be served with either
the boiled or baked pudding, and will be found an improvement.

Time.--1-1/2 hour to boil, 1 hour to bake.

ICED RICE PUDDING.

1354. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, 1/2 lb. of sugar, the yolks of 6 eggs,
1 small teaspoonful of essence of vanilla.

Mode.--Put the rice into a stewpan, with the milk and sugar, and let these simmer over a gentle
fire until the rice is sufficiently soft to break up into a smooth mass, and should the milk
dry away too much, a little more may be added. Stir the rice occasionally, to prevent its burning,
then beat it to a smooth mixture; add the yolks of the eggs, which should be well whisked,
and the vanilla (should this flavouring not be liked, essence of bitter almonds may be substituted
for it); put this rice custard into the freezing-pot, and proceed as directed in recipe No.
1290. When wanted for table, turn the pudding out of the mould, and pour over the top, and
round it, a compôte of oranges, or any other fruit that may be preferred, taking care that
the flavouring in the pudding harmonizes well with the fruit that is served with it.

Time.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.; exclusive of the compôte, 1s. 4d.

Seasonable.--Served all the year round.

MINIATURE RICE PUDDINGS.

1355.

Mode.--Let the rice swell in 1 pint of the milk over a slow fire, putting with it a strip of
lemon-peel; stir to it the butter and the other 1/2 pint of milk, and let the mixture cool.
Then add the well-beaten eggs, and a few drops of essence of almonds or essence of vanilla,
whichever may be preferred; butter well some small cups or moulds, line them with a few pieces
of candied peel sliced very thin, fill them three parts full, and bake for about 40 minutes;
turn them out of the cups on to a white d'oyley, and serve with sweet sauce. The flavouring
and candied peel might be omitted, and stewed fruit or preserve served instead, with these
puddings.

Time.--40 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 6 puddings. Seasonable at any time.

ARROWROOT SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.

1356. INGREDIENTS.--2 small teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, 4 dessert-spoonfuls of pounded sugar,
the juice of 1 lemon, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Mix the arrowroot smoothly with the water; put this into a stewpan; add the sugar, strained
lemon-juice, and grated nutmeg. Stir these ingredients over the fire until they boil, when
the sauce is ready for use. A small quantity of wine, or any liqueur, would very much improve
the flavour of this sauce: it is usually served with bread, rice, custard, or any dry pudding
that is not very rich.

Time.--Altogether, 15 minutes.

Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

CHERRY SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS.

(German Recipe.)

1357. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of cherries, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint
of water, 1 wineglassful of port wine, a little grated lemon-rind, 4 pounded cloves, 2 tablespoonfuls
of lemon-juice, sugar to taste.

Mode.--Stone the cherries, and pound the kernels in a mortar to a smooth paste; put the butter
and flour into a saucepan; stir them over the fire until of a pale brown; then add the cherries,
the pounded kernels, the wine, and the water. Simmer these gently for 1/4 hour, or until the
cherries are quite cooked, and rub the whole through a hair sieve; add the remaining ingredients,
let the sauce boil for another 5 minutes, and serve. This is a delicious sauce to serve with
boiled batter pudding, and when thus used, should be sent to table poured over the pudding. 1d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable in June, July, and August.

LEMON SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS.

1358. INGREDIENTS.--The rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 oz. of butter,
1 large wineglassful of sherry, 1 wineglassful of water, sugar to taste, the yolks of 4 eggs.
Crush the lumps of sugar that were rubbed on the lemon; stir these into the sauce, which should
be very sweet. When these ingredients are well mixed, and the sugar is melted, put in the beaten
yolks of 4 eggs; keep stirring the sauce until it thickens, when serve. Do not, on any account,
allow it to boil, or it will curdle, and be entirely spoiled.

Time.--Altogether, 15 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 2d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

SOYER'S SAUCE FOR PLUM-PUDDING.

1359. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of powdered sugar, 1 gill of milk,
a very little grated lemon-rind, 2 small wineglassfuls of brandy.

Mode.--Separate the yolks from the whites of 3 eggs, and put the former into a stewpan; add
the sugar, milk, and grated lemon-rind, and stir over the fire until the mixture thickens;
but do not allow it to boil. Put in the brandy; let the sauce stand by the side of the fire,
to get quite hot; keep stirring it, and serve in a boat or tureen separately, or pour it over
the pudding.

Time.--Altogether, 10 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

SWEET SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.

1360. Previously to making the melted butter, the milk can be flavoured with bitter almonds,
by infusing about half a dozen of them in it for about 1/2 hour; the milk should then be strained
before it is added to the other ingredients. This simple sauce may be served for children with
rice, batter, or bread pudding.

VANILLA CUSTARD SAUCE, to serve with Puddings.

1361. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of milk, 2 eggs, 2 oz. of sugar, 10 drops of essence of vanilla.

Mode.--Beat the eggs, sweeten the milk; stir these ingredients well together, and flavour them
with essence of vanilla, regulating the proportion of this latter ingredient by the strength
of the essence, the size of the eggs, &c. Put the mixture into a small jug, place this jug
in a saucepan of boiling water, and stir the sauce one way until it thickens; but do not allow
it to boil, or it will instantly curdle. Serve in a boat or tureen separately, with plum, bread,
or any kind of dry pudding. Essence of bitter almonds or lemon-rind may be substituted for
the vanilla, when they are more in accordance with the flavouring of the pudding with which
the sauce is intended to be served.

Time.--To be stirred in the jug from 8 to 10 minutes.

Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

AN EXCELLENT WINE SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.

1362. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 4 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz. of pounded sugar, 2
oz. of fresh butter, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt, 1/2 pint of sherry or Madeira.

Mode.--Put the butter and flour into a saucepan, and stir them over the fire until the former
thickens; then add the sugar, salt, and wine, and mix these ingredients well together. Separate
the yolks from the whites of 4 eggs; beat up the former, and stir them briskly to the sauce;
let it remain over the fire until it is on the point of simmering; but do not allow it to boil,
or it will instantly curdle. This sauce is delicious with plum, marrow, or bread puddings;
but should be served separately, and not poured over the pudding.

Time.--From 5 to 7 minutes to thicken the butter; about 5 minutes to stir the sauce over the fire.

Average cost, 1s. 10d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

WINE OR BRANDY SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.

1363. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter No. 377, 3 heaped teaspoonfuls of pounded sugar;
1 large wineglassful of port or sherry, or 3/4 of a small glassful of brandy. Serve in a boat
or tureen separately, and, if liked, pour a little of it over the pudding. To convert this
into punch sauce, add to the sherry and brandy a small wineglassful of rum and the juice and
grated rind of 1/2 lemon. Liqueurs, such as Maraschino or Curaçoa substituted for the brandy,
make excellent sauces.

Time.--Altogether, 15 minutes. Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

WINE SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.

1364. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of sherry, 1/4 pint of water, the yolks of 6 eggs, 2 oz. of pounded
sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, a few pieces of candied citron cut thin.

Mode.--Separate the yolks from the whites of 5 eggs; beat them, and put them into a very clean
saucepan (if at hand, a lined one is best); add all the other ingredients, place them over
a sharp fire, and keep stirring until the sauce begins to thicken; then take it off and serve.
If it is allowed to boil, it will be spoiled, as it will immediately curdle.

Time.--To be stirred over the fire 3 or 4 minutes; but it must not boil.

Average cost, 2s.

Sufficient for a large pudding; allow half this quantity for a moderate-sized one.

Seasonable at any time.

OPEN TART OF STRAWBERRY OR ANY OTHER KIND OF PRESERVE.

1365. INGREDIENTS.--Trimmings of puff-paste, any kind of jam.

Mode.--Butter a tart-pan of the shape shown in the engraving, roll out the paste to the thickness
of 1/2 an inch, and line the pan with it; prick a few holes at the bottom with a fork, and
bake the tart in a brisk oven from 10 to 15 minutes. Let the paste cool a little; then fill
it with preserve, place a few stars or leaves on it, which have been previously cut out of
the paste and baked, and the tart is ready for table. By making it in this manner, both the
flavour and colour of the jam are preserved, which would otherwise be lost, were it baked in
the oven on the paste; and, besides, so much jam is not required.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes. Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient.--1 tart for 3 persons. Seasonable at any time.

STRAWBERRY.--The name of this favourite fruit is said to be derived from an ancient custom
of putting straw beneath the fruit when it began to ripen, which is very useful to keep it
moist and clean. The strawberry belongs to temperate and rather cold climates; and no fruit
of these latitudes, that ripens without the aid of artificial heat, is at all comparable with
it in point of flavour. The strawberry is widely diffused, being found in most parts of the
world, particularly in Europe and America.

QUICKLY-MADE PUDDINGS.

1366. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of sifted sugar, 1/4 lb. of flour, 1 pint of
milk, 5 eggs, a little grated lemon-rind.

Mode.--Make the milk hot; stir in the butter, and let it cool before the other ingredients
are added to it; then stir in the sugar, flour, and eggs, which should be well whisked, and
omit the whites of 2; flavour with a little grated lemon-rind, and beat the mixture well. Butter
some small cups, rather more than half fill them; bake from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, according
to the size of the puddings, and serve with fruit, custard, or wine sauce, a little of which
may be poured over them. 2d.

Sufficient for 6 puddings. Seasonable at any time.

SAGO PUDDING.

1367. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls of sago, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 3
oz. of sugar, 4 eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, grated nutmeg, puff-paste.

Mode.--Put the milk and lemon-rind into a stewpan, place it by the side of the fire, and let
it remain until the milk is well flavoured with the lemon; then strain it, mix with it the
sago and sugar, and simmer gently for about 15 minutes. Let the mixture cool a little, and
stir to it the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the butter.

    SAGO.--Sago is the pith of a species of palm (Cycas
    circinalis). Its form is that of a small round grain. There are
    two sorts of sago,--the white and the yellow; but their
    properties are the same. Sago absorbs the liquid in which it is
    cooked, becomes transparent and soft, and retains its original
    shape. Its alimentary properties are the same as those of
    tapioca and arrowroot.

SAGO SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS.

1368. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of sago, 1/3 pint of water, 1/4 pint of port or sherry,
the rind and juice of 1 small lemon, sugar to taste; when the flavour is liked, a little pounded
cinnamon.

Mode.--Wash the sago in two or three waters; then put it into a saucepan, with the water and
lemon-peel; let it simmer gently by the side of the fire for 10 minutes; then take out the
lemon-peel, add the remaining ingredients, give one boil, and serve. Be particular to strain
the lemon-juice before adding it to the sauce. This, on trial, will be found a delicious accompaniment
to various boiled puddings, such as those made of bread, raisins, rice, &c.

Time.--10 minutes. Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

BAKED SEMOLINA PUDDING.

1369. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of semolina, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 12 bitter almonds,
3 oz. of butter, 4 eggs.

Mode.--Flavour the milk with the bitter almonds, by infusing them in it by the side of the
fire for about 1/2 hour; then strain it, and mix with it the semolina, sugar, and butter. Stir
these ingredients over the fire for a few minutes; then take them off, and gradually mix in
the eggs, which should be well beaten. Butter a pie-dish, line the edges with puff-paste, put
in the pudding, and bake in rather a slow oven from 40 to 50 minutes. Serve with custard sauce
or stewed fruit, a little of which may be poured over the pudding.

Time.--40 to 50 minutes.

    SEMOLINA.--After vermicelli, semolina is the most useful
    ingredient that can be used for thickening soups, meat or
    vegetable, of rich or simple quality. Semolina is softening,
    light, wholesome, easy of digestion, and adapted to the infant,
    the aged, and the invalid. That of a clear yellow colour, well
    dried and newly made, is the fittest for use.

TAPIOCA PUDDING.

1370. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of tapioca, 1 quart of milk, 2 oz. of butter, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 4
eggs, flavouring of vanilla, grated lemon-rind, or bitter almonds.

Mode.--Wash the tapioca, and let it stew gently in the milk by the side of the fire for 1/4
hour, occasionally stirring it; then let it cool a little; mix with it the butter, sugar, and
eggs, which should be well beaten, and flavour with either of the above ingredients, putting
in about 12 drops of the essence of almonds or vanilla, whichever is preferred. If the pudding
is boiled, add a little more tapioca, and boil it in a buttered basin 1-1/2 hour.

Time.--1 hour to bake, 1-1/2 hour to boil.

    TAPIOCA.--Tapioca is recommended to the convalescent, as being
    easy of digestion. It may be used in soup or broth, or mixed
    with milk or water, and butter. It is excellent food for either
    the healthy or sick, for the reason that it is so quickly
    digested without fatigue to the stomach.

TARTLETS.

1371. INGREDIENTS.--Trimmings of puff-paste, any jam or marmalade that may be preferred.

Mode.--Roll out the paste to the thickness of about 1/2 inch; butter some small round patty-pans,
line them with it, and cut off the superfluous paste close to the edge of the pan. Put a small
piece of bread into each tartlet (this is to keep them in shape), and bake in a brisk oven
for about 10 minutes, or rather longer. When they are done, and are of a nice colour, take
the pieces of bread out carefully, and replace them by a spoonful of jam or marmalade. Dish
them high on a white d'oyley, piled high in the centre, and serve.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes. Average cost, 1d. each. Sufficient.--1 lb. of paste will make 2 dishes
of tartlets. Seasonable at any time.

ROLLED TREACLE PUDDING.

1372. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of suet crust No. 1215, 1 lb. of treacle, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated
ginger. We have inserted this pudding, being economical, and a favourite one with children;
it is, of course, only suitable for a nursery, or very plain family dinner. Made with a lard
instead of a suet crust, it would be very nice baked, and would be sufficiently done in from
1-1/2 to 2 hours.

MEAT OR SAUSAGE ROLLS.

1373. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of puff-paste No. 1206, sausage-meat No. 837, the yolk of 1 egg.

Mode.--Make 1 lb. of puff-paste by recipe No. 1206; roll it out to the thickness of about 1/2
inch, or rather less, and divide it into 8, 10, or 12 squares, according to the size the rolls
are intended to be. Place some sausage-meat on one-half of each square, wet the edges of the
paste, and fold it over the meat; slightly press the edges together, and trim them neatly with
a knife. Brush the rolls over with the yolk of an egg, and bake them in a well-heated oven
for about 1/2 hour, or longer should they be very large. The remains of cold chicken and ham,
minced and seasoned, as also cold veal or beef, make very good rolls.

Time.--1/2 hour, or longer if the rolls are large.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient.--1 lb. of paste for 10 or 12 rolls.

Seasonable, with sausage-meat, from September to March or April.

SOMERSETSHIRE PUDDINGS.

1374. INGREDIENTS.--3 eggs, their weight in flour, pounded sugar and butter, flavouring of
grated lemon-rind, bitter almonds, or essence of vanilla.

Mode.--Carefully weigh the various ingredients, by placing on one side of the scales the eggs,
and on the other the flour; then the sugar, and then the butter. Warm the butter, and with
the hands beat it to a cream; gradually dredge in the flour and pounded sugar, and keep stirring
and beating the mixture without ceasing until it is perfectly smooth. Then add the eggs, which
should be well whisked, and either of the above flavourings that may be preferred; butter some
small cups, rather more than half-fill them, and bake in a brisk oven for about 1/2 hour. Turn
them out, dish them on a napkin, and serve custard or wine-sauce with them. A pretty little
supper-dish may be made of these puddings cold, by cutting out a portion of the inside with
the point of a knife, and putting into the cavity a little whipped cream or delicate preserve,
such as apricot, greengage, or very bright marmalade. The paste for these puddings requires
a great deal of mixing, as the more it is beaten, the better will the puddings be. When served
cold, they are usually called gâteaux à la Madeleine.

Time.--1/2 hour. Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 puddings. Seasonable at any time.

SUET PUDDING, to serve with Roast Meat.

1375. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of finely-chopped suet, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt,
1/2 saltspoonful of pepper, 1/2 pint of milk or water.

Mode.--Chop the suet very finely, after freeing it from skin, and mix it well with the flour;
add the salt and pepper (this latter ingredient may be omitted if the flavour is not liked),
and make the whole into a smooth paste with the above proportion of milk or water. Tie the
pudding in a floured cloth, or put it into a buttered basin, and boil from 2-1/2 to 3 hours.
To enrich it, substitute 3 beaten eggs for some of the milk or water, and increase the proportion
of suet. Most children like this accompaniment to roast meat. Where there is a large family
of children, and the means of keeping them are limited, it is a most economical plan to serve
up the pudding before the meat: as, in this case, the consumption of the latter article will
be much smaller than it otherwise would be.

SUSSEX, or HARD DUMPLINGS.

1376. Form this into small round dumplings; drop them into boiling water, and boil from 1/2
to 3/4 hour. They may be served with roast or boiled meat; in the latter case they may be cooked
with the meat, but should be dropped into the water when it is quite boiling.

Time.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.

Sufficient for 10 or 12 dumplings. Seasonable at any time.

VERMICELLI PUDDING.

1377. INGREDIENTS.--4 oz. of vermicelli, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 pint of cream, 3 oz. of butter,
3 oz. of sugar, 4 eggs.

Mode.--Boil the vermicelli in the milk until it is tender; then stir in the remaining ingredients,
omitting the cream, if not obtainable.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

VERMICELLI.--The finest vermicelli comes from Marseilles, Nimes, and Montpellier. It is a nourishing
food, and owes its name to its peculiar thread-like form. Vermicelli means, little worms.

VICARAGE PUDDING.

1378.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a basin, having previously stoned the raisins, and washed,
picked, and dried the currants; mix well with a clean knife; dip the pudding-cloth into boiling
water, wring it out, and put in the mixture. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, plunge
in the pudding, and boil for 3 hours. Turn it out on the dish, and serve with sifted sugar.

VOL-AU-VENT (an Entree).

1379. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 to 1 lb. of puff-paste No. 1208, fricasseed chickens, rabbits, ragouts,
or the remains of cold fish, flaked and warmed in thick white sauce.

Mode.--Make from 3/4 to 1 lb. of puff-paste, by recipe No. 1208, taking care that it is very
evenly rolled out each time, to insure its rising properly; and if the paste is not extremely
light, and put into a good hot oven, this cannot be accomplished, and the vol-au-vent will
look very badly. Roll out the paste to the thickness of about 1-1/2 inch, and, with a fluted
cutter, stamp it out to the desired shape, either round or oval, and, with the point of a small
knife, make a slight incision in the paste all round the top, about an inch from the edge,
which, when baked, forms the lid. Put the vol-au-vent into a good brisk oven, and keep the
door shut for a few minutes after it is put in. Particular attention should he paid to the
heating of the oven, for the paste cannot rise without a tolerable degree of heat When of a
nice colour, without being scorched, withdraw it from the oven, instantly remove the cover
where it was marked, and detach all the soft crumb from the centre: in doing this, be careful
not to break the edges of the vol-au-vent; but should they look thin in places, stop them with
small flakes of the inside paste, stuck on with the white of an egg. This precaution is necessary
to prevent the fricassee or ragoût from bursting the case, and so spoiling the appearance of
the dish. Fill the vol-au-vent with a rich mince, or fricassee, or ragoût, or the remains of
cold fish flaked and warmed in a good white sauce, and do not make them very liquid, for fear
of the gravy bursting the crust: replace the lid, and serve. To improve the appearance of the
crust, brush it over with the yolk of an egg after it has risen properly.--See coloured plate O1.

Time.--3/4 hour to bake the vol-au-vent.

Average cost, exclusive of interior, 1s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Small vol-au-vents may be made like those shown in the engraving, and filled with minced
veal, chicken, &c. They should be made of the same paste as the larger ones, and stamped out
with a small fluted cutter.

SWEET VOL-AU-VENT OF PLUMS, APPLES, OR ANY OTHER FRESH FRUIT.

1380. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of puff-paste No. 1208, about 1 pint of fruit compôte.

Mode.--Make 1/2 lb. of puff-paste by recipe No. 1208, taking care to bake it in a good brisk
oven, to draw it up nicely and make it look light. Have ready sufficient stewed fruit, the
syrup of which must be boiled down until very thick; fill the vol-au-vent with this, and pile
it high in the centre; powder a little sugar over it, and put it back in the oven to glaze,
or use a salamander for the purpose: the vol-au-vent is then ready to serve. They may be made
with any fruit that is in season, such as rhubarb, oranges, gooseberries, currants, cherries,
apples, &c.; but care must be taken not to have the syrup too thin, for fear of its breaking
through the crust.

Time.--1/2 hour to 40 minutes to bake the vol-au-vent.

Average cost, exclusive of the compôte, 1s. 1d.

Sufficient for 1 entremets.

VOL-AU-VENT OF FRESH STRAWBERRIES WITH WHIPPED CREAM.

1381.

Mode.--Make a vol-au-vent case by recipe No. 1379, only not quite so large nor so high as for
a savoury one. When nearly done, brush the paste over with the white of an egg, then sprinkle
on it some pounded sugar, and put it back in the oven to set the glaze. Remove the interior,
or soft crumb, and, at the moment of serving, fill it with the strawberries, which should be
picked, and broken up with sufficient sugar to sweeten them nicely. Place a few spoonfuls of
whipped cream on the top, and serve. 3d.

Sufficient for 1 vol-au-vent.

Seasonable in June and July.

    STRAWBERRY.--Among the Greeks, the name of the strawberry
    indicated its tenuity, this fruit forming hardly a mouthful.
    With the Latins, the name reminded one of the delicious perfume
    of this plant. Both nations were equally fond of it, and applied
    the same care to its cultivation. Virgil appears to place it in
    the same rank with flowers; and Ovid gives it a tender epithet,
    which delicate palates would not disavow. Neither does this
    luxurious poet forget the wild strawberry, which disappears
    beneath its modest foliage, but whose presence the scented air
    reveals.

WEST-INDIAN PUDDING.

1382. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of cream, 1/2 lb. of loaf-sugar, 1/2 lb. of Savoy or sponge-cakes,
8 eggs, 3 oz. of preserved green ginger. Mode.--Crumble down the cakes, put them into a basin,
and pour over them the cream, which should be previously sweetened and brought to the boiling-point;
cover the basin, well beat the eggs, and when the cream is soaked up, stir them in. 8d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

YEAST DUMPLINGS.

1383. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 quartern of dough, boiling water.

Mode.--Make a very light dough as for bread, using to mix it, milk, instead of water; divide
it into 7 or 8 dumplings; plunge them into boiling water, and boil them for 20 minutes. Serve
the instant they are taken up, as they spoil directly, by falling and becoming heavy; and in
eating them do not touch them with a knife, but tear them apart with two forks. They may be
eaten with meat gravy, or cold butter and sugar, and if not convenient to make the dough at
home, a little from the baker's answers as well, only it must be placed for a few minutes near
the fire, in a basin with a cloth over it, to let it rise again before it is made into dumplings.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

    YEAST consists principally of a substance very similar in
    composition, and in many of its sensible properties, to gluten;
    and, when new or fresh, it is inflated and rendered frothy by a
    large quantity of carbonic acid. When mixed with wort, this
    substance acts upon the saccharine matter; the temperature
    rises, carbonic acid is disengaged, and the result is ale,
    which always contains a considerable proportion of alcohol, or
    spirit. The quantity of yeast employed in brewing ale being
    small, the saccharine matter is but imperfectly decomposed:
    hence a considerable portion of it remains in the liquor, and
    gives it that viscid quality and body for which it is
    remarkable. The fermenting property of yeast is weakened by
    boiling for ten minutes, and is entirely destroyed by continuing
    the boiling. Alcohol poured upon it likewise renders it inert;
    on which account its power lessens as the alcohol is formed
    during fermentation.

YORKSHIRE PUDDING, to serve with hot Roast Beef.

1384. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 6 large tablespoonfuls of flour, 3 eggs, 1 saltspoonful
of salt.

Mode.--Put the flour into a basin with the salt, and stir gradually to this enough milk to
make it into a stiff batter. When this is perfectly smooth, and all the lumps are well rubbed
down, add the remainder of the milk and the eggs, which should be well beaten. Beat the mixture
for a few minutes, and pour it into a shallow tin, which has been previously well rubbed with
beef dripping. Put the pudding into the oven, and bake it for an hour; then, for another 1/2
hour, place it under the meat, to catch a little of the gravy that flows from it. Cut the pudding
into small square pieces, put them on a hot dish, and serve. If the meat is baked, the pudding
may at once be placed under it, resting the former on a small three-cornered stand.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

1385. CREAMS.--The yellowish-white, opaque fluid, smooth and unctuous to the touch, which separates
itself from new milk, and forms a layer on its surface, when removed by skimming, is employed
in a variety of culinary preparations. The analyses of the contents of cream have been decided
to be, in 100 parts--butter, 3.5; curd, or matter of cheese, 3.5; whey, 92.0. That cream contains
an oil, is evinced by its staining clothes in the manner of oil; and when boiled for some time,
a little oil floats upon the surface. The thick animal oil which it contains, the well-known
butter, is separated only by agitation, as in the common process of churning, and the cheesy
matter remains blended with the whey in the state of buttermilk. Of the several kinds of cream,
the principal are the Devonshire and Dutch clotted creams, the Costorphin cream, and the Scotch
sour cream. The Devonshire cream is produced by nearly boiling the milk in shallow tin vessels
over a charcoal fire, and kept in that state until the whole of the cream is thrown up. It
is used for eating with fruits and tarts. The cream from Costorphin, a village of that name
near Edinburgh, is accelerated in its separation from three or four days' old milk, by a certain
degree of heat; and the Dutch clotted cream--a coagulated mass in which a spoon will stand
upright--is manufactured from fresh-drawn milk, which is put into a pan, and stirred with a
spoon two or three times a day, to prevent the cream from separating from the milk. The Scotch
"sour cream" is a misnomer; for it is a material produced without cream. A small tub filled
with skimmed milk is put into a larger one, containing hot water, and after remaining there
all night, the thin milk (called wigg) is drawn off, and the remainder of the contents of the
smaller vessel is "sour cream."

1386. JELLIES are not the nourishing food they were at one time considered to be, and many
eminent physicians are of opinion that they are less digestible than the flesh, or muscular
part of animals; still, when acidulated with lemon-juice and flavoured with wine, they are
very suitable for some convalescents. Vegetable jelly is a distinct principle, existing in
fruits, which possesses the property of gelatinizing when boiled and cooled; but it is a principle
entirely different from the gelatine of animal bodies, although the name of jelly, common to
both, sometimes leads to an erroneous idea on that subject. Animal jelly, or gelatine, is glue,
whereas vegetable jelly is rather analogous to gum. Liebig places gelatine very low indeed
in the scale of usefulness. He says, "Gelatine, which by itself is tasteless, and when eaten,
excites nausea, possesses no nutritive value; that, even when accompanied by the savoury constituents
of flesh, it is not capable of supporting the vital process, and when added to the usual diet
as a substitute for plastic matter, does not increase, but, on the contrary, diminishes the
nutritive value of the food, which it renders insufficient in quantity and inferior in quality."
It is this substance which is most frequently employed in the manufacture of the jellies supplied
by the confectioner; but those prepared at home from calves' feet do possess some nutrition,
and are the only sort that should be given to invalids. Isinglass is the purest variety of
gelatine, and is prepared from the sounds or swimming-bladders of certain fish, chiefly the
sturgeon. From its whiteness it is mostly used for making blanc-mange and similar dishes.

1387. THE WHITE OF EGGS is perhaps the best substance that can be employed in clarifying jelly,
as well as some other fluids, for the reason that when albumen (and the white of eggs is nearly
pure albumen) is put into a liquid that is muddy, from substances suspended in it, on boiling
the liquid, the albumen coagulates in a flocculent manner, and, entangling with it the impurities,
rises with them to the surface as a scum, or sinks to the bottom, according to their weight.

1388. SOUFFLES, OMELETS, AND SWEET DISHES, in which eggs form the principal ingredient, demand,
for their successful manufacture, an experienced cook. They are the prettiest, but most difficult
of all entremets. The most essential thing to insure success is to secure the best ingredients
from an honest tradesman. The entremets coming within the above classification, are healthy,
nourishing, and pleasant to the taste, and may be eaten with safety by persons of the most
delicate stomachs.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXIX.

BAKED APPLE CUSTARD.

1389. INGREDIENTS.--1 dozen large apples, moist sugar to taste, 1 small teacupful of cold water,
the grated rind of one lemon, 1 pint of milk, 4 eggs, 2 oz. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Peel, cut, and core the apples; put them into a lined saucepan with the cold water,
and as they heat, bruise them to a pulp; sweeten with moist sugar, and add the grated lemon-rind.
When cold, put the fruit at the bottom of a pie-dish, and pour over it a custard, made with
the above proportion of milk, eggs, and sugar; grate a little nutmeg over the top, place the
dish in a moderate oven, and bake from 25 to 35 minutes. The above proportions will make rather
a large dish.

Time.--25 to 35 minutes.

Average cost, 1s. 4d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

Seasonable from July to March.

BUTTERED APPLES (Sweet Entremets).

1390. INGREDIENTS.--Apple marmalade No. 1395, 6 or 7 good boiling apples, 1/2 pint of water,
6 oz. of sugar, 2 oz. of butter, a little apricot jam.

Mode.--Pare the apples, and take out the cores without dividing them; boil up the sugar and
water for a few minutes; then lay in the apples, and simmer them very gently until tender,
taking care not to let them break. Have ready sufficient marmalade made by recipe No. 1395,
and flavoured with lemon, to cover the bottom of the dish; arrange the apples on this with
a piece of butter placed in each, and in between them a few spoonfuls of apricot jam or marmalade;
place the dish in the oven for 10 minutes, then sprinkle over the top sifted sugar; either
brown it before the fire or with a salamander, and serve hot.

Time.--From 20 to 30 minutes to stew the apples very gently, 10 minutes in the oven.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 1 entremets.

Note.--The syrup that the apples were boiled in should be saved for another occasion.

FLANC OF APPLES, or APPLES IN A RAISED CRUST.

(Sweet Entremets.)

1391. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of short crust No. 1211 or 1212, 9 moderate-sized apples, the rind
and juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 lb. of white sugar, 3/4 pint of water, a few strips of candied citron.

Mode.--Make a short crust by either of the above recipes; roll it out to the thickness of 1/2
inch, and butter an oval mould; line it with the crust, and press it carefully all round the
sides, to obtain the form of the mould, but be particular not to break the paste. Pinch the
part that just rises above the mould with the paste-pincers, and fill the case with flour;
bake it for about 3/4 hour; then take it out of the oven, remove the flour, put the case back
in the oven for another 1/4 hour, and do not allow it to get scorched. It is now ready for
the apples, which should be prepared in the following manner: peel, and take out the cores
with a small knife, or a cutter for the purpose, without dividing the apples; put them into
a small lined saucepan, just capable of holding them, with sugar, water, lemon juice and rind,
in the above proportion. Let them simmer very gently until tender; then take out the apples,
let them cool, arrange them in the flanc or case, and boil down the syrup until reduced to
a thick jelly; pour it over the apples, and garnish them with a few slices of candied citron.

1392. A MORE SIMPLE FLANC may be made by rolling out the paste, cutting the bottom of a round
or oval shape, and then a narrow strip for the sides: these should be stuck on with the white
of an egg, to the bottom piece, and the flanc then filled with raw fruit, with sufficient sugar
to sweeten it nicely. It will not require so long baking as in a mould; but the crust must
be made everywhere of an equal thickness, and so perfectly joined, that the juice does not
escape. This dish may also be served hot, and should be garnished in the same manner, or a
little melted apricot jam may be poured over the apples, which very much improves their flavour.

Time.--Altogether, 1 hour to bake the flanc from 30 to 40 minutes to stew the apples very gently.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 1 entremets or side-dish.

Seasonable from July to March.

APPLE FRITTERS.

1393. INGREDIENTS.--For the batter, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 oz. of butter, 1/2 saltspoonful of
salt, 2 eggs, milk, apples, hot lard or clarified beef-dripping.

Mode.--Break the eggs; separate the whites from the yolks, and beat them separately. Put the
flour into a basin, stir in the butter, which should be melted to a cream; add the salt, and
moisten with sufficient warm milk to make it of a proper consistency, that is to say, a batter
that will drop from the spoon. Stir this well, rub down any lumps that may be seen, and add
the whites of the eggs, which have been previously well whisked; beat up the batter for a few
minutes, and it is ready for use. Now peel and cut the apples into rather thick whole slices,
without dividing them, and stamp out the middle of each slice, where the core is, with a cutter.
Throw the slices into the batter; have ready a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; take
out the pieces of apple one by one, put them into the hot lard, and fry a nice brown, turning
them--when required. When done, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire, to absorb
the greasy moisture; then dish on a white d'oyley, piled one above the other; strew over them
some pounded sugar, and serve very hot. The flavour of the fritters would be very much improved
by soaking the pieces of apple in a little wine, mixed with sugar and lemon-juice, for 3 or
4 hours before wanted for table; the batter, also, is better for being mixed some hours before
the fritters are made.

Time.--About 10 minutes to fry them; 5 minutes to drain them.

ICED APPLES, or APPLE HEDGEHOG.

1394. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 dozen good boiling apples, 1/2 lb. of sugar, 1/2 pint of water,
the rind of 1/2 lemon minced very fine, the whites of 2 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar,
a few sweet almonds. Have ready the remainder of the apples pared, cored, and cut into thin
slices; put them into the same syrup with the lemon-peel, and boil gently until they are reduced
to a marmalade: they must be kept stirred, to prevent them from burning. Cover the bottom of
a dish with some of the marmalade, and over that a layer of the stewed apples, in the insides
of which, and between each, place some of the marmalade; then place another layer of apples,
and fill up the cavities with marmalade as before, forming the whole into a raised oval shape.
Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, mix with them the pounded sugar, and cover the
apples very smoothly all over with the icing; blanch and cut each almond into 4 or 5 strips;
place these strips at equal distances over the icing sticking up; strew over a little rough
pounded sugar, and place the dish in a very slow oven, to colour the almonds, and for the apples
to get warm through. This entremets may also be served cold, and makes a pretty supper-dish.

Time.--From 20 to 30 minutes to stew the apples.

Average cost, 1s. 9d. to 2s.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable from July to March.

THICK APPLE JELLY OR MARMALADE, for Entremets or Dessert Dishes.

1395. INGREDIENTS.--Apples; to every lb. of pulp allow 3/4 lb. of sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of
minced lemon-peel.

Mode.--Peel, core, and boil the apples with only sufficient water to prevent them from burning;
beat them to a pulp, and to every lb. of pulp allow the above proportion of sugar in lumps.
Dip the lumps into water; put these into a saucepan, and boil till the syrup is thick and can
be well skimmed; then add this syrup to the apple pulp, with the minced lemon-peel, and stir
it over a quick fire for about 20 minutes, or until the apples cease to stick to the bottom
of the pan. The jelly is then done, and may be poured into moulds which have been previously
dipped in water, when it will turn out nicely for dessert or a side-dish; for the latter a
little custard should be poured round, and it should be garnished with strips of citron or
stuck with blanched almonds.

Time.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to reduce the apples to a pulp; 20 minutes to boil after the sugar
is added.

Sufficient.--1-1/2 lb. of apples sufficient for a small mould.

Seasonable from July to March; but is best in September, October or November.

CLEAR APPLE JELLY.

1396. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen apples, 1-1/2 pint of spring-water; to every pint of juice allow
1/2 lb. of loaf sugar, 1/2 oz. of isinglass, the rind of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Pare, core, and cut the apples into quarters, and boil them, with the lemon-peel, until
tender; then strain off the apples, and run the juice through a jelly-bag; put the strained
juice, with the sugar and isinglass, which has been previously boiled in 1/2 pint of water,
into a lined saucepan or preserving-pan; boil all together for about 1/4 hour, and put the
jelly into moulds. When this jelly is nice and clear, and turned out well, it makes a pretty
addition to the supper-table, with a little custard or whipped cream round it: the addition
of a little lemon-juice improves the flavour, but it is apt to render the jelly muddy and thick.
If required to be kept any length of time, rather a larger proportion of sugar must be used.

Time.--From 1 to 1-1/2 hour to boil the apples; 1/4 hour the jelly.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for a 1-1/2-pint mould.

Seasonable from July to March.

A PRETTY DISH OF APPLES AND RICE.

1397. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, the rind of 1/2 lemon, sugar to taste,
1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 8 apples, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1/4 pint of water, 1/2 pint of boiled
custard No. 1423.

Mode.--Flavour the milk with lemon-rind, by boiling them together for a few minutes; then take
out the peel, and put in the rice, with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely, and boil gently
until the rice is quite soft; then let it cool. In the mean time pare, quarter, and core the
apples, and boil them until tender in a syrup made with sugar and water in the above proportion;
and, when soft, lift them out on a sieve to drain. Now put a middling-sized gallipot in the
centre of a dish; lay the rice all round till the top of the gallipot is reached; smooth the
rice with the back of a spoon, and stick the apples into it in rows, one row sloping to the
right and the next to the left.

APPLES A LA PORTUGAISE.

1398.

Mode.--Peel the apples, and, with a vegetable-cutter, push out the cores; boil them in the
above proportion of sugar and water, without being too much done, and take care they do not
break. Have ready a white apple marmalade, made by recipe No. 1395; cover the bottom of the
dish with this, level it, and lay the apples in a sieve to drain, pile them neatly on the marmalade,
making them high in the centre, and place a preserved cherry in the middle of each. Garnish
with strips of candied citron or apricot jam, and the dish is ready for table.

Time.--From 20 to SO minutes to stew the apples.

Average cost, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient for 1 entremets.

Seasonable from July to March.

APPLES IN RED JELLY.

(A pretty Supper Dish.)

1399. INGREDIENTS.--6 good-sized apples, 12 cloves, pounded sugar, 1 lemon, 2 teacupfuls of
water, 1 tablespoonful of gelatine, a few drops of prepared cochineal.

Mode.--Choose rather large apples; peel them and take out the cores, either with a scoop or
a small silver knife, and put into each apple 2 cloves and as much sifted sugar as they will
hold. Place them, without touching each other, in a large pie-dish; add more white sugar, the
juice of 1 lemon, and 2 teacupfuls of water. Bake in the oven, with a dish over them, until
they are done. Look at them frequently, and, as each apple is cooked, place it in a glass dish.
They must not be left in the oven after they are done, or they will break, and so would spoil
the appearance of the dish. When the apples are neatly arranged in the dish without touching
each other, strain the liquor in which they have been stewing, into a lined saucepan; add to
it the rind of the lemon, and a tablespoonful of gelatine which has been previously dissolved
in cold water, and, if not sweet, a little more sugar, and 6 cloves. Boil till quite clear;
colour with a few drops of prepared cochineal, and strain the jelly through a double muslin
into a jug; let it cool a little; then pour it into the dish round the apples. When quite cold,
garnish the tops of the apples with a bright-coloured marmalade, a jelly, or the white of an
egg, beaten to a strong froth, with a little sifted sugar.

Time.--From 30 to 50 minutes to bake the apples.

Average cost, 1s., with the garnishing.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from July to March.

APPLES AND RICE.

(A Plain Dish.)

1400. INGREDIENTS.--8 good sized apples, 3 oz. of butter, the rind of 1/2 lemon minced very
fine, 6 oz. of rice, 1-1/2 pint of milk, sugar to taste, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg,
6 tablespoonfuls of apricot jam.

Mode.--Peel the apples, halve them, and take out the cores; put them into a stewpan with the
butter, and strew sufficient sifted sugar over to sweeten them nicely, and add the minced lemon-peel.
Stew the apples very gently until tender, taking care they do not break. Boil the rice, with
the milk, sugar, and nutmeg, until soft, and, when thoroughly done, dish it, piled high in
the centre; arrange the apples on it, warm the apricot jam, pour it over the whole, and serve hot.

Time.--About 30 minutes to stew the apples very gently; about 3/4 hour to cook the rice.

APPLE SNOW.

(A pretty Supper Dish.)

1401. INGREDIENTS.--10 good-sized apples, the whites of 10 eggs, the rind of 1 lemon, 1/2 lb.
of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Peel, core, and cut the apples into quarters, and put them into a saucepan with the
lemon-peel and sufficient water to prevent them from burning,--rather less than 1/2 pint. When
they are tender, take out the peel, beat them to a pulp, let them cool, and stir them to the
whites of the eggs, which should be previously beaten to a strong froth. Add the sifted sugar,
and continue the whisking until the mixture becomes quite stiff; and either heap it on a glass
dish, or serve it in small glasses. The dish may be garnished with preserved barberries, or
strips of bright-coloured jelly; and a dish of custards should be served with it, or a jug
of cream.

Time.--From 30 to 40 minutes to stew the apples.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient to fill a moderate-sized glass dish.

Seasonable from July to March.

APPLE SOUFFLE.

1402.

Mode.--Boil the milk with the lemon-peel until the former is well flavoured; then strain it,
put in the rice, and let it gradually swell over a slow fire, adding sufficient sugar to sweeten
it nicely. Then crush the rice to a smooth pulp with the back of a wooden spoon; line the bottom
and sides of a round cake-tin with it, and put it into the oven to set; turn it out of the
tin carefully, and be careful that the border of rice is firm in every part. Mix with the marmalade
the beaten yolks of eggs and the butter, and stir these over the fire until the mixture thickens.
Take it off the fire; to this add the whites of the eggs, which should be previously beaten
to a strong froth; stir all together, and put it into the rice border. Bake in a moderate oven
for about 1/2 hour, or until the soufflé rises very light. It should be watched, and served
instantly, or it will immediately fall after it is taken from the oven.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable from July to March.

STEWED APPLES AND CUSTARD.

(A pretty Dish for a Juvenile Supper.)

1403. INGREDIENTS.--7 good-sized apples, the rind of 1/2 lemon or 4 cloves, 1/2 lb. of sugar,
3/4 pint of water, 1/2 pint of custard No. 1423.

Mode.--Pare and take out the cores of the apples, without dividing them, and, if possible,
leave the stalks on; boil the sugar and water together for 10 minutes; then put in the apples
with the lemon-rind or cloves, whichever flavour may be preferred, and simmer gently until
they are tender, taking care not to let them break. Dish them neatly on a glass dish, reduce
the syrup by boiling it quickly for a few minutes, let it cool a little; then pour it over
the apples. Have ready quite 1/2 pint of custard made by recipe No. 1423; pour it round, but
not over, the apples when they are quite cold, and the dish is ready for table. A few almonds
blanched and cut into strips, and stuck in the apples, would improve their appearance.--See
coloured plate Q1.

Sufficient to fill a large glass dish.

Seasonable from July to March.

APPLE TRIFLE.

(A Supper Dish.)

1404.

Mode.--Peel, core, and cut the apples into thin slices, and put them into a saucepan with 2
tablespoonfuls of water, the sugar, and minced lemon-rind. Boil all together until quite tender,
and pulp the apples through a sieve; if they should not be quite sweet enough, add a little
more sugar, and put them at the bottom of the dish to form a thick layer. Stir together the
milk, cream, and eggs, with a little sugar, over the fire, and let the mixture thicken, but
do not allow it to reach the boiling-point. When thick, take it off the fire; let it cool a
little, then pour it over the apples. Whip some cream with sugar, lemon-peel, &c., the same
as for other trifles; heap it high over the custard, and the dish is ready for table. It may
be garnished as fancy dictates, with strips of bright apple jelly, slices of citron, &c.

Time.--From 30 to 40 minutes to stew the apples; 10 minutes to stir the custard over the fire.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for a moderate-sized trifle.

Seasonable from July to March.

APRICOT CREAM.

1405. INGREDIENTS.--12 to 16 ripe apricots, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1-1/2 pint of milk, the yolks
of 8 eggs, 1 oz. of isinglass. Boil the milk with the other 1/4 lb. of sugar, let it cool a
little, then mix with it the yolks of eggs which have been previously well beaten; put this
mixture into a jug, place this jug in boiling water, and stir it one way over the fire until
it thickens; but on no account let it boil. Strain through a sieve, add the isinglass, previously
boiled with a small quantity of water, and keep stirring it till nearly cold; then mix the
cream with the apricots; stir well, put it into an oiled mould, and, if convenient, set it
on ice; at any rate, in a very cool place. It should turn out on the dish without any difficulty.

Time.--From 20 to 30 minutes to boil the apricots.

Average cost, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould.

Seasonable in August, September, and October.

Note.--In winter-time, when fresh apricots are not obtainable, a little jam may be substituted
for them.

FLANC OF APRICOTS, or Compote of Apricots in a Raised Crust.

(Sweet Entremets.)

1406. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of short crust No. 1212, from 9 to 12 good-sized apricots, 3/4
pint of water, 1/2 lb. of sugar.

Mode.--Make a short crust by recipe No. 1212, and line a mould with it as directed in recipe
No. 1391. Boil the sugar and water together for 10 minutes; halve the apricots, take out the
stones, and simmer them in the syrup until tender; watch them carefully, and take them up the
moment they are done, for fear they break. Arrange them neatly in the flanc or case; boil the
syrup until reduced to a jelly, pour it over the fruit, and serve either hot or cold. Greengages,
plums of all kinds, peaches, &c., may be done in the same manner, as also currants, raspberries,
gooseberries, strawberries, &c.; but with the last-named fruits, a little currant-juice added
to them will be found an improvement.

Time.--Altogether, 1 hour to bake the flanc, about 10 minutes to simmer the apricots.

ARROWROOT BLANC-MANGE.

(An inexpensive Supper Dish.)

1407. INGREDIENTS.--4 heaped tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 3 laurel-leaves
or the rind of 1/2 lemon, sugar to taste.

Mode.--Mix to a smooth batter the arrowroot with 1/2 pint of the milk; put the other pint on
the fire, with laurel-leaves or lemon-peel, whichever may be preferred, and let the milk steep
until it is well flavoured. Then strain the milk, and add it, boiling, to the mixed arrowroot;
sweeten it with sifted sugar, and let it boil, stirring it all the time, till it thickens sufficiently
to come from the saucepan. Grease a mould with pure salad-oil, pour in the blanc-mange, and
when quite set, turn it out on a dish, and pour round it a compôte of any kind of fruit, or
garnish it with jam. A tablespoonful of brandy, stirred in just before the blanc-mange is moulded,
very much improves the flavour of this sweet dish.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.

Average cost, 6d. without the garnishing.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

BLANC-MANGE.

(A Supper Dish.)

1408. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of new milk, 1-1/4 oz. of isinglass, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 1/4
lb. of loaf sugar, 10 bitter almonds, 1/2 oz. of sweet almonds, 1 pint of cream.

Mode.--Put the milk into a saucepan, with the isinglass, lemon-rind, and sugar, and let these
ingredients stand by the side of the fire until the milk is well flavoured; add the almonds,
which should be blanched and pounded in a mortar to a paste, and let the milk just boil up;
strain it through a fine sieve or muslin into a jug, add the cream, and stir the mixture occasionally
until nearly cold. Let it stand for a few minutes, then pour it into the mould, which should
be previously oiled with the purest salad-oil, or dipped in cold water. There will be a sediment
at the bottom of the jug, which must not be poured into the mould, as, when turned out, it
would very much disfigure the appearance of the blanc-mange. This blanc-mange may be made very
much richer by using 1-1/2 pint of cream, and melting the isinglass in 1/2 pint of boiling
water. The flavour may also be very much varied by adding bay-leaves, laurel-leaves, or essence
of vanilla, instead of the lemon-rind and almonds. Noyeau, Maraschino, Curaçoa, or any favourite
liqueur, added in small proportions, very much enhances the flavour of this always favourite
dish. In turning it out, just loosen the edges of the blanc-mange from the mould, place a dish
on it, and turn it quickly over; it should come out easily, and the blanc-mange have a smooth
glossy appearance when the mould is oiled, which it frequently has not when it is only dipped
in water. It may be garnished as fancy dictates.

Time.--About 1-1/2 hour to steep the lemon-rind and almonds in the milk.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 3s. 3d.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

CHEAP BLANC-MANGE.

1409.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a lined saucepan, and boil gently until the isinglass is
dissolved; taste it occasionally, to ascertain when it is sufficiently flavoured with the laurel-leaves;
then take them out, and keep stirring the mixture over the fire for about 10 minutes. Strain
it through a fine sieve into a jug, and, when nearly cold, pour it into a well-oiled mould,
omitting the sediment at the bottom. Turn it out carefully on a dish, and garnish with preserves,
bright jelly, or a compote of fruit.

Time.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

BREAD-AND-BUTTER FRITTERS.

1410. INGREDIENTS.--Batter, 8 slices of bread and butter, 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of jam.

Mode.--Make a batter, the same as for apple fritters No. 1393; cut some slices of bread and
butter, not very thick; spread half of them with any jam that may he preferred, and cover with
the other slices; slightly press them together, and cut them out in square, long, or round
pieces. Dip them in the batter, and fry in boiling lard for about 10 minutes; drain them before
the fire on a piece of blotting-paper or cloth. Dish them, sprinkle over sifted sugar, and serve.

Time.--About 10 minutes.

TO MAKE THE STOCK FOR JELLY, AND TO CLARIFY IT.

1411. INGREDIENTS.--2 calf's feet, 6 pints of water.

Mode.--The stock for jellies should always be made the day before it is required for use, as
the liquor has time to cool, and the fat can be so much more easily and effectually removed
when thoroughly set. Procure from the butcher's 2 nice calf's feet: scald them, to take off
the hair; slit them in two, remove the fat from between the claws, and wash the feet well in
warm water; put them into a stewpan, with the above proportion of cold water, bring it gradually
to boil, and remove every particle of scum as it rises. When it is well skimmed, boil it very
gently for 6 or 7 hours, or until the liquor is reduced rather more than half; then strain
it through a sieve into a basin, and put it in a cool place to set. As the liquor is strained,
measure it, to ascertain the proportion for the jelly, allowing something for the sediment
and fat at the top. To clarify it, carefully remove all the fat from the top, pour over a little
warm water, to wash away any that may remain, and wipe the jelly with a clean cloth; remove
the jelly from the sediment, put it into a saucepan, and, supposing the quantity to be a quart,
add to it 6 oz. of loaf sugar, the shells and well-whisked whites of 5 eggs, and stir these
ingredients together cold; set the saucepan on the fire, but do not stir the jelly after it
begins to warm. Let it boil about 10 minutes after it rises to a head, then throw in a teacupful
of cold water; let it boil 5 minutes longer, then take the saucepan off, cover it closely,
and let it remain 1/2 hour near the fire. Dip the jelly-bag into hot water, wring it out quite
dry, and fasten it on to a stand or the back of a chair, which must be placed near the fire,
to prevent the jelly from setting before it has run through the bag. Place a basin underneath
to receive the jelly; then pour it into the bag, and should it not be clear the first time,
run it through the bag again. This stock is the foundation of all really good jellies, which
may be varied in innumerable ways, by colouring and flavouring with liqueurs, and by moulding
it with fresh and preserved fruits. To insure the jelly being firm when turned out, 1/2 oz.
of isinglass clarified might be added to the above proportion of stock. Substitutes for calf's
feet are now frequently used in making jellies, which lessen the expense and trouble in preparing
this favourite dish; isinglass and gelatine being two of the principal materials employed;
but, although they may look as nicely as jellies made from good stock, they are never so delicate,
having very often an unpleasant flavour, somewhat resembling glue, particularly when made with
gelatine.

Time.--About 6 hours to boil the feet for the stock; to clarify it,--1/4 hour to boil, 1/2
hour to stand in the saucepan covered.

Average cost.--Calf's feet may be purchased for 6d. each when veal is in full season, but more
expensive when it is scarce.

Sufficient.--2 calf's feet should make 1 quart of stock.

Seasonable from March to October, but may be had all the year.

    HOW TO MAKE A JELLY-BAG.--The very stout flannel called
    double-mill, used for ironing-blankets, is the best material for
    a jelly-bag: those of home manufacture are the only ones to be
    relied on for thoroughly clearing the jelly. Care should be
    taken that the seam of the bag be stitched twice, to secure it
    against unequal filtration. The most convenient mode of using
    the big is to tie it upon a hoop the exact size of the outside
    of its mouth; and, to do this, strings should be sewn round it
    at equal distances. The jelly-bag may, of coarse, be made any
    size; but one of twelve or fourteen inches deep, and seven or
    eight across the mouth, will be sufficient for ordinary use. The
    form of a jelly-bag is the fool's cap.

COW-HEEL STOCK FOR JELLIES.

(More Economical than Calf's Feet.)

1412. INGREDIENTS.--2 cow-heels, 3 quarts of water.

Mode.--Procure 2 heels that have only been scalded, and not boiled; split them in two, and
remove the fat between the claws; wash them well in warm water, and put them into a saucepan
with the above proportion of cold water; bring it gradually to boil, remove all the scum as
it rises, and simmer the heels gently from 7 to 8 hours, or until the liquor is reduced one-half;
then strain it into a basin, measuring the quantity, and put it in a cool place. Clarify it
in the same manner as calf's-feet stock No. 1411, using, with the other ingredients, about
1/2 oz. of isinglass to each quart. This stock should be made the day before it is required
for use. Two dozen shank-bones of mutton, boiled for 6 or 7 hours, yield a quart of strong
firm stock. They should be put on in 2 quarts of water, which should be reduced one-half. Make
this also the day before it is required.

Time.--7 to 8 hours to boil the cow-heels, 6 to 7 hours to boil the shank-bones.

Average cost, from 4d. to 6d. each.

Sufficient.--2 cow-heels should make 3 pints of stock.

Seasonable at any time.

ISINGLASS OR GELATINE JELLY.

(Substitutes for Calf's Feet.)

1413. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of isinglass or gelatine, 2 quarts of water.

Mode.--Put the isinglass or gelatine into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water;
bring it quickly to boil, and let it boil very fast, until the liquor is reduced one-half.
Carefully remove the scum as it rises, then strain it through a jelly-bag, and it will be ready
for use. If not required very clear, it may be merely strained through a fine sieve, instead
of being run through a bag. Rather more than 1/2 oz. of isinglass is about the proper quantity
to use for a quart of strong calf's-feet stock, and rather more than 2 oz. for the same quantity
of fruit juice. As isinglass varies so much in quality and strength, it is difficult to give
the exact proportions. The larger the mould, the stiffer should be the jelly; and where there
is no ice, more isinglass must be used than if the mixture were frozen. This forms a stock
for all kinds of jellies, which may be flavoured in many ways.

Time.--1-1/2 hour.

Sufficient, with wine, syrup, fruit, &c., to fill two moderate-sized moulds.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--The above, when boiled, should be perfectly clear, and may be mixed warm with wine,
flavourings, fruits, &c., and then run through the bag.

    ISINGLASS.--The best isinglass is brought from Russia; some of
    an inferior kind is brought from North and South America and the
    East Indies: the several varieties may be had from the wholesale
    dealers in isinglass in London. In choosing isinglass for
    domestic use, select that which is whitest, has no unpleasant
    odour, and which dissolves most readily in water. The inferior
    kinds are used for fining beer, and similar purposes. Isinglass
    is much adulterated: to test its purity, take a few threads of
    the substance, drop some into boiling water, some into cold
    water, and some into vinegar. In the boiling water the isinglass
    will dissolve, in cold water it will become white and "cloudy,"
    and in vinegar it will swell and become jelly-like. If the
    isinglass is adulterated with gelatine (that is to say, the
    commoner sorts of gelatine,--for isinglass is classed amongst
    gelatines, of all which varieties it is the very purest and
    best), in boiling water the gelatine will not so completely
    dissolve as the isinglass; in cold water it becomes clear and
    jelly-like; and in vinegar it will harden.

HOW TO MOULD BOTTLED JELLIES.

1414. Uncork the bottle; place it in a saucepan of hot water until the jelly is reduced to
a liquid state; taste it, to ascertain whether it is sufficiently flavoured, and if not, add
a little wine. Pour the jelly into moulds which have been soaked in water; let it set, and
turn it out by placing the mould in hot water for a minute; then wipe the outside, put a dish
on the top, and turn it over quickly. The jelly should then slip easily away from the mould,
and be quite firm. It may be garnished as taste dictates.

TO CLARIFY SYRUP FOR JELLIES.

1415. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of water allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar; the white of 1 egg.

Mode.--Put the sugar and water into a stewpan; set it on the fire, and, when the sugar is dissolved,
add the white of the egg, whipped up with a little water. Whisk the whole well together, and
simmer very gently until it has thrown up all the scum. Take this off as it rises, strain the
syrup through a fine sieve or cloth into a basin, and keep it for use.

CALF'S-FEET JELLY.

1416. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of calf's-feet stock No. 1411, 1/2 lb. of sugar, 1/2 pint of sherry,
1 glass of brandy, the shells and whites of 5 eggs, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 1/2 oz.
of isinglass.

Mode.--Prepare the stock as directed in recipe No. 1411, taking care to leave the sediment,
and to remove all the fat from the surface. Put it into a saucepan, cold, without clarifying
it; add the remaining ingredients, and stir them well together before the saucepan is placed
on the fire. Then simmer the mixture gently for 1/4 hour, but do not stir it after it begins
to warm. Throw in a teacupful of cold water, boil for another 5 minutes, and keep the saucepan
covered by the side of the fire for about 1/2 hour, but do not let it boil again. In simmering,
the head or scum may be carefully removed as it rises; but particular attention must be given
to the jelly, that it be not stirred in the slightest degree after it is heated. The isinglass
should be added when the jelly begins to boil: this assists to clear it, and makes it firmer
for turning out. Wring out a jelly-bag in hot water; fasten it on to a stand, or the back of
a chair; place it near the fire with a basin underneath it, and run the jelly through it. Should
it not be perfectly clear the first time, repeat the process until the desired brilliancy is
obtained. Soak the moulds in water, drain them for half a second, pour in the jelly, and put
it in a cool place to set. If ice is at hand, surround the moulds with it, and the jelly will
set sooner, and be firmer when turned out. In summer it is necessary to have ice in which to
put the moulds, or the cook will be, very likely, disappointed, by her jellies being in too
liquid a state to turn out properly, unless a great deal of isinglass is used. When wanted
for table, dip the moulds in hot water for a minute, wipe the outside with a cloth, lay a dish
on the top of the mould, turn it quickly over, and the jelly should slip out easily. It is
sometimes served broken into square lumps, and piled high in glasses. Earthenware moulds are
preferable to those of pewter or tin, for red jellies, the colour and transparency of the composition
being often spoiled by using the latter.

To make this jelly more economically, raisin wine may be substituted for the sherry and brandy,
and the stock made from cow-heels, instead of calf's feet.

Time.--20 minutes to simmer the jelly, 1/2 hour to stand covered.

Average cost, reckoning the feet at 6d. each, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient to fill two 1-1/2-pint moulds. Seasonable at any time.

Note.--As lemon-juice, unless carefully strained, is liable to make the jelly muddy, see that
it is clear before it is added to the other ingredients. Omit the brandy when the flavour is
objected to.

SHERRY.--There are several kinds of sherry, as pale and brown, and there are various degrees
of each. Sherry is, in general, of an amber-colour, and, when good, has a fine aromatic odour,
with something of the agreeable bitterness of the peach kernel. When new, it is harsh and fiery,
and requires to be mellowed in the wood for four or five years. Sherry has of late got much
into fashion in England, from the idea that it is more free from acid than other wines; but
some careful experiments on wines do not fully confirm this opinion.

CANNELONS, or FRIED PUFFS.

(Sweet Entremets.)

1417. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of puff-paste No. 1205; apricot, or any kind of preserve that may
be preferred; hot lard.

Mode.--Cannelons which are made of puff-paste rolled very thin, with jam inclosed, and cut
out in long narrow rolls or puffs, make a very pretty and elegant dish. Make some good puff-paste,
by recipe No. 1205; roll it out very thin, and cut it into pieces of an equal size, about 2
inches wide and 8 inches long; place upon each piece a spoonful of jam, wet the edges with
the white of egg, and fold the paste over twice; slightly press the edges together, that the
jam may not escape in the frying; and when all are prepared, fry them in boiling lard until
of a nice brown, letting them remain by the side of the fire after they are coloured, that
the paste may be thoroughly done. Drain them before the fire, dish on a d'oyley, sprinkle over
them sifted sugar, and serve. These cannelons are very delicious made with fresh instead of
preserved fruit, such as strawberries, raspberries, or currants: it should be laid in the paste,
plenty of pounded sugar sprinkled over, and folded and fried in the same manner as stated above.

Time.--About 10 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient,--1/2 lb. of paste for a moderate-sized dish of cannelons.

Seasonable, with jam, at any time.

CHARLOTTE-AUX-POMMES.

1418. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of rather stale bread 1/2 inch thick, clarified butter, apple
marmalade made by recipe No. 1395, with about 2 dozen apples, 1/2 glass of sherry.

Mode.--Cut a slice of bread the same shape as the bottom of a plain round mould, which has
been well buttered, and a few strips the height of the mould, and about 1-1/2 inch wide; dip
the bread in clarified butter (or spread it with cold butter, if not wanted quite so rich);
place the round piece at the bottom of the mould, and set the narrow strips up the sides of
it, overlapping each other a little, that no juice from the apples may escape, and that they
may hold firmly to the mould. Brush the interior over with white of egg (this will assist to
make the case firmer); fill it with apple marmalade made by recipe No. 1395, with the addition
of a little sherry, and cover them with a round piece of bread, also brushed over with egg,
the same as the bottom; slightly press the bread down, to make it adhere to the other pieces;
put a plate on the top, and bake the charlotte in a brisk oven, of a light colour. Turn it
out on the dish, strew sifted sugar over the top, and pour round it a little melted apricot jam.

Time.--40 to 50 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 9d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from July to March.

AN EASY METHOD OF MAKING A CHARLOTTE-AUX-POMMES.

1419.

Mode.--Make a cake with the flour, butter, sugar, and baking-powder; moisten with the egg and
sufficient milk to make it the proper consistency, and bake it in a round tin. When cold, scoop
out the middle, leaving a good thickness all round the sides, to prevent them breaking; take
some of the scooped-out pieces, which should be trimmed into neat slices; lay them in the cake,
and pour over sufficient raisin-wine, with the addition of a little brandy, if approved, to
soak them well. Have ready some apple marmalade, made by recipe No. 1395; place a layer of
this over the soaked cake, then a layer of cake and a layer of apples; whip the cream to a
froth, mixing with it the sugar and lemon-juice; pile it on the top of the charlotte, and garnish
it with pieces of clear apple jelly. This dish is served cold, but may be eaten hot, by omitting
the cream, and merely garnishing the top with bright jelly just before it is sent to table.

Time.--1 hour to bake the cake.

A VERY SIMPLE APPLE CHARLOTTE.

1420. INGREDIENTS.--9 slices of bread and butter, about 6 good-sized apples, 1 tablespoonful
of minced lemon-peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of juice, moist sugar to taste.

Mode.--Butter a pie-dish; place a layer of bread and butter, without the crust, at the bottom;
then a layer of apples, pared, cored, and cut into thin slices; sprinkle over these a portion
of the lemon-peel and juice, and sweeten with moist sugar. Place another layer of bread and
butter, and then one of apples, proceeding in this manner until the dish is full; then cover
it up with the peel of the apples, to preserve the top from browning or burning; bake in a
brisk oven for rather more than 3/4 hour; torn the charlotte on a dish, sprinkle sifted sugar
over, and serve.

CHARLOTTE RUSSE.

(An Elegant Sweet Entremets.)

1421. INGREDIENTS.--About 18 Savoy biscuits, 3/4 pint of cream, flavouring of vanilla, liqueurs,
or wine, 1 tablespoonful of pounded sugar, 1/2 oz. of isinglass.

Mode.--Procure about 18 Savoy biscuits, or ladies'-fingers, as they are sometimes called; brush
the edges of them with the white of an egg, and line the bottom of a plain round mould, placing
them like a star or rosette. Stand them upright all round the edge; carefully put them so closely
together that the white of the egg connects them firmly, and place this case in the oven for
about 5 minutes, just to dry the egg. Whisk the cream to a stiff froth, with the sugar, flavouring,
and melted isinglass; fill the charlotte with it, cover with a slice of sponge-cake cut in
the shape of the mould; place it in ice, where let it remain till ready for table; then turn
it on a dish, remove the mould, and serve. 1 tablespoonful of liqueur of any kind, or 4 tablespoonfuls
of wine, would nicely flavour the above proportion of cream. For arranging the biscuits in
the mould, cut them to the shape required, so that they fit in nicely, and level them with
the mould at the top, that, when turned out, there may be something firm to rest upon. Great
care and attention is required in the turning out of this dish, that the cream does not burst
the case; and the edges of the biscuits must have the smallest quantity of egg brushed over
them, or it would stick to the mould, and so prevent the charlotte from coming away properly.

Time.--5 minutes in the oven.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 2s.

Sufficient for 1 charlotte. Seasonable at any time.

CREAM A LA VALOIS.

1422. INGREDIENTS.--4 sponge-cakes, jam, 3/4 pint of cream, sugar to taste, the juice of 1/2
lemon, 1/4 glass of sherry, 1-1/4 oz. of isinglass.

Mode.--Cut the sponge-cakes into thin slices; place two together, with preserve between them,
and pour over them a small quantity of sherry mixed with a little brandy. Sweeten and flavour
the cream with the lemon-juice and sherry; add the isinglass, which should be dissolved in
a little water, and beat up the cream well. Place a little in an oiled mould; arrange the pieces
of cake in the cream; then fill the mould with the remainder; let it cool, and turn it out
on a dish. By oiling the mould, the cream will have a much smoother appearance, and will turn
out more easily than when merely dipped in cold water. Seasonable at any time.

BOILED CUSTARDS.

1423. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, 3 oz. of loaf sugar, 3 laurel-leaves, or the rind
of 4 lemon, or a few drops of essence of vanilla, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.

Mode.--Put the milk into a lined saucepan, with the sugar, and whichever of the above flavourings
may be preferred (the lemon-rind flavours custards most deliciously), and let the milk steep
by the side of the fire until it is well flavoured. Bring it to the point of boiling, then
strain it into a basin; whisk the eggs well, and, when the milk has cooled a little, stir in
the eggs, and strain this mixture into a jug. Place this jug in a saucepan of boiling water
over the fire; keep stirring the custard one way until it thickens; but on no account allow
it to reach the boiling-point, as it will instantly curdle and be full of lumps. Take it off
the fire, stir in the brandy, and, when this is well mixed with the custard, pour it into glasses,
which should be rather more than three-parts full; grate a little nutmeg over the top, and
the dish is ready for table. To make custards look and eat better, ducks' eggs should be used,
when obtainable; they add very much to the flavour and richness, and so many are not required
as of the ordinary eggs, 4 ducks' eggs to the pint of milk making a delicious custard. When
desired extremely rich and good, cream should be substituted for the milk, and double the quantity
of eggs used, to those mentioned, omitting the whites.

Time. 1/2 hour to infuse the lemon-rind, about 10 minutes to stir the custard. Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient to fill 8 custard-glasses. Seasonable at any time.

GINGER APPLES.

(A pretty Supper or Dessert Dish.)

1424. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of whole ginger, 1/4 pint of whiskey, 3 lbs. of apples, 2 lbs.
of white sugar, the juice of 2 lemons.

Mode.--Bruise the ginger, put it into a small jar, pour over sufficient whiskey to cover it,
and let it remain for 3 days; then cut the apples into thin slices, after paring and coring
them; add the sugar and the lemon-juice, which should he strained; and simmer all together
very gently until the apples are transparent, but not broken. Serve cold, and garnish the dish
with slices of candied lemon-peel or preserved ginger.

Time.--3 days to soak the ginger; about 3/4 hour to simmer the apples very gently.

Average cost, 2s, 6d.

Sufficient for 3 dishes. Seasonable from July to March.

FRENCH PANCAKES.

1425. INGREDIENTS.--2 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, 2 oz. of flour, 1/2 pint
of new milk.

Mode.--Beat the eggs thoroughly, and put them into a basin with the butter, which should be
beaten to a cream; stir in the sugar and flour, and when these ingredients are well mixed,
add the milk; keep stirring and beating the mixture for a few minutes; put it on buttered plates,
and bake in a quick oven for 20 minutes. Serve with a cut lemon and sifted sugar, or pile the
pancakes high on a dish, with a layer of preserve or marmalade between each.

Time.--20 minutes. Average cost, 7d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

DUTCH FLUMMERY.

1426. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of isinglass, the rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1 pint of water,
4 eggs, 1 pint of sherry, Madeira, or raisin-wine; sifted sugar to taste.

Mode.--Put the water, isinglass, and lemon-rind into a lined saucepan, and simmer gently until
the isinglass is dissolved; strain this into a basin, stir in the eggs, which should be well
beaten, the lemon-juice, which should be strained, and the wine; sweeten to taste with pounded
sugar, mix all well together, pour it into a jug, set this jug in a saucepan of boiling water
over the fire, and keep stirring it one way until it thickens; but take care that it does not
boil. Strain it into a mould that has been oiled or laid in water for a short time, and put
it in a cool place to set. A tablespoonful of brandy stirred in just before it is poured into
the mould, improves the flavour of this dish: it is better if made the day before it is required
for table.

Time.--1/4 hour to simmer the isinglass; about 1/4 hour to stir the mixture over the fire.

Average cost, 4s. 6d., if made with sherry; less with raisin-wine.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

    PALE SHERRIES are made from the same grapes as brown. The latter
    are coloured by an addition of some cheap must, or wine which
    has been boiled till it has acquired a deep-brown tint. Pale
    sherries were, some time ago, preferred in England, being
    supposed most pure; but the brown are preferred by many people.
    The inferior sherries exported to England are often mixed with a
    cheap and light wine called Moguer, and are strengthened in the
    making by brandy; but too frequently they are adulterated by the
    London dealers.

CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE.

1427. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 3 teaspoonfuls of pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 3 oz.
of the best chocolate.

Mode.--Break the eggs, separating the whites from the yolks, and put them into different basins;
add to the yolks the sugar, flour, and chocolate, which should be very finely grated, and stir
these ingredients for 5 minutes. Then well whisk the whites of the eggs in the other basin,
until they are stiff, and, when firm, mix lightly with the yolks, till the whole forms a smooth
and light substance; butter a round cake-tin, put in the mixture, and bake in a moderate oven
from 15 to 20 minutes. Pin a white napkin round the tin, strew sifted sugar over the top of
the soufflé, and send it immediately to table. The proper appearance of this dish depends entirely
on the expedition with which it is served, and some cooks, to preserve its lightness, hold
a salamander over the soufflé until it is placed on the table. If allowed to stand after it
comes from the oven, it will be entirely spoiled, as it falls almost immediately. Seasonable
at any time.

DARIOLES A LA VANILLE.

(Sweet Entremets.)

1428.

Mode.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter, with the milk; stir in the cream, sugar, the eggs,
which should be well whisked, and the butter, which should be beaten to a cream. Put in some
essence of vanilla, drop by drop, until the mixture is well flavoured; line some dariole-moulds
with puff-paste, three-parts fill them with the batter, and bake in a good oven from 25 to
35 minutes. Turn them out of the moulds on a dish, without breaking them; strew over sifted
sugar, and serve. The flavouring of the darioles may be varied by substituting lemon, cinnamon,
or almonds, for the vanilla.

Time.--25 to 35 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 8d.

Sufficient to fill 6 or 7 dariole-moulds. Seasonable at any time.

CURRANT FRITTERS.

1429. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 4 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of
boiled rice, 3 tablespoonfuls of currants, sugar to taste, a very little grated nutmeg, hot
lard or clarified dripping.

Mode.--Put the milk into a basin with the flour, which should previously be rubbed to a smooth
batter with a little cold milk; stir these ingredients together; add the well-whisked eggs,
the rice, currants, sugar, and nutmeg. Beat the mixture for a few minutes, and, if not sufficiently
thick, add a little more boiled rice; drop it, in small quantities, into a pan of boiling lard
or clarified dripping; fry the fritters a nice brown, and, when done, drain them on a piece
of blotting-paper, before the fire. Pile them on a white d'oyley, strew over sifted sugar,
and serve them very hot. Send a cut lemon to table with them.

Time.--From 8 to 10 minutes to fry the fritters.

Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

CHOCOLATE CREAM.

1430.

Mode.--Beat the yolks of the eggs well; put them into a basin with the grated chocolate, the
sugar, and 1 pint of the cream; stir these ingredients well together, pour them into a jug,
and set this jug in a saucepan of boiling water; stir it one way until the mixture thickens,
but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Strain the cream through a sieve into a basin;
stir in the isinglass and the other 1/2 pint of cream, which should be well whipped; mix all
well together, and pour it into a mould which has been previously oiled with the purest salad-oil,
and, if at hand, set it in ice until wanted for table.

Time.--About 10 minutes to stir the mixture over the fire.

Average cost, 4s. 6d, with cream at 1s. per pint.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

GENEVA WAFERS.

1431. INGREDIENTS.--2 eggs, 3 oz. of butter, 3 oz. of flour, 3 oz. of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Well whisk the eggs; put them into a basin, and stir to them the butter, which should
be beaten to a cream; add the flour and sifted sugar gradually, and then mix all well together.
Butter a baking-sheet, and drop on it a teaspoonful of the mixture at a time, leaving a space
between each. Bake in a cool oven; watch the pieces of paste, and, when half done, roll them
up like wafers, and put in a small wedge of bread or piece of wood, to keep them in shape.
Return them to the oven until crisp. Before serving, remove the bread, put a spoonful of preserve
in the widest end, and fill up with whipped cream. This is a very pretty and ornamental dish
for the supper-table, and is very nice and very easily made.

Time.--Altogether 20 to 25 minutes.

Average cost, exclusive of the preserve and cream, 7d.

Sufficient for a nice-sized dish. Seasonable at any time.

GINGER CREAM.

1432. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 4 eggs, 1 pint of cream, 3 oz. of preserved ginger, 2 dessertspoonfuls
of syrup, sifted sugar to taste, 1 oz. of isinglass.

Mode.--Slice the ginger finely; put it into a basin with the syrup, the well-beaten yolks of
eggs, and the cream; mix these ingredients well together, and stir them over the fire for about
10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens; then take it off the fire, whisk till nearly cold,
sweeten to taste, add the isinglass, which should be melted and strained, and serve the cream
in a glass dish. It may be garnished with slices of preserved ginger or candied citron.

Time.--About 10 minutes to stir the cream over the fire.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient for a good-sized dish. Seasonable at any time.

    PRESERVED GINGER comes to us from the West Indies. It is made by
    scalding the roots when they are green and full of sap, then
    peeling them in cold water, and putting them into jars, with a
    rich syrup; in which state we receive them. It should be chosen
    of a bright-yellow colour, with a little transparency: what is
    dark-coloured, fibrous, and stringy, is not good. Ginger roots,
    fit for preserving, and in size equal to West Indian, have been
    produced in the Royal Agricultural Garden in Edinburgh.

TO MAKE GOOSEBERRY FOOL.

1433. INGREDIENTS.--Green gooseberries; to every pint of pulp add 1 pint of milk, or 1/2 pint
of cream and 1/2 pint of milk; sugar to taste.

Mode.--Cut the tops and tails off the gooseberries; put them into a jar, with 2 tablespoonfuls
of water and a little good moist sugar; set this jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and let
it boil until the fruit is soft enough to mash. When done enough, beat it to a pulp, work this
pulp through a colander, and stir to every pint the above proportion of milk, or equal quantities
of milk and cream. Ascertain if the mixture is sweet enough, and put in plenty of sugar, or
it will not be eatable; and in mixing the milk and gooseberries, add the former very gradually
to these: serve in a glass dish, or in small glasses. This, although a very old-fashioned and
homely dish, is, when well made, very delicious, and, if properly sweetened, a very suitable
preparation for children.

Time.--From 3/4 to 1 hour. Average cost, 6d. per pint, with milk.

Sufficient.--A pint of milk and a pint of gooseberry pulp for 5 or 6 children.

Seasonable in May and June.

GOOSEBERRY TRIFLE.

1434. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of gooseberries, sugar to taste, 1 pint of custard No. 1423, a
plateful of whipped cream.

Mode.--Put the gooseberries into a jar, with sufficient moist sugar to sweeten them, and boil
them until reduced to a pulp. Put this pulp at the bottom of a trifle-dish; pour over it a
pint of custard made by recipe No. 1423, and, when cold, cover with whipped cream. The cream
should be whipped the day before it is wanted for table, as it will then be so much firmer
and more solid. The dish may be garnished as fancy dictates.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to boil the gooseberries.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 1 trifle. Seasonable in May and June.

INDIAN FRITTERS.

1435. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of flour, boiling water, the yolks of 4 eggs, the whites
of 2, hot lard or clarified dripping, jam.

Mode.--Put the flour into a basin, and pour over it sufficient boiling water to make it into
a stiff paste, taking care to stir and beat it well, to prevent it getting lumpy. Leave it
a little time to cool, and then break into it (without beating them at first) the yolks of
4 eggs and the whites of 2, and stir and beat all well together. Have ready some boiling lard
or butter; drop a dessertspoonful of batter in at a time, and fry the fritters of a light brown.
They should rise so much as to be almost like balls. Serve on a dish, with a spoonful of preserve
or marmalade dropped in between each fritter. This is an excellent dish for a hasty addition
to dinner, if a guest unexpectedly arrives, it being so easily and quickly made, and it is
always a great favourite.

Time.--From 5 to 8 minutes to fry the fritters.

Average cost, exclusive of the jam, 5d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time.

INDIAN TRIFLE.

1436. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of milk, the rind of 1/2 large lemon, sugar to taste, 5 heaped
tablespoonfuls of rice-flour, 1 oz. of sweet almonds, 1/2 pint of custard.

Mode.--Boil the milk and lemon-rind together until the former is well flavoured; take out the
lemon-rind and stir in the rice-flour, which should first be moistened with cold milk, and
add sufficient loaf sugar to sweeten it nicely. Boil gently for about 5 minutes, and keep the
mixture stirred; take it off the fire, let it cool a little, and pour it into a glass dish.
When cold, cut the rice out in the form of a star, or any other shape that may be preferred;
take out the spare rice, and fill the space with boiled custard. Blanch and cut the almonds
into strips; stick them over the trifle, and garnish it with pieces of brightly-coloured jelly,
or preserved fruits, or candied citron.

Time.--1/4 hour to simmer the milk, 5 minutes after the rice is added.

Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 1 trifle.

Seasonable at any time.

    THE CITRON.--The citron belongs to the same species as the
    lemon, being considered only as a variety, the distinction
    between them not being very great. It is larger, and is less
    succulent, but more acid: with a little artificial heat, the
    citron comes to as great perfection in England as in Spain and
    Italy. The fruit is oblong and about five or six inches in
    length. The tree is thorny. The juice forms an excellent
    lemonade with sugar and water; its uses in punch, negus, and in
    medicine, are well known. The rind is very thick, and, when
    candied with sugar, forms an excellent sweetmeat. There are
    several varieties cultivated in England, one of which is termed
    the Forbidden Fruit.

ITALIAN CREAM.

1437. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 4 pint of cream, sugar to taste, 1 oz. of isinglass, 1
lemon, the yolks of 4 eggs.

Mode.--Put the cream and milk into a saucepan, with sugar to sweeten, and the lemon-rind. Boil
until the milk is well flavoured then strain it into a basin, and add the beaten yolks of eggs.
Take the cream off the fire, stir in the lemon-juice and isinglass, which should be melted,
and whip well; fill a mould, place it in ice if at hand, and, when set, turn it out on a dish,
and garnish as taste may dictate. The mixture may be whipped and drained, and then put into
small glasses, when this mode of serving is preferred.

Time.--From 5 to 8 minutes to stir the mixture in the jug.

Average cost, with the best isinglass, 2s.

THE HIDDEN MOUNTAIN.

(A pretty Supper Dish.)

1438. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, a few slices of citron, sugar to taste, 1/4 pint of cream, a layer
of any kind of jam.

Mode.--Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately; then mix them and beat well again,
adding a few thin slices of citron, the cream, and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten it nicely.
When the mixture is well beaten, put it into a buttered pan, and fry the same as a pancake;
but it should be three times the thickness of an ordinary pancake. Cover it with jam, and garnish
with slices of citron and holly-leaves. This dish is served cold.

Time.--About 10 minutes to fry the mixture.

Average cost, with the jam, 1s. 4d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

JAUNEMANGE.

1439. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of isinglass, 1 pint of water, 1/2 pint of white wine, the rind and
juice of 1 large lemon, sugar to taste, the yolks of 6 eggs.

Mode.--Put the isinglass, water, and lemon-rind into a saucepan, and boil gently until the
former is dissolved; then add the strained lemon-juice, the wine, and sufficient white sugar
to sweeten the whole nicely. Boil for 2 or 3 minutes, strain the mixture into a jug, and add
the yolks of the eggs, which should be well beaten; place the jug in a saucepan of boiling
water; keep stirring the mixture one way until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil; then
take it off the fire, and keep stirring until nearly cold. Pour it into a mould, omitting the
sediment at the bottom of the jug, and let it remain until quite firm. 9d.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

JELLY MOULDED WITH FRESH FRUIT, or MACEDOINE DE FRUITS.

1440. INGREDIENTS.--Rather more than 1-1/2 pint of jelly, a few nice strawberries, or red or
white currants, or raspberries, or any fresh fruit that may be in season.

Mode.--Have ready the above proportion of jelly, which must be very clear and rather sweet,
the raw fruit requiring an additional quantity of sugar. Select ripe, nice-looking fruit; pick
off the stalks, unless currants are used, when they are laid in the jelly as they come from
the tree. Begin by putting a little jelly at the bottom of the mould, which must harden; then
arrange the fruit round the sides of the mould, recollecting; that it will be reversed when
turned out; then pour in some more jelly to make the fruit adhere, and, when that layer is
set, put another row of fruit and jelly until the mould is full. If convenient, put it in ice
until required for table, then wring a cloth in boiling water, wrap it round the mould for
a minute, and turn the jelly carefully out. Peaches, apricots, plums, apples, &c., are better
for being boiled in a little clear syrup before they are laid in the jelly; strawberries, raspberries,
grapes, cherries, and currants are put in raw. In winter, when fresh fruits are not obtainable,
a very pretty jelly may be made with preserved fruits or brandy cherries: these, in a bright
and clear jelly, have a very pretty effect; of course, unless the jelly be very clear, the
beauty of the dish will be spoiled. It may be garnished with the same fruit as is laid in the
jelly; for instance, an open jelly with strawberries might have, piled in the centre, a few
of the same fruit prettily arranged, or a little whipped cream might be substituted for the fruit.

Time.--One layer of jelly should remain 2 hours in a very cool place, before another layer
is added. Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient, with fruit, to fill a quart mould.

Seasonable, with fresh fruit, from June to October; with dried, at any time.

JELLY OF TWO COLOURS.

1441. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of calf's-feet jelly No. 1416, a few drops of prepared cochineal.

Mode.--Make 1-1/2 pint of jelly by recipe No. 1416, or, if wished more economical, of clarified
syrup and gelatine, flavouring it in any way that may be preferred. Colour one-half of the
jelly with a few drops of prepared cochineal, and the other half leave as pale as possible.
Have ready a mould well wetted in every part; pour in a small quantity of the red jelly, and
let this set; when quite firm, pour on it the same quantity of the pale jelly, and let this
set; then proceed in this manner until the mould is full, always taking care to let one jelly
set before the other is poured in, or the colours would run one into the other. When turned
out, the jelly should have a striped appearance. For variety, half the mould may be filled
at once with one of the jellies, and, when firm, filled up with the other: this, also, has
a very pretty effect, and is more expeditiously prepared than when the jelly is poured in small
quantities into the mould. Blancmange and red jelly, or blancmange and raspberry cream, moulded
in the above manner, look very well. The layers of blancmange and jelly should be about an
inch in depth, and each layer should be perfectly hardened before another is added. Half a
mould of blancmange and half a mould of jelly are frequently served in the same manner. A few
pretty dishes may be made, in this way, of jellies or blancmanges left from the preceding day,
by melting them separately in a jug placed in a saucepan of boiling water, and then moulding
them by the foregoing directions. (See coloured plate S1.)

Time.--3/4 hour to make the jelly.

Average cost, with calf's-feet jelly, 2s.; with gelatine and syrup, more economical.

Note.--In making the jelly, use for flavouring a very pale sherry, or the colour will be too
dark to contrast nicely with the red jelly.

LEMON BLANCMANGE.

1442. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of milk, the yolks of 4 eggs, 3 oz. of ground rice, 6 oz. of pounded
sugar, 1-1/2 oz. of fresh butter, the rind of 1 lemon, the juice of 2, 1/2 oz. of gelatine.

Mode.--Make a custard with the yolks of the eggs and 1/2 pint of the milk, and, when done,
put it into a basin: put half the remainder of the milk into a saucepan with the ground rice,
fresh butter, lemon-rind, and 3 oz. of the sugar, and let these ingredients boil until the
mixture is stiff, stirring them continually; when done, pour it into the bowl where the custard
is, mixing both well together. Put the gelatine with the rest of the milk into a saucepan,
and let it stand by the side of the fire to dissolve; boil for a minute or two, stir carefully
into the basin, adding 3 oz. more of pounded sugar. When cold, stir in the lemon-juice, which
should be carefully strained, and pour the mixture into a well-oiled mould, leaving out the
lemon-peel, and set the mould in a pan of cold water until wanted for table. Use eggs that
have rich-looking yolks; and, should the weather be very warm, rather a larger proportion of
gelatine must be allowed.

Time.--Altogether, 1 hour. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient to fill 2 small moulds. Seasonable at any time.

LEMON CREAM.

1443. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of cream, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1/4 lb. of white sugar, 1 large lemon,
1 oz. of isinglass.

Mode.--Put the cream into a lined saucepan with the sugar, lemon-peel, and isinglass, and simmer
these over a gentle fire for about 10 minutes, stirring them all the time. Strain the lemon-juice
into a basin, gradually pour on it the cream, and stir it well until the juice is well mixed
with it. Have ready a well-oiled mould, pour the cream into it, and let it remain until perfectly
set. When required for table, loosen the edges with a small blunt knife, put a dish on the
top of the mould, turn it over quickly, and the cream should easily slip away.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the cream; about 10 minutes to stir it over the fire in the jug.

ECONOMICAL LEMON CREAM.

1444. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of milk, 8 bitter almonds, 2 oz. of gelatine, 2 large lemons, 3/4
lb. of lump sugar, the yolks of 6 eggs.

Mode.--Put the milk into a lined saucepan with the almonds, which should be well pounded in
a mortar, the gelatine, lemon-rind, and lump sugar, and boil these ingredients for about 5
minutes. Beat up the yolks of the eggs, strain the milk into a jug, add the eggs, and pour
the mixture backwards and forwards a few times, until nearly cold; then stir briskly to it
the lemon-juice, which should be strained, and keep stirring until the cream is almost cold:
put it into an oiled mould, and let it remain until perfectly set. The lemon-juice must not
be added to the cream when it is warm, and should be well stirred after it is put in.

Time.--5 minutes to boil the milk. Average cost, 2s. 5d.

LEMON CREAMS.

(Very good.)

1445. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of cream, 2 dozen sweet almonds, 3 glasses of sherry, the rind and
juice of 2 lemons, sugar to taste.

Mode.--Blanch and chop the almonds, and put them into a jug with the cream; in another jug
put the sherry, lemon-rind, strained juice, and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole
nicely. Pour rapidly from one jug to the other till the mixture is well frothed; then, pour
it into jelly-glasses, omitting the lemon-rind. This is a very cool and delicious sweet for
summer, and may be made less rich by omitting the almonds and substituting orange or raisin
wine for the sherry.

Sufficient to fill 12 glasses. Seasonable at any time.

LEMON CREAMS OF CUSTARDS.

1446. INGREDIENTS.--5 oz. of loaf sugar, 2 pints of boiling water, the rind of 1 lemon and
the juice of 3, the yolks of 8 eggs.

Mode.--Make a quart of lemonade in the following manner:--Dissolve the sugar in the boiling
water, having previously, with part of the sugar, rubbed off the lemon-rind, and add the strained
juice. Strain the lemonade into a saucepan, and add the yolks of the eggs, which should be
well beaten; stir this one way over the fire until the mixture thickens, but do not allow it
to boil, and serve in custard-glasses, or on a glass dish. After the boiling water is poured
on the sugar and lemon, it should stand covered for about 1/2 hour before the eggs are added
to it, that the flavour of the rind may be extracted.

Sufficient to fill 12 to 14 custard-glasses. Seasonable at any time.

LEMON JELLY.

1447. INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 3/4 lb. of lump sugar, 1 pint of water, 1-1/2 oz. of isinglass,
1/4 pint of sherry.

Mode.--Peel 3 of the lemons, pour 1/2 pint of boiling water on the rind, and let it infuse
for 1/2 hour; put the sugar, isinglass, and 1/2 pint of water into a lined saucepan, and boil
these ingredients for 20 minutes; then put in the strained lemon-juice, the strained infusion
of the rind, and bring the whole to the point of boiling; skim well, add the wine, and run
the jelly through a bag; pour it into a mould that has been wetted or soaked in water; put
it in ice, if convenient, where let it remain until required for table. Previously to adding
the lemon-juice to the other ingredients, ascertain that it is very nicely strained, as, if
this is not properly attended to, it is liable to make the jelly thick and muddy. As this jelly
is very pale, and almost colourless, it answers very well for moulding with a jelly of any
bright hue; for instance, half a jelly bright red, and the other half made of the above, would
have a very good effect. Lemon jelly may also be made with calf's-feet stock, allowing the
juice of 3 lemons to every pint of stock.

Time.--Altogether, 1 hour.

Average cost, with the best isinglass, 2s. 9d.

LEMON SPONGE.

1448. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of isinglass, 1-3/4 pint of water, 3/4 lb. of pounded sugar, the
juice of 5 lemons, the rind of 1, the whites of 3 eggs.

Mode.--Dissolve the isinglass in the water, strain it into a saucepan, and add the sugar, lemon-rind,
and juice. Boil the whole from 10 to 15 minutes; strain it again, and let it stand till it
is cold and begins to stiffen. Beat the whites of the eggs, put them to it, and whisk the mixture
till it is quite white; put it into a mould which has been previously wetted, and let it remain
until perfectly set; then turn it out, and garnish it according to taste.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes. Average cost, with the best isinglass, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

LIQUEUR JELLY.

1449. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of lump sugar, 2 oz. of isinglass, 1-1/2 pint of water, the juice
of 2 lemons, 1/4 pint of liqueur.

Mode.--Put the sugar, with 1 pint of the water, into a stewpan, and boil them gently by the
side of the fire until there is no scum remaining, which must be carefully removed as fast
as it rises. Boil the isinglass with the other 1/2 pint of water, and skim it carefully in
the same manner. Strain the lemon-juice, and add it, with the clarified isinglass, to the syrup;
put in the liqueur, and bring the whole to the boiling-point. Let the saucepan remain covered
by the side of the fire for a few minutes; then pour the jelly through a bag, put it into a
mould, and set the mould in ice until required for table. Dip the mould in hot water, wipe
the outside, loosen the jelly by passing a knife round the edges, and turn it out carefully
on a dish. Noyeau, Maraschino, Curaçoa, brandy, or any kind of liqueur, answers for this jelly;
and, when made with isinglass, liqueur jellies are usually prepared as directed above.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the sugar and water.

A SWEET DISH OF MACARONI.

1450. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of macaroni, 1-1/2 pint of milk, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 3 oz. of
lump sugar, 3/4 pint of custard No. 1423.

Mode.--Put the milk into a saucepan, with the lemon-peel and sugar; bring it to the boiling-point,
drop in the macaroni, and let it gradually swell over a gentle fire, but do not allow the pipes
to break. The form should be entirely preserved; and, though tender, should be firm, and not
soft, with no part beginning to melt. Should the milk dry away before the macaroni is sufficiently
swelled, add a little more. Make a custard by recipe No. 1423; place the macaroni on a dish,
and pour the custard over the hot macaroni; grate over it a little nutmeg, and, when cold,
garnish the dish with slices of candied citron.

Time.--From 40 to 50 minutes to swell the macaroni.

Average cost, with the custard, 1s.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time.

MERINGUES.

1451. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of pounded sugar, the whites of 4 eggs.

Mode.--Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and, with a wooden spoon, stir in quickly
the pounded sugar; and have some boards thick enough to put in the oven to prevent the bottom
of the meringues from acquiring too much colour. Cut some strips of paper about 2 inches wide;
place this paper on the board, and drop a tablespoonful at a time of the mixture on the paper,
taking care to let all the meringues be the same size. In dropping it from the spoon, give
the mixture the form of an egg, and keep the meringues about 2 inches apart from each other
on the paper. Strew over them some sifted sugar, and bake in a moderate oven for 1/2 hour.
As soon as they begin to colour, remove them from the oven; take each slip of paper by the
two ends, and turn it gently on the table, and, with a small spoon, take out the soft part
of each meringue. Spread some clean paper on the board, turn the meringues upside down, and
put them into the oven to harden and brown on the other side. When required for table, fill
them with whipped cream, flavoured with liqueur or vanilla, and sweetened with pounded sugar.
Join two of the meringues together, and pile them high in the dish, as shown in the annexed
drawing. To vary their appearance, finely-chopped almonds or currants may be strewn over them
before the sugar is sprinkled over; and they may be garnished with any bright-coloured preserve.
Great expedition is necessary in making this sweet dish; as, if the meringues are not put into
the oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are mixed, the former melts, and the mixture would run
on the paper, instead of keeping its egg-shape. The sweeter the meringues are made, the crisper
will they be; but, if there is not sufficient sugar mixed with them, they will most likely
be tough. They are sometimes coloured with cochineal; and, if kept well covered in a dry place,
will remain good for a month or six weeks.

Sufficient to make 2 dozen meringues. Seasonable at any time.

NOYEAU CREAM.

1452. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of isinglass, the juice of 2 lemons, noyeau and pounded sugar
to taste, 1-1/2 pint of cream.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

OPEN JELLY WITH WHIPPED CREAM.

(A very pretty dish.)

1453. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of jelly, 1/2 pint of cream, 1 glass of sherry, sugar to taste.

Mode.--Make the above proportion of calf's-feet or isinglass jelly, colouring and flavouring
it in any way that may be preferred; soak a mould, open in the centre, for about 1/2 hour in
cold water; fill it with the jelly, and let it remain in a cool place until perfectly set;
then turn it out on a dish; fill the centre with whipped cream, flavoured with sherry and sweetened
with pounded sugar; pile this cream high in the centre, and serve. The jelly should be made
of rather a dark colour, to contrast nicely with the cream.

ORANGE JELLY.

1454. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of water, 1-1/2 to 2 oz. of isinglass, 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar, 1
Seville orange, 1 lemon, about 9 China oranges.

Mode.--Put the water into a saucepan, with the isinglass, sugar, and the rind of 1 orange,
and the same of 1/2 lemon, and stir these over the fire until the isinglass is dissolved, and
remove the scum; then add to this the juice of the Seville orange, the juice of the lemon,
and sufficient juice of China oranges to make in all 1 pint; from 8 to 10 oranges will yield
the desired quantity. Stir all together over the fire until it is just on the point of boiling;
skim well; then strain the jelly through a very fine sieve or jelly-bag, and when nearly cold,
put it into a mould previously wetted, and, when quite set, turn it out on a dish, and garnish
it to taste. To insure this jelly being clear, the orange-and lemon-juice should be well strained,
and the isinglass clarified, before they are added to the other ingredients, and, to heighten
the colour, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added.

Time.--5 minutes to boil without the juice; 1 minute after it is added.

ORANGE JELLY MOULDED WITH SLICES OF ORANGE.

1455. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of orange jelly No. 1454, 4 oranges, 1 pint of clarified syrup.

Mode.--Boil 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar with 1/2 pint of water until there is no scum left (which
must be carefully removed as fast as it rises), and carefully peel the oranges; divide them
into thin slices, without breaking the thin skin, and put these pieces of orange into the syrup,
where let them remain for about 5 minutes; then take them out, and use the syrup for the jelly,
which should be made by recipe No. 1454. When the oranges are well drained, and the jelly is
nearly cold, pour a little of the latter into the bottom of the mould; then lay in a few pieces
of orange; over these pour a little jelly, and when this is set, place another layer of oranges,
proceeding in this manner until the mould is full. Put it in ice, or in a cool place, and,
before turning it out, wrap a cloth round the mould for a minute or two, which has been wrung
out in boiling water.

Time.--5 minutes to simmer the oranges. Average cost, 3s. 6d.

Sufficient, with the slices of orange, to fill a quart mould.

Seasonable from November to May.

TO MAKE A PLAIN OMELET.

1456. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1/3 saltspoonful of pepper, 1/4 lb. of butter.

Mode.--Break the eggs into a basin, omitting the whites of 3, and beat them up with the salt
and pepper until extremely light; then add 2 oz. of the butter broken into small pieces, and
stir this into the mixture. Put the other 2 oz. of butter into a frying-pan, make it quite
hot, and, as soon as it begins to bubble, whisk the eggs, &c. very briskly for a minute or
two, and pour them into the pan; stir the omelet with a spoon one way until the mixture thickens
and becomes firm, and when the whole is set, fold the edges over, so that the omelet assumes
an oval form; and when it is nicely brown on one side, and quite firm, it is done. To take
off the rawness on the upper side, hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two, and brown
it with a salamander or hot shovel. Serve very expeditiously on a very hot dish, and never
cook it until it is just wanted. The flavour of this omelet may be very much enhanced by adding
minced parsley, minced onion or eschalot, or grated cheese, allowing 1 tablespoonful of the
former, and half the quantity of the latter, to the above proportion of eggs. Shrimps or oysters
may also be added: the latter should be scalded in their liquor, and then bearded and cut into
small pieces. In making an omelet, be particularly careful that it is not too thin, and, to
avoid this, do not make it in too large a frying-pan, as the mixture would then spread too
much, and taste of the outside. It should also not be greasy, burnt, or too much done, and
should be cooked over a gentle fire, that the whole of the substance may be heated without
drying up the outside. Omelets are sometimes served with gravy; but this should never be poured
over them, but served in a tureen, as the liquid causes the omelet to become heavy and flat,
instead of eating light and soft. In making the gravy, the flavour should not overpower that
of the omelet, and should be thickened with arrowroot or rice flour.

Time.--With 6 eggs, in a frying-pan 18 or 20 inches round, 4 to 6 minutes. Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

HAM OMELET (A delicious Breakfast Dish.)

1457. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, 1/2 saltspoonful of pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls of
minced ham.

Mode.--Mince the ham very finely, without any fat, and fry it for 2 minutes in a little butter;
then make the batter for the omelet, stir in the ham, and proceed as directed in recipe No.
1456. Do not add any salt to the batter, as the ham is usually sufficiently salt to impart
a flavour to the omelet. Good lean bacon, or tongue, answers equally well for this dish; but
they must also be slightly cooked previously to mixing them with the batter. Serve very hot
and quickly, without gravy.

Time.--From 4 to 6 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

KIDNEY OMELET (A favourite French dish.)

1458. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1/2 saltspoonful of pepper, 2 sheep's kidneys,
or 2 tablespoonfuls of minced veal kidney, 5 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Skin the kidneys, cut them into small dice, and toss them in a frying-pan, in 1 oz.
of butter, over the fire for 2 or 3 minutes. Mix the ingredients for the omelet the same as
in recipe No. 1456, and when the eggs are well whisked, stir in the pieces of kidney. Make
the butter hot in the frying-pan, and when it bubbles, pour in the omelet, and fry it over
a gentle fire from 4 to 6 minutes. When the eggs are set, fold the edges over, so that the
omelet assumes an oval form, and be careful that it is not too much done: to brown the top,
hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two, or use a salamander until the desired colour
is obtained, but never turn an omelet in the pan. Slip it carefully on to a very hot dish,
or, what is a much safer method, put a dish on the omelet, and turn the pan quickly over. It
should be served the instant it comes from the fire.

TO MAKE A PLAIN SWEET OMELET.

1459. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of sifted sugar.

Mode.--Break the eggs into a basin, omitting the whites of 3; whisk them well, adding the sugar
and 2 oz. of the butter, which should be broken into small pieces, and stir all these ingredients
well together. Make the remainder of the butter quite hot in a small frying-pan, and when it
commences to bubble, pour in the eggs, &c. Keep stirring them until they begin to set; then
turn the edges of the omelet over, to make it an oval shape, and finish cooking it. To brown
the top, hold the pan before the fire, or use a salamander, and turn it carefully on to a very
hot dish: sprinkle sifted sugar over, and serve.

Time.--From 4 to 6 minutes. Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

OMELETTE AUX CONFITURES, or JAM OMELET.

1460. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of apricot, strawberry, or any
jam that may be preferred.

Mode.--Make the omelet by recipe No. 1459, only instead of doubling it over, leave it flat
in the pan. When quite firm, and nicely brown on one side, turn it carefully on to a hot dish,
spread over the middle of it the jam, and fold the omelet over on each side; sprinkle sifted
sugar over, and serve very quickly. A pretty dish of small omelets may be made by dividing
the batter into 3 or 4 portions, and frying them separately; they should then be spread each
one with a different kind of preserve, and the omelets rolled over. Always sprinkle sweet omelets
with sifted sugar before being sent to table.

Time.--4 to 6 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 2d.

Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

OMELETTE SOUFFLÉ.

1461. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 5 oz. of pounded sugar, flavouring of vanilla, orange-flower water,
or lemon-rind, 3 oz. of butter, 1 dessert-spoonful of rice-flour.

Mode.--Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, add to the former the sugar, the rice-flour,
and either of the above flavourings that may be preferred, and stir these ingredients well
together. Whip the whites of the eggs, mix them lightly with the batter, and put the butter
into a small frying-pan. As soon as it begins to bubble, pour the batter into it, and set the
pan over a bright but gentle fire; and when the omelet is set, turn the edges over to make
it an oval shape, and slip it on to a silver dish, which has been previously well buttered.
Put it in the oven, and bake from 12 to 15 minutes; sprinkle finely-powdered sugar over the
soufflé, and serve it immediately.

Time.--About 4 minutes in the pan; to bake, from 12 to 15 minutes.

Average cost. 1s.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

BACHELOR'S OMELET.

1462. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 1/2 teacupful of milk.

Mode.--Make a thin cream of the flour and milk; then beat up the eggs, mix all together, and
add a pinch of salt and a few grains of cayenne. Melt the butter in a small frying-pan, and,
when very hot, pour in the batter. Let the pan remain for a few minutes over a clear fire;
then sprinkle upon the omelet some chopped herbs and a few shreds of onion; double the omelet
dexterously, and shake it out of the pan on to a hot dish. A simple sweet omelet can be made
by the same process, substituting sugar or preserve for the chopped herbs.

Time.--2 minutes.

Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient for 2 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

ORANGE CREAM.

1463. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of isinglass, 6 large oranges, 1 lemon, sugar to taste, water, 1/2
pint of good cream.

Mode.--Squeeze the juice from the oranges and lemon; strain it, and put it into a saucepan
with the isinglass, and sufficient water to make in all 1-1/2 pint. Rub the sugar on the orange
and lemon-rind, add it to the other ingredients, and boil all together for about 10 minutes.
Strain through a muslin bag, and, when cold, beat up with it 1/2 pint of thick cream. Wet a
mould, or soak it in cold water; pour in the cream, and put it in a cool place to set. If the
weather is very cold, 1 oz. of isinglass will be found sufficient for the above proportion
of ingredients.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the juice and water.

Average cost, with the best isinglass, 3s.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould.

Seasonable from November to May.

ORANGE CREAMS.

1464. INGREDIENTS.--1 Seville orange, 1 tablespoonful of brandy, 1/4 lb. of loaf sugar, the
yolks of 4 eggs, 1 pint of cream.

Mode.--Boil the rind of the Seville orange until tender, and beat it in a mortar to a pulp;
add to it the brandy, the strained juice of the orange, and the sugar, and beat all together
for about 10 minutes, adding the well-beaten yolks of eggs. Bring the cream to the boiling-point,
and pour it very gradually to the other ingredients, and beat the mixture till nearly cold;
put it into custard-cups, place the cups in a deep dish of boiling water, where let them remain
till quite cold. Take the cups out of the water, wipe them, and garnish the tops of the creams
with candied orange-peel or preserved chips.

Time.--Altogether, 3/4 hour.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 1s. 7d.

Sufficient to make 7 or 8 creams.

Seasonable from November to May.

Note.--To render this dish more economical, substitute milk for the cream, but add a small
pinch of isinglass to make the creams firm.

    SEVILLE ORANGE (Citrus vulgaris).--This variety, called also
    bitter orange, is of the same species as the sweet orange, and
    grows in great abundance on the banks of the Guadalquiver, in
    Andalusia, whence this fruit is chiefly obtained. In that part
    of Spain there are very extensive orchards of these oranges,
    which form the chief wealth of the monasteries. The pulp of the
    bitter orange is not eaten raw. In the yellow rind, separated
    from the white spongy substance immediately below it, is
    contained an essential oil, which is an agreeable warm aromatic,
    much superior for many purposes to that of the common orange.
    The best marmalade and the richest wine are made from this
    orange; and from its flowers the best orange-flower water is
    distilled. Seville oranges are also preserved whole as a
    sweetmeat.

ORANGE FRITTERS.

1465.

Mode.--Make a nice light batter with the above proportion of flour, butter, salt, eggs, and
sufficient milk to make it the proper consistency; peel the oranges, remove as much of the
white skin as possible, and divide each orange into eight pieces, without breaking the thin
skin, unless it be to remove the pips; dip each piece of orange in the batter. Have ready a
pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; drop in the oranges, and fry them a delicate brown
from 8 to 10 minutes. When done, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire, to
drain away the greasy moisture, and dish them on a white d'oyley; sprinkle over them plenty
of pounded sugar, and serve quickly.

A PRETTY DISH OF ORANGES.

1466.

Mode.--Put the sugar and water into a saucepan, and boil them until the sugar becomes brittle,
which may be ascertained by taking up a small quantity in a spoon, and dipping it in cold water;
if the sugar is sufficiently boiled, it will easily snap. Peel the oranges, remove as much
of the white pith as possible, and divide them into nice-sized slices, without breaking the
thin white skin which surrounds the juicy pulp. Place the pieces of orange on small skewers,
dip them into the hot sugar, and arrange them in layers round a plain mould, which should be
well oiled with the purest salad-oil. The sides of the mould only should be lined with the
oranges, and the centre left open for the cream. Let the sugar become firm by cooling; turn
the oranges carefully out on a dish, and fill the centre with whipped cream, flavoured with
any kind of liqueur, and sweetened with pounded sugar. This is an exceedingly ornamental and
nice dish for the supper-table.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the sugar. Average cost, 1s. 8d.

Sufficient for 1 mould. Seasonable from November to May.

TO MAKE PANCAKES.

1467. INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, flour, milk; to every egg allow 1 oz. of flour, about 1 gill of milk,
1/8 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Ascertain that the eggs are fresh; break each one separately in a cup; whisk them well,
put them into a basin, with the flour, salt, and a few drops of milk, and beat the whole to
a perfectly smooth batter; then add by degrees the remainder of the milk. The proportion of
this latter ingredient must be regulated by the size of the eggs, &c. &c.; but the batter,
when ready for frying, should be of the consistency of thick cream. Place a small frying-pan
on the fire to get hot; let it be delicately clean, or the pancakes will stick, and, when quite
hot, put into it a small piece of butter, allowing about 1/2 oz. to each pancake. When it is
melted, pour in the batter, about 1/2 teacupful to a pan 5 inches in diameter, and fry it for
about 4 minutes, or until it is nicely brown on one side. By only pouring in a small quantity
of batter, and so making the pancakes thin, the necessity of turning them (an operation rather
difficult to unskilful cooks) is obviated. When the pancake is done, sprinkle over it some
pounded sugar, roll it up in the pan, and take it out with a large slice, and place it on a
dish before the fire. Proceed in this manner until sufficient are cooked for a dish; then send
them quickly to table, and continue to send in a further quantity, as pancakes are never good
unless eaten almost immediately they come from the frying-pan. The batter may be flavoured
with a little grated lemon-rind, or the pancakes may have preserve rolled in them instead of
sugar. Send sifted sugar and a cut lemon to table with them. To render the pancakes very light,
the yolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten separately, and the whites added the last
thing to the batter before frying.

Time.--from 4 to 6 minutes for a pancake that does not require turning; from 6 to 8 minutes
for a thicker one.

Average cost, for 3 persons, 6d.

Sufficient.--Allow 3 eggs, with the other ingredients in proportion, for 3 persons.

Seasonable at any time, but specially served on Shrove Tuesday.

RICHER PANCAKES.

1468. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 pint of cream, 1/4 lb. of loaf sugar, 1 glass of sherry, 1/2
teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, flour.

Mode.--Ascertain that the eggs are extremely fresh, beat them well, strain and mix with them
the cream, pounded sugar, wine, nutmeg, and as much flour as will make the batter nearly as
thick as that for ordinary pancakes. Make the frying-pan hot, wipe it with a clean cloth, pour
in sufficient batter to make a thin pancake, and fry it for about 5 minutes. Dish the pancakes
piled one above the other, strew sifted sugar between each, and serve.

Time.--About 5 minutes.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 2s. 3d.

Sufficient to make 8 pancakes.

Seasonable at any time, but specially served on Shrove Tuesday.

PEACH FRITTERS.

1469.

Mode.--Make a nice smooth, batter in the same manner as directed in recipe No. 1393, and skin,
halve, and stone the peaches, which should be quite ripe; dip them in the batter, and fry the
pieces in hot lard or clarified dripping, which should be brought to the boiling-point before
the peaches are put in. From 8 to 10 minutes will be required to fry them, and, when done,
drain them before the fire, and dish them on a white d'oyley. Strew over plenty of pounded
sugar, and serve.

Time.--From 8 to 10 minutes to fry the fritters, 6 minutes to drain them.

    PEACH.--The peach and nectarine are amongst the most delicious
    of our fruits, and are considered as varieties of the same
    species produced by cultivation. The former is characterized by
    a very delicate down, while the latter is smooth; but, as a
    proof of their identity as to species, trees have borne peaches
    in one part and nectarines in another; and even a single fruit
    has had down on one side and the other smooth. The trees are
    almost exactly alike, as well as the blossoms. Pliny states that
    the peach was originally brought from Persia, where it grows
    naturally, from which the name of Persica was bestowed upon it
    by the Romans; and some modern botanists apply this as the
    generic name, separating them from Amygdalus, or Almond, to
    which Linnaeus had united them. Although they are not tropical,
    they require a great deal of warmth to bring them to perfection:
    hence they seldom ripen in this country, in ordinary seasons,
    without the use of walls or glass; consequently, they bear a
    high price. In a good peach, the flesh is firm, the skin thin,
    of a deep bright colour next the sun and of a yellowish green
    next to the wall; the pulp is yellowish, full of
    highly-flavoured juice, the fleshy part thick, and the stone
    small. Too much down is a sign of inferior quality. This fruit
    is much used at the dessert, and makes a delicious preserve.

PEARS A L'ALLEMANDE.

1470. INGREDIENTS.--6 to 8 pears, water, sugar, 2 oz. of butter, the yolk of an egg, 1/2 oz.
of gelatine.

Mode.--Peel and cut the pears into any form that may be preferred, and steep them in cold water
to prevent them turning black; put them into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover
them, and boil them with the butter and enough sugar to sweeten them nicely, until tender;
then brush the pears over with the yolk of an egg, sprinkle them with sifted sugar, and arrange
them on a dish. Add the gelatine to the syrup, boil it up quickly for about 5 minutes, strain
it over the pears, and let it remain until set. The syrup may be coloured with a little prepared
cochineal, which would very much improve the appearance of the dish.

Time.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to stew the pears; 5 minutes to boil the syrup.

Average cost, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient for a large dish.

Seasonable from August to February.

MOULDED PEARS.

1471. When done, lay the pears in a plain mould, which should be well wetted, and boil 1/2
pint of the liquor the pears were baked in with the wine, lemon-peel, strained juice, and gelatine.
Let these ingredients boil quickly for 5 minutes, then strain the liquid warm over the pears;
put the mould in a cool place, and when the jelly is firm, turn it out on a glass dish.

Time.--2 hours to bake the pears in a cool oven.

Average cost, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient for a quart mould.

Seasonable from August to February

PINEAPPLE FRITTERS.

(An elegant Dish.)

1472. INGREDIENTS.--A small pineapple, a small wineglassful of brandy or liqueur, 2 oz. of
sifted sugar; batter as for apple fritters No. 1393.

Mode.--This elegant dish, although it may appear extravagant, is really not so if made when
pineapples are plentiful. We receive them now in such large quantities from the West Indies,
that at times they may be purchased at an exceedingly low rate: it would not, of course, be
economical to use the pines which are grown in our English pineries for the purposes of fritters.
Pare the pine with as little waste as possible, cut it into rather thin slices, and soak these
slices in the above proportion of brandy or liqueur and pounded sugar for 4 hours; then make
a batter the same as for apple fritters, substituting cream for the milk, and using a smaller
quantity of flour; and, when this is ready, dip in the pieces of pine, and fry them in boiling
lard from 5 to 8 minutes; turn them when sufficiently brown on one side, and, when done, drain
them from the lard before the fire, dish them on a white d'oyley, strew over them sifted sugar,
and serve quickly.

Time.--5 to 8 minutes.

Average cost, when cheap and plentiful, 1s. 6d. for the pine.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable in July and August.

    PINEAPPLE.--The pineapple has not been known in Europe above two
    hundred years, and has not been cultivated in England much above
    a century. It is stated that the first pineapples raised in
    Europe were by M. La Cour, of Leyden, about the middle of the
    17th century; and it is said to have been first cultivated in
    England by Sir Matthew Decker, of Richmond. In Kensington
    Palace, there is a picture in which Charles II. is represented
    as receiving a pineapple from his gardener Rose, who is
    presenting it on his knees.

PLAIN FRITTERS.

1473. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of flour, 3 eggs, 1/3 pint of milk.

Mode.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter with a small quantity of the milk; stir in the eggs,
which should be well whisked, and then the remainder of the milk; boat the whole to a perfectly
smooth batter, and should it be found not quite thin enough, add two or three tablespoonfuls
more milk. Have ready a frying-pan, with plenty of boiling lard in it; drop in rather more
than a tablespoonful at a time of the batter, and fry the fritters a nice brown, turning them
when sufficiently cooked on one side. Drain them well from the greasy moisture by placing them
upon a piece of blotting-paper before the fire; dish them on a white d'oyley, sprinkle over
them sifted sugar, and send to table with them a cut lemon and plenty of pounded sugar.

Time.--From 6 to 8 minutes.

Average cost, 4d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons.

Seasonable at any time.

POTATO FRITTERS.

1474. INGREDIENTS.--2 large potatoes, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 ditto of raisin
or sweet wine, 1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, 4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, hot lard.

Mode.--Boil the potatoes, and beat them up lightly with a fork, but do not use a spoon, as
that would make them heavy. Beat the eggs well, leaving out one of the whites; add the other
ingredients, and beat all together for at least 20 minutes, or until the batter is extremely
light. Put plenty of good lard into a frying-pan, and drop a tablespoonful of the batter at
a time into it, and fry the fritters a nice brown. Serve them with the following sauce:--A
glass of sherry mixed with the strained juice of a lemon, and sufficient white sugar to sweeten
the whole nicely. Warm these ingredients, and serve the sauce separately in a tureen. The fritters
should be neatly dished on a white d'oyley, and pounded sugar sprinkled over them; and they
should be well drained on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire previously to being dished.

Time.--From 6 to 8 minutes.

RASPBERRY CREAM.

1475. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 pint of milk, 3/4 pint of cream, 1-1/2 oz. of isinglass, raspberry
jelly, sugar to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy.

Mode.--Boil the milk, cream, and isinglass together for 1/4 hour, or until the latter is melted,
and strain it through a hair sieve into a basin. Let it cool a little; then add to it sufficient
raspberry jelly, which, when melted, would make 1/3 pint, and stir well till the ingredients
are thoroughly mixed. If not sufficiently sweet, add a little pounded sugar with the brandy;
whisk the mixture well until nearly cold, put it into a well-oiled mould, and set it in a cool
place till perfectly set. Raspberry jam may be substituted for the jelly, but must be melted,
and rubbed through a sieve, to free it from seeds: in summer, the juice of the fresh fruit
may be used, by slightly mashing it with a wooden spoon, and sprinkling sugar over it; the
juice that flows from the fruit should then be used for mixing with the cream. If the colour
should not be very good, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added to improve its appearance.
(See coloured plate T1.)

Time.--1/4 hour to boil the cream and isinglass.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, and the best isinglass, 3s.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould.

Seasonable, with jelly, at any time.

Note.--Strawberry cream may be made in precisely the same manner, substituting strawberry jam
or jelly for the raspberry.

RICE BLANCMANGE.

1476. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of ground rice, 3 oz. of loaf sugar, 1 oz. of fresh butter, 1 quart
of milk, flavouring of lemon-peel, essence of almonds or vanilla, or laurel-leaves.

Mode.--Mix the rice to a smooth batter with about 1/2 pint of the milk, and the remainder put
into a saucepan, with the sugar, butter, and whichever of the above flavourings may be preferred;
bring the milk to the boiling-point, quickly stir in the rice, and let it boil for about 10
minutes, or until it comes easily away from the saucepan, keeping it well stirred the whole
time. Grease a mould with pure salad-oil; pour in the rice, and let it get perfectly set, when
it should turn out quite easily; garnish it with jam, or pour round a compôte of any kind of
fruit, just before it is sent to table. This blancmange is better for being made the day before
it is wanted, as it then has time to become firm. If laurel-leaves are used for flavouring,
steep 3 of them in the milk, and take them out before the rice is added: about 8 drops of essence
of almonds, or from 12 to 16 drops of essence of vanilla, would be required to flavour the
above proportion of milk.

Time.--From 10 to 15 minutes to boil the rice.

Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould.

Seasonable at any time.

RICE CROQUETTES.

1477. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice, 1 quart of milk, 6 oz. of pounded sugar, flavouring of
vanilla, lemon-peel, or bitter almonds, egg and bread crumbs, hot lard.

Mode.--Put the rice, milk, and sugar into a saucepan, and let the former gradually swell over
a gentle fire until all the milk is dried up; and just before the rice is done, stir in a few
drops of essence of any of the above flavourings. Let the rice get cold; then form it into
small round balls, dip them into yolk of egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and fry them
in boiling lard for about 10 minutes, turning them about, that they may get equally browned.
Drain the greasy moisture from them, by placing them on a cloth in front of the fire for a
minute or two; pile them on a white d'oyley, and send them quickly to table. A small piece
of jam is sometimes introduced into the middle of each croquette, which adds very much to the
flavour of this favourite dish.

Time.--From 3/4 to 1 hour to swell the rice; about 10 minutes to fry the croquettes.

Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient to make 7 or 8 croquettes.

Seasonable at any time.

RICE FRITTERS.

1478. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, 3 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of fresh butter 6
oz. of orange marmalade, 4 eggs.

Mode.--Swell the rice in the milk, with the sugar and butter, over a slow fire until it is
perfectly tender, which will be in about 3/4 hour. When the rice is done, strain away the milk,
should there be any left, and mix with it the marmalade and well-beaten eggs; stir the whole
over the fire until the eggs are set; then spread the mixture on a dish to the thickness of
about 1/2 inch, or rather thicker. When it is perfectly cold, cut it into long strips, dip
them in a batter the same as for apple fritters, and fry them a nice brown.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient to make 7 or 8 fritters.

Seasonable at any time.

RICE SNOWBALLS. (A pretty dish for Juvenile Suppers.)

1479. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, flavouring of essence of almonds, sugar
to taste, 1 pint of custard made by recipe No. 1423.

Mode.--Boil the rice in the milk, with sugar and a flavouring of essence of almonds, until
the former is tender, adding, if necessary, a little more milk, should it dry away too much.
When the rice is quite soft, put it into teacups, or small round jars, and let it remain until
cold; then turn the rice out on a deep glass dish, pour over a custard made by recipe No. 1423,
and, on the top of each ball place a small piece of bright-coloured preserve or jelly. Lemon-peel
or vanilla may be boiled with the rice instead of the essence of almonds, when either of these
is preferred; but the flavouring of the custard must correspond with that of the rice.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice in the milk.

Average cost, with the custard, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 children.

Seasonable at any time.

RICE SOUFFLE.

1480. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of ground rice, 1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, pounded sugar
to taste, flavouring of lemon-rind, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, or anything that may be preferred,
a piece of butter the size of a walnut.

Mode.--Mix the ground rice with 6 tablespoonfuls of the milk quite smoothly, and put it into
a saucepan with the remainder of the milk and butter, and keep stirring it over the fire for
about 1/4 hour, or until the mixture thickens. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs,
beat the former in a basin, and stir to them the rice and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten
the soufflé; but add this latter ingredient as sparingly as possible, as, the less sugar there
is used, the lighter will be the soufflé. Now whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth
or snow; mix them with the other preparation, and pour the whole into a soufflé-dish, and put
it instantly into the oven; bake it about 1/2 hour in a moderate oven; take it out, hold a
salamander or hot shovel over the top, sprinkle sifted sugar over it, and send the soufflé
to table in the dish it was baked in, either with a napkin pinned round, or inclosed in a more
ornamental dish. The excellence of this fashionable dish entirely depends on the proper whisking
of the whites of the eggs, the manner of baking, and the expedition with which it is sent to
table. Soufflés should be served instantly from the oven, or they will sink, and be nothing
more than an ordinary pudding.

TO MAKE A SOUFFLE.

1481. INGREDIENTS.--3 heaped tablespoonfuls of potato-flour, rice-flour, arrowroot, or tapioca,
1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, sifted sugar to taste, 1/4
saltspoonful of salt flavouring.

Mode.--Mix the potato-flour, or whichever one of the above ingredients is used, with a little
of the milk; put it into a saucepan, with the remainder of the milk, the butter, salt, and
sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. Stir these ingredients over the fire
until the mixture thickens; then take it off the fire, and let it cool a little. Separate the
whites from the yolks of the eggs, beat the latter, and stir them into the soufflé batter.
Now whisk the whites of the eggs to the firmest possible froth, for on this depends the excellence
of the dish; stir them to the other ingredients, and add a few drops of essence of any flavouring
that may be preferred; such as vanilla, lemon, orange, ginger, &c. &c. Pour the batter into
a soufflé-dish, put it immediately into the oven, and bake for about 1/2 hour; then take it
out, put the dish into another more ornamental one, such as is made for the purpose; hold a
salamander or hot shovel over the soufflé, strew it with sifted sugar, and send it instantly
to table. The secret of making a soufflé well, is to have the eggs well whisked, but particularly
the whites, the oven not too hot, and to send it to table the moment it comes from the oven.
If the soufflé be ever so well made, and it is allowed to stand before being sent to table,
its appearance and goodness will be entirely spoiled. Soufflés may be flavoured in various
ways, but must be named accordingly. Vanilla is one of the most delicate and recherché flavourings
that can be used for this very fashionable dish.

Time.--About 1/2 hour in the oven; 2 or 3 minutes to hold the salamander over.

SNOW EGGS, or OEUFS A LA NEIGE.

(A very pretty Supper Dish.)

1482. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 3/4 pint of milk, pounded sugar to taste, flavouring of vanilla,
lemon-rind, or orange-flower water.

Mode.--Put the milk into a saucepan with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely, and the rind
of 1/2 lemon. Let this steep by the side of the fire for 1/2 hour, when take out the peel;
separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, and whisk the former to a perfectly stiff froth,
or until there is no liquid remaining; bring the milk to the boiling-point, and drop in the
snow a tablespoonful at a time, and keep turning the eggs until sufficiently cooked. Pour this
custard over the eggs, when they should rise to the surface. They make an exceedingly pretty
addition to a supper, and should be put in a cold place after being made. When they are flavoured
with vanilla or orange-flower water, it is not necessary to steep the milk. A few drops of
the essence of either may be poured in the milk just before the whites are poached. In making
the custard, a little more flavouring and sugar should always be added.

Time.--About 2 minutes to poach the whites; 8 minutes to stir the custard.

Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time.

STONE CREAM OF TOUS LES MOIS.

1483. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of preserve, 1 pint of milk, 2 oz. of lump sugar, 1 heaped tablespoonful
of tous les mois, 3 drops of essence of cloves, 3 drops of almond-flavouring.

Mode.--Place the preserve at the bottom of a glass dish; put the milk into a lined saucepan,
with the sugar, and make it boil. Mix to a smooth batter the tous les mois, with a very little
cold milk; stir it briskly into the boiling milk, add the flavouring, and simmer for 2 minutes.
When rather cool, but before turning solid, pour the cream over the jam, and ornament it with
strips of red-currant jelly or preserved fruit.

STRAWBERRY JELLY.

1484. INGREDIENTS.--Strawberries, pounded sugar; to every pint of juice allow 1-1/4 oz. of
isinglass.

Mode.--Pick the strawberries, put them into a pan, squeeze them well with a wooden spoon, add
sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten them nicely, and let them remain for 1 hour, that the juice
may be extracted; then add 1/2 pint of water to every pint of juice. Strain the strawberry-juice
and water through a bag; measure it, and to every pint allow 1-1/4 oz. of isinglass, melted
and clarified in 1/4 pint of water. Mix this with the juice; put the jelly into a mould, and
set the mould in ice. A little lemon-juice added to the strawberry-juice improves the flavour
of the jelly, if the fruit is very ripe; but it must be well strained before it is put to the
other ingredients, or it will make the jelly muddy.

Time.--1 hour to draw the juice.

Average cost, with the best isinglass, 3s.

Sufficient.--Allow 1-1/2 pint of jelly for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable in June, July, and August.

SWISS CREAM.

1485. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of macaroons or 6 small sponge-cakes, sherry, 1 pint of cream,
5 oz. of lump sugar, 2 large tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, the rind of 1 lemon, the juice of
1/2 lemon, 3 tablespoonfuls of milk.

Mode.--Lay the macaroons or sponge-cakes in a glass dish, and pour over them as much sherry
as will cover them, or sufficient to soak them well. Put the cream into a lined saucepan, with
the sugar and lemon-rind, and let it remain by the side of the fire until the cream is well
flavoured, when take out the lemon-rind. Mix the arrowroot smoothly with the cold milk; add
this to the cream, and let it boil gently for about 3 minutes, keeping it well stirred. Take
it off the fire, stir till nearly cold, when add the lemon-juice, and pour the whole over the
cakes. Garnish the cream with strips of angelica, or candied citron cut thin, or bright-coloured
jelly or preserve. This cream is exceedingly delicious, flavoured with vanilla instead of lemon:
when this flavouring is used, the sherry may be omitted, and the mixture poured over the dry cakes.

Time.--About 1/2 hour to infuse the lemon-rind; 5 minutes to boil the cream.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 3s.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

TO MAKE SYLLABUB.

1486. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of sherry or white wine, 1/2 grated nutmeg, sugar to taste, 1-1/2
pint of milk.

Mode.--Put the wine into a bowl, with the grated nutmeg and plenty of pounded sugar, and milk
into it the above proportion of milk frothed up. Clouted cream may be laid on the top, with
pounded cinnamon or nutmeg and sugar; and a little brandy may be added to the wine before the
milk is put in. In some counties, cider is substituted for the wine: when this is used, brandy
must always be added. Warm milk may be poured on from a spouted jug or teapot; but it must
be held very high.

TIPSY CAKE.

1487. INGREDIENTS.--1 moulded sponge-or Savoy-cake, sufficient sweet wine or sherry to soak
it, 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy, 2 oz. of sweet almonds, 1 pint of rich custard.

Mode.--Procure a cake that is three or four days old,--either sponge, Savoy, or rice answering
for the purpose of a tipsy cake. Cut the bottom of the cake level, to make it stand firm in
the dish; make a small hole in the centre, and pour in and over the cake sufficient sweet wine
or sherry, mixed with the above proportion of brandy, to soak it nicely. When the cake is well
soaked, blanch and cut the almonds into strips, stick them all over the cake, and pour round
it a good custard, made by recipe No. 1423, allowing 8 eggs instead of 5 to the pint of milk.
The cakes are sometimes crumbled and soaked, and a whipped cream heaped over them, the same
as for trifles.

Time.--About 2 hours to soak the cake. Average cost, 4s. 6d.

Sufficient for 1 dish. Seasonable at any time.

    ALMOND.--The almond-tree is a native of warmer climates than
    Britain, and is indigenous to the northern parts of Africa and
    Asia; but it is now commonly cultivated in Italy, Spain, and the
    south of France. It is not usually grown in Britain, and the
    fruit seldom ripens in this country: it is much admired for the
    beauty of its blossoms. In the form of its leaves and blossoms
    it strongly resembles the peach-tree, and is included in the
    same genus by botanists; but the fruit, instead of presenting a
    delicious pulp like the peach, shrivels up as it ripens, and
    becomes only a tough coriaceous covering to the stone inclosing
    the eatable kernel, which is surrounded by a thin bitter skin.
    It flowers early in the spring, and produces fruit in August.
    There are two sorts of almonds,--sweet and bitter; but they are
    considered to be only varieties of the species; and though the
    qualities of the kernels are very different, they are not
    distinguishable by their appearance.

AN EASY WAY OF MAKING A TIPSY CAKE.

1488. INGREDIENTS.--12 stale small sponge-cakes, raisin wine, 1/2 lb. of jam, 1 pint of custard
No. 1423.

Mode.--Soak the sponge-cakes, which should be stale (on this account they should be cheaper),
in a little raisin wine; arrange them on a deep glass dish in four layers, putting a layer
of jam between each, and pour round them a pint of custard, made by recipe No. 1423, decorating
the top with cut preserved fruit.

Time.--2 hours to soak the cakes. Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient for 1 dish. Seasonable at any time.

TO MAKE A TRIFLE.

1489. INGREDIENTS.--For the whip, 1 pint of cream, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, the whites of 2
eggs, a small glass of sherry or raisin wine. For the trifle, 1 pint of custard, made with
8 eggs to a pint of milk; 6 small sponge-cakes, or 6 slices of sponge-cake; 12 macaroons, 2
dozen ratafias, 2 oz. of sweet almonds, the grated rind of 1 lemon, a layer of raspberry or
strawberry jam, 1/2 pint of sherry or sweet wine, 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy.

Mode.--The whip to lay over the top of the trifle should be made the day before it is required
for table, as the flavour is better, and it is much more solid than when prepared the same
day. Put into a large bowl the pounded sugar, the whites of the eggs, which should be beaten
to a stiff froth, a glass of sherry or sweet wine, and the cream. Whisk these ingredients well
in a cool place, and take off the froth with a skimmer as fast as it rises, and put it on a
sieve to drain; continue the whisking till there is sufficient of the whip, which must be put
away in a cool place to drain. The next day, place the sponge-cakes, macaroons, and ratafias
at the bottom of a trifle-dish; pour over them 1/2 pint of sherry or sweet wine, mixed with
6 tablespoonfuls of brandy, and, should this proportion of wine not be found quite sufficient,
add a little more, as the cakes should be well soaked. Over the cakes put the grated lemon-rind,
the sweet almonds, blanched and cut into strips, and a layer of raspberry or strawberry jam.
Make a good custard by recipe No. 1423, using 8 instead of 5 eggs to the pint of milk, and
let this cool a little; then pour it over the cakes, &c. The whip being made the day previously,
and the trifle prepared, there remains nothing to do now but heap the whip lightly over the
top: this should stand as high as possible, and it may be garnished with strips of bright currant
jelly, crystallized sweetmeats, or flowers; the small coloured comfits are sometimes used for
the purpose of garnishing a trifle, but they are now considered rather old-fashioned. (See
coloured plate, V1.)

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 5s. 6d.

Sufficient for 1 trifle. Seasonable at any time.

VANILLA CREAM.

1490. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, the yolks of 8 eggs, 6 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of isinglass,
flavouring to taste of essence of vanilla. Take it off the fire; stir in the isinglass, which
should be previously dissolved in about 1/4 pint of water, and boiled for 2 or 3 minutes; pour
the cream into an oiled mould, put it in a cool place to set, and turn it out carefully on
a dish. Instead of using the essence of vanilla, a pod may be boiled in the milk instead, until
the flavour is well extracted. A pod, or a pod and a half, will be found sufficient for the
above proportion of ingredients.

Time.--About 10 minutes to stir the mixture.

Average cost, with the best isinglass, 2s. 6d.

Sufficient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time.

    VANILLE or VANILLA, is the fruit of the vanillier, a parasitical
    herbaceous plant, which flourishes in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru.
    The fruit is a long capsule, thick and fleshy. Certain species
    of this fruit contain a pulp with a delicious perfume and
    flavour. Vanilla is principally imported from Mexico. The
    capsules for export are always picked at perfect maturity. The
    essence is the form in which it is used generally and most
    conveniently. Its properties are stimulating and exciting. It is
    in daily use for ices, chocolates, and flavouring confections
    generally.

VICTORIA SANDWICHES.

1491. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs; their weight in pounded sugar, butter, and flour; 1/4 saltspoonful
of salt, a layer of any kind of jam or marmalade.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour and pounded sugar; stir these ingredients
well together, and add the eggs, which should be previously thoroughly whisked. When the mixture
has been well beaten for about 10 minutes, butter a Yorkshire-pudding tin, pour in the batter,
and bake it in a moderate oven for 20 minutes. Let it cool, spread one half of the cake with
a layer of nice preserve, place over it the other half of the cake, press the pieces slightly
together, and then cut it into long finger-pieces; pile them in crossbars on a glass dish,
and serve.

Time.--20 minutes.

WHIPPED CREAM, for putting on Trifles, serving in Glasses, &c.

1492. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of cream allow 3 oz. of pounded sugar, 1 glass of sherry
or any kind of sweet white wine, the rind of 1/2 lemon, the white of 1 egg.

Mode.--Rub the sugar on the lemon-rind, and pound it in a mortar until quite fine, and beat
up the white of the egg until quite stiff; put the cream into a large bowl, with the sugar,
wine, and beaten egg, and whip it to a froth; as fast as the froth rises, take it off with
a skimmer, and put it on a sieve to drain, in a cool place. This should be made the day before
it is wanted, as the whip is then so much firmer. The cream should be whipped in a cool place,
and in summer, over ice, if it is obtainable. A plain whipped cream may be served on a glass
dish, and garnished with strips of angelica, or pastry leaves, or pieces of bright-coloured
jelly: it makes a very pretty addition to the supper-table.

Time.--About 1 hour to whip the cream.

Average cost, with cream at 1s. per pint, 1s. 9d.

Sufficient for 1 dish or 1 trifle.

Seasonable at any time.

WHIPPED SYLLABUBS.

1493. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of cream, 1/4 pint of sherry, half that quantity of brandy, the
juice of 1/2 lemon, a little grated nutmeg, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, whipped cream the same
as for trifle No. 1489.

Mode.--Mix all the ingredients together, put the syllabub into glasses, and over the top of
them heap a little whipped cream, made in the same manner as for trifle No. 1489. Solid syllabub
is made by whisking or milling the mixture to a stiff froth, and putting it in the glasses,
without the whipped cream at the top.

Average cost, 1s. 8d.

Sufficient to fill 8 or 9 glasses.

Seasonable at any time.

THE CURE'S OMELET.

"Every one knows," says Brillat Savarin, in his "Physiology of Taste," "that for twenty years
Madame Récamier was the most beautiful woman in Paris. It is also well known that she was exceedingly
charitable, and took a great interest in every benevolent work. Wishing to consult the Curé
of ---- respecting the working of an institution, she went to his house at five o'clock in
the afternoon, and was much astonished at finding him already at his dinner-table.

"Madame Récamier wished to retire, but the Curé would not hear of it. A neat white cloth covered
the table; some good old wine sparkled in a crystal decanter; the porcelain was of the best;
the plates had heaters of boiling water beneath them; a neatly-costumed maid-servant was in
attendance. The repast was a compromise between frugality and luxury. The crawfish-soup had
just been removed, and there was on the table a salmon-trout, an omelet, and a salad.

"'My dinner will tell you,' said the worthy Curé, with a smile, 'that it is fast-day, according
to our Church's regulations.' Madame Récamier and her host attacked the trout, the sauce served
with which betrayed a skilful hand, the countenance of the Curé the while showing satisfaction.

"And now they fell upon the omelet, which was round, sufficiently thick, and cooked, so to
speak, to a hair's-breadth.

"As the spoon entered the omelet, a thick rich juice issued from it, pleasant to the eye as
well as to the smell; the dish became full of it; and our fair friend owns that, between the
perfume and the sight, it made her mouth water.

"'It is an omelette au thon' (that is to say, a tunny omelet), said the Curé, noticing, with
the greatest delight, the emotion of Madame Récamier, 'and few people taste it without lavishing
praises on it.'

"'It surprises me not at all,' returned the beauty; 'never has so enticing an omelet met my
gaze at any of our lay tables.'

"'My cook understands them well, I think.'

"'Yes,' added Madame, 'I never ate anything so delightful.'"

Then came the salad, which Savarin recommends to all who place confidence in him. It refreshes
without exciting; and he has a theory that it makes people younger.

Amidst pleasant converse the dessert arrived. It consisted of three apples, cheese, and a plate
of preserves; and then upon a little round table was served the Mocha coffee, for which France
has been, and is, so justly famous.

"'I never,' said the Curé, 'take spirits; I always offer liqueurs to my guests but reserve
the use of them, myself, to my old age, if it should please Providence to grant me that.'

"Finally, the charming Madame Récamier took her leave, and told all her friends of the delicious
omelet which she had seen and partaken of."

And Brillat Savarin, in his capacity as the Layard of the concealed treasures of Gastronomia,
has succeeded in withdrawing from obscurity the details of the preparation of which so much
had been said, and which he imagines to be as wholesome as it was agreeable.

Here follows the recipe:--

OMELETTE AU THON.

1494. Take, for 6 persons, the roes of 2 carp; [Footnote: An American writer says he has followed
this recipe, substituting pike, shad, &c., in the place of carp, and can recommend all these
also, with a quiet conscience. Any fish, indeed, may be used with success.] bleach them, by
putting them, for 5 minutes, in boiling water slightly salted. Take a piece of fresh tunny
about the size of a hen's egg, to which add a small shalot already chopped; hash up together
the roe and the tunny, so as to mix them well, and throw the whole into a saucepan, with a
sufficient quantity of very good butter: whip it up until the butter is melted! This constitutes
the specialty of the omelet. Take a second piece of butter, à discrétion, mix it with parsley
and herbs, place it in a long-shaped dish destined to receive the omelet; squeeze the juice
of a lemon over it, and place it on hot embers. Beat up 12 eggs (the fresher the better); throw
up the sauté of roe and tunny, stirring it so as to mix all well together; then make your omelet
in the usual manner, endeavouring to turn it out long, thick, and soft. Spread it carefully
on the dish prepared for it, and serve at once. This dish ought to be reserved for recherché
déjeûners, or for assemblies where amateurs meet who know how to eat well; washed down with
a good old wine, it will work wonders.

Note.--The roe and the tunny must be beaten up (sauté) without allowing them to boil, to prevent
their hardening, which would prevent them mixing well with the eggs. Your dish should be hollowed
towards the centre, to allow the gravy to concentrate, that it may be helped with a spoon.
The dish ought to be slightly heated, otherwise the cold china will extract all the heat from
the omelet.

CHAPTER XXX.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ICES, AND DESSERT DISHES.

PRESERVES.

1495. From the nature of vegetable substances, and chiefly from their not passing so rapidly
into the putrescent state as animal bodies, the mode of preserving them is somewhat different,
although the general principles are the same. All the means of preservation are put in practice
occasionally for fruits and the various parts of vegetables, according to the nature of the
species, the climate, the uses to which they are applied, &c. Some are dried, as nuts, raisins,
sweet herbs, &c.; others are preserved by means of sugar, such as many fruits whose delicate
juices would be lost by drying; some are preserved by means of vinegar, and chiefly used as
condiments or pickles; a few also by salting, as French beans; while others are preserved in
spirits. We have, however, in this place to treat of the best methods of preserving fruits.
Fruit is a most important item in the economy of health; the epicurean can scarcely be said
to have any luxuries without it; therefore, as it is so invaluable, when we cannot have it
fresh, we must have it preserved. It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some
cheap method, yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes, as making
tarts and other similar dishes. The expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection;
for, except the sugar is used in considerable quantities, the success is very uncertain. Sugar
also overpowers and destroys the sub-acid taste so desirable in many fruits: these which are
preserved in this manner are chiefly intended for the dessert. Fruits intended for preservation
should be gathered in the morning, in dry weather, with the morning sun upon them, if possible;
they will then have their fullest flavour, and keep in good condition longer than when gathered
at any other time. Until fruit can be used, it should be placed in the dairy, an ice-house,
or a refrigerator. In an icehouse it will remain fresh and plump for several days. Fruit gathered
in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed, and be of no service for preserves.

1496. Having secured the first and most important contribution to the manufacture of preserves,--the
fruit, the next consideration is the preparation of the syrup in which the fruit is to be suspended;
and this requires much care. In the confectioner's art there is a great nicety in proportioning
the degree of concentration of the syrup very exactly to each particular case; and they know
this by signs, and express it by certain technical terms. But to distinguish these properly
requires very great attention and considerable experience. The principal thing to be acquainted
with is the fact, that, in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled, its water will become
evaporated, and its consistency will be thicker. Great care must be taken in the management
of the fire, that the syrup does not boil over, and that the boiling is not carried to such
an extent as to burn the sugar.

1497. The first degree of consistency is called the thread, which is subdivided into the little
and great thread. If you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb, the tenacity
of the syrup will, on separating the finger and thumb, afford a thread, which shortly breaks:
this is the little thread. If the thread, from the greater tenacity, and, consequently, greater
strength of the syrup, admits of a greater extension of the finger and thumb, it is called
the great thread. There are half a dozen other terms and experiments for testing the various
thickness of the boiling sugar towards the consistency called caramel; but that degree of sugar-boiling
belongs to the confectioner. A solution of sugar prepared by dissolving two parts of double-refined
sugar (the best sugar is the most economical for preserves) in one of water, and boiling this
a little, affords a syrup of the right degree of strength, and which neither ferments nor crystallizes.
This appears to be the degree called smooth by the confectioners, and is proper to be used
for the purposes of preserves. The syrup employed should sometimes be clarified, which is done
in the following manner:--Dissolve 2 lbs. of loaf sugar in a pint of water; add to this solution
the white of an egg, and beat it well. Put the preserving-pan upon the fire with the solution;
stir it with a wooden spatula, and, when it begins to swell and boil up, throw in some cold
water or a little oil, to damp the boiling; for, as it rises suddenly, if it should boil over,
it would take fire, being of a very inflammable nature. Let it boil up again; then take it
off, and remove carefully the scum that has risen. Boil the solution again, throw in a little
more cold water, remove the scum, and so on for three or four times successively; then strain
it. It is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil.

1498. Although sugar passes so easily into the state of fermentation, and is, in fact, the
only substance capable of undergoing the vinous stage of that process, yet it will not ferment
at all if the quantity be sufficient to constitute a very strong syrup: hence, syrups are used
to preserve fruits and other vegetable substances from the changes they would undergo if left
to themselves. Before sugar was in use, honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions,
though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar-cane.

1499. The fruits that are the most fit for preservation in syrup are, apricots, peaches, nectarines,
apples, greengages, plums of all kinds, and pears. As an example, take some apricots not too
ripe, make a small slit at the stem end, and push out the stone; simmer them in water till
they are softened and about half done, and afterwards throw them into cold water. When they
have cooled, take them out and drain them. Put the apricots into the pie-serving-pan with sufficient
syrup to cover them; let them boil up three or four times, and then skim them; remove them
from the fire, pour them into an earthen pan, and let them cool till next day. Boil them up
three days successively, skimming each time, and they will then be finished and in a state
fit to be put into pots for use. After each bailing, it is proper to examine into the state
of the syrup when cold; if too thin, it will bear additional boiling; if too thick, it may
be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard. The reason why the fruit is emptied out of
the preserving-pan into an earthen pan is, that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper,
of which the preserving-pans are usually made. From this example the process of preserving
fruits by syrup will be easily comprehended. The first object is to soften the fruit by blanching
or boiling it in water, in order that the syrup by which it is preserved may penetrate through
its substance.

1500. Many fruits, when preserved by boiling, lose much of their peculiar and delicate flavour,
as, for instance, pine-apples; and this inconvenience may, in some instances, be remedied by
preserving them without heat. Cut the fruit in slices about one fifth of an inch thick, strew
powdered loaf sugar an eighth of an inch thick on the bottom of a jar, and put the slices on
it. Put more sugar on this, and then another layer of the slices, and so on till the jar is
full. Place the jar with the fruit up to the neck in boiling water, and keep it there till
the sugar is completely dissolved, which may take half an hour, removing the scum as it rises.
Lastly, tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar, or cork and wax it.

1501. Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves,
by first draining them from the syrup, and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven,
adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will gradually penetrate the fruit,
while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate. They should be dried in the stove or oven
on a sieve, and turned every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them
every time they are turned. Afterwards, they are to be kept in a dry situation, in drawers
or boxes. Currants and cherries preserved whole in this manner, in bunches, are extremely elegant,
and have a fine flavour. In this way it is, also, that orange and lemon chips are preserved.

1502. Marmalades, jams, and fruit pastes are of the same nature, and are now in very general
request. They are prepared without difficulty, by attending to a very few directions; they
are somewhat expensive, but may be kept without spoiling for a considerable time. Marmalades
and jams differ little from each other: they are preserves of a half-liquid consistency, made
by boiling the pulp of fruits, and sometimes part of the rinds, with sugar. The appellation
of marmalade is applied to those confitures which are composed of the firmer fruits, as pineapples
or the rinds of oranges; whereas jams are made of the more juicy berries, such as strawberries,
raspberries, currants, mulberries, &c. Fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades, consisting of
the pulp of fruits, first evaporated to a proper consistency, and afterwards boiled with sugar.
The mixture is then poured into a mould, or spread on sheets of tin, and subsequently dried
in the oven or stove till it has acquired the state of a paste. From a sheet of this paste,
strips may be cut and formed into any shape that may be desired, as knots, rings, &c. Jams
require the same care and attention in the boiling as marmalade; the slightest degree of burning
communicates a disagreeable empyreumatic taste, and if they are not boiled sufficiently, they
will not keep. That they may keep, it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar.

1503. In all the operations for preserve-making, when the preserving-pan is used, it should
not be placed on the fire, but on a trivet, unless the jam is made on a hot plate, when this
is not necessary. If the pan is placed close on to the fire, the preserve is very liable to
burn, and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled.

1504. Fruit jellies are compounds of the juices of fruits combined with sugar, concentrated,
by boiling, to such a consistency that the liquid, upon cooling, assumes the form of a tremulous
jelly.

1505. Before fruits are candied, they must first be boiled in syrup, after which they are taken
out and dried on a stove, or before the fire; the syrup is then to be concentrated, or boiled
to a candy height, and the fruit dipped in it, and again laid on the stove to dry and candy:
they are then to be put into boxes, and kept dry.

1506. Conserves consist of fresh vegetable matters beat into a uniform mass with refined sugar,
and they are intended to preserve the virtues and properties of recent flowers, leaves, roots,
peels, or fruits, unaltered, and as near as possible to what they were when fresh gathered,
and to give them an agreeable taste.

1507. The last-mentioned, but not the least-important preparation of fruit, is the compôte,
a confiture made at the moment of need, and with much less sugar than would be ordinarily put
to preserves. They are most wholesome things, suitable to most stomachs which cannot accommodate
themselves to raw fruit or a large portion of sugar: they are the happy medium, and far better
than ordinary stewed fruit.

CONFECTIONARY.

1508. In speaking of confectionary, it should be remarked that all the various preparations
above named come, strictly speaking, under that head; for the various fruits, flowers, herbs,
roots, and juices, which, when boiled with sugar, were formerly employed in pharmacy as well
as for sweetmeats, were called confections, from the Latin word conficere, 'to make up;' but
the term confectionary embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food, many kinds of which
should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine. The thousand and one ornamental dishes that
adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner: they cannot profitably
be made at home. Apart from these, cakes, biscuits, and tarts, &c., the class of sweetmeats
called confections may be thus classified:--1. Liquid confects, or fruits either whole or in
pieces, preserved by being immersed in a fluid transparent syrup; as the liquid confects of
apricots, green citrons, and many foreign fruits. 2. Dry confects are those which, after having
been boiled in the syrup, are taken out and put to dry in an oven, as citron and orange-peel,
&c. 3. Marmalade, jams, and pastes, a kind of soft compounds made of the pulp of fruits or
other vegetable substances, beat up with sugar or honey; such as oranges, apricots, pears,
&c. 4. Jellies are the juices of fruits boiled with sugar to a pretty thick consistency, so
as, upon cooling, to form a trembling jelly; as currant, gooseberry, apple jelly, &c. 5. Conserves
are a kind of dry confects, made by beating up flowers, fruits, &c., with sugar, not dissolved.
6. Candies are fruits candied over with sugar after having been boiled in the syrup.

DESSERT DISHES.

1509. With moderns the dessert is not so profuse, nor does it hold the same relationship to
the dinner that it held with the ancients,--the Romans more especially. On ivory tables they
would spread hundreds of different kinds of raw, cooked, and preserved fruits, tarts and cakes,
as substitutes for the more substantial comestibles with which the guests were satiated. However,
as late as the reigns of our two last Georges, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful
desserts. The dessert certainly repays, in its general effect, the expenditure upon it of much
pains; and it may be said, that if there be any poetry at all in meals, or the process of feeding,
there is poetry in the dessert, the materials for which should be selected with taste, and,
of course, must depend, in a great measure, upon the season. Pines, melons, grapes, peaches,
nectarines, plums, strawberries, apples, pears, oranges, almonds, raisins, figs, walnuts, filberts,
medlars, cherries, &c. &c., all kinds of dried fruits, and choice and delicately-flavoured
cakes and biscuits, make up the dessert, together with the most costly and recherché wines.
The shape of the dishes varies at different periods, the prevailing fashion at present being
oval and circular dishes on stems. The patterns and colours are also subject to changes of
fashion; some persons selecting china, chaste in pattern and colour; others, elegantly-shaped
glass dishes on stems, with gilt edges. The beauty of the dessert services at the tables of
the wealthy tends to enhance the splendour of the plate. The general mode of putting a dessert
on table, now the elegant tazzas are fashionable, is, to place them down the middle of the
table, a tall and short dish alternately; the fresh fruits being arranged on the tall dishes,
and dried fruits, bon-bons, &c., on small round or oval glass plates. The garnishing needs
especial attention, as the contrast of the brilliant-coloured fruits with nicely-arranged foliage
is very charming. The garnish par excellence for dessert is the ice-plant; its crystallized
dewdrops producing a marvellous effect in the height of summer, giving a most inviting sense
of coolness to the fruit it encircles. The double-edged mallow, strawberry, and vine leaves
have a pleasing effect; and for winter desserts, the bay, cuba, and laurel are sometimes used.
In town, the expense and difficulty of obtaining natural foliage is great, but paper and composite
leaves are to be purchased at an almost nominal price. Mixed fruits of the larger sort are
now frequently served on one dish. This mode admits of the display of much taste in the arrangement
of the fruit: for instance, a pine in the centre of the dish, surrounded with large plums of
various sorts and colours, mixed with pears, rosy-cheeked apples, all arranged with a due regard
to colour, have a very good effect. Again, apples and pears look well mingled with plums and
grapes, hanging from the border of the dish in a négligé sort of manner, with a large bunch
of the same fruit lying on the top of the apples. A dessert would not now be considered complete
without candied and preserved fruits and confections. The candied fruits may be purchased at
a less cost than they can be manufactured at home. They are preserved abroad in most ornamental
and elegant forms. And since, from the facilities of travel, we have become so familiar with
the tables of the French, chocolate in different forms is indispensable to our desserts.

ICES.

510. Ices are composed, it is scarcely necessary to say, of congealed cream or water, combined
sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingredients, or more generally with the juices
of fruits. At desserts, or at some evening parties, ices are scarcely to be dispensed with.
The principal utensils required for making ice-creams are ice-tubs, freezing-pots, spaddles,
and a cellaret. The tub must be large enough to contain about a bushel of ice, pounded small,
when brought out of the ice-house, and mixed very carefully with either salt, nitre, or soda.
The freezing-pot is best made of pewter. If it be of tin, as is sometimes the case, the congelation
goes on too rapidly in it for the thorough intermingling of its contents, on which the excellence
of the ice greatly depends. The spaddle is generally made of copper, kept bright and clean.
The cellaret is a tin vessel, in which ices are kept for a short time from dissolving. The
method to be pursued in the freezing process must be attended to. When the ice-tub is prepared
with fresh-pounded ice and salt, the freezing-pot is put into it up to its cover. The articles
to be congealed are then poured into it and covered over; but to prevent the ingredients from
separating and the heaviest of them from falling to the bottom of the mould, it is requisite
to turn the freezing-pot round and round by the handle, so as to keep its contents moving until
the congelation commences. As soon as this is perceived (the cover of the pot being occasionally
taken off for the purpose of noticing when freezing takes place), the cover is immediately
closed over it, ice is put upon it, and it is left in this state till it is served. The use
of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing pot the cream, which
in the shaking may have washed against it, and by stirring it in with the rest, to prevent
waste of it occurring. Any negligence in stirring the contents of the freezing-pot before congelation
takes place, will destroy the whole: either the sugar sinks to the bottom and leaves the ice
insufficiently sweetened, or lumps are formed, which disfigure and discolour it.

1511. The aged, the delicate, and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages; even
the strong and healthy should partake of them in moderation. They should be taken immediately
after the repast, or some hours after, because the taking these substances during the process
of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition. It is necessary, then, that this function should
have scarcely commenced, or that it should be completely finished, before partaking of ices.
It is also necessary to abstain from them when persons are very warm, or immediately after
taking violent exercise, as in some cases they have produced illnesses which have ended fatally.

[Do ladies know to whom they are indebted for the introduction of ices, which all the fair
sex are passionately fond of?--To Catherine de' Medici. Will not this fact cover a multitude
of sins committed by the instigator of St. Bartholomew ?]

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXXI.

TO MAKE SYRUP FOR COMPOTES, &c.

1512. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1-1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/4 hour, carefully removing the scum as it rises:
the syrup is then ready for the fruit. The articles boiled in this syrup will not keep for
any length of time, it being suitable only for dishes intended to be eaten immediately. A larger
proportion of sugar must be added for a syrup intended to keep.

Time.--1/4 hour.

TO CLARIFY SUGAR OR SYRUP.

1513. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1/2 pint of water and 1/2 the white of an egg.

Mode.--Put the sugar, water, and the white of the egg, which should, be well beaten, into a
preserving-pan or lined saucepan; and do not put it on the fire till the sugar is dissolved.
Then place it on the fire, and when it boils, throw in a teacupful of cold water, and do not
stir the sugar after this is added. Bring it to the boiling-point again, and then place the
pan by the side of the fire, for the preparation to settle. Remove all the scum, and the sugar
will be ready for use. The scum should be placed on a sieve, so that what syrup runs from it
may be boiled up again: this must also be well skimmed.

Time.--20 minutes for the sugar to dissolve; 5 minutes to boil.

Note.--The above two recipes are those used in the preparation of dishes usually made at home.
There are many degrees of boiling sugar, which process requires great care, attention, and
experience. Caramel sugar, which makes an elegant cover for sweetmeats, is difficult to prepare,
and is best left to an experienced confectioner. We give the recipe, for those of our readers
who care to attempt the operation.

TO BOIL SUGAR TO CARAMEL.

1514. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of lump sugar allow 1 gill of spring water.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water together very quickly over a clear fire, skimming it very carefully
as soon as it boils. Keep it boiling until the sugar snaps when a little of it is dropped in
a pan of cold water. If it remains hard, the sugar has attained the right degree; then squeeze
in a little lemon-juice, and let it remain an instant on the fire. Set the pan into another
of cold water, and the caramel is then ready for use. The insides of well-oiled moulds are
often ornamented with this sugar, which with a fork should be spread over them in fine threads
or network. A dish of light pastry, tastefully arranged, looks very prettily with this sugar
spun lightly over it. The sugar must be carefully watched, and taken up the instant it is done.
Unless the cook is very experienced and thoroughly understands her business, it is scarcely
worth while to attempt to make this elaborate ornament, as it may be purchased quite as economically
at a confectioner's, if the failures in the preparation are taken into consideration.

COMPOTE OF APPLES.

(Soyer's Recipe,--a Dessert Dish.)

1515. INGREDIENTS.--6 ripe apples, 1 lemon, 1/2 lb. of lump sugar, 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Select the apples of a moderate size, peel them, cut them in halves, remove the cores,
and rub each piece over with a little lemon. Put the sugar and water together into a lined
saucepan, and let them boil until forming a thickish syrup, when lay in the apples with the
rind of the lemon cut thin, and the juice of the same. Let the apples simmer till tender; then
take them out very carefully, drain them on a sieve, and reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly
for a few minutes. When both are cold, arrange the apples neatly on a glass dish, pour over
the syrup, and garnish with strips of green angelica or candied citron. Smaller apples may
be dressed in the same manner: they should not be divided in half, but peeled and the cores
pushed out with a vegetable-cutter.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the sugar and water together; from 15 to 25 minutes to simmer the apples.

APPLE GINGER.

(A Dessert Dish.)

1516 INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of any kind of hard apples, 2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 1-1/2 pint of water,
1 oz. of tincture of ginger.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water until they form a rich syrup, adding the ginger when it boils
up. Pare, core, and cut the apples into pieces; dip them in cold water to preserve the colour,
and boil them in the syrup until transparent; but be careful not to let them break. Put the
pieces of apple into jars, pour over the syrup, and carefully exclude the air, by well covering
them. It will remain good some time, if kept in a dry place.

Time.--From 5 to 10 minutes to boil the syrup; about 1/2 hour to simmer the apples.

APPLE JAM.

1517. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit weighed after being pared, cored, and sliced, allow
3/4 lb. of preserving-sugar, the grated rind of 1 lemon, the juice of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Peel the apples, core and slice them very thin, and be particular that they are all
the same sort. Put them into a jar, stand this in a saucepan of boiling water, and let the
apples stew until quite tender. Previously to putting the fruit into the jar, weigh it, to
ascertain the proportion of sugar that may be required. Put the apples into a preserving-pan,
crush the sugar to small lumps, and add it, with the grated lemon-rind and juice, to the apples.
Simmer these over the fire for 1/2 hour, reckoning from the time the jam begins to simmer properly;
remove the scum as it rises, and when the jam is done, put it into pots for use. Place a piece
of oiled paper over the jam, and to exclude the air, cover the pots with tissue-paper dipped
in the white of an egg, and stretched over the top. This jam will keep good for a long time.

Time.--About 2 hours to stew in the jar; 1/2 hour to boil after the jam begins to simmer.

Average cost, for this quantity, 6s.

Sufficient.--7 or 8 lbs. of apples for 6 pots of jam.

Seasonable.--Make this in September, October, or November.

APPLE JELLY.

I.

1518. Place them in a cool oven, with the jar well covered, and when the juice is thoroughly
drawn and the apples are quite soft, strain them through a jelly-bag. To every quart of juice
allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar, which should be crushed to small lumps, and put into a preserving-pan
with the juice. Boil these together for rather more than 1/2 hour, remove the scum as it rises,
add the lemon-juice just before it is done, and put the jelly into pots for use. This preparation
is useful for garnishing sweet dishes, and may be turned out for dessert.

Time.--The apples to be put in the oven over-night, and left till morning; rather more than
1/2 hour to boil the jelly.

Average cost, for this quantity, 3s.

Sufficient for 6 small pots of jelly.

Seasonable,--This should be made in September, October, or November.

II.

1519. INGREDIENTS.--Apples, water: to every pint of syrup allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Pare and cut the apples into pieces, remove the cores, and put them in a preserving-pan
with sufficient cold water to cover them. Let them boil for an hour; then drain the syrup from
them through a hair sieve or jelly-bag, and measure the juice; to every pint allow 3/4 lb.
of loaf sugar, and boil these together for 3/4 hour, removing every particle of scum as it
rises, and keeping the jelly well stirred, that it may not burn. A little lemon-rind may be
boiled with the apples, and a small quantity of strained lemon-juice may be put in the jelly
just before it is done, when the flavour is liked. This jelly may be ornamented with preserved
greengages, or any other preserved fruit, and will turn out very prettily for dessert. It should
be stored away in small pots.

Time.--1 hour to boil the fruit and water; 3/4 hour to boil the juice with the sugar.

Average cost, for 6 lbs. of apples, with the other ingredients in proportion, 3s.

Sufficient for 6 small pots of jelly.

Seasonable.--Make this in September, October, or November.

TO PRESERVE APPLES IN QUARTERS, in imitation of Ginger.

1520. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of apples allow 3/4 lb. of sugar, 1-1/2 oz. of the best white
ginger; 1 oz. of ginger to every 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Peel, core, and quarter the apples, and put the fruit, sugar, and ginger in layers into
a wide-mouthed jar, and let them remain for 2 days; then infuse 1 oz. of ginger in 1/2 pint
of boiling water, and cover it closely, and let it remain for 1 day: this quantity of ginger
and water is for 3 lbs. of apples, with the other ingredients in proportion. Put the apples,
&c., into a preserving-pan with the water strained from the ginger, and boil till the apples
look clear and the syrup is rich, which will be in about an hour. The rind of a lemon may be
added just before the apples have finished boiling; and great care must be taken not to break
the pieces of apple in putting them into the jars. Serve on glass dishes for dessert.

Time.--2 days for the apples to remain in the jar with sugar, &c.; 1 day to infuse the ginger;
about 1 hour to boil the apples.

Average cost, for 3 lbs. of apples, with the other ingredients in proportion, 2s. 3d.

Sufficient.--3 lbs. should fill 3 moderate-sized jars.

Seasonable.--This should be made in September, October, or November.

COMPOTE OF APRICOTS.

(An elegant Dish.)

1521. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of syrup No. 1512, 12 green apricots.

Mode.--Make the syrup by recipe No. 1512, and when it is ready, put in the apricots whilst
the syrup is boiling. Simmer them very gently until tender, taking care not to let them break;
take them out carefully, arrange them on a glass dish, let the syrup cool a little, pour it
over the apricots, and, when cold, serve.

Time.--From 15 to 20 minutes to simmer the apricots.

APRICOT JAM or MARMALADE.

1522. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of ripe apricots, weighed after being skinned and stoned,
allow 1 lb. of sugar.

Mode.--Pare the apricots, which should be ripe, as thinly as possible, break them in half,
and remove the stones. Weigh the fruit, and to every lb. allow the same proportion of loaf
sugar. Pound the sugar very finely in a mortar, strew it over the apricots, which should be
placed on dishes, and let them remain for 12 hours. Break the stones, blanch the kernels, and
put them with the sugar and fruit into a preserving-pan. Let these simmer very gently until
clear; take out the pieces of apricot singly as they become so, and, as fast as the scum rises,
carefully remove it. Put the apricots into small jars, pour over them the syrup and kernels,
cover the jam with pieces of paper dipped in the purest salad-oil, and stretch over the top
of the jars tissue-paper, cut about 2 inches larger and brushed over with the white of an egg:
when dry, it will be perfectly hard and air-tight.

Time.--12 hours sprinkled with sugar; about 3/4 hour to boil the jam.

Average cost.--When cheap, apricots may be purchased for preserving at about 1s. 6d. per gallon.

Sufficient,--10 lbs. of fruit for 12 pots of jam.

Seasonable.--Make this in August or September.

BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES.

1523. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1513, barberries.

Mode.--Prepare some small pieces of clean white wood, 3 inches long and 1/4 inch wide, and
tie the fruit on to these in nice bunches. Have ready some clear syrup, made by recipe No.
1513; put in the barberries, and simmer them in it for 2 successive days, boiling them for
nearly 1/2 hour each day, and covering them each time with the syrup when cold. When the fruit
looks perfectly clear, it is sufficiently done, and should be stored away in pots, with the
syrup poured over, or the fruit may be candied.

Time.--1/2 hour to simmer each day.

Seasonable in autumn.

Note.--The berries in their natural state make a very pretty garnishing for dishes, and may
even be used for the same purpose, preserved as above, and look exceedingly nice on sweet dishes.

TO MAKE BARLEY-SUGAR.

1524. When it boils, remove the scum as it rises, and keep it boiling until no more appears,
and the syrup looks perfectly clear; then strain it through a fine sieve or muslin bag, and
put it back into the saucepan. Boil it again like caramel, until it is brittle, when a little
is dropped in a basin of cold water: it is then sufficiently boiled. Add a little lemon-juice
and a few drops of essence of lemon, and let it stand for a minute or two. Have ready a marble
slab or large dish, rubbed over with salad-oil; pour on it the sugar, and cut it into strips
with a pair of scissors: these strips should then be twisted, and the barley-sugar stored away
in a very dry place. It may be formed into lozenges or drops, by dropping the sugar in a very
small quantity at a time on to the oiled slab or dish.

CARROT JAM TO IMITATE APRICOT PRESERVE.

1525. INGREDIENTS.--Carrots; to every lb. of carrot pulp allow 1 lb. of pounded sugar, the
grated rind of 1 lemon, the strained juice of 2, 6 chopped bitter almonds, 2 tablespoonfuls
of brandy.

Mode.--Select young carrots; wash and scrape them clean, cut them into round pieces, put them
into a saucepan with sufficient water to cover them, and let them simmer until perfectly soft;
then beat them through a sieve. Weigh the pulp, and to every lb. allow the above ingredients.
Put the pulp into a preserving-pan with the sugar, and let this boil for 5 minutes, stirring
and skimming all the time. When cold, add the lemon-rind and juice, almonds and brandy; mix
these well with the jam; then put it into pots, which must be well covered and kept in a dry
place. The brandy may be omitted, but the preserve will then not keep: with the brandy it will
remain good for months.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to boil the carrots; 5 minutes to simmer the pulp.

Average cost, 1s. 2d. for 1 lb. of pulp, with the other ingredients in proportion.

Sufficient to fill 3 pots.

Seasonable from July to December.

TO MAKE CHERRY BRANDY.

1536. INGREDIENTS.--Morella cherries, good brandy; to every lb. of cherries allow 3 oz. of
pounded sugar.

Mode.--Have ready some glass bottles, which must be perfectly dry. Ascertain that the cherries
are not too ripe and are freshly gathered, and cut off about half of the stalks. Put them into
the bottles, with the above proportion of sugar to every lb. of fruit; strew this in between
the cherries, and, when the bottles are nearly full, pour in sufficient brandy to reach just
below the cork. A few peach or apricot kernels will add much to their flavour, or a few blanched
bitter almonds. Put corks or bungs into the bottles, tie over them a piece of bladder, and
store away in a dry place. The cherries will be fit to eat in 2 or 3 months, and will remain
good for years. They are liable to shrivel and become tough if too much sugar be added to them.

Average cost, 1s. to 1s. 6d. per lb.

Sufficient.--1 lb. of cherries and about 1/4 pint of brandy for a quart bottle. Seasonable
in August and September.

DRIED CHERRIES.

1527. CHERRIES may be put in a slow oven and thoroughly dried before they begin to change colour.
They should then be taken out of the oven, tied in bunches, and stored away in a dry place.
In the winter, they may be cooked with sugar for dessert, the same as Normandy pippins. Particular
care must be taken that the oven be not too hot. Another method of drying cherries is to stone
them, and to put them into a preserving-pan, with plenty of loaf sugar strewed amongst them.
They should be simmered till the fruit shrivels, when they should be strained from the juice.
The cherries should then be placed in an oven, cool enough to dry without baking them. About
5 oz. of sugar would be required for 1 lb. of cherries, and the same syrup may be used again
to do another quantity of fruit.

CHERRY JAM.

1528. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit, weighed before stoning, allow 1/2 lb. of sugar;
to every 6 lbs. of fruit allow 1 pint of red-currant juice, and to every pint of juice 1 lb.
of sugar.

Mode.--Weigh the fruit before stoning, and allow half the weight of sugar; stone the cherries,
and boil them in a preserving-pan until nearly all the juice is dried up; then add the sugar,
which should be crushed to powder, and the currant-juice, allowing 1 pint to every 6 lbs. of
cherries (original weight), and 1 lb. of sugar to every pint of juice. Boil all together until
it jellies, which will be in from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; skim the jam well, keep it well stirred,
and, a few minutes before it is done, crack some of the stones, and add the kernels: these
impart a very delicious flavour to the jam.

Time.--According to the quality of the cherries, from 3/4 to 1 hour to boil them; 20 minutes
to 1/2 hour with the sugar.

Average cost, from 7d. to 8d. per lb. pot.

Sufficient.--1 pint of fruit for a lb. pot of jam.

Seasonable.--Make this in July or August.

TO PRESERVE CHERRIES IN SYRUP.

(Very delicious.)

1529. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of cherries, 3 lbs. of sugar, 1 pint of white-currant juice.

Mode.--Let the cherries be as clear and as transparent as possible, and perfectly ripe; pick
off the stalks, and remove the stones, damaging the fruit as little as you can. Make a syrup
with the above proportion of sugar, by recipe No. 1512; mix the cherries with it, and boil
them for about 15 minutes, carefully skimming them; turn them gently into a pan, and let them
remain till the next day; then drain the cherries on a sieve, and put the syrup and white-currant
juice into the preserving-pan again. Boil these together until the syrup is somewhat reduced
and rather thick; then put in the cherries, and let them boil for about 5 minutes; take them
off the fire, skim the syrup, put the cherries into small pots or wide-mouthed bottles; pour
the syrup over, and when quite cold, tie them down carefully, so that the air is quite excluded.

Time.--15 minutes to boil the cherries in the syrup; 10 minutes to boil the syrup and currant-juice;
6 minutes to boil the cherries the second time.

Average cost for this quantity, 3s. 6d.

Seasonable.--Make this in July or August.

BLACK-CURRANT JAM.

1530. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit, weighed before being stripped from the stalks, allow
3/4 lb. of loaf sugar, 1 gill of water.

Mode.--Let the fruit be very ripe, and gathered on a dry day. Strip it from the stalks, and
put it into a preserving-pan, with a gill of water to each lb. of fruit; boil these together
for 10 minutes; then add the sugar, and boil the jam again for 30 minutes, reckoning from the
time when the jam simmers equally all over, or longer, should it not appear to set nicely when
a little is poured on to a plate. Keep stirring it to prevent it from burning, carefully remove
all the scum, and when done, pour it into pots. Let it cool, cover the top of the jam with
oiled paper, and the top of the jars with a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides
with the white of an egg: this, when cold, forms a hard stiff cover, and perfectly excludes
the air. Great attention must be paid to the stirring of this jam, as it is very liable to
burn, on account of the thickness of the juice.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the fruit and water; 30 minutes with the sugar, or longer.

Average cost, from 6d. to 8d. for a pot capable of holding 1 lb.

Sufficient.--Allow from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 1 dozen pots of jam, each pot to
hold 1 lb.

Seasonable.--Make this in July.

BLACK-CURRANT JELLY.

1531. INGREDIENTS.--Black currants; to every pint of juice allow 1/4 pint of water, 1 lb. of
loaf sugar.

Mode.--Strip the currants from the stalks, which may be done in an expeditious manner, by holding
the bunch in one hand, and passing a small silver fork down the currants: they will then readily
fall from the stalks. Put them into a jar, place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and
simmer them until their juice is extracted; then strain them, and to every pint of juice allow
the above proportion of sugar and water; stir these ingredients together cold until the sugar
is dissolved; place the preserving-pan on the fire, and boil the jelly for about 1/2 hour,
reckoning from the time it commences to boil all over, and carefully remove the scum as it
rises. If the jelly becomes firm when a little is put on a plate, it is done; it should then
be put into small pots, and covered the same as the jam in the preceding recipe. If the jelly
is wanted very clear, the fruit should not be squeezed dry; but, of course, so much juice will
not be obtained. If the fruit is not much squeezed, it may be converted into a jam for immediate
eating, by boiling it with a little common sugar: this answers very well for a nursery preserve.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to extract the juice; 1/2 hour to boil the jelly.

Average cost, from 8d. to 10d. per 1/2-lb. pot.

Sufficient.--From 3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield a pint of juice.

Seasonable.--Make this in July.

RED-CURRANT JAM.

1532. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Let the fruit be gathered on a fine day; weigh it, and then strip the currants from
the stalks; put them into a preserving-pan with sugar in the above proportion; stir them, and
boil them for about 3/4 hour. Carefully remove the scum as it rises. Put the jam into pots,
and, when cold, cover with oiled papers; over these put a piece of tissue-paper brushed over
on both sides with the white of an egg; press the paper round the top of the pot, and, when
dry, the covering will be quite hard and air-tight.

Time.--1/2 to 3/4 hour, reckoning from the time the jam boils all over.

Average cost, for a lb. pot, from 6d. to 8d.

Sufficient.--Allow from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 12 1-lb, pots of jam.

Seasonable.--Make this in July.

RED-CURRANT JELLY.

1533. Take it off the fire, pour it into small gallipots, cover each of the pots with an oiled
paper, and then with a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an
egg. Label the pots, adding the year when the jelly was made, and store it away in a dry place.
A jam may be made with the currants, if they are not squeezed too dry, by adding a few fresh
raspberries, and boiling all together, with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely. As this
preserve is not worth storing away, but is only for immediate eating, a smaller proportion
of sugar than usual will be found enough: it answers very well for children's puddings, or
for a nursery preserve. Seasonable.--Make this in July. Note.--Should the above proportion
of sugar not be found sufficient for some tastes, add an extra 1/4 lb. to every pint of juice,
making altogether 1 lb.

WHITE-CURRANT JELLY.

1534. INGREDIENTS.--White currants; to every pint of juice allow 3/4 lb. of good loaf sugar.
Then strain the currants through a fine cloth or jelly-bag; do not squeeze them too much, or
the jelly will not be clear, and put the juice into a very clean preserving-pan, with the sugar.
Let this simmer gently over a clear fire until it is firm, and keep stirring and skimming until
it is done; then pour it into small pots, cover them, and store away in a dry place.

Seasonable in July and August.

BAKED DAMSONS FOR WINTER USE.

1535. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 6 oz. of pounded sugar; melted mutton suet.

Mode.--Choose sound fruit, not too ripe; pick off the stalks, weigh it, and to every lb. allow
the above proportion of pounded sugar. Put the fruit into large dry stone jars, sprinkling
the sugar amongst it; cover the jars with saucers, place them in a rather cool oven, and bake
the fruit until it is quite tender. When cold, cover the top of the fruit with a piece of white
paper cut to the size of the jar; pour over this melted mutton suet about an inch thick, and
cover the tops of the jars with thick brown paper, well tied down. Keep the jars in a cool
dry place, and the fruit will remain good till the following Christmas, but not much longer.

Time.--From 5 to 6 hours to bake the damsons, in a very cool oven.

Seasonable in September and October.

DAMSON CHEESE.

1536. INGREDIENTS.--Damsons; to every lb. of fruit pulp allow 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Pick the stalks from the damsons, and put them into a preserving-pan; simmer them over
the fire until they are soft, occasionally stirring them; then beat them through a coarse sieve,
and put the pulp and juice into the preserving-pan, with sugar in the above proportion, having
previously carefully weighed them. Stir the sugar well in, and simmer the damsons slowly for
2 hours. Skim well; then boil the preserve quickly for 1/2 hour, or until it looks firm and
hard in the spoon; put it quickly into shallow pots, or very tiny earthenware moulds, and,
when cold, cover it with oiled papers, and the jars with tissue-paper brushed over on both
sides with the white of an egg. A few of the stones may be cracked, and the kernels boiled
with the damsons, which very much improves the flavour of the cheese.

Time.--1 hour to boil the damsons without the sugar; 2 hours to simmer them slowly, 1/2 hour
quickly.

Average cost, from 8d. to 10d. per 1/3 lb. pot.

Sufficient.--1 pint of damsons to make a very small pot of cheese.

Seasonable.--Make this in September or October.

COMPOTE OF DAMSONS.

1537. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of damsons, 1 pint of syrup No. 1512.

Mode.--Procure sound ripe damsons; pick the stalks from them, and put them into boiling syrup,
made by recipe No. 1512. Simmer them gently until the fruit is tender, but not sufficiently
soft to break; take them up, boil the syrup for 5 minutes; pour it over the damsons, and serve.
This should be sent to table in a glass dish.

Time.--About 1/4 hour to simmer the damsons; 5 minutes to boil the syrup.

DAMSON JAM.

1538. Stone the damsons, weigh them, and to every lb. allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar. Put the
fruit and sugar into a preserving-pan; keep stirring them gently until the sugar is dissolved,
and carefully remove the scum as it rises. Boil the jam for about an hour, reckoning from the
time it commences to simmer all over alike: it must be well stirred all the time, or it will
be liable to burn and stick to the pan, which will cause the jam to have a very disagreeable
flavour. When the jam looks firm, and the juice appears to set, it is done. Then take it off
the fire, put into pots, cover it down, when quite cold, with oiled and egged papers, the same
as in recipe No. 1530, and store it away in a dry place.

Time.--1 hour after the jam simmers all over.

Average cost, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.

Sufficient.--1-1/2 pint of damsons for a lb. pot.

Seasonable.--Make this in September or October.

A VERY NICE PRESERVE OF DAMSONS.

1539. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of damsons allow 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Put the damsons (which should be picked from the stalks and quite free from blemishes)
into a jar, with pounded sugar sprinkled amongst them in the above proportion; tie the jar
closely down, set it in a saucepan of cold water; bring it gradually to boil, and simmer gently
until the damsons are soft, without being broken. Let them stand till cold; then strain the
juice from them, boil it up well, strain it through a jelly-bag, and pour it over the fruit.

Time.--About 3/4 hour to simmer the fruit after the water boils; 1/4 hour to boil the juice.

Seasonable.--Make this in September or October.

TO PRESERVE DAMSONS, OR ANY KIND OF PLUMS.

(Useful in Winter.)

1540. INGREDIENTS.--Damsons or plums; boiling water.

Mode.--Pick the fruit into clean dry stone jars, taking care to leave out all that are broken
or blemished. When full, pour boiling water on the plums, until it stands one inch above the
fruit; cut a piece of paper to fit the inside of the jar, over which pour melted mutton-suet;
cover down with brown paper, and keep the jars in a dry cool place. When used, the suet should
be removed, the water poured off, and the jelly at the bottom of the jar used and mixed with
the fruit.

Seasonable in September and October.

COMPOTE OF GREEN FIGS.

1541. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1512, 1-1/2 pint of green figs, the rind of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Make a syrup by recipe No. 1512, boiling with it the lemon-rind, and carefully remove
all the scum as it rises. Put in the figs, and simmer them very slowly until tender; dish them
on a glass dish; reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly for 5 minutes; take out the lemon-peel,
pour the syrup over the figs, and the compote, when cold, will be ready for table. A little
port wine, or lemon-juice, added just before the figs are done, will be found an improvement.

Time.--2 to 3 hours to stew the figs.

Average cost, figs, 2s. to 3s. per dozen.

Seasonable in August and September.

TO BOTTLE FRESH FRUIT.

(Very useful in Winter.)

I.

1542. INGREDIENTS.--Fresh fruits, such as currants, raspberries, cherries, gooseberries, plums
of all kinds, damsons, &c.; wide-mouthed glass bottles, new corks to fit them tightly.

Mode.--Let the fruit be full grown, but not too ripe, and gathered in dry weather. Pick it
off the stalks without bruising or breaking the skin, and reject any that is at all blemished:
if gathered in the damp, or if the skins are cut at all, the fruit will mould. Have ready some
perfectly dry glass bottles, and some nice new soft corks or bungs; burn a match in each bottle,
to exhaust the air, and quickly place the fruit in to be preserved; gently cork the bottles,
and put them into a very cool oven, where let them remain until the fruit has shrunk away a
fourth part. Then take the bottles out; do not open them, but immediately beat the corks in
tight, cut off the tops, and cover them with melted resin. If kept in a dry place, the fruit
will remain good for months; and on this principally depends the success of the preparation;
for if stored away in a place that is in the least damp, the fruit will soon spoil.

Time.--From 5 to 6 hours in a very slow oven.

II.

1543. Let it be carefully picked and put into the bottles, which must be clean and perfectly
dry. Tie over the tops of the bottles pieces of bladder; stand the bottles in a large pot,
copper, or boiler, with cold water to reach to their necks; kindle a fire under, let the water
boil, and as the bladders begin to rise and puff, prick them. As soon as the water boils, extinguish
the fire, and let the bottles remain where they are, to become cold. The next day remove the
bladders, and strew over the fruit a thick layer of pounded sugar; fit the bottles with corks,
and let each cork lie close at hand to its own bottle. Hold for a few moments, in the neck
of the bottle, two or three lighted matches, and when they have filled the bottle neck with
gas, and before they go out, remove them very quickly; instantly cork the bottle closely, and
dip it in bottle cement.

Time.--Altogether about 8 hours.

TO BOTTLE FRESH FRUIT WITH SUGAR.

(Very useful in Winter.)

1544. INGREDIENTS.--Any kind of fresh fruit; to each quart bottle allow 1/4 lb. of pounded sugar.

Mode.--Let the fruit be gathered in dry weather. Pick it carefully, and drop it into clean
and very dry quart glass bottles, sprinkling over it the above proportion of pounded sugar
to each quart. Put the corks in the bottles, and place them in a copper of cold water up to
their necks, with small hay-wisps round them, to prevent the bottles from knocking together.
Light the fire under, bring the water gradually to boil, and let it simmer gently until the
fruit in the bottles is reduced nearly one third. Extinguish the fire, and let the bottles
remain in the water until it is perfectly cold; then take them out, make the corks secure,
and cover them with melted resin or wax.

Time.--About 1 hour from the time the water commences to boil.

TO FROST HOLLY-LEAVES, for garnishing and decorating Dessert and Supper Dishes.

1545.--INGREDIENTS.--Sprigs of holly, oiled butter, coarsely-powdered sugar.

Mode.--Procure some nice sprigs of holly; pick the leaves from the stalks, and wipe them with
a clean cloth free from all moisture; then place them on a dish near the fire, to get thoroughly
dry, but not too near to shrivel the leaves; dip them into oiled butter, sprinkle over them
some coarsely-powdered sugar, and dry them before the fire. They should be kept in a dry place,
as the least damp would spoil their appearance.

Time.--About 10 minutes to dry before the fire.

Seasonable.--These may be made at any time; but are more suitable for winter garnishes, when
fresh flowers are not easily obtained.

COMPOTE OF GOOSEBERRIES.

1546. INGREDIENTS.--Syrup made by recipe No. 1512; to 1 pint of syrup allow nearly a quart
of gooseberries.

Mode.--Top and tail the gooseberries, which should not be very ripe, and pour over them some
boiling water; then take them out, and plunge them into cold water, with which has been mixed
a tablespoonful of vinegar, which will assist to keep the fruit a good colour. Make a pint
of syrup by recipe No. 1512, and when it boils, drain the gooseberries and put them in; simmer
them gently until the fruit is nicely pulped and tender, without being broken; then dish the
gooseberries on a glass dish, boil the syrup for 2 or 3 minutes, pour over the gooseberries,
and serve cold.

Time.--About 5 minutes to boil the gooseberries in the syrup; 3 minutes to reduce the syrup.

Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient,--a quart of gooseberries for 5 or 6 persons.

Seasonable in June.

GOOSEBERRY JAM.

I.

1547.

Mode.--Select red hairy gooseberries; have them gathered in dry weather, when quite ripe, without
being too soft. Weigh them; with a pair of scissors, cut off the tops and tails, and to every
6 lbs. of fruit have ready 1/2 pint of red-currant juice, drawn as for jelly. Put the gooseberries
and currant-juice into a preserving-pan; let them boil tolerably quickly, keeping them well
stirred; when they begin to break, add to them the sugar, and keep simmering until the jam
becomes firm, carefully skimming: and stirring it, that it does not burn at the bottom. It
should be boiled rather a long time, or it will not keep. Put it into pots (not too large);
let it get perfectly cold; then cover the pots down with oiled and egged papers, as directed
for red-currant jelly No. 1533.

Time.--About 1 hour to boil the gooseberries in the currant-juice; from 1/2 to 3/4 hour with
the sugar.

Average cost, per lb. pot, from 6d. to 8d.

Sufficient.--Allow 1-1/2 pint of fruit for a lb. pot.

Seasonable.--Make this in June or July.

II.

1548. INGREDIENTS.--To every 8 lbs. of red, rough, ripe gooseberries allow 1 quart of red-currant
juice, 5 lbs. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Have the fruit gathered in dry weather, and cut off the tops and tails. Prepare 1 quart
of red-currant juice, the same as for red-currant jelly No. 1533; put it into a preserving-pan
with the sugar, and keep stirring until the latter is dissolved. Keep it boiling for about
5 minutes; skim well; then put in the gooseberries, and let them boil from 1/2 to 3/4 hour;
then turn the whole into an earthen pan, and let it remain for 2 days. Care must be taken,
in making this, to keep the jam well stirred and well skimmed, to prevent it burning at the
bottom of the pan, and to have it very clear.

Time.--5 minutes to boil the currant-juice and sugar after the latter is dissolved; from 1/2
to 3/4 hour to simmer the gooseberries the first time, 1/4 hour the second time of boiling.

Average cost, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. pot.

WHITE OR GREEN GOOSEBERRY JAM.

1549. INGREDIENTS.--Equal weight of fruit and sugar.

Mode.--Select the gooseberries not very ripe, either white or green, and top and tail them.
Boil the sugar with water (allowing 1/2 pint to every lb.) for about 1/4 hour, carefully removing
the scum as it rises; then put in the gooseberries, and simmer gently till clear and firm:
try a little of the jam on a plate; if it jellies when cold, it is done, and should then be
poured into pots. When cold, cover with oiled paper, and tissue-paper brushed over on both
sides with the unbeaten white of an egg, and store away in a dry place.

Time.--1/4 hour to boil the sugar and water, 3/4 hour the jam.

GOOSEBERRY JELLY.

1550. Boil the juice and sugar together for nearly 3/4 hour, stirring and skimming all the
time; and if the jelly appears firm when a little of it is poured on to a plate, it is done,
and should then be taken up and put into small pots. Cover the pots with oiled and egged papers,
the same as for currant jelly No. 1533, and store away in a dry place.

Time.--3/4 hour to simmer the gooseberries without the sugar; 3/4 hour to boil the juice.

Seasonable in July.

COMPOTE OF GREENGAGES.

1551. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup made by recipe No. 1512, 1 quart of greengages.

Mode.--Make a syrup by recipe No. 1512, skim it well, and put in the greengages when the syrup
is boiling, having previously removed the stalks and stones from the fruit. Boil gently for
1/4 hour, or until the fruit is tender; but take care not to let it break, as the appearance
of the dish would be spoiled were the fruit reduced to a pulp. Take the greengages carefully
out, place them on a glass dish, boil the syrup for another 5 minutes, let it cool a little,
pour over the fruit, and, when cold, it will be ready for use.

Time.--1/4 hour to simmer the fruit, 5 minutes the syrup.

Average cost, in full season, 10d.

GREENGAGE JAM.

1552. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit, weighed before being stoned, allow 3/4 lb. of lump
sugar.

Mode.--Divide the greengages, take out the stones, and put them into a preserving-pan. Bring
the fruit to a boil, then add the sugar, and keep stirring it over a gentle fire until it is
melted. Remove all the scum as it rises, and, just before the jam is done, boil it rapidly
for 5 minutes. To ascertain when it is sufficiently boiled, pour a little on a plate, and if
the syrup thickens and appears firm, it is done. Have ready half the kernels blanched; put
them into the jam, give them one boil, and pour the preserve into pots. When cold, cover down
with oiled papers, and, over these, tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white
of an egg.

Time.--3/4 hour after the sugar is added.

Seasonable.--Make this in August or September.

TO PRESERVE AND DRY GREENGAGES.

1553. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1 lb. of fruit, 1/4 pint of water.

Mode.--For this purpose, the fruit must be used before it is quite ripe, and part of the stalk
must be left on. Weigh the fruit, rejecting all that is in the least degree blemished, and
put it into a lined saucepan with the sugar and water, which should have been previously boiled
together to a rich syrup. Boil the fruit in this for 10 minutes, remove it from the fire, and
drain the greengages. The next day, boil up the syrup and put in the fruit again, and let it
simmer for 3 minutes, and drain the syrup away. Continue this process for 5 or 6 days, and
the last time place the greengages, when drained, on a hair sieve, and put them in an oven
or warm spot to dry; keep them in a box, with paper between each layer, in a place free from damp.

Time.--10 minutes the first time of boiling.

Seasonable.--Make this in August or September.

PRESERVED GREENGAGES IN SYRUP.

1554. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar 1/4 pint of water.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water together for about 10 minutes; divide the greengages, take
out the stones, put the fruit into the syrup, and let it simmer gently until nearly tender.
Take it off the fire, put it into a large pan, and, the next day, boil it up again for about
10 minutes with the kernels from the stones, which should be blanched. Put the fruit carefully
into jars, pour over it the syrup, and, when cold, cover down, so that the air is quite excluded.
Let the syrup be well skimmed both the first and second day of boiling, otherwise it will not
be clear.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the syrup; 1/4 hour to simmer the fruit the first day, 10 minutes
the second day.

Seasonable.--Make this in August or September.

TO MAKE FRUIT ICE-CREAMS.

1555. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of fruit-juice allow 1 pint of cream; sugar to taste.

Mode.--Let the fruit be well ripened; pick it off the stalks, and put it into a large earthen
pan. Stir it about with a wooden spoon, breaking it until it is well mashed; then, with the
back of the spoon, rub it through a hair sieve. Sweeten it nicely with pounded sugar; whip
the cream for a few minutes, add it to the fruit, and whisk the whole again for another 5 minutes.
Put the mixture into the freezing-pot, and freeze in the same manner as directed for Ice Pudding,
No. 1290, taking care to stir the cream, &c., two or three times, and to remove it from the
sides of the vessel, that the mixture may be equally frozen and smooth. Ices are usually served
in glasses, but if moulded, as they sometimes are for dessert, must have a small quantity of
melted isinglass added to them, to enable them to keep their shape. Raspberry, strawberry,
currant, and all fruit ice-creams, are made in the same manner. A little pounded sugar sprinkled
over the fruit before it is mashed assists to extract the juice. In winter, when fresh fruit
is not obtainable, a little jam may be substituted for it: it should be melted and worked through
a sieve before being added to the whipped cream; and if the colour should not be good, a little
prepared cochineal or beetroot may be put in to improve its appearance.

Seasonable, with fresh fruit, in June, July, and August.

TO MAKE FRUIT-WATER ICES.

1556. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of fruit-juice allow 1 pint of syrup made by recipe No. 1513.

Mode.--Select nice ripe fruit; pick off the stalks, and put it into a large earthen pan, with
a little pounded sugar strewed over; stir it about with a wooden spoon until it is well broken,
then rub it through a hair sieve. Make the syrup by recipe No. 1513, omitting the white of
the egg; let it cool, add the fruit-juice, mix well together, and put the mixture into the
freezing-pot. Proceed as directed for Ice Puddings, No. 1290, and when the mixture is equally
frozen, put it into small glasses. Raspberry, strawberry, currant, and other fresh-fruit-water
ices, are made in the same manner.

Seasonable, with fresh fruit, in June, July, and August.

LEMON-WATER ICE.

1557. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of syrup, made by recipe No. 1513, allow 1/3 pint of lemon-juice;
the rind of 4 lemons.

Mode.--Rub the sugar on the rinds of the lemons, and with it make the syrup by recipe No. 1513,
omitting the white of egg. Strain the lemon-juice, add it to the other ingredients, stir well,
and put the mixture into a freezing-pot. Freeze as directed for Ice Pudding, No. 1290, and,
when the mixture is thoroughly and equally frozen, put it into ice-glasses.

ICED CURRANTS, for Dessert.

1558. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of water, the whites of 2 eggs, currants, pounded sugar.

Mode.--Select very fine bunches of red or white currants, and well beat the whites of the eggs.
Mix these with the water; then take the currants, a bunch at a time, and dip them in; let them
drain for a minute or two, and roll them in very fine pounded sugar. Lay them to dry on paper,
when the sugar will crystallize round each currant, and have a very pretty effect. All fresh
fruit may be prepared in the same manner; and a mixture of various fruits iced in this manner,
and arranged on one dish, looks very well for a summer dessert.

Time.--1/4 day to dry the fruit.

Average cost, 8d. for a pint of iced currants. Seasonable in summer.

MELONS.

1559.--This fruit is rarely preserved or cooked in any way, and should be sent to table on
a dish garnished with leaves or flowers, as fancy dictates. A border of any other kind of small
fruit, arranged round the melon, has a pretty effect, the colour the former contrasting nicely
with the melon. Plenty of pounded sugar should be served with it; and the fruit should be cut
lengthwise, in moderate-sized slices. In America, it is frequently eaten with pepper and salt.

Average cost,--English, in full season, 3s. 6d. to 5s. each; when scarce, 10s. to 15s.; seasonable,
June to August. French, 2s. to 3s. 6d. each; seasonable, June and July. Dutch, 9d. to 2s. each;
seasonable, July and August.

    MELON.--The melon is a most delicious fruit, succulent, cool,
    and high-flavoured. With us, it is used only at the dessert, and
    is generally eaten with sugar, ginger, or pepper; but, in
    France, it is likewise served up at dinner as a sauce for boiled
    meats. It grows wild in Tartary, and has been lately found in
    abundance on the sandy plains of Jeypoor. It was brought
    originally from Asia by the Romans, and is said to have been
    common in England in the time of Edward III., though it is
    supposed that it was lost again, as well as the cucumber, during
    the wars of York and Lancaster. The best kind, called the
    Cantaloupe, from the name of a place near Rome where it was
    first cultivated in Europe, is a native of Armenia, where it
    grows so plentifully that a horse-load may be bought for a
    crown.

PRESERVED MULBERRIES.

1560. INGREDIENTS.--To 2 lbs. of fruit and 1 pint of juice allow 2-1/2 lbs. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Put some of the fruit into a preserving-pan, and simmer it gently until the juice is
well drawn. Strain it through a bag, measure it, and to every pint allow the above proportion
of sugar and fruit. Put the sugar into the preserving-pan, moisten it with the juice, boil
it up, skim well, and then add the mulberries, which should be ripe, but not soft enough to
break to a pulp. Let them stand in the syrup till warm through, then set them on the fire to
boil gently; when half done, turn them carefully into an earthen pan, and let them remain till
the next day; then boil them as before, and when the syrup is thick, and becomes firm when
cold, put the preserve into pots. In making this, care should be taken not to break the mulberries:
this may be avoided by very gentle stirring, and by simmering the fruit very slowly.

Time.--3/4 hour to extract the juice;

1/4 hour to boil the mulberries the first time, 1/4 hour the second time.

Seasonable in August and September.

MULBERRY.--Mulberries are esteemed for their highly aromatic flavour, and their sub-acid nature.
They are considered as cooling, laxative, and generally wholesome. This fruit was very highly
esteemed by the Romans, who appear to have preferred it to every other. The mulberry-tree is
stated to have been introduced into this country in 1548, being first planted at Sion House,
where the original trees still thrive. The planting of them was much encouraged by King James
I. about 1605; and considerable attempts were made at that time to rear silkworms on a large
scale for the purpose of making silk; but these endeavours have always failed, the climate
being scarcely warm enough.

TO PRESERVE MORELLO CHERRIES.

1561. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of cherries allow 1-1/4 lb. of sugar, 1 gill of water.

Mode.--Select ripe cherries; pick off the stalks, and reject all that have any blemishes. Boil
the sugar and water together for 5 minutes; put in the cherries, and boil them for 10 minutes,
removing the scum as it rises. Then turn the fruit, &c. into a pan, and let it remain until
the next day, when boil it all again for another 10 minutes, and, if necessary, skim well.
Put the cherries into small pots; pour over them the syrup, and, when cold, cover down with
oiled papers, and the tops of the jars with tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the
white of an egg, and keep in a dry place.

Time.--Altogether, 25 minutes to boil.

Average cost, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. pot.

Seasonable.--Make this in July or August.

THE CHERRY-TREE IN ROME.--The Cherry-tree was introduced into Rome by Lucullus about seventy
years before the Christian era; but the capital of the world knew not at first how to appreciate
this present as it deserved; for the cherry-tree was propagated so slowly in Italy, that more
than a century after its introduction it was far from being generally cultivated. The Romans
distinguished three principal species of cherries--the Apronian, of a bright red, with a firm
and delicate pulp; the Lutatian, very black and sweet; the Caecilian, round and stubby, and
much esteemed. The cherry embellished the third course in Rome and the second at Athens.

PRESERVED NECTARINES.

1562. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1/4 pint of water; nectarines.

Mode.--Divide the nectarines in two, take out the stones, and make a strong syrup with sugar
and water in the above proportion. Put in the nectarines, and boil them until they have thoroughly
imbibed the sugar. Keep the fruit as whole as possible, and turn it carefully into a pan. The
next day boil it again for a few minutes, take out the nectarines, put them into jars, boil
the syrup quickly for 5 minutes, pour it over the fruit, and, when cold, cover the preserve
down. The syrup and preserve must be carefully skimmed, or it will not be clear.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the sugar and water; 20 minutes to boil the fruit the first time,
10 minutes the second time; 5 minutes to boil the syrup.

Seasonable in August and September, but cheapest in September.

STEWED NORMANDY PIPPINS.

1563. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of Normandy pippins, 1 quart of water, 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered
cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoonful of ground ginger, 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lemon.

Mode.--Well wash the pippins, and put them into 1 quart of water with the above proportion
of cinnamon and ginger, and let them stand 12 hours; then put these all together into a stewpan,
with the lemon sliced thinly, and half the moist sugar. Let them boil slowly until the pippins
are half done; then add the remainder of the sugar, and simmer until they are quite tender.
Serve on glass dishes for dessert.

Time.--2 to 3 hours. Average cost, 1s. 6d. Seasonable.--Suitable for a winter dish.

ICED ORANGES.

1564. INGREDIENTS.--Oranges; to every lb. of pounded loaf sugar allow the whites of 2 eggs.

Mode.--Whisk the whites of the eggs well, stir in the sugar, and beat this mixture for 1/4
hour. Skin the oranges, remove as much of the white pith as possible without injuring the pulp
of the fruit; pass a thread through the centre of each orange, dip them into the sugar, and
tie them to a stick. Place this stick across the oven, and let the oranges remain until dry,
when they will have the appearance of balls of ice. They make a pretty dessert or supper dish.
Care must be taken not to have the oven too fierce, or the oranges would scorch and acquire
a brown colour, which would entirely spoil their appearance.

Time.--From 1/2 to 1 hour to dry in a moderate oven.

Average cost, 1-1/2d. each.

Sufficient.--1/2 lb. of sugar to ice 12 oranges.

Seasonable from November to May.

THE FIRST ORANGE-TREE IN FRANCE.--The first Orange-tree cultivated in the centre of France
was to be seen a few years ago at Fontainebleau. It was called Le Connétable (the Constable),
because it had belonged to the Connétable de Bourbon, and had been confiscated, together with
all property belonging to that prince, after his revolt against his sovereign.

COMPOTE OF ORANGES.

1565. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1512, 6 oranges. Mode.--Peel the oranges, remove as
much of the white pith as possible, and divide them into small pieces without breaking the
thin skin with which they are surrounded. Make the syrup by recipe No. 1512, adding the rind
of the orange cut into thin narrow strips. When the syrup has been well skimmed, and is quite
clear, put in the pieces of orange, and simmer them for 5 minutes. Take them out carefully
with a spoon without breaking them, and arrange them on a glass dish. Reduce the syrup by boiling
it quickly until thick; let it cool a little, pour it over the oranges, and, when cold, they
will be ready for table.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the syrup; 5 minutes to simmer the oranges; 5 minutes to reduce the
syrup.

THE ORANGE IN PORTUGAL.--The Orange known under the name of "Portugal Orange" comes originally
from China. Not more than two centuries ago, the Portuguese brought thence the first scion,
which has multiplied so prodigiously that we now see entire forests of orange-trees in Portugal.

ORANGE AND CLOVES.--It appears to have been the custom formerly, in England, to make new year's
presents with oranges stuck full with cloves. We read in one of Ben Jonson's pieces,--the "Christmas
Masque,"--"He has an orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick in it."

ORANGE MARMALADE.

I.

1566. INGREDIENTS.--Equal weight of fine loaf sugar and Seville oranges; to 12 oranges allow
1 pint of water.

Mode.--Let there be an equal weight of loaf sugar and Seville oranges, and allow the above
proportion of water to every dozen oranges. Peel them carefully, remove a little of the white
pith, and boil the rinds in water 2 hours, changing the water three times to take off a little
of the bitter taste. Break the pulp into small pieces, take out all the pips, and cut the boiled
rind into chips. Make a syrup with the sugar and water; boil this well, skim it, and, when
clear, put in the pulp and chips. Boil all together from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; pour it into
pots, and, when cold, cover down with bladders or tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with
the white of an egg. The juice and grated rind of 2 lemons to every dozen of oranges, added
with the pulp and chips to the syrup, are a very great improvement to this marmalade.

Time.--2 hours to boil the orange-rinds; 10 minutes to boil the syrup; 20 minutes to 1/2 hour
to boil the marmalade.

Average cost, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.

Seasonable.--This should be made in March or April, as Seville oranges are then in perfection.

II.

1567. INGREDIENTS.--Equal weight of Seville oranges and sugar; to every lb. of sugar allow
1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Weigh the sugar and oranges, score the skin across, and take it off in quarters. Boil
these quarters in a muslin bag in water until they are quite soft, and they can be pierced
easily with the head of a pin; then cut them into chips about 1 inch long, and as thin as possible.
Should there be a great deal of white stringy pulp, remove it before cutting the rind into
chips. Split open the oranges, scrape out the best part of the pulp, with the juice, rejecting
the white pith and pips. Make a syrup with the sugar and water; boil it until clear; then put
in the chips, pulp, and juice, and boil the marmalade from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, removing
all the scum as it rises. In boiling the syrup, clear it carefully from scum before the oranges
are added to it.

AN EASY WAY OF MAKING ORANGE MARMALADE.

1568. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of pulp allow 1-1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Choose some fine Seville oranges; put them whole into a stewpan with sufficient water
to cover them, and stew them until they become perfectly tender, changing the water 2 or 3
times; drain them, take off the rind, remove the pips from the pulp, weigh it, and to every
lb. allow 1-1/2 of loaf sugar and 1/2 pint of the water the oranges were last boiled in. Boil
the sugar and water together for 10 minutes; put in the pulp, boil for another 10 minutes;
then add the peel cut into strips, and boil the marmalade for another 10 minutes, which completes
the process.

ORANGE MARMALADE MADE WITH HONEY.

1569. INGREDIENTS.--To 1 quart of the juice and pulp of Seville oranges allow 2 lbs. of honey,
1 lb. of the rind.

Mode.--Peel the oranges and boil the rind in water until tender, and cut it into strips. Take
away the pips from the juice and pulp, and put it with the honey and chips into a preserving-pan;
boil all together for about 1/2 hour, or until the marmalade is of the proper consistency;
put it into pots, and, when cold, cover down with bladders.

Time.--2 hours to boil the rind, 1/2 hour the marmalade.

Average cost, from 7d. to 9d. per lb. pot.

Seasonable.--Make this in March or April.

TO PRESERVE ORANGES.

1570. INGREDIENTS.--Oranges; to every lb. of juice and pulp allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar; to
every pint of water 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Wholly grate or peel the oranges, taking off only the thin outside portion of the rind.
Make a small incision where the stalk is taken out, squeeze out as much of the juice as can
be obtained, and preserve it in a basin with the pulp that accompanies it. Put the oranges
into cold water; let them stand for 3 days, changing the water twice; then boil them in fresh
water till they are very tender, and put them to drain. Make a syrup with the above proportion
of sugar and water, sufficient to cover the oranges; let them stand in it for 2 or 3 days;
then drain them well. Weigh the juice and pulp, allow double their weight of sugar, and boil
them together until the scum ceases to rise, which must all be carefully removed; put in the
oranges, boil them for 10 minutes, place them in jars, pour over them the syrup, and, when
cold, cover down. They will be fit for use in a week.

Time.--3 days for the oranges to remain in water, 3 days in the syrup; 1/2 hour to boil the
pulp, 10 minutes the oranges.

Seasonable.--This preserve should be made in February or March, when oranges are plentiful.

ORANGE SALAD.

1571. INGREDIENTS.--6 oranges, 1/4 lb. of muscatel raisins, 2 oz. of pounded sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls
of brandy.

Mode.--Peel 5 of the oranges; divide them into slices without breaking the pulp, and arrange
them on a glass dish. Stone the raisins, mix them with the sugar and brandy, and mingle them
with the oranges. Squeeze the juice of the other orange over the whole, and the dish is ready
for table. A little pounded spice may be put in when the flavour is liked; but this ingredient
must be added very sparingly.

COMPOTE OF PEACHES.

1572. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1512, about 15 small peaches.

Mode.--Peaches that are not very large, and that would not look well
for dessert, answer very nicely for a compôte. Divide the peaches, take
out the stones, and pare the fruit; make a syrup by recipe No. 1512, put
in the peaches, and stew them gently for about 10 minutes. Take them out
without breaking, arrange them on a glass dish, boil the syrup for 2 or
3 minutes, let it cool, pour it over the fruit, and, when cold, it will
be ready for table. At Montreuil, a village
    near Paris, almost the whole population is employed in the
    cultivation of peaches; and this occupation has maintained the
    inhabitants for ages, and, in consequence, they raise better
    peaches than anywhere else in France. In Maryland and Virginia,
    peaches grow nearly wild in orchards resembling forests; but the
    fruit is of little value for the table, being employed only in
    fattening hogs and for the distillation of peach brandy. On the
    east side of the Andes, peaches grow wild among the cornfields
    and in the mountains, and are dried as an article of food. The
    young leaves of the peach are sometimes used in cookery, from
    their agreeable flavour; and a liqueur resembling the fine
    noyeau of Martinique may be made by steeping them in brandy
    sweetened with sugar and fined with milk: gin may also be
    flavoured in the same manner. The kernels of the fruit have the
    same flavour. The nectarine is said to have received its name
    from nectar, the particular drink of the gods. Though it is
    considered as the same species as the peach, it is not known
    which of the varieties come from the other; the nectarine, is by
    some considered as the superior fruit.

PEACHES PRESERVED IN BRANDY.

1573. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit weighed before being stoned, allow 1/4 lb. of finely-pounded
loaf sugar; brandy.

Mode.--Let the fruit be gathered in dry weather; wipe and weigh it, and remove the stones as
carefully as possible, without injuring the peaches much. Put them into a jar, sprinkle amongst
them pounded loaf sugar in the above proportion, and pour brandy over the fruit. Cover the
jar down closely, place it in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and bring the brandy
to the simmering-point, but do not allow it to boil. Take the fruit out carefully, without
breaking it; put it into small jars, pour over it the brandy, and, when cold, exclude the air
by covering the jars with bladders, or tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white
of an egg. Apricots may be done in the same manner, and, if properly prepared, will be found
delicious.

Time.--From 10 to 20 minutes to bring the brandy to the simmering-point.

Seasonable in August and September.

BAKED PEARS.

1574. Place them in a clean baking-jar, with a closely-fitting lid; add to them the lemon-rind
cut in strips, the juice of 1/2 lemon, the cloves, pounded allspice, and sufficient water just
to cover the whole, with sugar in the above proportion. Cover the jar down closely, put it
into a very cool oven, and bake the pears from 5 to 6 hours, but be very careful that the oven
is not too hot. To improve the colour of the fruit, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be
added; but this will not be found necessary if the pears are very gently baked.

Time.--Large pears, 5 to 6 hours, in a very slow oven.

Average cost, 1d. to 2d. each.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable from September to January.

    PEAR.--The pear, like the apple, is indigenous to this country;
    but the wild pear is a very unsatisfactory fruit. The best
    varieties were brought from the East by the Romans, who
    cultivated them with care, and probably introduced some of their
    best sorts into this island, to which others were added by the
    inhabitants of the monasteries. The Dutch and Flemings, as well
    as the French, have excelled in the cultivation of the pear, and
    most of the late varieties introduced are from France and
    Flanders. The pear is a hardy tree, and a longer liver than the
    apple: it has been known to exist for centuries. There are now
    about 150 varieties of this fruit. Though perfectly wholesome
    when ripe, the pear is not so when green; but in this state it
    is fit for stewing. An agreeable beverage, called perry, is made
    from pears, and the varieties which are least fit for eating
    make the best perry.

PRESERVED PEARS.

1575. INGREDIENTS.--Jargonelle pears; to every lb. of sugar allow 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Procure some Jargonelle pears, not too ripe; put them into a stewpan with sufficient
water to cover them, and simmer them till rather tender, but do not allow them to break; then
put them into cold water. Boil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes, skim well, put in
the pears, and simmer them gently for 5 minutes. Repeat the simmering for 3 successive days,
taking care not to let the fruit break. The last time of boiling, the syrup should be made
rather richer, and the fruit boiled for 10 minutes. When the pears are done, drain them from
the syrup, and dry them in the sun, or in a cool oven; or they may be kept in the syrup, and
dried as they are wanted.

Time.--1/2 hour to simmer the pears in water, 20 minutes in the syrup.

Average cost, 1d. to 2d. each.

Seasonable.--Most plentiful in September and October.

STEWED PEARS.

1576. INGREDIENTS.--8 large pears, 5 oz. of loaf sugar, 6 cloves, 6 whole allspice, 1/2 pint
of water, 1/4 pint of port wine, a few drops of prepared cochineal.

Mode.--Pare the pears, halve them, remove the cores, and leave the stalks on; put them into
a lined saucepan with the above ingredients, and let them simmer very gently until tender,
which will be in from 3 to 4 hours, according to the quality of the pears. They should be watched,
and, when done, carefully lifted out on to a glass dish without breaking them. Boil up the
syrup quickly for 2 or 3 minutes; allow it to cool a little, pour it over the pears, and let
them get perfectly cold. To improve the colour of the fruit, a few drops of prepared cochineal
may be added, which rather enhances the beauty of this dish. The fruit must not be boiled fast,
but only simmered, and watched that it be not too much done.

    THE BON CHRETIEN PEAR.--The valuable variety of pear called Bon
    Chrétien, which comes to our tables in winter, either raw or
    cooked, received its name through the following incident:--Louis
    XI., king of France, had sent for Saint Francois de Paule from
    the lower part of Calabria, in the hopes of recovering his
    health through his intercession. The saint brought with him the
    seeds of this pear; and, as he was called at court Le Bon
    Chrétien, this fruit obtained the name of him to whom France
    owed its introduction.

PINEAPPLE CHIPS.

1577. INGREDIENTS.--Pineapples; sugar to taste.

Mode.--Pare and slice the fruit thinly, put it on dishes, and strew over it plenty of pounded
sugar. Keep it in a hot closet, or very slow oven, 8 or 10 days, and turn the fruit every day
until dry; then put the pieces of pine on tins, and place them in a quick oven for 10 minutes.
Let them cool, and store them away in dry boxes, with paper between each layer.

Time.--8 to 10 days.

Seasonable.--Foreign pines, in July and August.

PRESERVED PINEAPPLE.

1578. Cut them into rather thick slices, as the fruit shrinks very much in the boiling. Pare
off the rind carefully, that none of the pine be wasted; and, in doing so, notch it in and
out, as the edge cannot be smoothly cut without great waste. Dissolve a portion of the sugar
in a preserving-pan with 1/4 pint of water; when this is melted, gradually add the remainder
of the sugar, and boil it until it forms a clear syrup, skimming well. As soon as this is the
case, put in the pieces of pine, and boil well for at least 1/2 hour, or until it looks nearly
transparent. Put it into pots, cover down when cold, and store away in a dry place.

Time.--1/2 hour to boil the fruit. Average cost, 10d. to 1s. per lb. pot.

Seasonable.--Foreign pines, in July and August.

    THE PINEAPPLE IN HEATHENDOM.--Heathen nations invented
    protective divinities for their orchards (such as Pomona,
    Vertumnus, Priapus, &c.), and benevolent patrons for their
    fruits: thus, the olive-tree grew under the auspices of Minerva;
    the Muses cherished the palm-tree, Bacchus the fig and grape,
    and the pine and its cone were consecrated to the great Cyble.

PRESERVED PINEAPPLE, for Present Use.

1579. INGREDIENTS.--Pineapple, sugar, water.

Mode.--Cut the pine into slices 1/4 inch in thickness; peel them, and remove the hard part
from the middle. Put the parings and hard pieces into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover
them, and boil for 1/4 hour. Strain the liquor, and put in the slices of pine. Stew them for
10 minutes, add sufficient sugar to sweeten the whole nicely, and boil again for another 1/4
hour; skim well, and the preserve will be ready for use. It must be eaten soon, as it will
keep but a very short time.

Time.--1/4 hour to boil the parings in water; 10 minutes to boil the pine without sugar, 1/4
hour with sugar.

Average cost.--Foreign pines, 1s. to 3s. each; English, from 2s. to 12s. per lb.

Seasonable.--Foreign, in July and August; English, all the year.

PLUM JAM.

1580. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of plums, weighed before being stoned, allow 3/4 lb. of loaf
sugar.

Mode.--In making plum jam, the quantity of sugar for each lb. of fruit must be regulated by
the quality and size of the fruit, some plums requiring much more sugar than others. Divide
the plums, take out the stones, and put them on to large dishes, with roughly-pounded sugar
sprinkled over them in the above proportion, and let them remain for one day; then put them
into a preserving-pan, stand them by the side of the fire to simmer gently for about 1/2 hour,
and then boil them rapidly for another 15 minutes. The scum must be carefully removed as it
rises, and the jam must be well stirred all the time, or it will burn at the bottom of the
pan, and so spoil the colour and flavour of the preserve. Some of the stones may be cracked,
and a few kernels added to the jam just before it is done: these impart a very delicious flavour
to the plums. The above proportion of sugar would answer for Orleans plums; the Impératrice
Magnum-bonum, and Winesour would not require quite so much.

Time.--1/2 hour to simmer gently, 1/4 hour to boil rapidly.

Best plums for preserving.--Violets, Mussels, Orleans, Impératrice Magnum-bonum, and Winesour.

Seasonable from the end of July to the beginning of October.

    PLUMS.--The Damson, or Damascene plum, takes its name from
    Damascus, where it grows in great quantities, and whence it was
    brought into Italy about 114 B.C. The Orleans plum is from
    France. The Greengage is called after the Gage family, who first
    brought it into England from the monastery of the Chartreuse, at
    Paris, where it still bears the name of Reine Claude. The
    Magnum-bonum is our largest plum, and greatly esteemed for
    preserves and culinary purposes. The best sorts of plums are
    agreeable at the dessert, and, when perfectly ripe, are
    wholesome; but some are too astringent. They lose much of their
    bad qualities by baking, and are extensively used, from their
    cheapness, when in full season, in tarts and preserves; but they
    are not a very wholesome fruit, and should be eaten in
    moderation.

PRESERVED PLUMS.

1581.

Mode.--Select large ripe plums; slightly prick them, to prevent them from bursting, and simmer
them very gently in a syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and water. Put them carefully
into a pan, let the syrup cool, pour it over the plums, and allow them to remain for two days.
Having previously weighed the other sugar, dip the lumps quickly into water, and put them into
a preserving-pan with no more water than hangs about them; and boil the sugar to a syrup, carefully
skimming it. Drain the plums from the first syrup; put them into the fresh syrup, and simmer
them very gently until they are clear; lift them out singly into pots, pour the syrup over,
and when cold, cover down to exclude the air. This preserve will remain good some time, if
kept in a dry place, and makes a very nice addition to a dessert. The magnum-bonum plums answer
for this preserve better than any other kind of plum. Greengages are also very delicious done
in this manner.

Time.--1/4 hour to 20 minutes to simmer the plums in the first syrup; 20 minutes to 1/2 hour
very gentle simmering in the second.

Seasonable from August to October.

TO PRESERVE PLUMS DRY.

1582. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1/4 pint of water. Mode.--Gather the plums
when they are full-grown and just turning colour; prick them, put them into a saucepan of cold
water, and set them on the fire until the water is on the point of boiling. Then take them
out, drain them, and boil them gently in syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and
water; and if the plums shrink, and will not take the sugar, prick them as they lie in the
pan; give them another boil, skim, and set them by. The next day add some more sugar, boiled
almost to candy, to the fruit and syrup; put all together into a wide-mouthed jar, and place
them in a cool oven for 2 nights; then drain the plums from the syrup, sprinkle a little powdered
sugar over, and dry them in a cool oven.

Time.--15 to 20 minutes to boil the plums in the syrup. Seasonable from August to October.

    PLUMS.--The wild sloe is the parent of the plum, but the
    acclimated kinds come from the East. The cultivation of this
    fruit was probably attended to very early in England, as Gerrard
    informs us that, in 1597, he had in his garden, in Holborn,
    threescore sorts. The sloe is a shrub common in our hedgerows,
    and belongs to the natural order Amygdaleae; the fruit is
    about the size of a large pea, of a black colour, and covered
    with a bloom of a bright blue. It is one of the few indigenous
    to our island. The juice is extremely sharp and astringent, and
    was formerly employed as a medicine, where astringents were
    necessary. It now assists in the manufacture of a red wine made
    to imitate port, and also for adulteration. The leaves have been
    used to adulterate tea; the fruit, when ripe, makes a good
    preserve.

STEWED FRENCH PLUMS.

(A Dessert Dish.)

1583. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of French plums, 3/4 pint of syrup No. 1512, 1 glass of port
wine, the rind and juice of 1 lemon.

Mode.--Stew the plums gently in water for 1 hour; strain the water, and with it make the syrup.
When it is clear, put in the plums with the port wine, lemon-juice, and rind, and simmer very
gently for 1-1/2 hour. Arrange the plums on a glass dish, take out the lemon-rind, pour the
syrup over the plums, and, when cold, they will be ready for table. A little allspice stewed
with the fruit is by many persons considered an improvement.

Time.--1 hour to stew the plums in water, 1-1/2 hour in the syrup.

Average cost,--plums sufficiently good for stewing, 1s. per lb.

Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons.

Seasonable in winter.

PRESERVED PUMPKIN.

1584. INGREDIENTS.--To each lb. of pumpkin allow 1 lb. of roughly pounded loaf sugar, 1 gill
of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Obtain a good sweet pumpkin; halve it, take out the seeds, and pare off the rind; cut
it into neat slices, or into pieces about the size of a five-shilling piece. Weigh the pumpkin,
put the slices in a pan or deep dish in layers, with the sugar sprinkled between them; pour
the lemon-juice over the top, and let the whole remain for 2 or 3 days. Boil altogether, adding
1/4 pint of water to every 3 lbs. of sugar used until the pumpkin becomes tender; then turn
the whole into a pan, where let it remain for a week; then drain off the syrup, boil it until
it is quite thick; skim, and pour it, boiling, over the pumpkin. A little bruised ginger and
lemon-rind, thinly pared, may be boiled in the syrup to flavour the pumpkin.

Time.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the pumpkin tender.

Average cost, 5d. to 7d. per lb. pot.

Seasonable in September and October; but better when made in the latter month, as the pumpkin
is then quite ripe.

Note.--Vegetable marrows are very good prepared in the same manner, but are not quite so rich.

QUINCE JELLY.

1585. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of juice allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Pare and slice the quinces, and put them into a preserving-pan with sufficient water
to float them. Boil them until tender, and the fruit is reduced to a pulp; strain off the clear
juice, and to each pint allow the above proportion of loaf sugar. Boil the juice and sugar
together for about 3/4 hour; remove all the scum as it rises, and, when the jelly appears firm
when a little is poured on a plate, it is done. The residue left on the sieve will answer to
make a common marmalade, for immediate use, by boiling it with 1/2 lb. of common sugar to every
lb. of pulp.

Time.--3 hours to boil the quinces in water; 3/4 hour to boil the jelly.

Average cost, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. pot.

Seasonable from August to October.

QUINCE MARMALADE.

1586. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of quince pulp allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Slice the quinces into a preserving-pan, adding sufficient water for them to float;
place them on the fire to stew, until reduced to a pulp, keeping them stirred occasionally
from the bottom, to prevent their burning; then pass the pulp through a hair sieve, to keep
back the skin and seeds. Weigh the pulp, and to each lb. add lump sugar in the above proportion,
broken very small. Place the whole on the fire, and keep it well stirred from the bottom of
the pan with a wooden spoon, until reduced to a marmalade, which may be known by dropping a
little on a cold plate, when, if it jellies, it is done. Put it into jars whilst hot; let it
cool, and cover with pieces of oiled paper cut to the size of the mouths of the jars.

Average cost, from 8d. to 9d. per lb. pot.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 pint of sliced quinces for a lb. pot.

Seasonable in August, September, and October.

RAISIN CHEESE.

1587. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of raisins allow a lb. of loaf sugar; pounded cinnamon and
cloves to taste.

Mode.--Stone the raisins; put them into a stewpan with the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves, and
let them boil for 1-1/2 hour, stirring all the time. Let the preparation cool a little, pour
it into a glass dish, and garnish with strips of candied lemon-peel and citron. This will remain
good some time, if kept in a dry place. Seasonable at any time.

RASPBERRY JAM.

1588. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of raspberries allow 1 lb. of sugar, 1/4 pint of red-currant
juice.

Mode.--Let the fruit for this preserve be gathered in fine weather, and used as soon after
it is picked as possible. Take off the stalks, put the raspberries into a preserving-pan, break
them well with a wooden spoon, and let them boil for 1/4 hour, keeping them well stirred. Then
add the currant-juice and sugar, and boil again for 1/2 hour. Skim the jam well after the sugar
is added, or the preserve will not be clear. The addition of the currant juice is a very great
improvement to this preserve, as it gives it a piquant taste, which the flavour of the raspberries
seems to require.

RASPBERRY JELLY.

1589. When the juice is well drawn, which will be in from 3/4 to 1 hour, strain the fruit through
a fine hair sieve or cloth; measure the juice, and to every pint allow the above proportion
of loaf sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a preserving-pan, place it over the fire, and boil
gently until the jelly thickens when a little is poured on a plate; carefully remove all the
scum as it rises, pour the jelly into small pots, cover down, and keep in a dry place. This
jelly answers for making raspberry cream, and for flavouring various sweet dishes, when, in
winter, the fresh fruit is not obtainable.

Time.--3/4 to 1 hour to draw the juice.

RHUBARB JAM.

1590. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of rhubarb allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar, the rind of 1/2 lemon.

Mode.--Wipe the rhubarb perfectly dry, take off the string or peel, and weigh it; put it into
a preserving-pan, with sugar in the above proportion; mince the lemon-rind very finely, add
it to the other ingredients, and place the preserving-pan by the side of the fire; keep stirring
to prevent the rhubarb from burning, and when the sugar is well dissolved, put the pan more
over the fire, and let the jam boil until it is done, taking care to keep it well skimmed and
stirred with a wooden or silver spoon. Pour it into pots, and cover down with oiled and egged
papers.

Time.--If the rhubarb is young and tender, 3/4 hour, reckoning from the time it simmers equally;
old rhubarb, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour.

Average cost, 5d. to 7d. per lb. pot.

Sufficient.--About 1 pint of sliced rhubarb to fill a lb. pot.

Seasonable from February to April.

RHUBARB AND ORANGE JAM, to resemble Scotch Marmalade.

1591. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of finely-cut rhubarb, 6 oranges, 1-1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Peel the oranges; remove as much of the white pith as possible, divide them, and take
out the pips; slice the pulp into a preserving-pan, add the rind of half the oranges cut into
thin strips, and the loaf sugar, which should be broken small. Peel the rhubarb, cut it into
thin pieces, put it to the oranges, and stir altogether over a gentle fire until the jam is
done. Remove all the scum as it rises, put the preserve into pots, and, when cold, cover down.
Should the rhubarb be very old, stew it alone for 1/4 hour before the other ingredients are added.

Seasonable from February to April.

RASPBERRY AND CURRANT, or any Fresh Fruit Salad.

(A Dessert Dish.)

1592. Mode.--Fruit salads are made by stripping the fruit from the stalks, piling it on a dish,
and sprinkling over it finely-pounded sugar. They may be made of strawberries, raspberries,
currants, or any of these fruits mixed; peaches also make a very good salad. After the sugar
is sprinkled over, about 6 large tablespoonfuls of wine or brandy, or 3 tablespoonfuls of liqueur,
should be poured in the middle of the fruit; and, when the flavour is liked, a little pounded
cinnamon may be added. In helping the fruit, it should be lightly stirred, that the wine and
sugar may be equally distributed.

Sufficient.--1-1/2 pint of fruit, with 3 oz. of pounded sugar, for 4 or 5 persons.

Seasonable in summer.

STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM.

1593. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of picked strawberries allow 1/3 pint of cream, 2 oz. of
finely-pounded sugar.

Mode.--Pick the stalks from the fruit, place it on a glass dish, sprinkle over it pounded sugar,
and slightly stir the strawberries, that they may all be equally sweetened; pour the cream
over the top, and serve. Devonshire cream, when it can be obtained, is exceedingly delicious
for this dish; and, if very thick indeed, may be diluted with a little thin cream or milk.

Average cost for this quantity, with cream at 1s. per pint, 1s.

Sufficient for 2 persons.

Seasonable in June and July.

STRAWBERRY JAM.

1594. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 1/2 pint of red-currant juice, 1-1/4 lb. of
loaf sugar. Select well-ripened but sound strawberries; pick them from the stalks, and when
the sugar is dissolved in the currant juice, put in the fruit. Simmer the whole over a moderate
fire, from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, carefully removing the scum as it rises. Stir the jam only enough
to prevent it from burning at the bottom of the pan, as the fruit should be preserved as whole
as possible. Put the jam into jars, and when cold, cover down.

Average cost, from 7d. to 8d. per lb. pot.

Sufficient.--12 pints of strawberries will make 12 lb. pots of jam.

Seasonable in June and July.

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES IN WINE.

1595. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart bottle allow 1/4 lb. of finely-pounded loaf sugar; sherry
or Madeira.

Mode.--Let the fruit be gathered in fine weather, and used as soon as picked. Pick the stalks
from the strawberries, drop them into the bottles, sprinkling amongst them pounded sugar in
the above proportion, and when the fruit reaches to the neck of the bottle, fill up with sherry
or Madeira. Cork the bottles down with new corks, and dip them into melted resin.

Seasonable.--Make this in June or July.

TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES WHOLE.

1596. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 1-1/2 lb. of good loaf sugar, 1 pint of red-currant
juice.

Mode.--Choose the strawberries not too ripe, of a fine large sort and of a good colour. Pick
off the stalks, lay the strawberries in a dish, and sprinkle over them half the quantity of
sugar, which must be finely pounded. Shake the dish gently, that the sugar may be equally distributed
and touch the under-side of the fruit, and let it remain for 1 day. Then have ready the currant-juice,
drawn as for red-currant jelly No. 1533; boil it with the remainder of the sugar until it forms
a thin syrup, and in this simmer the strawberries and sugar, until the whole is sufficiently
jellied. Great care must be taken not to stir the fruit roughly, as it should be preserved
as whole as possible. Strawberries prepared in this manner are very good served in glasses
and mixed with thin cream.

Time.--1/4 hour to 20 minutes to simmer the strawberries in the syrup.

Seasonable in June and July.

TO MAKE EVERTON TOFFEE.

1597. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of powdered loaf sugar, 1 teacupful of water, 1/4 lb. of butter,
6 drops of essence of lemon.

Mode.--Put the water and sugar into a brass pan, and beat the butter to a cream. When the sugar
is dissolved, add the butter, and keep stirring the mixture over the fire until it sets, when
a little is poured on to a buttered dish; and just before the toffee is done, add the essence
of lemon. Butter a dish or tin, pour on it the mixture, and when cool, it will easily separate
from the dish. Butter-Scotch, an excellent thing for coughs, is made with brown, instead of
white sugar, omitting the water, and flavoured with 1/2 oz. of powdered ginger. It is made
in the same manner as toffee.

Time.--18 to 35 minutes.

Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient to make a lb. of toffee.

DESSERT DISHES.

1598. The tazza, or dish with stem, the same as that shown in our illustrations, is now the
favourite shape for dessert-dishes. The fruit can be arranged and shown to better advantage
on these tall high dishes than on the short flat ones. All the dishes are now usually placed
down the centre of the table, dried and fresh fruit alternately, the former being arranged
on small round or oval glass plates, and the latter on the dishes with stems. The fruit should
always be gathered on the same day that it is required for table, and should be tastefully
arranged on the dishes, with leaves between and round it. By purchasing fruits that are in
season, a dessert can be supplied at a very moderate cost. These, with a few fancy biscuits,
crystallized fruit, bon-bons, &c., are sufficient for an ordinary dessert. When fresh fruit
cannot be obtained, dried and foreign fruits, compotes, baked pears, stewed Normandy pippins,
&c. &c., must supply its place, with the addition of preserves, bon-bons, cakes, biscuits,
&c. At fashionable tables, forced fruit is served growing in pots, these pots being hidden
in more ornamental ones, and arranged with the other dishes.--(See coloured plate W1.) A few
vases of fresh flowers, tastefully arranged, add very much to the appearance of the dessert;
and, when these are not obtainable, a few paper ones, mixed with green leaves, answer very
well as a substitute. In decorating a table, whether for luncheon, dessert, or supper, a vase
or two of flowers should never be forgotten, as they add so much to the elegance of the tout
ensemble. In summer and autumn, ladies residing in the country can always manage to have a
few freshly-gathered flowers on their tables, and should never be without this inexpensive
luxury. On the continent, vases or epergnes filled with flowers are invariably placed down
the centre of the dinner-table at regular distances. Ices for dessert are usually moulded:
when this is not the case, they are handed round in glasses with wafers to accompany them.
Preserved ginger is frequently handed round after ices, to prepare the palate for the delicious
dessert wines. A basin or glass of finely-pounded lump sugar must never be omitted at a dessert,
as also a glass jug of fresh cold water (iced, if possible), and two goblets by its side. Grape-scissors,
a melon-knife and fork, and nutcrackers, should always be put on table, if there are dishes
of fruit requiring them. Zests are sometimes served at the close of the dessert; such as anchovy
toasts or biscuits. The French often serve plain or grated cheese with a dessert of fresh or
dried fruit. At some tables, finger-glasses are placed at the right of each person, nearly
half filled with cold spring water, and in winter with tepid water. These precede the dessert.
At other tables, a glass or vase is simply handed round, filled with perfumed water, into which
each guest dips the corner of his napkin, and, when needful, refreshes his lips and the tips
of his fingers.

After the dishes are placed, and every one is provided with plates, glasses, spoons, &c., the
wine should be put at each end of the table, cooled or otherwise, according to the season.
If the party be small, the wine may be placed only at the top of the table, near the host.

DISH OF NUTS.

1599. These are merely arranged piled high in the centre of the dish, as shown in the engraving,
with or without leaves round the edge. Filberts should always be served with the outer skin
or husk on them; and walnuts should be well wiped with a damp cloth, and then--with a dry one,
to remove the unpleasant sticky feeling the shells frequently have.

Seasonable.--Filberts from September to March, good; may be had after that time, but are generally
shrivelled and dry. Walnuts from September to January.

    HAZEL NUT AND FILBERT.--The common Hazel is the wild, and the
    Filbert the cultivated state of the same tree. The hazel is
    found wild, not only in forests and hedges, in dingles and
    ravines, but occurs in extensive tracts in the more northern and
    mountainous parts of the country. It was formerly one of the
    most abundant of those trees which are indigenous in this
    island. It is seldom cultivated as a fruit-tree, though perhaps
    its nuts are superior in flavour to the others. The Spanish nuts
    imported are a superior kind, but they are somewhat oily and
    rather indigestible. Filberts, both the red and the white, and
    the cob-nut, are supposed to be merely varieties of the common
    hazel, which have been produced, partly by the superiority of
    soil and climate, and partly by culture. They were originally
    brought out of Greece to Italy, whence they have found their way
    to Holland, and from that country to England. It is supposed
    that, within a few miles of Maidstone, in Kent, there are more
    filberts grown than in all England besides; and it is from that
    place that the London market is supplied. The filbert is longer
    than the common nut, though of the same thickness, and has a
    larger kernel. The cob-nut is a still larger variety, and is
    roundish. Filberts are more esteemed at the dessert than common
    nuts, and are generally eaten with salt. They are very free from
    oil, and disagree with few persons.

    WALNUTS.--The Walnut is a native of Persia, the Caucasus, and
    China, but was introduced to this kingdom from France. The ripe
    kernel is brought to the dessert on account of its agreeable
    flavour; and the fruit is also much used in the green state, but
    before the stone hardens, as a pickle. In Spain, grated walnuts
    are employed in tarts and other dishes. The Walnut abounds in
    oil which is expressed and which, being of a highly drying
    nature, and very limpid, is much employed for delicate painting.
    This, on the continent, is sometimes used as a substitute for
    olive-oil in cooking, but is very apt to turn rancid. It is also
    manufactured into a kind of soap. The mare, or refuse matter
    after the oil is extracted, proves very nutritious for poultry
    or other domestic animals. In Switzerland, this is eaten by poor
    people under the name of pain amer.

BOX OF FRENCH PLUMS.

1600. If the box which contains them is exceedingly ornamental, it may be placed on the table;
if small, on a glass dish; if large, without one, French plums may also be arranged on a glass
plate, and garnished with bright-coloured sweetmeats, which make a very good effect. All fancy
boxes of preserved and crystallized fruit may be put on the table or not, at pleasure. These
little matters of detail must, of course, be left to individual taste.

Seasonable.--May be purchased all the year; but are in greater perfection in the winter, and
are more suitable for that season, as fresh fruit cannot be obtained.

DISH OF MIXED FRUIT.

1601. For a centre dish, a mixture of various fresh fruits has a remarkably good effect, particularly
if a pine be added to the list. A high raised appearance should be given to the fruit, which
is done in the following manner. Place a tumbler in the centre of the dish, and, in this tumbler,
the pine, crown uppermost; round the tumbler put a thick layer of moss, and, over this, apples,
pears, plums, peaches, and such fruit as is simultaneously in season. By putting a layer of
moss underneath, so much fruit is not required, besides giving a better shape to the dish.
Grapes should be placed on the top of the fruit, a portion of some of the bunches hanging over
the sides of the dish in a négligé kind of manner, which takes off the formal look of the dish.
In arranging the plums, apples, &c., let the colours contrast well.

Seasonable.--Suitable for a dessert in September or October.

    GRAPES.--France produces about a thousand varieties of the
    grape, which is cultivated more extensively in that country than
    in any other. Hygienists agree in pronouncing grapes as among
    the best of fruits. The grape possesses several rare qualities:
    it is nourishing and fattening, and its prolonged use has often
    overcome the most obstinate cases of constipation. The skins and
    pips of grapes should not be eaten.

BOX OF CHOCOLATE.

1602. This is served in an ornamental box, placed on a glass plate or dish.

Seasonable.--May be purchased at any time.

DISH OF APPLES.

1603. The apples should be nicely wiped with a dry cloth, and arranged on a dish, piled high
in the centre, with evergreen leaves between each layer. The inferior apples should form the
bottom layer, with the bright-coloured large ones at the top. The leaves of the laurel, bay,
holly, or any shrub green in winter, are suitable for garnishing dessert dishes. Oranges may
be arranged in the same manner; they should also be wiped with a dry cloth before being sent
to table.

DISH OF MIXED SUMMER FRUIT.

1604. This dish consists of cherries, raspberries, currants, and strawberries, piled in different
layers, with plenty of leaves between each layer; so that each fruit is well separated. The
fruit should be arranged with a due regard to colour, so that they contrast nicely one with
the other. Our engraving shows a layer of white cherries at the bottom, then one of red raspberries;
over that a layer of white currants, and at the top some fine scarlet strawberries.

Seasonable in June, July, and August.

ALMONDS AND RAISINS.

1605. These are usually served on glass dishes, the fruit piled high in the centre, and the
almonds blanched, and strewn over. To blanch the almonds, put them into a small mug or teacup,
pour over them boiling water, let them remain for 2 or 3 minutes, and the skins may then be
easily removed. Figs, dates, French plums, &c., are all served on small glass plates or oval
dishes, but without the almonds.

Seasonable at any time, but more suitable in winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable.

    DATES.--Dates are imported into Britain, in a dried state, from
    Barbary and Egypt, and, when in good condition, they are much
    esteemed. An inferior kind has lately become common, which are
    dried hard, and have little or no flavour. They should be chosen
    large, softish, not much wrinkled, of a reddish-yellow colour on
    the outside, with a whitish membrane between the fruit and the
    stone.

DISH OF STRAWBERRIES.

1606. Fine strawberries, arranged in the manner shown in the engraving, look exceedingly well.
The inferior ones should be placed at the bottom of the dish, and the others put in rows pyramidically,
with the stalks downwards; so that when the whole is completed, nothing but the red part of
the fruit is visible. The fruit should be gathered with rather long stalks, as there is then
something to support it, and it can be placed more upright in each layer. A few of the finest
should be reserved to crown the top.

TO HAVE WALNUTS FRESH THROUGHOUT THE SEASON.

1607. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of water allow 1 teaspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Place the walnuts in the salt and water for 24 hours at least; then take them out, and
rub them dry. Old nuts may be freshened in this manner; or walnuts, when first picked, may
be put into an earthen pan with salt sprinkled amongst them, and with damped hay placed on
the top of them, and then covered down with a lid. They must be well wiped before they are
put on table.

Seasonable.--Should be stored away in September or October.

CHAPTER XXXII.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS.

MILK.

1608. Milk is obtained only from the class of animals called Mammalia, and is intended by Nature
for the nourishment of their young. The milk of each animal is distinguished by some peculiarities;
but as that of the cow is by far the most useful to us in this part of the world, our observations
will be confined to that variety.

1609. Milk, when drawn from the cow, is of a yellowish-white colour, and is the most yellow
at the beginning of the period of lactation. Its taste is agreeable, and rather saccharine.
The viscidity and specific gravity of milk are somewhat greater than that of water; but these
properties vary somewhat in the milk procured from different individuals. On an average, the
specific gravity of milk is 1.035, water being 1. The small cows of the Alderney breed afford
the richest milk.

1610. Milk which is carried to a considerable distance, so as to be much agitated, and cooled
before it is put into pans to settle for cream, never throws up so much, nor such rich cream,
as if the same milk had been put into pans directly after it was milked.

1611. Milk, considered as an aliment, is of such importance in domestic economy as to render
all the improvements in its production extremely valuable. To enlarge upon the antiquity of
its use is unnecessary; it has always been a favourite food in Britain. "Lacte et carno vivunt,"
says Caesar, in his Commentaries; the English of which is, "the inhabitants subsist upon flesh
and milk." The breed of the cow has received great improvement in modern times, as regards
the quantity and quality of the milk which she affords; the form of milch-cows, their mode
of nourishment, and progress, are also manifest in the management of the dairy.

1612. Although milk in its natural state be a fluid, yet, considered as an aliment, it is both
solid and fluid: for no sooner does it enter the stomach, than it is coagulated by the gastric
juice, and separated into curd and whey, the first of these being extremely nutritive.

1613. Milk of the human subject is much thinner than cow's milk; Ass's milk comes the nearest
to human milk of any other; Goat's milk is something thicker and richer than cow's milk; Ewe's
milk has the appearance of cow's milk, and affords a larger quantity of cream; Mare's milk
contains more sugar than that of the ewe; Camel's milk is used only in Africa; Buffalo's milk
is employed in India.

1614. From no other substance, solid or fluid, can so great a number of distinct kinds of aliment
be prepared as from milk; some forming food, others drink; some of them delicious, and deserving
the name of luxuries; all of them wholesome, and some medicinal: indeed, the variety of aliments
that seems capable of being produced from milk, appears to be quite endless. In every age this
must have been a subject for experiment, and every nation has added to the number by the invention
of some peculiarity of its own.

BUTTER.

1615. BECKMAN, in his "History of Inventions," states that butter was not used either by the
Greeks or Romans in cooking, nor was it brought upon their tables at certain meals, as is the
custom at present. In England it has been made from time immemorial, though the art of making
cheese is said not to have been known to the ancient Britons, and to have been learned from
their conquerors.

1616. The taste of butter is peculiar, and very unlike any other fatty substance. It is extremely
agreeable when of the best quality; but its flavour depends much upon the food given to the
cows: to be good, it should not adhere to the knife.

1617. Butter, with regard to its dietetic properties, may be regarded nearly in the light of
vegetable oils and animal fats; but it becomes sooner rancid than most other fat oils. When
fresh, it cannot but be considered as very wholesome; but it should be quite free from rancidity.
If slightly salted when it is fresh, its wholesomeness is probably not at all impaired; but
should it begin to turn rancid, salting will not correct its unwholesomeness. When salt butter
is put into casks, the upper part next the air is very apt to become rancid, and this rancidity
is also liable to affect the whole cask.

1618. Epping butter is the kind most esteemed in London. Fresh butter comes to London from
Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Yorkshire, Devonshire, &c. Cambridge butter is esteemed
next to fresh; Devonshire butter is nearly similar in quality to the latter; Irish butter sold
in London is all salted, but is generally good. The number of firkins exported annually from
Ireland amounts to 420,000, equal to a million of money. Dutch butter is in good repute all
over Europe, America, and even India; and no country in the world is so successful in the manufacture
of this article, Holland supplying more butter to the rest of the world than any country whatever.

1619. There are two methods pursued in the manufacture of butter. In one, the cream is separated
from the milk, and in that state it is converted into butter by churning, as is the practice
about Epping; in the other, milk is subjected to the same process, which is the method usually
followed in Cheshire. The first method is generally said to give the richest butter, and the
latter the largest quantity, though some are of opinion that there is little difference either
in quality or quantity.

CHEESE.

1620. CHEESE is the curd formed from milk by artificial coagulation, pressed and dried for
use. Curd, called also casein and caseous matter, or the basis of cheese, exists in the milk,
and not in the cream, and requires only to be separated by coagulation. The coagulation, however,
supposes some alteration of the curd. By means of the substance employed to coagulate it, it
is rendered insoluble in water. When the curd is freed from the whey, kneaded and pressed to
expel it entirely, it becomes cheese. This assumes a degree of transparency, and possesses
many of the properties of coagulated albumen. If it be well dried, it does not change by exposure
to the air; but if it contain moisture, it soon putrefies. It therefore requires some salt
to preserve it, and this acts likewise as a kind of seasoning. All our cheese is coloured more
or less, except that made from skim milk. The colouring substances employed are arnatto, turmeric,
or marigold, all perfectly harmless unless they are adulterated; and it is said that arnatto
sometimes contains red lead.

1621. Cheese varies in quality and richness according to the materials of which it is composed.
It is made--1. Of entire milk, as in Cheshire; 2. of milk and cream, as at Stilton; 3. of new
milk mixed with skimmed milk, as in Gloucestershire; 4. of skimmed milk only, as in Suffolk,
Holland, and Italy.

1622. The principal varieties of cheese used in England are the following:--Cheshire cheese,
famed all over Europe for its rich quality and fine piquant flavour. It is made of entire new
milk, the cream not being taken off. Gloucester cheese is much milder in its taste than the
Cheshire. There are two kinds of Gloucester cheese,--single and double. Single Gloucester is
made of skimmed milk, or of the milk deprived of half the cream; Double Gloucester is a cheese
that pleases almost every palate: it is made of the whole milk and cream. Stilton cheese is
made by adding the cream of one day to the entire milk of the next: it was first made at Stilton,
in Leicestershire. Sage cheese is so called from the practice of colouring some curd with bruised
sage, marigold-leaves, and parsley, and mixing this with some uncoloured curd. With the Romans,
and during the middle ages, this practice was extensively adopted. Cheddar cheese much resembles
Parmesan. It has a very agreeable taste and flavour, and has a spongy appearance. Brickbat
cheese has nothing remarkable except its form. It is made by turning with rennet a mixture
of cream and new milk. The curd is put into a wooden vessel the shape of a brick, and is then
pressed and dried in the usual way. Dunlop cheese has a peculiarly mild and rich taste: the
best is made entirely from new milk. New cheese (as it is called in London) is made chiefly
in Lincolnshire, and is either made of all cream, or, like Stilton. by adding the cream of
one day's milking to the milk that comes immediately from the cow: they are extremely thin,
and are compressed gently two or three times, turned for a few days, and then eaten new with
radishes, salad, &c. Skimmed Milk cheese is made for sea voyages principally. Parmesan cheese
is made in Parma and Piacenza. It is the most celebrated of all cheese: it is made entirely
of skimmed cow's milk. The high flavour which it has, is supposed to be owing to the rich herbage
of the meadows of the Po, where the cows are pastured. The best Parmesan is kept for three
or four years, and none is carried to market till it is at least six months old. Dutch cheese
derives its peculiar pungent taste from the practice adopted in Holland of coagulating the
milk with muriatic acid instead of rennet. Swiss cheeses in their several varieties are all
remarkable for their fine flavour. That from Gruyère, a bailiwick in the canton of Fribourg,
is best known in England. It is flavoured by the dried herb of Melilotos officinalis in powder.
Cheese from milk and potatoes is manufactured in Thuringia and Saxony. Cream cheese, although
so called, is not properly cheese, but is nothing more than cream dried sufficiently to be
cut with a knife.

EGGS.

1623. There is only one opinion as to the nutritive properties of eggs, although the qualities
of those belonging to different birds vary somewhat. Those of the common hen are most esteemed
as delicate food, particularly when "new-laid." The quality of eggs depends much upon the food
given to the hen. Eggs in general are considered most easily digestible when little subjected
to the art of cookery. The lightest way of dressing them is by poaching, which is effected
by putting them for a minute or two into brisk boiling water: this coagulates the external
white, without doing the inner part too much. Eggs are much better when new-laid than a day
or two afterwards. The usual time allotted for boiling eggs in the shell is 3 to 3-3/4 minutes:
less time than that in boiling water will not be sufficient to solidify the white, and more
will make the yolk hard and less digestible: it is very difficult to guess accurately as to
the time. Great care should be employed in putting them into the water, to prevent cracking
the shell, which inevitably causes a portion of the white to exude, and lets water into the
egg. Eggs are often beaten up raw in nutritive beverages.

1624. Eggs are employed in a very great many articles of cookery, entrées, and entremets, and
they form an essential ingredient in pastry, creams, flip, &c. It is particularly necessary
that they should be quite fresh, as nothing is worse than stale eggs. Cobbett justly says,
stale, or even preserved eggs, are things to be run from, not after.

1625. The Metropolis is supplied with eggs from all parts of the kingdom, and they are likewise
largely imported from various places on the continent; as France, Holland, Belgium, Guernsey,
and Jersey. It appears from official statements mentioned in McCulloch's "Commercial Dictionary,"
that the number imported from France alone amounts to about 60,000,000 a year; and supposing
them on an average to cost fourpence a dozen, it follows that we pay our continental neighbours
above £83,000 a year for eggs.

1626. The eggs of different birds vary much in size and colour. Those of the ostrich are the
largest: one laid in the menagerie in Paris weighed 2 lbs. 14 oz., held a pint, and was six
inches deep: this is about the usual size of those brought from Africa. Travellers describe
ostrich eggs as of an agreeable taste: they keep longer than hen's eggs. Drinking-cups are
often made of the shell, which is very strong. The eggs of the turkey are almost as mild as
those of the hen; the egg of the goose is large, but well-tasted. Duck's eggs have a rich flavour;
the albumen is slightly transparent, or bluish, when set or coagulated by boiling, which requires
less time than hen's eggs. Guinea-fowl eggs are smaller and more delicate than those of the
hen. Eggs of wild fowl are generally coloured, often spotted; and the taste generally partakes
somewhat of the flavour of the bird they belong to. Those of land birds that are eaten, as
the plover, lapwing, ruff, &c., are in general much esteemed; but those of sea-fowl have, more
or less, a strong fishy taste. The eggs of the turtle are very numerous: they consist of yolk
only, without shell, and are delicious.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

SEPARATION OF MILK AND CREAM.

1627. If it be desired that the milk should be freed entirely from cream, it should be poured
into a very shallow broad pan or dish, not more than 1-1/2 inch deep, as cream cannot rise
through a great depth of milk. In cold and wet weather, milk is not so rich as it is in summer
and warm weather, and the morning's milk is always richer than the evening's. The last-drawn
milk of each milking, at all times and seasons, is richer than the first-drawn, and on that
account should be set apart for cream. Milk should be shaken as little as possible when carried
from the cow to the dairy, and should be poured into the pans very gently. Persons not keeping
cows, may always have a little cream, provided the milk they purchase be pure and unadulterated.
As soon as it comes in, it should be poured into very shallow open pie-dishes, and set by in
a very cool place, and in 7 or 8 hours a nice cream should have risen to the surface.

    MILK is one of the most complete of all articles of food: that
    is to say, it contains a very large number of the elements which
    enter into the composition of the human body. It "disagrees"
    with fat, heavy, languid people, of slow circulation; and, at
    first, with many people of sedentary habits, and stomachs
    weakened by stimulants of different kinds. But, if exercise can
    be taken and a little patience shown, while the system
    accommodates itself to a new regimen, this bland and soothing
    article of diet is excellent for the majority of thin, nervous
    people; especially for those who have suffered much from
    emotional disturbances, or have relaxed their stomachs by too
    much tea or coffee, taken too hot. Milk is, in fact, a nutrient
    and a sedative at once. Stomachs, however, have their
    idiosyncrasies, and it sometimes proves an unwelcome and
    ill-digested article of food. As milk, when good, contains a
    good deal of respiratory material (fat),--material which must
    either be burnt off, or derange the liver, and be rejected in
    other ways, it may disagree because the lungs are not
    sufficiently used in the open air. But it is very probable that
    there are really "constitutions" which cannot take to it; and
    they should not be forced.

TO KEEP MILK AND CREAM IN HOT WEATHER.

1628. When the weather is very warm, and it is very difficult to prevent milk from turning
sour and spoiling the cream, it should be scalded, and it will then remain good for a few hours.
It must on no account be allowed to boil, or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the
milk; and the slower the process, the safer will it be. A very good plan to scald milk, is
to put the pan that contains it into a saucepan or wide kettle of boiling water. When the surface
looks thick, the milk is sufficiently scalded, and it should then be put away in a cool place
in the same vessel that it was scalded in. Cream may be kept for 24 hours, if scalded without
sugar; and by the addition of the latter ingredient, it will remain good double the time, if
kept in a cool place. All pans, jugs, and vessels intended for milk, should be kept beautifully
clean, and well scalded before the milk is put in, as any negligence in this respect may cause
large quantities of it to be spoiled; and milk should never be kept in vessels of zinc or copper.
Milk may be preserved good in hot weather, for a few hours, by placing the jug which contains
it in ice, or very cold water; or a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may be introduced into the liquid.

    MILK, when of good quality, is of an opaque white colour: the
    cream always comes to the top; the well-known milky odour is
    strong; it will boil without altering its appearance, in these
    respects; the little bladders which arise on the surface will
    renew themselves if broken by the spoon. To boil milk is, in
    fact, the simplest way of testing its quality. The commonest
    adulterations of milk are not of a hurtful character. It is a
    good deal thinned with water, and sometimes thickened with a
    little starch, or colored with yolk of egg, or even saffron; but
    these processes have nothing murderous in them.

CURDS AND WHEY.

1629. INGREDIENTS.--A very small piece of rennet, 1/2 gallon of milk.

Mode.--Procure from the butcher's a small piece of rennet, which is the stomach of the calf,
taken as soon as it is killed, scoured, and well rubbed with salt, and stretched on sticks
to dry. Pour some boiling water on the rennet, and let it remain for 6 hours; then use the
liquor to turn the milk. The milk should be warm and fresh from the cow: if allowed to cool,
it must be heated till it is of a degree quite equal to new milk; but do not let it be too
hot. About a tablespoonful or rather more, would be sufficient to turn the above proportion
of milk into curds and whey; and whilst the milk is turning, let it be kept in rather a warm place.

Time.--From 2 to 3 hours to turn the milk.

Seasonable at any time.

DEVONSHIRE CREAM.

1630. The milk should stand 24 hours in the winter, half that time when the weather is very
warm. The milkpan is then set on a stove, and should there remain until the milk is quite hot;
but it must not boil, or there will be a thick skin on the surface. When it is sufficiently
done, the undulations on the surface look thick, and small rings appear. The time required
for scalding cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire; but the slower
it is done, the better. The pan should be placed in the dairy when the cream is sufficiently
scalded, and skimmed the following day. This cream is so much esteemed that it is sent to the
London markets in small square tins, and is exceedingly delicious eaten with fresh fruit. In
Devonshire, butter is made from this cream, and is usually very firm.

DEVONSHIRE JUNKET.

1631. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of new milk allow 2 dessertspoonfuls of brandy, 1 dessertspoonful
of sugar, and 1-1/2 dessertspoonful of prepared rennet; thick cream, pounded cinnamon, or grated
nutmeg.

Mode.--Make the milk blood-warm; put it into a deep dish with the brandy, sugar, and rennet;
stir it altogether, and cover it over until it is set. Then spread some thick or clotted cream
over the top, grate some nutmeg, and strew some sugar over, and the dish will be ready to serve.

Time.--About 2 hours to set the milk. Seasonable at any time.

TO KEEP AND CHOOSE FRESH BUTTER.

1632. Fresh butter should be kept in a dark, cool place, and in as large a mass as possible.
Mould as much only as is required, as the more surface is exposed, the more liability there
will be to spoil; and the outside very soon becomes rancid. Fresh butter should be kept covered
with white paper. For small larders, butter-coolers of red brick are now very much used for
keeping fresh butter in warm weather. These coolers are made with a large bell-shaped cover,
into the top of which a little cold water should be poured, and in summer time very frequently
changed; and the butter must be kept covered. These coolers keep butter remarkably firm in
hot weather, and are extremely convenient for those whose larder accommodation is limited.

In choosing fresh butter, remember it should smell deliciously, and be of an equal colour all
through: if it smells sour, it has not been sufficiently washed from the buttermilk; and if
veiny and open, it has probably been worked with a staler or an inferior sort.

TO PRESERVE AND TO CHOOSE SALT BUTTER.

1633. In large families, where salt butter is purchased a tub at a time, the first thing to
be done is to turn the whole of the butter out, and, with a clean knife, to scrape the outside;
the tub should then be wiped with a clean cloth, and sprinkled all round with salt, the butter
replaced, and the lid kept on to exclude the air. It is necessary to take these precautions,
as sometimes a want of proper cleanliness in the dairymaid causes the outside of the butter
to become rancid, and if the scraping be neglected, the whole mass would soon become spoiled.
To choose salt butter, plunge a knife into it, and if, when drawn out, the blade smells rancid
or unpleasant, the butter is bad. The layers in tubs will vary greatly, the butter being made
at different times; so, to try if the whole tub be good, the cask should be unhooped, and the
butter tried between the staves.

It is not necessary to state that butter is extracted from cream, or from unskimmed milk, by
the churn. Of course it partakes of the qualities of the milk, and winter butter is said not
to be so good as spring butter.

A word of caution is necessary about rancid butter. Nobody eats it on bread, but it is sometimes
used in cooking, in forms in which the acidity can be more or less disguised. So much the worse;
it is almost poisonous, disguise it as you may. Never, under any exigency whatever, be tempted
into allowing butter with even a soupçon of "turning" to enter into the composition of any
dish that appears on your table. And, in general, the more you can do without the employment
of butter that has been subjected to the influence of heat, the better. The woman of modern
times is not a "leech;" but she might often keep the "leech" from the door, if she would give
herself the trouble to invent innocent sauces.

BUTTER-MOULDS, for Moulding Fresh Butter.

1634. Butter-moulds, or wooden stamps for moulding fresh butter, are much used, and are made
in a variety of forms and shapes. In using them, let them be kept scrupulously clean, and before
the butter is pressed in, the interior should be well wetted with cold water; the butter must
then be pressed in, the mould opened, and the perfect shape taken out. The butter may be then
dished, and garnished with a wreath of parsley, if for a cheese course; if for breakfast, put
it into an ornamental butter-dish, with a little water at the bottom, should the weather be
very warm.

CURLED BUTTER.

1635. Tie a strong cloth by two of the corners to an iron hook in the wall; make a knot with
the other two ends, so that a stick might pass through. Put the butter into the cloth; twist
it tightly over a dish, into which the butter will fall through the knot, so forming small
and pretty little strings. The butter may then be garnished with parsley, if to serve with
a cheese course; or it may be sent to table plain for breakfast, in an ornamental dish. Squirted
butter for garnishing hams, salads, eggs, &c., is made by forming a piece of stiff paper in
the shape of a cornet, and squeezing the butter in fine strings from the hole at the bottom.
Scooped butter is made by dipping a teaspoon or scooper in warm water, and then scooping the
butter quickly and thin. In warm weather, it would not be necessary to heat the spoon.

    BUTTER may be kept fresh for ten or twelve days by a very simple
    process. Knead it well in cold water till the buttermilk is
    extracted; then put it in a glazed jar, which invert in another,
    putting into the latter a sufficient quantity of water to
    exclude the air. Renew the water every day.

FAIRY BUTTER.

1636. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1 tablespoonful of orange-flower water,
2 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar, 1/4 lb. of good fresh butter.

Mode.--Beat the yolks of the eggs smoothly in a mortar, with the orange-flower water and the
sugar, until the whole is reduced to a fine paste; add the butter, and force all through an
old but clean cloth by wringing the cloth and squeezing the butter very hard. The butter will
then drop on the plate in large and small pieces, according to the holes in the cloth. Plain
butter may be done in the same manner, and is very quickly prepared, besides having a very
good effect.

    BUTTER.--White-coloured butter is said not to be so good as the
    yellow; but the yellow colour is often artificially produced, by
    the introduction of colouring matter into the churn.

ANCHOVY BUTTER.

1637. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of butter allow 6 anchovies, 1 small bunch of parsley.

Mode.--Wash, bone, and pound the anchovies well in a mortar; scald the parsley, chop it, and
rub through a sieve; then pound all the ingredients together, mix well, and make the butter
into pats immediately. This makes a pretty dish, if fancifully moulded, for breakfast or supper,
and should be garnished with parsley.

Average cost, 1s. 8d.

Sufficient to make 2 dishes, with 4 pats each.

Seasonable at any time.

CHEESE.

1638. In families where much cheese is consumed, and it is bought in large quantities, a piece
from the whole cheese should be cut, the larger quantity spread with a thickly-buttered sheet
of white paper, and the outside occasionally wiped. To keep cheeses moist that are in daily
use, when they come from table a damp cloth should be wrapped round them, and the cheese put
into a pan with a cover to it, in a cool but not very dry place. To ripen cheeses, and bring
them forward, put them into a damp cellar; and, to check too large a production of mites, spirits
may be poured into the parts affected. Pieces of cheese which are too near the rind, or too
dry to put on table, may be made into Welsh rare-bits, or grated down and mixed with macaroni.
Cheeses may be preserved in a perfect state for years, by covering them with parchment made
pliable by soaking in water, or by rubbing them over with a coating of melted fat. The cheeses
selected should be free from cracks or bruises of any kind.

    CHEESE.--It is well known that some persons like cheese in a
    state of decay, and even "alive." There is no accounting for
    tastes, and it maybe hard to show why mould, which is
    vegetation, should not be eaten as well as salad, or maggots as
    well as eels. But, generally speaking, decomposing bodies are
    not wholesome eating, and the line must be drawn somewhere.

STILTON CHEESE.

1639. Stilton cheese, or British Parmesan, as it is sometimes called, is generally preferred
to all other cheeses by those whose authority few will dispute. Those made in May or June are
usually served at Christmas; or, to be in prime order, should be kept from 10 to 12 months,
or even longer. An artificial ripeness in Stilton cheese is sometimes produced by inserting
a small piece of decayed Cheshire into an aperture at the top. From 3 weeks to a month is sufficient
time to ripen the cheese. An additional flavour may also be obtained by scooping out a piece
from the top, and pouring therein port, sherry, Madeira, or old ale, and letting the cheese
absorb these for 2 or 3 weeks. But that cheese is the finest which is ripened without any artificial
aid, is the opinion of those who are judges in these matters. In serving a Stilton cheese,
the top of it should be cut off to form a lid, and a napkin or piece of white paper, with a
frill at the top, pinned round. When the cheese goes from table, the lid should be replaced.

MODE OF SERVING CHEESE.

1640. The usual mode of serving cheese at good tables is to cut a small quantity of it into
neat square pieces, and to put them into a glass cheese-dish, this dish being handed round.
Should the cheese crumble much, of course this method is rather wasteful, and it may then be
put on the table in the piece, and the host may cut from it. When served thus, the cheese must
always be carefully scraped, and laid on a white d'oyley or napkin, neatly folded. Cream cheese
is often served in a cheese course, and, sometimes, grated Parmesan: the latter should he put
into a covered glass dish. Rusks, cheese-biscuits, pats or slices of butter, and salad, cucumber,
or water-cresses, should always form part of a cheese course.

    SMOKING CHEESES.--The Romans smoked their cheeses, to give them
    a sharp taste. They possessed public places expressly for this
    use, and subject to police regulations which no one could evade.

    A celebrated gourmand remarked that a dinner without cheese is
    like a woman with one eye.

CHEESE SANDWICHES.

1641. INGREDIENTS.--Slices of brown bread-and-butter, thin slices of cheese.

Mode.--Cut from a nice fat Cheshire, or any good rich cheese, some slices about 1/2 inch thick,
and place them between some slices of brown bread-and-butter, like sandwiches. Place them on
a plate in the oven, and, when the bread is toasted, serve on a napkin very hot and very quickly.

Time.--10 minutes in a brisk oven.

Average cost, 1-1/2d. each sandwich.

Sufficient.--Allow a sandwich for each person.

Seasonable at any time.

    CHEESE.--One of the most important products of coagulated milk
    is cheese. Unfermented, or cream-cheese, when quite fresh, is
    good for subjects with whom milk does not disagree; but cheese,
    in its commonest shape, is only fit for sedentary people as an
    after-dinner stimulant, and in very small quantity. Bread and
    cheese, as a meal, is only fit for soldiers on march or
    labourers in the open air, who like it because it "holds the
    stomach a long time."

CAYENNE CHEESES.

1642. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of grated cheese, 1/3 teaspoonful
of cayenne, 1/3 teaspoonful of salt; water.

Mode.--Rub the butter in the flour; add the grated cheese, cayenne. and salt; and mix these
ingredients well together. Moisten with sufficient water to make the whole into a paste; roll
out, and cut into fingers about 4 inches in length. Bake them in a moderate oven a very light
colour, and serve very hot.

TO MAKE A FONDUE.

1643. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, the weight of 2 in Parmesan or good Cheshire cheese, the weight
of 2 in butter; pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the former in a basin, and grate
the cheese, or cut it into very thin flakes. Parmesan or Cheshire cheese may be used, whichever
is the most convenient, although the former is considered more suitable for this dish; or an
equal quantity of each may be used. Break the butter into small pieces, add it to the other
ingredients, with sufficient pepper and salt to season nicely, and beat the mixture thoroughly.
Well whisk the whites of the eggs, stir them lightly in, and either bake the fondue in a soufflé-dish
or small round cake-tin. Fill the dish only half full, as the fondue should rise very much.
Pin a napkin round the tin or dish, and serve very hot and very quickly. If allowed to stand
after it is withdrawn from the oven, the beauty and lightness of this preparation will be entirely
spoiled.

BRILLAT SAVARIN'S FONDUE.

(An excellent Recipe.)

1644. INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, cheese, butter, pepper and salt.

Mode.--Take the same number of eggs as there are guests; weigh the eggs in the shell, allow
a third of their weight in Gruyère cheese, and a piece of butter one-sixth of the weight of
the cheese. Break the eggs into a basin, beat them well; add the cheese, which should be grated,
and the butter, which should be broken into small pieces. Stir these ingredients together with
a wooden spoon; put the mixture into a lined saucepan, place it over the fire, and stir until
the substance is thick and soft. Put in a little salt, according to the age of the cheese,
and a good sprinkling of pepper, and serve the fondue on a very hot silver or metal plate.
Do not allow the fondue to remain on the fire after the mixture is set, as, if it boils, it
will be entirely spoiled. Brillat Savarin recommends that some choice Burgundy should he handed
round with this dish. We have given this recipe exactly as he recommends it to be made; but
we have tried it with good Cheshire cheese, and found it answer remarkably well.

Time.--About 4 minutes to set the mixture.

Average cost for 4 persons, 10d.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 egg, with the other ingredients in proportion, for one person.

Seasonable at any time.

MACARONI, as usually served with the CHEESE COURSE.

I.

1645. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of pipe macaroni, 1/4 lb. of butter, 6 oz. of Parmesan or Cheshire
cheese, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of milk, 2 pints of water, bread crumbs.

Mode.--Put the milk and water into a saucepan with sufficient salt to flavour it; place it
on the fire, and, when it boils quickly, drop in the macaroni. Keep the water boiling until
it is quite tender; drain the macaroni, and put it into a deep dish. Have ready the grated
cheese, either Parmesan or Cheshire; sprinkle it amongst the macaroni and some of the butter
cut into small pieces, reserving some of the cheese for the top layer. Season with a little
pepper, and cover the top layer of cheese with some very fine bread crumbs. Warm, without oiling,
the remainder of the butter, and pour it gently over the bread crumbs. Place the dish before
a bright fire to brown the crumbs; turn it once or twice, that it may be equally coloured,
and serve very hot. The top of the macaroni may be browned with a salamander, which is even
better than placing it before the fire, as the process is more expeditious; but it should never
be browned in the oven, as the butter would oil, and so impart a very disagreeable flavour
to the dish. In boiling the macaroni, let it be perfectly tender but firm, no part beginning
to melt, and the form entirely preserved. It may be boiled in plain water, with a little salt
instead of using milk, but should then have a small piece of butter mixed with it.

Time.--1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni, 5 minutes to brown it before the fire.

Note.--Riband macaroni may be dressed in the same manner, but does not require boiling so long
a time.

II.

1646. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of pipe or riband macaroni, 1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 pint of veal
or beef gravy, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, 3 oz. of grated Parmesan or
Cheshire cheese, 1 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Wash the macaroni, and boil it in the gravy and milk until quite tender, without being
broken. Drain it, and put it into rather a deep dish. Beat the yolks of the eggs with the cream
and 2 tablespoonfuls of the liquor the macaroni was boiled in; make this sufficiently hot to
thicken, but do not allow it to boil; pour it over the macaroni, over which sprinkle the grated
cheese and the butter broken into small pieces; brown with a salamander, or before the fire,
and serve.

Average cost, 1s. 2d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

III.

1647. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of pipe macaroni, 1/2 pint of brown gravy No. 436, 6 oz. of grated
Parmesan cheese.

Mode.--Wash the macaroni, and boil it in salt and water until quite tender; drain it, and put
it into rather a deep dish. Have ready a pint of good brown gravy, pour it hot over the macaroni,
and send it to table with grated Parmesan served on a separate dish. When the flavour is liked,
a little pounded mace may be added to the water in which the macaroni is boiled; but this must
always be sparingly added, as it will impart a very strong flavour.

Average cost, with the gravy and cheese, 1s. 3d.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

POUNDED CHEESE.

1648. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of cheese allow 3 oz. of fresh butter.

Mode.--To pound cheese is an economical way of using it, if it has become dry; it is exceedingly
good spread on bread, and is the best way of eating it for those whose digestion is weak. Cut
up the cheese into small pieces, and pound it smoothly in a mortar, adding butter in the above
proportion. Press it down into a jar, cover with clarified butter, and it will keep for several
days. The flavour may be very much increased by adding mixed mustard (about a teaspoonful to
every lb.), or cayenne, or pounded mace. Curry-powder is also not unfrequently mixed with it.

RAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COURSE.

1649. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of Cheshire cheese, 1/4 lb. of Parmesan cheese, 1/4 lb. of fresh
butter, 4 eggs, the crumb of a small roll; pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste.

Mode.--Boil the crumb of the roll in milk for 5 minutes; strain, and put it into a mortar;
add the cheese, which should be finely scraped, the butter, the yolks of the eggs, and seasoning,
and pound these ingredients well together. Whisk the whites of the eggs, mix them with the
paste, and put it into small pans or saucers, which should not be more than half filled. Bake
them from 10 to 12 minutes, and serve them very hot and very quickly. This batter answers equally
well for macaroni after it is boiled tender.

Time--10 to 12 minutes.

PASTRY RAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COURSE.

1650. INGREDIENTS.--Any pieces of very good light puff-paste Cheshire, Parmesan, or Stilton cheese.

Mode.--The remains or odd pieces of paste left from large tarts, &c. answer for making these
little dishes. Gather up the pieces of paste, roll it out evenly, and sprinkle it with grated
cheese of a nice flavour. Fold the paste in three, roll it out again, and sprinkle more cheese
over; fold the paste, roll it out, and with a paste-cutter shape it in any way that may be
desired. Bake the ramakins in a brisk oven from 10 to 15 minutes, dish them on a hot napkin,
and serve quickly. The appearance of this dish may be very much improved by brushing the ramakins
over with yolk of egg before they are placed in the oven. Where expense is not objected to,
Parmesan is the best kind of cheese to use for making this dish.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes. Average cost, with 1/2 lb. of paste, 10d.

Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time.

TOASTED CHEESE, or SCOTCH RARE-BIT.

1651. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of rich cheese, toast, mustard, and pepper.

Mode.--Cut some nice rich sound cheese into rather thin slices; melt it in a cheese-toaster
on a hot plate, or over steam, and, when melted, add a small quantity of mixed mustard and
a seasoning of pepper; stir the cheese until it is completely dissolved, then brown it before
the fire, or with a salamander. Fill the bottom of the cheese-toaster with hot water, and serve
with dry or buttered toasts, whichever may be preferred. Our engraving illustrates a cheese-toaster
with hot-water reservoir: the cheese is melted in the upper tin, which is placed in another
vessel of boiling water, so keeping the preparation beautifully hot. A small quantity of porter,
or port wine, is sometimes mixed with the cheese; and, if it be not very rich, a few pieces
of butter may be mixed with it to great advantage. Sometimes the melted cheese is spread on
the toasts, and then laid in the cheese-dish at the top of the hot water. Whichever way it
is served, it is highly necessary that the mixture be very hot, and very quickly sent to table,
or it will be worthless.

Time.--About 5 minutes to melt the cheese.

Average cost, 1-1/2d. per slice.

Sufficient.--Allow a slice to each person. Seasonable at any time.

TOASTED CHEESE, or WELSH RARE-BIT.

1652. INGREDIENTS.--Slices of bread, butter, Cheshire or Gloucester cheese, mustard, and pepper.

Mode.--Cut the bread into slices about 1/2 inch in thickness; pare off the crust, toast the
bread slightly without hardening or burning it, and spread it with butter. Cut some slices,
not quite so large as the bread, from a good rich fat cheese; lay them on the toasted bread
in a cheese-toaster; be careful that the cheese does not burn, and let it be equally melted.
Spread over the top a little made mustard and a seasoning of pepper, and serve very hot, with
very hot plates. To facilitate the melting of the cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes or
toasted on one side before it is laid on the bread. As it is so essential to send this dish
hot to table, it is a good plan to melt the cheese in small round silver or metal pans, and
to send these pans to table, allowing one for each guest. Slices of dry or buttered toast should
always accompany them, with mustard, pepper, and salt.

Note.--Should the cheese be dry, a little butter mixed with it will be an improvement.

    "COW CHEESE."--It was only fifty years after Aristotle--the
    fourth century before Christ--that butter began to be noticed as
    an aliment. The Greeks, in imitation of the Parthians and
    Scythians, who used to send it to them, had it served upon their
    tables, and called it at first "oil of milk," and later,
    bouturos, "cow cheese."

SCOTCH WOODCOCK.

1653. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of hot buttered toast; allow 1 anchovy to each slice. Have
ready some hot buttered toast, spread with anchovies pounded to a paste; pour a little of the
hot sauce on the top, and serve very hot and very quickly.

Time.--5 minutes to make the sauce hot.

Sufficient.--Allow 1/2 slice to each person. Seasonable at any time.

TO CHOOSE EGGS.

1654. In choosing eggs, apply the tongue to the large end of the egg, and, if it feels warm,
it is new, and may be relied on as a fresh egg. Another mode of ascertaining their freshness
is to hold them before a lighted candle, or to the light, and if the egg looks clear, it will
be tolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and if there is a black spot attached to the shell,
it is worthless. No egg should be used for culinary purposes with the slightest taint in it,
as it will render perfectly useless those with which it has been mixed. Eggs that are purchased,
and that cannot be relied on, should always be broken in a cup, and then put into a basin:
by this means stale or bad eggs may be easily rejected, without wasting the others.

    EGGS contain, for their volume, a greater quantity of nutriment
    than any other article of food. But it does not follow that they
    are always good for weak stomachs; quite the contrary; for it is
    often a great object to give the stomach a large surface to work
    upon, a considerable volume of ingesta, over which the
    nutritive matter is diffused, and so exposed to the action of
    the gastric juice at many points. There are many persons who
    cannot digest eggs, however cooked. It is said, however, that
    their digestibility decreases in proportion to the degree in
    which they are hardened by boiling.

TO KEEP EGGS FRESH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

1655. Have ready a large saucepan, capable of holding 3 or 4 quarts, full of boiling water.
Put the eggs into a cabbage-net, say 20 at a time, and hold them in the water (which must be
kept boiling) for 20 seconds. Proceed in this manner till you have done as many eggs as you
wish to preserve; then pack them away in sawdust. We have tried this method of preserving eggs,
and can vouch for its excellence: they will be found, at the end of 2 or 3 months, quite good
enough for culinary purposes; and although the white may be a little tougher than that of a
new-laid egg, the yolk will be nearly the same. Many persons keep eggs for a long time by smearing
the shells with butter or sweet oil: they should then be packed in plenty of bran or sawdust,
and the eggs not allowed to touch each other. Eggs for storing should be collected in fine
weather, and should not be more than 24 hours old when they are packed away, or their flavour,
when used, cannot be relied on. Another simple way of preserving eggs is to immerse them in
lime-water soon after they have been laid, and then to put the vessel containing the lime-water
in a cellar or cool outhouse.

Seasonable.--The best time for preserving eggs is from July to September.

    EGGS.--The quality of eggs is said to be very much affected by
    the food of the fowls who lay them. Herbs and grain together
    make a better food than grain only. When the hens eat too many
    insects, the eggs have a disagreeable flavour.

TO BOIL EGGS FOR BREAKFAST, SALADS, &c.

1656. Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after they are laid; but rather
a longer time should be allowed for boiling a new-laid egg than for one that is three or four
days old. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water; put the eggs into it gently with a spoon,
letting the spoon touch the bottom of the saucepan before it is withdrawn, that the egg may
not fall, and consequently crack. For those who like eggs lightly boiled, 3 minutes will be
found sufficient; 3-3/4 to 4 minutes will be ample time to set the white nicely; and, if liked
hard, 6 to 7 minutes will not be found too long. Should the eggs be unusually large, as those
of black Spanish fowls sometimes are, allow an extra 1/2 minute for them. Eggs for salads should
be boiled from 10 minutes to 1/4 hour, and should be placed in a basin of cold water for a
few minutes; they should then be rolled on the table with the hand, and the shell will peel
off easily.

Time.--To boil eggs lightly, for invalids or children, 3 minutes; to boil eggs to suit the
generality of tastes, 3-3/4 to 4 minutes; to boil eggs hard, 6 to 7 minutes; for salads, 10
to 15 minutes.

Note.--Silver or plated egg-dishes, like that shown in our engraving, are now very much used.
The price of the one illustrated is £2. 2s., and may be purchased of Messrs. R. & J. Slack,
336, Strand.

    EGGS.--When fresh eggs are dropped into a vessel full of
    boiling water, they crack, because the eggs being well filled,
    the shells give way to the efforts of the interior fluids,
    dilated by heat. If the volume of hot water be small, the shells
    do not crack, because its temperature is reduced by the eggs
    before the interior dilation can take place. Stale eggs, again,
    do not crack, because the air inside is easily compressed.

BUTTERED EGGS.

1657. INGREDIENTS.--4 new-laid eggs, 2 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Procure the eggs new-laid if possible; break them into a basin, and beat them well;
put the butter into another basin, which place in boiling water, and stir till the butter is
melted. Pour that and the eggs into a lined saucepan; hold it over a gentle fire, and, as the
mixture begins to warm, pour it two or three times into the basin, and back again, that the
two ingredients may be well incorporated. Keep stirring the eggs and butter one way until they
are hot, without boiling, and serve on hot buttered toast. If the mixture is allowed to boil,
it will curdle, and so be entirely spoiled.

Time.--About 5 minutes to make the eggs hot. Average cost, 7d.

Sufficient.--Allow a slice to each person. Seasonable at any time.

DUCKS' EGGS.

1658. Ducks' eggs are usually so strongly flavoured that, plainly boiled, they are not good
for eating; they answer, however, very well for various culinary preparations where eggs are
required; such as custards, &c. &c. Being so large and highly-flavoured, 1 duck's egg will
go as far as 2 small hen's eggs; besides making whatever they are mixed with exceedingly rich.
They also are admirable when used in puddings.

    PRIMITIVE METHOD OF COOKING EGGS.--The shepherds of Egypt had a
    singular manner of cooking eggs without the aid of fire. They
    placed them in a sling, which they turned so rapidly that the
    friction of the air heated them to the exact point required for
    use.

FRIED EGGS.

1659. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/4 lb. of lard, butter or clarified dripping.

Mode.--Place a delicately-clean frying-pan over a gentle fire; put in the fat, and allow it
to come to the boiling-point. Break the eggs into cups, slip them into the boiling fat, and
let them remain until the whites are delicately set; and, whilst they are frying, ladle a little
of the fat over them. Take them up with a slice, drain them for a minute from their greasy
moisture, trim them neatly, and serve on slices of fried bacon or ham; or the eggs may be placed
in the middle of the dish, with the bacon put round as a garnish.

Time.--2 to 3 minutes. Average cost, 1d. each; 2d. when scarce.

Sufficient for 2 persons. Seasonable at any time.

    VENERATION FOR EGGS.--Many of the most learned philosophers held
    eggs in a kind of respect, approaching to veneration, because
    they saw in them the emblem of the world and the four elements.
    The shell, they said, represented the earth; the white, water;
    the yolk, fire; and air was found under the shell at one end of
    the egg.

EGGS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.

1660.

Mode.--Put the flour and half the butter into a stewpan; stir them over the fire until the
mixture thickens; pour in the milk, which should be boiling; add a seasoning of pepper and
salt, and simmer the whole for 5 minutes. Put the remainder of the butter into the sauce, and
add the minced parsley; then boil the eggs hard, strip off the shells, cut the eggs into quarters,
and put them on a dish. Bring the sauce to the boiling-point, add the lemon-juice, pour over
the eggs, and serve.

OEUFS AU PLAT, or AU MIROIR, served on the Dish in which they are Cooked.

1661. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Butter a dish rather thickly with good fresh butter; melt it, break the eggs into it
the same as for poaching, sprinkle them with white pepper and fine salt, and put the remainder
of the butter, cut into very small pieces, on the top of them. Put the dish on a hot plate,
or in the oven, or before the fire, and let it remain until the whites become set, but not
hard, when serve immediately, placing the dish they were cooked in on another. To hasten the
cooking of the eggs, a salamander may be held over them for a minute; but great care must be
taken that they are not too much done. This is an exceedingly nice dish, and one very easily
prepared for breakfast.

Time.--3 minutes. Average cost, 5d.

Sufficient for 2 persons. Seasonable at any time.

PLOVERS' EGGS.

1662. Plovers' eggs are usually served boiled hard, and sent to table in a napkin, either hot
or cold. They may also be shelled, and served the same as eggs à la Tripe, with a good Béchamel
sauce, or brown gravy, poured over them. They are also used for decorating salads, the beautiful
colour of the white being generally so much admired.

POACHED EGGS.

1663. INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, water. To every pint of water allow 1 tablespoonful of vinegar.

Mode.--Eggs for poaching should be perfectly fresh, but not quite new-laid; those that are
about 36 hours old are the best for the purpose. If quite new-laid, the white is so milky it
is almost impossible to set it; and, on the other hand, if the egg be at all stale, it is equally
difficult to poach it nicely. Strain some boiling water into a deep clean frying-pan; break
the egg into a cup without damaging the yolk, and, when the water boils, remove the pan to
the side of the fire, and gently slip the egg into it. Place the pan over a gentle fire, and
keep the water simmering until the white looks nicely set, when the egg is ready. Take it up
gently with a slice, cut away the ragged edges of the white, and serve either on toasted bread
or on slices of ham or bacon, or on spinach, &c. A poached egg should not be overdone, as its
appearance and taste will be quite spoiled if the yolk be allowed to harden. When the egg is
slipped into the water, the white should be gathered together, to keep it a little in form,
or the cup should be turned over it for 1 minute. To poach an egg to perfection is rather a
difficult operation; so, for inexperienced cooks, a tin egg-poacher may be purchased, which
greatly facilitates this manner of dressing ecgs. Our illustration clearly shows what it is:
it consists of a tin plate with a handle, with a space for three perforated cups. An egg should
be broken into each cup, and the machine then placed in a stewpan of boiling water, which has
been previously strained. When the whites of the eggs appear set, they are done, and should
then be carefully slipped on to the toast or spinach, or with whatever they are served. In
poaching eggs in a frying-pan, never do more than four at a time; and, when a little vinegar
is liked mixed with the water in which the eggs are done, use the above proportion.

Time.--2-1/2 to 3-1/2 minutes, according to the size of the egg.

Sufficient.--Allow 2 eggs to each person.

Seasonable at any time, but less plentiful in winter.

POACHED EGGS, WITH CREAM.

1664. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 4 teaspoonfuls of vinegar, 4 fresh
eggs, 1/2 gill of cream, salt, pepper, and pounded sugar to taste, 1 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Put the water, vinegar, and salt into a frying-pan, and break each egg into a separate
cup; bring the water, &c. to boil, and slip the eggs gently into it without breaking the yolks.
Simmer them from 3 to 4 minutes, but not longer, and, with a slice, lift them out on to a hot
dish, and trim the edges. Empty the pan of its contents, put in the cream, add a seasoning
to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded sugar; bring the whole to the boiling-point; then add
the butter, broken into small pieces; toss the pan round and round till the butter is melted;
pour it over the eggs, and serve. To insure the eggs not being spoiled whilst the cream, &c.,
is preparing, it is a good plan to warm the cream with the butter, &c., before the eggs are
poached, so that it may be poured over them immediately after they are dished.

Time.--3 to 4 minutes to poach the eggs, 5 minutes to warm the cream.

Average cost for the above quantity, 9d.

Sufficient for 2 persons. Seasonable at any time.

1665. COMPARATIVE SIZES OF EGGS.

SCOTCH EGGS.

1666. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of forcemeat No. 417, hot lard, 1/2 pint of good
brown gravy.

Mode.--Boil the eggs for 10 minutes; strip them from the shells, and cover them with forcemeat
made by recipe No. 417; or substitute pounded anchovies for the ham. Fry the eggs a nice brown
in boiling lard, drain them before the fire from their greasy moisture, dish them, and pour
round from 1/4 to 1/2 pint of good brown gravy. To enhance the appearance of the eggs, they
may be rolled in beaten egg and sprinkled with bread crumbs; but this is scarcely necessary
if they are carefully fried. The flavour of the ham or anchovy in the forcemeat must preponderate,
as it should be very relishing.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the eggs, 5 to 7 minutes to fry them.

EGGS A LA TRIPE.

1667. INGREDIENTS.--8 eggs, 3/4 pint of Béchamel sauce No. 368, dessertspoonful of finely-minced
parsley.

Mode.--Boil the eggs hard; put them into cold water, peel them, take out the yolks whole, and
shred the whites. Make 3/4 pint of Béchamel sauce by recipe No. 368; add the parsley, and,
when the sauce is quite hot, put the yolks of the eggs into the middle of the dish, and the
shred whites round them; pour over the sauce, and garnish with leaves of puff-paste or fried
croûtons. There is no necessity for putting the eggs into the saucepan with the Béchamel; the
sauce, being quite hot, will warm the eggs sufficiently.

Time.--10 minutes to boil the eggs.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES.

BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING.

1668. AMONG the numerous vegetable products yielding articles of food for man, the Cereals
hold the first place. By means of skilful cultivation, mankind have transformed the original
forms of these growths, poor and ill-flavoured as they perhaps were, into various fruitful
and agreeable species, which yield an abundant and pleasant supply. Classified according to
their respective richness in alimentary elements, the Cereals stand thus:--Wheat, and its varieties,
Rye, Barley, Oats, Rice, Indian Corn. Everybody knows it is wheat flour which yields the best
bread. Rye-bread is viscous, hard, less easily soluble by the gastric juice, and not so rich
in nutritive power. Flour produced from barley, Indian corn, or rice, is not so readily made
into bread; and the article, when made, is heavy and indigestible.

1669. On examining a grain of corn from any of the numerous cereals [Footnote: Cereal, a corn-producing
plant; from Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.] used in the preparation of flour, such as wheat,
maize, rye, barley, &c., it will be found to consist of two parts,--the husk, or exterior covering,
which is generally of a dark colour, and the inner, or albuminous part, which is more or less
white. In grinding, these two portions are separated, and the husk being blown away in the
process of winnowing, the flour remains in the form of a light brown powder, consisting principally
of starch and gluten. In order to render it white, it undergoes a process called "bolting."
It is passed through a series of fine sieves, which separate the coarser parts, leaving behind
fine white flour,--the "fine firsts" of the corn-dealer. The process of bolting, as just described,
tends to deprive flour of its gluten, the coarser and darker portion containing much of that
substance; while the lighter part is peculiarly rich in starch. Bran contains a large proportion
of gluten; hence it will be seen why brown broad is so much more nutritious than white; in
fact, we may lay it down as a general rule, that the whiter the bread the less nourishment
it contains. Majendie proved this by feeding a dog for forty days with white wheaten bread,
at the end of which time he died; while another dog, fed on brown bread made with flour mixed
with bran, lived without any disturbance of his health. The "bolting" process, then, is rather
injurious than beneficial in its result; and is one of the numerous instances where fashion
has chosen a wrong standard to go by. In ancient times, down to the Emperors, no bolted flour
was known. In many parts of Germany the entire meal is used; and in no part of the world are
the digestive organs of the people in a better condition. In years of famine, when corn is
scarce, the use of bolted flour is most culpable, for from 18 to 20 per cent, is lost in bran.
Brown bread has, of late years, become very popular; and many physicians have recommended it
to invalids with weak digestions with great success. This rage for white bread has introduced
adulterations of a very serious character, affecting the health of the whole community. Potatoes
are added for this purpose; but this is a comparatively harmless cheat, only reducing the nutritive
property of the bread; but bone-dust and alum are also put in, which are far from harmless.

1670. Bread-making is a very ancient art indeed. The Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks, used
to make bread, in which oil, with aniseed and other spices, was an element; but this was unleavened.
Every family used to prepare the bread for its own consumption, the trade of baking not having
yet taken shape. It is said, that somewhere about the beginning of the thirtieth Olympiad,
the slave of an archon, at Athens, made leavened bread by accident. He had left some wheaten
dough in an earthen pan, and forgotten it; some days afterwards, he lighted upon it again,
and found it turning sour. His first thought was to throw it away; but, his master coming up,
he mixed this now acescent dough with some fresh dough, which he was working at. The bread
thus produced, by the introduction of dough in which alcoholic fermentation had begun, was
found delicious by the archon and his friends; and the slave, being summoned and catechised,
told the secret. It spread all over Athens; and everybody wanting leavened bread at once, certain
persons set up as bread-makers, or bakers. In a short time bread-baking became quite an art,
and "Athenian bread" was quoted all over Greece as the best bread, just as the honey of Hyamettus
was celebrated as the best honey.

1671. In our own times, and among civilized peoples, bread has become an article of food of
the first necessity; and properly so, for it constitutes of itself a complete life-sustainer,
the gluten, starch, and sugar, which it contains, representing azotized and hydro-carbonated
nutrients, and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and vegetable kingdoms in one product.

1672. WHEATEN BREAD.--The finest, wholesomest, and most savoury bread is made from wheaten
flour. There are, of wheat, three leading qualities,-- the soft, the medium, and the hard wheat;
the last of which yields a kind of bread that is not so white as that made from soft wheat,
but is richer in gluten, and, consequently, more nutritive.

1673. RYE BREAD.--This comes next to wheaten bread: it is not so rich in gluten, but is said
to keep fresh longer, and to have some laxative qualities.

1674. BARLEY BREAD, INDIAN-CORN BREAD, &c.--Bread made from barley, maize, oats, rice, potatoes,
&c. "rises" badly, because the grains in question contain but little gluten, which makes the
bread heavy, close in texture, and difficult of digestion; in fact, corn-flour has to be added
before panification can take place. In countries where wheat is scarce and maize abundant,
the people make the latter a chief article of sustenance, when prepared in different forms.

BREAD-MAKING.

1675. PANIFICATION, or bread-making, consists of the following processes, in the case of Wheaten
Flour. Fifty or sixty per cent. of water is added to the flour, with the addition of some leavening
matter, and, preferably, of yeast from malt and hops. All kinds of leavening matter have, however,
been, and are still used in different parts of the world: in the East Indies, "toddy," which
is a liquor that flows from the wounded cocoa-nut tree; and, in the West Indies, "dunder,"
or the refuse of the distillation of rum. The dough then undergoes the well-known process called
kneading. The yeast produces fermentation, a process which may be thus described:--The dough
reacting upon the leavening matter introduced, the starch of the flour is transformed into
saccharine matter, the saccharine matter being afterwards changed into alcohol and carbonic
acid. The dough must be well "bound," and yet allow the escape of the little bubbles of carbonic
acid which accompany the fermentation, and which, in their passage, cause the numerous little
holes which are seen in light bread.

1676. The yeast must be good and fresh, if the bread is to be digestible and nice. Stale yeast
produces, instead of vinous fermentation, an acetous fermentation, which flavours the bread
and makes it disagreeable. A poor thin yeast produces an imperfect fermentation, the result
being a heavy unwholesome loaf.

1677. When the dough is well kneaded, it is left to stand for some time, and then, as soon
as it begins to swell, it is divided into loaves; after which it is again left to stand, when
it once more swells up, and manifests, for the last time, the symptoms of fermentation. It
is then put into the oven, where the water contained in the dough is partly evaporated, and
the loaves swell up again, while a yellow crust begins to form upon the surface. When the bread
is sufficiently baked, the bottom crust is hard and resonant if struck with the finger, while
the crumb is elastic, and rises again after being pressed down with the finger. The bread is,
in all probability, baked sufficiently if, on opening the door of the oven, you are met by
a cloud of steam which quickly passes away.

1678. One word as to the unwholesomeness of new bread and hot rolls. When bread is taken out
of the oven, it is full of moisture; the starch is held together in masses, and the bread,
instead of being crusted so as to expose each grain of starch to the saliva, actually prevents
their digestion by being formed by the teeth into leathery poreless masses, which lie on the
stomach like so many bullets. Bread should always be at least a day old before it is eaten;
and, if properly made, and kept in a cool dry place, ought to be perfectly soft and palatable
at the end of three or four days. Hot rolls, swimming in melted butter, and new bread, ought
to be carefully shunned by everybody who has the slightest respect for that much-injured individual--the
Stomach.

1679. AERATED BREAD.--It is not unknown to some of our readers that Dr. Dauglish, of Malvern,
has recently patented a process for making bread "light" without the use of leaven. The ordinary
process of bread-making by fermentation is tedious, and much labour of human hands is requisite
in the kneading, in order that the dough may be thoroughly interpenetrated with the leaven.
The new process impregnates the bread, by the application of machinery, with carbonic acid
gas, or fixed air. Different opinions are expressed about the bread; but it is curious to note,
that, as corn is now reaped by machinery, and dough is baked by machinery, the whole process
of bread-making is probably in course of undergoing changes which will emancipate both the
housewife and the professional baker from a large amount of labour.

1680. In the production of Aërated Bread, wheaten flour, water, salt, and carbonic acid gas
(generated by proper machinery), are the only materials employed. We need not inform our readers
that carbonic acid gas is the source of the effervescence, whether in common water coming from
a depth, or in lemonade, or any aërated drink. Its action, in the new bread, takes the place
of fermentation in the old.

1681. In the patent process, the dough is mixed in a great iron ball, inside which is a system
of paddles, perpetually turning, and doing the kneading part of the business. Into this globe
the flour is dropped till it is full, and then the common atmospheric air is pumped out, and
the pure gas turned on. The gas is followed by the water, which has been aërated for the purpose,
and then begins the churning or kneading part of the business.

1682. Of course, it is not long before we have the dough, and very "light" and nice it looks.
This is caught in tins, and passed on to the floor of the oven, which is an endless floor,
moving slowly through the fire. Done to a turn, the loaves emerge at the other end of the apartment,--and
the Aërated Bread is made.

1683. It may be added, that it is a good plan to change one's baker from time to time, and
so secure a change in the quality of the bread that is eaten.

1684. MIXED BREADS.--Rye bread is hard of digestion, and requires longer and slower baking
than wheaten bread. It is better when made with leaven of wheaten flour rather than yeast,
and turns out lighter. It should not be eaten till two days old. It will keep a long time.

1685. A good bread may be made by mixing rye-flour, wheat-flour, and rice-paste in equal proportions;
also by mixing rye, wheat, and barley. In Norway, it is said that they only bake their barley
broad once a year, such is its "keeping" quality.

1686. Indian-corn flour mixed with wheat-flour (half with half) makes a nice bread; but it
is not considered very digestible, though it keeps well.

1687. Rice cannot be made into bread, nor can potatoes; but one-third potato flour to three-fourths
wheaten flour makes a tolerably good loaf.

1688. A very good bread, better than the ordinary sort, and of a delicious flavour, is said
to be produced by adopting the following recipe:--Take ten parts of wheat-flour, five parts
of potato-flour, one part of rice-paste; knead together, add the yeast, and bake as usual.
This is, of course, cheaper than wheaten bread.

1689. Flour, when freshly ground, is too glutinous to make good bread, and should therefore
not be used immediately, but should be kept dry for a few weeks, and stirred occasionally,
until it becomes dry, and crumbles easily between the fingers.

1690. Flour should be perfectly dry before being used for bread or cakes; if at all damp, the
preparation is sure to be heavy. Before mixing it with the other ingredients, it is a good
plan to place it for an hour or two before the fire, until it feels warm and dry.

1691. Yeast from home-brewed beer is generally preferred to any other: it is very bitter, and,
on that account, should be well washed, and put away until the thick mass settles. If it still
continues bitter, the process should be repeated; and, before being used, all the water floating
at the top must be poured off. German yeast is now very much used, and should be moistened,
and thoroughly mixed with the milk or water with which the bread is to be made.

1692. The following observations are extracted from a valuable work on Bread-making, [Footnote:
"The English Bread-Book." By Eliza Acton. London: Longman.] and will be found very useful to
our readers:--

1693. The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost cleanliness; the next
is the soundness and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it; and, in addition to these,
there must be attention and care through the whole process.

1694. An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half-made, and to allow it to
become cold before it is finished. The other most common causes of failure are using yeast
which is no longer sweet, or which has been frozen, or has had hot liquid poured over it.

1695. Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient time allowed for the dough to rise,
will cause the bread to be heavy.

1696. Heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the dough very hard, and letting
it become quite, cold, particularly in winter.

1697. If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself, that is to say, if
the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has reached the proper point for either, sour
bread will probably be the consequence in warm weather, and bad bread in any. The goodness
will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of it hot, instead
of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation.

1698. MILK OR BUTTER.--Milk which is not perfectly sweet will not only injure the flavour of
the bread, but, in sultry weather, will often cause it to be quite uneatable; yet either of
them, if fresh and good, will materially improve its quality.

1699. To keep bread sweet and fresh, as soon as it is cold it should be put into a clean earthen
pan, with a cover to it: this pan should be placed at a little distance from the ground, to
allow a current of air to pass underneath. Some persons prefer keeping bread on clean wooden
shelves, without being covered, that the crust may not soften. Stale bread may be freshened
by warming it through in a gentle oven. Stale pastry, cakes, &c., may also be improved by this
method.

1700. The utensils required for making bread, on a moderate scale, are a kneading-trough or
pan, sufficiently large that the dough may be kneaded freely without throwing the flour over
the edges, and also to allow for its rising; a hair sieve for straining yeast, and one or two
strong spoons.

1701. Yeast must always be good of its kind, and in a fitting state to produce ready and proper
fermentation. Yeast of strong beer or ale produces more effect than that of milder kinds; and
the fresher the yeast, the smaller the quantity will be required to raise the dough.

1702. As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather quick, and the heat so
regulated as to penetrate the dough without hardening the outside. The oven door should not
be opened after the bread is put in until the dough is set, or has become firm, as the cool
air admitted will have an unfavourable effect on it.

1703. Brick ovens are generally considered the best adapted for baking bread: these should
be heated with wood faggots, and then swept and mopped out, to cleanse them for the reception
of the bread. Iron ovens are more difficult to manage, being apt to burn the surface of the
bread before the middle is baked. To remedy this, a few clean bricks should be set at the bottom
of the oven, close together, to receive the tins of bread. In many modern stoves the ovens
are so much improved that they bake admirably; and they can always be brought to the required
temperature, when it is higher than is needed, by leaving the door open for a time.

A FEW HINTS respecting the Making and Baking of CAKES.

1704. Eggs should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks separated, and they should
always be strained. Breaking the eggs thus, the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling
the others, and so cause no waste. As eggs are used instead of yeast, they should be very thoroughly
whisked; they are generally sufficiently beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that falls
from the whisk.

1705. Loaf Sugar should be well pounded, and then sifted through a fine sieve.

1706. Currants should be nicely washed, picked, dried in a cloth, and then carefully examined,
that no pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them. They should then be laid on a dish
before the fire, to become thoroughly dry; as, if added damp to the other ingredients, cakes
will be liable to be heavy.

1707. Good Butter should always be used in the manufacture of cakes; and if beaten to a cream,
it saves much time and labour to warm, but not melt, it before beating.

1708. Less butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed with the other ingredients.

1709. The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for large cakes. If the heat
be not tolerably fierce, the batter will not rise. If the oven is too quick, and there is any
danger of the cake burning or catching, put a sheet of clean paper over the top. Newspaper,
or paper that has been printed on, should never be used for this purpose.

1710. To know when a cake is sufficiently baked, plunge a clean knife into the middle of it;
draw it quickly out, and if it looks in the least sticky, put the cake back, and close the
oven door until the cake is done.

1711. Cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or jars, and in a dry place. Those made
with yeast do not keep so long as those made without it.

BISCUITS.

1712. Since the establishment of the large modern biscuit manufactories, biscuits have been
produced both cheap and wholesome, in, comparatively speaking, endless variety. Their actual
component parts are, perhaps, known only to the various makers; but there are several kinds
of biscuits which have long been in use, that may here be advantageously described.

1713. Biscuits belong to the class of unfermented bread, and are, perhaps, the most wholesome
of that class. In cases where fermented bread does not agree with the human stomach, they may
be recommended: in many instances they are considered lighter, and less liable to create acidity
and flatulence. The name is derived from the French bis cuit, "twice-baked," because, originally,
that was the mode of entirely depriving them of all moisture, to insure their keeping; but,
although that process is no longer employed, the name is retained. The use of this kind of
bread on land is pretty general, and some varieties are luxuries; but, at sea, biscuits are
articles of the first necessity.

1714. SEA, or SHIP BISCUITS, are made of wheat-flour from which only the coarsest bran has
been separated. The dough is made up as stiff as it can be worked, and is then formed into
shapes, and baked in an oven; after which, the biscuits are exposed in lofts over the oven
until perfectly dry, to prevent them from becoming mouldy when stored.

1715. CAPTAINS' BISCUITS are made in a similar manner, only of fine flour.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXXV.

TO MAKE YEAST FOR BREAD.

1716. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of hops, 3 quarts of water, 1 lb. of bruised malt, 1/2 pint of yeast.

Mode.--Boil the hops in the water for 20 minutes; let it stand for about 5 minutes, then add
it to 1 lb. of bruised malt prepared as for brewing. Let the mixture stand covered till about
lukewarm; then put in not quite 1/2 pint of yeast; keep it warm, and let it work 3 or 4 hours;
then put it into small 1/2-pint bottles (ginger-beer bottles are the best for the purpose),
cork them well, and tie them down. The yeast is now ready for use; it will keep good for a
few weeks, and 1 bottle will be found sufficient for 18 lbs. of flour. When required for use,
boil 3 lbs. of potatoes without salt, mash them in the same water in which they were boiled,
and rub them through a colander. Stir in about 1/2 lb. of flour; then put in the yeast, pour
it in the middle of the flour, and let it stand warm on the hearth all night, and in the morning
let it be quite warm when it is kneaded. The bottles of yeast require very careful opening,
as it is generally exceedingly ripe.

Time.--20 minutes to boil the hops and water, the yeast to work 3 or 4 hours.

Sufficient.--1/2 pint sufficient for 18 lbs. of flour.

KIRKLEATHAM YEAST.

1717. Bottle it up, and tie the corks down. When wanted for use, boil potatoes according to
the quantity of bread to be made (about 3 lbs. are sufficient for about a peck of flour); mash
them, add to them 1/2 lb. of flour, and mix about 1/2 pint of the yeast with them; let this
mixture stand all day, and lay the bread to rise the night before it is wanted.

Time.--20 minutes to boil the hops and water.

Sufficient.--1/2 pint of this yeast sufficient for a peck of flour, or rather more.

TO MAKE GOOD HOME-MADE BREAD.

(Miss Acton's Recipe.)

1718. INGREDIENTS.--1 quartern of flour, 1 large tablespoonful of solid brewer's yeast, or
nearly 1 oz. of fresh German yeast, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 pint of warm milk-and-water.

Mode.--Put the flour into a large earthenware bowl or deep pan; then, with a strong metal or
wooden spoon, hollow out the middle; but do not clear it entirely away from the bottom of the
pan, as, in that case, the sponge (or leaven, as it was formerly termed) would stick to it,
which it ought not to do. Next take either a large tablespoonful of brewer's yeast which has
been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water, and letting it afterwards stand
to settle for a day and night; or nearly an ounce of German yeast; put it into a large basin,
and proceed to mix it, so that it shall be as smooth as cream, with 3/4 pint of warm milk-and-water,
or with water only; though even a very little milk will much improve the bread. Pour the yeast
into the hole made in the flour, and stir into it as much of that which lies round it as will
make a thick batter, in which there must be no lumps. Strew plenty of flour on the top; throw
a thick clean cloth over, and set it where the air is warm; but do not place it upon the kitchen
fender, for it will become too much heated there. Look at it from time to time: when it has
been laid for nearly an hour, and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flour, so
that bubbles appear in it, you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough. Then place
the pan on a strong chair, or dresser, or table, of convenient height; pour into the sponge
the remainder of the warm milk-and-water; stir into it as much of the flour as you can with
the spoon; then wipe it out clean with your fingers, and lay it aside. Next take plenty of
the remaining flour, throw it on the top of the leaven, and begin, with the knuckles of both
hands, to knead it well. When the flour is nearly all kneaded in, begin to draw the edges of
the dough towards the middle, in order to mix the whole thoroughly; and when it is free from
flour and lumps and crumbs, and does not stick to the hands when touched, it will be done,
and may again be covered with the cloth, and left to rise a second time. In 3/4 hour look at
it, and should it have swollen very much, and begin to crack, it will be light enough to bake.
Turn it then on to a paste-board or very clean dresser, and with a large sharp knife divide
it in two; make it up quickly into loaves, and dispatch it to the oven: make one or two incisions
across the tops of the loaves, as they will rise more easily if this be done. If baked in tins
or pans, rub them with a tiny piece of butter laid on a piece of clean paper, to prevent the
dough from sticking to them. All bread should be turned upside down, or on its side, as soon
as it is drawn from the oven: if this be neglected, the under part of the loaves will become
wet and blistered from the steam, which cannot then escape from them. To make the dough without
setting a sponge, merely mix the yeast with the greater part of the warm milk-and-water, and
wet up the whole of the flour at once after a little salt has been stirred in, proceeding exactly,
in every other respect, as in the directions just given. As the dough will soften in the rising,
it should be made quite firm at first, or it will be too lithe by the time it is ready for
the oven.

Time.--To be left to rise an hour the first time, 3/4 hour the second time; to be baked from
1 to 1-1/4 hour, or baked in one loaf from 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

    ITALIAN MILLET, or Great Indian Millet, is cultivated in Egypt
    and Nubia, where it is called dhourra, and is used as human
    food, as well as for the fermentation of beer. It will grow on
    poor soils, and is extremely productive. It has been introduced
    into Italy, where they make a coarse bread from it; and it is
    also employed in pastry and puddings: they also use it for
    feeding horses and domestic fowls. It is the largest variety,
    growing to the height of six feet; but it requires a warm
    climate, and will not ripen in this country. A yellow variety,
    called Golden Millet, is sold in the grocers' shops, for making
    puddings, and is very delicate and wholesome.

TO MAKE A PECK OF GOOD BREAD.

1719. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of potatoes, 6 pints of cold water, 1/2 pint of good yeast, a peck
of flour, 2 oz. of salt.

Mode.--Peel and boil the potatoes; beat them to a cream while warm; then add 1 pint of cold
water, strain through a colander, and add to it 1/2 pint of good yeast, which should have been
put in water over-night, to take off its bitterness. Stir all well together with a wooden spoon,
and pour the mixture into the centre of the flour; mix it to the substance of cream, cover
it over closely, and let it remain near the fire for an hour; then add the 5 pints of water,
milk-warm, with 2 oz. of salt; pour this in, and mix the whole to a nice light dough. Let it
remain for about 2 hours; then make it into 7 loaves, and bake for about 1-1/2 hour in a good
oven. When baked, the bread should weigh nearly 20 lbs.

Time.--About 1-1/2 hour.

    THE RED VARIETIES OF WHEAT are generally hardier and more easily
    grown than the white sorts, and, although of less value to the
    miller, they are fully more profitable to the grower, in
    consequence of the better crops which they produce. Another
    advantage the red wheats possess is their comparative immunity
    from the attacks of mildew and fly. The best English wheat comes
    from the counties of Kent and Essex; the qualities under these
    heads always bearing a higher price than others, as will be seen
    by the periodical lists in the journals.

RICE BREAD.

1720. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of rice allow 4 lbs. of wheat flour, nearly 3 tablespoonfuls
of yeast, 1/4 oz. of salt. Mode.--Boil the rice in water until it is quite tender; pour off
the water, and put the rice, before it is cold, to the flour. Mix these well together with
the yeast, salt, and sufficient warm water to make the whole into a smooth dough; let it rise
by the side of the fire, then form it into loaves, and bake them from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, according
to their size. If the rice is boiled in milk instead of water, it makes very delicious bread
or cakes. When boiled in this manner, it may be mixed with the flour without straining the
liquid from it. Time.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.

INDIAN-CORN-FLOUR BREAD.

1721. INGREDIENTS.--To 4 lbs. of flour allow 2 lbs. of Indian-corn flour, 2 tablespoonfuls
of yeast, 3 pints of warm water, 1/4 oz. of salt. Mode.--Mix the two flours well together,
with the salt; make a hole in the centre, and stir the yeast up well with 1/2 pint of the warm
water; put this into the middle of the flour, and mix enough of it with the yeast to make a
thin batter; throw a little flour over the surface of this batter, cover the whole with a thick
cloth, and set it to rise in a warm place. When the batter has nicely risen, work the whole
to a nice smooth dough, adding the water as required; knead it well, and mould the dough into
loaves; let them rise for nearly 1/2 hour, then put them into a well-heated oven. If made into
2 loaves, they will require from 1-1/2 to 2 hours baking.

Time.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.

    MAIZE.--Next to wheat and rice, maize is the grain most used in
    the nourishment of man. In Asia, Africa, and America, it is the
    principal daily food of a large portion of the population,
    especially of the colonists. In some of the provinces of France,
    too, it is consumed in large quantities. There are eight
    varieties of the maize; the most productive is the maize of
    Cusco. The flour of maize is yellow, and it contains an oily
    matter, which, when fresh, gives it an agreeable flavour and
    odour; but the action of the air on it soon develops rancidity.
    If carried any distance, it should be stored away in air-tight
    vessels. An excellent soup is prepared with meat and
    maize-flour. The inhabitants of some countries, where wheat is
    scarce, make, with maize and water, or milk and salt, a kind of
    biscuit, which is pleasant in taste, but indigestible. Some of
    the preparations of maize-flour are very good, and, when
    partaken in moderation, suitable food for almost everybody.

SODA BREAD.

1722. INGREDIENTS.--To every 2 lbs. of flour allow 1 teaspoonful of tartaric acid, 1 teaspoonful
of salt, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, 2 breakfast-cupfuls of cold milk.

Mode.--Let the tartaric acid and salt be reduced to the finest possible powder; then mix them
well with the flour. Dissolve the soda in the milk, and pour it several times from one basin
to another, before adding it to the flour. Work the whole quickly into a light dough, divide
it into 2 loaves, and put them into a well-heated oven immediately, and bake for an hour. Sour
milk or buttermilk may be used, but then a little less acid will be needed.

Time.--1 hour.

    POLISH AND POMERANIAN WHEAT are accounted by authorities most
    excellent. Large raft-like barges convey this grain down the
    rivers, from the interior of the country to the seaports. This
    corn is described as being white, hard, and thin-skinned; and it
    yields a large quantity of flour, having a small proportion of
    bran.

EXCELLENT ROLLS.

1723. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1 oz. of butter, 1/4 pint of milk, 1 large
teaspoonful of yeast, a little salt.

Mode.--Warm the butter in the milk, add to it the yeast and salt, and mix these ingredients
well together. Put the flour into a pan, stir in the above ingredients, and let the dough rise,
covered in a warm place. Knead it well, make it into rolls, let them rise again for a few minutes,
and bake in a quick oven. Richer rolls may be made by adding 1 or 2 eggs and a larger proportion
of butter, and their appearance improved by brushing the tops over with yolk of egg or a little
milk.

Time--1 lb. of flour, divided into 6 rolls, from 15 to 20 minutes.

HOT ROLLS.

1724. This dish, although very unwholesome and indigestible, is nevertheless a great favourite,
and eaten by many persons. As soon as the rolls come from the baker's, they should be put into
the oven, which, in the early part of the morning, is sure not to be very hot; and the rolls
must not be buttered until wanted. When they are quite hot, divide them lengthwise into three;
put some thin flakes of good butter between the slices, press the rolls together, and put them
in the oven for a minute or two, but not longer, or the butter would oil; take them out of
the oven, spread the butter equally over, divide the rolls in half, and put them on to a very
hot clean dish, and send them instantly to table.

TO MAKE DRY TOAST.

1725. To make dry toast properly, a great deal of attention is required; much more, indeed,
than people generally suppose. Never use new bread for making any kind of toast, as it eats
heavy, and, besides, is very extravagant. Procure a loaf of household bread about two days
old; cut off as many slices as may be required, not quite 1/4 inch in thickness; trim off the
crusts and ragged edges, put the bread on a toasting-fork, and hold it before a very clear
fire. Move it backwards and forwards until the bread is nicely coloured; then turn it and toast
the other side, and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens. Dry toast should be
more gradually made than buttered toast, as its great beauty consists in its crispness, and
this cannot be attained unless the process is slow and the bread is allowed gradually to colour.
It should never be made long before it is wanted, as it soon becomes tough, unless placed on
the fender in front of the fire. As soon as each piece is ready, it should be put into a rack,
or stood upon its edges, and sent quickly to table.

TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST.

1726. A loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage
bread, the latter not being a good shape, and too crusty for the purpose. Cut as many nice
even slices as may be required, rather more than 1/4 inch in thickness, and toast them before
a very bright fire, without allowing the bread to blacken, which spoils the appearance and
flavour of all toast. When of a nice colour on both sides, put it on a hot plate; divide some
good butter into small pieces, place them on the toast, set this before the fire, and when
the butter is just beginning to melt, spread it lightly over the toast. Trim off the crust
and ragged edges, divide each round into 4 pieces, and send the toast quickly to table. Some
persons cut the slices of toast across from corner to corner, so making the pieces of a three-cornered
shape. Soyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it is buttered,
and when all are ready, that they should be piled lightly on the dish they are intended to
be served on. He says that by cutting through 4 or 5 slices at a time, all the butter is squeezed
out of the upper ones, while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid. It is highly essential
to use good butter for making this dish.

MUFFINS.

1727. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of milk allow 1-1/2 oz. of German yeast, a little salt; flour.

Mode.--Warm the milk, add to it the yeast, and mix these well together; put them into a pan,
and stir in sufficient flour to make the whole into a dough of rather a soft consistence; cover
it over with a cloth, and place it in a warm place to rise, and, when light and nicely risen,
divide the dough into pieces, and round them to the proper shape with the hands; place them,
in a layer of flour about two inches thick, on wooden trays, and let them rise again; when
this is effected, they each will exhibit a semi-globular shape. Then place them carefully on
a hot-plate or stove, and bake them until they are slightly browned, turning them when they
are done on one side. Muffins are not easily made, and are more generally purchased than manufactured
at home. To toast them, divide the edge of the muffin all round, by pulling it open, to the
depth of about an inch, with the fingers. Put it on a toasting-fork, and hold it before a very
clear fire until one side is nicely browned, but not burnt; turn, and toast it on the other.
Do not toast them too quickly, as, if this is done, the middle of the muffin will not be warmed
through. When done, divide them by pulling them open; butter them slightly on both sides, put
them together again, and cut them into halves: when sufficient are toasted and buttered, pile
them on a very hot dish, and send them very quickly to table.

Time.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to bake them.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 muffin to each person.

CRUMPETS.

1728. These are made in the same manner as muffins; only, in making the mixture, let it be
more like batter than dough. Let it rise for about 1/2 hour; pour it into iron rings, which
should be ready on a hot-plate; bake them, and when one side appears done, turn them quickly
on the other. To toast them, have ready a very bright clear fire; put the crumpet on a toasting-fork,
and hold it before the fire, not too close, until it is nicely brown on one side, but do not
allow it to blacken. Turn it, and brown the other side; then spread it with good butter, cut
it in half, and, when all are done, pile them on a hot dish, and send them quickly to table.
Muffins and crumpets should always be served on separate dishes, and both toasted and served
as expeditiously as possible.

Time.--From 10 to 15 minutes to bake them.

Sufficient.--Allow 2 crumpets to each person.

PLAIN BUNS.

1729. INGREDIENTS.--To every 2 lbs. of flour allow 6 oz. of moist sugar, 1/2 gill of yeast,
1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 lb. of butter, warm milk.

Mode.--Put the flour into a basin, mix the sugar well with it, make a hole in the centre, and
stir in the yeast and milk (which should be lukewarm), with enough of the flour to make it
the thickness of cream. Cover the basin over with a cloth, and let the sponge rise in a warm
place, which will be accomplished in about 1-1/2 hour. Melt the butter, but do not allow it
to oil; stir it into the other ingredients, with enough warm milk to make the whole into a
soft dough; then mould it into buns about the size of an egg; lay them in rows quite 3 inches
apart; set them again in a warm place, until they have risen to double their size; then put
them into a good brisk oven, and just before they are done, wash them over with a little milk.
From 15 to 20 minutes will be required to bake them nicely. These buns may be varied by adding
a few currants, candied peel, or caraway seeds to the other ingredients; and the above mixture
answers for hot cross buns, by putting in a little ground allspice; and by pressing a tin mould
in the form of a cross in the centre of the bun.

Time.--15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, 1d. each.

Sufficient to make 18 buns.

TO MAKE GOOD PLAIN BUNS.

1730. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of good butter, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1 egg, nearly 1/4
pint of milk, 2 small teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, a few drops of essence of lemon.

Mode.--Warm the butter, without oiling it; beat it with a wooden spoon; stir the flour in gradually
with the sugar, and mix these ingredients well together. Make the milk lukewarm, beat up with
it the yolk of the egg and the essence of lemon, and stir these to the flour, &c. Add the baking-powder,
beat the dough well for about 10 minutes, divide it into 24 pieces, put them into buttered
tins or cups, and bake in a brisk oven from 20 to 30 minutes.

Time.--20 to 30 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient to make 12 buns. Seasonable at any time.

LIGHT BUNS.

1731. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 teaspoonful of tartaric acid, 1/2 teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda,
1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of loaf sugar, 1/4 lb. of currants or raisins,--when
liked, a few caraway seeds, 1/2 pint of cold new milk, 1 egg.

Mode.--Rub the tartaric acid, soda, and flour all together through a hair sieve; work the butter
into the flour; add the sugar, currants, and caraway seeds, when the flavour of them latter
is liked. Mix all these ingredients well together; make a hole in the middle of the flour,
and pour in the milk, mixed with the egg, which should be well beaten; mix quickly, and set
the dough, with a fork, on baking-tins, and bake the buns for about 20 minutes. This mixture
makes a very good cake, and if put into a tin, should be baked 1-1/2 hour. The same quantity
of flour, soda, and tartaric acid, with 1/2 pint of milk and a little salt, will make either
bread or teacakes, if wanted quickly.

Time.--20 minutes for the buns; if made into a cake, 1-1/2 hour.

Sufficient to make about 12 buns.

VICTORIA BUNS.

1732. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of pounded loaf sugar, 1 egg, 1-1/2 oz. of ground rice, 2 oz. of
butter, 1-1/2 oz. of currants, a few thin slices of candied peel; flour.

Mode.--Whisk the egg, stir in the sugar, and beat these ingredients well together; beat the
butter to a cream, stir in the ground rice, currants, and candied peel, and as much flour as
will make it of such a consistency that it may be rolled into 7 or 8 balls. Put these on to
a buttered tin, and bake them from 1/2 to 3/4 hour. They should be put into the oven immediately,
or they will become heavy; and the oven should be tolerably brisk.

Sufficient to make 7 or 8 buns. Seasonable at any time.

ITALIAN RUSKS.

1733. A stale Savoy or lemon cake may be converted into very good rusks in the following manner.
Cut the cake into slices, divide each slice in two; put them on a baking-sheet, in a slow oven,
and when they are of a nice brown and quite hard, they are done. They should be kept in a closed
tin canister in a dry place, to preserve their crispness.

    PANNICLED MILLET.--This is the smallest-seeded of the
    corn-plants, being a true grass; but the number of the seeds in
    each ear makes up for their size. It grows in sandy soils that
    will not do for the cultivation of many other kinds of grain,
    and forms the chief sustenance in the arid districts of Arabia,
    Syria, Nubia, and parts of India. It is not cultivated in
    England, being principally confined to the East. The nations who
    make use of it grind it, in the primitive manner, between two
    stones, and make it into a diet which, cannot be properly called
    bread, but rather a kind of soft thin cake half-baked. When we
    take into account that the Arabians are fond of lizards and
    locusts as articles of food, their cuisine, altogether, is
    scarcely a tempting one.

TO MAKE RUSKS.

(Suffolk Recipe.)

1734. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 2 oz. of butter, 1/4 pint of milk, 2 oz. of
loaf sugar, 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of yeast.

Mode.--Put the milk and butter into a saucepan, and keep shaking it round until the latter
is melted. Put the flour into a basin with the sugar, mix these well together, and beat the
eggs. Stir them with the yeast to the milk and butter, and with this liquid work the flour
into a smooth dough. Cover a cloth over the basin, and leave the dough to rise by the side
of the fire; then knead it, and divide it into 12 pieces; place them in a brisk oven, and bake
for about 20 minutes. Take the rusks out, break them in half, and then set them in the oven
to get crisp on the other side. When cold, they should be put into tin canisters to keep them
dry; and, if intended for the cheese course, the sifted sugar should be omitted.

Time.--20 minutes to bake the rusks; 5 minutes to render them crisp after being divided.

Average cost, 8d.

Sufficient to make 2 dozen rusks. Seasonable at any time.

ALMOND ICING FOR CAKES.

1735. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of finely-pounded loaf sugar allow 1 lb. of sweet almonds,
the whites of 4 eggs, a little rose-water.

Mode.--Blanch the almonds, and pound them (a few at a time) in a mortar to a paste, adding
a little rose-water to facilitate the operation. Whisk the whites of the eggs to a strong froth;
mix them with the pounded almonds, stir in the sugar, and beat altogether. When the cake is
sufficiently baked, lay on the almond icing, and put it into the oven to dry. Before laying
this preparation on the cake, great care must be taken that it is nice and smooth, which is
easily accomplished by well beating the mixture.

SUGAR ICING FOR CAKES.

1736. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of loaf sugar allow the whites of 4 eggs, 1 oz. of fine starch.

Mode.--Beat the eggs to a strong froth, and gradually sift in the sugar, which should be reduced
to the finest possible powder, and gradually add the starch, also finely powdered. Beat the
mixture well until the sugar is smooth; then with a spoon or broad knife lay the icing equally
over the cakes. These should then be placed in a very cool oven, and the icing allowed to dry
and harden, but not to colour. The icing may be coloured with strawberry or currant-juice,
or with prepared cochineal. If it be put on the cakes as soon as they are withdrawn from the
oven, it will become firm and hard by the time the cakes are cold. On very rich cakes, such
as wedding, christening cakes, &c., a layer of almond icing, No. 1735, is usually spread over
the top, and over that the white icing as described. All iced cakes should be kept in a very
dry place.

BISCUIT POWDER, generally used for Infants' Food.

1737. This powder may be purchased in tin canisters, and may also be prepared at home. Dry
the biscuits well in a slow oven; roll them and grind them with a rolling-pin on a clean board,
until they are reduced to powder; sift it through a close hair sieve, and it is fit for use.
It should be kept in well-covered tins, and in a dry place.

ARROWROOT BISCUITS OR DROPS.

1738. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of butter, 6 eggs, 1/2 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of arrowroot, 1/2 lb.
of pounded loaf sugar.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream; whisk the eggs to a strong froth, add them to the butter,
stir in the flour a little at a time, and beat the mixture well. Break down all the lumps from
the arrowroot, and add that with the sugar to the other ingredients. Mix all well together,
drop the dough on a buttered tin, in pieces the size of a shilling, and bake the biscuits about
1/4 hour in a slow oven.

Seasonable at any time.

NICE BREAKFAST CAKES.

1739.

Mode.--These cakes are made in the same manner as the soda bread No. 1722, with the addition
of eggs and sugar. Mix the flour, tartaric acid, and salt well together, taking care that the
two latter ingredients are reduced to the finest powder, and stir in the sifted sugar, which
should also be very fine. Dissolve the soda in the milk, add the eggs, which should be well
whisked, and with this liquid work the flour, &c. into a light dough. Divide it into small
cakes, put them into the oven immediately, and bake for about 20 minutes.

Time.--20 minutes.

COCOA-NUT BISCUITS OR CAKES.

1740. INGREDIENTS.--10 oz. of sifted sugar, 3 eggs, 6 oz. of grated cocoa-nut.

Mode.--Whisk the eggs until they are very light; add the sugar gradually; then stir in the
cocoa-nut. Roll a tablespoonful of the paste at a time in your hands in the form of a pyramid;
place the pyramids on paper, put the paper on tins, and bake the biscuits in rather a cool
oven until they are just coloured a light brown.

Time.--About 1/4 hour. Seasonable at any time.

CRISP BISCUITS.

1741. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, the yolk of 1 egg, milk.

Mode.--Mix the flour and the yolk of the egg with sufficient milk to make the whole into a
very stiff paste; beat it well, and knead it until it is perfectly smooth. Roll the paste out
very thin; with a round cutter shape it into small biscuits, and bake them a nice brown in
a slow oven from 12 to 18 minutes.

Time.--12 to 18 minutes. Average cost, 4d.

Seasonable at any time.

DESSERT BISCUITS, which may be flavoured with Ground Ginger, Cinnamon, &c. &c.

1742.

Mode.--Put the butter into a basin; warm it, but do not allow it to oil; then with the hand
beat it to a cream. Add the flour by degrees, then the sugar and flavouring, and moisten the
whole with the yolks of the eggs, which should previously be well beaten. When all the ingredients
are thoroughly incorporated, drop the mixture from a spoon on to a buttered paper, leaving
a distance between each cake, as they spread as soon as they begin to get warm. Bake in rather
a slow oven from 12 to 18 minutes, and do not let the biscuits acquire too much colour. In
making the above quantity, half may be flavoured with ground ginger and the other half with
essence of lemon or currants, to make a variety. With whatever the preparation is flavoured,
so are the biscuits called; and an endless variety may be made in this manner.

Time.--12 to 18 minutes, or rather longer, in a very slow oven.

Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient to make from 3 to 4 dozen cakes.

Seasonable at any time.

LEMON BISCUITS.

1743--INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 lb. of flour, 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar, 6 oz. of fresh butter, 4 eggs,
1 oz. of lemon-peel, 2 dessertspoonfuls of lemon-juice.

Mode.--Rub the flour into the butter; stir in the pounded sugar and very finely-minced lemon-peel,
and when these ingredients are thoroughly mixed, add the eggs, which should be previously well
whisked, and the lemon-juice. Beat the mixture well for a minute or two, then drop it from
a spoon on to a buttered tin, about 2 inches apart, as the cakes will spread when they get
warm; place the tin in the oven, and bake the cakes of a pale brown from 15 to 20 minutes.

Time.--15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

MACAROONS.

1744. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of sweet almonds, 1/2 lb. of sifted loaf sugar, the whites of 3
eggs, wafer-paper.

Mode.--Blanch, skin, and dry the almonds, and pound them well with a little orange-flower water
or plain water; then add to them the sifted sugar and the whites of the eggs, which should
be beaten to a stiff froth, and mix all the ingredients well together. When the paste looks
soft, drop it at equal distances from a biscuit-syringe on to sheets of wafer-paper; put a
strip of almond on the top of each; strew some sugar over, and bake the macaroons in rather
a slow oven, of a light brown colour when hard and set, they are done, and must not be allowed
to get very brown, as that would spoil their appearance. If the cakes, when baked, appear heavy,
add a little more white of egg, but let this always be well whisked before it is added to the
other ingredients. We have given a recipe for making these cakes, but we think it almost or
quite as economical to purchase such articles as these at a good confectioner's.

Time.--From 15 to 20 minutes, in a slow oven.

Average cost, 1s. 8d. per lb.

RATAFIAS.

1745. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of sweet almonds, 1/4 lb. of bitter ones, 3/4 lb. of sifted loaf
sugar, the whites of 4 eggs.

Mode.--Blanch, skin, and dry the almonds, and pound them in a mortar with the white of an egg;
stir in the sugar, and gradually add the remaining whites of eggs, taking care that they are
very thoroughly whisked. Drop the mixture through a small biscuit-syringe on to cartridge paper,
and bake the cakes from 10 to 12 minutes in rather a quicker oven than for macaroons. A very
small quantity should be dropped on the paper to form one cake, as, when baked, the ratafias
should be about the size of a large button.

Time.--10 to 12 minutes. Average cost, 1s. 8d. per lb.

RICE BISCUITS OR CAKES.

1746. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1/2 lb. of rice-flour allow 1/4 lb. of pounded lump sugar, 1/4
lb. of butter, 2 eggs.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream, stir in the rice-flour and pounded sugar, and moisten the
whole with the eggs, which should be previously well beaten. Roll out the paste, shape it with
a round paste-cutter into small cakes, and bake them from 12 to 18 minutes in a very slow oven.

Time.--12 to 18 minutes. Average cost, 9d.

Sufficient to make about 18 cakes. Seasonable at any time.

    GROUND RICE, or rice-flour, is used for making several kinds of
    cakes, also for thickening soups, and for mixing with wheaten
    flour in producing Manna Kroup. The Americans make rice-bread,
    and prepare the flour for it in the following manner:--When the
    rice is thoroughly cleansed, the water is drawn off, and the
    rice, while damp, bruised in a mortar: it is then dried, and
    passed through a hair sieve.

ROCK BISCUITS.

1747. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 lb. of sifted sugar, 1/2 lb. of flour, a few currants.

Mode.--Break the eggs into a basin, beat them well until very light, add the pounded sugar,
and when this is well mixed with the eggs, dredge in the flour gradually, and add the currants.
Mix all well together, and put the dough, with a fork, on the tins, making it look as rough
as possible. Bake the cakes in a moderate oven from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; when they are done,
allow them to get cool, and store them away in a tin canister, in a dry place.

Seasonable at any time.

SAVOY BISCUITS OR CAKES.

1748. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 6 oz. of pounded sugar, the rind of 1 lemon, 6 oz. of flour.

Mode.--Break the eggs into a basin, separating the whites from the yolks; beat the yolks well,
mix with them the pounded sugar and grated lemon-rind, and beat these ingredients together
for 1/4 hour. Then dredge in the flour gradually, and when the whites of the eggs have been
whisked to a solid froth, stir them to the flour, &c.; beat the mixture well for another 5
minutes, then draw it along in strips upon thick cartridge paper to the proper size of the
biscuit, and bake them in rather a hot oven; but let them be carefully watched, as they are
soon done, and a few seconds over the proper time will scorch and spoil them. These biscuits,
or ladies'-fingers, as they are called, are used for making Charlotte russes, and for a variety
of fancy sweet dishes.

Time.--5 to 8 minutes, in a quick oven.

Average cost, 1s. 8d. per lb., or 1/2d. each.

SEED BISCUITS.

1749.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream; stir in the flour, sugar, and caraway seeds; and when these
ingredients are well mixed, add the eggs, which should be well whisked. Roll out the paste,
with a round cutter shape out the biscuits, and bake them in a moderate oven from 10 to 15
minutes. The tops of the biscuits may be brushed over with a little milk or the white of an
egg, and then a little sugar strewn over.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient to make 3 dozen biscuits. Seasonable at any time.

SIMPLE HARD BISCUITS.

1750. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 2 oz. of butter, about 1/2 pint of skimmed milk.

Mode.--Warm the butter in the milk until the former is dissolved, and then mix it with the
flour into a very stiff paste; beat it with a rolling-pin until the dough looks perfectly smooth.
Roll it out thin; cut it with the top of a glass into round biscuits; prick them well, and
bake them from 6 to 10 minutes. The above is the proportion of milk which we think would convert
the flour into a stiff paste; but should it be found too much, an extra spoonful or two of
flour must be put in. These biscuits are very nice for the cheese course.

Time.--6 to 10 minutes.

Seasonable at any time.

SODA BISCUITS.

1751. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of pounded loaf sugar, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter,
2 eggs, 1 small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.

Mode.--Put the flour (which should be perfectly dry) into a basin; rub in the butter, add the
sugar, and mix these ingredients well together. Whisk the eggs, stir them into the mixture,
and beat it well, until everything is well incorporated. Quickly stir in the soda, roll the
paste out until it is about 1/2 inch thick, cut it into small round cakes with a tin cutter,
and bake them from 12 to 18 minutes in rather a brisk oven. After the soda is added, great
expedition is necessary in rolling and cutting out the paste, and in putting the biscuits immediately
into the oven, or they will be heavy. Seasonable at any time.

ALMOND CAKE.

1752. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of sweet almonds, 1 oz. of bitter almonds, 6 eggs, 8 tablespoonfuls
of sifted sugar, 5 tablespoonfuls of fine flour, the grated rind of 1 lemon, 3 oz. of butter.

Mode.--Blanch and pound the almonds to a paste; separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs;
beat the latter, and add them to the almonds. Stir in the sugar, flour, and lemon-rind; add
the butter, which should be beaten to a cream; and when all these ingredients are well mixed,
put in the whites of the eggs, which should be whisked to a stiff froth. Butter a cake-mould,
put in the mixture, and bake in a good oven from 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 hour.

Time.--1-1/4 to 1-3/4 hour. Average cost, 1s.

Seasonable at any time.

RICH BRIDE OR CHRISTENING CAKE.

1753. INGREDIENTS.--5 lbs. of the finest flour, 3 lbs. of fresh butter, 5 lbs. of currants,
2 lbs. of sifted loaf sugar, 2 nutmegs, 1/4 oz. of mace, half 1/4 oz. of cloves, 16 eggs, 1
lb. of sweet almonds, 1/2 lb. of candied citron, 1/2 lb. each of candied orange and lemon peel,
1 gill of wine, 1 gill of brandy.

Mode.--Let the flour be as fine as possible, and well dried and sifted; the currants washed,
picked, and dried before the fire; the sugar well pounded and sifted; the nutmegs grated, the
spices pounded; the eggs thoroughly whisked, whites and yolks separately; the almonds pounded
with a little orange-flower water, and the candied peel cut in neat slices. When all these
ingredients are prepared, mix them in the following manner. Begin working the butter with the
hand till it becomes of a cream-like consistency; stir in the sugar, and when the whites of
the eggs are whisked to a solid froth, mix them with the butter and sugar; next, well beat
up the yolks for 10 minutes, and, adding them to the flour, nutmegs, mace, and cloves, continue
beating the whole together for 1/2 hour or longer, till wanted for the oven. Then mix in lightly
the currants, almonds, and candied peel with the wine and brandy; and having lined a hoop with
buttered paper, fill it with the mixture, and bake the cake in a tolerably quick oven, taking
care, however, not to burn it: to prevent this, the top of it may be covered with a sheet of
paper. To ascertain whether the cake is done, plunge a clean knife into the middle of it, withdraw
it directly, and if the blade is not sticky, and looks bright, the cake is sufficiently baked.
These cakes are usually spread with a thick layer of almond icing, and over that another layer
of sugar icing, and afterwards ornamented. In baking a large cake like this, great attention
must be paid to the heat of the oven; it should not be too fierce, but have a good soaking heat.

Time.--5 to 6 hours. Average cost, 2s. per lb.

CHRISTMAS CAKE.

1754. INGREDIENTS.--5 teacupfuls of flour, 1 teacupful of melted butter, 1 teacupful of cream,
1 teacupful of treacle, 1 teacupful of moist sugar, 2 eggs, 1/2 oz. of powdered ginger, 1/2
lb. of raisins, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar.

Mode.--Make the butter sufficiently warm to melt it, but do not allow it to oil; put the flour
into a basin; add to it the sugar, ginger, and raisins, which should be stoned and cut into
small pieces. When these dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed, stir in the butter, cream, treacle,
and well-whisked eggs, and beat the mixture for a few minutes. Dissolve the soda in the vinegar,
add it to the dough, and be particular that these latter ingredients are well incorporated
with the others; put the cake into a buttered mould or tin, place it in a moderate oven immediately,
and bake it from 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 hours.

Time.--1-3/4 to 2-1/4 hours. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

COMMON CAKE, suitable for sending to Children at School.

1755. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 4 oz. of butter or clarified dripping, 1/2 oz. of caraway
seeds, 1/4 oz. of allspice, 1/2 lb. of pounded sugar, 1 lb. of currants, 1 pint of milk, 3
tablespoonfuls of fresh yeast.

Mode.--Rub the butter lightly into the flour; add all the dry ingredients, and mix these well
together. Make the milk warm, but not hot; stir in the yeast, and with this liquid make the
whole into a light dough; knead it well, and line the cake-tins with strips of buttered paper;
this paper should be about 6 inches higher than the top of the tin. Put in the dough; stand
it in a warm place to rise for more than an hour; then bake the cakes in a well-heated oven. 9d.

Sufficient to make 2 moderate-sized cakes.

ECONOMICAL CAKE.

1756. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1/4 lb. of butter or lard, 1/2 lb. of
currants, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, the whites of 4 eggs, 1/2 pint of milk.

Mode,--In making many sweet dishes, the whites of eggs are not required, and if well beaten
and added to the above ingredients, make an excellent cake, with or without currants. Beat
the butter to a cream, well whisk the whites of the eggs, and stir all the ingredients together
but the soda, which must not be added until all is well mixed, and the cake is ready to be
put into the oven.

A NICE USEFUL CAKE.

1757. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 6 oz. of currants, 1/4 lb. of sugar 1 lb. of dried flour,
2 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, 3 eggs, 1 teacupful of milk, 2 oz. of sweet almonds, 1 oz.
of candied peel.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream; wash, pick, and dry the currants; whisk the eggs; blanch
and chop the almonds, and cut the peel into neat slices. When all these are ready, mix the
dry ingredients together; then add the butter, milk, and eggs, and beat the mixture well for
a few minutes. Put the cake into a buttered mould or tin, and bake it for rather more than
1-1/2 hour. The currants and candied peel may be omitted, and a little lemon or almond flavouring
substituted for them: made in this manner, the cake will be found very good.

HONEY CAKE.

1758. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 breakfast-cupful of sugar, 1 breakfast-cupful of rich sour cream, 2
breakfast-cupfuls of flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, honey to taste.

Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at any time.

RICH SWEETMEAT GINGERBREAD NUTS.

1759. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of treacle, 1/4 lb. of clarified butter, 1 lb. of coarse brown sugar,
2 oz. of ground ginger, 1 oz. of candied orange-peel, 1 oz. of candied angelica, 1/2 oz. of
candied lemon-peel, 1/2 oz. of coriander seeds, 1/2 oz. of caraway seeds, 1 egg; flour.

Mode.--Put the treacle into a basin, and pour over it the butter, melted so as not to oil,
the sugar, and ginger. Stir these ingredients well together, and whilst mixing, add the candied
peel, which should be cut into very small pieces, but not bruised, and the caraway and coriander
seeds, which should be pounded. Having mixed all thoroughly together, break in an egg, and
work the whole up with as much fine flour as may be necessary to form a paste. Make this into
nuts of any size, put them on a tin plate, and bake in a slow oven from 1/4 to 1/2 hour.

Time.--1/4 to 1/2 hour. Average cost, from 1s. to 1s. 4d. per lb.

Seasonable at any time.

THICK GINGERBREAD.

1760. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of treacle, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1/4 lb. of coarse brown sugar, 1-1/2
lb. of flour, 1 oz. of ginger, 1/2 oz. of ground allspice, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda,
1/4 pint of warm milk, 3 eggs.

Mode.--Put the flour into a basin, with the sugar, ginger, and allspice; mix these together;
warm the butter, and add it, with the treacle, to the other ingredients. Stir well; make the
milk just warm, dissolve the carbonate of soda in it, and mix the whole into a nice smooth
dough with the eggs, which should be previously well whisked; pour the mixture into a buttered
tin, and bake it from 3/4 to 1 hour, or longer, should the gingerbread be very thick. Just
before it is done, brush the top over with the yolk of an egg beaten up with a little milk,
and put it back in the oven to finish baking.

Seasonable at any time.

SUNDERLAND GINGERBREAD NUTS.

(An Excellent Recipe.)

1761. INGREDIENTS.--1-3/4 lb. treacle, 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lb. of butter, 2-3/4 lbs. of
flour, 1-1/2 oz. of ground ginger, 1-1/2 oz. of allspice, 1-1/2 oz. of coriander seeds.

Mode.--Let the allspice, coriander seeds, and ginger be freshly ground; put them into a basin,
with the flour and sugar, and mix these ingredients well together; warm the treacle and butter
together; then with a spoon work it into the flour, &c., until the whole forms a nice smooth
paste. Drop the mixture from the spoon on to a piece of buttered paper, and bake in rather
a slow oven from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour. A little candied lemon-peel mixed with the above is
an improvement, and a great authority in culinary matters suggests the addition of a little
cayenne pepper in gingerbread. Whether it be advisable to use this latter ingredient or not,
we leave our readers to decide.

WHITE GINGERBREAD.

1762.

Mode.--Rub the butter into the flour; add the sugar, which should be finely pounded and sifted,
and the minced lemon-rind, ginger, and nutmeg. 3d.

Seasonable at any time.

GOOD HOLIDAY CAKE.

1763. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2d. worth of Borwick's German baking-powder, 2 lbs. of flour, 6 oz.
of butter, 1/4 lb. of lard, 1 lb. of currants, 1/2 lb. of stoned and cut raisins, 1/4 lb. of
mixed candied peel, 1/2 lb. of moist sugar, 3 eggs, 3/4 pint of cold milk.

Mode.--Mix the baking-powder with the flour; then rub in the butter and lard; have ready the
currants, washed, picked, and dried the raisins stoned and cut into small pieces (not chopped),
and the peel cut into neat slices. Add these with the sugar to the flour, &c., and mix all
the dry ingredients well together. Whisk the eggs, stir to them the milk, and with this liquid
moisten the cake; beat it up well, that all may be very thoroughly mixed; line a cake-tin with
buttered paper, put in the cake, and bake it from 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 hours in a good oven. To ascertain
when it is done, plunge a clean knife into the middle of it, and if, on withdrawing it, the
knife looks clean, and not sticky, the cake is done. To prevent its burning at the top, a piece
of clean paper may be put over whilst the cake is soaking, or being thoroughly cooked in the
middle. A steamer, such as is used for steaming potatoes, makes a very good cake-tin, if it
be lined at the bottom and sides with buttered paper.

Time.--2-1/4 to 2-3/4 hours. Average cost, 2s. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

LEMON CAKE.

1764. INGREDIENTS.--10 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of orange-flower water, 3/4 lb. of pounded loaf
sugar, 1 lemon, 3/4 lb. of flour.

Mode.--Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs whisk the former to a stiff froth; add
the orange-flower water, the sugar, grated lemon-rind, and mix these ingredients well together.
Then beat the yolks of the eggs, and add them, with the lemon-juice, to the whites, &c.; dredge
in the flour gradually; keep beating the mixture well; put it into a buttered mould, and bake
the cake about an hour, or rather longer. The addition of a little butter, beaten to a cream,
we think, would improve this cake.

Time.--About 1 hour. Average cost, 1s. 4d.

Seasonable at any time.

LUNCHEON CAKE.

1765. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of flour, 1/2 oz. of caraway seeds, 1/4 lb. of
currants, 6 oz. of moist sugar, 1 oz. of candied peel, 3 eggs, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 small teaspoonful
of carbonate of soda.

Mode.--Rub the butter into the flour until it is quite fine; add the caraway seeds, currants
(which should be nicely washed, picked, and dried), sugar, and candied peel cut into thin slices;
mix these well together, and moisten with the eggs, which should be well whisked. Boil the
milk, and add to it, whilst boiling, the carbonate of soda, which must be well stirred into
it, and, with the milk, mix the other ingredients. Butter a tin, pour the cake into it, and
bake it in a moderate oven from 3/4 to 1 hour.

Time.--1 to 14 hour. Average cost, 1s. 8d. Seasonable at any time.

    CARBONATE OF SODA--Soda was called the mineral alkali, because
    it was originally dug up out of the ground in Africa and other
    countries: this state of carbonate of soda is called natron.
    But carbonate of soda is likewise procured from the combustion
    of marine plants, or such as grow on the sea-shore. Pure
    carbonate of soda is employed for making effervescing draughts,
    with lemon-juice, citric acid, or tartaric acid. The chief
    constituent of soda, the alkali, has been used in France from
    time immemorial in the manufacture of soap and glass, two
    chemical productions which employ and keep in circulation an
    immense amount of capital. A small pinch of carbonate of soda
    will give an extraordinary lightness to puff pastes; and,
    introduced into the teapot, will extract the full strength of
    the tea. But its qualities have a powerful effect upon delicate
    constitutions, and it is not to be used incautiously in any
    preparation.

A NICE PLAIN CAKE.

1766. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1 teaspoonful of Borwick's baking-powder, 1/4 lb. of good
dripping, 1 teacupful of moist sugar, 3 eggs, 1 breakfast-cupful of milk, 1 oz. of caraway
seeds, 1/2 lb. of currants.

Mode.--Put the flour and baking-powder into a basin; stir those together; then rub in the dripping,
add the sugar, caraway seeds, and currants; whisk the eggs with the milk, and beat all together
very thoroughly until the ingredients are well mixed. Butter a tin, put in the cake, and bake
it from 11/2 to 2 hours. Let the dripping be quite clean before using: to insure this, it is
a good plan to clarify it. Beef dripping is better than any other for cakes, &c., as mutton
dripping frequently has a very unpleasant flavour, which would be imparted to the preparation.

Seasonable at any time.

A NICE PLAIN CAKE FOR CHILDREN.

1767. INGREDIENTS.--1 quartern of dough, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 1/4 lb. of butter or good
beef dripping, 1/4 pint of warm milk, 1/2 grated nutmeg or 1/2 oz. of caraway seeds.

Mode.--If you are not in the habit of making bread at home, procure the dough from the baker's,
and, as soon as it comes in, put it into a basin near the fire; cover the basin with a thick
cloth, and let the dough remain a little while to rise. In the mean time, beat the butter to
a cream, and make the milk warm; and when the dough has risen, mix with it thoroughly all the
above ingredients, and knead the cake well for a few minutes. Butter some cake-tins, half fill
them, and stand them in a warm place, to allow the dough to rise again. When the tins are three
parts full, put the cakes into a good oven, and bake them from 13/4 to 2 hours. A few currants
might be substituted for the caraway seeds when the flavour of the latter is disliked.

Time.--1-3/4 to 2 hours. Average cost, 1s. 2d.

Seasonable at any time.

COMMON PLUM CAKE.

1768. To ascertain when they are done, plunge a clean knife into the middle, and if on withdrawal
it comes out clean, the cakes are done. 8d.

Sufficient to make 6 small cakes.

A NICE PLUM CAKE.

1769.

Mode.--Put the flour into a basin with the sugar, currants, and sliced candied peel; beat the
butter to a cream, and mix all these ingredients together with the milk. Stir the ammonia into
2 tablespoonfuls of milk and add it to the dough, and beat the whole well, until everything
is thoroughly mixed. 3d.

Seasonable at any time.

POUND CAKE.

1770. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of butter, 1-1/4 lb. of flour, 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar, 1 lb.
of currants, 9 eggs, 2 oz. of candied peel, 1/2 oz. of citron, 1/2 oz. of sweet almonds; when
liked, a little pounded mace.

Mode.--Work the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour; add the sugar, currants, candied peel,
which should be cut into neat slices, and the almonds, which should be blanched and chopped,
and mix all these well together; whisk the eggs, and let them be thoroughly blended with the
dry ingredients. Beat the cake well for 20 minutes, and put it into a round tin, lined at the
bottom and sides with a strip of white buttered paper. Bake it from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, and let
the oven be well heated when the cake is first put in, as, if this is not the case, the currants
will all sink to the bottom of it. To make this preparation light, the yolks and whites of
the eggs should be beaten separately, and added separately to the other ingredients. A glass
of wine is sometimes added to the mixture; but this is scarcely necessary, as the cake will
be found quite rich enough without it. 6d.

Sufficient.--The above quantity divided in two will make two nice-sized cakes.

Seasonable at any time.

A PAVINI CAKE.

1771.

Mode.--Stone and cut the raisins into small pieces; wash, pick, and dry the currants; melt
the butter to a cream, but without oiling it; blanch and chop the almonds, and grate the nutmeg.
When all these ingredients are thus prepared, mix them well together; make the milk warm, stir
in the soda, and with this liquid make the whole into a paste. Butter a mould, rather more
than half fill it with the dough, and bake the cake in a moderate oven from 1-1/2 to 2 hours,
or less time should it be made into 2 cakes. 8d.

Seasonable at any time.

RICE CAKE.

1772.

Mode.--Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs; whisk them both well, and add to the
latter the butter beaten to a cream. It may be flavoured with essence of almonds, when this
is preferred.

Seasonable at any time.

QUEEN-CAKES.

1773. Whisk the eggs, mix them with the cream and flavouring, and stir these to the flour;
add the carbonate of soda, beat the paste well for 10 minutes, put it into small buttered pans,
and bake the cake from 1/4 to 1/2 hour.

Grated lemon-rind may be substituted for the lemon and almond flavouring, which will make the
cakes equally nice. 9d.

Seasonable at any time.

SAUCER-CAKE FOR TEA.

1774.

Mode.--Mix the flour and tous-les-mois together; add the sugar, the candied peel cut into thin
slices, the butter beaten to a cream, and the eggs well whisked. Beat the mixture for 10 minutes,
put it into a buttered cake-tin or mould, or, if this is not obtainable, a soup-plate answers
the purpose, lined with a piece of buttered paper. Bake the cake in a moderate oven from 1
to 1-1/4 hour, and when cold, put it away in a covered canister. It will remain good some weeks,
even if it be cut into slices.

Seasonable at any time.

COMMON SEED-CAKE.

1775. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 quartern of dough, 1/4 lb. of good dripping, 6 oz. of moist sugar,
1/2 oz. of caraway seeds, 1 egg.

Mode.--If the dough is sent in from the baker's, put it in a basin covered with a cloth, and
set it in a warm place to rise. Then with a wooden spoon beat the dripping to a liquid; add
it, with the other ingredients, to the dough, and beat it until everything is very thoroughly
mixed. Put it into a buttered tin, and bake the cake for rather more than 2 hours.

Time.--Rather more than 2 hours.

Average cost, 8d.

Seasonable at any time.

A VERY GOOD SEED-CAKE.

1776. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of butter, 6 eggs, 3/4 lb. of sifted sugar, pounded mace and grated
nutmeg to taste, 1 lb. of flour, 3/4 oz. of caraway seeds, 1 wineglassful of brandy.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour; add the sugar, mace, nutmeg, and caraway
seeds, and mix these ingredients well together. Whisk the eggs, stir to them the brandy, and
beat the cake again for 10 minutes. This cake would be equally nice made with currants, and
omitting the caraway seeds. 6d.

Seasonable at any time.

    BREAD-MAKING IN SPAIN.--The bread in the south of Spain is
    delicious: it is white as snow, close as cake, and yet very
    light; the flavour is most admirable, for the wheat is good and
    pure, and the bread well kneaded. The way they make this bread
    is as follows:--From large round panniers filled with wheat they
    take out a handful at a time, sorting it most carefully and
    expeditiously, and throwing every defective grain into another
    basket. This done, the wheat is ground between two circular
    stones, as it was ground in Egypt 2,000 years ago (see No. 117),
    the requisite rotary motion being given by a blindfolded mule,
    which paces round and round with untiring patience, a bell being
    attached to his neck, which, as long as he is in movement,
    tinkles on; and when it stops, he is urged to his duty by the
    shout of "Arre, mula," from some one within hearing. When
    ground, the wheat is sifted through three sieves, the last of
    these being so fine that only the pure flour can pass through
    it: this is of a pale apricot-colour. The bread is made in the
    evening. It is mixed with only sufficient water, with a little
    salt in it, to make it into dough: a very small quantity of
    leaven, or fermenting mixture is added. The Scripture says, "A
    little leaven leaveneth the whole lump;" but in England, to
    avoid the trouble of kneading, many put as much leaven or yeast
    in one batch of household bread as in Spain would last them a
    week for the six or eight donkey-loads of bread they send every
    night from their oven. The dough made, it is put into sacks, and
    carried on the donkeys' backs to the oven in the centre of the
    village, so as to bake it immediately it is kneaded. On arriving
    there, the dough is divided into portions weighing 3 lbs. each.
    Two long narrow wooden tables on trestles are then placed down
    the room; and now a curious sight may be seen. About twenty men
    (bakers) come in and range themselves on one side of the tables.
    A lump of dough is handed to the nearest, which he commences
    kneading and knocking about with all his might for about 3 or 4
    minutes, and then passes it on to his neighbour, who does the
    same; and so on successively until all have kneaded it, when it
    becomes as soft as new putty, and ready for the oven. Of course,
    as soon as the first baker has handed the first lump to his
    neighbour, another is given to him, and so on till the whole
    quantity of dough is successively kneaded by them all. The
    bakers' wives and daughters shape the loaves for the oven, and
    some of them are very small, and they are baked immediately. The
    ovens are very large, and not heated by fires under them; but
    a quantity of twigs of the herbs of sweet marjoram and thyme,
    which cover the hills in great profusion, are put in the oven
    and ignited. They heat the oven to any extent required; and, as
    the bread gets baked, the oven gets gradually colder; so the
    bread is never burned. They knead the bread in Spain with such
    force, that the palm of the hand and the second joints of the
    fingers of the bakers are covered with corns; and it so affects
    the chest, that they cannot work more than two hours at a time.

SNOW-CAKE.

1777. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of tous-les-mois, 1/4 lb. of white pounded sugar, 1/4 lb. of fresh
or washed salt butter, 1 egg, the juice of 1 lemon.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream; then add the egg, previously well beaten, and then the other
ingredients; if the mixture is not light, add another egg, and beat for 1/4 hour, until it
turns white and light. Line a flat tin, with raised edges, with a sheet of buttered paper;
pour in the cake, and put it into the oven. It must be rather slow, and the cake not allowed
to brown at all. If the oven is properly heated, 1 to 1-1/4 hour will be found long enough
to bake it. Let it cool a few minutes, then with a clean sharp knife cut it into small square
pieces, which should be gently removed to a large flat dish to cool before putting away. This
will keep for several weeks.

Seasonable at any time.

SNOW-CAKE.

(A genuine Scotch Recipe.)

1778. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of arrowroot, 1/2 lb. of pounded white sugar, 1/2 lb. of butter,
the whites of 6 eggs; flavouring to taste, of essence of almonds, or vanilla, or lemon.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream; stir in the sugar and arrowroot gradually, at the same time
beating the mixture. Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, add them to the other ingredients,
and beat well for 20 minutes. Put in whichever of the above flavourings may be preferred; pour
the cake into a buttered mould or tin and bake it in a moderate oven from 1 to 1-1/2 hour.

Time.--1 to 1-1/2 hour.

Average cost, with the best Bermuda arrowroot, 4s. 6d.; with St. Vincent ditto, 2s. 9d.

Sufficient to make a moderate-sized cake. Seasonable at any time.

SCRAP-CAKES.

1779.

Mode.--Cut the leaf, or flead, as it is sometimes called, into small pieces; put it into a
large dish, which place in a quick oven; be careful that it does not burn, and in a short time
it will be reduced to oil, with the small pieces of leaf floating on the surface; and it is
of these that the cakes should be made. Gather all the scraps together, put them into a basin
with the flour, and rub them well together. Add the currants, sugar, candied peel, cut into
thin slices, and the ground allspice. When all these ingredients are well mixed, moisten with
sufficient cold water to make the whole into a nice paste; roll it out thin, cut it into shapes,
and bake the cakes in a quick oven from 15 to 20 minutes. These are very economical and wholesome
cakes for children, and the lard, melted at home, produced from the flead, is generally better
than that you purchase. To prevent the lard from burning, and to insure its being a good colour,
it is better to melt it in a jar placed in a saucepan of boiling water; by doing it in this
manner, there will be no chance of its discolouring.

Time.--15 to 20 minutes.

Sufficient to make 3 or 4 dozen cakes.

Seasonable from September to March.

    Wheat is liable to several diseases, which affect the flour made
    from it, and render it unfit for good bread. The principal of
    these are the blight, mildew, and smut, which are occasioned by
    microscopic fungi, which sow themselves and grow upon the stems
    and ears, destroying the nutritive principles, and introducing
    matter of a deleterious kind. The farmer is at the utmost pains
    to keep away these intruders. Wheat, as well as all kinds of
    corn, is also very liable to be injured by being stacked before
    it is quite dry; in which case it will heat, and become musty in
    the ricks. In wet harvests it is sometimes impossible to get it
    sufficiently dried, and a great deal of corn is thus often
    spoiled. It is generally reckoned that the sweetest bread is
    made from wheat threshed out before it is stacked; which shows
    the importance of studying the best modes of preserving it.

    The erudite are not agreed as to the aboriginal country of corn:
    some say it is Egypt, others Tartary; and the learned Bailly, as
    well as the traveller Pallas, affirms that it grows
    spontaneously in Siberia. Be that as it may, the Phocians
    brought it to Marseilles before the Romans had penetrated into
    Gaul. The Gauls ate the corn cooked or bruised in a mortar: they
    did not know, for a long time, how to make fermented bread.

SCOTCH SHORTBREAD.

1780. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of butter, 1/4 lb. of pounded loaf sugar, 1/2 oz.
of caraway seeds, 1 oz. of sweet almonds, a few strips of candied orange-peel.

Mode.--Beat the butter to a cream, gradually dredge in the flour, and add the sugar, caraway
seeds, and sweet almonds, which should be blanched and cut into small pieces. Work the paste
until it is quite smooth, and divide it into six pieces. Put each cake on a separate piece
of paper, roll the paste out square to the thickness of about an inch, and pinch it upon all
sides. Prick it well, and ornament with one or two strips of candied orange-peel. Put the cakes
into a good oven, and bake them from 25 to 30 minutes.

Time.--25 to 30 minutes.

Average cost, for this quantity, 2s.

Sufficient to make 6 cakes.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Where the flavour of the caraway seeds is disliked, omit them, and add rather a larger
proportion of candied peel.

SODA-CAKE.

1781. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1/2 lb. of moist
sugar, 1 teacupful of milk, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.

Mode.--Rub the butter into the flour, add the currants and sugar, and mix these ingredients
well together. Whisk the eggs well, stir them to the flour, &c., with the milk, in which the
soda should be previously dissolved, and beat the whole up together with a wooden spoon or
beater. Divide the dough into two pieces, put them into buttered moulds or cake-tins, and bake
in a moderate oven for nearly an hour. The mixture must be extremely well beaten up, and not
allowed to stand after the soda is added to it, but must be placed in the oven immediately.
Great care must also be taken that the cakes are quite done through, which may be ascertained
by thrusting a knife into the middle of them: if the blade looks bright when withdrawn, they
are done. If the tops acquire too much colour before the inside is sufficiently baked, cover
them over with a piece of clean white paper, to prevent them from burning.

Seasonable at any time.

SAVOY CAKE.

1782. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 4 eggs in pounded loaf sugar, the weight of 7 in flour, a
little grated lemon-rind, or essence of almonds, or orange-flower water.

Mode.--Break the 7 eggs, putting the yolks into one basin and the whites into another. Whisk
the former, and mix with them the sugar, the grated lemon-rind, or any other flavouring to
taste; beat them well together, and add the whites of the eggs, whisked to a froth. This is
a very nice cake for dessert, and may be iced for a supper-table, or cut into slices and spread
with jam, which converts it into sandwiches.

Seasonable at any time.

SPONGE-CAKE.

I.

1783. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 8 eggs in pounded loaf sugar, the weight of 5 in flour, the
rind of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.

Mode.--Put the eggs into one side of the scale, and take the weight of 8 in pounded loaf sugar,
and the weight of 5 in good dry flour. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat
the former, put them into a saucepan with the sugar, and let them remain over the fire until
milk-warm, keeping them well stirred. Then put them into a basin, add the grated lemon-rind
mixed with the brandy, and stir these well together, dredging in the flour very gradually.
Whisk the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth, stir them to the flour, &c., and beat the
cake well for 1/4 hour. Put it into a buttered mould strewn with a little fine sifted sugar,
and bake the cake in a quick oven for 1-1/2 hour. Care must be taken that it is put into the
oven immediately, or it will not be light. The flavouring of this cake may be varied by adding
a few drops of essence of almonds instead of the grated lemon-rind.

Seasonable at any time.

    The Egyptian, or Mummy Wheat, is not grown to any great extent,
    owing to its inferior quality; but it is notable for its large
    produce, and is often cultivated on allotment grounds and on
    small farms, where quantity rather than quality is desired. At
    Wix, in Essex, the seed of this wheat has produced, without
    artificial assistance, four thousandfold; some of the ears have
    had eleven offshoots, and have contained, altogether, eleven
    grains in one ear.

II.

1784.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water together until they form a thick syrup; let it cool a little,
then pour it to the eggs, which should be previously well whisked; and after the eggs and syrup
are mixed together, continue beating them for a few minutes. Grate the lemon-rind, mix the
carbonate of soda with the flour, and stir these lightly to the other ingredients; then add
the lemon-juice, and, when the whole is thoroughly mixed, pour it into a buttered mould, and
bake in rather a quick oven for rather more than 1 hour. The remains of sponge or Savoy cakes
answer very well for trifles, light puddings, &c.; and a very stale one (if not mouldy) makes
an excellent tipsy-cake.

Time.--Rather more than 1 hour.

Average cost, 10d.

Sufficient to make 1 cake.

Seasonable at any time.

TO MAKE SMALL SPONGE-CAKES.

1785. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 5 eggs in flour, the weight of 8 in pounded loaf sugar; flavouring
to taste.

Mode.--Let the flour be perfectly dry, and the sugar well pounded and sifted. Separate the
whites from the yolks of the eggs, and beat the latter up with the sugar; then whisk the whites
until they become rather stiff, and mix them with the yolks, but do not stir them more than
is just necessary to mingle the ingredients well together. Dredge in the flour by degrees,
add the flavouring; batter the tins well, pour in the batter, sift a little sugar over the
cakes, and bake them in rather a quick oven, but do not allow them to take too much colour,
as they should be rather pale. Remove them from the tins before they get cold, and turn them
on their faces, where let them remain until quite cold, when store them away in a closed tin
canister or wide-mouthed glass bottle.

Time.--10 to 15 minutes in a quick oven.

Average cost, 1d. each.

Seasonable at any time.

TEA-CAKES.

1786. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 1/4 lb. of butter or lard, 1
egg, a piece of German yeast the size of a walnut, warm milk.

Mode.--Put the flour (which should be perfectly dry) into a basin mix with it the salt, and
rub in the butter or lard; then beat the egg well, stir to it the yeast, and add these to the
flour with as much warm milk as will make the whole into a smooth paste, and knead it well.
Let it rise near the fire, and, when well risen, form it into cakes; place them on tins, let
them rise again for a few minutes before putting them into the oven, and bake from 1/4 to 1/2
hour in a moderate oven. These are very nice with a few currants and a little sugar added to
the other ingredients: they should be put in after the butter is rubbed in. These cakes should
be buttered, and eaten hot as soon as baked; but, when stale, they are very nice split and
toasted; or, if dipped in milk, or even water, and covered with a basin in the oven till hot,
they will be almost equal to new.

Sufficient to make 8 tea-cakes.

Seasonable at any time.

TO TOAST TEA-CAKES.

1787. Cut each tea-cake into three or four slices, according to its thickness; toast them on
both sides before a nice clear fire, and as each slice is done, spread it with butter on both
sides. When a cake is toasted, pile the slices one on the top of the other, cut them into quarters,
put them on a very hot plate, and send the cakes immediately to table. As they are wanted,
send them in hot, one or two at a time, as, if allowed to stand, they spoil, unless kept in
a muffin-plate over a basin of boiling water.

A NICE YEAST-CAKE.

1788.

Mode.--Put the milk and butter into a saucepan, and shake it round over a fire until the butter
is melted, but do not allow the milk to get very hot. Put the flour into a basin, stir to it
the milk and butter, the yeast, and eggs, which should be well beaten, and form the whole into
a smooth dough. When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, line 2 moderate-sized cake-tins
with buttered paper, which should be about six inches higher than the tin; pour in the mixture,
let it stand to rise again for another 1/2 hour, and then bake the cakes in a brisk oven for
about 1-1/2 hour. If the tops of them become too brown, cover them with paper until they are
done through. A few drops of essence of lemon, or a little grated nutmeg, may be added when
the flavour is liked.

Seasonable at any time.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEVERAGES.

1789. Beverages are innumerable in their variety; but the ordinary beverages drunk in the British
isles, may be divided into three classes:--1. Beverages of the simplest kind not fermented.
2. Beverages, consisting of water, containing a considerable quantity of carbonic acid. 3.
Beverages composed partly of fermented liquors. Of the first class may be mentioned,--water,
toast-and-water, barley-water, eau sucré, lait sucré, cheese and milk whey, milk-and-water,
lemonade, orangeade, sherbet, apple and pear juice, capillaire, vinegar-and-water, raspberry
vinegar and water.

1790. Of the common class of beverages, consisting of water impregnated with carbonic acid
gas, we may name soda-water, single and double, ordinary effervescing draughts, and ginger-beer.

1791. The beverages composed partly of fermented liquors, are hot spiced wines, bishop, egg-flip,
egg-hot, ale posset, sack posset, punch, and spirits-and-water.

1792. We will, however, forthwith treat on the most popular of our beverages, beginning with
the one which makes "the cup that cheers but not inebriates."

1793. The beverage called tea has now become almost a necessary of life. Previous to the middle
of the 17th century it was not used in England, and it was wholly unknown to the Greeks and
Romans. Pepys says, in his Diary,--"September 25th, 1661.--I sent for a cup of tea (a China
drink), of which I had never drunk before." Two years later it was so rare a commodity in England,
that the English East-India Company bought 2 lbs. 2 oz. of it, as a present for his majesty.
In 1666 it was sold in London for sixty shillings a pound. From that date the consumption has
gone on increasing from 5,000 lbs. to 50,000,000 lbs.

1794. Linnaeus was induced to think that there were two species of tea-plant, one of which
produced the black, and the other the green teas; but later observations do not confirm this.
When the leaves of black and green tea are expanded by hot water, and examined by the botanist,
though a difference of character is perceived, yet this is not sufficient to authorize considering
them as distinct species. The tea-tree flourishes best in temperate regions; in China it is
indigenous. The part of China where the best tea is cultivated, is called by us the "tea country."
The cultivation of the plant requires great care. It is raised chiefly on the sides of hills;
and, in order to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the leaves, the shrub is
pruned, so as not to exceed the height of from two to three feet, much in the same manner as
the vine is treated in France. They pluck the leaves, one selecting them according to the kinds
of tea required; and, notwithstanding the tediousness of the operation, each labourer is able
to gather from four to ten or fifteen pounds a day. When the trees attain to six or seven years
of age, the produce becomes so inferior that they are removed to make room for a fresh succession,
or they are cut down to allow of numerous young shoots. Teas of the finest flavour consist
of the youngest leaves; and as these are gathered at four different periods of the year, the
younger the leaves the higher flavoured the tea, and the scarcer, and consequently the dearer,
the article.

1795. The various names by which teas are sold in the British market are corruptions of Chinese
words. There are about a dozen different kinds; but the principal are Bohea, Congou, and Souchong,
and signify, respectively, inferior, middling, and superior. Teas are often perfumed and flavoured
with the leaves of different kinds of plants grown on purpose. Different tea-farms in China
produce teas of various qualities, raised by skilful cultivation on various soils.

1796. Tea, when chemically analyzed, is found to contain woody fibre, mucilage, a considerable
quantity of the astringent principle, or tannin, a narcotic principle, which is, perhaps, connected
with a peculiar aroma. The tannin is shown by its striking a black colour with sulphate of
iron, and is the cause of the dark stain which is always formed when tea is spilt upon buff-coloured
cottons dyed with iron. A constituent called Theine has also been discovered in tea, supposed
to be identical with Caffeine, one of the constituents of coffee. Liebig says, "Theine yields,
in certain processes of decomposition, a series of most remarkable products, which have much
analogy with those derived from uric acid in similar circumstances. The infusion of tea differs
from that of coffee, by containing iron and manganese. We have in tea, of many kinds, a beverage
which contains the active constituents of the most powerful mineral springs, and, however small
the amount of iron may be which we daily take in this form, it cannot be destitute of influence
on the vital processes."

1797. Chinese tea has frequently been adulterated in this country, by the admixture of the
dried leaves of certain plants. The leaves of the sloe, white thorn, ash, elder, and some others,
have been employed for this purpose; such as the leaves of the speedwell, wild germander, black
currants, syringa, purple-spiked willow-herb, sweet-brier, and cherry-tree. Some of these are
harmless, others are to a certain degree poisonous; as, for example, are the leaves of all
the varieties of the plum and cherry tribe, to which the sloe belongs. Adulteration by means
of these leaves is by no means a new species of fraud; and several acts of parliament, from
the time of George II., have been passed, specifying severe penalties against those guilty
of the offence, which, notwithstanding numerous convictions, continues to the present time.

1798. In the purchase of tea, that should be chosen which possesses an agreeable odour and
is as whole as possible, in order that the leaf may be easily examined. The greatest care should
be taken that it has not been exposed to the air, which destroys its flavour.

1799. It would be impossible, in the space at our command, to enumerate the various modes adopted
in different countries for "making coffee;" that is, the phrase commonly understood to mean
the complete preparation of this delicious beverage for drinking. For performing this operation,
such recipes or methods as we have found most practical will be inserted in their proper place;
but the following facts connected with coffee will be found highly interesting.

1800. The introduction of coffee into this country is comparatively of recent date. We are
assured by Bruce that the coffee-tree is a native of Abyssinia, and it is said to have been
cultivated in that country from time immemorial.

1801. It appears that coffee was first introduced into England by Daniel Edwards, a Turkey
merchant, whose servant, Pasqua, a Greek, understood the manner of roasting it. This servant,
under the patronage of Edwards, established the first coffee-house in London, in George Yard,
Lombard Street. Coffee was then sold at four or five guineas a pound, and a duty was soon afterwards
laid upon it of fourpence a gallon, when made into a beverage. In the course of two centuries,
however, this berry, unknown originally as an article of food, except to some savage tribes
on the confines of Abyssinia, has made its way through the whole of the civilized world. Mahommedans
of all ranks drink coffee twice a day; it is in universal request in France; and the demand
for it throughout the British isles is daily increasing, the more especially since so much
attention has been given to mechanical contrivances for roasting and grinding the berry and
preparing the beverage.

1802. Of the various kinds of coffee the Arabian is considered the best. It is grown chiefly
in the districts of Aden and Mocha; whence the name of our Mocha coffee. Mocha coffee has a
smaller and rounder bean than any other, and likewise a more agreeable smell and taste. The
next in reputation and quality is the Java and Ceylon coffee, and then the coffees of Bourbon
and Martinique, and that of Berbice, a district of the colony of British Guiana. The Jamaica
and St. Domingo coffees are less esteemed.

1803. A considerable change takes place in the arrangement of the constituents of coffee by
the application of heat in roasting it. Independently of one of the objects of roasting, namely,
that of destroying its toughness and rendering it easily ground, its tannin and other principles
are rendered partly soluble in water; and it is to the tannin that the brown colour of the
decoction of coffee is owing. An aromatic flavour is likewise developed during torrefaction,
which is not perceived in the raw berry, and which is not produced in the greatest perfection
until the heat has arrived at a certain degree of temperature; but, if the heat be increased
beyond this, the flavour is again dissipated, and little remains but a bitter and astringent
matter with carbon.

1804. The roasting of coffee in the best manner requires great nicety, and much of the qualities
of the beverage depends upon the operation. The roasting of coffee for the dealers in London
and Paris has now become a separate branch of business, and some of the roasters perform the
operation on a great scale, with considerable skill. Roasted coffee loses from 20 to 30 per
cent, by sufficient roasting, and the powder suffers much by exposure to the air; but, while
raw, it not only does not lose its flavour for a year or two, but improves by keeping. If a
cup of the best coffee be placed upon a table boiling hot, it will fill the room with its fragrance;
but the coffee, when warmed again after being cold, will be found to have lost most of its flavour.

1805. To have coffee in perfection, it should be roasted and ground just before it is used,
and more should not be ground at a time than is wanted for immediate use, or, if it be necessary
to grind more, it should be kept closed from the air. Coffee readily imbibes exhalations from
other substances, and thus often acquires a bad flavour: brown sugar placed near it will communicate
a disagreeable flavour. It is stated that the coffee in the West Indies has often been injured
by being laid in rooms near the sugar-works, or where rum is distilled; and the same effect
has been produced by bringing over coffee in the same ships with rum and sugar. Dr. Moseley
mentions that a few bags of pepper, on board a ship from India, spoiled a whole cargo of coffee.

1806. With respect to the quantity of coffee used in making the decoction, much depends upon
the taste of the consumer. The greatest and most common fault in English coffee is the too
small quantity of the ingredient. Count Rumford says that to make good coffee for drinking
after dinner, a pound of good Mocha coffee, which, when roasted and ground, weighs only thirteen
ounces, serves to make fifty-six full cups, or a little less than a quarter of an ounce to
a coffee-cup of moderate size.

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

TO MAKE CHOCOLATE.

1807. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 oz. of chocolate to each person; to every oz. allow 1/2 pint
of water, 1/2 pint of milk.

Mode.--Make the milk-and-water hot; scrape the chocolate into it, and stir the mixture constantly
and quickly until the chocolate is dissolved; bring it to the boiling-point, stir it well,
and serve directly with white sugar. Chocolate prepared with in a mill, as shown in the engraving,
is made by putting in the scraped chocolate, pouring over it the boiling milk-and-water, and
milling it over the fire until hot and frothy.

Sufficient.--Allow 1/2 oz. of cake chocolate to each person.

    CHOCOLATE AND COCOA.--Both these preparations are made from the
    seeds or beans of the cacao-tree, which grows in the West Indies
    and South America. The Spanish, and the proper name, is cacao,
    not cocoa, as it is generally spelt. From this mistake, the tree
    from which the beverage is procured has been often confounded
    with the palm that produces the edible cocoa-nuts, which are the
    produce of the cocoa-tree (Cocos nucifera), whereas the tree
    from which chocolate is procured is very different (the
    Theobroma cacao). The cocoa-tree was cultivated by the
    aboriginal inhabitants of South America, particularly in Mexico,
    where, according to Humboldt, it was reared by Montezuma. It was
    transplanted thence into other dependencies of the Spanish
    monarchy in 1520; and it was so highly esteemed by Linnaeus
    receive from him the name now conferred upon it, of Theobroma, a
    term derived from the Greek, and signifying "food for gods."
    Chocolate has always been a favourite beverage among the
    Spaniards and Creoles, and was considered here as a great luxury
    when first introduced, after the discovery of America; but the
    high duties laid upon it, confined it long almost entirely to
    the wealthier classes. Before it was subjected to duty, Mr.
    Bryan Edwards stated that cocoa plantations were numerous in
    Jamaica, but that the duty caused their almost entire ruin. The
    removal of this duty has increased their cultivation. (For
    engraving of cocoa-bean, see No. 1816.)

TO MAKE ESSENCE OF COFFEE.

1808. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1/4 lb. of ground coffee allow 1 small teaspoonful of powdered
chicory, 3 small teacupfuls, or 1 pint, of water.

Mode.--Let the coffee be freshly ground, and, if possible, freshly roasted; put it into a percolater,
or filter, with the chicory, and pour slowly over it the above proportion of boiling water.
When it has all filtered through, warm the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the simmering-point,
but do not allow it to boil; then filter it a second time, put it into a clean and dry bottle,
cork it well, and it will remain good for several days. Two tablespoonfuls of this essence
are quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk. This essence will be found particularly
useful to those persons who have to rise extremely early; and having only the milk to make
boiling, is very easily and quickly prepared. When the essence is bottled, pour another 3 tea-cupfuls
of boiling water slowly on the grounds, which, when filtered through, will be a very weak coffee.
The next time there is essence to be prepared, make this weak coffee boiling, and pour it on
the ground coffee instead of plain water: by this means a better coffee will be obtained. Never
throw away the grounds without having made use of them in this manner; and always cork the
bottle well that contains this preparation, until the day that it is wanted for making the
fresh essence.

Time.--To be filtered once, then brought to the boiling-point, and filtered again.

Average cost, with coffee at 1s. 8d. per lb., 6d.

Sufficient'-Allow 2 tablespoonfuls for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk.

TO ROAST COFFEE.

(A French Recipe.)

1809. It being an acknowledged fact that French coffee is decidedly superior to that made in
England, and as the roasting of the berry is of great importance to the flavour of the preparation,
it will be useful and interesting to know how they manage these things in France. In Paris,
there are two houses justly celebrated for the flavour of their coffee,--La Maison Corcellet
and La Maison Royer de Chartres; and to obtain this flavour, before roasting they add to every
3 lbs. of coffee a piece of butter the size of a nut, and a dessert-spoonful of powdered sugar:
it is then roasted in the usual manner. The addition of the butter and sugar develops the flavour
and aroma of the berry; but it must be borne in mind, that the quality of the butter must be
of the very best description.

TO MAKE COFFEE.

1810. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 4 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of ground coffee to each person; to every
oz. of coffee allow 1/3 pint of water.

Mode.--To make coffee good, it should never be boiled, but the boiling water merely poured
on it, the same as for tea. The coffee should always be purchased in the berry,--if possible,
freshly roasted; and it should never be ground long before it is wanted for use. There are
very many new kinds of coffee-pots, but the method of making the coffee is nearly always the
same; namely, pouring the boiling water on the powder, and allowing it to filter through. Our
illustration shows one of Loysel's Hydrostatic Urns, which are admirably adapted for making
good and clear coffee, which should be made in the following, manner:--Warm the urn with boiling
water, remove the lid and movable filter, and place the ground coffee at the bottom of the
urn. Put the movable filter over this, and screw the lid, inverted, tightly on the end of the
centre pipe. Pour into the inverted lid the above proportion of boiling water, and when all
the water so poured has disappeared from the funnel, and made its way down the centre pipe
and up again through the ground coffee by hydrostatic pressure, unscrew screw the lid and cover
the urn. Pour back direct into the urn, not through the funnel, one, two, or three cups, according
to the size of the percolater, in order to make the infusion of uniform strength; the contents
will then be ready for use, and should run from the tap strong, hot, and clear. The coffee
made in these urns generally turns out very good, and there is but one objection to them,--the
coffee runs rather slowly from the tap. This is of no consequence where there is a small party,
but tedious where there are many persons to provide for. A remedy for this objection may be
suggested; namely, to make the coffee very strong, so that not more than 1/3 of a cup would
be required, as the rest would be filled up with milk. Making coffee in filters or percolaters
does away with the necessity of using isinglass, white of egg, and various other preparations
to clear it. Coffee should always be served very hot, and, if possible, in the same vessel
in which it is made, as pouring it from one pot to another cools, and consequently spoils it.
Many persons may think that the proportion of water we have given for each oz. of coffee is
rather small; it is so, and the coffee produced from it will be very strong; 1/3 of a cup will
be found quite sufficient, which should be filled with nice hot milk, or milk and cream mixed.
This is the 'cafe au lait' for which our neighbours over the Channel are so justly celebrated.
Should the ordinary method of making coffee be preferred, use double the quantity of water,
and, in pouring it into the cups, put in more coffee and less milk.

Sufficient.--For very good coffee, allow 1/2 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, to each person.

A VERY SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE.

1811. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of coffee to each person; to every oz.
allow 1 pint of water.

Mode.--Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee-pot inside, and to this ring
sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the purpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into
the pot, pour some boiling water in it, and, when the pot is well warmed, put the ground coffee
into the bag; pour over as much boiling water as is required, close the lid, and, when all
the water has filtered through, remove the bag, and send the coffee to table. Making it in
this manner prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which
cools and spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee gradually, so that the infusion
may be stronger; and the bag must be well made, that none of the grounds may escape through
the seams, and so make the coffee thick and muddy.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 tablespoonful, or 1/2 oz., to each person.

    THE COFFEE PLANT grows to the height of about twelve or fifteen
    feet, with leaves not unlike those of the common laurel,
    although more pointed, and not so dry and thick. The blossoms
    are white, much like those of jasmine, and issue from the angles
    of the leaf-stalks. When the flowers fade, they are succeeded by
    the coffee-bean, or seed, which is inclosed in a berry of a red
    colour, when ripe resembling a cherry. The coffee-beans are
    prepared by exposing them to the sun for a few days, that the
    pulp may ferment and throw off a strong acidulous moisture. They
    are then gradually dried for about three weeks, and put into a
    mill to separate the husk from the seed.

CAFE AU LAIT.

1812. This is merely very strong coffee added to a large proportion of good hot milk; about
6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee being quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of milk. Of
the essence No. 1808, which answers admirably for 'cafe an lait', so much would not be required.
This preparation is infinitely superior to the weak watery coffee so often served at English
tables. A little cream mixed with the milk, if the latter cannot be depended on for richness,
improves the taste of the coffee, as also the richness of the beverage.

Sufficient.--6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee, or 2 tablespoonfuls of the essence, to a breakfast-cupful
of milk.

    TEA AND COFFEE.--It is true, says Liebig, that thousands have
    lived without a knowledge of tea and coffee; and daily
    experience teaches us that, under certain circumstances, they
    may be dispensed with without disadvantage to the merely animal
    functions; but it is an error, certainly, to conclude from this
    that they may be altogether dispensed with in reference to their
    effects; and it is a question whether, if we had no tea and no
    coffee, the popular instinct would not seek for and discover the
    means of replacing them. Science, which accuses us of so much in
    these respects, will have, in the first place, to ascertain
    whether it depends on sensual and sinful inclinations merely,
    that every people of the globe have appropriated some such means
    of acting on the nervous life, from the shore of the Pacific,
    where the Indian retires from life for days in order to enjoy
    the bliss of intoxication with koko, to the Arctic regions,
    where Kamtschatdales and Koriakes prepare an intoxicating
    beverage from a poisonous mushroom. We think it, on the
    contrary, highly probable, not to say certain, that the instinct
    of man, feeling certain blanks, certain wants of the intensified
    life of our times, which cannot be satisfied or filled up by
    mere quantity, has discovered, in these products of vegetable
    life the true means of giving to his food the desired and
    necessary quality.

CAFE NOIR.

1813. This is usually handed round after dinner, and should be drunk well sweetened, with the
addition of a little brandy or liqueurs, which may be added or not at pleasure. The coffee
should be made very strong, and served in very small cups, but never mixed with milk or cream.
Cafe noir may be made of the essence of coffee No. 1808, by pouring a tablespoonful into each
cup, and filling it up with boiling water. This is a very simple and expeditious manner of
preparing coffee for a large party, but the essence for it must be made very good, and kept
well corked until required for use.

TO MAKE TEA.

1814. There is very little art in making good tea; if the water is boiling, and there is no
sparing of the fragrant leaf, the beverage will almost invariably be good. The old-fashioned
plan of allowing a teaspoonful to each person, and one over, is still practised. Warm the teapot
with boiling water; let it remain for two or three minutes for the vessel to become thoroughly
hot, then pour it away. Put in the tea, pour in from 1/2 to 3/4 pint of boiling water, close
the lid, and let it stand for the tea to draw from 5 to 10 minutes; then fill up the pot with
water. The tea will be quite spoiled unless made with water that is actually 'boiling', as
the leaves will not open, and the flavour not be extracted from them; the beverage will consequently
be colourless and tasteless,--in fact, nothing but tepid water. Where there is a very large
party to make tea for, it is a good plan to have two teapots instead of putting a large quantity
of tea into one pot; the tea, besides, will go farther. When the infusion has been once completed,
the addition of fresh tea adds very little to the strength; so, when more is required, have
the pot emptied of the old leaves, scalded, and fresh tea made in the usual manner. Economists
say that a few grains of carbonate of soda, added before the boiling water is poured on the
tea, assist to draw out the goodness: if the water is very hard, perhaps it is a good plan,
as the soda softens it; but care must be taken to use this ingredient sparingly, as it is liable
to give the tea a soapy taste if added in too large a quantity. For mixed tea, the usual proportion
is four spoonfuls of black to one of green; more of the latter when the flavour is very much
liked; but strong green tea is highly pernicious, and should never be partaken of too freely.

Time.--2 minutes to warm the teapot, 5 to 10 minutes to draw the strength from the tea.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 teaspoonful to each person, and one over.

    TEA.--The tea-tree or shrub belongs to the class and order of
    Monadelphia polyandria in the Linnaean system, and to the
    natural order of Aurantiaceae in the system of Jussieu. Lately
    it has been made into a new order, the Theasia, which includes
    the Camellia and some other plants. It commonly grows to the
    height of from three to six feet; but it is said, that, in its
    wild or native state, it reaches twenty feet or more. In China
    it is cultivated in numerous small plantations. In its general
    appearance, and the form of its leaf, it resembles the myrtle.
    The blossoms are white and fragrant, not unlike those of the
    wild rose, but smaller; and they are succeeded by soft green
    capsules, containing each from one to three white seeds. These
    capsules are crushed for oil, which is in general use in China.

AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR MILK OR CREAM IN TEA OR COFFEE.

1815. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1 new-laid egg to every large breakfast-cupful of tea or coffee.

Mode.--Beat up the whole of the egg in a basin, put it into a cup (or a portion of it, if the
cup be small), and pour over it the tea or coffee very hot. These should be added very gradually,
and stirred all the time, to prevent the egg from curdling. In point of nourishment, both these
beverages are much improved by this addition.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 egg to every large breakfast-cupful of tea or coffee.

TO MAKE COCOA.

1816. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 2 teaspoonfuls of the prepared cocoa to 1 breakfast-cup; boiling
milk and boiling water.

Mode.--Put the cocoa into a breakfast-cup, pour over it sufficient cold milk to make it into
a smooth paste; then add equal quantities of boiling milk and boiling water, and stir all well
together. Care must be taken not to allow the milk to get burnt, as it will entirely spoil
the flavour of the preparation. The above directions are usually given for making the prepared
cocoa. The rock cocoa, or that bought in a solid piece, should be scraped, and made in the
same manner, taking care to rub down all the lumps before the boiling liquid is added.

Sufficient--2 teaspoonfuls of prepared cocoa for 1 breakfast-cup, or 1/4 oz. of the rock cocoa
for the same quantity.

COWSLIP WINE.

1817. INGREDIENTS.--To every gallon of water allow 3 lbs. of lump sugar, the rind of 2 lemons,
the juice of 1, the rind and juice of 1 Seville orange, 1 gallon of cowslip pips. To every
4-1/2 gallons of wine allow 1 bottle of brandy.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/2 hour, carefully removing all the scum as it
rises. Pour this boiling liquor on the orange and lemon-rinds, and the juice, which should
be strained; when milk-warm, add the cowslip pips or flowers, picked from the stalks and seeds;
and to 9 gallons of wine 3 tablespoonfuls of good fresh brewers' yeast. Let it ferment 3 or
4 days; then put all together in a cask with the brandy, and let it remain for 2 months, when
bottle it off for use.

Time.--To be boiled 1/2 hour; to ferment 3 or 4 days; to remain in the cask 2 months.

Average cost, exclusive of the cowslips, which may be picked in the fields, 2s. 9d. per gallon.

Seasonable.--Make this in April or May.

ELDER WINE.

1818. INGREDIENTS.--To every 3 gallons of water allow 1 peck of elderberries; to every gallon
of juice allow 3 lbs. of sugar, 1/2 oz. of ground ginger, 6 cloves, 1 lb. of good Turkey raisins;
1/2 pint of brandy to every gallon of wine. To every 9 gallons of wine 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls
of fresh brewer's yeast.

Mode.--Pour the water, quite boiling, on the elderberries, which should be picked from the
stalks, and let these stand covered for 24 hours; then strain the whole through a sieve or
bag, breaking the fruit to express all the juice from it. Measure the liquor, and to every
gallon allow the above proportion of sugar. Boil the juice and sugar with the ginger, cloves,
and raisins for 1 hour, skimming the liquor the whole time; let it stand until milk-warm, then
put it into a clean dry cask, with 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of good fresh yeast to every 9 gallons
of wine. Let it ferment for about a fortnight; then add the brandy, bung up the cask, and let
it stand some months before it is bottled, when it will be found excellent. A bunch of hops
suspended to a string from the bung, some persons say, will preserve the wine good for several
years. Elder wine is usually mulled, and served with sippets of toasted bread and a little
grated nutmeg.

Time.--To stand covered 24 hours; to be boiled 1 hour.

Average cost, when made at home, 3s. 6d. per gallon.

Seasonable.--Make this in September.

    ELDER-BERRY WINE.--The elder-berry is well adapted for the
    production of wine; its juice contains a considerable portion of
    the principle necessary for a vigorous fermentation, and its
    beautiful colour communicates a rich tint to the wine made from
    it. It is, however, deficient in sweetness, and therefore
    demands an addition of sugar. It is one of the very best of the
    genuine old English wines; and a cup of it mulled, just previous
    to retiring to bed on a winter night, is a thing to be "run
    for," as Cobbett would say: it is not, however, agreeable to
    every taste.

GINGER WINE.

1819. INGREDIENTS.--To 9 gallons of water allow 27 lbs. of loaf sugar, 9 lemons, 12 oz. of
bruised ginger, 3 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 2 lbs. of raisins stoned and chopped, 1 pint of brandy.

Mode.--Boil together for 1 hour in a copper (let it previously be well scoured and beautifully
clean) the water, sugar, lemon-rinds, and bruised ginger; remove every particle of scum as
it rises, and when the liquor is sufficiently boiled, put it into a large tub or pan, as it
must not remain in the copper. When nearly cold, add the yeast, which must be thick and very
fresh, and, the next day, put all in a dry cask with the strained lemon-juice and chopped raisins.
Stir the wine every day for a fortnight; then add the brandy, stop the cask down by degrees,
and in a few weeks it will be fit to bottle.

Average cost, 2s. per gallon. Sufficient to make 9 gallons of wine.

Seasonable.--The best time for making this wine is either in March or September.

Note.--Wine made early in March will be fit to bottle in June.

GOOSEBERRY VINEGAR.

(An Excellent Recipe.)

1820. INGREDIENTS.--2 pecks of crystal gooseberries, 6 gallons of water, 12 lbs. of foots sugar
of the coarsest brown quality.

Mode.--Mash the gooseberries (which should be quite ripe) in a tub with a mallet; put to them
the water nearly milk-warm; let this stand 24 hours; then strain it through a sieve, and put
the sugar to it; mix it well, and tun it. These proportions are for a 9-gallon cask; and if
it be not quite full, more water must be added. Let the mixture be stirred from the bottom
of the cask two or three times daily for three or four days, to assist the melting of the sugar;
then paste a piece of linen cloth over the bunghole, and set the cask in a warm place, but
not in the sun; any corner of a warm kitchen is the best situation for it. The following spring
it should be drawn off into stone bottles, and the vinegar will be fit for use twelve months
after it is made. This will be found a most excellent preparation, greatly superior to much
that is sold under the name of the best white wine vinegar. Many years' experience has proved
that pickle made with this vinegar will keep, when bought vinegar will not preserve the ingredients.
The cost per gallon is merely nominal, especially to those who reside in the country and grow
their own gooseberries; the coarse sugar is then the only ingredient to be purchased.

Time.--To remain in the cask 9 months.

Average cost, when the gooseberries have to be purchased, 1s. per gallon; when they are grown
at home, 6d. per gallon.

Seasonable.--This should be made the end of June or the beginning of July, when gooseberries
are ripe and plentiful.

EFFERVESCING GOOSEBERRY WINE.

1821. INGREDIENTS.--To every gallon of water allow 6 lbs. of green gooseberries, 3 lbs. of
lump sugar.

Mode.--This wine should be prepared from unripe gooseberries, in order to avoid the flavour
which the fruit would give to the wine when in a mature state. Its briskness depends more upon
the time of bottling than upon the unripe state of the fruit, for effervescing wine can be
made from fruit that is ripe as well as that which is unripe. The fruit should be selected
when it has nearly attained its full growth, and consequently before it shows any tendency
to ripen. Any bruised or decayed berries, and those that are very small, should be rejected.
The blossom and stalk ends should be removed, and the fruit well bruised in a tub or pan, in
such quantities as to insure each berry being broken without crushing the seeds. Pour the water
(which should be warm) on the fruit, squeeze and stir it with the hand until all the pulp is
removed from the skin and seeds, and cover the whole closely for 24 hours; after which, strain
it through a coarse bag, and press it with as much force as can be conveniently applied, to
extract the whole of the juice and liquor the fruit may contain. To every 40 or 50 lbs. of
fruit one gallon more of hot water may be passed through the marc, or husks, in order to obtain
any soluble matter that may remain, and be again pressed. The juice should be put into a tub
or pan of sufficient size to contain all of it, and the sugar added to it. Let it be well stirred
until the sugar is dissolved, and place the pan in a warm situation; keep it closely covered,
and let it ferment for a day or two. It must then be drawn off into clean casks, placed a little
on one side for the scum that arises to be thrown out, and the casks kept filled with the remaining
"must," that should be reserved for that purpose. When the active fermentation has ceased,
the casks should be plugged upright, again filled, if necessary, the bungs be put in loosely,
and, after a few days, when the fermentation is a little more languid (which may be known,
by the hissing noise ceasing), the bungs should be driven in tight, and a spile-hole made,
to give vent if necessary. About November or December, on a clear fine day, the wine should
he racked from its lees into clean casks, which may be rinsed with brandy. After a month, it
should be examined to see if it is sufficiently clear for bottling; if not, it must be fined
with isinglass, which may be dissolved in some of the wine: 1 oz. will be sufficient for 9
gallons. In March or April, or when the gooseberry bushes begin to blossom, the wine must be
bottled, in order to insure its being effervescing.

Seasonable.--Make this the end of May or beginning of June, before the berries ripen.

LEMON SYRUP.

1822. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 2 pints of water, 1 oz. of citric acid, 12 drachm
of essence of lemon.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/4 hour, and put it into a basin, where let it
remain till cold. Beat the citric acid to a powder, mix the essence of lemon with it, then
add these two ingredients to the syrup; mix well, and bottle for use. Two tablespoonfuls of
the syrup are sufficient for a tumbler of cold water, and will be found a very refreshing summer
drink.

Sufficient--2 tablespoonfuls of syrup to a tumbler-ful of cold water.

LEMON WINE.

1823. INGREDIENTS.--To 4-1/2 gallons of water allow the pulp of 50 lemons, the rind of 25,
16 lbs. of loaf sugar,--1/2 oz. of isinglass, 1 bottle of brandy.

Mode.--Peel and slice the lemons, but use only the rind of 25 of them, and put them into the
cold water. Let it stand 8 or 9 days, squeezing the lemons well every day; then strain the
water off and put it into a cask with the sugar. Let it work some time, and when it has ceased
working, put in the isinglass. Stop the cask down; in about six months put in the brandy and
bottle the wine off.

Seasonable.--The best time to make this is in January or February, when lemons are best and
cheapest.

MALT WINE.

1824. INGREDIENTS.--5 gallons of water, 28 lbs. of sugar, 6 quarts of sweet-wort, 6 quarts
of tun, 3 lbs. of raisins, 1/2 lb. of candy, 1 pint of brandy.

Mode.--Boil the sugar and water together for 10 minutes; skim it well, and put the liquor into
a convenient-sized pan or tub. Allow it to cool; then mix it with the sweet-wort and tun. Let
it stand for 3 days, then put it into a barrel; here it will work or ferment for another three
days or more; then bung up the cask, and keep it undisturbed for 2 or 3 months. After this,
add the raisins (whole), the candy, and brandy, and, in 6 months' time, bottle the wine off.
Those who do not brew, may procure the sweet-wort and tun from any brewer. Sweet-wort is the
liquor that leaves the mash of malt before it is boiled with the hops; tun is the new beer
after the whole of the brewing operation has been completed.

Time.--To be boiled 10 minutes; to stand 3 days after mixing; to ferment 3 days; to remain
in the cask 2 mouths before the raisins are added; bottle 6 months after.

Seasonable.--Make this in March or October.

HOME-MADE NOYEAU.

1825. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of bitter almonds, 1 oz. of sweet ditto, 1 lb. of loaf sugar, the
rinds of 3 lemons, 1 quart of Irish whiskey or gin, 1 tablespoonful of clarified honey, 4 pint
of new milk.

Mode.--Blanch and pound the almonds, and mix with them the sugar, which should also be pounded.
Boil the milk; let it stand till quite cold; then mix all the ingredients together, and let
them remain for 10 days, shaking them every day. Filter the mixture through blotting-paper,
bottle off for use in small bottles, and seal the corks down. This will be found useful for
flavouring many sweet dishes.

Average cost, 2s. 9d.

Sufficient to make about 24 pints of Noyeau.

Seasonable.--May be made at any time.

ORANGE BRANDY.

(Excellent.)

1826. Mix the brandy with the orange-juice, strained, the rinds of 6 of the oranges pared very
thin, and the sugar. Let all stand in a closely-covered jar for about 3 days, stirring it 3
or 4 times a day. When clear, it should be bottled and closely corked for a year; it will then
be ready for use, but will keep any length of time. This is a most excellent stomachic when
taken pure in small quantities; or, as the strength of the brandy is very little deteriorated
by the other ingredients, it may be diluted with water.

Time.--To be stirred every day for 3 days.

Average cost, 7s.

Sufficient to make 2 quarts. Seasonable.--Make this in March.

A VERY SIMPLE AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING A VERY SUPERIOR ORANGE WINE.

1827. INGREDIENTS.--90 Seville oranges, 32 lbs. of lump sugar, water.

Mode.--Break up the sugar into small pieces, and put it into a dry, sweet 9-gallon cask, placed
in a cellar or other storehouse, where it is intended to be kept. Have ready close to the cask
two large pans or wooden keelers, into one of which put the peel of the oranges pared quite
thin, and into the other the pulp after the juice has been squeezed from it. Strain the juice
through a piece of double muslin, and put it into the cask with the sugar. Then pour about
1-1/2 gallon of cold spring water on both the peels and pulp; let it stand for 24 hours, and
then strain it into the cask; add more water to the peels and pulp when this is done, and repeat
the same process every day for a week: it should take about a week to fill up the cask. Be
careful to apportion the quantity as nearly as possible to the seven days, and to stir the
contents of the cask each day. On the ''third' day after the cask is full,--that is, the 'tenth'
day after the commencement of making,--the cask may be securely bunged down. This is a very
simple and easy method, and the wine made according to it will be pronounced to be most excellent.
There is no troublesome boiling, and all fermentation takes place in the cask. When the above
directions are attended to, the wine cannot fail to be good. It should be bottled in 8 or 9
months, and will be fit for use in a twelve month after the time of making. Ginger wine may
be made in precisely the same manner, only, with the 9-gallon cask for ginger wine, 2 lbs.
of the best whole ginger, 'bruised', must be put with the sugar. It will be found convenient
to tie the ginger loosely in a muslin bag.

Time.--Altogether, 10 days to make it.

Average cost, 2s. 6d. per gallon. Sufficient for 9 gallons.

Seasonable.--Make this in March, and bottle it the following January.

RASPBERRY VINEGAR.

1828. INGREDIENTS.--To every 3 pints of the best vinegar allow 4-1/2 pints of freshly-gathered
raspberries; to each pint of liquor allow 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar, 1 wineglassful of brandy.

Mode.--Let the raspberries be freshly gathered; pick them from the stalks, and put 1-1/2 pint
of them into a stone jar; pour 3 pints of the best vinegar over them, and let them remain for
24 hours; then strain the liquor over another 1-1/2 pint of fresh raspberries. Let them remain
another 24 hours, and the following day repeat the process for the third time; then drain off
the liquor without pressing, and pass it through a jelly-bag (previously wetted with plain
vinegar), into a stone jar. Add to every pint of the liquor 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar; stir
them together, and, when the sugar is dissolved, cover the jar; set it upon the fire in a saucepan
of boiling water, and let it boil for an hour, removing the scum as fast as it rises; add to
each pint a glass of brandy, bottle it, and seal the corks. This is an excellent drink in cases
of fevers and colds: it should be diluted with cold water, according to the taste or requirement
of the patient.

Time.--To be boiled 1 hour. Average cost, 1s. per pint.

Sufficient to make 2 quarts.

Seasonable.--Make this in July or August, when raspberries are most plentiful.

RHUBARB WINE.

1829.

Mode.--Gather the rhubarb about the middle of May; wipe it with a wet cloth, and, with a mallet,
bruise it in a large wooden tub or other convenient means. When reduced to a pulp, weigh it,
and to every 5 lbs. add 1 gallon of cold spring water; let these remain for 3 days, stirring
3 or 4 times a day; and, on the fourth day, press the pulp through a hair sieve; put the liquor
into a tub, and to every gallon put 3 lbs. of loaf sugar; stir in the sugar until it is quite
dissolved, and add the lemon-rind; let the liquor remain, and, in 4, 5, or 6 days, the fermentation
will begin to subside, and a crust or head will be formed, which should be skimmed off, or
the liquor drawn from it, when the crust begins to crack or separate. Put the wine into a cask,
and if, after that, it ferments, rack it off into another cask, and in a fortnight stop it
down. If the wine should have lost any of its original sweetness, add a little more loaf sugar,
taking care that the cask is full. Bottle it off in February or March, and in the summer it
should be fit to drink. It will improve greatly by keeping; and, should a very brilliant colour
be desired, add a little currant-juice.

Seasonable.--Make this about the middle of May.

WELSH NECTAR.

1830. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of raisins, 3 lemons, 2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 2 gallons of boiling water.

Mode.--Cut the peel of the lemons very thin, pour upon it the boiling water, and, when cool,
add the strained juice of the lemons, the sugar, and the raisins, stoned and chopped very fine.
Let it stand 4 or 5 days, stirring it every day; then strain it through a jelly-bag, and bottle
it for present use.

Time.--4 or 5 days. Average cost, 1s. 9d.

Sufficient to make 2 gallons.

CLARET-CUP.

1831. INGREDIENTS.--1 bottle of claret, 1 bottle of soda-water, about 1/2 lb. of pounded ice,
4 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 liqueur-glass of Maraschino,
a sprig of green borage.

Mode.--Put all the ingredients into a silver cup, regulating the proportion of ice by the state
of the weather: if very warm, a larger quantity would be necessary. Hand the cup round with
a clean napkin passed through one of the handles, that the edge of the cup may be wiped after
each guest has partaken of the contents thereof.

Seasonable in summer.

    CLARETS.--All those wines called in England clarets are the
    produce of the country round Bordeaux, or the Bordelais; but it
    is remarkable that there is no pure wine in France known by the
    name of claret, which is a corruption of clairet, a term that
    is applied there to any red or rose-coloured wine. Round
    Bordeaux are produced a number of wines of the first quality,
    which pass under the name simply of vins de Bordeaux, or have
    the designation of the particular district where they are made;
    as Lafitte, Latour, &c. The clarets brought to the English
    market are frequently prepared for it by the wine-growers by
    mixing together several Bordeaux wines, or by adding to them a
    portion of some other wines; but in France the pure wines are
    carefully preserved distinct. The genuine wines of Bordeaux are
    of great variety, that part being one of the most distinguished
    in France; and the principal vineyards are those of Medoc,
    Palus, Graves, and Blanche, the product of each having
    characters considerably different.

CHAMPAGNE-CUP.

1832. Should the above proportion of sugar not be found sufficient to suit some tastes, increase
the quantity. When borage is not easily obtainable, substitute for it a few slices of cucumber-rind.

Seasonable.--Suitable for pic-nics, balls, weddings, and other festive occasions.

    CHAMPAGNE.--This, the most celebrated of French wines, is the
    produce chiefly of the province of that name, and is generally
    understood in England to be a brisk, effervescing, or sparkling
    white wine, of a very fine flavour; but this is only one of the
    varieties of this class. There is both red and white champagne,
    and each of these may be either still or brisk. There are the
    sparkling wines (mousseux), and the still wines (non-mousseux).
    The brisk are in general the most highly esteemed, or, at least,
    are the most popular in this country, on account of their
    delicate flavour and the agreeable pungency which they derive
    from the carbonic acid they contain, and to which they owe their
    briskness.

GINGER BEER.

1833. INGREDIENTS.--2-1/2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 1-1/2 oz. of bruised ginger, 1 oz. of cream of
tartar, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 3 gallons of boiling water, 2 large tablespoonfuls
of thick and fresh brewer's yeast.

Mode.--Peel the lemons, squeeze the juice, strain it, and put the peel and juice into a large
earthen pan, with the bruised ginger, cream of tartar, and loaf sugar. Pour over these ingredients
3 gallons of boiling water; let it stand until just warm, when add the yeast, which should
be thick and perfectly fresh. Stir the contents of the pan well, and let them remain near the
fire all night, covering the pan over with a cloth. The next day skim off the yeast, and pour
the liquor carefully into another vessel, leaving the sediment; then bottle immediately, and
tie the corks down, and in 3 days the ginger beer will be fit for use. For some tastes, the
above proportion of sugar may be found rather too large, when it may be diminished; but the
beer will not keep so long good.

Average cost for this quantity, 2s.; or 1/2d. per bottle.

Sufficient to fill 4 dozen ginger-beer bottles.

Seasonable.--This should be made during the summer months.

LEMONADE.

1834. INGREDIENTS--The rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 3 large or 4 small ones, 1 lb. of loaf
sugar, 1 quart of boiling water.

Mode.--Rub some of the sugar, in lumps, on 2 of the lemons until they have imbibed all the
oil from them, and put it with the remainder of the sugar into a jug; add the lemon-juice (but
no pips), and pour over the whole a quart of boiling water. When the sugar is dissolved, strain
the lemonade through a fine sieve or piece of muslin, and, when cool, it will be ready for
use. The lemonade will be much improved by having the white of an egg beaten up in it; a little
sherry mixed with it, also, makes this beverage much nicer.

Average cost, 6d. per quart.

    LEMONADE--"There is a current opinion among women" says Brillat
    Savarin "which every year causes the death of many young
    women,--that acids, especially vinegar, are preventives of
    obesity. Beyond all doubt, acids have the effect of destroying
    obesity; but they also destroy health and freshness. Lemonade
    is, of all acids, the most harmless; but few stomachs can resist
    it long. I knew, in 1776, at Dijon, a young lady of great
    beauty, to whom I was attached by bonds of friendship, great,
    almost as those of love. One day, when she had for some time
    gradually grown pale and thin (previously she had a slight
    embonpoint), she told me in confidence, that as her young
    friends had ridiculed her for being fat, she had, to counteract
    the tendency, been in the habit every day of drinking a large
    glass of vinaigre. She died at eighteen years of age, from the
    effects of these potions."

TO MAKE NEGUS.

1835. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of port wine allow 1 quart of boiling water, 1/4 lb. of sugar,
1 lemon, grated nutmeg to taste.

Mode.--As this beverage is more usually drunk at children's parties than at any other, the
wine need not be very old or expensive for the purpose, a new fruity wine answering very well
for it. Put the wine into a jug, rub some lumps of sugar (equal to 1/4 lb.) on the lemon-rind
until all the yellow part of the skin is absorbed, then squeeze the juice, and strain it. Add
the sugar and lemon-juice to the port wine, with the grated nutmeg; pour over it the boiling
water, cover the jug, and, when the beverage has cooled a little, it will be fit for use. Negus
may also be made of sherry, or any other sweet white wine, but is more usually made of port
than of any other beverage.

Sufficient--Allow 1 pint of wine, with the other ingredients in proportion, for a party of
9 or 10 children.

A PLEASANT DRINK FOR WARM WEATHER.

1836. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1-1/2 pint of good ale allow 1 bottle of ginger beer. Mode.--For
this beverage the ginger beer must be in an effervescing state, and the beer not in the least
turned or sour. Mix them together, and drink immediately. The draught is refreshing and wholesome,
as the ginger corrects the action of the beer. It does not deteriorate by standing a little,
but, of course, is better when taken fresh.

FOR A SUMMER DRAUGHT.

1837. INGREDIENTS.--The juice of 1 lemon, a tumbler-ful of cold water, pounded sugar to taste,
4 small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.

Mode.--Squeeze the juice from the lemon; strain, and add it to the water, with sufficient pounded
sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. When well mixed, put in the soda, stir well, and drink while
the mixture is in an effervescing state.

TO MULL WINE.

1838. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of wine allow 1 large cupful of water, sugar and spice to taste.

Mode.--In making preparations like the above, it is very difficult to give the exact proportions
of ingredients like sugar and spice, as what quantity might suit one person would be to another
quite distasteful. Boil the spice in the water until the flavour is extracted, then add the
wine and sugar, and bring the whole to the boiling-point, when serve with strips of crisp dry
toast, or with biscuits. The spices usually used for mulled wine are cloves, grated nutmeg,
and cinnamon or mace. Any kind of wine may be mulled, but port and claret are those usually
selected for the purpose; and the latter requires a very large proportion of sugar. The vessel
that the wine is boiled in must be delicately clean, and should be kept exclusively for the
purpose. Small tin warmers may be purchased for a trifle, which are more suitable than saucepans,
as, if the latter are not scrupulously clean, they will spoil the wine, by imparting to it
a very disagreeable flavour. These warmers should be used for no other purposes.

TO MAKE HOT PUNCH.

1839. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of rum, 1/2 pint of brandy, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1 large lemon, 1/2
teaspoonful of nutmeg, 1 pint of boiling water.

Mode.--Rub the sugar over the lemon until it has absorbed all the yellow part of the skin,
then put the sugar into a punchbowl; add the lemon-juice (free from pips), and mix these two
ingredients well together. Pour over them the boiling water, stir well together, add the rum,
brandy, and nutmeg; mix thoroughly, and the punch will be ready to serve. It is very important
in making good punch that all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated; and, to insure success,
the processes of mixing must be diligently attended to.

Sufficient.--Allow a quart for 4 persons; but this information must be taken cum grano salis;
for the capacities of persons for this kind of beverage are generally supposed to vary considerably.

    PUNCH is a beverage made of various spirituous liquors or wine,
    hot water, the acid juice of fruits, and sugar. It is considered
    to be very intoxicating; but this is probably because the
    spirit, being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the
    sugar, its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it
    really is. Punch, which was almost universally drunk among the
    middle classes about fifty or sixty years ago, has almost
    disappeared from our domestic tables, being superseded by wine.
    There are many different varieties of punch. It is sometimes
    kept cold in bottles, and makes a most agreeable summer drink.
    In Scotland, instead of the Madeira or sherry generally used in
    its manufacture, whiskey is substituted, and then its insidious
    properties are more than usually felt. Where fresh lemons cannot
    be had for punch or similar beverages, crystallized citric acid
    and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the
    same thing. In the composition of "Regent's punch," champagne,
    brandy, and veritable Martinique are required; "Norfolk punch"
    requires Seville oranges; "Milk punch" may be extemporized by
    adding a little hot milk to lemonade, and then straining it
    through a jelly-bag. Then there are "Wine punch," "Tea punch,"
    and "French punch," made with lemons, spirits, and wine, in
    fantastic proportions. But of all the compounds of these
    materials, perhaps, for a summer drink, the North-American
    "mint julep" is the most inviting. As the ice melts, you drink."
    The Virginians, say Captain Marryat, claim the merit of having
    invented this superb compound; but, from a passage in the
    "Comus" of Milton, he claims it for his own country.

WHISKEY CORDIAL.

1840. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of ripe white currants, the rind of 2 lemons, 1/4 oz. of grated ginger,
1 quart of whiskey, 1 lb. of lump sugar.

Mode.--Strip the currants from the stalks; put them into a large jug; add the lemon-rind, ginger,
and whiskey; cover the jug closely, and let it remain covered for 24 hours. Strain through
a hair sieve, add the lump sugar, and let it stand 12 hours longer; then bottle, and cork well.

Time.--To stand 24 hours before being strained; 12 hours after the sugar is added.

Seasonable.--Make this in July.

INVALID COOKERY.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

A FEW RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN COOKING FOR INVALIDS.

1841. LET all the kitchen utensils used in the preparation of invalids' cookery be delicately
and 'scrupulously clean;' if this is not the case, a disagreeable flavour may be imparted to
the preparation, which flavour may disgust, and prevent the patient from partaking of the refreshment
when brought to him or her.

1842. For invalids, never make a large quantity of one thing, as they seldom require much at
a time; and it is desirable that variety be provided for them.

1843. Always have something in readiness; a little beef tea, nicely made and nicely skimmed,
a few spoonfuls of jelly, &c. &c., that it may be administered as soon almost as the invalid
wishes for it. If obliged to wait a long time, the patient loses the desire to eat, and often
turns against the food when brought to him or her.

1844. In sending dishes or preparations up to invalids, let everything look as tempting as
possible. Have a clean tray-cloth laid smoothly over the tray; let the spoons, tumblers, cups
and saucers, &c., be very clean and bright. Gruel served in a tumbler is more appetizing than
when served in a basin or cup and saucer.

1845. As milk is an important article of food for the sick, in warm weather let it be kept
on ice, to prevent its turning sour. Many other delicacies may also be preserved good in the
same manner for some little time.

1846. If the patient be allowed to eat vegetables, never send them up undercooked, or half
raw; and let a small quantity only be temptingly arranged on a dish. This rule will apply to
every preparation, as an invalid is much more likely to enjoy his food if small delicate pieces
are served to him.

1847. Never leave food about a sick room; if the patient cannot eat it when brought to him,
take it away, and bring it to him in an hour or two's time. Miss Nightingale says, "To leave
the patient's untasted food by his side, from meal to meal, in hopes that he will eat it in
the interval, is simply to prevent him from taking any food at all." She says, "I have known
patients literally incapacitated from taking one article of food after another by this piece
of ignorance. Let the food come at the right time, and be taken away, eaten or uneaten, at
the right time, but never let a patient have 'something always standing' by him, if you don't
wish to disgust him of everything."

1848. Never serve beef tea or broth with the smallest particle of fat or grease on the surface.
It is better, after making either of these, to allow them to get perfectly cold, when all the
fat may be easily removed; then warm up as much as may be required. Two or three pieces of
clean whity-brown paper laid on the broth will absorb any greasy particles that may be floating
at the top, as the grease will cling to the paper.

1849. Roast mutton, chickens, rabbits, calves' feet or head, game, fish (simply dressed), and
simple puddings, are all light food, and easily digested. Of course, these things are only
partaken of, supposing the patient is recovering.

1850. A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed, and broiled to a turn, is a dish to be recommended
for invalids; but it must not be served with all the fat at the end, nor must it be too thickly
cut. Let it be cooked over a fire free from smoke, and sent up with the gravy in it, between
two very hot plates. Nothing is more disagreeable to an invalid than smoked food.

1851. In making toast-and-water, never blacken the bread, but toast it only a nice brown. Never
leave toast-and-water to make until the moment it is required, as it cannot then be properly
prepared,--at least, the patient will be obliged to drink it warm, which is anything but agreeable.

1852. In boiling eggs for invalids, let the white be just set; if boiled hard, they will be
likely to disagree with the patient.

1853. In Miss Nightingale's admirable "Notes on Nursing," a book that no mother or nurse should
be without, she says,--"You cannot be too careful as to quality in sick diet. A nurse should
never put before a patient milk that is sour, meat or soup that is turned, an egg that is bad,
or vegetables underdone." Yet often, she says, she has seen these things brought in to the
sick, in a state perfectly perceptible to every nose or eye except the nurse's. It is here
that the clever nurse appears,--she will not bring in the peccant article; but, not to disappoint
the patient, she will whip up something else in a few minutes. Remember, that sick cookery
should half do the work of your poor patient's weak digestion.

1854. She goes on to caution nurses, by saying,--"Take care not to spill into your patient's
saucer; in other words, take care that the outside bottom rim of his cup shall be quite dry
and clean. If, every time he lifts his cup to his lips, he has to carry the saucer with it,
or else to drop the liquid upon and to soil his sheet, or bedgown, or pillow, or, if he is
sitting up, his dress, you have no idea what a difference this minute want of care on your
part makes to his comfort, and even to his willingness for food."

RECIPES.

CHAPTER XXXIX.

TO MAKE ARROWROOT.

1855. INGREDIENTS.--Two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, 3 tablespoonfuls of cold water, 1/2 pint
of boiling water.

Mode.--Mix the arrowroot smoothly in a basin with the cold water, then pour on it the boiling
water, stirring all the time. The water must be boiling at the time it is poured on the mixture,
or it will not thicken; if mixed with hot water only, it must be put into a clean saucepan,
and boiled until it thickens; but this is more trouble, and quite unnecessary if the water
is boiling at first. Put the arrowroot into a tumbler, sweeten it with lump sugar, and flavour
it with grated nutmeg or cinnamon, or a piece of lemon-peel, or, when allowed, 3 tablespoonfuls
of port or sherry. As arrowroot is in itself flavourless and insipid, it is almost necessary
to add the wine to make it palatable. Arrowroot made with milk instead of water is far nicer,
but is not so easily digested. It should be mixed in the same manner, with 3 tablespoonfuls
of cold water, the boiling milk then poured on it, and well stirred. When made in this manner,
no wine should be added, but merely sugar, and a little grated nutmeg or lemon-peel.

Time.--If obliged to be boiled, 2 minutes. Average cost, 2d. per pint.

Sufficient to make 1/2 pint of arrowroot.

    MISS NIGHTINGALE says, in her "Notes on Nursing," that arrowroot
    is a grand dependence of the nurse. As a vehicle for wine, and
    as a restorative quickly prepared, it is all very well, but it
    is nothing but starch and water; flour is both more nutritive
    and less liable to ferment, and is preferable wherever it can be
    used.

BARLEY GRUEL.

1856. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of Scotch or pearl barley, 1/2 pint of port wine, the rind of 1 lemon,
1 quart and 1/2 pint of water, sugar to taste.

Mode.--After well washing the barley, boil it in 1/2 pint of water for 1/4 hour; then pour
this water away; put to the barley the quart of fresh boiling water, and let it boil until
the liquid is reduced to half; then strain it off. Add the wine, sugar, and lemon-peel; simmer
for 5 minutes, and put it away in a clean jug. It can be warmed from time to time, as required.

Time.--To be boiled until reduced to half. Average cost, 1s. 6d.

Sufficient with the wine to make 1-1/2 pint of gruel.

TO MAKE BARLEY-WATER.

1857. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of pearl barley, 2 quarts of boiling water, 1 pint of cold water.
It may be flavoured with lemon-peel, after being sweetened, or a small piece may be simmered
with the barley. When the invalid may take it, a little lemon-juice gives this pleasant drink
in illness a very nice flavour.

Time.--To boil until the liquid is reduced one half.

Sufficient to make 1 quart of barley-water.

TO MAKE BEEF TEA.

1858. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of lean gravy-beef, 1 quart of water, 1 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Have the meat cut without fat and bone, and choose a nice fleshy piece. Cut it into
small pieces about the size of dice, and put it into a clean saucepan. Add the water cold to
it; put it on the fire, and bring it to the boiling-point; then skim well. Put in the salt
when the water boils, and simmer the beef tea gently from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, removing any more
scum should it appear on the surface. Strain the tea through a hair sieve, and set it by in
a cool place. When wanted for use, remove every particle of fat from the top; warm up as much
as may be required, adding, if necessary, a little more salt. This preparation is simple beef
tea, and is to be administered to those invalids to whom flavourings and seasonings are not
allowed. When the patient is very low, use double the quantity of meat to the same proportion
of water. Should the invalid be able to take the tea prepared in a more palatable manner, it
is easy to make it so by following the directions in the next recipe, which is an admirable
one for making savoury beef tea. Beef tea is always better when made the day before it is wanted,
and then warmed up. It is a good plan to put the tea into a small cup or basin, and to place
this basin in a saucepan of boiling water. When the tea is warm, it is ready to serve.

Time.--1/4 to 3/4 hour. Average cost, 6d. per pint.

Sufficient.--Allow 1 lb. of meat for a pint of good beef tea.

    MISS NIGHTINGALE says, one of the most common errors among
    nurses, with respect to sick diet, is the belief that beef tea
    is the most nutritive of all article. She says, "Just try and
    boil down a lb. of beef into beef tea; evaporate your beef tea,
    and see what is left of your beef: you will find that there is
    barely a teaspoonful of solid nourishment to 1/4 pint of water
    in beef tea. Nevertheless, there is a certain reparative quality
    in it,--we do not know what,--as there is in tea; but it maybe
    safely given in almost any inflammatory disease, and is as
    little to be depended upon with the healthy or convalescent,
    where much nourishment is required."

SAVOURY BEEF TEA.

(Soyer's Recipe.)

1859. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of solid beef, 1 oz. of butter, 1 clove, 2 button onions or 1/2 a
large one, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1 quart of water.

Mode.--Cut the beef into very small dice; put it into a stewpan with the butter, clove, onion,
and salt; stir the meat round over the fire for a few minutes, until it produces a thin gravy;
then add the water, and let it simmer gently from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, skimming off every particle
of fat. When done, strain it through a sieve, and put it by in a cool place until required.
The same, if wanted quite plain, is done by merely omitting the vegetables, salt, and clove;
the butter cannot be objectionable, as it is taken out in skimming. Sufficient.--Allow 1 lb.
of beef to make 1 pint of good beef tea.

Note.--The meat loft from beef tea may be boiled a little longer, and pounded, with spices,
&c., for potting. It makes a very nice breakfast dish.

    DR. CHRISTISON says that "every one will be struck with the
    readiness with which certain classes of patients will often take
    diluted meat juice, or beef tea repeatedly, when they refuse all
    other kinds of food." This is particularly remarkable in case of
    gastric fever, in which, he says, little or nothing else besides
    beef tea, or diluted meat juice, has been taken for weeks, or
    even months; and yet a pint of beef tea contains scarcely 1/4
    oz. of anything but water. The result is so striking, that he
    asks, "What is its mode of action? Not simple nutriment; 1/4 oz.
    of the most nutritive material cannot nearly replace the daily
    wear and tear of the tissue in any circumstances." Possibly, he
    says, it belongs to a new denomination of remedies.

BAKED BEEF TEA.

1860. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of fleshy beef, 1-1/2 pint of water, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt.

Mode.--Cut the beef into small square pieces, after trimming off all the fat, and put it into
a baking-jar, with the above proportion of water and salt; cover the jar well, place it in
a warm, but not hot oven, and bake for 3 or 4 hours. When the oven is very fierce in the daytime,
it is a good plan to put the jar in at night, and let it remain till the next morning, when
the tea will be done. It should be strained, and put by in a cool place until wanted. It may
also be flavoured with an onion, a clove, and a few sweet herbs, &c., when the stomach is sufficiently
strong to take those.

Time.--3 or 4 hours, or to be left in the oven all night.

BAKED OR STEWED CALF'S FOOT.

1861. INGREDIENTS.--1 calf's foot, 1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 blade of mace, the rind
of 1/4 lemon, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Well clean the foot, and either stew or bake it in the milk-and-water with the other
ingredients from 3 to 4 hours. To enhance the flavour, an onion and a small quantity of celery
may be added, if approved; 1/2 a teacupful of cream, stirred in just before serving, is also
a great improvement to this dish.

Time.--3 to 4 hours. Average cost, in full season, 9d. each.

Sufficient for 1 person. Seasonable from March to October.

CALF'S-FOOT BROTH.

1862. INGREDIENTS.--1 calf's foot, 3 pints of water, 1 small lump of sugar, nutmeg to taste,
the yolk of 1 egg, a piece of butter the size of a nut.

Mode.--Stew the foot in the water, with the lemon-peel, very gently, until the liquid is half
wasted, removing any scum, should it rise to the surface. Set it by in a basin until quite
cold, then take off every particle of fat. Warm up about 1/2 pint of the broth, adding the
butter, sugar, and a very small quantity of grated nutmeg; take it off the fire for a minute
or two, then add the beaten yolk of the egg; keep stirring over the fire until the mixture
thickens, but do not allow it to boil again after the egg is added, or it will curdle, and
the broth will be spoiled.

Time.--To be boiled until the liquid is reduced one half.

Average cost, in full season, 9d. each.

Sufficient to make 1-1/4 pint of broth.

Seasonable from March to October.

CHICKEN BROTH.

1863. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 fowl, or the inferior joints of a whole one; 1 quart of water, 1 blade
of mace, 1/2 onion, a small bunch of sweet herbs, salt to taste, 10 peppercorns.

Mode.--An old fowl not suitable for eating may be converted into very good broth, or, if a
young one be used, the inferior joints may be put in the broth, and the best pieces reserved
for dressing in some other manner. Put the fowl into a saucepan, with all the ingredients,
and simmer gently for 1-1/2 hour, carefully skimming the broth well. When done, strain, and
put by in a cool place until wanted; then take all the fat off the top, warm up as much as
may be required, and serve. This broth is, of course, only for those invalids whose stomachs
are strong enough to digest it, with a flavouring of herbs, &c. It may be made in the same
manner as beef tea, with water and salt only; but the preparation will be but tasteless and
insipid. When the invalid cannot digest this chicken broth with the flavouring, we would recommend
plain beef tea in preference to plain chicken tea, which it would be without the addition of
herbs, onions, &c.

Time.--1-1/2 hour.

Sufficient to make rather more than 1 pint of broth.

NUTRITIOUS COFFEE.

1864. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz. of ground coffee, 1 pint of milk.

Mode.--Let the coffee be freshly ground; put it into a saucepan, with the milk, which should
be made nearly boiling before the coffee is put in, and boil both together for 3 minutes; clear
it by pouring some of it into a cup, and then back again, and leave it on the hob for a few
minutes to settle thoroughly. This coffee may be made still more nutritious by the addition
of an egg well beaten, and put into the coffee-cup.

Time.--5 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to settle.

Sufficient to make 1 large breakfast-cupful of coffee.

    Our great nurse Miss Nightingale remarks, that "a great deal too
    much against tea is said by wise people, and a great deal too
    much of tea is given to the sick by foolish people. When you see
    the natural and almost universal craving in English sick for
    their 'tea,' you cannot but feel that Nature knows what she is
    about. But a little tea or coffee restores them quite as much as
    a great deal; and a great deal of tea, and especially of coffee,
    impairs the little power of digestion they have. Yet a nurse,
    because she sees how one or two cups of tea or coffee restore
    her patient, thinks that three or four cups will do twice as
    much. This is not the case at all; it is, however, certain that
    there is nothing yet discovered which is a substitute to the
    English patient for his cup of tea; he can take it when he can
    take nothing else, and he often can't take anything else, if he
    has it not. Coffee is a better restorative than tea, but a
    greater impairer of the digestion. In making coffee, it is
    absolutely necessary to buy it in the berry, and grind it at
    home; otherwise, you may reckon upon its containing a certain
    amount of chicory, at least. This is not a question of the
    taste, or of the wholesomeness of chicory; it is, that chicory
    has nothing at all of the properties for which you give coffee,
    and, therefore, you may as well not give it."

THE INVALID'S CUTLET.

1865. INGREDIENTS.--1 nice cutlet from a loin or neck of mutton, 2 teacupfuls of water, 1 very
small stick of celery, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Have the cutlet cut from a very nice loin or neck of mutton; take off all the fat; put
it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients; stew very gently indeed for nearly 2 hours,
and skim off every particle of fat that may rise to the surface from time to time. The celery
should be cut into thin slices before it is added to the meat, and care must be taken not to
put in too much of this ingredient, or the dish will not be good. If the water is allowed to
boil fast, the cutlet will be hard.

Time.--2 hours' very gentle stewing. Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient for 1 person. Seasonable at any time.

EEL BROTH.

1866. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of eels, a small bunch of sweet herbs, including parsley; 1/2 onion,
10 peppercorns, 3 pints of water, 2 cloves, salt and pepper to taste.

Mode.--After having cleaned and skinned the eel, cut it into small pieces, and put it into
a stewpan, with the other ingredients; simmer gently until the liquid is reduced nearly half,
carefully removing the scum as it rises. This is a very nutritious broth, and easy of digestion.

Time.--To be simmered until the liquor is reduced to half.

Average cost, 6d.

Sufficient to make 1-1/2 pint of broth.

Seasonable from June to March.

EGG WINE.

1867. INGREDIENTS.--1 egg, 1 tablespoonful and 1/2 glass of cold water, 1 glass of sherry,
sugar and grated nutmeg to taste.

Mode.--Beat the egg, mixing with it a tablespoonful of cold water; make the wine-and-water
hot, but not boiling; pour it on the egg, stirring all the time. Add sufficient lump sugar
to sweeten the mixture, and a little grated nutmeg; put all into a very clean saucepan, set
it on a gentle fire, and stir the contents one way until they thicken, but do not allow them
to boil. Serve in a glass with sippets of toasted bread or plain crisp biscuits. When the egg
is not warmed, the mixture will be found easier of digestion, but it is not so pleasant a drink.

Sufficient for 1 person.

TO MAKE GRUEL.

1868. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of Robinson's patent groats, 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,
1 pint of boiling water.

Mode.--Mix the prepared groats smoothly with the cold water in a basin; pour over them the
boiling water, stirring it all the time. Put it into a very clean saucepan; boil the gruel
for 10 minutes, keeping it well stirred; sweeten to taste, and serve. It may be flavoured with
a small piece of lemon-peel, by boiling it in the gruel, or a little grated nutmeg may be put
in; but in these matters the taste of the patient should be consulted. Pour the gruel in a
tumbler and serve. When wine is allowed to the invalid, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry or port
make this preparation very nice. In cases of colds, the same quantity of spirits is sometimes
added instead of wine.

Time.--10 minutes.

Sufficient to make a pint of gruel.

INVALID'S JELLY.

1869. INGREDIENTS.--12 shanks of mutton, 3 quarts of water, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper
and salt to taste, 3 blades of mace, 1 onion, 1 lb. of lean beef, a crust of bread toasted brown.

Mode.--Soak the shanks in plenty of water for some hours, and scrub them well; put them, with
the beef and other ingredients, into a saucepan with the water, and let them simmer very gently
for 5 hours. Strain the broth, and, when cold, take off all the fat. It may be eaten either
warmed up or cold as a jelly.

Time.--5 hours. Average cost, 1s.

Sufficient to make from 1-1/2 to 2 pints of jelly.

Seasonable at any time.

LEMONADE FOR INVALIDS.

1870. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lemon, lump sugar to taste, 1 pint of boiling water.

Mode.--Pare off the rind of the lemon thinly; cut the lemon into 2 or 3 thick slices, and remove
as much as possible of the white outside pith, and all the pips. Put the slices of lemon, the
peel, and lump sugar into a jug; pour over the boiling water; cover it closely, and in 2 hours
it will be fit to drink. It should either be strained or poured off from the sediment.

Time.--2 hours. Average cost, 2d.

Sufficient to make 1 pint of lemonade. Seasonable at any time.

NOURISHING LEMONADE.

1871. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of boiling water, the juice of 4 lemons, the rinds of 2, 1/2
pint of sherry, 4 eggs, 6 oz. of loaf sugar.

Mode.--Pare off the lemon-rind thinly, put it into a jug with the sugar, and pour over the
boiling water. Let it cool, then strain it; add the wine, lemon-juice, and eggs, previously
well beaten, and also strained, and the beverage will be ready for use. If thought desirable,
the quantity of sherry and water could be lessened, and milk substituted for them. To obtain
the flavour of the lemon-rind properly, a few lumps of the sugar should be rubbed over it,
until some of the yellow is absorbed.

Time.--Altogether 1 hour to make it. Average cost, 1s. 8d.

Sufficient to make 2-1/2 pints of lemonade. Seasonable at any time.

TO MAKE MUTTON BROTH.

1872. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of the scrag end of the neck of mutton, 1 onion, a bunch of sweet
herbs, 4 turnip, 1/2 pints of water, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Put the mutton into a stewpan; pour over the water cold and add the other ingredients.
When it boils, skim it very carefully, cover the pan closely, and let it simmer very gently
for an hour; strain it, let it cool, take off all the fat from the surface, and warm up as
much as may be required, adding, if the patient be allowed to take it, a teaspoonful of minced
parsley which has been previously scalded. Pearl barley or rice are very nice additions to
mutton broth, and should be boiled as long as the other ingredients. When either of these is
added, the broth must not be strained, but merely thoroughly skimmed. Plain mutton broth without
seasoning is made by merely boiling the mutton, water, and salt together, straining it, letting
the broth cool, skimming all the fat off, and warming up as much as is required. This preparation
would be very tasteless and insipid, but likely to agree with very delicate stomachs, whereas
the least addition of other ingredients would have the contrary effect.

Time.--1 hour. Average cost, 7d.

Sufficient to make from 1-1/2 to 2 pints of broth.

Seasonable at any time.

Note.--Veal broth may be made in the same manner; the knuckle of a leg or shoulder is the part
usually used for this purpose. It is very good with the addition of the inferior joints of
a fowl, or a few shank-bones.

MUTTON BROTH, QUICKLY MADE.

1873. INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 chops from a neck of mutton, 1 pint of water, a small bunch of sweet
herbs, 1/4 of an onion, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Cut the meat into small pieces, put it into a saucepan with the bones, but no skin or
fat; add the other ingredients; cover the saucepan, and bring the water quickly to boil. Take
the lid off, and continue the rapid boiling for 20 minutes, skimming it well during the process;
strain the broth into a basin; if there should be any fat left on the surface, remove it by
laying a piece of thin paper on the top: the greasy particles will adhere to the paper, and
so free the preparation from them. To an invalid nothing is more disagreeable than broth served
with a quantity of fat floating on the top; to avoid this, it is always better to allow it
to get thoroughly cool, the fat can then be so easily removed.

Time.--20 minutes after the water boils. Average cost, 5d.

Sufficient to make 1/2 pint of broth. Seasonable at any time.

STEWED RABBITS IN MILK.

1874. INGREDIENTS.--2 very young rabbits, not nearly half grown; 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1 blade
of mace, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, a little salt and cayenne.

Mode.--Mix the flour very smoothly with 4 tablespoonfuls of the milk, and when this is well
mixed, add the remainder. Cut up the rabbits into joints, put them into a stewpan, with the
milk and other ingredients, and simmer them very gently until quite tender. Stir the contents
from time to time, to keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning. 1/2 hour will be sufficient
for the cooking of this dish. Seasonable from September to February.

RICE-MILK.

1875. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of rice, 1 quart of milk, sugar to taste; when liked,
a little grated nutmeg.

Mode.--Well wash the rice, put it into a saucepan with the milk, and simmer gently until the
rice is tender, stirring it from time to time to prevent the milk from burning; sweeten it,
add a little grated nutmeg, and serve. This dish is also very suitable and wholesome for children;
it may be flavoured with a little lemon-peel, and a little finely-minced suet may be boiled
with it, which renders it more strengthening and more wholesome. Tapioca, semolina, vermicelli,
and macaroni, may all be dressed in the same manner.

Time.--From 3/4 to 1 hour. Seasonable at any time.

TO MAKE TOAST-AND-WATER.

1876. INGREDIENTS.--A slice of bread, 1 quart of boiling water.

Mode.--Cut a slice from a stale loaf (a piece of hard crust is better than anything else for
the purpose), toast it of a nice brown on every side, but do not allow it to burn or blacken.
Put it into a jug, pour the boiling water over it, cover it closely, and let it remain until
cold. When strained, it will be ready for use. Toast-and-water should always be made a short
time before it is required, to enable it to get cold: if drunk in a tepid or lukewarm state,
it is an exceedingly disagreeable beverage. If, as is sometimes the case, this drink is wanted
in a hurry, put the toasted bread into a jug, and only just cover it with the boiling water;
when this is cool, cold water may be added in the proportion required,--the toast-and-water
strained; it will then be ready for use, and is more expeditiously prepared than by the above
method.

TOAST SANDWICHES.

1877. INGREDIENTS.--Thin cold toast, thin slices of bread-and-butter, pepper and salt to taste.

Mode.--Place a very thin piece of cold toast between 2 slices of thin bread-and-butter in the
form of a sandwich, adding a seasoning of pepper and salt. This sandwich may be varied by adding
a little pulled meat, or very fine slices of cold meat, to the toast, and in any of these forms
will be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid.

1878. Besides the recipes contained in this chapter, there are, in the previous chapters on
cookery, many others suitable for invalids, which it would be useless to repeat here. Recipes
for fish simply dressed, light soups, plain roast meat, well-dressed vegetables, poultry, simple
puddings, jelly, stewed fruits, &c. &c., all of which dishes may be partaken of by invalids
and convalescents, will be found in preceding chapters.

DINNERS AND DINING.

CHAPTER XL.

1879. Man, it has been said, is a dining animal. Creatures of the inferior races eat and drink;
man only dines. It has also been said that he is a cooking animal; but some races eat food
without cooking it. Huntsmen in Dauphiny, when out shooting, have been known to kill a bird,
pluck it, salt and pepper it, and cook it by carrying it some time in their caps. It is equally
true that some races of men do not dine any more than the tiger or the vulture. It is not a
dinner at which sits the aboriginal Australian, who gnaws his bone half bare and then flings
it behind to his squaw. And the native of Terra-del-Fuego does not dine when he gets his morsel
of red clay. Dining is the privilege of civilization. The rank which a people occupy in the
grand scale may be measured by their way of taking their meals, as well as by their way of
treating their women. The nation which knows how to dine has learnt the leading lesson of progress.
It implies both the will and the skill to reduce to order, and surround with idealisms and
graces, the more material conditions of human existence; and wherever that will and that skill
exist, life cannot be wholly ignoble.

1880. Dinner, being the grand solid meal of the day, is a matter of considerable importance;
and a well-served table is a striking index of human, ingenuity and resource. "Their table,"
says Lord Byron, in describing a dinner-party given by Lord and Lady Amundevillo at Norman Abbey,--

  "Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
  To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
  I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,
  Albeit all human history attests
  That happiness for man--the hungry sinner!--
  Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner."

And then he goes on to observe upon the curious complexity of the results produced by human
cleverness and application catering for the modifications which occur in civilized life, one
of the simplest of the primal instincts:--

  "The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
  Of intellect expended on two courses;
  And indigestion's grand multiplication
  Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.
  Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
  That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,
  As form a science and a nomenclature
  From out the commonest demands of nature?"

And we may well say, Who, indeed, would suppose it? The gulf between the Croat, with a steak
under his saddle, and Alexis Soyer getting up a great dinner at the Reform-Club, or even Thackeray's
Mrs. Raymond Gray giving "a little dinner" to Mr. Snob (with one of those famous "roly-poly
puddings" of hers),--what a gulf it is!

1881. That Adam's "ration," however, was "simple," is a matter on which we have contrary judgments
given by the poets. When Raphael paid that memorable visit to Paradise,--which we are expressly
told by Milton he did exactly at dinner-time,--Eve seems to have prepared "a little dinner"
not wholly destitute of complexity, and to have added ice-creams and perfumes. Nothing can
be clearer than the testimony of the poet on these points:--

  "And Eve within, due at her home prepared
  For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please
  True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
  Of nectarous draughts between....
  .... With dispatchful looks in haste
  She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent,
  What choice to choose for delicacy best,
  What order so contrived as not to mix
  Tastes not well join'd, inelegant, but bring
  Taste after taste, upheld with kindliest change--
         *       *       *       *       *
  "She tempers dulcet creams....
  .... then strews the ground
  With rose and odours."

It may be observed, in passing, that the poets, though they have more to say about wine than
solid food, because the former more directly stimulates the intellect and the feelings, do
not flinch from the subject of eating and drinking. There is infinite zest in the above passage
from Milton, and even more in the famous description of a dainty supper, given by Keats in
his "Eve of Saint Agnes." Could Queen Mab herself desire to sit down to anything nicer, both
as to its appointments and serving, and as to its quality, than the collation served by Porphyro
in the lady's bedroom while she slept?--

  "There by the bedside, where the faded moon
  Made a dim silver twilight, soft he set
  A table, and, half-anguish'd, threw thereor
  A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet.
        *       *       *       *       *
  "While he, from forth the closet, brought a heap
  Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;
  With jellies smoother than the creamy curd,
  And lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon;
  Manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd
  From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,
  From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon."

But Tennyson has ventured beyond dates, and quinces, and syrups, which may be thought easy
to be brought in by a poet. In his idyl of "Audley Court" he gives a most appetizing description
of a pasty at a pic-nic:--

  "There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid
  A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound;
  Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,
  And, half cut down, a pasty costly made,
  Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret, lay
  Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks
  Imbedded and injellied."

We gladly quote passages like these, to show how eating and drinking may be surrounded with
poetical associations, and how man, using his privilege to turn any and every repast into a
"feast of reason," with a warm and plentiful "flow of soul," may really count it as not the
least of his legitimate prides, that he is "a dining animal."

1882. It has been said, indeed, that great men, in general, are great diners. This, however,
can scarcely be true of any great men but men of action; and, in that case, it would simply
imply that persons of vigorous constitution, who work hard, eat heartily; for, of course, a
life of action requires a vigorous constitution, even though there may be much illness, as
in such cases as William III. and our brave General Napier. Of men of thought, it can scarcely
be true that they eat so much, in a general way, though even they eat more than they are apt
to suppose they do; for, as Mr. Lewes observes, "nerve-tissue is very expensive." Leaving great
men of all kinds, however, to get their own dinners, let us, who are not great, look after
ours. Dine we must, and we may as well dine elegantly as well as wholesomely.

1883. There are plenty of elegant dinners in modern days, and they were not wanting in ancient
times. It is well known that the dinner-party, or symposium, was a not unimportant, and not
unpoetical, feature in the life of the sociable, talkative, tasteful Greek. Douglas Jerrold
said that such is the British humour for dining and giving of dinners, that if London were
to be destroyed by an earthquake, the Londoners would meet at a public dinner to consider the
subject. The Greeks, too, were great diners: their social and religious polity gave them many
chances of being merry and making others merry on good eating and drinking. Any public or even
domestic sacrifice to one of the gods, was sure to be followed by a dinner-party, the remains
of the slaughtered "offering" being served up on the occasion as a pious pièce de résistance;
and as the different gods, goddesses, and demigods, worshipped by the community in general,
or by individuals, were very numerous indeed, and some very religious people never let a day
pass without offering up something or other, the dinner-parties were countless. A birthday,
too, was an excuse for a dinner; a birthday, that is, of any person long dead and buried, as
well as of a living person, being a member of the family, or otherwise esteemed. Dinners were,
of course, eaten on all occasions of public rejoicing. Then, among the young people, subscription
dinners, very much after the manner of modern times, were always being got up; only that they
would be eaten not at an hotel, but probably at the house of one of the heterae. A Greek dinner-party
was a handsome, well-regulated affair. The guests came in elegantly dressed and crowned with
flowers. A slave, approaching each person as he entered, took off his sandals and washed his
feet. During the repast, the guests reclined on couches with pillows, among and along which
were set small tables. After the solid meal came the "symposium" proper, a scene of music,
merriment, and dancing, the two latter being supplied chiefly by young girls. There was a chairman,
or symposiarch, appointed by the company to regulate the drinking; and it was his duty to mix
the wine in the "mighty bowl." From this bowl the attendants ladled the liquor into goblets,
and, with the goblets, went round and round the tables, filling the cups of the guests.

1884. The elegance with which a dinner is served is a matter which depends, of course, partly
upon the means, but still more upon the taste of the master and mistress of the house. It may
be observed, in general, that there should always be flowers on the table, and as they form
no item of expense, there is no reason why they should not be employed every day.

1885. The variety in the dishes which furnish forth a modern dinner-table, does not necessarily
imply anything unwholesome, or anything capricious. Food that is not well relished cannot be
well digested; and the appetite of the over-worked man of business, or statesman, or of any
dweller in towns, whose occupations are exciting and exhausting, is jaded, and requires stimulation.
Men and women who are in rude health, and who have plenty of air and exercise, eat the simplest
food with relish, and consequently digest it well; but those conditions are out of the reach
of many men. They must suit their mode of dining to their mode of living, if they cannot choose
the latter. It is in serving up food that is at once appetizing and wholesome that the skill
of the modern housewife is severely tasked; and she has scarcely a more important duty to fulfil.
It is, in fact, her particular vocation, in virtue of which she may be said to hold the health
of the family, and of the friends of the family, in her hands from day to day. It has been
said that "the destiny of nations depends on the manner in which they are fed;" and a great
gastronomist exclaims, "Tell me what kind of food you eat, and I will tell you what kind of
man you are." The same writer has some sentences of the same kind, which are rather hyperbolical,
but worth quoting:--"The pleasures of the table belong to all ages, to all conditions, to all
countries, and to all eras; they mingle with all other pleasures, and remain, at last, to console
us for their departure. The discovery of a new dish confers more happiness upon humanity than
the discovery of a new star."

1886. The gastronomist from whom we have already quoted, has some aphorisms and short directions
in relation to dinner-parties, which are well deserving of notice:--"Let the number of your
guests never exceed twelve, so that the conversation may be general. [Footnote: We have seen
this varied by saying that the number should never exceed that of the Muses or fall below that
of the Graces.] Let the temperature of the dining-room be about 68°. Let the dishes be few
in number in the first course, but proportionally good. The order of food is from the most
substantial to the lightest. The order of drinking wine is from the mildest to the most foamy
and most perfumed. To invite a person to your house is to take charge of his happiness so long
as he is beneath your roof. The mistress of the house should always be certain that the coffee
be excellent; whilst the master should be answerable for the quality of his wines and liqueurs."

Note.--Dinners à la Russe differ from ordinary dinners in the mode of serving the various dishes.
In a dinner à la Russe, the dishes are cut up on a sideboard, and handed round to the guests,
and each dish may be considered a course. The table for a dinner à la Russe should be laid
with flowers and plants in fancy flowerpots down the middle, together with some of the dessert
dishes. A menu or bill of fare should be laid by the side of each guest.

  DESSERT AND ICES.

Note.--Dinners à la Russe are scarcely suitable for small establishments; a large number of
servants being required to carve; and to help the guests; besides there being a necessity for
more plates, dishes, knives, forks, and spoons, than are usually to be found in any other than
a very large establishment. Where, however, a service à la Russe is practicable, there it,
perhaps, no mode of serving a dinner so enjoyable as this.

SUPPERS.

2139. Much may be done in the arrangement of a supper-table, at a very small expense, provided
taste and ingenuity are exercised. The colours and flavours of the various dishes should contrast
nicely; there should be plenty of fruit and flowers on the table, and the room should be well
lighted. We have endeavoured to show how the various dishes may be placed; but of course these
little matters entirely depend on the length and width of the table used, on individual taste,
whether the tables are arranged round the room, whether down the centre, with a cross one at
the top, or whether the supper is laid in two separate rooms, &c. &c. The garnishing of the
dishes has also much to do with the appearance of a supper-table. Hams and tongues should be
ornamented with cut vegetable flowers, raised pies with aspic jelly cut in dice, and all the
dishes garnished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking absurd. The eye, in fact,
should be as much gratified as the palate. Hot soup is now often served at suppers, but is
not placed on the table. The servants fill the plates from a tureen on the buffet, and then
hand them to the guests: when these plates are removed, the business of supper commences.

2140. Where small rooms and large parties necessitate having a standing supper, many things
enumerated in the following bill of fare may be placed on the buffet. Dishes for these suppers
should be selected which may be eaten standing without any trouble. The following list may,
perhaps, assist our readers in the arrangement of a buffet for a standing supper.

2141. Beef, ham, and tongue sandwiches, lobster and oyster patties, sausage rolls, meat rolls,
lobster salad, dishes of fowls, the latter all cut up; dishes of sliced ham, sliced tongue,
sliced beef, and galantine of veal; various jellies, blancmanges, and creams; custards in glasses,
compôtes of fruit, tartlets of jam, and several dishes of small fancy pastry; dishes of fresh
fruit, bonbons, sweetmeats, two or three sponge cakes, a few plates of biscuits, and the buffet
ornamented with vases of fresh or artificial flowers. The above dishes are quite sufficient
for a standing supper; where more are desired, a supper must then be laid and arranged in the
usual manner.

Note.--The length of the page will not admit of our giving the dishes as they should be placed
on the table; they should be arranged with the large and high dishes down the centre, and the
spaces filled up with the smaller dishes, fruit, and flowers, taking care that the flavours
and colours contrast nicely, and that no two dishes of a sort come together. This bill of fare
may be made to answer three or four purposes, placing a wedding cake or christening cake in
the centre on a high stand, if required for either of these occasions. A few dishes of fowls,
lobster salads, &c. &c., should be kept in reserve to replenish those that are most likely
to be eaten first. A joint of cold roast and boiled beef should be placed on the buffet, as
being something substantial for the gentlemen of the party to partake of. Besides the articles
enumerated in the bill of fare, biscuits and wafers will be required, cream-and-water ices,
tea, coffee, wines, liqueurs, soda-water, ginger-beer, and lemonade.

BREAKFASTS.

2144. It will not be necessary to give here a long bill of fare of cold joints, &c., which
may be placed on the side-board, and do duty at the breakfast-table. Suffice it to say, that
any cold meat the larder may furnish, should be nicely garnished, and be placed on the buffet.
Collared and potted meats or fish, cold game or poultry, veal-and-ham pies, game-and-Rump-steak
pies, are all suitable dishes for the breakfast-table; as also cold ham, tongue, &c. &c.

2145. The following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in knowing what to provide
for the comfortable meal called breakfast. Broiled fish, such as mackerel, whiting, herrings,
dried haddocks, &c.; mutton chops and rump-steaks, broiled sheep's kidneys, kidneys à la maître
d'hôtel, sausages, plain rashers of bacon, bacon and poached eggs, ham and poached eggs, omelets,
plain boiled eggs, oeufs-au-plat, poached eggs on toast, muffins, toast, marmalade, butter, &c. &c.

2146. In the summer, and when they are obtainable, always have a vase of freshly-gathered flowers
on the breakfast-table, and, when convenient, a nicely-arranged dish of fruit: when strawberries
are in season, these are particularly refreshing; as also grapes, or even currants.

LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS.

2147. The remains of cold joints, nicely garnished, a few sweets, or a little hashed meat,
poultry or game, are the usual articles placed on the table for luncheon, with bread and cheese,
biscuits, butter, &c. If a substantial meal is desired, rump-steaks or mutton chops may he
served, as also veal cutlets, kidneys, or any dish of that kind. In families where there is
a nursery, the mistress of the house often partakes of the meal with the children, and makes
it her luncheon. In the summer, a few dishes of fresh fruit should be added to the luncheon,
or, instead of this, a compote of fruit or fruit tart, or pudding.

2148. Of suppers we have little to say, as we have already given two bills of fare for a large
party, which will answer very well for a smaller number, by reducing the quantity of dishes
and by omitting a few. Hot suppers are now very little in request, as people now generally
dine at an hour which precludes the possibility of requiring supper; at all events, not one
of a substantial kind. Should, however, a bill of fare be required, one of those under the
head of DINNERS, with slight alterations, will be found to answer for a hot supper.

BILL OF FARE FOR A PICNIC FOR 40 PERSONS.

2149. A joint of cold roast beef, a joint of cold boiled beef, 2 ribs of lamb, 2 shoulders
of lamb, 4 roast fowls, 2 roast ducks, 1 ham, 1 tongue, 2 veal-and-ham pies, 2 pigeon pies,
6 medium-sized lobsters, 1 piece of collared calf's head, 18 lettuces, 6 baskets of salad,
6 cucumbers.

2150. Stewed fruit well sweetened, and put into glass bottles well corked; 3 or 4 dozen plain
pastry biscuits to eat with the stewed fruit, 2 dozen fruit turnovers, 4 dozen cheesecakes,
2 cold cabinet puddings in moulds, 2 blancmanges in moulds, a few jam puffs, 1 large cold plum-pudding
(this must be good), a few baskets of fresh fruit, 3 dozen plain biscuits, a piece of cheese,
6 lbs. of butter (this, of course, includes the butter for tea), 4 quartern loaves of household
broad, 3 dozen rolls, 6 loaves of tin bread (for tea), 2 plain plum cakes, 2 pound cakes, 2
sponge cakes, a tin of mixed biscuits, 1/2 lb, of tea. Coffee is not suitable for a picnic,
being difficult to make.

Things not to be forgotten at a Picnic.

2151. A stick of horseradish, a bottle of mint-sauce well corked, a bottle of salad dressing,
a bottle of vinegar, made mustard, pepper, salt, good oil, and pounded sugar. If it can be
managed, take a little ice. It is scarcely necessary to say that plates, tumblers, wine-glasses,
knives, forks, and spoons, must not be forgotten; as also teacups and saucers, 3 or 4 teapots,
some lump sugar, and milk, if this last-named article cannot be obtained in the neighbourhood.
Take 3 corkscrews.

2152. Beverages.--3 dozen quart bottles of ale, packed in hampers; ginger-beer, soda-water,
and lemonade, of each 2 dozen bottles; 6 bottles of sherry, 6 bottles of claret, champagne
à discrétion, and any other light wine that may be preferred, and 2 bottles of brandy. Water
can usually be obtained so it is useless to take it.

DOMESTIC SERVANTS.

CHAPTER XLI.

2153. It is the custom of "Society" to abuse its servants,--a façon de parler, such as leads
their lords and masters to talk of the weather, and, when rurally inclined, of the crops,--leads
matronly ladies, and ladies just entering on their probation in that honoured and honourable
state, to talk of servants, and, as we are told, wax eloquent over the greatest plague in life
while taking a quiet cup of tea. Young men at their clubs, also, we are told, like to abuse
their "fellows," perhaps not without a certain pride and pleasure at the opportunity of intimating
that they enjoy such appendages to their state. It is another conviction of "Society" that
the race of good servants has died out, at least in England, although they do order these things
better in France; that there is neither honesty, conscientiousness, nor the careful and industrious
habits which distinguished the servants of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers; that domestics
no longer know their place; that the introduction of cheap silks and cottons, and, still more
recently, those ambiguous "materials" and tweeds, have removed the landmarks between the mistress
and her maid, between the master and his man.

2154. When the distinction really depends on things so insignificant, this is very probably
the case; when the lady of fashion chooses her footman without any other consideration than
his height, shape, and tournure of his calf, it is not surprising that she should find a domestic
who has no attachment for the family, who considers the figure he cuts behind her carriage,
and the late hours he is compelled to keep, a full compensation for the wages he exacts, for
the food he wastes, and for the perquisites he can lay his hands on. Nor should the fast young
man, who chooses his groom for his knowingness in the ways of the turf and in the tricks of
low horse-dealers, be surprised if he is sometimes the victim of these learned ways. But these
are the exceptional cases, which prove the existence of a better state of things. The great
masses of society among us are not thus deserted; there are few families of respectability,
from the shopkeeper in the next street to the nobleman whose mansion dignifies the next square,
which do not contain among their dependents attached and useful servants; and where these are
absent altogether, there are good reasons for it. The sensible master and the kind mistress
know, that if servants depend on them for their means of living, in their turn they are dependent
on their servants for very many of the comforts of life; and that, with a proper amount of
care in choosing servants, and treating them like reasonable beings, and making slight excuses
for the shortcomings of human nature, they will, save in some exceptional case, be tolerably
well served, and, in most instances, surround themselves with attached domestics.

2155. This remark, which is applicable to all domestics, is especially so to men-servants.
Families accustomed to such attendants have always about them humble dependents, whose children
have no other prospect than domestic service to look forward to; to them it presents no degradation,
but the reverse, to be so employed; they are initiated step by step into the mysteries of the
household, with the prospect of rising in the service, if it is a house admitting of promotion,--to
the respectable position of butler or house-steward. In families of humbler pretensions, where
they must look for promotion elsewhere, they know that can only be attained by acquiring the
goodwill of their employers. Can there be any stronger security for their good conduct,--any
doubt that, in the mass of domestic servants, good conduct is the rule, the reverse the exception?

2156. The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position
of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head
of which is the chamberlain and house-steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where
a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer. The majority
of gentlemen's establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman,
and coachman, or coachman and groom, where the horses exceed two or three.

DUTIES OF THE BUTLER.

2157. The domestic duties of the butler are to bring in the eatables at breakfast, and wait
upon the family at that meal, assisted by the footman, and see to the cleanliness of everything
at table. On taking away, he removes the tray with the china and plate, for which he is responsible.
At luncheon, he arranges the meal, and waits unassisted, the footman being now engaged in other
duties. At dinner, he places the silver and plated articles on the table, sees that everything
is in its place, and rectifies what is wrong. He carries in the first dish, and announces in
the drawing-room that dinner is on the table, and respectfully stands by the door until the
company are seated, when he takes his place behind his master's chair on the left, to remove
the covers, handing them to the other attendants to carry out. After the first course of plates
is supplied, his place is at the sideboard to serve the wines, but only when called on.

2158. The first course ended, he rings the cook's bell, and hands the dishes from the table
to the other servants to carry away, receiving from them the second course, which he places
on the table, removing the covers as before, and again taking his place at the sideboard.

2159. At dessert, the slips being removed, the butler receives the dessert from the other servants,
and arranges it on the table, with plates and glasses, and then takes his place behind his
master's chair to hand the wines and ices, while the footman stands behind his mistress for
the same purpose, the other attendants leaving the room. Where the old-fashioned practice of
having the dessert on the polished table, without any cloth, is still adhered to, the butler
should rub off any marks made by the hot dishes before arranging the dessert.

2160. Before dinner, he has satisfied himself that the lamps, candles, or gas-burners are in
perfect order, if not lighted, which will usually be the case. Having served every one with
their share of the dessert, put the fires in order (when these are used), and seen the lights
are all right, at a signal from his master, he and the footman leave the room.

2161. He now proceeds to the drawing-room, arranges the fireplace, and sees to the lights;
he then returns to his pantry, prepared to answer the bell, and attend to the company, while
the footman is clearing away and cleaning the plate and glasses.

2162. At tea he again attends. At bedtime he appears with the candles; he locks up the plate,
secures doors and windows, and sees that all the fires are safe.

2163. In addition to these duties, the butler, where only one footman is kept, will be required
to perform some of the duties of the valet, to pay bills, and superintend the other servants.
But the real duties of the butler are in the wine-cellar; there he should be competent to advise
his master as to the price and quality of the wine to be laid in; "fine," bottle, cork, and
seal it, and place it in the binns. Brewing, racking, and bottling malt liquors, belong to
his office, as well as their distribution. These and other drinkables are brought from the
cellar every day by his own hands, except where an under-butler is kept; and a careful entry
of every bottle used, entered in the cellar-book; so that the book should always show the contents
of the cellar.

    2164. The office of butler is thus one of very great trust in a
    household. Here, as elsewhere, honesty is the best policy: the
    butler should make it his business to understand the proper
    treatment of the different wines under his charge, which he can
    easily do from the wine-merchant, and faithfully attend to it;
    his own reputation will soon compensate for the absence of
    bribes from unprincipled wine-merchants, if he serves a generous
    and hospitable master. Nothing spreads more rapidly in society
    than the reputation of a good wine-cellar, and all that is
    required is wines well chosen and well cared for; and this a
    little knowledge, carefully applied, will soon supply.

2165. The butler, we have said, has charge of the contents of the cellars, and it is his duty
to keep them in a proper condition, to fine down wine in wood, bottle it off, and store it
away in places suited to the sorts. Where wine comes into the cellar ready bottled, it is usual
to return the same number of empty bottles; the butler has not, in this case, the same inducements
to keep the bottles of the different sorts separated; but where the wine is bottled in the
house, he will find his account, not only in keeping them separate, but in rinsing them well,
and even washing them with clean water as soon as they are empty.

    2166. There are various modes of fining wine: isinglass,
    gelatine, and gum Arabic are all used for the purpose. Whichever
    of these articles is used, the process is always the same.
    Supposing eggs (the cheapest) to be used,--Draw a gallon or so
    of the wine, and mix one quart of it with the whites of four
    eggs, by stirring it with a whisk; afterwards, when thoroughly
    mixed, pour it back into the cask through the bunghole, and stir
    up the whole cask, in a rotatory direction, with a clean split
    stick inserted through the bunghole. Having stirred it
    sufficiently, pour in the remainder of the wine drawn off, until
    the cask is full; then stir again, skimming off the bubbles that
    rise to the surface. When thoroughly mixed by stirring, close
    the bunghole, and leave it to stand for three or four days. This
    quantity of clarified wine will fine thirteen dozen of port or
    sherry. The other clearing ingredients are applied in the same
    manner, the material being cut into small pieces, and dissolved
    in the quart of wine, and the cask stirred in the same manner.

    2167. To Bottle Wine.--Having thoroughly washed and dried the
    bottles, supposing they have been before used for the same kind
    of wine, provide corks, which will be improved by being slightly
    boiled, or at least steeped in hot water,--a wooden hammer or
    mallet, a bottling-boot, and a squeezer for the corks. Bore a
    hole in the lower part of the cask with a gimlet, receiving the
    liquid stream which follows in the bottle and filterer, which is
    placed in a tub or basin. This operation is best performed by
    two persons, one to draw the wine, the other to cork the
    bottles. The drawer is to see that the bottles are up to the
    mark, but not too full, the bottle being placed in a clean tub
    to prevent waste. The corking-boot is buckled by a strap to the
    knee, the bottle placed in it, and the cork, after being
    squeezed in the press, driven in by a flat wooden mallet.

    2168. As the wine draws near to the bottom of the cask, a thick
    piece of muslin is placed in the strainer, to prevent the
    viscous grounds from passing into the bottle.

    2169. Having carefully counted the bottles, they are stored away
    in their respective binns, a layer of sand or sawdust being
    placed under the first tier, and another over it; a second tier
    is laid over this, protected by a lath, the head of the second
    being laid to the bottom of the first; over this another bed of
    sawdust is laid, not too thick, another lath; and so on till the
    binn is filled.

    2170. Wine so laid in will be ready for use according to its
    quality and age. Port wine, old in the wood, will be ready to
    drink in five or six months; but if it is a fruity wine, it will
    improve every year. Sherry, if of good quality, will be fit to
    drink as soon as the "sickness" (as its first condition after
    bottling is called) ceases, and will also improve; but the
    cellar must be kept at a perfectly steady temperature, neither
    too hot nor too cold, but about 55° or 60°, and absolutely free
    from draughts of cold air.

DUTIES OF THE FOOTMAN.

2171. Where a single footman, or odd man, is the only male servant, then, whatever his ostensible
position, he is required to make himself generally useful. He has to clean the knives and shoes,
the furniture, the plate; answer the visitors who call, the drawing-room and parlour bells;
and do all the errands. His life is no sinecure; and a methodical arrangement of his time will
be necessary, in order to perform his many duties with any satisfaction to himself or his master.

    2172. The footman only finds himself in stockings, shoes, and
    washing. Where silk stockings, or other extra articles of linen
    are worn, they are found by the family, as well as his livery, a
    working dress, consisting of a pair of overalls, a waistcoat, a
    fustian jacket, with a white or jean one for times when he is
    liable to be called to answer the door or wait at breakfast;
    and, on quitting his service, he is expected to leave behind him
    any livery had within six months.

2173. The footman is expected to rise early, in order to get through all his dirty work before
the family are stirring. Boots and shoes, and knives and forks, should be cleaned, lamps in
use trimmed, his master's clothes brushed, the furniture rubbed over; so that he may put aside
his working dress, tidy himself, and appear in a clean jean jacket to lay the cloth and prepare
breakfast for the family.

    2174. We need hardly dwell on the boot-cleaning process: three
    good brushes and good blacking must be provided; one of the
    brushes hard, to brush off the mud; the other soft, to lay on
    the blacking; the third of a medium hardness, for polishing; and
    each should be kept for its particular use. The blacking should
    be kept corked up, except when in use, and applied to the brush
    with a sponge tied to a stick, which, when put away, rests in a
    notch cut in the cork. When boots come in very muddy, it is a
    good practice to wash off the mud, and wipe them dry with a
    sponge; then leave them to dry very gradually on their sides,
    taking care they are not placed near the fire, or scorched. Much
    delicacy of treatment is required in cleaning ladies' boots, so
    as to make the leather look well-polished, and the upper part
    retain a fresh appearance, with the lining free from hand-marks,
    which are very offensive to a lady of refined tastes.

    2175. Patent leather boots require to be wiped with a wet
    sponge, and afterwards with a soft dry cloth, and occasionally
    with a soft cloth and sweet oil, blacking and polishing the edge
    of the soles in the usual way, but so as not to cover the patent
    polish with blacking. A little milk may also be used with very
    good effect for patent leather boots.

    2176. Top boots are still occasionally worn by gentlemen. While
    cleaning the lower part in the usual manner, protect the tops,
    by inserting a cloth or brown paper under the edges and bringing
    it over them. In cleaning the tops, let the covering fall down
    over the boot; wash the tops clean with soap and flannel, and
    rub out any spots with pumice-stone. If the tops are to be
    whiter, dissolve an ounce of oxalic acid and half an ounce of
    pumice-stone in a pint of soft water; if a brown colour is
    intended, mix an ounce of muriatic acid, half an ounce of alum,
    half an ounce of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of spirit of
    lavender, in a pint and a half of skimmed milk "turned." These
    mixtures apply by means of a sponge, and polish, when dry, with
    a rubber made of soft flannel.

    2177. Knives are now generally cleaned by means of Kent's or
    Masters's machine, which gives very little trouble, and is very
    effective; before, however, putting the knives into the machine,
    it is highly necessary that they be first washed in a little
    warm (not hot) water, and then thoroughly wiped: if put into the
    machine with any grease on them, it adheres to the brushes, and
    consequently renders them unfit to use for the next knives that
    may be put in. When this precaution is not taken, the machine
    must come to pieces, so causing an immense amount of trouble,
    which may all be avoided by having the knives thoroughly free
    from grease before using the machine. Brushes are also used for
    cleaning forks, which facilitate the operation. When knives are
    so cleaned, see that they are carefully polished, wiped, and
    with a good edge, the ferules and prongs free from dirt, and
    place them in the basket with the handles all one way.

    2178. Lamp-trimming requires a thorough acquaintance with the
    mechanism; after that, constant attention to cleanliness, and an
    occasional entire clearing out with hot water: when this is
    done, all the parts should be carefully dried before filling
    again with oil. When lacquered, wipe the lacquered parts with a
    soft brush and cloth, and wash occasionally with weak soapsuds,
    wiping carefully afterwards. Brass lamps may be cleaned with oil
    and rottenstone every day when trimmed. With bronze, and other
    ornamental lamps, more care will be required, and soft flannel
    and oil only used, to prevent the removal of the bronze or
    enamel. Brass-work, or any metal-work not lacquered, is cleaned
    by a little oil and rottenstone made into a paste, or with fine
    emery-powder and oil mixed in the same manner. A small portion
    of sal ammoniac, beat into a fine powder and moistened with soft
    water, rubbed over brass ornaments, and heated over a charcoal
    fire, and rubbed dry with bran or whitening, will give to
    brass-work the brilliancy of gold. In trimming moderator lamps,
    let the wick be cut evenly all round; as, if left higher in one
    place than it is in another, it will cause it to smoke and burn
    badly. The lamp should then be filled with oil from a feeder,
    and afterwards well wiped with a cloth or rag kept for the
    purpose. If it can be avoided, never wash the chimneys of a
    lamp, as it causes them to crack when they become hot. Small
    sticks, covered with wash-leather pads, are the best things to
    use for cleaning the glasses inside, and a clean duster for
    polishing the outside. The globe of a moderator lamp should be
    occasionally washed in warm soap-and-water, then well rinsed in
    cold water, and either wiped dry or left to drain. Where
    candle-lamps are used, take out the springs occasionally, and
    free them well from the grease that adheres to them.

    2179. French polish, so universally applied to furniture, is
    easily kept in condition by dusting and rubbing with a soft
    cloth, or a rubber of old silk; but dining-tables can only be
    kept in order by hard rubbing, or rather by quick rubbing, which
    warms the wood and removes all spots.

    2180. Brushing clothes is a very simple but very necessary
    operation. Fine cloths require to be brushed lightly, and with
    rather a soft brush, except where mud is to be removed, when a
    hard one is necessary, being previously beaten lightly to
    dislodge the dirt. Lay the garment on a table, and brush it in
    the direction of the nap. Having brushed it properly, turn the
    sleeves back to the collar, so that the folds may come at the
    elbow-joints; next turn the lappels or sides back over the
    folded sleeves; then lay the skirts over level with the collar,
    so that the crease may fall about the centre, and double one
    half over the other, so as the fold comes in the centre of the
    back.

2181. Having got through his dirty work, the single footman has now to clean himself and prepare
the breakfast. He lays the cloth on the table; over it the breakfast-cloth, and sets the breakfast
things in order, and then proceeds to wait upon his master, if he has any of the duties of
a valet to perform.

2182. Where a valet is not kept, a portion of his duties falls to the footman's share,--brushing
the clothes among others. When the hat is silk, it requires brushing every day with a soft
brush; after rain, it requires wiping the way of the nap before drying, and, when nearly dry,
brushing with the soft brush and with the hat-stick in it. If the footman is required to perform
any part of a valet's duties, he will have to see that the housemaid lights a fire in the dressing-room
in due time; that the room is dusted and cleaned; that the washhand-ewer is filled with soft
water; and that the bath, whether hot or cold, is ready when required; that towels are at hand;
that hair-brushes and combs are properly cleansed, and in their places; that hot water is ready
at the hour ordered; the dressing-gown and slippers in their place, the clean linen aired,
and the clothes to be worn for the day in their proper places. After the master has dressed,
it will be the footman's duty to restore everything to its place properly cleansed and dry,
and the whole restored to order.

2183. At breakfast, when there is no butler, the footman carries up the tea-urn, and, assisted
by the housemaid, he waits during breakfast. Breakfast over, he removes the tray and other
things off the table, folds up the breakfast-cloth, and sets the room in order, by sweeping
up all crumbs, shaking the cloth, and laying it on the table again, making up the fire, and
sweeping up the hearth.

2184. At luncheon-time nearly the same routine is observed, except where the footman is either
out with the carriage or away on other business, when, in the absence of any butler, the housemaid
must assist.

2185. For dinner, the footman lays the cloth, taking care that the table is not too near the
fire, if there is one, and that passage-room is left. A tablecloth should be laid without a
wrinkle; and this requires two persons: over this the slips are laid, which are usually removed
preparatory to placing dessert on the table. He prepares knives, forks, and glasses, with five
or six plates for each person. This done, he places chairs enough for the party, distributing
them equally on each side of the table, and opposite to each a napkin neatly folded, within
it a piece of bread or small roll, and a knife on the right side of each plate, a fork on the
left, and a carving-knife and fork at the top and bottom of the table, outside the others,
with the rests opposite to them, and a gravy-spoon beside the knife. The fish-slice should
be at the top, where the lady of the house, with the assistance of the gentleman next to her,
divides the fish, and the soup-ladle at the bottom: it is sometimes usual to add a dessert-knife
and fork; at the same time, on the right side also of each plate, put a wine-glass for as many
kinds of wine as it is intended to hand round, and a finger-glass or glass-cooler about four
inches from the edge. The latter are frequently put on the table with the dessert.

2186. About half an hour before dinner, he rings the dinner-bell, where that is the practice,
and occupies himself with carrying up everything he is likely to require. At the expiration
of the time, having communicated with the cook, he rings the real dinner-bell, and proceeds
to take it up with such assistance as he can obtain. Having ascertained that all is in order,
that his own dress is clean and presentable, and his white cotton gloves are without a stain,
he announces in the drawing-room that dinner is served, and stands respectfully by the door
until the company are seated: he places himself on the left, behind his master, who is to distribute
the soup; where soup and fish are served together, his place will be at his mistress's left
hand; but he must be on the alert to see that whoever is assisting him, whether male or female,
are at their posts. If any of the guests has brought his own servant with him, his place is
behind his master's chair, rendering such assistance to others as he can, while attending to
his master's wants throughout the dinner, so that every guest has what he requires. This necessitates
both activity and intelligence, and should be done without bustle, without asking any questions,
except where it is the custom of the house to hand round dishes or wine, when it will be necessary
to mention, in a quiet and unobtrusive manner, the dish or wine you present.

    2187. Salt-cellars should be placed on the table in number
    sufficient for the guests, so that each may help themselves, or,
    at least, their immediate neighbours.

    DINNERS À LA RUSSE.

    2188. In some houses the table is laid out with plate and glass,
    and ornamented with flowers, the dessert only being placed on
    the table, the dinner itself being placed on the sideboard, and
    handed round in succession, in courses of soup, fish, entries,
    meat, game, and sweets. This is not only elegant but economical,
    as fewer dishes are required, the symmetry of the table being
    made up with the ornaments and dessert. The various dishes are
    also handed round when hot; but it involves additional and
    superior attendance, as the wines are also handed round; and
    unless the servants are very active and intelligent, many
    blunders are likely to be made. (See p. 954.)

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.

2189. While attentive to all, the footman should be obtrusive to none; he should give nothing
but on a waiter, and always hand it with the left hand and on the left side of the person he
serves, and hold it so that the guest may take it with ease. In lifting dishes from the table,
he should use both hands, and remove them with care, so that nothing is spilt on the table-cloth
or on the dresses of the guests.

2190. Masters as well as servants sometimes make mistakes; but it is not expected that a servant
will correct any omissions, even if he should have time to notice them, although with the best
intentions: thus it would not be correct, for instance, if he observed that his master took
wine with the ladies all round, as some gentlemen still continue to do, but stopped at some
one:--to nudge him on the shoulder and say, as was done by the servant of a Scottish gentleman,
"What ails you at her in the green gown?" It will be better to leave the lady unnoticed than
for the servant thus to turn his master into ridicule.

2191. During dinner each person's knife, fork, plate, and spoon should be changed as soon as
he has done with it; the vegetables and sauces belonging to the different dishes presented
without remark to the guests; and the footman should tread lightly in moving round, and, if
possible, should bear in mind, if there is a wit or humorist of the party, whose good things
keep the table in a roar, that they are not expected to reach his ears.

    2192. In opening wine, let it be done quietly, and without
    shaking the bottle; if crusted, let it be inclined to the
    crusted side, and decanted while in that position. In opening
    champagne, it is not necessary to discharge it with a pop;
    properly cooled, the cork is easily extracted without an
    explosion; when the cork is out, the mouth of the bottle should
    be wiped with the napkin over the footman's arm.

2193. At the end of the first course, notice is conveyed to the cook, who is waiting to send
up the second, which is introduced in the same way as before; the attendants who remove the
fragments, carrying the dishes from the kitchen, and handing them to the footman or butler,
whose duty it is to arrange them on the table. After dinner, the dessert-glasses and wines
are placed on the table by the footman, who places himself behind his master's chair, to supply
wine and hand round the ices and other refreshments, all other servants leaving the room.

2194. As soon as the drawing-room bell rings for tea, the footman enters with the tray, which
has been previously prepared; hands the tray round to the company, with cream and sugar, the
tea and coffee being generally poured out, while another attendant hands cakes, toast, or biscuits.
If it is an ordinary family party, where this social meal is prepared by the mistress, he carries
the urn or kettle, as the case may be; hands round the toast, or such other eatable as may
be required, removing the whole in the same manner when tea is over.

    2195. After each meal, the footman's place is in his pantry:
    here perfect order should prevail--a place for everything and
    everything in its place. A sink, with hot and cold water laid
    on, is very desirable,--cold absolutely necessary. Wooden bowls
    or tubs of sufficient capacity are required, one for hot and
    another for cold water. Have the bowl three parts full of clean
    hot water; in this wash all plate and plated articles which are
    greasy, wiping them before cleaning with the brush.

    2196. The footman in small families, where only one man is kept,
    has many of the duties of the upper servants to perform as well
    as his own, and more constant occupation; he will also have the
    arrangement of his time more immediately under his own control,
    and he will do well to reduce it to a methodical division. All
    his rough work should be done before breakfast is ready, when he
    must appear clean, and in a presentable state. After breakfast,
    when everything belonging to his pantry is cleaned and put in
    its place, the furniture in the dining and drawing rooms
    requires rubbing. Towards noon, the parlour luncheon is to be
    prepared; and he must be at his mistress's disposal to go out
    with the carriage, or follow her if she walks out.

    2197. Glass is a beautiful and most fragile article: hence it
    requires great care in washing. A perfectly clean wooden bowl is
    best for this operation, one for moderately hot and another for
    cold water. Wash the glasses well in the first and rinse them in
    the second, and turn them down on a linen cloth folded two or
    three times, to drain for a few minutes. When sufficiently
    drained, wipe them with a cloth and polish with a finer one,
    doing so tenderly and carefully. Accidents will happen; but
    nothing discredits a servant in the drawing-room more than
    continual reports of breakages, which, of course, must reach
    that region.

    2198. Decanters and water-jugs require still more tender
    treatment in cleaning, inasmuch as they are more costly to
    replace. Fill them about two-thirds with hot but not boiling
    water, and put in a few pieces of well-soaped brown paper; leave
    them thus for two or three hours; then shake the water up and
    down in the decanters; empty this out, rinse them well with
    clean cold water, and put them in a rack to drain. When dry,
    polish them outside and inside, as far as possible, with a fine
    cloth. To remove the crust of port or other wines, add a little
    muriatic acid to the water, and let it remain for some time.

2199. When required to go out with the carriage, it is the footman's duty to see that it has
come to the door perfectly clean, and that the glasses, and sashes, and linings, are free from
dust. In receiving messages at the carriage door, he should turn his ear to the speaker, so
as to comprehend what is said, in order that he may give his directions to the coachman clearly.
When the house he is to call at is reached, he should knock, and return to the carriage for
orders. In closing the door upon the family, he should see that the handle is securely turned,
and that no part of the ladies' dress is shut in.

2200. It is the footman's duty to carry messages or letters for his master or mistress to their
friends, to the post, or to the tradespeople; and nothing is more important than dispatch and
exactness in doing so, although writing even the simplest message is now the ordinary and very
proper practice. Dean Swift, among his other quaint directions, all of which are to be read
by contraries, recommends a perusal of all such epistles, in order that you may be the more
able to fulfil your duty to your master. An old lady of Forfarshire had one of those odd old
Caleb Balderston sort of servants, who construed the Dean of St. Patrick more literally. On
one occasion, when dispatch was of some importance, knowing his inquiring nature, she called
her Scotch Paul Pry to her, opened the note, and read it to him herself, saying, "Now, Andrew,
you ken a' aboot it, and needna' stop to open and read it, but just take it at once." Probably
most of the notes you are expected to carry might, with equal harmlessness, be communicated
to you; but it will be better not to take so lively an interest in your mistress's affairs.

2201. Politeness and civility to visitors is one of the things masters and mistresses have
a right to expect, and should exact rigorously. When visitors present themselves, the servant
charged with the duty of opening the door will open it promptly, and answer, without hesitation,
if the family are "not at home," or "engaged;" which generally means the same thing, and might
be oftener used with advantage to morals. On the contrary, if he has no such orders, he will
answer affirmatively, open the door wide to admit them, and precede them to open the door of
the drawing-room. If the family are not there, he will place chairs for them, open the blinds
(if the room is too dark), and intimate civilly that he goes to inform his mistress. If the
lady is in her drawing-room, he announces the name of the visitors, having previously acquainted
himself with it. In this part of his duty it is necessary to be very careful to repeat the
names correctly; mispronouncing names is very apt to give offence, and leads sometimes to other
disagreeables. The writer was once initiated into some of the secrets on the "other side" of
a legal affair in which he took an interest, before he could correct a mistake made by the
servant in announcing him. When the visitor is departing, the servant should be at hand, ready,
when rung for, to open the door; he should open it with a respectful manner, and close it gently
when the visitors are fairly beyond the threshold. When several visitors arrive together, he
should take care not to mix up the different names together, where they belong to the same
family, as Mr., Mrs., and Miss; if they are strangers, he should announce each as distinctly
as possible.

2202. Receptions and Evening Parties.--The drawing-rooms being prepared, the card-tables laid
out with cards and counters, and such other arrangements as are necessary made for the reception
of the company, the rooms should be lighted up as the hour appointed approaches. Attendants
in the drawing-room, even more than in the dining-room, should move about actively but noiselessly;
no creaking of shoes, which is an abomination; watching the lights from time to time, so as
to keep up their brilliancy. But even if the attendant likes a game of cribbage or whist himself,
he must not interfere in his master or mistress's game, nor even seem to take an interest in
it. We once knew a lady who had a footman, and both were fond of a game of cribbage,--John
in the kitchen, the lady in her drawing-room. The lady was a giver of evening parties, where
she frequently enjoyed her favourite amusement. While handing about the tea and toast, John
could not always suppress his disgust at her mistakes. "There is more in that hand, ma'am,"
he has been known to say; or, "Ma'am, you forgot to count his nob;" in fact, he identified
himself with his mistress's game, and would have lost twenty places rather than witness a miscount.
It is not necessary to adopt his example on this point, although John had many qualities a
good servant might copy with advantage.

THE COACHHOUSE AND STABLES.

    2203. THE HORSE is the noblest of quadrupeds, whether we view
    him in his strength, his sagacity, or his beauty. He is also the
    most useful to man of all the animal creation; but his delicacy
    is equal to his power and usefulness. No other animal, probably,
    is so dependent on man in the state of domestication to which he
    has been reduced, or deteriorates so rapidly under exposure, bad
    feeding, or bad grooming. It is, therefore, a point of humanity,
    not to speak of its obvious impolicy, for the owner of horses to
    overlook any neglect in their feeding or grooming. His interest
    dictates that so valuable an animal should be well housed, well
    fed, and well groomed; and he will do well to acquire so much of
    stable lore as will enable him to judge of these points himself.
    In a general way, where a horse's coat is habitually rough and
    untidy, there is a sad want of elbow-grease in the stable. When
    a horse of tolerable breeding is dull and spiritless, he is
    getting ill or badly fed; and where he is observed to perspire
    much in the stables, is overfed, and probably eats his litter in
    addition to his regular supply of food.

    2204. Stables.--The architectural form of the stables will be
    subject to other influences than ours; we confine ourselves,
    therefore, to their internal arrangements. They should be roomy
    in proportion to the number of stalls; warm, with good
    ventilation, and perfectly free from cold draughts; the stalls
    roomy, without excess, with good and well-trapped drainage, so
    as to exclude bad smells; a sound ceiling to prevent the
    entrance of dust from the hayloft, which is usually above them;
    and there should be plenty of light, coming, however, either
    from above or behind, so as not to glare in the horse's eye.

    2205. Heat.--The first of these objects is attained, if the
    stables are kept within a degree or two of 50° in winter, and
    60° in summer; although some grooms insist on a much higher
    temperature, in the interests of their own labour.

    2206. Ventilation is usually attained by the insertion of one
    or more tubes or boxes of wood or iron through the ceiling and
    the roof, with a sloping covering over the opening, to keep out
    rain, and valves or ventilators below to regulate the
    atmosphere, with openings in the walls for the admission of
    fresh air: this is still a difficulty, however; for the
    effluvium of the stable is difficult to dispel, and draughts
    must be avoided. This is sometimes accomplished by means of
    hollow walls with gratings at the bottom outside, for the exit
    of bad air, which is carried down through the hollow walls and
    discharged at the bottom, while, for the admission of fresh air,
    the reverse takes place: the fresh by this means gets diffused
    and heated before it is discharged into the stable.

    2207. The Stalls should be divided by partitions of wood-work
    eight or nine feet high at the head and six at the heels, and
    nine feet deep, so as to separate each horse from its neighbour.
    A hay-rack placed within easy reach of the horse, of wood or
    iron, occupies either a corner or the whole breadth of the
    stall, which should be about six feet for on ordinary-sized
    horse. A manger, formerly of wood, but of late years more
    generally of iron lined with enamel, occupies a corner of the
    stall. The pavement of the stall should be nearly level, with a
    slight incline towards the gutter, to keep the bed dry, paved
    with hard Dutch brick laid on edge, or asphalte, or smithy
    clinkers, or rubble-stones, laid in strong cement. In the
    centre, about five feet from the wall, a grating should be
    firmly fixed in the pavement, and in communication with a
    well-trapped drain to carry off the water; the gutter outside
    the stall should also communicate with the drains by trapped
    openings. The passage between the stall and the hall should be
    from five to six feet broad at least; on the wall, opposite to
    each stall, pegs should be placed for receiving the harness and
    other things in daily use.

    2208. A Harness-room is indispensable to every stable. It
    should be dry and airy, and furnished with a fireplace and
    boiler, both for the protection of the harness and to prepare
    mashes for the horses when required. The partition-wall should
    be boarded where the harness goes, with pegs to hang the various
    pieces of harness on, with saddle-trees to rest the saddles on,
    a cupboard for the brushes, sponges, and leathers, and a lock-up
    corn-bin.

    2209. The furniture of a stable with coachhouse, consists of
    coach-mops, jacks for raising the wheels, horse-brushes,
    spoke-brushes, water-brushes, crest and bit-brushes,
    dandy-brushes, currycombs, birch and heath brooms,
    trimming-combs, scissors and pickers, oil-cans and brushes,
    harness-brushes of three sorts, leathers, sponges for horse and
    carriage, stable-forks, dung-baskets or wheelbarrow, corn-sieves
    and measures, horse-cloths and stable pails, horn or glass
    lanterns. Over the stables there should be accommodation for the
    coachman or groom to sleep. Accidents sometimes occur, and he
    should be at hand to interfere.

DUTIES OF THE COACHMAN, GROOM, AND STABLE-BOY.

2210. The Establishment we have in view will consist of coachman, groom, and stable-boy, who
are capable of keeping in perfect order four horses, and perhaps the pony. Of this establishment
the coachman is chief. Besides skill in driving, he should possess a good general knowledge
of horses; he has usually to purchase provender, to see that the horses are regularly fed and
properly groomed, watch over their condition, apply simple remedies to trifling ailments in
the animals under his charge, and report where he observes symptoms of more serious ones which
he does not understand. He has either to clean the carriage himself, or see that the stable-boy
does it properly.

2211. The Groom's first duties are to keep his horses in condition; but he is sometimes expected
to perform the duties of a valet, to ride out with his master, on occasions, to wait at table,
and otherwise assist in the house: in these cases, he should have the means of dressing himself,
and keeping his clothes entirely away from the stables. In the morning, about six o'clock,
or rather before, the stables should be opened and cleaned out, and the horses fed, first by
cleaning the rack and throwing in fresh hay, putting it lightly in the rack, that the horses
may get it out easily; a short time afterwards their usual morning feed of oats should be put
into the manger. While this is going on, the stable-boy has been removing the stable-dung,
and sweeping and washing out the stables, both of which should be done every day, and every
corner carefully swept, in order to keep the stable sweet and clean. The real duties of the
groom follow: where the horses are not taken out for early exercise, the work of grooming immediately
commences. "Having tied up the head," to use the excellent description of the process given
by old Barrett, "take a currycomb and curry him all over the body, to raise the dust, beginning
first at the neck, holding the left cheek of the headstall in the left hand, and curry him
from the setting-on of his head all over the body to the buttocks, down to the point of the
hock; then change your hands, and curry him before, on his breast, and, laying your right arm
over his back, join your right side to his left, and curry him all under the belly near the
fore-bowels, and so all over from the knees and back upwards; after that, go to the far side
and do that likewise. Then take a dead horse's tail, or, failing that, a cotton dusting-cloth,
and strike that away which the currycomb hath raised. Then take a round brush made of bristles,
with a leathern handle, and dress him all over, both head, body, and legs, to the very fetlocks,
always cleansing the brush from the dust by rubbing it with the currycomb. In the curry-combing
process, as well as brushing, it must be applied with mildness, especially with fine-skinned
horses; otherwise the tickling irritates them much. The brushing is succeeded by a hair-cloth,
with which rub him all over again very hard, both to take away loose hairs and lay his coat;
then wash your hands in fair water, and rub him all over while they are wet, as well over the
head as the body. Lastly, take a clean cloth, and rub him all over again till he be dry; then
take another hair-cloth, and rub all his legs exceeding well from the knees and hocks downwards
to his hoofs, picking and dressing them very carefully about the fetlocks, so as to remove
all gravel and dust which will sometimes lie in the bending of the joints." In addition to
the practice of this old writer, modern grooms add wisping, which usually follows brushing.
The best wisp is made from a hayband, untwisted, and again doubled up after being moistened
with water: this is applied to every part of the body, as the brushing had been, by changing
the hands, taking care in all these operations to carry the hand in the direction of the coat.
Stains on the hair are removed by sponging, or, when the coat is very dirty, by the water-brush;
the whole being finished off by a linen or flannel cloth. The horsecloth should now be put
on by taking the cloth in both hands, with the outside next you, and, with your right hand
to the off side, throw it over his back, placing it no farther back than will leave it straight
and level, which will be about a foot from the tail. Put the roller round, and the pad-piece
under it, about six or eight inches from the fore legs. The horse's head is now loosened; he
is turned about in his stall to have his head and ears rubbed and brushed over every part,
including throat, with the dusting-cloth, finishing by "pulling his ears," which all horses
seem to enjoy very much. This done, the mane and foretop should be combed out, passing a wet
sponge over them, sponging the mane on both sides, by throwing it back to the midriff, to make
it lie smooth. The horse is now returned to his headstall, his tail combed out, cleaning it
of stains with a wet brush or sponge, trimming both tail and mane, and forelock when necessary,
smoothing them down with a brush on which a little oil has been dropped.

    2212. Watering usually follows dressing; but some horses refuse
    their food until they have drunk: the groom should not,
    therefore, lay down exclusive rules on this subject, but study
    the temper and habits of his horse.

    2213. Exercise.--All horses not in work require at least two
    hours' exercise daily; and in exercising them a good groom will
    put them through the paces to which they have been trained. In
    the case of saddle-horses he will walk, trot, canter, and gallop
    them, in order to keep them up to their work. With draught
    horses they ought to be kept up to a smart walk and trot.

    2214. Feeding must depend on their work, but they require
    feeding three times a day, with more or less corn each time,
    according to their work. In the fast coaching days it was a
    saying among proprietors, that "his belly was the measure of his
    food;" but the horse's appetite is not to be taken as a
    criterion of the quantity of food under any circumstances.
    Horses have been known to consume 40 lbs. of hay in twenty-four
    hours, whereas 16 lbs. to 18 lbs. is the utmost which should
    have been given. Mr. Croall, an extensive coach proprietor in
    Scotland, limited his horses to 4-1/2 lbs. cut straw, 8 lbs.
    bruised oats, and 2-1/2 lbs. bruised beans, in the morning and
    noon, giving them at night 25 lbs. of the following; viz., 560
    lbs. steamed potatoes, 36 lbs. barley-dust, 40 lbs. cut straw,
    and 6 lbs. salt, mixed up together: under this the horses did
    their work well. The ordinary measure given a horse is a peck of
    oats, about 40 lbs. to the bushel, twice a day, a third feed and
    a rack-full of hay, which may be about 15 lbs. or 18 lbs., when
    he is in full work.

    2215. You cannot take up a paper without having the question
    put, "Do you bruise your oats?" Well, that depends on
    circumstances: a fresh young horse can bruise its own oats when
    it can get them; but aged horses, after a time, lose the power
    of masticating and bruising them, and bolt them whole; thus much
    impeding the work of digestion. For an old horse, then, bruise
    the oats; for a young one it does no harm and little good. Oats
    should be bright and dry, and not too new. Where they are new,
    sprinkle them with salt and water; otherwise, they overload the
    horse's stomach. Chopped straw mixed with oats, in the
    proportion of a third of straw or hay, is a good food for horses
    in full work; and carrots, of which horses are remarkably fond,
    have a perceptible effect in a short time on the gloss of the
    coat.

    2216. The water given to a horse merits some attention; it
    should not be too cold; hard water is not to be recommended;
    stagnant or muddy water is positively injurious; river water is
    the best for all purposes; and anything is preferable to spring
    water, which should be exposed to the sun in summer for an hour
    or two, and stirred up before using it; a handful of oatmeal
    thrown into the pail will much improve its quality.

    2217. Shoeing.--A horse should not be sent on a journey or any
    other hard work immediately after new shoeing;--the stiffness
    incidental to new shoes is not unlikely to bring him down. A
    day's rest, with reasonable exercise, will not be thrown away
    after this operation. On reaching home very hot, the groom
    should walk him about for a few minutes; this done, he should
    take off the moisture with the scraper, and afterwards wisp him
    over with a handful of straw and a flannel cloth: if the cloth
    is dipped in some spirit, all the better. He should wash, pick,
    and wipe dry the legs and feet, take off the bridle and crupper,
    and fasten it to the rack, then the girths, and put a wisp of
    straw under the saddle. When sufficiently cool, the horse should
    have some hay given him, and then a feed of oats: if he refuse
    the latter, offer him a little wet bran, or a handful of oatmeal
    in tepid water. When he has been fed, he should be thoroughly
    cleaned, and his body-clothes put on, and, if very much harassed
    with fatigue, a little good ale or wine will be well bestowed on
    a valuable horse, adding plenty of fresh litter under the belly.

    2218. Bridles.--Every time a horse is unbridled, the bit
    should be carefully washed and dried, and the leather wiped, to
    keep them sweet, as well as the girths and saddle, the latter
    being carefully dried and beaten with a switch before it is
    again put on. In washing a horse's feet after a day's work, the
    master should insist upon the legs and feet being washed
    thoroughly with a sponge until the water flows over them, and
    then rubbed with a brush till quite dry.

    2219. Harness, if not carefully preserved, very soon gets a
    shabby tarnished appearance. Where the coachman has a proper
    harness-room and sufficient assistance, this is inexcusable and
    easily prevented. The harness-room should have a wooden lining
    all round, and be perfectly dry and well ventilated. Around the
    walls, hooks and pegs should be placed, for the several pieces
    of harness, at such a height as to prevent their touching the
    ground; and every part of the harness should have its peg or
    hook,--one for the halters, another for the reins, and others
    for snaffles and other bits and metal-work; and either a wooden
    horse or saddle-trees for the saddles and pads. All these parts
    should be dry, clean, and shining. This is only to be done by
    careful cleaning and polishing, and the use of several requisite
    pastes. The metallic parts, when white, should be cleaned by a
    soft brush and plate-powder; the copper and brass parts
    burnished with rottenstone-powder and oil,--steel with
    emery-powder; both made into a paste with a little oil.

    2220. An excellent paste for polishing harness and the
    leather-work of carriages, is made by melting 8 lbs. of yellow
    wax, stirring it till completely dissolved. Into this pour 1 lb.
    of litharge of the shops, which has been pounded up with water,
    and dried and sifted through a sieve, leaving the two, when
    mixed, to simmer on the fire, stirring them continually till all
    is melted. When it is a little cool, mix this with 1-1/4 lb. of
    good ivory-black; place this again on the fire, and stir till it
    boils anew, and suffer it to cool. When cooled a little, add
    distilled turpentine till it has the consistence of a thickish
    paste, scenting it with any essence at hand, thinning it when
    necessary from time to time, by adding distilled turpentine.

    2221. When the leather is old and greasy, it should be cleaned
    before applying this polish, with a brush wetted in a weak
    solution of potass and water, washing afterwards with soft river
    water, and drying thoroughly. If the leather is not black, one
    or two coats of black ink may be given before applying the
    polish. When quite dry, the varnish should be laid on with a
    soft shoe-brush, using also a soft brush to polish the leather.

    2222. When the leather is very old, it may be softened with
    fish-oil, and, after putting on the ink, a sponge charged with
    distilled turpentine passed over, to scour the surface of the
    leather, which should be polished as above.

    2223. For fawn or yellow-coloured leather, take a quart of
    skimmed milk, pour into it 1 oz. of sulphuric acid, and, when
    cold, add to it 4 oz. of hydrochloric acid, shaking the bottle
    gently until it ceases to emit white vapours; separate the
    coagulated from the liquid part, by straining through a sieve,
    and store it away till required. In applying it, clean the
    leather by a weak solution of oxalic acid, washing it off
    immediately, and apply the composition when dry with a sponge.

    2224. Wheel-grease is usually purchased at the shops; but a
    good paste is made as follows:--Melt 80 parts of grease, and
    stir into it, mixing it thoroughly and smoothly, 20 parts of
    fine black-lead in powder, and store away in a tin box for use.
    This grease is used in the mint at Paris, and is highly
    approved.

    2225. Carriages in an endless variety of shapes and names are
    continually making their appearance; but the hackney cab or
    clarence seems most in request for light carriages; the family
    carriage of the day being a modified form of the clarence
    adapted for family use. The carriage is a valuable piece of
    furniture, requiring all the care of the most delicate
    upholstery, with the additional disadvantage of continual
    exposure to the weather and to the muddy streets.

2216. It requires, therefore, to be carefully cleaned before putting away, and a coach-house
perfectly dry and well ventilated, for the wood-work swells with moisture; it shrinks also
with heat, unless the timber has undergone a long course of seasoning: it should also have
a dry floor, a boarded one being recommended. It must be removed from the ammoniacal influence
of the stables, from open drains and cesspools, and other gaseous influences likely to affect
the paint and varnish. When the carriage returns home, it should be carefully washed and dried,
and that, if possible, before the mud has time to dry on it. This is done by first well slushing
it with clean water, so as to wash away all particles of sand, having first closed the sashes
to avoid wetting the linings. The body is then gone carefully over with a soft mop, using plenty
of clean water, and penetrating into every corner of the carved work, so that not an atom of
dirt remains; the body of the carriage is then raised by placing the jack under the axletree
and raising it so that the wheel turns freely; this is now thoroughly washed with the mop until
the dirt is removed, using a water-brush for corners where the mop does not penetrate. Every
particle of mud and sand removed by the mop, and afterwards with a wet sponge, the carriage
is wiped dry, and, as soon after as possible, the varnish is carefully polished with soft leather,
using a little sweet oil for the leather parts, and even for the panels, so as to check any
tendency of the varnish to crack. Stains are removed by rubbing them with the leather and sweet
oil; if that fails, a little Tripoli powder mixed with the oil will be more successful.

2227. In preparing the carriage for use, the whole body should be rubbed over with a clean
leather and carefully polished, the iron-work and joints oiled, the plated and brass-work occasionally
cleaned,--the one with plate-powder, or with well-washed whiting mixed with sweet oil, and
leather kept for the purpose,--the other with rottenstone mixed with a little oil, and applied
without too much rubbing, until the paste is removed; but, if rubbed every day with the leather,
little more will be required to keep it untarnished. The linings require careful brushing every
day, the cushions being taken out and beaten, and the glass sashes should always be bright
and clean. The wheel-tires and axletree are carefully seen to, and greased when required, the
bolts and nuts tightened, and all the parts likely to get out of order overhauled.

2228. These duties, however, are only incidental to the coachman's office, which is to drive;
and much of the enjoyment of those in the carriage depends on his proficiency in his art,--much
also of the wear of the carriage and horses. He should have sufficient knowledge of the construction
of the carriage to know when it is out of order,--to know, also, the pace at which he can go
over the road he has under him, without risking the springs, and without shaking those he is
driving too much.

2229. Having, with or without the help of the groom or stable-boy, put his horses to the carriage,
and satisfied himself, by walking round them, that everything is properly arranged, the coachman
proceeds to the off-side of the carriage, takes the reins from the back of the horses, where
they were thrown, buckles them together, and, placing his foot on the step, ascends to his
box, having his horses now entirely under control. In ordinary circumstances, he is not expected
to descend, for where no footman accompanies the carriage, the doors are usually so arranged
that even a lady may let herself out, if she wishes it, from the inside. The coachman's duties
are to avoid everything approaching an accident, and all his attention is required to guide
his horses.

    2230. The pace at which he drives will depend upon his
    orders,--in all probability a moderate pace of seven or eight
    miles an hour; less speed is injurious to the horses, getting
    them into lazy and sluggish habits; for it is wonderful how soon
    these are acquired by some horses. The writer was once employed
    to purchase a horse for a country friend, and he picked a very
    handsome gelding out of Collins's stables, which seemed to
    answer to his friend's wants. It was duly committed to the
    coachman who was to drive it, after some very successful trials
    in harness and out of it, and seemed likely to give great
    satisfaction. After a time, the friend got tired of his
    carriage, and gave it up; as the easiest mode of getting rid of
    the horse, it was sent up to the writer's stables,--a present.
    Only twelve months had elapsed; the horse was as handsome as
    ever, with plenty of flesh, and a sleek glossy coat, and he was
    thankfully enough received; but, on trial, it was found that a
    stupid coachman, who was imbued with one of their old maxims,
    that "it's the pace that kills," had driven the horse, capable
    of doing his nine miles an hour with ease, at a jog-trot of four
    miles, or four and a half; and now, no persuasion of the whip
    could get more out of him. After many unsuccessful efforts to
    bring him back to his pace, in one of which a break-down
    occurred, under the hands of a professional trainer, he was sent
    to the hammer, and sold for a sum that did not pay for the
    attempt to break him in. This maxim, therefore, "that it's the
    pace that kills," is altogether fallacious in the moderate sense
    in which we are viewing it. In the old coaching days, indeed,
    when the Shrewsbury "Wonder" drove into the inn yard while the
    clock was striking, week after week and mouth after month, with
    unerring regularity, twenty-seven hours to a hundred and
    sixty-two miles; when the "Quicksilver" mail was timed to eleven
    miles an hour between London and Plymouth, with a fine of £5 to
    the driver if behind time; when the Brighton "Age," "tool'd" and
    horsed by the late Mr. Stevenson, used to dash round the square
    as the fifth hour was striking, having stopped at the half-way
    house while his servant handed a sandwich and a glass of sherry
    to his passengers,--then the pace was indeed "killing." But the
    truth is, horses that are driven at a jog-trot pace lose that
    élan with which a good driver can inspire them, and they are
    left to do their work by mere weight and muscle; therefore,
    unless he has contrary orders, a good driver will choose a smart
    pace, but not enough to make his horses perspire: on level roads
    this should never be seen.

    2231. In choosing his horses, every master will see that they
    are properly paired,--that their paces are about equal. When
    their habits differ, it is the coachman's duty to discover how
    he can, with least annoyance to the horses, get that pace out of
    them. Some horses have been accustomed to be driven on the
    check, and the curb irritates them; others, with harder mouths,
    cannot be controlled with the slight leverage this affords; he
    must, therefore, accommodate the horses as he best can. The
    reins should always be held so that the horses are "in hand;"
    but he is a very bad driver who always drives with a tight rein;
    the pain to the horse is intolerable, and causes him to rear and
    plunge, and finally break sway, if he can. He is also a bad
    driver when the reins are always slack; the horse then feels
    abandoned to himself; he is neither directed nor supported, and
    if no accident occurs, it is great good luck.

2232. The true coachman's hands are so delicate and gentle, that the mere weight of the reins
is felt on the bit, and the directions are indicated by a turn of the wrist rather than by
a pull; the horses are guided and encouraged, and only pulled up when they exceed their intended
pace, or in the event of a stumble; for there is a strong though gentle hand on the reins.

2233. The Whip, in the hands of a good driver, and with well-bred cattle, is there, more as
a precaution than a "tool" for frequent use; if he uses it, it is to encourage, by stroking
the flanks; except, indeed, he has to punish some waywardness of temper, and then he does it
effectually, taking care, however, that it is done on the flank, where there is no very tender
part, never on the crupper. In driving, the coachman should never give way to temper. How often
do we see horses stumble from being conducted, or at least "allowed," to go over bad ground
by some careless driver, who immediately wreaks that vengeance on the poor horse which might,
with much more justice, be applied to his own brutal shoulders. The whip is of course useful,
and even necessary, but should be rarely used, except to encourage and excite the horses.

DUTIES OF THE VALET.

2234. Attendants on the Person.-"No man is a hero to his valet," saith the proverb; and the
corollary may run, "No lady is a heroine to her maid." The infirmities of humanity are, perhaps,
too numerous and too equally distributed to stand the severe microscopic tests which attendants
on the person have opportunities of applying. The valet and waiting-maid are placed near the
persons of the master and mistress, receiving orders only from them, dressing them, accompanying
them in all their journeys, the confidants and agents of their most unguarded moments, of their
most secret habits, and of course subject to their commands,--even to their caprices; they
themselves being subject to erring judgment, aggravated by an imperfect education. All that
can be expected from such servants is polite manners, modest demeanour, and a respectful reserve,
which are indispensable. To these, good sense, good temper, some self-denial, and consideration
for the feelings of others, whether above or below them in the social scale, will be useful
qualifications. Their duty leads them to wait on those who are, from sheer wealth, station,
and education, more polished, and consequently more susceptible of annoyance; and any vulgar
familiarity of manner is opposed to all their notions of self-respect. Quiet unobtrusive manners,
therefore, and a delicate reserve in speaking of their employers, either in praise or blame,
is as essential in their absence, as good manners and respectful conduct in their presence.

2235. Some of the duties of the valet we have just hinted at in treating of the duties of the
footman in a small family. His day commences by seeing that his master's dressing-room is in
order; that the housemaid has swept and dusted it properly; that the fire is lighted and burns
cheerfully; and some time before his master is expected, he will do well to throw up the sash
to admit fresh air, closing it, however, in time to recover the temperature which he knows
his master prefers. It is now his duty to place the body-linen on the horse before the fire,
to be aired properly; to lay the trousers intended to be worn, carefully brushed and cleaned,
on the back of his master's chair; while the coat and waistcoat, carefully brushed and folded,
and the collar cleaned, are laid in their place ready to put on when required. All the articles
of the toilet should be in their places, the razors properly set and stropped, and hot water
ready for use.

2236. Gentlemen generally prefer performing the operation of shaving themselves, but a valet
should be prepared to do it if required; and he should, besides, be a good hairdresser. Shaving
over, he has to brush the hair, beard, and moustache, where that appendage is encouraged, arranging
the whole simply and gracefully, according to the age and style of countenance. Every fortnight,
or three weeks at the utmost, the hair should be cut, and the points of the whiskers trimmed
as often as required. A good valet will now present the various articles of the toilet as they
are wanted; afterwards, the body-linen, neck-tie, which he will put on, if required, and, afterwards,
waistcoat, coat, and boots, in suitable order, and carefully brushed and polished.

2237. Having thus seen his master dressed, if he is about to go out, the valet will hand him
his cane, gloves, and hat, the latter well brushed on the outside with a soft brush, and wiped
inside with a clean handkerchief, respectfully attend him to the door, and open it for him,
and receive his last orders for the day.

2238. He now proceeds to put everything in order in the dressing-room, cleans the combs and
brushes, and brushes and folds up any clothes that may be left about the room, and puts them
away in the drawers.

2239. Gentlemen are sometimes indifferent as to their clothes and appearance; it is the valet's
duty, in this case, where his master permits it, to select from the wardrobe such things as
are suitable for the occasion, so that he may appear with scrupulous neatness and cleanliness;
that his linen and neck-tie, where that is white or coloured, are unsoiled; and where he is
not accustomed to change them every day, that the cravat is turned, and even ironed, to remove
the crease of the previous fold. The coat collar,--which where the hair is oily and worn long,
is apt to get greasy--should also be examined; a careful valet will correct this by removing
the spots day by day as they appear, first by moistening the grease-spots with a little rectified
spirits of wine or spirits of hartshorn, which has a renovating effect, and the smell of which
soon disappears. The grease is dissolved and removed by gentle scraping. The grease removed,
add a little more of the spirit, and rub with a piece of clean cloth; finish by adding a few
drops more; rub it with the palm of the hand, in the direction of the grain of the cloth, and
it will be clean and glossy as the rest of the garment.

    2240. Polish for the boots is an important matter to the valet,
    and not always to be obtained good by purchase; never so good,
    perhaps, as he can make for himself after the following
    recipes:--Take of ivory-black and treacle each 4 oz., sulphuric
    acid 1 oz., best olive-oil 2 spoonfuls, best white-wine vinegar
    3 half-pints: mix the ivory-black and treacle well in an earthen
    jar; then add the sulphuric acid, continuing to stir the
    mixture; next pour in the oil; and, lastly, add the vinegar,
    stirring it in by degrees, until thoroughly incorporated.

    241. Another polish is made by mixing 1 oz. each of pounded
    galls and logwood-chips, and 3 lbs. of red French vine
    (ordinaire). Boil together till the liquid is reduced to half
    the quantity, and pour it off through a strainer. Now take 1/2
    lb. each of pounded gum-arabic and lump-sugar, 1 oz. of green
    copperas, and 3 lbs. of brandy. Dissolve the gum-arabic in the
    preceding decoction, and add the sugar and copperas: when all is
    dissolved and mixed together, stir in the brandy, mixing it
    smoothly. This mixture will yield 5 or 6 lbs. of a very superior
    polishing paste for boots and shoes.

2242. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that having discharged all the commissions intrusted
to him by his master, such as conveying notes or messages to friends, or the tradesmen, all
of which he should punctually and promptly attend to, it is his duty to be in waiting when
his master returns home to dress for dinner, or for any other occasion, and to have all things
prepared for this second dressing. Previous to this, he brings under his notice the cards of
visitors who may have called, delivers the messages be may have received for him, and otherwise
acquits himself of the morning's commissions, and receives his orders for the remainder of
the day. The routine of his evening duty is to have the dressing-room and study, where there
is a separate one, arranged comfortably for his master, the fires lighted, candles prepared,
dressing-gown and slippers in their place, and aired, and everything in order that is required
for his master's comforts.

FEMALE DOMESTICS.

DUTIES OF THE LADY'S-MAID.

2243. The duties of a lady's-maid are more numerous, and perhaps more onerous, than those of
the valet; for while the latter is aided by the tailor, the hatter, the linen-draper, and the
perfumer, the lady's-maid has to originate many parts of the mistress's dress herself: she
should, indeed, be a tolerably expert milliner and dressmaker, a good hairdresser, and possess
some chemical knowledge of the cosmetics with which the toilet-table is supplied, in order
to use them with safety and effect. Her first duty in the morning, after having performed her
own toilet, is to examine the clothes put off by her mistress the evening before, either to
put them away, or to see that they are all in order to put on again. During the winter, and
in wet weather, the dresses should be carefully examined, and the mud removed. Dresses of tweed,
and other woollen materials, may be laid out on a table and brushed all over; but in general,
even in woollen fabrics, the lightness of the tissues renders brushing unsuitable to dresses,
and it is better to remove the dust from the folds by beating them lightly with a handkerchief
or thin cloth. Silk dresses should never be brushed, but rubbed with a piece of merino, or
other soft material, of a similar colour, kept for the purpose. Summer dresses of barège, muslin,
mohair, and other light materials, simply require shaking; but if the muslin be tumbled, it
must be ironed afterwards. If the dresses require slight repair, it should be done at once:
"a stitch in time saves nine."

    2244. The bonnet should be dusted with a light feather plume, in
    order to remove every particle of dust; but this has probably
    been done, as it ought to have been, the night before. Velvet
    bonnets, and other velvet articles of dress, should be cleaned
    with a soft brush. If the flowers with which the bonnet is
    decorated have been crushed or displaced, or the leaves tumbled,
    they should be raised and readjusted by means of flower-pliers.
    If feathers have suffered from damp, they should be held near
    the fire for a few minutes, and restored to their natural state
    by the hand or a soft brush.

    2245. The Chausserie, or foot-gear of a lady, is one of the
    few things left to mark her station, and requires special care.
    Satin boots or shoes should be dusted with a soft brush, or
    wiped with a cloth. Kid or varnished leather should have the mud
    wiped off with a sponge charged with milk, which preserves its
    softness and polish. The following is also an excellent polish
    for applying to ladies' boots, instead of blacking them:--Mix
    equal proportions of sweet-oil, vinegar, and treacle, with 1 oz.
    of lamp-black. When all the ingredients are thoroughly
    incorporated, rub the mixture on the boots with the palm of the
    hand, and put them in a cool place to dry. Ladies' blacking,
    which may be purchased in 6d, and 1s. bottles, is also very much
    used for patent leather and kid boots, particularly when they
    are a little worn. This blacking is merely applied with a piece
    of sponge, and the boots should not be put on until the blacking
    is dry und hardened.

2246. These various preliminary offices performed, the lady's-maid should prepare for dressing
her mistress, arranging her dressing-room, toilet-table, and linen, according to her mistress's
wishes and habits. The details of dressing we need not touch upon,--every lady has her own
mode of doing so; but the maid should move about quietly, perform any offices about her mistress's
person, as lacing stays, gently, and adjust her linen smoothly.

2247. Having prepared the dressing-room by lighting the fire, sweeping the hearth, and made
everything ready for dressing her mistress, placed her linen before the fire to air, and laid
out the various articles of dress she is to wear, which will probably have been arranged the
previous evening, the lady's-maid is prepared for the morning's duties.

2248. Hairdressing is the most important part of the lady's-maid's office. If ringlets are
worn, remove the curl-papers, and, after thoroughly brushing the back hair both above and below,
dress it according to the prevailing fashion. If bandeaux are worn, the hair is thoroughly
brushed and frizzed outside and inside, folding the hair back round the head, brushing it perfectly
smooth, giving it a glossy appearance by the use of pomades, or oil, applied by the palm of
the hand, smoothing it down with a small brush dipped in bandoline. Double bandeaux are formed
by bringing most of the hair forward, and rolling it over frizettes made of hair the same colour
as that of the wearer: it is finished behind by plaiting the hair, and arranging it in such
a manner as to look well with the head-dress.

2249. Lessons in hairdressing may be obtained, and at not an unreasonable charge. If a lady's-maid
can afford it, we would advise her to initiate herself in the mysteries of hairdressing before
entering on her duties. If a mistress finds her maid handy, and willing to learn, she will
not mind the expense of a few lessons, which are almost necessary, as the fashion and mode
of dressing the hair is so continually changing. Brushes and combs should be kept scrupulously
clean, by washing them about twice a week: to do this oftener spoils the brushes, as very frequent
washing makes them so very soft.

To wash Brushes.

2250. Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot water, allowing a piece the size of a walnut to
a quart of water. Put the water into a basin, and, after combing out the hair from the brushes,
dip them, bristles downwards, into the water and out again, keeping the backs and handles as
free from the water as possible. Repeat this until the bristles look clean; then rinse the
brushes in a little cold water; shake them well, and wipe the handles and backs with a towel,
but not the bristles, and set the brushes to dry in the sun, or near the fire; but take care
not to put them too close to it. Wiping the bristles of a brush makes them soft, as does also
the use of soap.

To clean Combs.

2251. If it can be avoided, never wash combs, as the water often makes the teeth split, and
the tortoiseshell or horn of which they are made, rough. Small brushes, manufactured purposely
for cleaning combs, may be purchased at a trifling cost: with this the comb should be well
brushed, and afterwards wiped with a cloth or towel.

A good Wash for the Hair.

2252. INGREDIENTS.--1 pennyworth of borax, 1/2 pint of olive-oil, 1 pint of boiling water.

Mode.--Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil; let it cool; then put the mixture into
a bottle. Shake it before using, and apply it with a flannel. Camphor and borax, dissolved
in boiling water and left to cool, make a very good wash for the hair; as also does rosemary-water
mixed with a little borax. After using any of these washes, when the hair becomes thoroughly
dry, a little pomatum or oil should be rubbed in, to make it smooth and glossy.

To make Pomade for the Hair.

2253. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of lard, 2 pennyworth of castor-oil; scent.

Mode.--Let the lard be unsalted; beat it up well; then add the castor-oil, and mix thoroughly
together with a knife, adding a few drops of any scent that may be preferred. Put the pomatum
into pots, which keep well covered to prevent it turning rancid.

Another Recipe for Pomatum.

2254. INGREDIENTS.--8 oz. of olive-oil, 1 oz. of spermaceti, 3 pennyworth of essential oil
of almonds, 3 pennyworth of essence of lemon.

Mode.--Mix these ingredients together, and store away in jars for use.

To make Bandoline.

2555. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of gum-tragacanth, 1/4 pint of cold water, 3 pennyworth of essence
of almonds, 2 teaspoonfuls of old rum.

Mode.--Put the gum-tragacanth into a wide-mouthed bottle with the cold water; let it stand
till dissolved, then stir into it the essence of almonds; let it remain for an hour or two,
when pour the rum on the top. This should make the stock bottle, and when any is required for
use, it is merely necessary to dilute it with a little cold water until the desired consistency
is obtained, and to keep it in a small bottle, well corked, for use. This bandoline, instead
of injuring the hair, as many other kinds often do, improves it, by increasing its growth,
and making it always smooth and glossy.

An excellent Pomatum.

2256. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of lard, 1/2 pint of olive-oil, 1/2 pint of castor-oil, 4 oz.
of spermaceti, bergamot, or any other scent; elder-flower water.

Mode.--Wash the lard well in the elder-flower water; drain, and beat it to a cream. Mix the
two oils together, and heat them sufficiently to dissolve the spermaceti, which should be beaten
fine in a mortar. Mix all these ingredients together with the brandy and whatever kind of scent
may be preferred; and whilst warm pour into glass bottles for use, keeping them well corked.
The best way to liquefy the pomatum is to set the bottle in a saucepan of warm water. It will
remain good for many months.

To promote the Growth of Hair.

2257. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of olive-oil and spirit of rosemary; a few drops of oil
of nutmeg.

Mode.--Mix the ingredients together, rub the roots of the hair every night with a little of
this liniment, and the growth of it will very soon sensibly increase.

    2258. Our further remarks on dressing must be confined to some
    general advice. In putting on a band, see that it is laid quite
    flat, and is drawn tightly round the waist before it is pinned
    in front; that the pin is a strong one, and that it is secured
    to the stays, so as not to slip up or down, or crease in the
    folds. Arrange the folds of the dress over the crinoline
    petticoats; if the dress fastens behind, put a small pin in the
    slit to prevent it from opening. See that the sleeves fall well
    over the arms. If it is finished with a jacket, or other upper
    dress, see that it fits smoothly under the arms; pull out the
    flounces, and spread out the petticoat at the bottom with the
    hands, so that it falls in graceful folds. In arranging the
    petticoat itself, a careful lady's-maid will see that this is
    firmly fastened round the waist.

    2259. Where sashes are worn, pin the bows securely on the inside
    with a pin, so as not to be visible; then raise the bow with the
    fingers. The collar is arranged and carefully adjusted with
    brooch or bow in the centre.

2260. Having dressed her mistress for breakfast, and breakfasted herself, the further duties
of the lady's-maid will depend altogether upon the habits of the family, in which hardly two
will probably agree. Where the duties are entirely confined to attendance on her mistress,
it is probable that the bedroom and dressing-room will be committed to her care; that, the
housemaid will rarely enter, except for the weekly or other periodical cleaning; she will,
therefore, have to make her mistress's bed, and keep it in order; and as her duties are light
and easy, there can be no allowance made for the slightest approach to uncleanliness or want
of order. Every morning, immediately after her mistress has left it, and while breakfast is
on, she should throw the bed open, by taking off the clothes; open the windows (except in rainy
weather), and leave the room to air for half an hour. After breakfast, except her attendance
on her mistress prevents it, if the rooms are carpeted, she should sweep them carefully, having
previously strewed the room with moist tea-leaves, dusting every table and chair, taking care
to penetrate to every corner, and moving every article of furniture that is portable. This
done satisfactorily, and having cleaned the dressing-glass, polished up the furniture and the
ornaments, and made the glass jug and basin clean and bright, emptied all slops, emptied the
water-jugs and filled them with fresh water, and arranged the rooms, the dressing-room is ready
for the mistress when she thinks proper to appear.

2261. The dressing-room thoroughly in order, the same thing is to be done in the bedroom, in
which she will probably be assisted by the housemaid to make the bed and empty the slops. In
making the bed, she will study her lady's wishes, whether it is to be hard or soft, sloping
or straight, and see that it is done accordingly.

2262. Having swept the bedroom with equal care, dusted the tables and chairs, chimney-ornaments,
and put away all articles of dress left from yesterday, and cleaned and put away any articles
of jewellery, her next care is to see, before her mistress goes out, what requires replacing
in her department, and furnish her with a list of them, that she may use her discretion about
ordering them. All this done, she may settle herself down to any work on which she is engaged.
This will consist chiefly in mending; which is first to be seen to; everything, except stockings,
being mended before washing. Plain work will probably be one of the lady's-maid's chief employments.

    2263. A waiting-maid, who wishes to make herself useful, will
    study the fashion-books with attention, so as to be able to aid
    her mistress's judgment in dressing, according to the prevailing
    fashion, with such modifications as her style of countenance
    requires. She will also, if she has her mistress's interest at
    heart, employ her spare time in repairing and making up dresses
    which have served one purpose, to serve another also, or turning
    many things, unfitted for her mistress to use, for the younger
    branches of the family. The lady's-maid may thus render herself
    invaluable to her mistress, and increase her own happiness in so
    doing. The exigencies of fashion and luxury are such, that all
    ladies, except those of the very highest rank, will consider
    themselves fortunate in having about them a thoughtful person,
    capable of diverting their finery to a useful purpose.

2264. Among other duties, the lady's-maid should understand the various processes for washing,
and cleaning, and repairing laces; edging of collars; removing stains and grease-spots from
dresses, and similar processes, for which the following recipes will be found very useful.
In washing--

    2265. Blonde, fine toilet-soap is used; the blonde is soaped
    over very slightly, and washed in water in which a little
    fig-blue is dissolved, rubbing it very gently; when clean, dry
    it. Dip it afterwards in very thin gum-water, dry it again in
    linen, spread it out as flat as it will lie, and iron it. Where
    the blonde is of better quality, and wider, it may be stretched
    on a hoop to dry after washing in the blue-water, applying the
    gum with a sponge; or it may be washed finally in water in which
    a lump of sugar has been dissolved, which gives it more the
    appearance of new blonde.

    2266. Lace collars soil very quickly when in contact with the
    neck; they are cleaned by beating the edge of the collar between
    the folds of a fine linen cloth, then washing the edges as
    directed above, and spreading it out on an ironing-board,
    pinning it at each corner with fine pins; then going carefully
    over it with a sponge charged with water in which some
    gum-dragon and fig-blue have been dissolved, to give it a proper
    consistence. To give the collar the same tint throughout, the
    whole collar should be sponged with the same water, taking care
    not to touch the flowers.

2267. A multiplicity of accidents occur to soil and spot dresses, which should be removed at
once. To remove--

    2268. Grease-spots from cotton or woollen materials of fast
    colours, absorbent pastes, purified bullock's-blood, and even
    common soap, are used, applied to the spot when dry. When the
    colours are not fast, use fuller's-earth or pulverized
    potter's-clay, laid in a layer over the spot, and press it with
    a very hot iron.

    2269. For Silks, Moires, and plain or brocaded Satins, begin by
    pouring over the spot two drops of rectified spirits of wine;
    cover it over with a linen cloth, and press it with a hot iron,
    changing the linen instantly. The spot will look tarnished, for
    a portion of the grease still remains: this will be removed
    entirely by a little sulphuric ether dropped on the spot, and a
    very little rubbing. If neatly done, no perceptible mark or
    circle will remain; nor will the lustre of the richest silk be
    changed, the union of the two liquids operating with no
    injurious effects from rubbing.

    2270. Fruit-spots are removed from white and fast-coloured
    cottons by the use of chloride of soda. Commence by cold-soaping
    the article, then touch the spot with a hair-pencil or feather
    dipped in the chloride, dipping it immediately into cold water,
    to prevent the texture of the article being injured.

    2271. Ink-spots are removed, when fresh applied to the spot,
    by a few drops of hot water being poured on immediately
    afterwards. By the same process, iron-mould in linen or calico
    may be removed, dipping immediately in cold water to prevent
    injury to the fabric.

    2272. Wax dropped on a shawl, table-cover, or cloth dress, is
    easily discharged by applying spirits of wine.

    2273. Syrups or Preserved Fruits, by washing in lukewarm water
    with a dry cloth, and pressing the spot between two folds of
    clean linen.

    2274. Essence of Lemon will remove grease, but will make a
    spot itself in a few days.

To clean Silk or Ribbons.

2275. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of gin, 1/2 lb. of honey, 1/2 lb. of soft soap, 1/2 pint of water.

Mode.--Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of silk upon a clean kitchen
table or dresser, and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mixture. Have ready three vessels
of cold water; take each piece of silk at two corners, and dip it up and down in each vessel,
but do not wring it; and take care that each breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for
the last dip. Hang it up dripping for a minute or two, then dab it in a cloth, and iron it
quickly with a very hot iron.

To remove Paint-spots from Silk Cloth.

2276. If the fabric will bear it, sharp rubbing will frequently entirely discharge a newly-made
paint-stain; but, if this is not successful, apply spirit of turpentine with a quill till the
stains disappear.

To make old Crape look nearly equal to new.

2277. Place a little water in a teakettle, and let it boil until there is plenty of steam from
the spout; then, holding the crape in both hands, pass it to and fro several times through
the steam, and it will to clean and look nearly equal to new.

2278. Linen.--Before sending linen to wash, the lady's-maid should see that everything under
her charge is properly mended; for her own sake she should take care that it is sent out in
an orderly manner, each class of garments by themselves, with a proper list, of which she retains
a copy. On its return, it is still more necessary to examine every piece separately, so that
all missing buttons be supplied, and only the articles properly washed and in perfect repair
passed into the wardrobe.

2279. Ladies who keep a waiting-maid for their own persons are in the habit of paying visits
to their friends, in which it is not unusual for the maid to accompany them; at all events,
it is her duty to pack the trunks; and this requires not only knowledge but some practice,
although the improved trunks and portmanteaus now made, in which there is a place for nearly
everything, render this more simple than formerly. Before packing, let the trunks be thoroughly
well cleaned, and, if necessary, lined with paper, and everything intended for packing laid
out on the bed or chairs, so that it may be seen what is to be stowed away; the nicer articles
of dress neatly folded in clean calico wrappers. Having satisfied herself that everything wanted
is laid out, and that it is in perfect order, the packing is commenced by disposing of the
most bulky articles, the dressing-case and work-box, skirts, and other articles requiring room,
leaving the smaller articles to fill up; finally, having satisfied herself that all is included,
she should lock and cover up the trunk in its canvas case, and then pack her own box, if she
is to accompany her mistress.

2280. On reaching the house, the lady's-maid will be shown her lady's apartment; and her duties
here are what they were at home; she will arrange her mistress's things, and learn which is
her bell, in order to go to her when she rings. Her meals will be taken in the housekeeper's
room; and here she must be discreet and guarded in her talk to any one of her mistress or her
concerns. Her only occupation here will be attending in her lady's room, keeping her things
in order, and making her rooms comfortable for her.

2281. The evening duties of a lady's-maid are pretty nearly a repetition of those of the morning.
She is in attendance when her mistress retires; she assists her to undress if required, brushes
her hair, and renders such other assistance as is demanded; removes all slops; takes care that
the fire, if any, is safe, before she retires to rest herself.

2282. Ironing is a part of the duties of a lady's-maid, and she should be able to do it in
the most perfect manner when it becomes necessary. Ironing is often badly done from inattention
to a few very simple requirements. Cleanliness is the first essential: the ironing-board, the
fire, the iron, and the ironing-blanket should all be perfectly clean. It will not be necessary
here to enter into details on ironing, as full directions are given in the "Duties of the Laundry-maid."
A lady's-maid will have a great deal of "Ironing-out" to do; such as light evening dresses,
muslin dresses, &c., which are not dirty enough to be washed, but merely require smoothing
out to remove the creases. In summer, particularly, an iron will be constantly required, as
also a skirt-board, which should be covered with a nice clean piece of flannel. To keep muslin
dresses in order, they almost require smoothing out every time they are worn, particularly
if made with many flounces. The lady's-maid may often have to perform little services for her
mistress which require care; such as restoring the colour to scorched linen, &c. &c. The following
recipe is, we believe, a very good one.

To restore Whiteness to scorched Linen.

2283. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of vinegar, 2 oz. of fuller's-earth, 1 oz. of dried fowls' dung,
1/2 oz. of soap, the juice of 2 large onions.

Mode.--Boil all these ingredients together to the consistency of paste; spread the composition
thickly over the damaged part, and if the threads be not actually consumed, after it has been
allowed to dry on, and the place has subsequently been washed once or twice, every trace of
scorching will disappear.

    2284. Furs, Feathers, and Woollens require the constant care
    of the waiting-maid. Furs and feathers not in constant use
    should be wrapped up in linen washed in lye. From May to
    September they are subject to being made the depositary of the
    moth-eggs. They should be looked too, and shaken and beaten,
    from time to time, in case some of the eggs should have been
    lodged in them, in spite of every precaution; laying them up
    again, or rather folding them up as before, wrapping them in
    brown paper, which is itself a preservative. Shawls and cloaks,
    which would be damaged by such close folds, must be looked to,
    and aired and beaten, putting them away dry before the evening.

Preservatives against the Ravages of Moths.

2285. Place pieces of camphor, cedar-wood, Russia leather, tobacco-leaves, bog-myrtle, or anything
else strongly aromatic, in the drawers or boxes where furs or other things to be preserved
from moths are kept, and they will never take harm.

    2286. Jewels are generally wrapped up in cotton, and kept in
    their cases; but they are subject to tarnish from exposure to
    the air, and require cleaning. This is done by preparing clean
    soap-suds, using fine toilet-soap. Dip any article of gold,
    silver, gilt, or precious stones into this lye, and dry them by
    brushing with a brush of soft badgers' hair, or a fine sponge;
    afterwards with a piece of fine cloth, and, lastly, with a soft
    leather.

    2287. Epaulettes of gold or silver, and, in general, all
    articles of jewellery, may be dressed by dipping them in spirits
    of wine warmed in a bain marie, or shallow kettle, placed over
    a slow fire or hot-plate.

2288. The valet and lady's-maid, from their supposed influence with their master and mistress,
are exposed to some temptations to which other servants are less subjected. They are probably
in communication with the tradespeople who supply articles for the toilet; such as batters,
tailors, dressmakers, and perfumers. The conduct of waiting-maid and valet to these people
should be civil but independent, making reasonable allowance for want of exact punctuality,
if any such can be made: they should represent any inconvenience respectfully, and if an excuse
seems unreasonable, put the matter fairly to master or mistress, leaving it to them to notice
it further, if they think it necessary. No expectations of a personal character should influence
them one way or the other. It would be acting unreasonably to any domestic to make them refuse
such presents as tradespeople choose to give them; the utmost that can be expected is that
they should not influence their judgment in the articles supplied--that they should represent
them truly to master or mistress, without fear and without favour. Civility to all, servility
to none, is a good maxim for every one. Deference to a master and mistress, and to their friends
and visitors, is one of the implied terms of their engagement; and this deference must apply
even to what may be considered their whims. A servant is not to be seated, or wear a hat in
the house, in his master's or mistress's presence; nor offer any opinion, unless asked for
it; nor even to say "good night," or "good morning," except in reply to that salutation.

To preserve cut Flowers.

2289. A bouquet of freshly-cut flowers may be preserved alive for a long time by placing them
in a glass or vase with fresh water, in which a little charcoal has been steeped, or a small
piece of camphor dissolved. The vase should be set upon a plate or dish, and covered with a
bell-glass, around the edges of which, when it comes in contact with the plate, a little water
should be poured to exclude the air.

To revive cut Flowers after packing.

2290. Plunge the stems into boiling water, and by the time the water is cold, the flowers will
have revived. Then cut afresh the ends of the stems, and keep them in fresh cold water.

UPPER AND UNDER HOUSEMAIDS.

2291. Housemaids, in large establishments, have usually one or more assistants; in this case
they are upper and under housemaids. Dividing the work between them, the upper housemaid will
probably reserve for herself the task of dusting the ornaments and cleaning the furniture of
the principal apartments, but it is her duty to see that every department is properly attended
to. The number of assistants depends on the number in the family, as well as on the style in
which the establishment is kept up. In wealthy families it is not unusual for every grown-up
daughter to have her waiting-maid, whose duty it is to keep her mistress's apartments in order,
thus abridging the housemaid's duties. In others, perhaps, one waiting-maid attends on two
or three, when the housemaid's assistance will be more requisite. In fact, every establishment
has some customs peculiar to itself, on which we need not dwell; the general duties are the
same in all, perfect cleanliness and order being the object.

DUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID.

2292. "Cleanliness is next to godliness," saith the proverb, and "order" is in the next degree;
the housemaid, then, may be said to be the handmaiden to two of the most prominent virtues.
Her duties are very numerous, and many of the comforts of the family depend on their performance;
but they are simple and easy to a person naturally clean and orderly, and desirous of giving
satisfaction. In all families, whatever the habits of the master and mistress, servants will
find it advantageous to rise early; their daily work will thus come easy to them. If they rise
late, there is a struggle to overtake it, which throws an air of haste and hurry over the whole
establishment. Where the master's time is regulated by early business or professional engagements,
this will, of course, regulate the hours of the servants; but even where that is not the case,
servants will find great personal convenience in rising early and getting through their work
in an orderly and methodical manner. The housemaid who studies her own ease will certainly
be at her work by six o'clock in the summer, and, probably, half-past six or seven in the winter
months, having spent a reasonable time in her own chamber in dressing. Earlier than this would,
probably, be an unnecessary waste of coals and candle in winter.

2293. The first duty of the housemaid in winter is to open the shutters of all the lower rooms
in the house, and take up the hearth-rugs of those rooms which she is going to "do" before
breakfast. In some families, where there is only a cook and housemaid kept, and where the drawing-rooms
are large, the cook has the care of the dining-room, and the housemaid that of the breakfast-room,
library, and drawing-rooms. After the shutters are all opened, she sweeps the breakfast-room,
sweeping the dust towards the fire-place, of course previously removing the fonder. She should
then lay a cloth (generally made of coarse wrappering) over the carpet in front of the stove,
and on this should place her housemaid's box, containing black-lead brushes, leathers, emery-paper,
cloth, black lead, and all utensils necessary for cleaning a grate, with the cinder-pail on
the other side.

2294. She now sweeps up the ashes, and deposits them in her cinder-pail, which is a japanned
tin pail, with a wire-sifter inside, and a closely-fitting top. In this pail the cinders are
sifted, and reserved for use in the kitchen or under the copper, the ashes only being thrown
away. The cinders disposed of, she proceeds to black-lead the grate, producing the black lead,
the soft brush for laying it on, her blacking and polishing brushes, from the box which contains
her tools. This housemaid's box should be kept well stocked. Having blackened, brushed, and
polished every part, and made all clean and bright, she now proceeds to lay the fire. Sometimes
it is very difficult to get a proper polish to black grates, particularly if they have been
neglected, and allowed to rust at all. Brunswick black, which is an excellent varnish for grates,
may be prepared in the following manner:--

2295. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of common asphaltum, 1/2 pint of linseed oil, 1 quart of oil of turpentine.

Mode.--Melt the asphaltum, and add gradually to it the other two ingredients. Apply this with
a small painter's brush, and leave it to become perfectly dry. The grate will need no other
cleaning, but will merely require dusting every day, and occasionally brushing with a dry black-lead
brush. This is, of course, when no fires are used. When they are required, the bars, cheeks,
and back of the grate will need black-leading in the usual manner.

    2296. Fire-lighting, however simple, is an operation requiring
    some skill; a fire is readily made by laying a few cinders at
    the bottom in open order; over this a few pieces of paper, and
    over that again eight or ten pieces of dry wood; over the wood,
    a course of moderate-sized pieces of coal, taking care to leave
    hollow spaces between for air at the centre; and taking care to
    lay the whole well back in the grate, so that the smoke may go
    up the chimney, and not into the room. This done, fire the paper
    with a match from below, and, if properly laid, it will soon
    burn up; the stream of flame from the wood and paper soon
    communicating to the coals and cinders, provided there is plenty
    of air at the centre.

    2297. A new method of lighting a fire is sometimes practised
    with advantage, the fire lighting from the top and burning down,
    in place of being lighted and burning up from below. This is
    arranged by laying the coals at the bottom, mixed with a few
    good-sized cinders, and the wood at the top, with another layer
    of coals and some paper over it; the paper is lighted in the
    usual way, and soon burns down to a good fire, with some economy
    of fuel, as is said.

2298. Bright grates require unceasing attention to keep them in perfect order. A day should
never pass without the housemaid rubbing with a dry leather the polished parts of a grate,
as also the fender and fire-irons. A careful and attentive housemaid should have no occasion
ever to use emery-paper for any part but the bars, which, of course, become blackened by the
fire. (Some mistresses, to save labour, have a double set of bars, one set bright for the summer,
and another black set to use when fires are in requisition.) When bright grates are once neglected,
small rust-spots begin to show themselves, which a plain leather will not remove; the following
method of cleaning them must then be resorted to:--First, thoroughly clean with emery-paper;
then take a large smooth pebble from the road, sufficiently large to hold comfortably in the
hand, with which rub the steel backwards and forwards one way, until the desired polish is
obtained. It may appear at first to scratch, but continue rubbing, and the result will be success.
The following is also an excellent polish for bright stoves and steel articles:--

2299. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of turpentine, 1 ditto of sweet oil, emery powder.

Mode.--Mix the turpentine and sweet oil together, stirring in sufficient emery powder to make
the mixture of the thickness of cream. Put it on the article with a piece of soft flannel,
rub off quickly with another piece, then polish with a little dry emery powder and clean leather.

2300. The several fires lighted, the housemaid proceeds with her dusting, and polishing the
several pieces of furniture in the breakfast-parlour, leaving no corner unvisited. Before sweeping
the carpet, it is a good practice to sprinkle it all over with tea-leaves, which not only lay
all dust, but give a slightly fragrant smell to the room. It is now in order for the reception
of the family; and where there is neither footman nor parlour-maid, she now proceeds to the
dressing-room, and lights her mistress's fire, if she is in the habit of having one to dress
by. Her mistress is called, hot water placed in the dressing-room for her use, her clothes--as
far as they are under the house-maid's charge--put before the fire to air, hanging a fire-guard
on the bars where there is one, while she proceeds to prepare the breakfast.

2301. In summer the housemaid's work is considerably abridged: she throws open the windows
of the several rooms not occupied as bedrooms, that they may receive the fresh morning air
before they are occupied; she prepares the breakfast-room by sweeping the carpet, rubbing tables
and chairs, dusting mantel-shelf and picture-frames with a light brush, dusting the furniture,
and beating and sweeping the rug; she cleans the grate when necessary, and replaces the white
paper or arranges the shavings with which it is filled, leaving everything clean and tidy for
breakfast. It is not enough, however, in cleaning furniture, just to pass lightly over the
surface; the rims and legs of tables, and the backs and legs of chairs and sofas, should be
rubbed vigorously daily; if there is a book-case, every corner of every pane and ledge requires
to be carefully wiped, so that not a speck of dust can be found in the room.

2302. After the breakfast-room is finished, the housemaid should proceed to sweep down the
stairs, commencing at the top, whilst the cook has the charge of the hall, door-step, and passages.
After this she should go into the drawing-room, cover up every article of furniture that is
likely to spoil, with large dusting-sheets, and put the chairs together, by turning them seat
to seat, and, in fact, make as much room as possible, by placing all the loose furniture in
the middle of the room, whilst she sweeps the corners and sides. When this is accomplished,
the furniture can then be put back in its place, and the middle of the room swept, sweeping
the dirt, as before said, towards the fireplace. The same rules should be observed in cleaning
the drawing-room grates as we have just stated, putting down the cloth, before commencing,
to prevent the carpet from getting soiled. In the country, a room would not require sweeping
thoroughly like this more than twice a week; but the housemaid should go over it every morning
with a dust-pan and broom, taking up every crumb and piece she may see. After the sweeping
she should leave the room, shut the door, and proceed to lay the breakfast. Where there is
neither footman nor parlour-maid kept, the duty of laying the breakfast-cloth rests on the
housemaid.

2303. Before laying the cloth for breakfast, the heater of the tea-urn is to be placed in the
hottest part of the kitchen fire; or, where the kettle is used, boiled on the kitchen fire,
and then removed to the parlour, where it is kept hot. Having washed herself free from the
dust arising from the morning's work, the housemaid collects the breakfast-things on her tray,
takes the breakfast-cloth from the napkin press, and carries them all on the tray into the
parlour; arranges them on the table, placing a sufficiency of knives, forks, and salt-cellars
for the family, and takes the tray back to the pantry; gets a supply of milk, cream, and bread;
fills the butter-dish, taking care that the salt is plentiful, and soft and dry, and that hot
plates and egg-cups are ready where warm meat or eggs are served, and that butter-knife and
bread-knife are in their places. And now she should give the signal for breakfast, holding
herself ready to fill the urn with hot water, or hand the kettle, and take in the rolls, toast,
and other eatables, with which the cook supplies her, when the breakfast-room bell rings; bearing
in mind that she is never to enter the parlour with dirty hands or with a dirty apron, and
that everything is to be handed on a tray; that she is to hand everything she may be required
to supply, on the left hand of the person she is serving, and that all is done quietly and
without bustle or hurry. In some families, where there is a large number to attend on, the
cook waits at breakfast whilst the housemaid is busy upstairs in the bedrooms, or sweeping,
dusting, and putting the drawing-room in order.

2304. Breakfast served, the housemaid proceeds to the bed-chambers, throws up the sashes, if
not already done, pulls up the blinds, throwing back curtains at the same time, and opens the
beds, by removing the clothes, placing them over a horse, or, failing that, over the backs
of chairs. She now proceeds to empty the slops. In doing this, everything is emptied into the
slop-pail, leaving a little scalding-hot water for a minute in such vessels as require it;
adding a drop of turpentine to the water, when that is not sufficient to cleanse them. The
basin is emptied, well rinsed with clean water, and carefully wiped; the ewers emptied and
washed; finally, the water-jugs themselves emptied out and rinsed, and wiped dry. As soon as
this is done, she should remove and empty the pails, taking care that they also are well washed,
scalded, and wiped as soon as they are empty.

2305. Next follows bedmaking, at which the cook or kitchen-maid, where one is kept, usually
assists; but, before beginning, velvet chairs, or other things injured by dust, should be removed
to another room. In bedmaking, the fancy of its occupant should be consulted; some like beds
sloping from the top towards the feet, swelling slightly in the middle; others, perfectly flat:
a good housemaid will accommodate each bed to the taste of the sleeper, taking care to shake,
beat, and turn it well in the process. Some persons prefer sleeping on the mattress; in which
case a feather bed is usually beneath, resting on a second mattress, and a straw paillasse
at the bottom. In this case, the mattresses should change places daily; the feather bed placed
on the mattress shaken, beaten, taken up and opened several times, so as thoroughly to separate
the feathers: if too large to be thus handled, the maid should shake and beat one end first,
and then the other, smoothing it afterwards equally all over into the required shape, and place
the mattress gently over it. Any feathers which escape in this process a tidy servant will
put back through the seam of the tick; she will also be careful to sew up any stitch that gives
way the moment it is discovered. The bedclothes are laid on, beginning with an under blanket
and sheet, which are tucked under the mattress at the bottom. The bolster is then beaten and
shaken, and put on, the top of the sheet rolled round it, and the sheet tucked in all round.
The pillows and other bedclothes follow, and the counterpane over all, which should fall in
graceful folds, and at equal distance from the ground all round. The curtains are drawn to
the head and folded neatly across the bed, and the whole finished in a smooth and graceful
manner. Where spring-mattresses are used, care should be taken that the top one is turned every
day. The housemaid should now take up in a dustpan any pieces that may be on the carpet; she
should dust the room, shut the door, and proceed to another room. When all the bedrooms are
finished, she should dust the stairs, and polish the handrail of the banisters, and see that
all ledges, window-sills, &c., are quite free from dust. It will be necessary for the housemaid
to divide her work, so that she may not have too much to do on certain days, and not sufficient
to fill up her time on other days. In the country, bedrooms should be swept and thoroughly
cleaned once a week; and to be methodical and regular in her work, the housemaid should have
certain days for doing certain rooms thoroughly. For instance, the drawing-room on Monday,
two bedrooms on Tuesday, two on Wednesday, and so on, reserving a day for thoroughly cleaning
the plate, bedroom candlesticks, &c. &c., which she will have to do where there is no parlour-maid
or footman kept. By this means the work will be divided, and there will be no unnecessary bustling
and hurrying, as is the case where the work is done any time, without rule or regulation.

2306. Once a week, when a bedroom is to be thoroughly cleaned, the house-maid should commence
by brushing the mattresses of the bed before it is made; she should then make it, shake the
curtains, lay them smoothly on the bed, and pin or tuck up the bottom valance, so that she
may be able to sweep under the bed. She should then unloop the window-curtains, shake them,
and pin them high up out of the way. After clearing the dressing-table, and the room altogether
of little articles of china, &c. &c., she should shake the toilet-covers, fold them up, and
lay them on the bed, over which a large dusting-sheet should be thrown. She should then sweep
the room; first of all sprinkling the carpet with well-squeezed tea-leaves, or a little freshly-pulled
grass, when this is obtainable. After the carpet is swept, and the grate cleaned, she should
wash with soap and water, with a little soda in it, the washing-table apparatus, removing all
marks or fur round the jugs, caused by the water. The water-bottles and tumblers must also
have her attention, as well as the top of the washing-stand, which should be cleaned with soap
and flannel if it be marble: if of polished mahogany, no soap must be used. When these are
all clean and arranged in their places, the housemaid should scrub the floor where it is not
covered with carpet, under the beds, and round the wainscot. She should use as little soap
and soda as possible, as too free a use of these articles is liable to give the boards a black
appearance. In the country, cold soft water, a clean scrubbing-brush, and a willing arm, are
all that are required to make bedroom floors look white. In winter it is not advisable to scrub
rooms too often, as it is difficult to dry them thoroughly at that season of the year, and
nothing is more dangerous than to allow persons to sleep in a damp room. The housemaid should
now dust the furniture, blinds, ornaments, &c.; polish the looking-glass; arrange the toilet-cover
and muslin; remove the cover from the bed, and straighten and arrange the curtains and counterpane.
A bedroom should be cleaned like this every week. There are times, however, when it is necessary
to have the carpet up; this should be done once a year in the country, and twice a year in
large cities. The best time for these arrangements is spring and autumn, when the bed-furniture
requires changing to suit the seasons of the year. After arranging the furniture, it should
all be well rubbed and polished; and for this purpose the housemaid should provide herself
with an old silk pocket-handkerchief, to finish the polishing.

2307. As modern furniture is now nearly always French-polished, it should often be rubbed with
an old silk rubber, or a fine cloth or duster, to keep it free from smears. Three or four times
a year any of the following polishes may be applied with very great success, as any of them
make French-polished furniture look very well. One precaution must be taken,--not to put too
much of the polish on at one time, and to rub, not smear it over the articles.

FURNITURE POLISH.

2308. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of linseed-oil, 1/4 pint of vinegar, 1 oz. of spirits of salts,
1/2 oz. of muriatic antimony.

Mode.--Mix all well together, and shake before using.

FURNITURE POLISH.

2309. INGREDIENTS.--Equal proportions of linseed-oil, turpentine, vinegar, and spirits of wine.

Mode.--When used, shake the mixture well, and rub on the furniture with a piece of linen rag,
and polish with a clean duster. Vinegar and oil, rubbed in with flannel, and the furniture
rubbed with a clean duster, produce a very good polish.

FURNITURE PASTE.

2310. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of common beeswax, 1 oz. of white wax, 1 oz. of curd soap, 1 pint
of turpentine, 1 pint of boiled water.

Mode.--Mix the ingredients together, adding the water when cold; shake the mixture frequently
in the bottle, and do not use it for 48 hours after it is made. It should be applied with a
piece of flannel, the furniture polished with a duster, and then with an old silk rubber.

2311. The chambers are finished, the chamber candlesticks brought down and cleaned, the parlour
lamps trimmed;--and here the housemaid's utmost care is required. In cleaning candlesticks,
as in every other cleaning, she should have cloths and brushes kept for that purpose alone;
the knife used to scrape them should be applied to no other purpose; the tallow-grease should
be thrown into a box kept for the purpose; the same with everything connected with the lamp-trimming;
the best mode of doing which she will do well to learn from the tradesman who supplies the
oil; always bearing in mind, however, that without perfect cleanliness, which involves occasional
scalding, no lamp can be kept in order.

2312. The drawing and dining-room, inasmuch as everything there is more costly and valuable,
require even more care. When the carpets are of the kind known as velvet-pile, they require
to be swept firmly by a hard whisk brush, made of cocoanut fibre.

2313. The furniture must be carefully gone over in every corner with a soft cloth, that it
may be left perfectly free from dust; or where that is beyond reach, with a brush made of long
feathers, or a goose's wing. The sofas are swept in the same manner, slightly beaten, the cushions
shaken and smoothed, the picture-frames swept, and everything arranged in its proper place.
This, of course, applies to dining as well as drawing-room and morning-room. And now the housemaid
may dress herself for the day, and prepare for the family dinner, at which she must attend.

2314. We need not repeat the long instructions already given for laying the dinner-table. At
the family dinner, even where no footman waits, the routine will be the same. In most families
the cloth is laid with the slips on each side, with napkins, knives, forks, spoons, and wine
and finger glasses on all occasions.

2315. She should ascertain that her plate is in order, glasses free from smears, water-bottles
and decanters the same, and everything ready on her tray, that she may be able to lay her cloth
properly. Few things add more to the neat and comfortable appearance of a dinner-table than
well-polished plate; indeed, the state of the plate is a certain indication of a well-managed
or ill-managed household. Nothing is easier than to keep plate in good order, and yet many
servants, from stupidity and ignorance, make it the greatest trouble of all things under their
care. It should be remembered, that it is utterly impossible to make greasy silver take a polish;
and that as spoons and forks in daily use are continually in contact with grease, they must
require good washing in soap-and-water to remove it. Silver should be washed with a soapy flannel
in one water, rinsed in another, and then wiped dry with a dry cloth. The plate so washed may
be polished with the plate-rags, as in the following directions:--Once a week all the plate
should receive a thorough cleaning with the hartshorn powder, as directed in the first recipe
for cleaning plate; and where the housemaid can find time, rubbed every day with the plate-rags.

    2316. Hartshorn, we may observe, is one of the best possible
    ingredients for plate-powder in daily use. It leaves on the
    silver a deep, dark polish, and at the same time does less
    injury than anything else. It has also the advantage of being
    very cheap; almost all the ordinary powders sold in boxes
    containing more or less of quicksilver, in some form or another;
    and this in process of time is sure to make the plate brittle.
    If any one wishes to be convinced of the effect of quicksilver
    on plate, he has only to rub a little of it on one place for
    some time,--on the handle of a silver teaspoon for instance, and
    he will find it break in that spot with very little pressure.

To Clean Plate.

A very excellent method.

2317. Wash the plate well to remove all grease, in a strong lather of common yellow soap and
boiling water, and wipe it quite dry; then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be required,
into a thick paste, with cold water or spirits of wine; smear this lightly over the plate with
a piece of soft rag, and leave it for some little time to dry. When perfectly dry, brush it
off quite clean with a soft plate-brush, and polish the plate with a dry leather. If the plate
be very dirty, or much tarnished, spirits of wine will be found to answer better than the water
for mixing the paste.

Plate-rags for daily use.

2318. Boil soft rags (nothing is better for the purpose than the tops of old cotton stockings)
in a mixture of new milk and hartshorn powder, in the proportion of 1 oz. of powder to a pint
of milk; boil them for 5 minutes; wring them as soon as they are taken out, for a moment, in
cold water, and dry them before the fire. With these rags rub the plate briskly as soon as
it has been well washed and dried after daily use. A most beautiful deep polish will be produced,
and the plate will require nothing more than merely to be dusted with a leather or a dry soft
cloth, before it is again put on the table.

2319. For waiting at table, the housemaid should be neatly and cleanly dressed, and, if possible,
her dress made with closed sleeves, the large open ones dipping and falling into everything
on the table, and being very much in the way. She should not wear creaking boots, and should
move about the room as noiselessly as possible, anticipating people's wants by handing them
things without being asked for them, and altogether be as quiet as possible. It will be needless
here to repeat what we have already said respecting waiting at table, in the duties of the
butler and footman: rules that are good to be observed by them, are equally good for the parlour-maid
or housemaid.

2320. The housemaid having announced that dinner is on the table, will hand the soup, fish,
meat, or side-dishes to the different members of the family; but in families who do not spend
much of the day together, they will probably prefer being alone at dinner and breakfast; the
housemaid will be required, after all are helped, if her master does not wish her to stay in
the room, to go on with her work of cleaning up in the pantry, and answer the bell when rung.
In this case she will place a pile of plates on the table or a dumbwaiter, within reach of
her master and mistress, and leave the room.

.

2321. Dinner over, the housemaid removes the plates and dishes on the tray, places the dirty
knives and forks in the basket prepared for them, folds up the napkins in the ring which indicates
by which member of the family it has been used, brushes off the crumbs on the hand-tray kept
for the purpose, folds up the table-cloth in the folds already made, and places it in the linen-press
to be smoothed out. After every meal the table should be rubbed, all marks from hot plates
removed, and the table-cover thrown over, and the room restored to its usual order. If the
family retire to the drawing-room, or any other room, it is a good practice to throw up the
sash to admit fresh air and ventilate the room.

2322. The housemaid's evening service consists in washing up the dinner-things, the plate,
plated articles, and glasses, restoring everything to its place; cleaning up her pantry, and
putting away everything for use when next required; lastly, preparing for tea, as the time
approaches, by setting the things out on the tray, getting the urn or kettle ready, with cream
and other things usually partaken of at that meal.

2323. In summer-time the windows of all the bedrooms, which have been closed during the heat
of the day, should be thrown open for an hour or so after sunset, in order to air them. Before
dark they should be closed, the bedclothes turned down, and the night-clothes laid in order
for use when required. During winter, where fires are required in the dressing-rooms, they
should be lighted an hour before the usual time of retiring, placing a fire-guard before each
fire. At the same time, the night-things on the horse should be placed before it to be aired,
with a tin can of hot water, if the mistress is in the habit of washing before going to bed.
We may add, that there is no greater preservative of beauty than washing the face every night
in hot water. The housemaid will probably be required to assist her mistress to undress and
put her dress in order for the morrow; in which case her duties are very much those of the
lady's-maid.

2324. And now the fire is made up for the night, the fireguard replaced, and everything in
the room in order for the night, the housemaid taking care to leave the night-candle and matches
together in a convenient place, should they be required. It is usual in summer to remove all
highly fragrant flowers from sleeping-rooms, the impression being that their scent is injurious
in a close chamber.

2325. On leisure days, the housemaid should be able to do some needlework for her mistress,--such
as turning and mending sheets and darning the house linen, or assist her in anything she may
think fit to give her to do. For this reason it is almost essential that a housemaid, in a
small family, should be an expert needlewoman; as, if she be a good manager and an active girl,
she will have time on her hands to get through plenty of work.

2326. Periodical Cleanings.--Besides the daily routine which we have described, there are portions
of every house which can only be thoroughly cleaned occasionally; at which time the whole house
usually undergoes a more thorough cleaning than is permitted in the general way. On these occasions
it is usual to begin at the top of the house and clean downwards; moving everything out of
the room; washing the wainscoting or paint with soft soap and water; pulling down the beds
and thoroughly cleansing all the joints; "scrubbing" the floor; beating feather beds, mattress,
and paillasse, and thoroughly purifying every article of furniture before it is put back in
its place.

2327. This general cleaning usually takes place in the spring or early summer, when the warm
curtains of winter are replaced by the light and cheerful muslin curtains. Carpets are at the
same time taken up and beaten, except where the mistress of the house has been worried into
an experiment by the often-reiterated question, "Why beat your carpets?" In this case she will
probably have made up her mind to try the cleaning process, and arranged with the company to
send for them on the morning when cleaning commenced. It is hardly necessary to repeat, that
on this occasion every article is to be gone over, the French-polished furniture well rubbed
and polished. The same thorough system of cleaning should be done throughout the house; the
walls cleaned where painted, and swept down with a soft broom or feather brush where papered;
the window and bed curtains, which have been replaced with muslin ones, carefully brushed,
or, if they require it, cleaned; lamps not likely to be required, washed out with hot water,
dried, and cleaned. The several grates are now to be furnished with their summer ornaments;
and we know none prettier than the following, which the housemaid may provide at a small expense
to her mistress:--Purchase two yards and a half of crinoline muslin, and tear it into small
strips, the selvage way of the material, about an inch wide; strip this thread by thread on
each side, leaving the four centre threads; this gives about six-and-thirty pieces, fringed
on each side, which are tied together at one end, and fastened to the trap of the register,
while the threads, unravelled, are spread gracefully about the grate, the lower part of which
is filled with paper shavings. This makes a very elegant and very cheap ornament, which is
much stronger, besides, than those usually purchased.

2328. As winter approaches, this house-cleaning will have to be repeated, and the warm bed
and window curtains replaced. The process of scouring and cleaning is again necessary, and
must be gone through, beginning at the top, and going through the house, down to the kitchens.

2329. Independently of these daily and periodical cleanings, other occupations will present
themselves from time to time, which the housemaid will have to perform. When spots show on
polished furniture, they can generally be restored by soap-and-water and a sponge, the polish
being brought out by using a little polish, and then well rubbing it. Again, drawers which
draw out stiffly may be made to move more easily if the spot where they press is rubbed over
with a little soap.

2330. Chips broken off any of the furniture should be collected and replaced, by means of a
little glue applied to it. Liquid glue, which is sold prepared in bottles, is very useful to
have in the house, as it requires no melting; and anything broken can be so quickly repaired.

2331. Breaking glass and china is about the most disagreeable thing that can happen in a family,
and it is, probably, a greater annoyance to a right-minded servant than to the mistress. A
neat-handed housemaid may sometimes repair these breakages, where they are not broken in very
conspicuous places, by joining the pieces very neatly together with a cement made as follows:--Dissolve
an ounce of gum mastic in a quantity of highly-rectified spirits of wine; then soften an ounce
of isinglass in warm water, and, finally, dissolve it in rum or brandy, till it forms a thick
jelly. Mix the isinglass and gum mastic together, adding a quarter of an ounce of finely-powdered
gum ammoniac; put the whole into an earthen pipkin, and in a warm place, till they are thoroughly
incorporated together; pour it into a small phial, and cork it down for use.

2332. In using it, dissolve a small piece of the cement in a silver teaspoon over a lighted
candle. The broken pieces of glass or china being warmed, and touched with the now liquid cement,
join the parts neatly together, and hold in their places till the cement has set; then wipe
away the cement adhering to the edge of the joint, and leave it for twelve hours without touching
it: the joint will be as strong as the china itself, and if neatly done, it will show no joining.
It is essential that neither of the pieces be wetted either with hot or cold water.

USEFUL RECIPES FOR HOUSEMAIDS.

To clean Marble.

2333. Mix with 1/4 pint of soap lees, 1/2 gill of turpentine, sufficient pipe-clay and bullock's
gall to make the whole into rather a thick paste. Apply it to the marble with a soft brush,
and after a day or two, when quite dry, rub it off with a soft rag. Apply this a second or
third time till the marble is quite clean.

Another method.

2334. Take two parts of soda, one of pumice-stone, and one of finely-powdered chalk. Sift these
through a fine sieve, and mix them into a paste with water. Rub this well all over the marble,
and the stains will be removed; then wash it with soap-and-water, and a beautiful bright polish
will be produced.

To clean Floorcloth.

2335. After having washed the floorcloth in the usual manner with a damp flannel, wet it all
over with milk and rub it well with a dry cloth, when a most beautiful polish will be brought
out. Some persons use for rubbing a well-waxed flannel; but this in general produces an unpleasant
slipperiness, which is not the case with the milk.

To clean Decanters.

2336. Roll up in small pieces some soft brown or blotting paper; wet them, and soap them well.
Put them into the decanters about one quarter full of warm water; shake them well for a few
minutes, then rinse with clear cold water; wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth, put the
decanters to drain, and when dry they will be almost as bright as new ones.

To brighten Gilt Frames.

2337. Take sufficient flour of sulphur to give a golden tinge to about 1-1/2 pint of water,
and in this boil 4 or 5 bruised onions, or garlic, which will answer the same purpose. Strain
off the liquid, and with it, when cold, wash, with a soft brush, any gilding which requires
restoring, and when dry it will come out as bright as new work.

To preserve bright Grates or Fire-irons from Rust.

2338. Make a strong paste of fresh lime and water, and with a fine brush smear it as thickly
as possible over all the polished surface requiring preservation. By this simple means, all
the grates and fire-irons in an empty house may be kept for months free from harm, without
further care or attention.

German Furniture-Gloss.

2339. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. yellow wax, 1 oz. black rosin, 2 oz. of oil of turpentine.

Mode.--Cut the wax into small pieces, and melt it in a pipkin, with the rosin pounded very
fine. Stir in gradually, while these two ingredients are quite warm, the oil of turpentine.
Keep this composition well covered for use in a tin or earthen pot. A little of this gloss
should be spread on a piece of coarse woollen cloth, and the furniture well rubbed with it;
afterwards it should be polished with a fine cloth.

DUTIES OF THE MAID-OF-ALL-WORK.

2340. The general servant, or maid-of-all-work, is perhaps the only one of her class deserving
of commiseration: her life is a solitary one, and in, some places, her work is never done.
She is also subject to rougher treatment than either the house or kitchen-maid, especially
in her earlier career: she starts in life, probably a girl of thirteen, with some small tradesman's
wife as her mistress, just a step above her in the social scale; and although the class contains
among them many excellent, kind-hearted women, it also contains some very rough specimens of
the feminine gender, and to some of these it occasionally falls to give our maid-of-all-work
her first lessons in her multifarious occupations: the mistress's commands are the measure
of the maid-of-all-work's duties. By the time she has become a tolerable servant, she is probably
engaged in some respectable tradesman's house, where she has to rise with the lark, for she
has to do in her own person all the work which in larger establishments is performed by cook,
kitchen-maid, and housemaid, and occasionally the part of a footman's duty, which consists
in carrying messages.

2341. The general servant's duties commence by opening the shutters (and windows, if the weather
permits) of all the lower apartments in the house; she should then brush up her kitchen-range,
light the fire, clear away the ashes, clean the hearth, and polish with a leather the bright
parts of the range, doing all as rapidly and as vigorously as possible, that no more time be
wasted than is necessary. After putting on the kettle, she should then proceed to the dining-room
or parlour to get it in order for breakfast. She should first roll up the rug, take up the
fender, shake and fold up the table-cloth, then sweep the room, carrying the dirt towards the
fireplace; a coarse cloth should then be laid down over the carpet, and she should proceed
to clean the grate, having all her utensils close to her. When the grate is finished, the ashes
cleared away, the hearth cleaned, and the fender put back in its place, she must dust the furniture,
not omitting the legs of the tables and chairs; and if there are any ornaments or things on
the sideboard, she must not dust round them, but lift them up on to another place, dust well
where they have been standing, and then replace the things. Nothing annoys a particular mistress
so much as to find, when she comes down stairs, different articles of furniture looking as
if they had never been dusted. If the servant is at all methodical, and gets into a habit of
doing a room in a certain way, she will scarcely ever leave her duties neglected. After the
rug is put down, the table-cloth arranged, and everything in order, she should lay the cloth
for breakfast, and then shut the dining-room door.

2342. The hall must now be swept, the mats shaken, the door-step cleaned, and any brass knockers
or handles polished up with the leather. If the family breakfast very early, the tidying of
the hall must then be deferred till after that meal. After cleaning the boots that are absolutely
required, the servant should now wash her hands and face, put on a clean white apron, and be
ready for her mistress when she comes down stairs. In families where there is much work to
do before breakfast, the master of the house frequently has two pairs of boots in wear, so
that they may be properly cleaned when the servant has more time to do them, in the daytime.
This arrangement is, perhaps, scarcely necessary in the summer-time, when there are no grates
to clean every morning; but in the dark days of winter it is only kind and thoughtful to lighten
a servant-of-all-work's duties as much as possible.

2343. She will now carry the urn into the dining-room, where her mistress will make the tea
or coffee, and sometimes will boil the eggs, to insure them being done to her liking. In the
mean time the servant cooks, if required, the bacon, kidneys, fish, &c.;--if cold meat is to
be served, she must always send it to table on a clean dish, and nicely garnished with tufts
of parsley, if this is obtainable.

2344. After she has had her own breakfast, and whilst the family are finishing theirs, she
should go upstairs into the bedrooms, open all the windows, strip the clothes off the beds,
and leave them to air whilst she is clearing away the breakfast things. She should then take
up the crumbs in a dustpan from under the table, put the chairs in their places, and sweep
up the hearth.

2345. The breakfast things washed up, the kitchen should be tidied, so that it may be neat
when her mistress comes in to give the orders for the day: after receiving these orders, the
servant should go upstairs again, with a jug of boiling water, the slop-pail, and two cloths.
After emptying the slops, and scalding the vessels with the boiling water, and wiping them
thoroughly dry, she should wipe the top of the wash-table and arrange it all in order. She
then proceeds to make the beds, in which occupation she is generally assisted by the mistress,
or, if she have any daughters, by one of them. Before commencing to make the bed, the servant
should put on a large bed-apron, kept for this purpose only, which should be made very wide,
to button round the waist and meet behind, while it should be made as long as the dress. By
adopting this plan, the blacks and dirt on servants' dresses (which at all times it is impossible
to help) will not rub off on to the bed-clothes, mattresses, and bed furniture. When the beds
are made, the rooms should be dusted, the stairs lightly swept down, hall furniture, closets,
&c., dusted. The lady of the house, where there is but one servant kept, frequently takes charge
of the drawing-room herself, that is to say, dusting it; the servant sweeping, cleaning windows,
looking-glasses, grates, and rough work of that sort. If there are many ornaments and knick-knacks
about the room, it is certainly better for the mistress to dust these herself, as a maid-of-all-work's
hands are not always in a condition to handle delicate ornaments.

2346. Now she has gone the rounds of the house and seen that all is in order, the servant goes
to her kitchen to see about the cooking of the dinner, in which very often her mistress will
assist her. She should put on a coarse apron with a bib to do her dirty work in, which may
be easily replaced by a white one if required.

2347. Half an hour before dinner is ready, she should lay the cloth, that everything may be
in readiness when she is dishing up the dinner, and take all into the dining-room that is likely
to be required, in the way of knives, forks, spoons, bread, salt, water, &c. &c. By exercising
a little forethought, much confusion and trouble may be saved both to mistress and servant,
by getting everything ready for the dinner in good time.

2348. After taking in the dinner, when every one is seated, she removes the covers, hands the
plates round, and pours out the beer; and should be careful to hand everything on the left
side of the person she is waiting on.

2349. We need scarcely say that a maid-of-all-work cannot stay in the dining-room during the
whole of dinner-time, as she must dish up her pudding, or whatever is served after the first
course. When she sees every one helped, she should leave the room to make her preparations
for the next course; and anything that is required, such as bread, &c., people may assist themselves
to in the absence of the servant.

2350. When the dinner things are cleared away, the servant should sweep up the crumbs in the
dining-room, sweep the hearth, and lightly dust the furniture, then sit down to her own dinner.

2351. After this, she washes up and puts away the dinner things, sweeps the kitchen, dusts
and tidies it, and puts on the kettle for tea. She should now, before dressing herself for
the afternoon, clean her knives, boots, and shoes, and do any other dirty work in the scullery
that may be necessary. Knife-cleaning machines are rapidly taking the place, in most households,
of the old knife-board. The saving of labour by the knife-cleaner is very great, and its performance
of the work is very satisfactory. Small and large machines are manufactured, some cleaning
only four knives, whilst others clean as many as twelve at once. Nothing can be more simple
than the process of machine knife-cleaning; and although, in a very limited household, the
substitution of the machine for the board may not be necessary, yet we should advise all housekeepers,
to whom the outlay is not a difficulty, to avail themselves of the services of a machine. We
have already spoken of its management in the "Duties of the Footman," No. 2177.

2352. When the servant is dressed, she takes in the tea, and after tea turns down the beds,
sees that the water-jugs and bottles are full, closes the windows, and draws down the blinds.
If the weather is very warm, these are usually left open until the last thing at night, to
cool the rooms.

2353. The routine of a general servant's duties depends upon the kind of situation she occupies;
but a systematic maid-of-all-work should so contrive to divide her work, that every day in
the week may have its proper share. By this means she is able to keep the house clean with
less fatigue to herself than if she left all the cleaning to do at the end of the week. Supposing
there are five bedrooms in the house, two sitting-rooms, kitchen, scullery, and the usual domestic
offices:--on Monday she should thoroughly clean the drawing-room; on Tuesday, two of the bedrooms;
on Wednesday, two more; on Thursday, the other bedroom and stairs; on Friday morning she should
sweep the dining-room very thoroughly, clean the hall, and in the afternoon her kitchen tins
and bright utensils. By arranging her work in this manner, no undue proportion will fall to
Saturday's share, and she will then have this day for cleaning plate, cleaning her kitchen,
and arranging everything in nice order. The regular work must, of course, be performed in the
usual manner, as we have endeavoured to describe.

2354. Before retiring to bed, she will do well to clean up glasses, plates, &c. which have
been used for the evening meal, and prepare for her morning's work by placing her wood near
the fire, on the hob, to dry, taking care there is no danger of it igniting, before she leaves
the kitchen for the night. Before retiring, she will have to lock and bolt the doors, unless
the master undertakes this office himself.

2355. If the washing, or even a portion of it, is done at home, it will be impossible for the
maid-of-all-work to do her household duties thoroughly, during the time it is about, unless
she have some assistance. Usually, if all the washing is done at home, the mistress hires some
one to assist at the wash-tub, and sees to little matters herself, in the way of dusting, clearing
away breakfast things, folding, starching, and ironing the fine things. With a little management
much can be accomplished, provided the mistress be industrious, energetic, and willing to lend
a helping hand. Let washing-week be not the excuse for having everything in a muddle; and although
"things" cannot be cleaned so thoroughly, and so much time spent upon them, as ordinarily,
yet the house may be kept tidy and clear from litter without a great deal of exertion either
on the part of the mistress or servant. We will conclude our remarks with an extract from an
admirably-written book, called "Home Truths for Home Peace." The authoress says, with respect
to the great wash--"Amongst all the occasions in which it is most difficult and glorious to
keep muddle out of a family, 'the great wash' stands pre-eminent; and as very little money
is now saved by having everything done at home, many ladies, with the option of taking another
servant or putting out the chief part of the washing, have thankfully adopted the latter course."
She goes on to say--"When a gentleman who dines at home can't bear washing in the house, but
gladly pays for its being done elsewhere, the lady should gratefully submit to his wishes,
and put out anything in her whole establishment rather than put out a good and generous husband."

2356. A bustling and active girl will always find time to do a little needlework for herself,
if she lives with consistent and reasonable people. In the summer evenings she should manage
to sit down for two or three hours, and for a short time in the afternoon in leisure days.
A general servant's duties are so multifarious, that unless she be quick and active, she will
not be able to accomplish this. To discharge these various duties properly is a difficult task,
and sometimes a thankless office; but it must be remembered that a good maid-of-all-work will
make a good servant in any capacity, and may be safely taken not only without fear of failure,
but with every probability of giving satisfaction to her employer.

DUTIES OF THE DAIRY-MAID.

2357. The duties of the dairy-maid differ considerably in different districts. In Scotland,
Wales, and some of the northern counties, women milk the cows. On some of the large dairy farms
in other parts of England, she takes her share in the milking, but in private families the
milking is generally performed by the cowkeeper, and the dairy-maid only receives the milkpails
from him morning and night, and empties and cleans them preparatory to the next milking; her
duty being to supply the family with milk, cream, and butter, and other luxuries depending
on the "milky mothers" of the herd.

    2358. The Dairy.--The object with which gentlemen keep cows is
    to procure milk unadulterated, and sweet butter, for themselves
    and families: in order to obtain this, however, great
    cleanliness is required, and as visitors, as well as the
    mistress of the house, sometimes visit the dairy, some efforts
    are usually made to render it ornamental and picturesque. The
    locality is usually fixed near to the house; it should neither
    be exposed to the fierce heat of the summer's sun nor to the
    equally unfavourable frosts of winter--it must be both sheltered
    and shaded. If it is a building apart from the house and other
    offices, the walls should be tolerably thick, and if hollow, the
    temperature will be more equable. The walls inside are usually
    covered with Dutch glazed tiles; the flooring also of glazed
    tiles set in asphalte, to resist water; and the ceiling, lath
    and plaster, or closely-jointed woodwork, painted. Its
    architecture will be a matter of fancy: it should have a
    northern aspect, and a thatched roof is considered most
    suitable, from the shade and shelter it affords; and it should
    contain at least two apartments, besides a cool place for
    storing away butter. One of the apartments, in which the milk is
    placed to deposit cream, or to ripen for churning, is usually
    surrounded by shelves of marble or slate, on which the
    milk-dishes rest; but it will be found a better plan to have a
    large square or round table of stone in the centre, with a
    water-tight ledge all round it, in which water may remain in hot
    weather, or, if some attempt at the picturesque is desired, a
    small fountain might occupy the centre, which would keep the
    apartment cool and fresh. Round this table the milk-dishes
    should be ranged; one shelf, or dresser, of slate or marble,
    being kept for the various occupations of the dairy-maid: it
    will be found a better plan than putting them on shelves and
    corners against the wall. There should be a funnel or ventilator
    in the ceiling, communicating with the open air, made to open
    and shut as required. Double windows are recommended, but of the
    lattice kind, so that they may open, and with wire-gauze blinds
    fitted into the opening, and calico blinds, which may be wetted
    when additional coolness is required. The other apartment will
    be used for churning, washing, and scrubbing--in fact, the
    scullery of the dairy, with a boiler for hot water, and a sink
    with cold water laid on, which should be plentiful and good. In
    some dairies a third apartment, or, at least, a cool airy
    pantry, is required for storing away butter, with shelves of
    marble or slate, to hold the cream-jars while it is ripening;
    and where cheeses are made, a fourth becomes necessary. The
    dairy utensils are not numerous,--churns, milk-pails for
    each cow, hair-sieves, slices of tin, milk-pans, marble
    dishes for cream for family use, scales and weights, a portable
    rack for drying the utensils, wooden bowls, butter-moulds and
    butter-patters, and wooden tubs for washing the utensils,
    comprising pretty nearly everything.

    2359. Pails are made of maple-wood or elm, and hooped, or of
    tin, more or less ornamented. One is required for each cow.

    2360. The Hair-Sieve is made of closely-twisted horse-hair,
    with a rim, through which the milk is strained to remove any
    hairs which may have dropped from the cow in milking.

    2361. Milk-Dishes are shallow basins of glass, of glazed
    earthenware, or tin, about 16 inches in diameter at top, and 12
    at the bottom, and 5 or 6 inches deep, holding about 8 to 10
    quarts each when full.

    2362. Churns are of all sorts and sizes, from that which
    churns 70 or 80 gallons by means of a strap from the engine, to
    the square box in which a pound of butter is made. The churn
    used for families is a square box, 18 inches by 12 or 13, and 17
    deep, bevelled below to the plane of the dashers, with a loose
    lid or cover. The dasher consists of an axis of wood, to which
    the four beaters or fanners are attached; these fans are simply
    four pieces of elm strongly dovetailed together, forming an
    oblong square, with a space left open, two of the openings being
    left broader than the others; attached to an axle, they form an
    axis with four projecting blades; the axle fits into supports at
    the centre of the box; a handle is fitted to it, and the act of
    churning is done by turning the handle.

    2363. Such is the temple in which the dairy-maid presides: it
    should be removed both from stable and cowhouse, and larder; no
    animal smells should come near it, and the drainage should be
    perfect.

2364. The dairy-maid receives the milk from the cowkeeper, each pail being strained through
the hair-sieve into one of the milk-basins. This is left in the basins from twenty-four to
thirty-six hours in the summer, according to the weather; after which it is skimmed off by
means of the slicer, and poured into glazed earthenware jars to "turn" for churning. Some persons
prefer making up a separate churning for the milk of each cow; in which there is some advantage.
In this case the basins of each cow, for two days, would either be kept together or labelled.
As soon as emptied, the pails should be scalded and every particle of milk washed out, and
placed away in a dry place till next required; and all milk spilt on the floor, or on the table
or dresser, cleaned up with a cloth and hot water. Where very great attention is paid to the
dairy, the milk-coolers are used larger in winter, when it is desirable to retard the cooling
down and increase the creamy deposit, and smaller in summer, to hasten it; the temperature
required being from 55° to 50°, In summer it is sometimes expedient, in very sultry weather,
to keep the dairy fresh and cool by suspending cloths dipped in chloride of lime across the room.

2365. In some dairies it is usual to churn twice, and in others three times a week: the former
produces the best butter, the other the greatest quantity. With three cows, the produce should
be 27 to 30 quarts a day. The dairy-maid should churn every day when very hot, if they are
in full milk, and every second day in more temperate weather; besides supplying the milk and
cream required for a large establishment. The churning should always be done in the morning:
the dairy-maid will find it advantageous in being at work on churning mornings by five o'clock.
The operation occupies from 20 minutes to half an hour in summer, and considerably longer in
winter. A steady uniform motion is necessary to produce sweet butter; neither too quick nor
too slow. Rapid motion causes the cream to heave and swell, from too much air being forced
into it: the result is a tedious churning, and soft, bad-coloured butter.

2366. In spring and summer, when the cow has her natural food, no artificial colour is required;
but in winter, under stall-feeding, the colour is white and tallowy, and some persons prefer
a higher colour. This is communicated by mixing a little finely-powdered arnotto with the cream
before putting it into the churn; a still more, natural and delicate colour is communicated
by scraping a red carrot into a clean piece of linen cloth, dipping it into water, and squeezing
it into the cream.

2367. As soon as the butter comes, the milk is poured off, and the butter put into a shallow
wooden tub or bowl, full of pure spring water, in which it is washed and kneaded, pouring off
the water, and renewing it until it comes away perfectly free from milk. Imperfect washing
is the frequent cause of bad butter, and in nothing is the skill of the dairy-maid tested more
than in this process; moreover, it is one in which cleanliness of habits and person are most
necessary. In this operation we want the aid of Phyllis's neat, soft, and perfectly clean hand;
for no mechanical operation can so well squeeze out the sour particles of milk or curd.

2368. The operations of churning and butter-making over, the butter-milk is disposed of: usually,
in England, it goes to the pigs; but it is a, very wholesome beverage when fresh, and some
persons like it; the disposal, therefore, will rest with the mistress: the dairy-maid's duty
is to get rid of it. She must then scald with boiling water and scrub out every utensil she
has used; brush out the churn, clean out the cream-jars, which will probably require the use
of a little common soda to purify; wipe all dry, and place them in a position where the sun
can reach them for a short time, to sweeten them.

    2369. In Devonshire, celebrated for its dairy system, the milk
    is always scalded. The milk-pans, which are of tin, and contain
    from 10 to 12 quarts, after standing 10 or 12 hours, are placed
    on a hot plate of iron, over a stove, until the cream has formed
    on the surface, which is indicated by the air-bubbles rising
    through the milk, and producing blisters on the surface-coating
    of cream. This indicates its approach to the boiling point: and
    the vessel is now removed to cool. When sufficiently, that is,
    quite cool, the cream is skimmed off with the slice: it is now
    the clouted cream for which Devonshire is so famous. It is now
    placed in the churn, and churned until the butter comes, which
    it generally does in a much shorter time than by the other
    process. The butter so made contains more caseine than butter
    made in the usual way, but does not keep so long.

2370. It is a question frequently discussed, how far it is economical for families to keep
cows and make their own butter. It is calculated that a good cow costs from May 1 to October
1, when well but economically kept, £5. 16s. 6d; and from October 1 to April 30, £10. 2s. 6d.
During that time she should produce 227 lbs. of butter, besides the skimmed milk. Of course,
if new milk and cream are required, that will diminish the quantity of butter.

2371. Besides churning and keeping her dairy in order, the dairy-maid has charge of the whole
produce, handing it over to the cook, butler, or housemaid as required; and she will do well
to keep an exact account both of what she receives and how and when she disposes of it.

DUTIES OF THE LAUNDRY-MAID.

2372. The laundry-maid is charged with the duty of washing and getting-up the family linen,--a
situation of great importance where the washing is all done at home; but in large towns, where
there is little convenience for bleaching and drying, it is chiefly done by professional laundresses
and companies, who apply mechanical and chemical processes to the purpose. These processes,
however, are supposed to injure the fabric of the linen; and in many families the fine linen,
cottons, and muslins, are washed and got-up at home, even where the bulk of the washing is
given out. In country and suburban houses, where greater conveniences exist, washing at home
is more common,--in country places universal.

2373. The laundry establishment consists of a washing-house, an ironing and drying-room, and
sometimes a drying-closet heated by furnaces. The washing-house will probably be attached to
the kitchen; but it is better that it should be completely detached from it, and of one story,
with a funnel or shaft to carry off the steam. It will be of a size proportioned to the extent
of the washing to be done. A range of tubs, either round or oblong, opposite to, and sloping
towards, the light, narrower at the bottom than the top, for convenience in stooping over,
and fixed at a height suited to the convenience of the women using them; each tub having a
tap for hot and cold water, and another in the bottom, communicating with the drains, for drawing
off foul water. A boiler and furnace, proportioned in size to the wants of the family, should
also be fixed. The flooring should be York stone, laid on brick piers, with good drainage,
or asphalte, sloping gently towards a gutter connected with the drain.

2374. Adjoining the bleaching-house, a second room, about the same size, is required for ironing,
drying, and mangling. The contents of this room should comprise an ironing-board, opposite
to the light; a strong white deal table, about twelve or fourteen feet long, and about three
and a half feet broad, with drawers for ironing-blankets; a mangle in one corner, and clothes-horses
for drying and airing; cupboards for holding the various irons, starch, and other articles
used in ironing; a hot-plate built in the chimney, with furnace beneath it for heating the
irons; sometimes arranged with a flue for carrying the hot air round the room for drying. Where
this is the case, however, there should be a funnel in the ceiling for ventilation and carrying
off steam; but a better arrangement is to have a hot-air closet adjoining, heated by hot-air
pipes, and lined with iron, with proper arrangements for carrying off steam, and clothes-horses
on castors running in grooves, to run into it for drying purposes. This leaves the laundry
free from unwholesome vapour.

2375. The laundry-maid should commence her labours on Monday morning by a careful examination
of the articles committed to her care, and enter them in the washing-book; separating the white
linen and collars, sheets and body-linen, into one heap, fine muslins into another, coloured
cotton and linen fabrics into a third, woollens into a fourth, and the coarser kitchen and
other greasy cloths into a fifth. Every article should be examined for ink- or grease-spots,
or for fruit- or wine-stains. Ink-spots are removed by dipping the part into hot water, and
then spreading it smoothly on the hand or on the back of a spoon, pouring a few drops of oxalic
acid or salts of sorel over the ink-spot, rubbing and rinsing it in cold water till removed;
grease-spots, by rubbing over with yellow soap, and rinsing in hot water; fruit- and wine-spots,
by dipping in a solution of sal ammonia or spirits of wine, and rinsing.

2376. Every article having been examined and assorted, the sheets and fine linen should be
placed in one of the tubs and just covered with lukewarm water, in which a little soda has
been dissolved and mixed, and left there to soak till the morning. The greasy cloths and dirtier
things should be laid to soak in another tub, in a liquor composed of 1/2 lb. of unslaked lime
to every 6 quarts of water which has been boiled for two hours, then left to settle, and strained
off when clear. Each article should be rinsed in this liquor to wet it thoroughly, and left
to soak till the morning, just covered by it when the things are pressed together. Coppers
and boilers should now be filled, and the fires laid ready to light.

2377. Early on the following morning the fires should be lighted, and as soon as hot water
can be procured, washing commenced; the sheets and body-linen being wanted to whiten in the
morning, should be taken first; each article being removed in succession from the lye in which
it has been soaking, rinsed, rubbed, and wrung, and laid aside until the tub is empty, when
the foul water is drawn off. The tub should be again filled with luke-warm water, about 80°,
in which the articles should again be plunged, and each gone over carefully with soap, and
rubbed. Novices in the art sometimes rub the linen against the skin; more experienced washerwomen
rub one linen surface against the other, which saves their hands, and enables them to continue
their labour much longer, besides economizing time, two parts being thus cleaned at once.

2378. After this first washing, the linen should be put into a second water as hot as the hand
can bear, and again rubbed over in every part, examining every part for spots not yet moved,
which require to be again soaped over and rubbed till thoroughly clean; then rinsed and wrung,
the larger and stronger articles by two of the women; the smaller and more delicate articles
requiring gentler treatment.

2379. In order to remove every particle of soap, and produce a good colour, they should now
be placed, and boiled for about an hour and a half in the copper, in which soda, in the proportion
of a teaspoonful to every two gallons of water, has been dissolved. Some very careful laundresses
put the linen into a canvas bag to protect it from the scum and the sides of the copper. When
taken out, it should again be rinsed, first in clean hot water, and then in abundance of cold
water slightly tinged with fig-blue, and again wrung dry. It should now be removed from the
washing-house and hung up to dry or spread out to bleach, if there are conveniences for it;
and the earlier in the day this is done, the clearer and whiter will be the linen.

2380. Coloured muslins, cottons, and linens, require a milder treatment; any application of
soda will discharge the colour, and soaking all night, even in pure water, deteriorates the
more delicate tints. When ready for washing, if not too dirty, they should be put into cold
water and washed very speedily, using the common yellow soap, which should be rinsed off immediately.
One article should be washed at a time, and rinsed out immediately before any others are wetted.
When washed thoroughly, they should be rinsed in succession in soft water, in which common
salt has been dissolved, in the proportion of a handful to three or four gallons, and afterwards
wrung gently, as soon as rinsed, with as little twisting as possible, and then hung out to
dry. Delicate-coloured articles should not be exposed to the sun, but dried in the shade, using
clean lines and wooden pegs.

2381. Woollen articles are liable to shrink, unless the flannel has been well shrunk before
making up. This liability is increased where very hot water is used: cold water would thus
be the best to wash woollens in; but, as this would not remove the dirt, lukewarm water, about
85°, and yellow soap, are recommended. When thoroughly washed in this, they require a good
deal of rinsing in cold water, to remove the soap.

2382. Greasy cloths, which have soaked all night in the liquid described, should be now washed
out with soap-and-water as hot as the hands can bear, first in one water, and rinsed out in
a second; and afterwards boiled for two hours in water in which a little soda is dissolved.
When taken out, they should be rinsed in cold water, and laid out or hung up to dry.

2383. Silk handkerchiefs require to be washed alone. When they contain snuff, they should be
soaked by themselves in lukewarm water two or three hours; they should be rinsed out and put
to soak with the others in cold water for an hour or two; then washed in lukewarm water, being
soaped as they are washed. If this does not remove all stains, they should be washed a second
time in similar water, and, when finished, rinsed in soft water in which a handful of common
salt has been dissolved. In washing stuff or woollen dresses, the band at the waist and the
lining at the bottom should be removed, and wherever it is gathered into folds; and, in furniture,
the hems and gatherings. A black silk dress, if very dirty, must be washed; but, if only soiled,
soaking for four-and-twenty hours will do; if old and rusty, a pint of common spirits should
be mixed with each gallon of water, which is an improvement under any circumstances. Whether
soaked or washed, it should be hung up to drain, and dried without wringing.

2384. Satin and silk ribbons, both white and coloured, may be cleaned in the same manner.

2385. Silks, when washed, should be dried in the shade, on a linen-horse, taking care that
they are kept smooth and unwrinkled. If black or blue, they will be improved if laid again
on the table, when dry, and sponged with gin, or whiskey, or other white spirit.

2386. The operations should be concluded by rinsing the tubs, cleaning the coppers, scrubbing
the floors of the washing-house, and restoring everything to order and cleanliness.

2387. Thursday and Friday, in a laundry in full employ, are usually devoted to mangling, starching,
and ironing.

2388. Linen, cotton, and other fabrics, after being washed and dried, are made smooth and glossy
by mangling and by ironing. The mangling process, which is simply passing them between rollers
subjected to a very considerable pressure, produced by weight, is confined to sheets, towels,
table-linen, and similar articles, which are without folds or plaits. Ironing is necessary
to smooth body-linen, and made-up articles of delicate texture or gathered into folds. The
mangle is too well known to need description.

    2389. Ironing.--The irons consist of the common flat-iron,
    which is of different sizes, varying from 4 to 10 inches in
    length, triangular in form, and from 2-1/2 to 4-1/2 inches in
    width at the broad end; the oval iron, which is used for more
    delicate articles; and the box-iron, which is hollow, and heated
    by a red-hot iron inserted into the box. The Italian iron is a
    hollow tube, smooth on the outside, and raised on a slender
    pedestal with a footstalk. Into the hollow cylinder a red-hot
    iron is pushed, which heats it; and the smooth outside of the
    latter is used, on which articles such as frills, and plaited
    articles, are drawn. Crimping- and gauffering-machines are used
    for a kind of plaiting where much regularity is required, the
    articles being passed through two iron rollers fluted so as to
    represent the kind of plait or fold required.

2390. Starching is a process by which stiffness is communicated to certain parts of linen,
as the collar and front of shirts, by dipping them in a paste made of starch boiled in water,
mixed with a little gum Arabic, where extra stiffness is required.

TO MAKE STARCH.

2391. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 pint of cold water and 1 quart of boiling water to every 2 tablespoonfuls
of starch.

Mode.--Put the starch into a tolerably large basin; pour over it the cold water, and stir the
mixture well with a wooden spoon until it is perfectly free from lumps, and quite smooth. Then
take the basin to the fire, and whilst the water is actually boiling in the kettle or boiler,
pour it over the starch, stirring it the whole time. If made properly in this manner, the starch
will require no further boiling; but should the water not be boiling when added to the starch,
it will not thicken, and must be put into a clean saucepan, and stirred over the fire until
it boils. Take it off the fire, strain it into a clean basin, cover it up to prevent a skin
forming on the top, and, when sufficiently cool that the hand may be borne in it, starch the
things. Many persons, to give a shiny and smooth appearance to the linen when ironed, stir
round two or three times in the starch a piece of wax candle, which also prevents the iron
from sticking.

2392. When the "things to be starched" are washed, dried, and taken off the lines, they should
be dipped into the hot starch made as directed, squeezed out of it, and then just dipped into
cold water, and immediately squeezed dry. If fine things be wrung, or roughly used, they are
very liable to tear; so too much care cannot be exercised in this respect. If the article is
lace, clap it between the hands a few times, which will assist to clear it; then have ready
laid out on the table a large clean towel or cloth; shake out the starched things, lay them
on the cloth, and roll it up tightly, and let it remain for three or fours, when the things
will be ready to iron.

2393. To be able to iron properly requires much practice and experience. Strict cleanliness
with all the ironing utensils must be observed, as, if this is not the case, not the most expert
ironer will be able to make her things look clear and free from smears, &c. After wiping down
her ironing table, the laundry-maid should place a coarse cloth on it, and over that the ironing-blanket,
with her stand and iron-rubber; and having ascertained that her irons are quite clean and of
the right heat, she proceeds with her work.

2394. It is a good plan to try the heat of the iron on a coarse cloth or apron before ironing
anything fine: there is then no danger of scorching. For ironing fine things, such as collars,
cuffs, muslins, and laces, there is nothing so clean and nice to use as the box-iron; the bottom
being bright, and never placed near the fire, it is always perfectly clean; it should, however,
be kept in a dry place, for fear of its rusting. Gauffering-tongs or irons must be placed in
a clear fire for a minute, then withdrawn, wiped with a coarse rubber, and the heat of them
tried on a piece of paper, as, unless great care is taken, these will very soon scorch.

2395. The skirts of muslin dresses should be ironed on a skirt-board covered with flannel,
and the fronts of shirts on a smaller board, also covered with flannel; this board being placed
between the back and front.

2396. After things are mangled, they should also be ironed in the folds and gathers; dinner-napkins
smoothed over, as also table-cloths, pillow-cases, and sometimes sheets. The bands of flannel
petticoats, and shoulder-straps to flannel waistcoats, must also undergo the same process.

UPPER AND UNDER NURSEMAIDS.

2397. The nursery is of great importance in every family, and in families of distinction, where
there are several young children, it is an establishment kept apart from the rest of the family,
under the charge of an upper nurse, assisted by under nursery-maids proportioned to the work
to be done. The responsible duties of upper nursemaid commence with the weaning of the child:
it must now be separated from the mother or wet-nurse, at least for a time, and the cares of
the nursemaid, which have hitherto been only occasionally put in requisition, are now to be
entirely devoted to the infant. She washes, dresses, and feeds it; walks out with it, and regulates
all its little wants; and, even at this early age, many good qualities are required to do so
in a satisfactory manner. Patience and good temper are indispensable qualities; truthfulness,
purity of manners, minute cleanliness, and docility and obedience, almost equally so. She ought
also to be acquainted with the art of ironing and trimming little caps, and be handy with her
needle.

    2398. There is a considerable art in carrying an infant
    comfortably for itself and for the nursemaid. If she carry it
    always seated upright on her arm, and presses it too closely
    against her chest, the stomach of the child is apt to get
    compressed, and the back fatigued. For her own comfort, a good
    nurse will frequently vary this position, by changing from one
    arm to the other, and sometimes by laying it across both,
    raising the head a little. When teaching it to walk, and guiding
    it by the hand, she should change the hand from time to time, so
    as to avoid raising one shoulder higher than the other. This is
    the only way in which a child should be taught to walk;
    leading-strings and other foolish inventions, which force an
    infant to make efforts, with its shoulders and head forward,
    before it knows how to use its limbs, will only render it
    feeble, and retard its progress.

    2399. Most children have some bad habit, of which they must be
    broken; but this is never accomplished by harshness without
    developing worse evils: kindness, perseverance, and patience in
    the nurse, are here of the utmost importance. When
    finger-sucking is one of these habits, the fingers are sometimes
    rubbed with bitter aloes, or some equally disagreeable
    substance. Others have dirty habits, which are only to be
    changed by patience, perseverance, and, above all, by regularity
    in the nurse. She should never be permitted to inflict
    punishment on these occasions, or, indeed, on any occasion. But,
    if punishment is to be avoided, it is still more necessary that
    all kinds of indulgences and flattery be equally forbidden.
    Yielding to all the whims of a child,--picking up its toys when
    thrown away in mere wantonness, would be intolerable. A child
    should never be led to think others inferior to it, to beat a
    dog, or even the stone against which it falls, as some children
    are taught to do by silly nurses. Neither should the nurse
    affect or show alarm at any of the little accidents which must
    inevitably happen: if it falls, treat it as a trifle; otherwise
    she encourages a spirit of cowardice and timidity. But she will
    take care that such accidents are not of frequent occurrence, or
    the result of neglect.

    2400. The nurse should keep the child as clean as possible, and
    particularly she should train it to habits of cleanliness, so
    that it should feel uncomfortable when otherwise; watching
    especially that it does not soil itself in eating. At the same
    time, vanity in its personal appearance is not to be encouraged
    by over-care in this respect, or by too tight lacing or
    buttoning of dresses, nor a small foot cultivated by the use of
    tight shoes.

    2401. Nursemaids would do well to repeat to the parents
    faithfully and truly the defects they observe in the
    dispositions of very young children. If properly checked in
    time, evil propensities may be eradicated; but this should not
    extend to anything but serious defects; otherwise, the intuitive
    perceptions which all children possess will construe the act
    into "spying" and "informing," which should never be resorted to
    in the case of children, nor, indeed, in any case.

2402. Such are the cares which devolve upon the nursemaid, and it is her duty to fulfil them
personally. In large establishments she will have assistants proportioned to the number of
children of which she has the care. The under nursemaid lights the fires, sweeps, scours, and
dusts the rooms, and makes the beds; empties slops, and carries up water; brings up and removes
the nursery meals; washes and dresses all the children, except the infant, and assists in mending.
Where there is a nursery girl to assist, she does the rougher part of the cleaning; and all
take their meals in the nursery together, after the children of the family have done.

2403. In smaller families, where there is only one nursemaid kept, she is assisted by the housemaid,
or servant-of-all-work, who will do the rougher part of the work, and carry up the nursery
meals. In such circumstances she will be more immediately under the eye of her mistress, who
will probably relieve her from some of the cares of the infant. In higher families, the upper
nurse is usually permitted to sup or dine occasionally at the housekeeper's table by way of
relaxation, when the children are all well, and her subordinates trustworthy.

2404. Where the nurse has the entire charge of the nursery, and the mother is too much occupied
to do more than pay a daily visit to it, it is desirable that she be a person of observation,
and possess some acquaintance with the diseases incident to childhood, as also with such simple
remedies as may be useful before a medical attendant can be procured, or where such attendance
is not considered necessary. All these little ailments are preceded by symptoms so minute as
to be only perceptible to close observation; such as twitching of the brows, restless sleep,
grinding the gums, and, in some inflammatory diseases, even to the child abstaining from crying,
from fear of the increased pain produced by the movement. Dentition, or cutting the teeth,
is attended with many of these symptoms. Measles, thrush, scarlatina, croup, hooping-cough,
and other childish complaints, are all preceded by well-known symptoms, which may be alleviated
and rendered less virulent by simple remedies instantaneously applied.

2405. Dentition is usually the first serious trouble, bringing many other disorders in its
train. The symptoms are most perceptible to the mother: the child sucks feebly, and with gums
hot, inflamed, and swollen. In this case, relief is yielded by rubbing them from time to time
with a little of Mrs. Johnson's soothing syrup, a valuable and perfectly safe medicine. Selfish
and thoughtless nurses, and mothers too, sometimes give cordials and sleeping-draughts, whose
effects are too well known.

2406. Convulsion Fits sometimes follow the feverish restlessness produced by these causes;
in which case a hot bath should be administered without delay, and the lower parts of the body
rubbed, the bath being as hot as it can be without scalding the tender skin; at the same time,
the doctor should be sent for immediately, for no nurse should administer medicine in this
case, unless the fits have been repeated and the doctor has left directions with her how to act.

2407. Croup is one of the most alarming diseases of childhood; it is accompanied with a hoarse,
croaking, ringing cough, and comes on very suddenly, and most so in strong, robust children.
A very hot bath should be instantly administered, followed by an emetic, either in the form
of tartar-emetic, croup-powder, or a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha, wrapping the body warmly up
in flannel after the bath. The slightest delay in administering the bath, or the emetic, may
be fatal; hence, the importance of nurses about very young children being acquainted with the
symptoms.

2408. Hooping-Cough is generally preceded by the moaning noise during sleep, which even adults
threatened with the disorder cannot avoid: it is followed by violent fits of coughing, which
little can be done to relieve. A child attacked by this disorder should be kept as much as
possible in the fresh, pure air, but out of draughts, and kept warm, and supplied with plenty
of nourishing food. Many fatal diseases flow from this scourge of childhood, and a change to
purer air, if possible, should follow convalescence.

2409. Worms are the torment of some children: the symptoms are, an unnatural craving for food,
even after a full meal; costiveness, suddenly followed by the reverse; fetid breath, a livid
circle under the eyes, enlarged abdomen, and picking the nose; for which the remedies must
be prescribed by the doctor.

2410. Measles and Scarlatina much resemble each other in their early stages: headache, restlessness,
and fretfulness are the symptoms of both. Shivering fits, succeeded by a hot skin; pains in
the back and limbs, accompanied by sickness, and, in severe cases, sore throat; pain about
the jaws, difficulty in swallowing, running at the eyes, which become red and inflamed, while
the face is hot and flushed, often distinguish scarlatina and scarlet fever, of which it is
only a mild form.

2411. While the case is doubtful, a dessert-spoonful of spirit of nitre diluted in water, given
at bedtime, will throw the child into a gentle perspiration, and will bring out the rash in
either case. In measles, this appears first on the face; in scarlatina, on the chest; and in
both cases a doctor should be called in. In scarlatina, tartar-emetic powder or ipecacuanha
may be administered in the mean time.

2412. In all cases, cleanliness, fresh air, clean utensils, and frequent washing of the person,
both of nurse and children, are even more necessary in the nursery than in either drawing-room
or sick-room, inasmuch as the delicate organs of childhood are more susceptible of injury from
smells and vapours than adults.

2413. It may not be out of place if we conclude this brief notice of the duties of a nursemaid,
by an extract from Florence Nightingale's admirable "Notes on Nursing." Referring to children,
she says:--

    2414. "They are much more susceptible than grown people to all
    noxious influences. They are affected by the same things, but
    much more quickly and seriously; by want of fresh air, of proper
    warmth; want of cleanliness in house, clothes, bedding, or body;
    by improper food, want of punctuality, by dulness, by want of
    light, by too much or too little covering in bed or when up."
    And all this in health; and then she quotes a passage from a
    lecture on sudden deaths in infancy, to show the importance of
    careful nursing of children:--"In the great majority of
    instances, when death suddenly befalls the infant or young
    child, it is an accident; it is not a necessary, inevitable
    result of any disease. That which is known to injure children
    most seriously is foul air; keeping the rooms where they sleep
    closely shut up is destruction to them; and, if the child's
    breathing be disordered by disease, a few hours only of such
    foul air may endanger its life, even where no inconvenience is
    felt by grown-up persons in the room."

    2415. Persons moving in the beat society will see, after
    perusing Miss Nightingale's book, that this "foul air," "want of
    light," "too much or too little clothing," and improper food, is
    not confined to Crown Street or St. Giles's; that Belgravia and
    the squares have their north room, where the rays of the sun
    never reach. "A wooden bedstead, two or three mattresses piled
    up to above the height of the table, a vallance attached to the
    frame,--nothing but a miracle could ever thoroughly dry or air
    such a bed and bedding,"--is the ordinary bed of a private
    house, than which nothing can be more unwholesome. "Don't treat
    your children like sick," she sums up; "don't dose them with
    tea. Let them eat meat and drink milk, or half a glass of light
    beer. Give them fresh, light, sunny, and open rooms, cool
    bedrooms, plenty of outdoor exercise, facing even the cold, and
    wind, and weather, in sufficiently warm clothes, and with
    sufficient exercise, plenty of amusements and play; more
    liberty, and less schooling, and cramming, and training; more
    attention to food and less to physic."

DUTIES OF THE SICK-NURSE.

2416. All women are likely, at some period of their lives, to be called on to perform the duties
of a sick-nurse, and should prepare themselves as much as possible, by observation and reading,
for the occasion when they may be required to perform the office. The main requirements are
good temper, compassion for suffering, sympathy with sufferers, which most women worthy of
the name possess, neat-handedness, quiet manners, love of order, and cleanliness. With these
qualifications there will be very little to be wished for; the desire to relieve suffering
will inspire a thousand little attentions, and surmount the disgusts which some of the offices
attending the sick-room are apt to create. Where serious illness visits a household, and protracted
nursing is likely to become necessary, a professional nurse will probably be engaged, who has
been trained to its duties; but in some families, and those not a few let us hope, the ladies
of the family would oppose such an arrangement as a failure of duty on their part. There is,
besides, even when a professional nurse is ultimately called in, a period of doubt and hesitation,
while disease has not yet developed itself, when the patient must be attended to; and, in these
cases, some of the female servants of the establishment must give their attendance in the sick-room.
There are, also, slight attacks of cold, influenza, and accidents in a thousand forms, to which
all are subject, where domestic nursing becomes a necessity; where disease, though unattended
with danger, is nevertheless accompanied by the nervous irritation incident to illness, and
when all the attention of the domestic nurse becomes necessary.

2417. In the first stage of sickness, while doubt and a little perplexity hang over the household
as to the nature of the sickness, there are some things about which no doubt can exist: the
patient's room must be kept in a perfectly pure state, and arrangements made for proper attendance;
for the first canon of nursing, according to Florence Nightingale, its apostle, is to "keep
the air the patient breathes as pure as the external air, without chilling him." This can be
done without any preparation which might alarm the patient; with proper windows, open fireplaces,
and a supply of fuel, the room may be as fresh as it is outside, and kept at a temperature
suitable for the patient's state.

2418. Windows, however, must be opened from above, and not from below, and draughts avoided;
cool air admitted beneath the patient's head chills the lower strata and the floor. The careful
nurse will keep the door shut when the window is open; she will also take care that the patient
is not placed between the door and the open window, nor between the open fireplace and the
window. If confined to bed, she will see that the bed is placed in a thoroughly ventilated
part of the room, but out of the current of air which is produced by the momentary opening
of doors, as well as out of the line of draught between the window and the open chimney, and
that the temperature of the room is kept about 64°. Where it is necessary to admit air by the
door, the windows should be closed; but there are few circumstances in which good air can be
obtained through the chamber-door; through it, on the contrary, the gases generated in the
lower parts of the house are likely to be drawn into the invalid chamber.

2419. These precautions taken, and plain nourishing diet, such as the patient desires, furnished,
probably little more can be done, unless more serious symptoms present themselves; in which
case medical advice will be sought.

2420. Under no circumstances is ventilation of the sick-room so essential as in cases of febrile
diseases, usually considered infectious; such as typhus and puerperal fevers, influenza, hooping-cough,
small- and chicken-pox, scarlet fever, measles, and erysipelas: all these are considered communicable
through the air; but there is little danger of infection being thus communicated, provided
the room is kept thoroughly ventilated. On the contrary, if this essential be neglected, the
power of infection is greatly increased and concentrated in the confined and impure air; it
settles upon the clothes of the attendants and visitors, especially where they are of wool,
and is frequently communicated to other families in this manner.

2421. Under all circumstances, therefore, the sick-room should be kept as fresh and sweet as
the open air, while the temperature is kept up by artificial heat, taking care that the fire
burns clear, and gives out no smoke into the room; that the room is perfectly clean, wiped
over with a damp cloth every day, if boarded; and swept, after sprinkling with damp tea-leaves,
or other aromatic leaves, if carpeted; that all utensils are emptied and cleaned as soon as
used, and not once in four-and-twenty hours, as is sometimes done. "A slop-pail," Miss Nightingale
says, "should never enter a sick-room; everything should be carried direct to the water-closet,
emptied there, and brought up clean; in the best hospitals the slop-pail is unknown." "I do
not approve," says Miss Nightingale, "of making housemaids of nurses,--that would be waste
of means; but I have seen surgical sisters, women whose hands were worth to them two or three
guineas a week, down on their knees, scouring a room or hut, because they thought it was not
fit for their patients: these women had the true nurse spirit."

2422. Bad smells are sometimes met by sprinkling a little liquid chloride of lime on the floor;
fumigation by burning pastiles is also a common expedient for the purification of the sick-room.
They are useful, but only in the sense hinted at by the medical lecturer, who commenced his
lecture thus:--"Fumigations, gentlemen, are of essential importance; they make so abominable
a smell, that they compel you to open the windows and admit fresh air." In this sense they
are useful, but ineffectual unless the cause be removed, and fresh air admitted.

2423. The sick-room should be quiet; no talking, no gossiping, and, above all, no whispering,--this
is absolute cruelty to the patient; he thinks his complaint the subject, and strains his ear
painfully to catch the sound. No rustling of dresses, nor creaking shoes either; where the
carpets are taken up, the nurse should wear list shoes, or some other noiseless material, and
her dress should be of soft material that does not rustle. Miss Nightingale denounces crinoline,
and quotes Lord Melbourne on the subject of women in the sick-room, who said, "I would rather
have men about me, when ill, than women; it requires very strong health to put up with women."
Ungrateful man! but absolute quiet is necessary in the sick-room.

2424. Never let the patient be waked out of his first sleep by noise, never roused by anything
like a surprise. Always sit in the apartment, so that the patient has you in view, and that
it is not necessary for him to turn in speaking to you. Never keep a patient standing; never
speak to one while moving. Never lean on the sick-bed. Above all, be calm and decisive with
the patient, and prevent all noises over-head.

2425. A careful nurse, when a patient leaves his bed, will open the sheets wide, and throw
the clothes back so as thoroughly to air the bed; She will avoid drying or airing anything
damp in the sick-room.

2426. "It is another fallacy," says Florence Nightingale, "to suppose that night air is injurious;
a great authority told me that, in London, the air is never so good as after ten o'clock, when
smoke has diminished; but then it must be air from without, not within, and not air vitiated
by gaseous airs." "A great fallacy prevails also," she says, in another section, "about flowers
poisoning the air of the sick-room: no one ever saw them over-crowding the sick-room; but,
if they did, they actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen." Cut flowers also decompose
water, and produce oxygen gas. Lilies, and some other very odorous plants, may perhaps give
out smells unsuited to a close room, while the atmosphere of the sick-room should always be
fresh and natural.

2427. "Patients," says Miss Nightingale, "are sometimes starved in the midst of plenty, from
want of attention to the ways which alone make it possible for them to take food. A spoonful
of beef-tea, or arrowroot and wine, or some other light nourishing diet, should be given every
hour, for the patient's stomach will reject large supplies. In very weak patients there is
often a nervous difficulty in swallowing, which is much increased if food is not ready and
presented at the moment when it is wanted: the nurse should be able to discriminate, and know
when this moment is approaching."

2428. Diet suitable for patients will depend, in some degree, on their natural likes and dislikes,
which the nurse will do well to acquaint herself with. Beef-tea is useful and relishing, but
possesses little nourishment; when evaporated, it presents a teaspoonful of solid meat to a
pint of water. Eggs are not equivalent to the same weight of meat. Arrowroot is less nourishing
than flour. Butter is the lightest and most digestible kind of fat. Cream, in some diseases,
cannot be replaced. But, to sum up with some of Miss Nightingale's useful maxims:--Observation
is the nurse's best guide, and the patient's appetite the rule. Half a pint of milk is equal
to a quarter of a pound of meat. Beef-tea is the least nourishing food administered to the
sick; and tea and coffee, she thinks, are both too much excluded from the sick-room.

THE MONTHLY NURSE.

2429. The choice of a monthly nurse is of the utmost importance; and in the case of a young
mother with her first child, it would be well for her to seek advice and counsel from her more
experienced relatives in this matter. In the first place, the engaging a monthly nurse in good
time is of the utmost importance, as, if she be competent and clever, her services will be
sought months beforehand; a good nurse having seldom much of her time disengaged. There are
some qualifications which it is evident the nurse should possess: she should be scrupulously
clean and tidy in her person; honest, sober, and noiseless in her movements; should possess
a natural love for children, and have a strong nerve in case of emergencies. Snuff-taking and
spirit-drinking must not be included in her habits; but these are happily much less frequent
than they were in former days.

2430. Receiving, as she often will, instructions from the doctor, she should bear these in
mind, and carefully carry them out. In those instances where she does not feel herself sufficiently
informed, she should ask advice from the medical man, and not take upon herself to administer
medicines, &c., without his knowledge.

2431. A monthly nurse should be between 30 and 50 years of age, sufficiently old to have had
a little experience, and yet not too old or infirm to be able to perform various duties requiring
strength and bodily vigour. She should be able to wake the moment she is called,--at any hour
of the night, that the mother or child may have their wants immediately attended to. Good temper,
united to a kind and gentle disposition, is indispensable; and, although the nurse will frequently
have much to endure from the whims and caprices of the invalid, she should make allowances
for these, and command her temper, at the same time exerting her authority when it is necessary.

2432. What the nurse has to do in the way of cleaning and dusting her lady's room, depends
entirely on the establishment that is kept. Where there are plenty of servants, the nurse,
of course, has nothing whatever to do but attend on her patient, and ring the bell for anything
she may require. Where the number of domestics is limited, she should not mind keeping her
room in order; that is to say, sweeping and dusting it every morning. If fires be necessary,
the housemaid should always clean the grate, and do all that is wanted in that way, as this,
being rather dirty work, would soil the nurse's dress, and unfit her to approach the bed, or
take the infant without soiling its clothes. In small establishments, too, the nurse should
herself fetch things she may require, and not ring every time she wants anything; and she must,
of course, not leave her invalid unless she sees everything is comfortable; and then only for
a few minutes. When down stairs, and in company with the other servants, the nurse should not
repeat what she may have heard in her lady's room, as much mischief may be done by a gossiping
nurse. As in most houses the monthly nurse is usually sent for a few days before her services
may be required, she should see that all is in readiness; that there be no bustle and hurry
at the time the confinement takes place. She should keep two pairs of sheets thoroughly aired,
as well as night-dresses, flannels, &c. &c. All the things which will be required to dress
the baby the first time should be laid in the basket in readiness, in the order in which they
are to be put on; as well as scissors, thread, a few pieces of soft linen rag, and two or three
flannel squares. If a berceaunette is to be used immediately, the nurse should ascertain that
the mattresses, pillow, &c. are all well aired; and if not already done before she arrives,
she should assist in covering and trimming it, ready for the little occupant. A monthly nurse
should be handy at her needle, as, if she is in the house some time before the baby is born,
she will require some work of this sort; to occupy her time. She should also understand the
making-up of little caps, although we can scarcely say this is one of the nurse's duties. As
most children wear no caps, except out of doors, her powers in this way will not be much taxed.

2433. A nurse should endeavour to make her room as cheerful as possible, and always keep it
clean and tidy. She should empty the chamber utensils as soon as used, and on no account put
things under the bed. Soiled baby's napkins should be rolled up and put into a pan, when they
should be washed out every morning, and hung out to dry: they are then in a fit state to send
to the laundress; and should, on no account, be left dirty, but done every morning in this
way. The bedroom should be kept rather dark, particularly for the first week or ten days; of
a regular temperature, and as free as possible from draughts, at the same time well ventilated
and free from unpleasant smells.

2434. The infant during the month must not be exposed to strong light, or much air; and in
carrying it about the passages, stairs, &c., the nurse should always have its head-flannel
on, to protect the eyes and ears from the currents of air. For the management of children,
we must refer our readers to the following chapters; and we need only say, in conclusion, that
a good nurse should understand the symptoms of various ills incident to this period, as, in
all cases, prevention is better than cure. As young mothers with their first baby are very
often much troubled at first with their breasts, the nurse should understand the art of emptying
them by suction, or some other contrivance. If the breasts are kept well drawn, there will
be but little danger of inflammation; and as the infant at first cannot take all that is necessary,
something must be done to keep the inflammation down. This is one of the greatest difficulties
a nurse has to contend with, and we can only advise her to be very persevering, to rub the
breasts well, and to let the infant suck as soon and as often as possible, until they get in
proper order.

THE WET-NURSE.

2435. We are aware that, according to the opinion of some ladies, there is no domestic theme,
during a certain period of their married lives, more fraught with vexation and disquietude
than that ever-fruitful source of annoyance, "the Nurse;" but, as we believe, there are thousands
of excellent wives and mothers who pass through life without even a temporary embroglio in
the kitchen, or suffering a state of moral hectic the whole time of a nurse's empire in the
nursery or bedroom. Our own experience goes to prove, that although many unqualified persons
palm themselves off on ladies as fully competent for the duties they so rashly and dishonestly
undertake to perform, and thus expose themselves to ill-will and merited censure, there are
still very many fully equal to the legitimate exercise of what they undertake; and if they
do not in every case give entire satisfaction, some of the fault,--and sometimes a great deal
of it,--may be honestly placed to the account of the ladies themselves, who, in many instances,
are so impressed with the propriety of their own method of performing everything, as to insist
upon the adoption of their system in preference to that of the nurse, whose plan is probably
based on a comprehensive forethought, and rendered perfect in all its details by an ample experience.

2436. In all our remarks on this subject, we should remember with gentleness the order of society
from which our nurses are drawn; and that those who make their duty a study, and are termed
professional nurses, have much to endure from the caprice and egotism of their employers; while
others are driven to the occupation from the laudable motive of feeding their own children,
and who, in fulfilling that object, are too often both selfish and sensual, performing, without
further interest than is consistent with their own advantage, the routine of customary duties.

2437. Properly speaking, there are two nurses,--the nurse for the mother and the nurse for
the child, or, the monthly and the wet nurse. Of the former we have already spoken, and will
now proceed to describe the duties of the latter, and add some suggestions as to her age, physical
health, and moral conduct, subjects of the utmost importance as far as the charge intrusted
to her is concerned, and therefore demanding some special remarks.

2438. When from illness, suppression of the milk, accident, or some natural process, the mother
is deprived of the pleasure of rearing her infant, it becomes necessary at once to look around
for a fitting substitute, so that the child may not suffer, by any needless delay, a physical
loss by the deprivation of its natural food. The first consideration should be as regards age,
state of health, and temper.

2439. The age, if possible, should not be less than twenty nor exceed thirty years, with the
health sound in every respect, and the body free from all eruptive disease or local blemish.
The best evidence of a sound state of health will be found in the woman's clear open countenance,
the ruddy tone of the skin, the full, round, and elastic state of the breasts, and especially
in the erectile, firm condition of the nipple, which, in all unhealthy states of the body,
is pendulous, flabby, and relaxed; in which case, the milk is sure to be imperfect in its organization,
and, consequently, deficient in its nutrient qualities. Appetite is another indication of health
in the suckling nurse or mother; for it is impossible a woman can feed her child without having
a corresponding appetite; and though inordinate craving for food is neither desirable nor necessary,
a natural vigour should be experienced at meal-times, and the food taken should be anticipated
and enjoyed.

2440. Besides her health, the moral state of the nurse is to be taken into account, or that
mental discipline or principle of conduct which would deter the nurse from at any time gratifying
her own pleasures and appetites at the cost or suffering of her infant charge.

2441. The conscientiousness and good faith that would prevent a nurse so acting are, unfortunately,
very rare; and many nurses, rather than forego the enjoyment of a favourite dish, though morally
certain of the effect it will have on the child, will, on the first opportunity, feed with
avidity on fried meats, cabbage, cucumbers, pickles, or other crude and injurious aliments,
in defiance of all orders given, or confidence reposed in their word, good sense, and humanity.
And when the infant is afterwards racked with pain, and a night of disquiet alarms the mother,
the doctor is sent for, and the nurse, covering her dereliction by a falsehood, the consequence
of her gluttony is treated as a disease, and the poor infant is dosed for some days with medicines,
that can do it but little if any good, and, in all probability, materially retard its physical
development. The selfish nurse, in her ignorance, believes, too, that as long as she experiences
no admonitory symptoms herself, the child cannot suffer; and satisfied that, whatever is the
cause of its screams and plunges, neither she, nor what she had eaten, had anything to do with
it, with this flattering assurance at her heart, she watches her opportunity, and has another
luxurious feast off the proscribed dainties, till the increasing disturbance in the child's
health, or treachery from the kitchen, opens the eyes of mother and doctor to the nurse's unprincipled
conduct. In all such cases the infant should be spared the infliction of medicine, and, as
a wholesome corrective to herself, and relief to her charge, a good sound dose administered
to the nurse.

2442. Respecting the diet of the wet-nurse, the first point of importance is to fix early and
definite hours for every meal; and the mother should see that no cause is ever allowed to interfere
with their punctuality. The food itself should be light, easy of digestion, and simple. Boiled
or roast meat, with bread and potatoes, with occasionally a piece of sago, rice, or tapioca
pudding, should constitute the dinner, the only meal that requires special comment; broths,
green vegetables, and all acid or salt foods, must be avoided. Fresh fish, once or twice a
week, may be taken; but it is hardly sufficiently nutritious to be often used as a meal. If
the dinner is taken early,--at one o'clock,--there will be no occasion for luncheon, which
too often, to the injury of the child, is made the cover for a first dinner. Half a pint of
stout, with a Reading biscuit, at eleven o'clock, will be abundantly sufficient between breakfast
at eight and a good dinner, with a pint of porter at one o'clock. About eight o'clock in the
evening, half a pint of stout, with another biscuit, may be taken; and for supper, at ten or
half-past, a pint of porter, with a slice of toast or a small amount of bread and cheese, may
conclude the feeding for the day.

2443. Animal food once in twenty-four hours is quite sufficient. All spirits, unless in extreme
cases, should be avoided; and wine is still more seldom needed. With a due quantity of plain
digestible food, and the proportion of stout and porter ordered, with early hours and regularity,
the nurse will not only be strong and healthy herself, but fully capable of rearing a child
in health and strength. There are two points all mothers, who are obliged to employ wet-nurses,
should remember, and be on their guard against. The first is, never to allow a nurse to give
medicine to the infant on her own authority: many have such an infatuated idea of the healing
excellence of castor-oil, that they would administer a dose of this disgusting grease twice
a week, and think they had done a meritorious service to the child. The next point is, to watch
carefully, lest, to insure a night's sleep for herself, she does not dose the infant with Godfrey's
cordial, syrup of poppies, or some narcotic potion, to insure tranquillity to the one and give
the opportunity of sleep to the other. The fact that scores of nurses keep secret bottles of
these deadly syrups, for the purpose of stilling their charges, is notorious; and that many
use them to a fearful extent, is sufficiently patent to all.

2444. It therefore behoves the mother, while obliged to trust to a nurse, to use her best discretion
to guard her child from the unprincipled treatment of the person she must, to a certain extent,
depend upon and trust; and to remember, in all cases, rather than resort to castor-oil or sedatives,
to consult a medical man for her infant in preference to following the counsel of her nurse.

THE REARING, MANAGEMENT, AND DISEASES OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD.

CHAPTER XLII.

Physiology of Life, as illustrated by Respiration, Circulation, and Digestion.

2445. The infantine management of children, like the mother's love for her offspring, seems
to be born with the child, and to be a direct intelligence of Nature. It may thus, at first
sight, appear as inconsistent and presumptuous to tell a woman how to rear her infant as to
instruct her in the manner of loving it. Yet, though Nature is unquestionably the best nurse,
Art makes so admirable a foster-mother, that no sensible woman, in her novitiate of parent,
would refuse the admonitions of art, or the teachings of experience, to consummate her duties
of nurse. It is true that, in a civilized state of society, few young wives reach the epoch
that makes them mothers without some insight, traditional or practical, into the management
of infants: consequently, the cases wherein a woman is left to her own unaided intelligence,
or what, in such a case, may be called instinct, and obliged to trust to the promptings of
nature alone for the well-being of her child, are very rare indeed. Again, every woman is not
gifted with the same physical ability for the harassing duties of a mother; and though Nature,
as a general rule, has endowed all female creation with the attributes necessary to that most
beautiful and, at the same time, holiest function,--the healthy rearing of their offspring,--the
cases are sufficiently numerous to establish the exception, where the mother is either physically
or socially incapacitated from undertaking these most pleasing duties herself, and where, consequently,
she is compelled to trust to adventitious aid for those natural benefits which are at once
the mother's pride and delight to render to her child.

2446. In these cases, when obliged to call in the services of hired assistance, she must trust
the dearest obligation of her life to one who, from her social sphere, has probably notions
of rearing children diametrically opposed to the preconceived ideas of the mother, and at enmity
with all her sentiments of right and prejudices of position.

2447. It has justly been said--we think by Hood--that the children of the poor are not brought
up, but dragged up. However facetious this remark may seem, there is much truth in it; and
that children, reared in the reeking dens of squalor and poverty, live at all, is an apparent
anomaly in the course of things, that, at first sight, would seem to set the laws of sanitary
provision at defiance, and make it appear a perfect waste of time to insist on pure air and
exercise as indispensable necessaries of life, and especially so as regards infantine existence.

2448. We see elaborate care bestowed on a family of children, everything studied that can tend
to their personal comfort,--pure air, pure water, regular ablution, a dietary prescribed by
art, and every precaution adopted that medical judgment and maternal love can dictate, for
the well-being of the parents' hope; and find, in despite of all this care and vigilance, disease
and death invading the guarded treasure. We turn to the foetor and darkness that, in some obscure
court, attend the robust brood who, coated in dirt, and with mud and refuse for playthings,
live and thrive, and grow into manhood, and, in contrast to the pale face and flabby flesh
of the aristocratic child, exhibit strength, vigour, and well-developed frames, and our belief
in the potency of the life-giving elements of air, light, and cleanliness receives a shock
that, at first sight, would appear fatal to the implied benefits of these, in reality, all-sufficient
attributes of health and life.

2449. But as we must enter more largely on this subject hereafter, we shall leave its consideration
for the present, and return to what we were about to say respecting trusting to others' aid
in the rearing of children. Here it is that the young and probably inexperienced mother may
find our remarks not only an assistance but a comfort to her, in as far as, knowing the simplest
and best system to adopt, she may be able to instruct another, and see that her directions
are fully carried out.

2450. The human body, materially considered, is a beautiful piece of mechanism, consisting
of many parts, each one being the centre of a system, and performing its own vital function
irrespectively of the others, and yet dependent for its vitality upon the harmony and health
of the whole. It is, in fact, to a certain extent, like a watch, which, when once wound up
and set in motion, will continue its function of recording true time only so long as every
wheel, spring, and lever performs its allotted duty, and at its allotted time; or till the
limit that man's ingenuity has placed to its existence as a moving automaton has been reached,
or, in other words, till it has run down.

2451. What the key is to the mechanical watch, air is to the physical man. Once admit air into
the mouth and nostrils, and the lungs expand, the heart beats, the blood rushes to the remotest
part of the body, the mouth secretes saliva, to soften and macerate the food; the liver forms
its bile, to separate the nutriment from the digested aliment; the kidneys perform their office;
the eye elaborates its tears, to facilitate motion and impart that glistening to the orb on
which depends so much of its beauty; and a dewy moisture exudes from the skin, protecting the
body from the extremes of heat and cold, and sharpening the perception of touch and feeling.
At the same instant, and in every part, the arteries, like innumerable bees, are everywhere
laying down layers of muscle, bones, teeth, and, in fact, like the coral zoophyte, building
up a continent of life and matter; while the veins, equally busy, are carrying away the débris
and refuse collected from where the zoophyte arteries are building,--this refuse, in its turn,
being conveyed to the liver, there to be converted into bile.

2452. All these--and they are but a few of the vital actions constantly taking place--are the
instant result of one gasp of life-giving air. No subject can be fraught with greater interest
than watching the first spark of life, as it courses with electric speed "through all the gates
and alleys" of the soft, insensate body of the infant. The effect of air on the new-born child
is as remarkable in its results as it is wonderful in its consequence; but to understand this
more intelligibly, it must first be remembered that life consists of the performance of three
vital functions--RESPIRATION, CIRCULATION, and DIGESTION. The lungs digest the air, taking
from it its most nutritious element, the oxygen, to give to the impoverished blood that circulates
through them. The stomach digests the food, and separates the nutriment--chyle--from the aliment,
which it gives to the blood for the development of the frame; and the blood, which is understood
by the term circulation, digests in its passage through the lungs the nutriment--chyle--to
give it quantity and quality, and the oxygen from the air to give it vitality. Hence it will
be seen, that, speaking generally, the three vital functions resolve themselves into one,--DIGESTION;
and that the lungs are the primary and the most important of the vital organs; and respiration,
the first in fact, as we all know it is the last in deed, of all the functions performed by
the living body.

THE LUNGS.--RESPIRATION.

2453. The first effect of air on the infant is a slight tremor about the lips and angles of
the mouth, increasing to twitchings, and finally to a convulsive contraction of the lips and
cheeks, the consequence of sudden cold to the nerves of the face. This spasmodic action produces
a gasp, causing the air to rush through the mouth and nostrils, and enter the windpipe and
upper portion of the flat and contracted lungs, which, like a sponge partly immersed in water,
immediately expand. This is succeeded by a few faint sobs or pants, by which larger volumes
of air are drawn into the chest, till, after a few seconds, and when a greater bulk of the
lungs has become inflated, the breast-bone and ribs rise, the chest expands, and, with a sudden
start, the infant gives utterance to a succession of loud, sharp cries, which have the effect
of filling every cell of the entire organ with air and life. To the anxious mother, the first
voice of her child is, doubtless, the sweetest music she ever heard; and the more loudly it
peals, the greater should be her joy, as it is an indication of health and strength, and not
only shows the perfect expansion of the lungs, but that the process of life has set in with
vigour. Having welcomed in its own existence, like the morning bird, with a shrill note of
gladness, the infant ceases its cry, and, after a few short sobs, usually subsides into sleep
or quietude.

2454. At the same instant that the air rushes into the lungs, the valve, or door between the
two sides of the heart-and through which the blood had previously passed-is closed and hermetically
sealed, and the blood taking a new course, bounds into the lungs, now expanded with air, and
which we have likened to a wetted sponge, to which they bear a not unapt affinity, air being
substituted for water. It here receives the oxygen from the atmosphere, and the chyle, or white
blood, from the digested food, and becomes, in an instant, arterial blood, a vital principle,
from which every solid and fluid of the body is constructed. Besides the lungs, Nature has
provided another respiratory organ, a sort of supplemental lung, that, as well as being a covering
to the body, inspires air and expires moisture;--this is the cuticle, or skin; and so intimate
is the connection between the skin and lungs, that whatever injures the first, is certain to
affect the latter.

2455. Hence the difficulty of breathing experienced after scalds or burns on the cuticle, the
cough that follows the absorption of cold or damp by the skin, the oppressed and laborious
breathing experienced by children in all eruptive diseases, while the rash is coming to the
surface, and the hot, dry skin that always attends congestion of the lungs, and fever.

2456. The great practical advantage derivable from this fact is, the knowledge that whatever
relieves the one benefits the other. Hence, too, the great utility of hot baths in all affections
of the lungs or diseases of the skin; and the reason why exposure to cold or wet is, in nearly
all cases, followed by tightness of the chest, sore throat, difficulty of breathing, and cough.
These symptoms are the consequence of a larger quantity of blood than is natural remaining
in the lungs, and the cough is a mere effort of Nature to throw off the obstruction caused
by the presence of too much blood in the organ of respiration. The hot bath, by causing a larger
amount of blood to rush suddenly to the skin, has the effect of relieving the lungs of their
excess of blood, and by equalizing the circulation, and promoting perspiration from the cuticle,
affords immediate and direct benefit, both to the lungs and the system at large.

THE STOMACH--DIGESTION.

2457. The organs that either directly or indirectly contribute to the process of digestion
are, the mouth, teeth, tongue, and gullet, the stomach, small intestines, the pancreas, the
salivary glands, and the liver. Next to respiration, digestion is the chief function in the
economy of life, as, without the nutritious fluid digested from the aliment, there would be
nothing to supply the immense and constantly recurring waste of the system, caused by the activity
with which the arteries at all periods, but especially during infancy and youth, are building
up the frame and developing the body. In infancy (the period of which our present subject treats),
the series of parts engaged in the process of digestion may be reduced simply to the stomach
and liver, or rather its secretion,--the bile. The stomach is a thick muscular bag, connected
above with the gullet, and, at its lower extremity, with the commencement of the small intestines.
The duty or function of the stomach is to secrete from the arteries spread over its inner surface,
a sharp acid liquid called the gastric juice; this, with a due mixture of saliva, softens,
dissolves, and gradually digests the food or contents of the stomach, reducing the whole into
a soft pulpy mass, which then passes into the first part of the small intestines, where it
comes in contact with the bile from the gall-bladder, which immediately separates the digested
food into two parts, one is a white creamy fluid called chyle, and the absolute concentration
of all nourishment, which is taken up by proper vessels, and, as we have before said, carried
directly to the heart, to be made blood of, and vitalized in the lungs, and thus provide for
the wear and tear of the system. It must be here observed that the stomach can only digest
solids, for fluids, being incapable of that process, can only be absorbed; and without the
result of digestion, animal, at least human life, could not exist. Now, as Nature has ordained
that infantine life shall be supported on liquid aliment, and as, without a digestion the body
would perish, some provision was necessary to meet this difficulty, and that provision was
found in the nature of the liquid itself, or in other words, THE MILK. The process of making
cheese, or fresh curds and whey, is familiar to most persons; but as it is necessary to the
elucidation of our subject, we will briefly repeat it. The internal membrane, or the lining
coat of a calf's stomach, having been removed from the organ, is hung up, like a bladder, to
dry; when required, a piece is cut off, put in a jug, a little warm water poured upon it, and
after a few hours it is fit for use; the liquid so made being called rennet. A little of this
rennet, poured into a basin of warm milk, at once coagulates the greater part, and separates
from it a quantity of thin liquor, called whey. This is precisely the action that takes place
in the infant's stomach after every supply from the breast. The cause is the same in both cases,
the acid of the gastric juice in the infant's stomach immediately converting the milk into
a soft cheese. It is gastric juice, adhering to the calf's stomach, and drawn out by the water,
forming rennet, that makes the curds in the basin. The cheesy substance being a solid, at once
undergoes the process of digestion, is separated into chyle by the bile, and, in a few hours,
finds its way to the infant's heart, to become blood, and commence the architecture of its
little frame. This is the simple process of a baby's digestion:-milk converted into cheese,
cheese into chyle, chyle into blood, and blood into flesh, bone, and tegument-how simple is
the cause, but how sublime and wonderful are the effects!

2458. We have described the most important of the three functions that take place in the infant's
body-respiration and digestion; the third, namely, circulation, we hardly think it necessary
to enter on, not being called for by the requirements of the nurse and mother; so we shall
omit its notice, and proceed from theoretical to more practical considerations. Children of
weakly constitutions are just as likely to be born of robust parents, and those who earn their
bread by toil, as the offspring of luxury and affluence; and, indeed, it is against the ordinary
providence of Nature to suppose the children of the hardworking and necessitous to be hardier
and more vigorous than those of parents blessed with ease and competence.

2459. All children come into the world in the same imploring helplessness, with the same general
organization and wants, and demanding either from the newly-awakened mother's love, or from
the memory of motherly feeling in the nurse, or the common appeals of humanity in those who
undertake the earliest duties of an infant, the same assistance and protection, and the same
fostering care.

THE INFANT.

2460. We have already described the phenomena produced on the new-born child by the contact
of air, which, after a succession of muscular twitchings, becomes endowed with voice, and heralds
its advent by a loud but brief succession of cries. But though this is the general rule, it
sometimes happens (from causes it is unnecessary here to explain) that the infant does not
cry, or give utterance to any audible sounds, or if it does, they are so faint as scarcely
to be distinguished as human accents, plainly indicating that life, as yet, to the new visitor,
is neither a boon nor a blessing; the infant being, in fact, in a state of suspended or imperfect
vitality,--a state of quasi existence, closely approximating the condition of a still-birth.

2461. As soon as this state of things is discovered, the child should be turned on its right
side, and the whole length of the spine, from the head downwards, rubbed with all the fingers
of the right hand, sharply and quickly, without intermission, till the quick action has not
only evoked heat, but electricity in the part, and till the loud and sharp cries of the child
have thoroughly expanded the lungs, and satisfactorily established its life. The operation
will seldom require above a minute to effect, and less frequently demands a repetition. If
there is brandy at hand, the fingers before rubbing may be dipped into that, or any other spirit.

2462. There-is another condition of what we may call "mute births," where the child only makes
short ineffectual gasps, and those at intervals of a minute or two apart, when the lips, eyelids,
and fingers become of a deep purple or slate colour, sometimes half the body remaining white,
while the other half, which was at first swarthy, deepens to a livid hue. This condition of
the infant is owing to the valve between the two sides of the heart remaining open, and allowing
the unvitalized venous blood to enter the arteries and get into the circulation.

2463. The object in this case, as in the previous one, is to dilate the lungs as quickly as
possible, so that, by the sudden effect of a vigorous inspiration, the valve may be firmly
closed, and the impure blood, losing this means of egress, be sent directly to the lungs. The
same treatment is therefore necessary as in the previous case, with the addition, if the friction
along the spine has failed, of a warm bath at a temperature of about 80°, in which the child
is to be plunged up to the neck, first cleansing the mouth and nostrils of the mucus that might
interfere with the free passage of air.

2464. While in the bath, the friction along the spine is to be continued, and if the lungs
still remain unexpended, while one person retains the child in an inclined position in the
water, another should insert the pipe of a small pair of bellows into one nostril, and while
the month is closed and the other nostril compressed on the pipe with the hand of the assistant,
the lungs are to be slowly inflated by steady puffs of air from the bellows, the hand being
removed from the mouth and nose after each inflation, and placed on the pit of the stomach,
and by a steady pressure expelling it out again by the mouth. This process is to be continued,
steadily inflating and expelling the air from the lungs, till, with a sort of tremulous leap,
Nature takes up the process, and the infant begins to gasp, and finally to cry, at first low
and faint, but with every gulp of air increasing in length and strength of volume, when it
is to be removed from the water, and instantly wrapped (all but the face and mouth) in a flannel.
Sometimes, however, all these means will fail in effecting an utterance from the child, which
will lie, with livid lips and a flaccid body, every few minutes opening its mouth with a short
gasping pant, and then subsiding into a state of pulseless inaction, lingering probably some
hours, till the spasmodic pantings growing further apart, it ceases to exist.

2465. The time that this state of negative vitality will linger in the frame of an infant is
remarkable; and even when all the previous operations, though long-continued, have proved ineffectual,
the child will often rally from the simplest of means--the application of dry heat. When removed
from the bath, place three or four hot bricks or tiles on the hearth, and lay the child, loosely
folded in a flannel, on its back along them, taking care that there is but one fold of flannel
between the spine and heated bricks or tiles. When neither of these articles can be procured,
put a few clear pieces of red cinder in a warming-pan, and extend the child in the same manner
along the closed lid. As the heat gradually diffuses itself over the spinal marrow, the child
that was dying, or seemingly dead, will frequently give a sudden and energetic cry, succeeded
in another minute by a long and vigorous peal, making up, in volume and force, for the previous
delay, and instantly confirming its existence by every effort in its nature.

2466. With these two exceptions,--restored by the means we have pointed out to the functions
of life,--we will proceed to the consideration of the child HEALTHILY BORN. Here the first
thing that meets us on the threshold of inquiry, and what is often between mother and nurse
not only a vexed question, but one of vexatious import, is the crying of the child; the mother,
in her natural anxiety, maintaining that her infant must be ill to cause it to cry so much
or so often, and the nurse insisting that all children cry, and that nothing is the matter
with it, and that crying does good, and is, indeed, an especial benefit to infancy. The anxious
and unfamiliar mother, though not convinced by these abstract sayings of the truth or wisdom
of the explanation, takes both for granted; and, giving the nurse credit for more knowledge
and experience on this head than she can have, contentedly resigns herself to the infliction,
as a thing necessary to be endured for the good of the baby, but thinking it, at the same time,
an extraordinary instance of the imperfectibility of Nature as regards the human infant; for
her mind wanders to what she has observed in her childhood with puppies and kittens, who, except
when rudely torn from their nurse, seldom give utterance to any complaining.

2467. We, undoubtedly, believe that crying, to a certain extent, is not only conducive to health,
but positively necessary to the full development and physical economy of the infant's being.
But though holding this opinion, we are far from believing that a child does not very often
cry from pain, thirst, want of food, and attention to its personal comfort; but there is as
much difference in the tone and expression of a child's cry as in the notes of an adult's voice;
and the mother's ear will not be long in discriminating between the sharp peevish whine of
irritation and fever, and the louder intermitting cry that characterizes the want of warmth
and sleep. All these shades of expression in the child's inarticulate voice every nurse should
understand, and every mother will soon teach herself to interpret them with an accuracy equal
to language.

2468. There is no part of a woman's duty to her child that a young mother should so soon make
it her business to study, as the voice of her infant, and the language conveyed in its cry.
The study is neither hard nor difficult; a close attention to its tone, and the expression
of the baby's features, are the two most important points demanding attention. The key to both
the mother will find in her own heart, and the knowledge of her success in the comfort and
smile of her infant. We have two reasons--both strong ones--for urging on mothers the imperative
necessity of early making themselves acquainted with the nature and wants of their child: the
first, that when left to the entire, responsibility of the baby, after the departure of the
nurse, she may be able to undertake her new duties with more confidence than if left to her
own resources and mother's instinct, without a clue to guide her through the mysteries of those
calls that vibrate through every nerve of her nature; and, secondly, that she may be able to
guard her child from the nefarious practices of unprincipled nurses, who, while calming the
mother's mind with false statements as to the character of the baby's cries, rather than lose
their rest, or devote that time which would remove the cause of suffering, administer, behind
the curtains, those deadly narcotics which, while stupefying Nature into sleep, insure for
herself a night of many unbroken hours. Such nurses as have not the hardihood to dose their
infant charges, are often full of other schemes to still that constant and reproachful cry.
The most frequent means employed for this purpose is giving it something to suck,--something
easily hid from the mother,--or, when that is impossible, under the plea of keeping it warm,
the nurse covers it in her lap with a shawl, and, under this blind, surreptitiously inserts
a finger between the parched lips, which possibly moan for drink; and, under this inhuman cheat
and delusion, the infant is pacified, till Nature, balked of its desires, drops into a troubled
sleep. These are two of our reasons for impressing upon mothers the early, the immediate necessity
of putting themselves sympathetically in communication with their child, by at once learning
its hidden language as a delightful task.

2469. We must strenuously warn all mothers on no account to allow the nurse to sleep with the
baby, never herself to lay down with it by her side for a night's rest, never to let it sleep
in the parents' bed, and on no account keep it, longer than absolutely necessary, confined
in on atmosphere loaded with the breath of many adults.

2470. The amount of oxygen required by an infant is so large, and the quantity consumed by
mid-life and age, and the proportion of carbonic acid thrown off from both, so considerable,
that an infant breathing the same air cannot possibly carry on its healthy existence while
deriving its vitality from so corrupted a medium. This objection, always in force, is still
more objectionable at night-time, when doors and windows are closed, and amounts to a condition
of poison, when placed between two adults in sleep, and shut in by bed-curtains; and when,
in addition to the impurities expired from the lungs, we remember, in quiescence and sleep,
how large a portion of mephitic gas is given off from the skin.

2471. Mothers, in the fullness of their affection, believe there is no harbour, sleeping or
awake, where their infants can be so secure from all possible or probable danger as in their
own arms; yet we should astound our readers if we told them the statistical number of infants
who, in despite of their motherly solicitude and love, are annually killed, unwittingly, by
such parents themselves, and this from the persistency in the practice we are so strenuously
condemning. The mother frequently, on awaking, discovers the baby's face closely impacted between
her bosom and her arm, and its body rigid and lifeless; or else so enveloped in the "head-blanket"
and superincumbent bedclothes, as to render breathing a matter of physical impossibility. In
such cases the jury in general returns a verdict of "Accidentally overlaid" but one of "Careless
suffocation" would be more in accordance with truth and justice. The only possible excuse that
can be urged, either by nurse or mother, for this culpable practice, is the plea of imparting
warmth to the infant. But this can always be effected by an extra blanket in the child's crib,
or, if the weather is particularly cold, by a bottle of hot water enveloped in flannel and
placed at the child's feet; while all the objections already urged--as derivable from animal
heat imparted by actual contact--are entirely obviated. There is another evil attending the
sleeping together of the mother and infant, which, as far as regards the latter, we consider
quite as formidable, though not so immediate as the others, and is always followed by more
or less of mischief to the mother. The evil we now allude to is that most injurious practice
of letting the child suck after the mother has fallen asleep, a custom that naturally results
from the former, and which, as we hare already said, is injurious to both mother and child.
It is injurious to the infant by allowing it, without control, to imbibe to distension a fluid
sluggishly secreted and deficient in those vital principles which the want of mental energy,
and of the sympathetic appeals of the child on the mother, so powerfully produce on the secreted
nutriment, while the mother wakes in a state of clammy exhaustion, with giddiness, dimness
of sight, nausea, loss of appetite, and a dull aching pain through the back and between the
shoulders. In fact, she wakes languid and unrefreshed from her sleep, with febrile symptoms
and hectic flushes, caused by her baby vampire, who, while dragging from her her health and
strength, has excited in itself a set of symptoms directly opposite, but fraught with the same
injurious consequences--"functional derangement."

THE MILK.

2472. As Nature has placed in the bosom of the mother the natural food of her offspring, it
must be self-evident to every reflecting woman, that it becomes her duty to study, as far as
lies in her power, to keep that reservoir of nourishment in as pure and invigorating a condition
as possible; for she must remember that the quantity is no proof of the quality of this aliment.

2473. The mother, while suckling, as a general rule, should avoid all sedentary occupations,
take regular exercise, keep her mind as lively and pleasingly occupied as possible, especially
by music and singing. Her diet should be light and nutritious, with a proper sufficiency of
animal food, and of that kind which yields the largest amount of nourishment; and, unless the
digestion is naturally strong, vegetables and fruit should form a very small proportion of
the general dietary, and such preparations as broths, gruels, arrowroot, &c., still less. Tapioca,
or ground-rice pudding, made with several eggs, may be taken freely; but all slops and thin
potations, such as that delusion called chicken-broth, should be avoided, as yielding a very
small amount of nutriment, and a large proportion of flatulence. All purely stimulants should
be avoided as much as possible, especially spirits, unless taken for some special object, and
that medicinally; but as a part of the dietary they should be carefully shunned. Lactation
is always an exhausting process, and as the child increases in size and strength, the drain
upon the mother becomes great and depressing. Then something more even than an abundant diet
is required to keep the mind and body up to a standard sufficiently healthy to admit of a constant
and nutritious secretion being performed without detriment to the physical integrity of the
mother, or injury to the child who imbibes it; and as stimulants are inadmissible, if not positively
injurious, the substitute required is to be found in malt liquor. To the lady accustomed to
her Madeira and sherry, this may appear a very vulgar potation for a delicate young mother
to take instead of the more subtle and condensed elegance of wine; but as we are writing from
experience, and with the avowed object of imparting useful facts and beneficial remedies to
our readers, we allow no social distinctions to interfere with our legitimate object.

2474. We have already said that the suckling mother should avoid stimulants, especially spirituous
ones; and though something of this sort is absolutely necessary to support her strength during
the exhausting process, it should be rather of a tonic than of a stimulating character; and
as all wines contain a large percentage of brandy, they are on that account less beneficial
than the pure juice of the fermented grape might be. But there is another consideration to
be taken into account on this subject; the mother has not only to think of herself, but also
of her infant. Now wines, especially port wine, very often--indeed, most frequently--affect
the baby's bowels, and what might have been grateful to the mother becomes thus a source of
pain and irritation to the child afterwards. Sherry is less open to this objection than other
wines, yet still it very frequently does influence the second participator, or the child whose
mother has taken it.

2475. The nine or twelve months a woman usually suckles must be, to some extent, to most mothers,
a period of privation and penance, and unless she is deaf to the cries of her baby, and insensible
to its kicks and plunges, and will not see in such muscular evidences the griping pains that
rack her child, she will avoid every article that can remotely affect the little being who
draws its sustenance from her. She will see that the babe is acutely affected by all that in
any way influences her, and willingly curtail her own enjoyments, rather than see her infant
rendered feverish, irritable, and uncomfortable. As the best tonic, then, and the most efficacious
indirect stimulant that a mother can take at such times, there is no potation equal to porter
and stout, or, what is better still, an equal part of porter and stout. Ale, except for a few
constitutions, is too subtle and too sweet, generally causing acidity or heartburn, and stout
alone is too potent to admit of a full draught, from its proneness to affect the head; and
quantity, as well as moderate strength, is required to make the draught effectual; the equal
mixture, therefore, of stout and porter yields all the properties desired or desirable as a
medicinal agent for this purpose.

2476. Independently of its invigorating influence on the constitution, porter exerts a marked
and specific effect on the secretion of milk; more powerful in exciting an abundant supply
of that fluid than any other article within the range of the physician's art; and, in cases
of deficient quantity, is the most certain, speedy, and the healthiest means that can be employed
to insure a quick and abundant flow. In cases where malt liquor produces flatulency, a few
grains of the "carbonate of soda" may advantageously be added to each glass immediately before
drinking, which will have the effect of neutralizing any acidity that may be in the porter
at the time, and will also prevent its after-disagreement with the stomach. The quantity to
be taken must depend upon the natural strength of the mother, the age and demand made by the
infant on the parent, and other causes; but the amount should vary from one to two pints a
day, never taking less than half a pint at a time, which should be repeated three or four times
a day.

2477. We have said that the period of suckling is a season of penance to the mother, but this
is not invariably the case; and, as so much must depend upon the natural strength of the stomach,
and its power of assimilating all kinds of food into healthy chyle, it is impossible to define
exceptions. Where a woman feels she can eat any kind of food, without inconvenience or detriment,
she should live during her suckling as she did before; but, as a general rule, we are bound
to advise all mothers to abstain from such articles as pickles, fruits, cucumbers, and all
acid and slowly digestible foods, unless they wish for restless nights and crying infants.

2478. As regards exercise and amusement, we would certainly neither prohibit a mother's dancing,
going to a theatre, nor even from attending an assembly. The first, however, is the best indoor
recreation she can take, and a young mother will do well to often amuse herself in the nursery
with this most excellent means of healthful circulation. The only precaution necessary is to
avoid letting the child suck the milk that has lain long in the breast, or is heated by excessive
action.

2479. Every mother who can, should be provided with a breast-pump, or glass tube, to draw off
the superabundance that has been accumulating in her absence from the child, or the first gush
excited by undue exertion: the subsequent supply of milk will be secreted under the invigorating
influence of a previous healthy stimulus.

2480. As the first milk that is secreted contains a large amount of the saline elements, and
is thin and innutritious, it is most admirably adapted for the purpose Nature designed it to
fulfil,--that of an aperient; but which, unfortunately, it is seldom permitted, in our artificial
mode of living, to perform.

2481. So opposed are we to the objectionable plan of physicking new-born children, that, unless
for positive illness, we would much rather advise that medicine should be administered through
the mother for the first eight or ten weeks of its existence. This practice, which few mothers
will object to, is easily effected by the parent, when such a course is necessary for the child,
taking either a dose of castor-oil, half an ounce of tasteless salts (the phosphate of soda),
one or two teaspoonfuls of magnesia, a dose of lenitive electuary, manna, or any mild and simple
aperient, which, almost before it can have taken effect on herself, will exhibit its action
on her child.

2482. One of the most common errors that mothers fall into while suckling their children, is
that of fancying they are always hungry, and consequently overfeeding them; and with this,
the great mistake of applying the child to the breast on every occasion of its crying, without
investigating the cause of its complaint, and, under the belief that it wants food, putting
the nipple into its crying mouth, until the infant turns in revulsion and petulance from what
it should accept with eagerness and joy. At such times, a few teaspoonfuls of water, slightly
chilled, will often instantly pacify a crying and restless child, who has turned in loathing
from the offered breast; or, after imbibing a few drops, and finding it not what nature craved,
throws back its head in disgust, and cries more petulantly than before. In such a case as this,
the young mother, grieved at her baby's rejection of the tempting present, and distressed at
its cries, and in terror of some injury, over and over ransacks its clothes, believing some
insecure pin can alone be the cause of such sharp complaining, an accident that, from her own
care in dressing, however, is seldom or ever the case.

2483. These abrupt cries of the child, if they do not proceed from thirst, which a little water
will relieve, not unfrequently occur from some unequal pressure, a fold or twist in the "roller,"
or some constriction round the tender body. If this is suspected, the mother must not be content
with merely slackening the strings; the child should be undressed, and the creases and folds
of the hot skin, especially those about the thighs and groins, examined, to see that no powder
has caked, and, becoming hard, irritated the parts. The violet powder should be dusted freely
over all, to cool the skin, and everything put on fresh and smooth. If such precautions have
not afforded relief, and, in addition to the crying, the child plunges or draws up its legs,
the mother may be assured some cause of irritation exists in the stomach or bowels,--either
acidity in the latter or distension from overfeeding in the former; but, from whichever cause,
the child should be "opened" before the fire, and a heated napkin applied all over the abdomen,
the infant being occasionally elevated to a sitting position, and while gently jolted on the
knee, the back should be lightly patted with the hand.

2484. Should the mother have any reason to apprehend that the cause of inconvenience proceeds
from the bladder--a not unfrequent source of pain,--the napkin is to be dipped in hot water,
squeezed out, and immediately applied over the part, and repeated every eight or ten minutes,
for several times in succession, either till the natural relief is afforded, or a cessation
of pain allows of its discontinuance. The pain that young infants often suffer, and the crying
that results from it, is, as we have already said, frequently caused by the mother inconsiderately
overfeeding her child, and is produced by the pain of distension, and the mechanical pressure
of a larger quantity of fluid in the stomach than the gastric juice can convert into cheese
and digest.

2485. Some children are stronger in the enduring power of the stomach than others, and get
rid of the excess by vomiting, concluding every process of suckling by an emission of milk
and curd. Such children are called by nurses "thriving children;" and generally they are so,
simply because their digestion is good, and they have the power of expelling with impunity
that superabundance of aliment which in others is a source of distension, flatulence, and pain.

2486. The length of time an infant should be suckled must depend much on the health and strength
of the child, and the health of the mother, and the quantity and quality of her milk; though,
when all circumstances are favourable, it should never be less than nine, nor exceed fifteen
months; but perhaps the true time will be found in the medium between both. But of this we
may be sure, that Nature never ordained a child to live on suction after having endowed it
with teeth to bite and to grind; and nothing is more out of place and unseemly than to hear
a child, with a set of twenty teeth, ask for "the breast."

2487. The practice of protracted wet-nursing is hurtful to the mother, by keeping up an uncalled-for,
and, after the proper time, an unhealthy drain on her system, while the child either derives
no benefit from what it no longer requires, or it produces a positive injury on its constitution.
After the period when Nature has ordained the child shall live by other means, the secretion
of milk becomes thin and deteriorated, showing in the flabby flesh and puny features of the
child both its loss of nutritious properties and the want of more stimulating aliment.

2488. Though we have said that twelve months is about the medium time a baby should be suckled,
we by no means wish to imply that a child should be fed exclusively on milk for its first year;
quite the reverse; the infant can hardly be too soon made independent of the mother. Thus,
should illness assail her, her milk fail, or any domestic cause abruptly cut off the natural
supply, the child having been annealed to an artificial diet, its life might be safely carried
on without seeking for a wet-nurse, and without the slightest danger to its system.

2489. The advantage to the mother of early accustoming the child to artificial food is as considerable
to herself as beneficial to her infant; the demand on her physical strength in the first instance
will be less severe and exhausting, the child will sleep longer on a less rapidly digestible
aliment, and yield to both more quiet nights, and the mother will be more at liberty to go
out for business or pleasure, another means of sustenance being at hand till her return. Besides
these advantages, by a judicious blending of the two systems of feeding, the infant will acquire
greater constitutional strength, so that, if attacked by sickness or disease, it will have
a much greater chance of resisting its virulence than if dependent alone on the mother, whose
milk, affected by fatigue and the natural anxiety of the parent for her offspring, is at such
a time neither good in its properties nor likely to be beneficial to the patient.

2490. All that we have further to say on suckling is an advice to mothers, that if they wish
to keep a sound and unchapped nipple, and possibly avoid what is called a "broken breast,"
never to put it up with a wet nipple, but always to have a soft handkerchief in readiness,
and the moment that delicate part is drawn from the child's mouth, to dry it carefully of the
milk and saliva that moisten it; and, further, to make a practice of suckling from each breast
alternately.

Dress and Dressing, Washing, &c.

2491. As respects the dress and dressing of a new-born infant, or of a child in arms, during
any stage of its nursing, there are few women who will require us to give them guidance or
directions for their instruction; and though a few hints on the subject may not be out of place
here, yet most women intuitively "take to a baby," and, with a small amount of experience,
are able to perform all the little offices necessary to its comfort and cleanliness with ease
and completeness. We shall, therefore, on this delicate subject hold our peace; and only, from
afar, hint "at what we would," leaving our suggestions to be approved or rejected, according
as they chime with the judgment and the apprehension of our motherly readers.

2492. In these days of intelligence, there are few ladies who have not, in all probability,
seen the manner in which the Indian squaw, the aborigines of Polynesia, and even the Lapp and
Esquimaux, strap down their baby on a board, and by means of a loop suspend it to the bough
of a tree, hang it up to the rafters of the hut, or on travel, dangle it on their backs, outside
the domestic implements, which, as the slave of her master, man, the wronged but uncomplaining
woman carries, in order that her lord may march in unhampered freedom. Cruel and confining
as this system of "backboard" dressing may seem to our modern notions of freedom and exercise,
it is positively less irksome, less confining, and infinitely less prejudicial to health, than
the mummying of children by our grandmothers a hundred, ay, fifty years ago: for what with
chin-stays, back-stays, body-stays, forehead-cloths, rollers, bandages, &c., an infant had
as many girths and strings, to keep head, limbs, and body in one exact position, as a ship
has halyards.

2493. Much of this--indeed we may say all--has been abolished; but still the child is far from
being dressed loosely enough; and we shall never be satisfied till the abominable use of the
pin is avoided in toto in an infant's dressing, and a texture made for all the under garments
of a child of a cool and elastic material.

2494. The manner in which an infant is encircled in a bandage called the "roller," as if it
had fractured ribs, compressing those organs--that, living on suction, must be, for the health
of the child, to a certain degree distended, to obtain sufficient aliment from the fluid imbibed--is
perfectly preposterous. Our humanity, as well as our duty, calls upon us at once to abrogate
and discountenance by every means in our power. Instead of the process of washing and dressing
being made, as with the adult, a refreshment and comfort, it is, by the dawdling manner in
which it is performed, the multiplicity of things used, and the perpetual change of position
of the infant to adjust its complicated clothing, rendered an operation of positive irritation
and annoyance. We, therefore, entreat all mothers to regard this subject in its true light,
and study to the utmost, simplicity in dress, and dispatch in the process.

2495. Children do not so much cry from the washing as from the irritation caused by the frequent
change of position in which they are placed, the number of times they are turned on their face,
on their back, and on their side, by the manipulations demanded by the multiplicity of articles
to be fitted, tacked, and carefully adjusted on their bodies. What mother ever found her girl
of six or seven stand quiet while she was curling her hair? How many times nightly has she
not to reprove her for not standing still during the process! It is the same with the unconscious
infant, who cannot bear to be moved about, and who has no sooner grown reconciled to one position
than it is forced reluctantly into another. It is true, in one instance the child has intelligence
to guide it, and in the other not; but the motitory nerves, in both instances, resent coercion,
and a child cannot be too little handled.

2496. On this account alone, and, for the moment, setting health and comfort out of the question,
we beg mothers to simplify their baby's dress as much as possible; and not only to put on as
little as is absolutely necessary, but to make that as simple in its contrivance and adjustment
as it will admit of; to avoid belly-bands, rollers, girths, and everything that can impede
or confine the natural expansion of the digestive organs, on the due performance of whose functions
the child lives, thrives, and develops its physical being.

REARING BY HAND.

Articles necessary, and how to use them,--Preparation of Foods.-- Baths.--Advantages of Rearing
by Hand.

2497. As we do not for a moment wish to be thought an advocate for an artificial, in preference
to the natural course of rearing children, we beg our renders to understand us perfectly on
this head; all we desire to prove is the fact that a child can be brought up as well on a spoon
dietary as the best example to be found of those reared on the breast; having more strength,
indeed, from the more nutritious food on which it lives. It will be thus less liable to infectious
diseases, and more capable of resisting the virulence of any danger that may attack it; and
without in any way depreciating the nutriment of its natural food, we wish to impress on the
mother's mind that there are many cases of infantine debility which might eventuate in rickets,
curvature of the spine, or mesenteric disease, where the addition to, or total substitution
of, an artificial and more stimulating aliment, would not only give tone and strength to the
constitution, but at the same time render the employment of mechanical means totally unnecessary.
And, finally, though we would never--where the mother had the strength to suckle her child--supersede
the breast, we would insist on making it a rule to accustom the child as early as possible
to the use of an artificial diet, not only that it may acquire more vigour to help it over
the ills of childhood, but that, in the absence of the mother, it might not miss the maternal
sustenance; and also for the parent's sake, that, should the milk, from any cause, become vitiated,
or suddenly cease, the child can be made over to the bottle and the spoon without the slightest
apprehension of hurtful consequences.

2498. To those persons unacquainted with the system, or who may have been erroneously informed
on the matter, the rearing of a child by hand may seem surrounded by innumerable difficulties,
and a large amount of personal trouble and anxiety to the nurse or mother who undertakes the
duty. This, however, is a fallacy in every respect, except as regards the fact of preparing
the food; but even this extra amount of work, by adopting the course we shall lay down, may
be reduced to a very small sum of inconvenience; and as respects anxiety, the only thing calling
for care is the display of judgment in the preparation of the food. The articles required for
the purpose of feeding an infant are a night-lamp, with its pan and lid, to keep the food warm;
a nursing-bottle, with a prepared teat; and a small pap saucepan, for use by day. Of the lamp
we need hardly speak, most mothers being acquainted with its operation: but to those to whom
it is unknown we may observe, that the flame from the floating rushlight heats the water in
the reservoir above, in which the covered pan that contains the food floats, keeping it at
such a heat that, when thinned by milk, it will be of a temperature suitable for immediate
use. Though many kinds of nursing-bottles have been lately invented, and some mounted with
India-rubber nipples, the common glass bottle, with the calf's teat, is equal in cleanliness
and utility to any; besides, the nipple put into the child's mouth is so white and natural
in appearance, that no child taken from the breast will refuse it. The black artificial ones
of caoutchouc or gutta-percha are unnatural. The prepared teats can be obtained at any chemist's,
and as they are kept in spirits, they will require a little soaking in warm water, and gentle
washing, before being tied securely, by means of fine twine, round the neck of the bottle,
just sufficient being left projecting for the child to grasp freely in its lips; for if left
the full length, or over long, it will be drawn too far into the mouth, and possibly make the
infant heave. When once properly adjusted, the nipple need never be removed till replaced by
a new one, which will hardly be necessary oftener than once a fortnight, though with care one
will last for several weeks. The nursing-bottle should be thoroughly washed and cleaned every
day, and always rinsed out before and after using it, the warm water being squeezed through
the nipple, to wash out any particles of food that might lodge in the aperture, and become
sour. The teat can always be kept white and soft by turning the end of the bottle, when not
in use, into a narrow jug containing water, taking care to dry it first, and then to warm it
by drawing the food through before putting it into the child's mouth.

Food, and its Preparation.

2499. The articles generally employed as food for infants consist of arrowroot, bread, flour,
baked flour, prepared groats, farinaceous food, biscuit-powder, biscuits, tops-and-bottoms,
and semolina, or manna croup, as it is otherwise called, which, like tapioca, is the prepared
pith of certain vegetable substances. Of this list the least efficacious, though, perhaps,
the most believed in, is arrowroot, which only as a mere agent, for change, and then only for
a very short time, should ever be employed as a means of diet to infancy or childhood. It is
a thin, flatulent, and innutritious food, and incapable of supporting infantine life with energy.
Bread, though the universal régime with the labouring poor, where the infant's stomach and
digestive powers are a reflex, in miniature, of the father's, should never be given to an infant
under three months, and, even then, however finely beaten up and smoothly made, is a very questionable
diet. Flour, when well boiled, though infinitely better than arrowroot, is still only a kind
of fermentative paste, that counteracts its own good by after-acidity and flatulence.

2500. Baked flour, when cooked into a pale brown mass, and finely powdered, makes a far superior
food to the others, and may be considered as a very useful diet, especially for a change. Prepared
groats may be classed with arrowroot and raw flour, as being innutritious. The articles that
now follow in our list are all good, and such as we could, with conscience and safety, trust
to for the health and development of any child whatever.

2501. We may observe in this place, that an occasional change in the character of the food
is highly desirable, both as regards the health and benefit of the child; and though the interruption
should only last for a day, the change will be advantageous.

2502. The packets sold as farinaceous food are unquestionably the best aliment that can be
given from the first to a baby, and may be continued, with the exception of an occasional change,
without alteration of the material, till the child is able to take its regular meals of animal
and vegetable food. Some infants are so constituted as to require a frequent and total change
in their system of living, seeming to thrive for a certain time on any food given to them,
but if persevered in too long, declining in bulk and appearance as rapidly as they had previously
progressed. In such cases the food should be immediately changed, and when that which appeared
to agree best with the child is resumed, it should be altered in its quality, and perhaps in
its consistency.

2503. For the farinaceous food there are directions with each packet, containing instructions
for the making; but, whatever the food employed is, enough should be made at once to last the
day and night; at first, about a pint basinful, but, as the child advances, a quart will hardly
be too much. In all cases, let the food boil a sufficient time, constantly stirring, and taking
every precaution that it does not get burnt, in which case it is on no account to be used.

2504. The food should always be made with water, the whole sweetened at once, and of such a
consistency that, when poured out, and it has had time to cool, it will cut with the firmness
of a pudding or custard. One or two spoonfuls are to be put into the pap saucepan and stood
on the hob till the heat has softened it, when enough milk is to be added, and carefully mixed
with the food, till the whole has the consistency of ordinary cream; it is then to be poured
into the nursing-bottle, and the food having been drawn through to warm the nipple, it is to
be placed in the child's mouth. For the first month or more, half a bottleful will be quite
enough to give the infant at one time; but, as the child grows, it will be necessary not only
to increase the quantity given at each time, but also gradually to make its food more consistent,
and, after the third month, to add an egg to every pint basin of food made. At night the mother
puts the food into the covered pan of her lamp, instead of the saucepan--that is, enough for
one supply, and, having lighted the rush, she will find, on the waking of her child, the food
sufficiently hot to bear the cooling addition of the milk. But, whether night or day, the same
food should never be heated twice, and what the child leaves should be thrown away.

2505. The biscuit powder is used in the same manner as the farinaceous food, and both prepared
much after the fashion of making starch. But when tops-and-bottoms, or the whole biscuit, are
employed, they require soaking in cold water for some time previous to boiling. The biscuit
or biscuits are then to be slowly boiled in as much water as will, when thoroughly soft, allow
of their being beaten by a three-pronged fork into a fine, smooth, and even pulp, and which,
when poured into a basin and become cold, will cut out like a custard. If two large biscuits
have been so treated, and the child is six or seven months old, beat up two eggs, sufficient
sugar to properly sweeten it, and about a pint of skim milk. Pour this on the beaten biscuit
in the saucepan, stirring constantly; boil for about five minutes, pour into a basin, and use,
when cold, in the same manner as the other.

2506. This makes an admirable food, at once nutritious and strengthening. When tops-and-bottoms
or rusks are used, the quantity of the egg may be reduced, or altogether omitted.

2507. Semolina, or manna croup, being in little hard grains, like a fine millet-seed, must
be boiled for some time, and the milk, sugar, and egg added to it on the fire, and boiled for
a few minutes longer, and, when cold, used as the other preparations.

2508. Many persons entertain a belief that cow's milk is hurtful to infants, and, consequently,
refrain from giving it; but this is a very great mistake, for both sugar and milk should form
a large portion of every meal an infant takes.

TEETHING AND CONVULSIONS.

Fits, &c., the consequence of Dentition, and how to be treated.--The number and order of the
Teeth, and manner in which they are cut.--First and Second Set.

2509. About three months after birth, the infant's troubles may be said to begin; teeth commence
forming in the gums, causing pain and irritation in the mouth, and which, but for the saliva
it causes to flow so abundantly, would be attended with very serious consequences. At the same
time the mother frequently relaxes in the punctuality of the regimen imposed on her, and, taking
some unusual or different food, excites diarrhoea or irritation in her child's stomach, which
not unfrequently results in a rash on the skin, or slight febrile symptoms, which, if not subdued
in their outset, superinduce some more serious form of infantine disease. But, as a general
rule, the teeth are the primary cause of much of the child's sufferings, in consequence of
the state of nervous and functional irritation into which the system is thrown by their formation
and progress out of the jaw and through the gums. We propose beginning this branch of our subject
with that most fertile source of an infant's suffering--

Teething.

2510. That this subject may he better understood by the nurse and mother, and the reason of
the constitutional disturbance that, to a greater or less degree, is experienced by all infants,
may be made intelligible to those who have the care of children, we shall commence by giving
a brief account of the formation of the teeth, the age at which they appear in the mouth, and
the order in which they pierce the gums. The organs of mastication in the adult consist of
32 distinct teeth, 16 in either jaw; being, in fact, a double set. The teeth are divided into
4 incisors, 2 canine, 4 first and second grinders, and 6 molars; but in childhood the complement
or first set consists of only twenty, and these only make their appearance as the development
of the frame indicates the requirement of a different kind of food for the support of the system.
At birth some of the first-cut teeth are found in the cavities of the jaw, in a very small
and rudimentary form; but this is by no means universal. About the third month, the jaws, which
are hollow and divided into separate cells, begin to expand, making room for the slowly developing
teeth, which, arranged for beauty and economy of space lengthwise, gradually turn their tops
upwards, piercing the gum by their edges, which, being sharp, assist in cutting a passage through
the soft parts. There is no particular period at which children cut their teeth, some being
remarkably early, and others equally late. The earliest age that we have ever ourselves known
as a reliable fact was, six weeks. Such peculiarities are generally hereditary, and, as in
this case, common to a whole family. The two extremes are probably represented by six and sixteen
months. Pain and drivelling are the usual, but by no means the general, indications of teething.

2511. About the sixth month the gums become tense and swollen, presenting a red, shiny appearance,
while the salivary glands pour out an unusual quantity of saliva. After a time, a white line
or round spot is observed on the top of one part of the gums, and the sharp edge of the tooth
may be felt beneath if the finger is gently pressed on the part. Through these white spots
the teeth burst their way in the following order:--

2512. Two incisors in the lower jaw are first cut, though, in general, some weeks elapse between
the appearance of the first and the advent of the second. The next teeth cut are the four incisors
of the upper jaw. The next in order are the remaining two incisors of the bottom, one on each
side, then two top and two bottom on each side, but not joining the incisors; and lastly, about
the eighteenth or twentieth month, the four eye teeth, filling up the space left between the
side teeth and the incisors; thus completing the infant's set of sixteen. Sometimes at the
same period, but more frequently some months later, four more double teeth slowly make their
appearance, one on each side of each jaw, completing the entire series of the child's first
set of twenty teeth. It is asserted that a child, while cutting its teeth, should either dribble
excessively, vomit after every meal, or be greatly relaxed. Though one or other, or all of
these at once, may attend a case of teething, it by no means follows that any one of them should
accompany this process of nature, though there can be no doubt that where the pain consequent
on the unyielding state of the gums, and the firmness of the skin that covers the tooth, is
severe, a copious discharge of saliva acts beneficially in saving the head, and also in guarding
the child from those dangerous attacks of fits to which many children in their teething are liable.

2513. The Symptoms that generally indicate the cutting of teeth, in addition to the inflamed
and swollen state of the gums, and increased flow of saliva, are the restless and peevish state
of the child, the hands being thrust into the mouth, and the evident pleasure imparted by rubbing
the finger or nail gently along the gum; the lips are often excoriated, and the functions of
the stomach or bowels are out of order. In severe cases, occurring in unhealthy or scrofulous
children, there are, from the first, considerable fever, disturbed sleep, fretfulness, diarrhoea,
rolling of the eyes, convulsive startings, laborious breathing, coma, or unnatural sleep, ending,
unless the head is quickly relieved, in death.

2514. The Treatment in all cases of painful teething is remarkably simple, and consists in
keeping the body cool by mild aperient medicines, allaying the irritation in the gums by friction
with a rough ivory ring or a stale crust of broad, and when the head, lungs, or any organ is
overloaded or unduly excited, to use the hot bath, and by throwing the body into a perspiration,
equalize the circulation, and relieve the system from the danger of a fatal termination.

2515. Besides these, there is another means, but that must be employed by a medical man; namely,
scarifying the gums--an operation always safe, and which, when judiciously performed, and at
a critical opportunity, will often snatch the child from the grasp of death.

2516. There are few subjects on which mothers have often formed such strong and mistaken opinions
as on that of lancing an infant's gums, some rather seeing their child go into fits--and by
the unrelieved irritation endangering inflammation of the brain, water on the head, rickets,
and other lingering affections--than permit the surgeon to afford instant relief by cutting
through the hard skin, which, like a bladder over the stopper of a bottle, effectually confines
the tooth to the socket, and prevents it piercing the soft, spongy substance of the gum. This
prejudice is a great error, as we shall presently show; for, so far from hurting the child,
there is nothing that will so soon convert an infant's tears into smiles as scarifying the
gums in painful teething; that is, if effectually done, and the skin of the tooth be divided.

2517. Though teething is a natural function, and to an infant in perfect health should be unproductive
of pain, yet in general it is not only a fertile cause of suffering, but often a source of
alarm and danger; the former, from irritation in the stomach and bowels, deranging the whole
economy of the system, and the latter, from coma and fits, that may excite alarm in severe
cases; and the danger, that eventuates in some instances, from organic disease of the head
or spinal marrow.

2518. We shall say nothing in this place of "rickets," or "water on the head," which are frequent
results of dental irritation, but proceed to finish our remarks on the treatment of teething.
Though strongly advocating the lancing of the gums in teething, and when there are any severe
head-symptoms, yet it should never be needlessly done, or before being satisfied that the tooth
is fully formed, and is out of the socket, and under the gum. When assured on these points,
the gum should be cut lengthwise, and from the top of the gum downwards to the tooth, in an
horizontal direction, thus----, and for about half an inch in length. The operation is then
to be repeated in a transverse direction, cutting across the gum, in the centre of the first
incision, and forming a cross, thus +. The object of this double incision is to insure a retraction
of the cut parts, and leave an open way for the tooth to start from--an advantage not to be
obtained when only one incision is made; for unless the tooth immediately follows the lancing,
the opening reunites, and the operation has to be repeated. That this operation is very little
or not at all painful, is evidenced by the suddenness with which the infant falls asleep after
the lancing, and awakes in apparently perfect health, though immediately before the use of
the gum-lancet, the child may have been shrieking or in convulsions.

Convulsions, or Infantine Fits.

2519. From their birth till after teething, infants are more or less subject or liable to sudden
fits, which often, without any assignable cause, will attack the child in a moment, and while
in the mother's arms; and which, according to their frequency, and the age and strength of
the infant, are either slight or dangerous.

2520. Whatever may have been the remote cause, the immediate one is some irritation of the
nervous system, causing convulsions, or an effusion to the head, inducing coma. In the first
instance, the infant cries out with a quick, short scream, rolls up its eyes, arches its body
backwards, its arms become bent and fixed, and the fingers parted; the lips and eyelids assume
a dusky leaden colour, while the face remains pale, and the eyes open, glassy, or staring.
This condition may or may not be attended with muscular twitchings of the mouth, and convulsive
plunges of the arms. The fit generally lasts from one to three minutes, when the child recovers
with a sigh, and the relaxation of the body. In the other case, the infant is attacked at once
with total insensibility and relaxation of the limbs, coldness of the body and suppressed breathing;
the eyes, when open, being dilated, and presenting a dim glistening appearance; the infant
appearing, for the moment, to be dead.

2521. Treatment.-The first step in either case is, to immerse the child in a hot bath up to
the chin; or if sufficient hot water cannot be procured to cover the body, make a hip-bath
of what can be obtained; and, while the left hand supports the child in a sitting or recumbent
position, with the right scoop up the water, and run it over the chest of the patient. When
sufficient water can be obtained, the spine should be briskly rubbed while in the bath; when
this cannot be done, lay the child on the knees, and with the fingers dipped in brandy, rub
the whole length of the spine vigorously for two or three minutes, and when restored to consciousness,
give occasionally a teaspoonful of weak brandy and water or wine and water.

2522. An hour after the bath, it may be necessary to give an aperient powder, possibly also
to repeat the dose for once or twice every three hours; in which case the following prescription
is to be employed. Take of

  Powdered scammony       6 grains.
  Grey powder             6 grains.
  Antimonial powder       4 grains.
  Lump sugar             20 grains.

Mix thoroughly, and divide into three powders, which are to be taken as advised for an infant
one year old; for younger or weakly infants, divide into four powders, and give as the other.
For thirst and febrile symptoms, give drinks of barley-water, or cold water, and every three
hours put ten to fifteen drops of spirits of sweet nitre in a dessert-spoonful of either beverage.

THRUSH, AND ITS TREATMENT.

2523. This is a disease to which infants are peculiarly subject, and in whom alone it may be
said to be a disease; for when thrush shows itself in adult or advanced life, it is not as
a disease proper, but only as a symptom, or accessory, of some other ailment, generally of
a chronic character, and should no more be classed as a separate affection than the petechae,
or dark-coloured spots that appear in malignant measles, may be considered a distinct affection.

2524. Thrush is a disease of the follicles of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal,
whereby there are formed small vesicles, or bladders, filled with a thick mucous secretion,
which, bursting, discharge their contents, and form minute ulcers in the centre of each vessel.
To make this formal but unavoidable description intelligible, we must beg the reader's patience
while we briefly explain terms that may appear to many so unmeaning, and make the pathology
of thrush fully familiar.

2525. The whole digestive canal, of which the stomach and bowels are only a part, is covered,
from the lips, eyes, and ears downwards, with a thin glairy tissue, like the skin that lines
the inside of an egg, called the mucous membrane; this membrane is dotted all over, in a state
of health, by imperceptible points, called follicles, through which the saliva, or mucous secreted
by the membrane, is poured out.

2526. These follicles, or little glands, then, becoming enlarged, and filled with a congealed
fluid, constitute thrush in its first stage; and when the child's lips and mouth appear a mass
of small pearls, then, as these break and discharge, the second stage, or that of ulceration,
sets in.

2527. Symptoms.--Thrush is generally preceded by considerable irritation, by the child crying
and fretting, showing more than ordinary redness of the lips and nostrils, hot fetid breath,
with relaxed bowels, and dark feculent evacuations; the water is scanty and high-coloured;
whilst considerable difficulty in swallowing, and much thirst, are the other symptoms, which
a careful observation of the little patient makes manifest.

2528. The situation and character of thrush show at once that the cause is some irritation
of the mucous membrane, and can proceed only from the nature and quality of the food. Before
weaning, this must be looked for in the mother, and the condition of the milk; after that time,
in the crude and indigestible nature of the food given. In either case, this exciting cause
of the disease must be at once stopped. When it proceeds from the mother, it is always best
to begin by physicking the infant through the parent; that is to say, let the parent first
take the medicine, which will sufficiently affect the child through the milk: this plan has
the double object of benefiting the patient and, at the same time, correcting the state of
the mother, and improving the condition of her milk. In the other case, when the child is being
fed by hand, then proceed by totally altering the style of aliment given, and substituting
farinaceous food, custards, blanc-mange, and ground-rice puddings.

2529. As an aperient medicine for the mother, the best thing she can take is a dessert-spoonful
of carbonate of magnesia once or twice a day, in a cup of cold water; and every second day,
for two or three times, an aperient pill.

2530. As the thrush extends all over the mouth, throat, stomach, and bowels, the irritation
to the child from such an extent of diseased surface is proportionately great, and before attempting
to act on such a tender surface by opening medicine, the better plan is to soothe by an emollient
mixture; and, for that purpose, let the following be prepared. Take of

  Castor oil                          2 drachms.
  Sugar                               1 drachm.
  Mucilage, or powdered gum Arabic    half a drachm.

Triturate till the oil is incorporated, then add slowly--

  Mint-water            One ounce and a half
  Laudanum              Ten drops

Half a teaspoonful three times a day, to an infant from one to two years old; a teaspoonful
from two to three years old; and a dessertspoonful at any age over that time. After two days'
use of the mixture, one of the following powders should be given twice a day, accompanied with
one dose daily of the mixture:--

  Grey powder              20 grains.
  Powdered rhubarb         15 grains.
  Scammony                 10 grains. Mix.

Divide into twelve powders, for one year; eight powders, from one to two; and six powders,
from two to six years old. After that age, double the strength, by giving the quantity of two
powders at once.

2531. It is sometimes customary to apply borax and honey to the mouth for thrush; but it is
always better to treat the disease constitutionally rather than locally. The first steps, therefore,
to be adopted are, to remove or correct the exciting cause--the mother's milk or food; allay
irritation by a warm bath and the castor-oil mixture, followed by and conjoined with the powders.

2532. To those, however, who wish to try the honey process, the best preparation to use is
the following:-Rub down one ounce of honey with two drachms of tincture of myrrh, and apply
it to the lips and mouth every four or six hours.

2533. It is a popular belief, and one most devoutly cherished by many nurses and elderly persons,
that everybody must, at some time of their life, between birth and death, have an attack of
thrush, and if not in infancy, or prime of life, it will surely attack them on their death-bed,
in a form more malignant than if the patient had been affected with the malady earlier; the
black thrush with which they are then reported to be affected being, in all probability, the
petechae or purple spots that characterize the worst form, and often the last stage, of typhoid
fever.

2534. In general, very little medicine is needed in this disease of the thrush--an alterative
powder, or a little magnesia, given once or twice, being all, with the warm bath, that, in
the great majority of cases, is needed to restore the mucous membrane to health. As thrush
is caused by an excess of heat, or over-action in the lining membrane of the stomach and bowels,
whatever will counteract this state, by throwing the heat on the surface, must materially benefit,
if not cure, the disease: and that means every mother has at hand, in the form of a warm bath.
After the application of this, a little magnesia to correct the acidity existing along the
surface of the mucous membrane, is often all that is needed to throw the system into such a
state as will effect its own cure. This favourable state is indicated by an excessive flow
of saliva, or what is called "dribbling," and by a considerable amount of relaxation of the
bowels-a condition that must not be mistaken for diarrhoea, and checked as if a disease, but
rather, for the day or two it continues, encouraged as a critical evacuant.

2535. Should there be much debility in the convalescence, half a teaspoonful of stee wine,
given twice a day in a little barley-water, will be found sufficient for all the purposes of
a tonic. This, with the precaution of changing the child's food, or, when it lives on the mother,
of correcting the quality of the milk by changing her own diet, and, by means of an antacid
or aperient, improving the state of the secretion. Such is all the treatment that this disease
in general requires.

2536. The class of diseases we are now approaching are the most important, both in their pathological
features and in their consequences on the constitution, of any group or individual disease
that assails the human body; and though more frequently attacking the undeveloped frame of
childhood, are yet by no means confined to that period. These are called Eruptive Fevers, and
embrace chicken-pox, cow-pox, small-pox, scarlet fever, measles, milary fever, and erysipelas,
or St. Anthony's fire.

2537. The general character of all these is, that they are contagious, and, as a general rule,
attack a person only once in his lifetime; that their chain of diseased actions always begins
with fever, and that, after an interval of from one to four days, the fever is followed by
an eruption of the skin.

CHICKEN-POX, OR GLASS-POX; AND COW-POX, OR VACCINATION.

2538. CHICKEN-POX, or GLASS-POX, may, in strict propriety, be classed as a mild variety of
small-pox, presenting all the mitigated symptoms of that formidable disease. Among many physicians
it is, indeed, classed as small-pox, and not a separate disease; but as this is not the place
to discuss such questions, and as we profess to give only facts, the result of our own practical
experience, we shall treat this affection of glass-pox or chicken-pox, as we ourselves have
found it, as a distinct and separate disease.

2539. Chicken-pox is marked by all the febrile symptoms presented by small-pox, with this difference,
that, in the case of chicken-pox, each symptom is particularly slight. The heat of body is
much less acute, and the principal symptoms are difficulty of breathing, headache, coated tongue,
and nausea, which sometimes amounts to vomiting. After a term of general irritability, heat,
and restlessness, about the fourth day, or between the third and fourth, an eruption makes
its appearance over the face, neck, and body, in its first two stages closely resembling small-pox,
with this especial difference, that whereas the pustules in small-pox have flat and depressed
centres--an infallible characteristic of small-pox--the pustules in chicken-pox remain globular,
while the fluid in them changes from a transparent white to a straw-coloured liquid, which
begins to exude and disappear about the eighth or ninth day, and, in mild cases, by the twelfth
desquamates, or peels off entirely.

2540. There can be no doubt that chicken-pox, like small-pox, is contagious, and under certain
states of the atmosphere becomes endemic. Parents should, therefore, avoid exposing young children
to the danger of infection by taking them where it is known to exist, as chicken-pox, in weakly
constitutions, or in very young children, may superinduce small-pox, the one disease either
running concurrently with the other, or discovering itself as the other declines. This, of
course, is a condition that renders the case very hazardous, as the child has to struggle against
two diseases at once, or before it has recruited strength from the attack of the first.

2541. Treatment.--In all ordinary cases of chicken-pox--and it is very seldom it assumes any
complexity--the whole treatment resolves itself into the use of the warm bath, and a course
of gentle aperients. The bath should be used when the oppression of the lungs renders the breathing
difficult, or the heat and dryness of the skin, with the undeveloped rash beneath the surface,
shows the necessity for its use.

2542. As the pustules in chicken-pox very rarely run to the state of suppuration, as in the
other disease, there is no fear of pitting or disfigurement, except in very severe forms, which,
however, happen so seldom as not to merit apprehension. When the eruption subsides, however,
the face may be washed with elder-flower water, and the routine followed which is prescribed
in the convalescent state of small-pox.

2543. COW-POX, properly speaking, is an artificial disease, established in a healthy body as
a prophylactic, or preventive agent, against the more serious attack of small-pox, and is merely
that chain of slight febrile symptoms and local irritation, consequent on the specific action
of the lymph of the vaccination, in its action on the circulating system of the body. This
is not the place to speak of the benefits conferred on mankind by the discovery of vaccination,
not only as the preserver of the human features from a most loathsome disfigurement, but as
a sanitary agent in the prolongation of life.

2544. Fortunately the State has now made it imperative on all parents to have their children
vaccinated before, or by the end of, the twelfth week; thus doing away, as far as possible,
with the danger to public health proceeding from the ignorance or prejudice of those parents
whose want of information on the subject makes them object to the employment of this specific
preventive; for though vaccination has been proved not to be always an infallible guard against
small-pox, the attack is always much lighter, should it occur, and is seldom, if indeed ever,
fatal after the precaution of vaccination. The best time to vaccinate a child is after the
sixth and before the twelfth week, if it is in perfect health, but still earlier if small-pox
is prevalent, and any danger exists of the infant taking the disease. It is customary, and
always advisable, to give the child a mild aperient powder one or two days before inserting
the lymph in the arm; and should measles, scarlet fever, or any other disease arise during
the progress of the pustule, the child, when recovered, should be re-vaccinated, and the lymph
taken from its arm on no account used for vaccinating purposes.

2545. The disease of cow-pox generally takes twenty days to complete its course; in other words,
the maturity and declension of the pustule takes that time to fulfil its several changes. The
mode of vaccination is either to insert the matter, or lymph, taken from a healthy child, under
the cuticle in several places on both arms, or, which is still better, to make three slight
scratches, or abrasions, with a lancet on one arm in this manner, ,,",, and work into the irritated
parts the lymph, allowing the arm to dry thoroughly before putting down the infant's sleeve;
by this means absorption is insured, and the unnecessary pain of several pustules on both arms
avoided. No apparent change is observable by the eye for several days; indeed, not till the
fourth, in many cases, is there any evidence of a vesicle; about the fifth day, however, a
pink areola, or circle, is observed round one or all of the places, surrounding a small pearly
vesicle or bladder. This goes on deepening in hue till the seventh or eighth day, when the
vesicle is about an inch in diameter, with a depressed centre; on the ninth the edges are elevated,
and the surrounding part hard and inflamed. The disease is now at its height, and the pustule
should be opened, if not for the purpose of vaccinating other children, to allow the escape
of the lymph, and subdue the inflammatory action. After the twelfth day the centre is covered
by a brown scab, and the colour of the swelling becomes darker, gradually declining in hardness
and colour till the twentieth, when the scab falls, off, leaving a small pit, or cicatrix,
to mark the seat of the disease, and for life prove a certificate of successful vaccination.

2546. In some children the inflammation and swelling of the arm is excessive, and extremely
painful, and the fever, about the ninth or tenth day, very high; the pustule, therefore, at
that time, should sometimes be opened, the arm fomented every two hours with a warm bread poultice,
and an aperient powder given to the infant.

MEASLES AND SCARLET FEVER, WITH THE TREATMENT OF BOTH.

Measles.

2547. This much-dreaded disease, which forms the next subject in our series of infantine diseases,
and which entails more evils on the health of childhood than any other description of physical
suffering to which that age of life is subject, may be considered more an affection of the
venous circulation, tending to general and local congestion, attended with a diseased condition
of the blood, than either as a fever or an inflammation; and though generally classed before
or after scarlet fever, is, in its pathology and treatment, irrespective of its after-consequences,
as distinct and opposite as one disease can well be from another.

4548. As we have already observed, measles are always characterized by the running at the nose
and eyes, and great oppression of breathing; so, in the mode of treatment, two objects are
to be held especially in view; first, to unload the congested state of the lungs,--the cause
of the oppressed breathing; and, secondly, to act vigorously, both during the disease and afterwards,
on the bowels. At the same time it cannot be too strongly borne in mind, that though the patient
in measles should on no account be kept unduly hot, more care than in most infantine complaints
should be taken to guard the body from cold, or any abrupt changes of temperature. With these
special observations, we shall proceed to give a description of the disease, as recognized
by its usual--

2549. Symptoms, which commence with cold chills and flushes, lassitude, heaviness, pain in
the head, and drowsiness, cough, hoarseness, and extreme difficulty of breathing, frequent
sneezing, deduction or running at the eyes and nose, nausea, sometimes vomiting, thirst, a
furred tongue; the pulse throughout is quick, and sometimes full and soft, at others hard and
small, with other indications of an inflammatory nature.

2550. On the third day, small red points make their appearance, first on the face and neck,
gradually extending over the upper and lower part of the body. On the fifth day, the vivid
red of the eruption changes into a brownish hue; and, in two or three days more, the rash entirely
disappears, leaving a loose powdery desquamation on the skin, which rubs off like dandriff.
At this stage of the disease a diarrhoea frequently comes on, which, being what is called "critical,"
should never be checked, unless seriously severe. Measles sometimes assume a typhoid or malignant
character, in which form the symptoms are all greatly exaggerated, and the case from the first
becomes both doubtful and dangerous. In this condition the eruption comes out sooner, and only
in patches; and often, after showing for a few hours, suddenly recedes, presenting, instead
of the usual florid red, a dark purple or blackish hue; a dark brown fur forms on the gums
and mouth, the breathing becomes laborious, delirium supervenes, and, if unrelieved, is followed
by coma; a fetid diarrhoea takes place, and the patient sinks under the congested state of
the lungs and the oppressed functions of the brain.

2551. The unfavourable symptoms in measles are a high degree of fever, the excessive heat and
dryness of the skin, hurried and short breathing, and a particularly hard pulse. The sequels,
or after-consequences, of measles are, croup, bronchitis, mesenteric disease, abscesses behind
the ear, ophthalmia, and glandular swellings in other parts of the body.

2552. Treatment.--In the first place, the patient should be kept in a cool room, the temperature
of which must be regulated to suit the child's feelings of comfort, and the diet adapted to
the strictest principles of abstinence. When the inflammatory symptoms are severe, bleeding,
in some form, is often necessary, though, when adopted, it must be in the first stage of the
disease; and, if the lungs are the apprehended seat of the inflammation, two or more leeches,
according to the age and strength of the patient, must be applied to the upper part of the
chest, followed by a small blister; or the blister may be substituted for the leeches, the
attendant bearing in mind, that the benefit effected by the blister can always be considerably
augmented by plunging the feet into very hot water about a couple of hours after applying the
blister, and kept in the water for about two minutes. And let it further be remembered, that
this immersion of the feet in hot water may be adopted at any time or stage of the disease;
and that, whenever the head or lungs are oppressed, relief will always accrue from its sudden
and brief employment. When the symptoms commence with much shivering, and the skin early assumes
a hot, dry character, the appearance of the rash will be facilitated, and all the other symptoms
rendered milder, if the patient is put into a warm bath, and kept in the water for about three
minutes. Or, where that is not convenient, the following process, which will answer quite as
well, can be substituted:--Stand the child, naked, in a tub, and, having first prepared several
jugs of sufficiently warm water, empty them, in quick succession, over the patient's shoulders
and body; immediately wrap in a hot blanket, and put the child to bed till it rouses from the
sleep that always follows the effusion or bath. This agent, by lowering the temperature of
the skin, and opening the pores, producing a natural perspiration, and unloading the congested
state of the lungs, in most cases does away entirely with the necessity both for leeches and
a blister. Whether any of these external means have been employed or not, the first internal
remedies should commence with a series of aperient powders and a saline mixture, as prescribed
in the following formularies; at the same time, as a beverage to quench the thirst, let a quantity
of barley-water be made, slightly acidulated by the juice of an orange, and partially sweetened
by some sugar-candy; and of which, when properly made and cold, let the patient drink as often
as thirst, or the dryness of the mouth, renders necessary.

2553. Aperient Powders.--Take of scammony and jalap, each 24 grains; grey powder and powdered
antimony, each 18 grains. Mix and divide into 12 powders, if for a child between two and four
years of age; into 8 powders, if for a child between four and eight years of ago; and into
6 powders for between eight and twelve years. One powder to be given, in a little jelly or
sugar-and-water, every three or four hours, according to the severity of the symptoms.

2554. Saline Mixture.--Take of mint-water, 6 ounces; powdered nitre, 20 grains; antimonial
wine, 3 drachms; spirits of nitre, 2 drachms; syrup of saffron, 2 drachms. Mix. To children
under three years, give a teaspoonful every two hours; from that age to six, a dessertspoonful
at the same times; and a tablespoonful every three or four hours to children between six and
twelve.

2555. The object of these aperient powders is to keep up a steady but gentle action on the
bowels; but, whenever it seems necessary to administer a stronger dose, and effect a brisk
action on the digestive organs,--a course particularly imperative towards the close of the
disease,--two of these powders given at once, according to the age, will be found to produce
that effect; that is, two of the twelve for a child under four years, and two of the eight,
and two of the six, according to the age of the patient.

2556. When the difficulty of breathing becomes oppressive, as it generally does towards night,
a hot bran poultice, laid on the chest, will be always found highly beneficial. The diet throughout
must be light, and consist of farinaceous food, such as rice and sago puddings, beef-tea and
toast; and not till convalescence sets in should hard or animal food be given.

2557. When measles assume the malignant form, the advice just given must be broken through;
food of a nutritious and stimulating character should be at once substituted, and administered
in conjunction with wine, and even spirits, and the disease regarded and treated as a case
of typhus. But, as this form of measles is not frequent, and, if occurring, hardly likely to
be treated without assistance, it is unnecessary to enter on the minutiae of its practice here.
What we have prescribed, in almost all cases, will be found sufficient to meet every emergency,
without resorting to a multiplicity of agents.

2558. The great point to remember in measles is, not to give up the treatment with the apparent
subsidence of the disease, as the after-consequences of measles are too often more serious,
and to be more dreaded, than the measles themselves. To guard against this danger, and thoroughly
purify the system, after the subsidence of all the symptoms of the disease, a corrective course
of medicine, and a regimen of exercise, should be adopted for some weeks after the cure of
the disease. To effect this, an active aperient powder should be given every three or four
clays, with a daily dose of the subjoined tonic mixture, with as much exercise, by walking,
running after a hoop, or other bodily exertion, as the strength of the child and the state
of the atmosphere will admit, the patient being, wherever possible, removed to a purer air
as soon as convalescence warrants the change.

2559. Tonic Mixture.--Take of infusion of rose-leaves, 6 ounces; quinine, 8 grains; diluted
sulphuric acid, 15 drops. Mix. Dose, from half a teaspoonful up to a dessertspoonful, once
a day, according to the ago of the patient.

Scarlatina, or Scarlet Fever.

2560. Though professional accuracy has divided this disease into several forms, we shall keep
to the one disease most generally mot with, the common or simple scarlet fever, which, in all
cases, is characterized by an excessive heat on the skin, sore throat, and a peculiar speckled
appearance of the tongue.

2561. Symptoms.--Cold chills, shivering, nausea, thirst, hot skin, quick pulse, with difficulty
of swallowing; the tongue is coated, presenting through its fur innumerable specks, the elevated
papillae of the tongue, which gives it the speckled character, that, if not the invariable
sign of scarlet fever, is only met with in cases closely analogous to that disease. Between
the second and third day, but most frequently on the third, a bright red efflorescence breaks
out in patches on the face, neck, and back, from which it extends over the trunk and extremities,
always showing thicker and deeper in colour wherever there is any pressure, such as the elbows,
back, and hips; when the eruption is well out, the skin presents the appearance of a boiled
lobster-shell. At first, the skin is smooth, but, as the disease advances, perceptible roughness
is apparent, from the elevation of the rash, or, more properly, the pores of the skin. On the
fifth and sixth days the eruption begins to decline, and by the eighth has generally entirely
disappeared. During the whole of this period, there is, more or less, constant sore throat.

2562. The Treatment of scarlet fever is, in general, very simple. Where the heat is great,
and the eruption comes out with difficulty, or recedes as soon as it appears, the body should
be sponged with cold vinegar-and-water, or tepid water, as in measles, poured over the chest
and body, the patient being, as in that disease, wrapped in a blanket and put to bed, and the
same powders and mixture ordered in measles administered, with the addition of a constant hot
bran poultice round the throat, which should be continued from the first symptom till a day
or two after the declension of the rash. The same low diet and cooling drink, with the same
general instructions, are to be obeyed in this as in the former disease.

2563. When the fever runs high in the first stage, and there is much nausea, before employing
the effusions of water, give the patient an emetic, of equal, parts of ipecacuanha and antimonial
wine, in doses of from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful, according to age. By these means,
nine out of every ten cases of scarlatina may be safely and expeditiously cured, especially
if the temperature of the patient's room is kept at an even standard of about sixty degrees.

HOOPING-COUGH, CROUP, AND DIARRHOEA, WITH THEIR MODE OF TREATMENT.

Hooping-Cough.

2564. THIS is purely a spasmodic disease, and is only infectious through the faculty of imitation,
a habit that all children are remarkably apt to fall into; and even where adults have contracted
hooping-cough, it has been from the same cause, and is as readily accounted for, on the principle
of imitation, as that the gaping of one person will excite or predispose a whole party to follow
the same spasmodic example. If any one associates for a few days with a person who stammers
badly, he will find, when released from his company, that the sequence of his articulation
and the fluency of his speech are, for a time, gone; and it will be a matter of constant vigilance,
and some difficulty, to overcome the evil of so short an association. The manner in which a
number of school-girls will, one after another, fall into a fit on beholding one of their number
attacked with epilepsy, must be familiar to many. These several facts lead us to a juster notion
of how to treat this spasmodic disease. Every effort should, therefore, be directed, mentally
and physically, to break the chain of nervous action, on which the continuance of the cough
depends.

2565. Symptoms.--Hooping-cough comes on with a slight oppression of breathing, thirst, quick
pulse, hoarseness, and a hard, dry cough. This state may exist without any change from one
to two or three weeks before the peculiar feature of the disease-the hoop-sets in. As the characteristics
of this cough are known to all, it is unnecessary to enter here, physiologically, on the subject.
We shall, therefore, merely remark that the frequent vomiting and bleeding at the mouth or
nose are favourable signs, and proceed to the

2566. Treatment, which should consist in keeping up a state of nausea and vomiting. For this
purpose, give the child doses of ipecacuanha and antimonial wines, in equal parts, and quantities
varying from half to one and a half teaspoonful once a day, or, when the expectoration is hard
and difficult of expulsion, giving the following cough mixture every four hours. Take of

  Syrup of squills            1/2 ounce.
  Antimonial wine               1 ounce.
  Laudanum                     15 drops.
  Syrup of Toulou             2 drachms.
  Water                     1-1/2 ounce.

Mix. The dose is from half a spoonful to a dessertspoonful. When the cough is urgent, the warm
bath is to be used, and either one or two leeches applied over the breastbone, or else a small
blister laid on the lower part of the throat.
