But, though the path was pleasant, nay, exhilarating and stimulating, I must confess to the
fact that I have had no psychological experiences, regrets, or disillusionments. I have had
no temptation to write as to the shortness and precariousness of human existence, or to reflect
how base I had found mankind, or, again, to deplore the past, curse the present, and dread
the future. Life to me, in looking back, seems on the whole a very natural and simple show.
No one, in one sense, feels more strongly than I do that we are being swept along by the mighty
current of a vast river, without any clearer indication of what is the outlet of the river
than of what is its source. But though these things may be an excuse for a great deal of rhetoric,
they somehow seem to me, if I may use the word again, natural and non-inflammatory. It is far
easier to trust what those who, liking the vagueness of theology, call "the larger hope," but
which I should be content to call plainly the mercy of God--a mercy which I, for one, make
bold to say I would rather have uncovenanted than covenanted. Covenanted mercies are a kind
of thing which may do very well at an insurance office or for business purposes, but they are
not the mercies one would ever dream of asking for or accepting from an earthly father. Then
how can one dare to speak of them in the same breath with God?

"But this," I hear some readers say, "is the illusion of faith and has nothing of the permanence
of fact." Well, I, for one, am content to rest on faith, honest and instinctive. Faith, to
my mind, is a fact and a very palpable fact,--a fact as vital as any of the other great incommensurables
and insolubles of our existence.

If I am asked to treat of the river, or rather, the ocean of life and the adventure of its
voyage in terms that will satisfy those not fortunate enough to have faith, let me commend
to them that memorable dream set forth by that most honest and exact of agnostics as of jurists,
Mr. Justice Stephen. The dream, published some fifty years ago, is as noble a piece of literature
as it is a monument of intellectual insight.

I dreamt [he says, after Bunyan's fashion] that I was in the cabin of a ship, handsomely furnished
and lighted. A number of people were expounding the objects of the voyage and the principles
of navigation. They were contradicting each other eagerly, but each maintained that the success
of the voyage depended absolutely upon the adoption of his own plan. The charts to which they
appealed were in many places confused and contradictory. They said that they were proclaiming
the best of news, but the substance of it was that when we reached port most of us would be
thrown into a dungeon and put to death by lingering torments. Some, indeed, would receive different
treatment; but they could not say why, though all agreed in extolling the wisdom and mercy
of the Sovereign of the country. Saddened and confused I escaped to the deck, and found myself
somehow enrolled in the crew. The prospect was unlike the accounts given in the cabin. There
was no sun; we had but a faint starlight, and there were occasionally glimpses of land and
of what might be lights on shore, which yet were pronounced by some of the crew to be mere
illusions. They held that the best thing to be done was to let the ship drive as she would,
without trying to keep her on what was understood to be her course. For the strangest thing
on that strange ship was the fact that there was such a course. Many theories were offered
about this, none quite satisfactory; but it was understood that the ship was to be steered
due north. The best and bravest and wisest of the crew would dare the most terrible dangers,
even, from their comrades, to keep her on her course. Putting these things together, and noting
that the ship was obviously framed and equipped for the voyage, I could not help feeling that
there was a port somewhere, though I doubted the wisdom of those who professed to know all
about it. I resolved to do my duty, in the hope that it would turn out to have been my duty,
and I then felt that there was something bracing in the mystery by which we were surrounded,
and that, at all events, ignorance honestly admitted and courageously faced, and rough duty
vigorously done, was far better than the sham knowledge and the bitter quarrels of the sickly
cabin and glaring lamplight from which I had escaped.

Was there ever a nobler parable more nobly expressed? It may well end the last page of the
last chapter of The Adventure of Living.
