"THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU" CHRISTIANITY NOT AS A MYSTIC RELIGION BUT AS A NEW THEORY
OF LIFE

TRANSLATED FROM THE RUSSIAN OF COUNT LEO TOLSTOI BY CONSTANCE GARNETT New York, 1894

TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

The book I have had the privilege of translating is, undoubtedly, one of the most remarkable
studies of the social and psychological condition of the modern world which has appeared in
Europe for many years, and its influence is sure to be lasting and far reaching.  Tolstoi's
genius is beyond dispute.  The verdict of the civilized world has pronounced him as perhaps
the greatest novelist of our generation.  But the philosophical and religious works of his
later years have met with a somewhat indifferent reception.  They have been much talked about,
simply because they were his work, but, as Tolstoi himself complains, they have never been
seriously discussed.  I hardly think that he will have to repeat the complaint in regard to
the present volume.  One may disagree with his views, but no one can seriously deny the originality,
boldness, and depth of the social conception which he develops with such powerful logic.  The
novelist has shown in this book the religious fervor and spiritual insight of the prophet;
yet one is pleased to recognize that the artist is not wholly lost in the thinker.  The subtle
intuitive perception of the psychological basis of the social position, the analysis of the
frame of mind of oppressors and oppressed, and of the intoxication of Authority and Servility,
as well as the purely descriptive passages in the last chapter--these could only have come
from the author of "War and Peace."

The book will surely give all classes of readers much to think of, and must call forth much
criticism.  It must be refuted by those who disapprove of its teaching, if they do not want
it to have great influence.

One cannot of course anticipate that English people, slow as they are to be influenced by ideas,
and instinctively distrustful of all that is logical, will take a leap in the dark and attempt
to put Tolstoi's theory of life into practice.  But one may at least be sure that his destructive
criticism of the present social and political REGIME will become a powerful force in the work
of disintegration and social reconstruction which is going on around us.  Many earnest thinkers
who, like Tolstoi, are struggling to find their way out of the contradictions of our social
order will hail him as their spiritual guide.  The individuality of the author is felt in every
line of his work, and even the most prejudiced cannot resist the fascination of his genuineness,
sincerity, and profound earnestness.  Whatever comes from a heart such as his, swelling with
anger and pity at the sufferings of humanity, cannot fail to reach the hearts of others.  No
reader can put down the book without feeling himself better and more truth-loving for having
read it.

Many readers may be disappointed with the opening chapters of the book.  Tolstoi disdains all
attempt to captivate the reader.  He begins by laying what he considers to be the logical foundation
of his doctrines, stringing together quotations from little-known theological writers, and
he keeps his own incisive logic for the later part of the book.

One word as to the translation.  Tolstoi's style in his religious and philosophical works differs
considerably from that of his novels.  He no longer cares about the form of his work, and his
style is often slipshod, involved, and diffuse.  It has been my aim to give a faithful reproduction
of the original.

CONSTANCE GARNETT. January,1894

PREFACE.

In the year 1884 I wrote a book under the title "What I Believe," in which I did in fact make
a sincere statement of my beliefs.

In affirming my belief in Christ's teaching, I could not help explaining why I do not believe,
and consider as mistaken, the Church's doctrine, which is usually called Christianity.

Among the many points in which this doctrine falls short of the doctrine of Christ I pointed
out as the principal one the absence of any commandment of non-resistance to evil by force.
The perversion of Christ's teaching by the teaching of the Church is more clearly apparent
in this than in any other point of difference.

I know--as we all do--very little of the practice and the spoken and written doctrine of former
times on the subject of non- resistance to evil.  I knew what had been said on the subject
by the fathers of the Church--Origen, Tertullian, and others--I knew too of the existence of
some so-called sects of Mennonites, Herrnhuters, and Quakers, who do not allow a Christian
the use of weapons, and do not enter military service; but I knew little of what had been done.
by these so-called sects toward expounding the question.

My book was, as I had anticipated, suppressed by the Russian censorship; but partly owing to
my literary reputation, partly because the book had excited people's curiosity, it circulated
in manuscript and in lithographed copies in Russia and through translations abroad, and it
evolved, on one side, from those who shared my convictions, a series of essays with a great
deal of information on the subject, on the other side a series of criticisms on the principles
laid down in my book.

A great deal was made clear to me by both hostile and sympathetic criticism, and also by the
historical events of late years; and I was led to fresh results and conclusions, which I wish
now to expound.

First I will speak of the information I received on the history of the question of non-resistance
to evil; then of the views of this question maintained by spiritual critics, that is, by professed
believers in the Christian religion, and also by temporal ones, that is, those who do not profess
the Christian religion; and lastly I will speak of the conclusions to which I have been brought
by all this in the light of the historical events of late years.

CHAPTER I.

THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HAS BEEN PROFESSED BY A MINORITY OF MEN FROM
THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY.

Of the Book "What I Believe"--The Correspondence Evoked by it-- Letters from Quakers--Garrison's
Declaration--Adin Ballou, his Works, his Catechism--Helchitsky's "Net of Faith"--The Attitude
of the World to Works Elucidating Christ's Teaching--Dymond's Book "On War"--Musser's "Non-resistance
Asserted"--Attitude of the Government in 1818 to Men who Refused to Serve in the Army --Hostile
Attitude of Governments Generally and of Liberals to Those who Refuse to Assist in Acts of
State Violence, and their Conscious Efforts to Silence and Suppress these Manifestations of
Christian Non-resistance.

Among the first responses some letters called forth by my book were some letters from American
Quakers.  In these letters, expressing their sympathy with my views on the unlawfulness for
a Christian of war and the use of force of any kind, the Quakers gave me details of their own
so-called sect, which for more than two hundred years has actually professed the teaching of
Christ on non-resistance to evil by force, and does not make use of weapons in self-defense.
The Quakers sent me books, from which I learnt how they had, years ago, established beyond
doubt the duty for a Christian of fulfilling the command of non-resistance to evil by force,
and had exposed the error of the Church's teaching in allowing war and capital punishment.

In a whole series of arguments and texts showing that war--that is, the wounding and killing
of men--is inconsistent with a religion founded on peace and good will toward men, the Quakers
maintain and prove that nothing has contributed so much to the obscuring of Christian truth
in the eyes of the heathen, and has hindered so much the diffusion of Christianity through
the world, as the disregard of this command by men calling themselves Christians, and the permission
of war and violence to Christians.

"Christ's teaching, which came to be known to men, not by means of violence and the sword,"
they say, "but by means of non-resistance to evil, gentleness, meekness, and peaceableness,
can only be diffused through the world by the example of peace, harmony, and love among its
followers."

"A Christian, according to the teaching of God himself, can act only peaceably toward all men,
and therefore there can be no authority able to force the Christian to act in opposition to
the teaching of God and to the principal virtue of the Christian in his relation with his neighbors."

"The law of state necessity," they say, "can force only those to change the law of God who,
for the sake of earthly gains, try to reconcile the irreconcilable; but for a Christian who
sincerely believes that following Christ's teaching will give him salvation, such considerations
of state can have no force."

Further acquaintance with the labors of the Quakers and their works--with Fox, Penn, and especially
the work of Dymond (published in 1827)--showed me not only that the impossibility of reconciling
Christianity with force and war had been recognized long, long ago, but that this irreconcilability
had been long ago proved so clearly and so indubitably that one could only wonder how this
impossible reconciliation of Christian teaching with the use of force, which has been, and
is still, preached in the churches, could have been maintained in spite of it.

In addition to what I learned from the Quakers I received about the same time, also from America,
some information on the subject from a source perfectly distinct and previously unknown to me.
