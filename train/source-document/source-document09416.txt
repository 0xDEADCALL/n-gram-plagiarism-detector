B.C. 411. To follow the order of events (1). A few days later Thymochares arrived from Athens
with a few ships, when another sea fight between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians at once took
place, in which the former, under the command of Agesandridas, gained the victory.

 (1) Lit. "after these events"; but is hard to conjecture to what
    events the author refers. For the order of events and the
    connection between the closing chapter of Thuc. viii. 109, and the
    opening words of the "Hellenica," see introductory remarks above.
    The scene of this sea-fight is, I think, the Hellespont.

Another short interval brings us to a morning in early winter, when Dorieus, the son of Diagoras,
was entering the Hellespont with fourteen ships from Rhodes at break of day. The Athenian day-watch
descrying him, signalled to the generals, and they, with twenty sail, put out to sea to attack
him. Dorieus made good his escape, and, as he shook himself free of the narrows, (2) ran his
triremes aground off Rhoeteum. When the Athenians had come to close quarters, the fighting
commenced, and was sustained at once from ships and shore, until at length the Athenians retired
to their main camp at Madytus, having achieved nothing.

 (2) Lit. "as he opened" {os enoige}. This is still a mariner's phrase
    in modern Greek, if I am rightly informed.

Meanwhile Mindarus, while sacrificing to Athena at Ilium, had observed the battle. He at once
hastened to the sea, and getting his own triremes afloat, sailed out to pick up the ships with
Dorieus. The Athenians on their side put out to meet him, and engaged him off Abydos. From
early morning till the afternoon the fight was kept up close to the shore. (3) Victory and
defeat hung still in even balance, when Alcibiades came sailing up with eighteen ships. Thereupon
the Peloponnesians fled towards Abydos, where, however, Pharnabazus brought them timely assistance.
(4) Mounted on horseback, he pushed forward into the sea as far as his horse would let him,
doing battle himself, and encouraging his troopers and the infantry alike to play their parts.
Then the Peloponnesians, ranging their ships in close-packed order, and drawing up their battle
line in proximity to the land, kept up the fight. At length the Athenians, having captured
thirty of the enemy's vessels without their crews, and having recovered those of their own
which they had previously lost, set sail for Sestos. Here the fleet, with the exception of
forty vessels, dispersed in different directions outside the Hellespont, to collect money;
while Thrasylus, one of the generals, sailed to Athens to report what had happened, and to
beg for a reinforcement of troops and ships. After the above incidents, Tissaphernes arrived
in the Hellespont, and received a visit from Alcibiades, who presented him with a single ship,
bringing with him tokens of friendship and gifts, whereupon Tissaphernes seized him and shut
him up in Sardis, giving out that the king's orders were to go to war with the Athenians. Thirty
days later Alcibiades, accompanied by Mantitheus, who had been captured in Caria, managed to
procure horses and escaped by night to Clazomenae.

 (3) The original has a somewhat more poetical ring. The author uses
    the old Attic or Ionic word {eona}. This is a mark of style, of
    which we shall have many instances. One might perhaps produce
    something of the effect here by translating: "the battle hugged
    the strand."

 (4) Or, "came to their aid along the shore."

B.C. 410. And now the Athenians at Sestos, hearing that Mindarus was meditating an attack upon
them with a squadron of sixty sail, gave him the slip, and under cover of night escaped to
Cardia. Hither also Alcibiades repaired from Clazomenae, having with him five triremes and
a light skiff; but on learning that the Peloponnesian fleet had left Abydos and was in full
sail for Cyzicus, he set off himself by land to Sestos, giving orders to the fleet to sail
round and join him there. Presently the vessels arrived, and he was on the point of putting
out to sea with everything ready for action, when Theramenes, with a fleet of twenty ships
from Macedonia, entered the port, and at the same instant Thrasybulus, with a second fleet
of twenty sail from Thasos, both squadrons having been engaged in collecting money. Bidding
these officers also follow him with all speed, as soon as they had taken out their large sails
and cleared for action, Alcibiades set sail himself for Parium. During the following night
the united squadron, consisting now of eighty-six vessels, stood out to sea from Parium, and
reached Proconnesus next morning, about the hour of breakfast. Here they learnt that Mindarus
was in Cyzicus, and that Pharnabazus, with a body of infantry, was with him. Accordingly they
waited the whole of this day at Proconnesus. On the following day Alcibiades summoned an assembly,
and addressing the men in terms of encouragement, warned them that a threefold service was
expected of them; that they must be ready for a sea fight, a land fight, and a wall fight all
at once, "for look you," said he, "we have no money, but the enemy has unlimited supplies from
the king."

Now, on the previous day, as soon as they were come to moorings, he had collected all the sea-going
craft of the island, big and little alike, under his own control, that no one might report
the number of his squadron to the enemy, and he had further caused a proclamation to be made,
that any one caught sailing across to the opposite coast would be punished with death. When
the meeting was over, he got his ships ready for action, and stood out to sea towards Cyzicus
in torrents of rain. Off Cyzicus the sky cleared, and the sun shone out and revealed to him
the spectacle of Mindarus's vessels, sixty in number, exercising at some distance from the
harbour, and, in fact, intercepted by himself. The Peloponnesians, perceiving at a glance the
greatly increased number of the Athenian galleys, and noting their proximity to the port, made
haste to reach the land, where they brought their vessels to anchor in a body, and prepared
to engage the enemy as he sailed to the attack. But Alcibiades, sailing round with twenty of
his vessels, came to land and disembarked. Seeing this, Mindarus also landed, and in the engagement
which ensued he fell fighting, whilst those who were with him took to flight. As for the enemy's
ships, the Athenians succeeded in capturing the whole of them (with the exception of the Syracusan
vessels, which were burnt by their crews), and made off with their prizes to Proconnesus. From
thence on the following day they sailed to attack Cyzicus. The men of that place, seeing that
the Peloponnesians and Pharnabazus had evacuated the town, admitted the Athenians. Here Alcibiades
remained twenty days, obtaining large sums of money from the Cyzicenes, but otherwise inflicting
no sort of mischief on the community. He then sailed back to Proconnesus, and from there to
Perinthus and Selybria. The inhabitants of the former place welcomed his troops into their
city, but the Selybrians preferred to give money, and so escape the admission of the troops.
Continuing the voyage the squadron reached Chrysopolis in Chalcedonia, (5) where they built
a fort, and established a custom-house to collect the tithe dues which they levied on all merchantmen
passing through the Straights from the Black Sea. Besides this, a detachment of thirty ships
was left there under the two generals, Theramenes and Eubulus, with instructions not only to
keep a look-out on the port itself and on all traders passing through the channel, but generally
to injure the enemy in any way which might present itself. This done, the rest of the generals
hastened back to the Hellespont.

 (5) This is the common spelling, but the coins of Calchedon have the
    letters {KALKH}, and so the name is written in the best MSS. of
    Herodotus, Xenophon, and other writers, by whom the place is
    named. See "Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog." "Chalcedon."

Now a despatch from Hippocrates, Mindarus's vice-admiral, (6) had been intercepted on its way
to Lacedaemon, and taken to Athens. It ran as follows (in broad Doric): (7) "Ships gone; Mindarus
dead; the men starving; at our wits' end what to do."

 (6) "Epistoleus," i.e. secretary or despatch writer, is the Spartan
    title of the officer second in command to the admiral.

 (7) Reading {'Errei ta kala} (Bergk's conjecture for {kala}) =
    "timbers," i.e. "ships" (a Doric word). Cf. Aristoph., "Lys."
    1253, {potta kala}. The despatch continues: {Mindaros apessoua}
    (al. {apessua}), which is much more racy than the simple word
    "dead." "M. is gone off." I cannot find the right English or
    "broad Scotch" equivalent. See Thirlwall, "Hist. Gr." IV. xxix. 88
    note.

Pharnabazus, however, was ready to meet with encouragement the despondency which afflicted
the whole Peloponnesian army and their allies. "As long as their own bodies were safe and sound,
why need they take to heart the loss of a few wooden hulls? Was there not timber enough and
to spare in the king's territory?" And so he presented each man with a cloak and maintenance
for a couple of months, after which he armed the sailors and formed them into a coastguard
for the security of his own seaboard.

He next called a meeting of the generals and trierarchs of the different States, and instructed
them to build just as many new ships in the dockyards of Antandrus as they had respectively
lost. He himself was to furnish the funds, and he gave them to understand that they might bring
down timber from Mount Ida. While the ships were building, the Syracusans helped the men of
Antandrus to finish a section of their walls, and were particularly pleasant on garrison duty;
and that is why the Syracusans to this day enjoy the privilege of citizenship, with the title
of "benefactors," at Antandrus. Having so arranged these matters, Pharnabazus proceeded at
once to the rescue of Chalcedon.

It was at this date that the Syracusan generals received news from home of their banishment
by the democratic party. Accordingly they called a meeting of their separate divisions, and
putting forward Hermocrates (8) as their spokesman, proceeded to deplore their misfortune,
insisting upon the injustice and the illegality of their banishment. "And now let us admonish
you," they added, "to be eager and willing in the future, even as in the past: whatever the
word of command may be, show yourselves good men and true: let not the memory of those glorious
sea fights fade. Think of those victories you have won, those ships you have captured by your
own unaided efforts; forget not that long list of achievements shared by yourselves with others,
in all which you proved yourselves invincible under our generalship. It was to a happy combination
of our merit and your enthusiasm, displayed alike on land and sea, that you owe the strength
and perfection of your discipline."

 (8) Hermocrates, the son of Hermon. We first hear of him in Thuc. iv.
    58 foll. as the chief agent in bringing the Sicilian States
    together in conference at Gela B.C. 424, with a view to healing
    their differences and combining to frustrate the dangerous designs
    of Athens. In 415 B.C., when the attack came, he was again the
    master spirit in rendering it abortive (Thuc. vi. 72 foll.) In 412
    B.C. it was he who urged the Sicilians to assist in completing the
    overthrow of Athens, by sending a squadron to co-operate with the
    Peloponnesian navy--for the relief of Miletus, etc. (Thuc. viii.
    26, 27 foll.) At a later date, in 411 B.C., when the Peloponnesian
    sailors were ready to mutiny, and "laid all their grievances to
    the charge of Astyochus (the Spartan admiral), who humoured
    Tissaphernes for his own gain" (Thuc. viii. 83), Hermocrates took
    the men's part, and so incurred the hatred of Tissaphernes.

With these words they called upon the men to choose other commanders, who should undertake
the duties of their office, until the arrival of their successors. Thereupon the whole assembly,
and more particularly the captains and masters of vessels and marines, insisted with loud cries
on their continuance in command. The generals replied, "It was not for them to indulge in faction
against the State, but rather it was their duty, in case any charges were forthcoming against
themselves, at once to render an account." When, however, no one had any kind of accusation
to prefer, they yielded to the general demand, and were content to await the arrival of their
successors. The names of these were--Demarchus, the son of Epidocus; Myscon, the son of Mencrates;
and Potamis, the son of Gnosis.

The captains, for their part, swore to restore the exiled generals as soon as they themselves
should return to Syracuse. At present with a general vote of thanks they despatched them to
their several destinations. It particular those who had enjoyed the society of Hermocrates
recalled his virtues with regret, his thoroughness and enthusiasm, his frankness and affability,
the care with which every morning and evening he was wont to gather in his quarters a group
of naval captains and mariners whose ability he recognised. These were his confidants, to whom
he communicated what he intended to say or do: they were his pupils, to whom he gave lessons
in oratory, now calling upon them to speak extempore, and now again after deliberation. By
these means Hermocrates had gained a wide reputation at the council board, where his mastery
of language was no less felt than the wisdom of his advice. Appearing at Lacedaemon as the
accuser of Tissaphernes, (9) he had carried his case, not only by the testimony of Astyochus,
but by the obvious sincerity of his statements, and on the strength of this reputation he now
betook himself to Pharnabazus. The latter did not wait to be asked, but at once gave him money,
which enabled him to collect friends and triremes, with a view to his ultimate recall to Syracuse.
Meanwhile the successors of the Syracusans had arrived at Miletus, where they took charge of
the ships and the army.

 (9) The matter referred to is fully explained Thuc. viii. 85.

It was at this same season that a revolution occurred in Thasos, involving the expulsion of
the philo-Laconian party, with the Laconian governor Eteonicus. The Laconian Pasippidas was
charged with having brought the business about in conjunction with Tissaphernes, and was banished
from Sparta in consequence. The naval force which he had been collecting from the allies was
handed over to Cratesippidas, who was sent out to take his place in Chios.

About the same period, while Thrasylus was still in Athens, Agis (10) made a foraging expedition
up to the very walls of the city. But Thrasylus led out the Athenians with the rest of the
inhabitants of the city, and drew them up by the side of the Lyceum Gymnasium, ready to engage
the enemy if they approached; seeing which, Agis beat a hasty retreat, not however without
the loss of some of his supports, a few of whom were cut down by the Athenian light troops.
This success disposed the citizens to take a still more favourable view of the objects for
which Thrasylus had come; and they passed a decree empowering him to call out a thousand hoplites,
one hundred cavalry, and fifty triremes.

 (10) The reader will recollect that we are giving in "the Deceleian"
    period of the war, 413-404 B.C. The Spartan king was in command of
    the fortress of Deceleia, only fourteen miles distant from Athens,
    and erected on a spot within sight of the city. See Thuc. vii. 19,
    27, 28.

Meanwhile Agis, as he looked out from Deceleia, and saw vessel after vessel laden with corn
running down to Piraeus, declared that it was useless for his troops to go on week after week
excluding the Athenians from their own land, while no one stopped the source of their corn
supply by sea: the best plan would be to send Clearchus, (11) the son of Rhamphius, who was
proxenos (12) of the Byzantines, to Chalcedon and Byzantium. The suggestion was approved, and
with fifteen vessels duly manned from Megara, or furnished by other allies, Clearchus set out.
These were troop-ships rather than swift-sailing men-of-war. Three of them, on reaching the
Hellespont, were destroyed by the Athenian ships employed to keep a sharp look-out on all merchant
craft in those waters. The other twelve escaped to Sestos, and thence finally reached Byzantium
in safety.

 (11) Of Clearchus we shall hear more in the sequel, and in the
    "Anabasis."

 (12) The Proxenus answered pretty nearly to our "Consul," "Agent,"
    "Resident"; but he differed in this respect, that he was always a
    member of the foreign State. An Athenian represented Sparta at
    Athens; a Laconian represented Athens at Sparta, and so forth. See
    Liddell and Scott.

So closed the year--a year notable also for the expedition against Sicily of the Carthaginians
under Hannibal with one hundred thousand men, and the capture, within three months, of the
two Hellenic cities of Selinus and Himera.

II

B.C. 409. Next year (1)... the Athenians fortified Thoricus; and Thrasylus, taking the vessels
lately voted him and five thousand of his seamen armed to serve as peltasts, (2) set sail for
Samos at the beginning of summer. At Samos he stayed three days, and then continued his voyage
to Pygela, where he proceeded to ravage the territory and attack the fortress. Presently a
detachment from Miletus came to the rescue of the men of Pygela, and attacking the scattered
bands of the Athenian light troops, put them to flight. But to the aid of the light troops
came the naval brigade of peltasts, with two companies of heavy infantry, and all but annihilated
the whole detachment from Miletus. They captured about two hundred shields, and set up a trophy.
Next day they sailed to Notium, and from Notium, after due preparation, marched upon Colophon.
The Colophonians capitulated without a blow. The following night they made an incursion into
Lydia, where the corn crops were ripe, and burnt several villages, and captured money, slaves,
and other booty in large quantity. But Stages, the Persian, who was employed in this neighbourhood,
fell in with a reinforcement of cavalry sent to protect the scattered pillaging parties from
the Athenian camp, whilst occupied with their individual plunder, and took one trooper prisoner,
killing seven others. After this Thrasylus led his troops back to the sea, intending to sail
to Ephesus. Meanwhile Tissaphernes, who had wind of this intention, began collecting a large
army and despatching cavalry with a summons to the inhabitants one and all to rally to the
defence of the goddess Artemis at Ephesus.

 (1) The MSS. here give a suspected passage, which may be rendered
    thus: "The first of Olympiad 93, celebrated as the year in which
    the newly-added two-horse race was won by Evagorias the Eleian,
    and the stadion (200 yards foot-race) by the Cyrenaean Eubotas,
    when Evarchippus was ephor at Sparta and Euctemon archon at
    Athens." But Ol. 93, to which these officers,and the addition of
    the new race at Olympia belong, is the year 408. We must therefore
    suppose either that this passage has been accidentally inserted in
    the wrong place by some editor or copyist, or that the author was
    confused in his dates. The "stadium" is the famous foot-race at
    Olympia, 606 3/4 English feet in length, run on a course also
    called the "Stadion," which was exactly a stade long.

 (2) Peltasts, i.e. light infantry armed with the "pelta" or light
    shield, instead of the heavy {aspis} of the hoplite or heavy
    infantry soldiers.

On the seventeenth day after the incursion above mentioned Thrasylus sailed to Ephesus. He
disembarked his troops in two divisions, his heavy infantry in the neighbourhood of Mount Coressus;
his cavalry, peltasts, and marines, with the remainder of his force, near the marsh on the
other side of the city. At daybreak he pushed forward both divisions. The citizens of Ephesus,
on their side, were not slow to protect themselves. They had to aid them the troops brought
up by Tissaphernes, as well as two detachments of Syracusans, consisting of the crews of their
former twenty vessels and those of five new vessels which had opportunely arrived quite recently
under Eucles, the son of Hippon, and Heracleides, the son of Aristogenes, together with two
Selinuntian vessels. All these several forces first attacked the heavy infantry near Coressus;
these they routed, killing about one hundred of them, and driving the remainder down into the
sea. They then turned to deal with the second division on the marsh. Here, too, the Athenians
were put to flight, and as many as three hundred of them perished. On this spot the Ephesians
erected a trophy, and another at Coressus. The valour of the Syracusans and Selinuntians had
been so conspicuous that the citizens presented many of them, both publicly and privately,
with prizes for distinction in the field, besides offering the right of residence in their
city with certain immunities to all who at any time might wish to live there. To the Selinuntians,
indeed, as their own city had lately been destroyed, they offered full citizenship.

The Athenians, after picking up their dead under a truce, set sail for Notium, and having there
buried the slain, continued their voyage towards Lesbos and the Hellespont. Whilst lying at
anchor in the harbour of Methymna, in that island, they caught sight of the Syracusan vessels,
five-and-twenty in number, coasting along from Ephesus. They put out to sea to attack them,
and captured four ships with their crews, and chased the remainder back to Ephesus. The prisoners
were sent by Thrasylus to Athens, with one exception. This was an Athenian, Alcibiades, who
was a cousin and fellow-exile of Alcibiades. Him Thrasylus released. (3) From Methymna Thrasylus
set sail to Sestos to join the main body of the army, after which the united forces crossed
to Lampsacus. And now winter was approaching. It was the winter in which the Syracusan prisoners
who had been immured in the stone quarries of Piraeus dug through the rock and escaped one
night, some to Decelia and others to Megara. At Lampsacus Alcibiades was anxious to marshal
the whole military force there collected in one body, but the old troops refused to be incorporated
with those of Thrasylus. "They, who had never yet been beaten, with these newcomers who had
just suffered a defeat." So they devoted the winter to fortifying Lampsacus. They also made
an expedition against Abydos, where Pharnabazus, coming to the rescue of the place, encountered
them with numerous cavalry, but was defeated and forced to flee, Alcibiades pursuing hard with
his cavalry and one hundred and twenty infantry under the command of Menander, till darkness
intervened. After this battle the soldiers came together of their own accord, and freely fraternised
with the troops of Thrasylus. This expedition was followed by other incursions during the winter
into the interior, where they found plenty to do ravaging the king's territory.

 (3) Reading {apelusen}. Wolf's conjecture for the MSS. {katelousen} =
    stoned. See Thirlwall, "Hist. Gr." IV. xxix. 93 note.

It was at this period also that the Lacedaemonians allowed their revolted helots from Malea,
who had found an asylum at Coryphasium, to depart under a flag of truce. It was also about
the same period that the Achaeans betrayed the colonists of Heracleia Trachinia, when they
were all drawn up in battle to meet the hostile Oetaeans, whereby as many as seven hundred
of them were lost, together with the governor (4) from Lacedaemon, Labotas. Thus the year came
to its close--a year marked further by a revolt of the Medes from Darius, the king of Persia,
followed by renewed submission to his authority.

 (4) Technically {armostes} (harmost), i.e. administrator.

III

B.C. 408. The year following is the year in which the temple of Athena, in Phocaea, was struck
by lightning and set on fire. (1) With the cessation of winter, in early spring, the Athenians
set sail with the whole of their force to Proconnesus, and thence advanced upon Chalcedon and
Byzantium, encamping near the former town. The men of Chalcedon, aware of their approach, had
taken the precaution to deposit all their pillageable property with their neighbours, the Bithynian
Thracians; whereupon Alcibiades put himself at the head of a small body of heavy infantry with
the cavalry, and giving orders to the fleet to follow along the coast, marched against the
Bithynians and demanded back the property of the Chalcedonians, threatening them with war in
case of refusal. The Bithynians delivered up the property. Returning to camp, not only thus
enriched, but with the further satisfaction of having secured pledges of good behaviour from
the Bithynians, Alcibiades set to work with the whole of his troops to draw lines of circumvallation
round Chalcedon from sea to sea, so as to include as much of the river as possible within his
wall, which was made of timber. Thereupon the Lacedaemonian governor, Hippocrates, let his
troops out of the city and offered battle, and the Athenians, on their side, drew up their
forces opposite to receive him; while Pharnabazus, from without the lines of circumvallation,
was still advancing with his army and large bodies of horse. Hippocrates and Thrasylus engaged
each other with their heavy infantry for a long while, until Alcibiades, with a detachment
of infantry and the cavalry, intervened. Presently Hippocrates fell, and the troops under him
fled into the city; at the same instant Pharnabazus, unable to effect a junction with the Lacedaemonian
leader, owing to the circumscribed nature of the ground and the close proximity of the river
to the enemy's lines, retired to the Heracleium, (2) belonging to the Chalcedonians, where
his camp lay. After this success Alcibiades set off to the Hellespont and the Chersonese to
raise money, and the remaining generals came to terms with Pharnabazus in respect of Chalcedon;
according to these, the Persian satrap agreed to pay the Athenians twenty talents (3) in behalf
of the town, and to grant their ambassadors a safe conduct up country to the king. It was further
stipulated by mutual consent and under oaths provided, that the Chalcedonians should continue
the payment of their customary tribute to Athens, being also bound to discharge all outstanding
debts. The Athenians, on their side, were bound to desist from all hostilities until the return
of their ambassadors from the king. These oaths were not witnessed by Alcibiades, who was now
in the neighbourhood of Selybria. Having taken that place, he presently appeared before the
walls of Byzantium at the head of the men of Chersonese, who came out with their whole force;
he was aided further by troops from Thrace and more than three hundred horse. Accordingly Pharnabazus,
insisting that he too must take the oath, decided to remain in Chalcedon, and to await his
arrival from Byzantium. Alcibiades came, but was not prepared to bind himself by any oaths,
unless Pharnabazus would, on his side, take oaths to himself. After this, oaths were exchanged
between them by proxy. Alcibiades took them at Chrysopolis in the presence of two representatives
sent by Pharnabazus--namely, Mitrobates and Arnapes. Pharnabazus took them at Chalcedon in
the presence of Euryptolemus and Diotimus, who represented Alcibiades. Both parties bound themselves
not only by the general oath, but also interchanged personal pledges of good faith.

 (1) The MSS. here give the words, "in the ephorate of Pantacles and
    the archonship of Antigenes, two-and-twenty years from the
    beginning of the war," but the twenty-second year of the war =
    B.C. 410; Antigenes archon, B.C. 407 = Ol. 93, 2; the passage must
    be regarded as a note mis-inserted by some editor or copyist (vide
    supra, I. 11.)

 (2) I.e. sacred place or temple of Heracles.

 (3) Twenty talents = 4800 pounds; or, more exactly, 4875 pounds.

This done, Pharnabazus left Chalcedon at once, with injunctions that those who were going up
to the king as ambassadors should meet him at Cyzicus. The representatives of Athens were Dorotheus,
Philodices, Theogenes, Euryptolemus, and Mantitheus; with them were two Argives, Cleostratus
and Pyrrholochus. An embassy of the Lacedaemonians was also about to make the journey. This
consisted of Pasippidas and his fellows, with whom were Hermocrates, now an exile from Syracuse,
and his brother Proxenus. So Pharnabazus put himself at their head. Meanwhile the Athenians
prosecuted the siege of Byzantium; lines of circumvallation were drawn; and they diversified
the blockade by sharpshooting at long range and occasional assaults upon the walls. Inside
the city lay Clearchus, the Lacedaemonian governor, and a body of Perioci with a small detachment
of Neodamodes. (4) There was also a body of Megarians under their general Helixus, a Megarian,
and another body of Boeotians, with their general Coeratadas. The Athenians, finding presently
that they could effect nothing by force, worked upon some of the inhabitants to betray the
place. Clearchus, meanwhile, never dreaming that any one would be capable of such an act, had
crossed over to the opposite coast to visit Pharnabazus; he had left everything in perfect
order, entrusting the government of the city to Coeratadas and Helixus. His mission was to
obtain pay for the soldiers from the Persian satrap, and to collect vessels from various quarters.
Some were already in the Hellespont, where they had been left as guardships by Pasippidas,
or else at Antandrus. Others formed the fleet which Agesandridas, who had formerly served as
a marine (5) under Mindarus, now commanded on the Thracian coast. Others Clearchus purposed
to have built, and with the whole united squadron to so injure the allies of the Athenians
as to draw off the besieging army from Byzantium. But no sooner was he fairly gone than those
who were minded to betray the city set to work. Their names were Cydon, Ariston, Anaxicrates,
Lycurgus, and Anaxilaus. The last-named was afterwards impeached for treachery in Lacedaemon
on the capital charge, and acquitted on the plea that, to begin with, he was not a Lacedaemonian,
but a Byzantine, and, so far from having betrayed the city, he had saved it, when he saw women
and children perishing of starvation; for Clearchus had given away all the corn in the city
to the Lacedaemonian soldiers. It was for these reasons, as Anaxilaus himself admitted, he
had introduced the enemy, and not for the sake of money, nor out of hatred to Lacedaemon.

 (4) According to the constitution of Lacedaemon the whole government
    was in Dorian hands. The subject population was divided into (1)
    Helots, who were State serfs. The children of Helots were at times
    brought up by Spartans and called "Mothakes"; Helots who had
    received their liberty were called "Neodamodes" ({neodamodeis}).
    After the conquest of Messenia this class was very numerous. (2)
    Perioeci. These were the ancient Achaean inhabitants, living in
    towns and villages, and managing their own affairs, paying
    tribute, and serving in the army as heavy-armed soldiers. In 458
    B.C. they were said to number thirty thousand. The Spartans
    themselves were divided, like all Dorians, into three tribes,
    Hylleis, Dymanes, and Pamphyli, each of which tribes was divided
    into ten "obes," which were again divided into {oikoi} or families
    possessed of landed properties. In 458 B.C. there were said to be
    nine thousand such families; but in course of time, through
    alienation of lands, deaths in war, and other causes, their
    numbers were much diminished; and in many cases there was a loss
    of status, so that in the time of Agis III., B.C. 244, we hear of
    two orders of Spartans, the {omoioi} and the {upomeiones}
    (inferiors); seven hundred Spartans (families) proper and one
    hundred landed proprietors. See Mullers "Dorians," vol. ii. bk.
    iii. ch. x. S. 3 (Eng. trans.); Arist. "Pol." ii. 9, 15; Plut.
    ("Agis").

 (5) The greek word is {epibates}, which some think was the title of an
    inferior naval officer in the Spartan service, but there is no
    proof of this. Cf. Thuc. viii. 61, and Prof. Jowett's note; also
    Grote, "Hist. of Greece," viii. 27 (2d ed.)

As soon as everything was ready, these people opened the gates leading to the Thracian Square,
as it is called, and admitted the Athenian troops with Alcibiades at their head. Helixus and
Coeratadas, in complete ignorance of the plot, hastened to the Agora with the whole of the
garrison, ready to confront the danger; but finding the enemy in occupation, they had nothing
for it but to give themselves up. They were sent off as prisoners to Athens, where Coeratadas,
in the midst of the crowd and confusion of debarkation at Piraeus, gave his guards the slip,
and made his way in safety to Decelia.

IV

B.C. 407. Pharnabazus and the ambassadors were passing the winter at Gordium in Phrygia, when
they heard of the occurrences at Byzantium. Continuing their journey to the king's court in
the commencement of spring, they were met by a former embassy, which was now on its return
journey. These were the Lacedaemonian ambassadors, Boeotius and his party, with the other envoys;
who told them that the Lacedaemonians had obtained from the king all they wanted. One of the
company was Cyrus, the new governor of all the seaboard districts, who was prepared to co-operate
with the Lacedaemonians in war. He was the bearer, moreover, of a letter with the royal seal
attached. It was addressed to all the populations of Lower Asia, and contained the following
words: "I send down Cyrus as 'Karanos'" (1)--that is to say, supreme lord--"over all those
who muster at Castolus." The ambassadors of the Athenians, even while listening to this announcement,
and indeed after they had seen Cyrus, were still desirous, if possible, to continue their journey
to the king, or, failing that, to return home. Cyrus, however, urged upon Pharnabazus either
to deliver them up to himself, or to defer sending them home at present; his object being to
prevent the Athenians learning what was going on. Pharnabazus, wishing to escape all blame,
for the time being detained them, telling them, at one time, that he would presently escort
them up country to the king, and at another time that he would send them safe home. But when
three years had elapsed, he prayed Cyrus to let them go, declaring that he had taken an oath
to bring them back to the sea, in default of escorting them up to the king. Then at last they
received safe conduct to Ariobarzanes, with orders for their further transportation. The latter
conducted them a stage further, to Cius in Mysia; and from Cius they set sail to join their
main armament.

 (1) {Karanos.} Is this a Greek word, a Doric form, {karanos}, akin to
    {kara} (cf. {karenon}) = chief? or is it not more likely a Persian
    or native word, Karanos? and might not the title be akin
    conceivably to the word {korano}, which occurs on many Indo-
    Bactrian coins (see A. von Sallet, "Die Nachfolger Alexanders des
    Grossen," p. 57, etc.)? or is {koiranos} the connecting link? The
    words translated "that is to say, supreme lord," {to de karanon
    esti kurion}, look very like a commentator's gloss.

Alcibiades, whose chief desire was to return home to Athens with the troops, immediately set
sail for Samos; and from that island, taking twenty of the ships, he sailed to the Ceramic
Gulf of Caria, where he collected a hundred talents, and so returned to Samos.

Thrasybulus had gone Thrace-wards with thirty ships. In this quarter he reduced various places
which had revolted to Lacedaemon, including the island of Thasos, which was in a bad plight,
the result of wars, revolutions, and famine.

Thrasylus, with the rest of the army, sailed back straight to Athens. On his arrival he found
that the Athenians had already chosen as their general Alcibiades, who was still in exile,
and Thrasybulus, who was also absent, and as a third, from among those at home, Conon.

Meanwhile Alcibiades, with the moneys lately collected and his fleet of twenty ships, left
Samos and visited Paros. From Paros he stood out to sea across to Gytheum, (2) to keep an eye
on the thirty ships of war which, as he was informed, the Lacedaemonians were equipping in
that arsenal. Gytheum would also be a favourable point of observation from which to gauge the
disposition of his fellow-countrymen and the prospects of his recall. When at length their
good disposition seemed to him established, not only by his election as general, but by the
messages of invitation which he received in private from his friends, he sailed home, and entered
Piraeus on the very day of the festival of the Plunteria, (3) when the statue of Athena is
veiled and screened from public gaze. This was a coincidence, as some thought, of evil omen,
and unpropitious alike to himself and the State, for no Athenian would transact serious business
on such a day.

 (2) Gytheum, the port and arsenal of Sparta, situated near the head of
    the Laconian Gulf (now Marathonisi).

 (3) {ta Plunteria}, or feast of washings, held on the 25th of the
    month Thargelion, when the image of the goddess Athena was
    stripped in order that her clothes might be washed by the
    Praxiergidae; neither assembly nor court was held on that day, and
    the Temple was closed.

As he sailed into the harbour, two great crowds--one from the Piraeus, the other from the city
(4)--flocked to meet the vessels. Wonderment, mixed with a desire to see Alcibiades, was the
prevailing sentiment of the multitude. Of him they spoke: some asserting that he was the best
of citizens, and that in his sole instance banishment had been ill-deserved. He had been the
victim of plots, hatched in the brains of people less able than himself, however much they
might excel in pestilent speech; men whose one principle of statecraft was to look to their
private gains; whereas this man's policy had ever been to uphold the common weal, as much by
his private means as by all the power of the State. His own choice, eight years ago, when the
charge of impiety in the matter of the mysteries was still fresh, would have been to submit
to trial at once. It was his personal foes, who had succeeded in postponing that undeniably
just procedure; who waited till his back was turned, and then robbed him of his fatherland.
Then it was that, being made the very slave of circumstance, he was driven to court the men
he hated most; and at a time when his own life was in daily peril, he must see his dearest
friends and fellow-citizens, nay, the very State itself, bent on a suicidal course, and yet,
in the exclusion of exile, be unable to lend a helping hand. "It is not men of this stamp,"
they averred, "who desire changes in affairs and revolution: had he not already guaranteed
to him by the Democracy a position higher than that of his equals in age, and scarcely if at
all inferior to his seniors? How different was the position of his enemies. It had been the
fortune of these, though they were known to be the same men they had always been, to use their
lately acquired power for the destruction in the first instance of the better classes; and
then, being alone left surviving, to be accepted by their fellow-citizens in the absence of
better men."

 (4) Or, "collected to meet the vessels from curiosity and a desire to
    see Alcibiades."

Others, however, insisted that for all their past miseries and misfortunes Alcibiades alone
was responsible: "If more trials were still in store for the State, here was the master mischief-maker
ready at his post to precipitate them."

When the vessels came to their moorings, close to the land, Alcibiades, from fear of his enemies,
was unwilling to disembark at once. Mounting on the quarterdeck, he scanned the multitude,
(5) anxious to make certain of the presence of his friends. Presently his eyes lit upon Euryptolemus,
the son of Peisianax, who was his cousin, and then on the rest of his relations and other friends.
Upon this he landed, and so, in the midst of an escort ready to put down any attempt upon his
person, made his way to the city.

 (5) Or, "he looked to see if his friends were there."

In the Senate and Public Assembly (6) he made speeches, defending himself against the charge
of impiety, and asserting that he had been the victim of injustice, with other like topics,
which in the present temper of the assembly no one ventured to gainsay.

 (6) Technically the "Boule" ({Boule}) or Senate, and "Ecclesia" or
    Popular Assembly.

He was then formally declared leader and chief of the State, with irresponsible powers, as
being the sole individual capable of recovering the ancient power and prestige of Athens. Armed
with this authority, his first act was to institute anew the processional march to Eleusis;
for of late years, owing to the war, the Athenians had been forced to conduct the mysteries
by sea. Now, at the head of the troops, he caused them to be conducted once again by land.
This done, his next step was to muster an armament of one thousand five hundred heavy infantry,
one hundred and fifty cavalry, and one hundred ships; and lastly, within three months of his
return, he set sail for Andros, which had revolted from Athens.

The generals chosen to co-operate with him on land were Aristocrates and Adeimantus, the son
of Leucophilides. He disembarked his troops on the island of Andros at Gaurium, and routed
the Andrian citizens who sallied out from the town to resist the invader; forcing them to return
and keep close within their walls, though the number who fell was not large. This defeat was
shared by some Lacedaemonians who were in the place. Alcibiades erected a trophy, and after
a few days set sail himself for Samos, which became his base of operations in the future conduct
of the war.

V

At a date not much earlier than that of the incidents just described, the Lacedaemonians had
sent out Lysander as their admiral, in the place of Cratesippidas, whose period of office had
expired. The new admiral first visited Rhodes, where he got some ships, and sailed to Cos and
Miletus, and from the latter place to Ephesus. At Ephesus he waited with seventy sail, expecting
the advent of Cyrus in Sardis, when he at once went up to pay the prince a visit with the ambassadors
from Lacedaemon. And now an opportunity was given to denounce the proceedings of Tissaphernes,
and at the same time to beg Cyrus himself to show as much zeal as possible in the prosecution
of the war. Cyrus replied that not only had he received express injunction from his father
to the same effect, but that his own views coincided with their wishes, which he was determined
to carry out to the letter. He had, he informed them, brought with him five hundred talents;
(1) and if that sum failed, he had still the private revenue, which his father allowed him,
to fall back upon, and when this resource was in its turn exhausted, he would coin the gold
and silver throne on which he sat, into money for their benefit. (2)

 (1) About 120,000 pounds. One Euboic or Attic talent = sixty minae =
    six thousand drachmae = 243 pounds 15 shillings of our money.

 (2) Cf. the language of Tissaphernes, Thuc. viii. 81.

His audience thanked him for what he said, and further begged him to fix the rate of payment
for the seamen at one Attic drachma per man, (3) explaining that should this rate of payment
be adopted, the sailors of the Athenians would desert, and in the end there would be a saving
of expenditure. Cyrus complimented them on the soundness of their arguments, but said that
it was not in his power to exceed the injunctions of the king. The terms of agreement were
precise, thirty minae (4) a month per vessel to be given, whatever number of vessels the Lacedaemonians
might choose to maintain.

 (3) About 9 3/4 pence; a drachma (= six obols) would be very high pay
    for a sailor--indeed, just double the usual amount. See Thuc. vi.
    8 and viii. 29, and Prof. Jowett ad loc. Tissaphernes had, in the
    winter of 412 B.C., distributed one month's pay among the
    Peloponnesian ships at this high rate of a drachma a day, "as his
    envoy had promised at Lacedaemon;" but this he proposed to reduce
    to half a drachma, "until he had asked the king's leave, promising
    that if he obtained it, he would pay the entire drachma. On the
    remonstrance, however, of Hermocrates, the Syracusan general, he
    promised to each man a payment of somewhat more than three obols."

 (4) Nearly 122 pounds; and thirty minae a month to each ship (the crew
    of each ship being taken at two hundred) = three obols a day to
    each man. The terms of agreement to which Cyrus refers may have
    been specified in the convention mentioned above in chap. iv,
    which Boeotius and the rest were so proud to have obtained. But
    see Grote, "Hist. of Greece," vol. viii. p. 192 note (2d ed.)

To this rejoinder Lysander at the moment said nothing. But after dinner, when Cyrus drank to
his health, asking him "What he could do to gratify him most?" Lysander replied, "Add an obol
(5) to the sailors' pay." After this the pay was raised to four instead of three obols, as
it hitherto had been. Nor did the liberality of Cyrus end here; he not only paid up all arrears,
but further gave a month's pay in advance, so that, if the enthusiasm of the army had been
great before, it was greater than ever now. The Athenians when they heard the news were proportionately
depressed, and by help of Tissaphernes despatched ambassadors to Cyrus. That prince, however,
refused to receive them, nor were the prayers of Tissaphernes of any avail, however much he
insisted that Cyrus should adopt the policy which he himself, on the advice of Alcibiades,
had persistently acted on. This was simply not to suffer any single Hellenic state to grow
strong at the expense of the rest, but to keep them all weak alike, distracted by internecine
strife.

 (5) An obol = one-sixth of a drachma; the Attic obol = rather more
    than 1 1/2 pence.

Lysander, now that the organisation of his navy was arranged to his satisfaction, beached his
squadron of ninety vessels at Ephesus, and sat with hands folded, whilst the vessels dried
and underwent repairs. Alcibiades, being informed that Thrasybulus had come south of the Hellespont
and was fortifying Phocaea, sailed across to join him, leaving his own pilot Antiochus in command
of the fleet, with orders not to attack Lysander's fleet. Antiochus, however, was tempted to
leave Notium and sail into the harbour of Ephesus with a couple of ships, his own and another,
past the prows of Lysander's squadron. The Spartan at first contented himself with launching
a few of his ships, and started in pursuit of the intruder; but when the Athenians came out
with other vessels to assist Antiochus, he formed his whole squadron into line of battle, and
bore down upon them, whereupon the Athenians followed suit, and getting their remaining triremes
under weigh at Notium, stood out to sea as fast as each vessel could clear the point. (6) Thus
it befell in the engagement which ensued, that while the enemy was in due order, the Athenians
came up in scattered detachments and without concert, and in the end were put to flight with
the loss of fifteen ships of war. Of the crews, indeed, the majority escaped, though a certain
number fell into the hands of the enemy. Then Lysander collected his vessels, and having erected
a trophy on Cape Notium, sailed across to Ephesus, whilst the Athenians retired to Samos.

 (6) {os ekastos enoixen}, for this nautical term see above.

On his return to Samos a little later, Alcibiades put out to sea with the whole squadron in
the direction of the harbour of Ephesus. At the mouth of the harbour he marshalled his fleet
in battle order, and tried to tempt the enemy to an engagement; but as Lysander, conscious
of his inferiority in numbers, refused to accept the challenge, he sailed back again to Samos.
Shortly after this the Lacedaemonians captured Delphinium and Eion. (7)

 (7) This should probably be Teos, in Ionia, in spite of the MSS.
    {'Eiona}. The place referred to cannot at any rate be the well-
    known Eion at the mouth of the Strymon in Thrace.

But now the news of the late disaster at Notium had reached the Athenians at home, and in their
indignation they turned upon Alcibiades, to whose negligence and lack of self-command they
attributed the destruction of the ships. Accordingly they chose ten new generals--namely Conon,
Diomedon, Leon, Pericles, Erasinides, Aristocrates, Archestratus, Protomachus, Thrasylus, and
Aristogenes. Alcibiades, who was moreover in bad odour in the camp, sailed away with a single
trireme to his private fortress in the Chersonese.

After this Conon, in obedience to a decree of the Athenian people, set sail from Andros with
the twenty vessels under his command in that island to Samos, and took command of the whole
squadron. To fill the place thus vacated by Conon, Phanosthenes was sent to Andros with four
ships. That captain was fortunate enough to intercept and capture two Thurian ships of war,
crews and all, and these captives were all imprisoned by the Athenians, with the exception
of their leader Dorieus. He was the Rhodian, who some while back had been banished from Athens
and from his native city by the Athenians, when sentence of death was passed upon him and his
family. This man, who had once enjoyed the right of citizenship among them, they now took pity
on and released him without ransom.

When Conon had reached Samos he found the armament in a state of great despondency. Accordingly
his first measure was to man seventy ships with their full complement, instead of the former
hundred and odd vessels. With this squadron he put to sea accompanied by the other generals,
and confined himself to making descents first at one point and then at another of the enemy's
territory, and to collecting plunder.

And so the year drew to its close: a year signalled further by an invasion of Sicily by the
Carthaginians, with one hundred and twenty ships of war and a land force of one hundred and
twenty thousand men, which resulted in the capture of Agrigentum. The town was finally reduced
to famine after a siege of seven months, the invaders having previously been worsted in battle
and forced to sit down before its walls for so long a time.

VI

B.C. 406. In the following year--the year of the evening eclipse of the moon, and the burning
of the old temple of Athena (1) at Athens (2)--the Lacedaemonians sent out Callicratidas to
replace Lysander, whose period of office had now expired. (3) Lysander, when surrendering the
squadron to his successor, spoke of himself as the winner of a sea fight, which had left him
in undisputed mastery of the sea, and with this boast he handed over the ships to Callicratidas,
who retorted, "If you will convey the fleet from Ephesus, keeping Samos (4) on your right"
(that is, past where the Athenian navy lay), "and hand it over to me at Miletus, I will admit
that you are master of the sea." But Lysander had no mind to interfere in the province of another
officer. Thus Callicratidas assumed responsibility. He first manned, in addition to the squadron
which he received from Lysander, fifty new vessels furnished by the allies from Chios and Rhodes
and elsewhere. When all these contingents were assembled, they formed a total of one hundred
and forty sail, and with these he began making preparations for engagement with the enemy.
But it was impossible for him not to note the strong current of opposition which he encountered
from the friends of Lysander. Not only was there lack of zeal in their service, but they openly
disseminated an opinion in the States, that it was the greatest possible blunder on the part
of the Lacedaemonians so to change their admirals. Of course, they must from time to time get
officers altogether unfit for the post--men whose nautical knowledge dated from yesterday,
and who, moreover, had no notion of dealing with human beings. It would be very odd if this
practice of sending out people ignorant of the sea and unknown to the folk of the country did
not lead to some catastrophe. Callicratidas at once summoned the Lacedaemonians there present,
and addressed them in the following terms:--

 (1) I.e. as some think, the Erechtheion, which was built partly on the
    site of the old temple of Athena Polias, destroyed by the
    Persians. According to Dr. Dorpfeld, a quite separate building of
    the Doric order, the site of which (S. of the Erechtheion) has
    lately been discovered.

 (2) The MSS. here add "in the ephorate of Pityas and the archonship of
    Callias at Athens;" but though the date is probably correct (cf.
    Leake, "Topography of Athens," vol. i. p. 576 foll.), the words
    are almost certainly a gloss.

 (3) Here the MSS. add "with the twenty-fourth year of the war,"
    probably an annotator's gloss; the correct date should be twenty-
    fifth. Pel. war 26 = B.C. 406. Pel. war 25 ended B.C. 407.

 (4) Lit. on the left (or east) of Samos, looking south from Ephesus.

"For my part," he said, "I am content to stay at home: and if Lysander or any one else claim
greater experience in nautical affairs than I possess, I have no desire to block his path.
Only, being sent out by the State to take command of this fleet, I do not know what is left
to me, save to carry out my instructions to the best of my ability. For yourselves, all I beg
of you, in reference to my personal ambitions and the kind of charges brought against our common
city, and of which you are as well aware as I am, is to state what you consider to be the best
course: am I to stay where I am, or shall I sail back home, and explain the position of affairs
out here?"

No one ventured to suggest any other course than that he should obey the authorities, and do
what he was sent to do. Callicratidas then went up to the court of Cyrus to ask for further
pay for the sailors, but the answer he got from Cyrus was that he should wait for two days.
Callicratidas was annoyed at the rebuff: to dance attendance at the palace gates was little
to his taste. In a fit of anger he cried out at the sorry condition of the Hellenes, thus forced
to flatter the barbarian for the sake of money. "If ever I get back home," he added, "I will
do what in me lies to reconcile the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians." And so he turned and
sailed back to Miletus. From Miletus he sent some triremes to Lacedaemon to get money, and
convoking the public assembly of the Milesians, addressed them thus:--

"Men of Miletus, necessity is laid upon me to obey the rulers at home; but for yourselves,
whose neighbourhood to the barbarians has exposed you to many evils at their hands, I only
ask you to let your zeal in the war bear some proportion to your former sufferings. You should
set an example to the rest of the allies, and show us how to inflict the sharpest and swiftest
injury on our enemy, whilst we await the return from Lacedaemon of my envoys with the necessary
funds. Since one of the last acts of Lysander, before he left us, was to hand back to Cyrus
the funds already on the spot, as though we could well dispense with them. I was thus forced
to turn to Cyrus, but all I got from him was a series of rebuffs; he refused me an audience,
and, for my part, I could not induce myself to hang about his gates like a mendicant. But I
give you my word, men of Miletus, that in return for any assistance which you can render us
while waiting for these aids, I will requite you richly. Only by God's help let us show these
barbarians that we do not need to worship them, in order to punish our foes."

The speech was effective; many members of the assembly arose, and not the least eagerly those
who were accused of opposing him. These, in some terror, proposed a vote of money, backed by
offers of further private contributions. Furnished with these sums, and having procured from
Chios a further remittance of five drachmas (5) a piece as outfit for each seaman, he set sail
to Methyma in Lesbos, which was in the hands of the enemy. But as the Methymnaeans were not
disposed to come over to him (since there was an Athenian garrison in the place, and the men
at the head of affairs were partisans of Athens), he assaulted and took the place by storm.
All the property within accordingly became the spoil of the soldiers. The prisoners were collected
for sale by Callicratidas in the market-place, where, in answer to the demand of the allies,
who called upon him to sell the Methymnaeans also, he made answer, that as long as he was in
command, not a single Hellene should be enslaved if he could help it. The next day he set at
liberty the free-born captives; the Athenian garrison with the captured slaves he sold. (6)
To Conon he sent word:--He would put a stop to his strumpeting the sea. (7) And catching sight
of him, as he put out to sea, at break of day, he gave chase, hoping to cut him off from his
passage to Samos, and prevent his taking refuge there.

 (5) About 4d. But I am afraid that no
    ingenuity of stopping will extract that meaning from the Greek
    words, which are, {te d' usteraia tous men eleutherous apheke tous
    de ton 'Athenaion phrourous kai ta andrapoda ta doula panta
    apedoto}. To spare the Athenian garrison would have been too
    extraordinary a proceeding even for Callicratidas. The idea
    probably never entered his head. It was sufficiently noble for him
    to refuse to sell the Methymnaeans. See the remarks of Mr. W. L.
    Newman, "The Pol. of Aristotle," vol. i. p. 142.

 (7) I.e. the sea was Sparta's bride.

But Conon, aided by the sailing qualities of his fleet, the rowers of which were the pick of
several ships' companies, concentrated in a few vessels, made good his escape, seeking shelter
within the harbour of Mitylene in Lesbos, and with him two of the ten generals, Leon and Erasinides.
Callicratidas, pursuing him with one hundred and seventy sail, entered the harbour simultaneously;
and Conon thus hindered from further or final escape by the too rapid movements of the enemy,
was forced to engage inside the harbour, and lost thirty of his ships, though the crews escaped
to land. The remaining, forty in number, he hauled up under the walls of the town. Callicratidas,
on his side, came to moorings in the harbour; and, having command of the exit, blocked the
Athenian within. His next step was to send for the Methymnaeans in force by land, and to transport
his army across from Chios. Money also came to him from Cyrus.

Conon, finding himself besieged by land and sea, without means of providing himself with corn
from any quarter, the city crowded with inhabitants, and aid from Athens, whither no news of
the late events could be conveyed, impossible, launched two of the fastest sailing vessels
of his squadron. These he manned, before daybreak, with the best rowers whom he could pick
out of the fleet, stowing away the marines at the same time in the hold of the ships and closing
the port shutters. Every day for four days they held out in this fashion, but at evening as
soon as it was dark he disembarked his men, so that the enemy might not suspect what they were
after. On the fifth day, having got in a small stock of provisions, when it was already mid-day
and the blockaders were paying little or no attention, and some of them even were taking their
siesta, the two ships sailed out of the harbour: the one directing her course towards the Hellespont,
whilst her companion made for the open sea. Then, on the part of the blockaders, there was
a rush to the scene of action, as fast as the several crews could get clear of land, in bustle
and confusion, cutting away the anchors, and rousing themselves from sleep, for, as chance
would have it, they had been breakfasting on shore. Once on board, however, they were soon
in hot pursuit of the ship which had started for the open sea, and ere the sun dipped they
overhauled her, and after a successful engagement attached her by cables and towed her back
into harbour, crew and all. Her comrade, making for the Hellespont, escaped, and eventually
reached Athens with news of the blockade. The first relief was brought to the blockaded fleet
by Diomedon, who anchored with twelve vessels in the Mitylenaean Narrows. (8) But a sudden
attack of Callicratidas, who bore down upon him without warning, cost him ten of his vessels,
Diomedon himself escaping with his own ship and one other.

 (8) Or, "Euripus."

Now that the position of affairs, including the blockade, was fully known at Athens, a vote
was passed to send out a reinforcement of one hundred and ten ships. Every man of ripe age,
(9) whether slave or free, was impressed for this service, so that within thirty days the whole
one hundred and ten vessels were fully manned and weighed anchor. Amongst those who served
in this fleet were also many of the knights. (10) The fleet at once stood out across to Samos,
and picked up the Samian vessels in that island. The muster-roll was swelled by the addition
of more than thirty others from the rest of the allies, to whom the same principle of conscription
applied, as also it did to the ships already engaged on foreign service. The actual total,
therefore, when all the contingents were collected, was over one hundred and fifty vessels.

 (9) I.e. from eighteen to sixty years.

 (10) See Boeckh. "P. E. A." Bk. II. chap. xxi. p. 263 (Eng. trans.)

Callicratidas, hearing that the relief squadron had already reached Samos, left fifty ships,
under command of Eteonicus, in the harbour of Mitylene, and setting sail with the other one
hundred and twenty, hove to for the evening meal off Cape Malea in Lesbos, opposite Mitylene.
It so happened that the Athenians on this day were supping on the islands of Arginusae, which
lie opposite Lesbos. In the night the Spartan not only saw their watch-fires, but received
positive information that "these were the Athenians;" and about midnight he got under weigh,
intending to fall upon them suddenly. But a violent downpour of rain with thunder and lightning
prevented him putting out to sea. By daybreak it had cleared, and he sailed towards Arginusae.
On their side, the Athenian squadron stood out to meet him, with their left wing facing towards
the open sea, and drawn up in the following order:--Aristocrates, in command of the left wing,
with fifteen ships, led the van; next came Diomedon with fifteen others, and immediately in
rear of Aristocrates and Diomedon respectively, as their supports, came Pericles and Erasinides.
Parallel with Diomedon were the Samians, with their ten ships drawn up in single line, under
the command of a Samian officer named Hippeus. Next to these came the ten vessels of the taxiarchs,
also in single line, and supporting them, the three ships of the navarchs, with any other allied
vessels in the squadron. The right wing was entrusted to Protomachus with fifteen ships, and
next to him (on the extreme right) was Thrasylus with another division of fifteen. Protomachus
was supported by Lysias with an equal number of ships, and Thrasylus by Aristogenes. The object
of this formation was to prevent the enemy from manouvring so as to break their line by striking
them amidships, (11) since they were inferior in sailing power.

 (11) Lit. "by the diekplous." Cf. Thuc. i. 49, and Arnold's note, who
    says: "The 'diecplus' was a breaking through the enemy's line in
    order by a rapid turning of the vessel to strike the enemy's ship
    on the side or stern, where it was most defenceless, and so to
    sink it." So, it seems, "the superiority of nautical skill has
    passed," as Grote (viii. p. 234) says, "to the Peloponnesians and
    their allies." Well may the historian add, "How astonished would
    the Athenian Admiral Phormion have been, if he could have
    witnessed the fleets and the order of battle at Arginusae!" See
    Thuc. iv. 11.

The Lacedaemonians, on the contrary, trusting to their superior seamanship, were formed opposite
with their ships all in single line, with the special object of manouvring so as either to
break the enemy's line or to wheel round them. Callicratidas commanded the right wing in person.
Before the battle the officer who acted as his pilot, the Megarian Hermon, suggested that it
might be well to withdraw the fleet as the Athenian ships were far more numerous. But Callicratidas
replied that Sparta would be no worse off even if he personally should perish, but to flee
would be disgraceful. (12) And now the fleets approached, and for a long space the battle endured.
At first the vessels were engaged in crowded masses, and later on in scattered groups. At length
Callicratidas, as his vessel dashed her beak into her antagonist, was hurled off into the sea
and disappeared. At the same instant Protomachus, with his division on the right, had defeated
the enemy's left, and then the flight of the Peloponnesians began towards Chios, though a very
considerable body of them made for Phocaea, whilst the Athenians sailed back again to Arginusae.
The losses on the side of the Athenians were twenty-five ships, crews and all, with the exception
of the few who contrived to reach dry land. On the Peloponnesian side, nine out of the ten
Lacedaemonian ships, and more than sixty belonging to the rest of the allied squadron, were lost.

 (12) For the common reading, {oikeitai}, which is ungrammatical,
    various conjectures have been made, e.g.

      {oikieitai} = "would be none the worse off for citizens,"
      {oikesetai} = "would be just as well administered without him,"

    but as the readings and their renderings are alike doubtful, I
    have preferred to leave the matter vague. Cf. Cicero, "De Offic."
    i. 24; Plutarch, "Lac. Apophth." p. 832.

After consultation the Athenian generals agreed that two captains of triremes, Theramenes and
Thrasybulus, accompanied by some of the taxiarchs, should take forty-seven ships and sail to
the assistance of the disabled fleet and of the men on board, whilst the rest of the squadron
proceeded to attack the enemy's blockading squadron under Eteonicus at Mitylene. In spite of
their desire to carry out this resolution, the wind and a violent storm which arose prevented
them. So they set up a trophy, and took up their quarters for the night. As to Etenoicus, the
details of the engagement ware faithfully reported to him by the express despatch-boat in attendance.
On receipt of the news, however, he sent the despatch-boat out again the way she came, with
an injunction to those on board of her to sail off quickly without exchanging a word with any
one. Then on a sudden they were to return garlanded with wreaths of victory and shouting "Callicratidas
has won a great sea fight, and the whole Athenian squadron is destroyed." This they did, and
Eteonicus, on his side, as soon as the despatch-boat came sailing in, proceeded to offer sacrifice
of thanksgiving in honour of the good news. Meanwhile he gave orders that the troops were to
take their evening meal, and that the masters of the trading ships were silently to stow away
their goods on board the merchant ships and make sail as fast as the favourable breeze could
speed them to Chios. The ships of war were to follow suit with what speed they might. This
done, he set fire to his camp, and led off the land forces to Methymna. Conon, finding the
enemy had made off, and the wind had grown comparatively mild, (13) got his ships afloat, and
so fell in with the Athenian squadron, which had by this time set out from Arginusae. To these
he explained the proceedings of Eteonicus. The squadron put into Mitylene, and from Mitylene
stood across to Chios, and thence, without effecting anything further, sailed back to Samos.

 (13) Or, "had changed to a finer quarter."

VII

All the above-named generals, with the exception of Conon, were presently deposed by the home
authorities. In addition to Conon two new generals were chosen, Adeimantus and Philocles. Of
those concerned in the late victory two never returned to Athens: these were Protomachus and
Aristogenes. The other six sailed home. Their names were Pericles, Diomedon, Lysias, Aristocrates,
Thrasylus, and Erasinides. On their arrival Archidemus, the leader of the democracy at that
date, who had charge of the two obol fund, (1) inflicted a fine on Erasinides, and accused
him before the Dicastery (2) of having appropriated money derived from the Hellespont, which
belonged to the people. He brought a further charge against him of misconduct while acting
as general, and the court sentenced him to imprisonment.

 (1) Reading {tes diobelais}, a happy conjecture for the MSS. {tes
    diokelias}, which is inexplicable. See Grote, "Hist. of Greece,"
    vol. viii. p. 244 note (2d ed.)

 (2) I.e. a legal tribunal or court of law. At Athens the free citizens
    constitutionally sworn and impannelled sat as "dicasts"
    ("jurymen," or rather as a bench of judges) to hear cases
    ({dikai}). Any particular board of dicasts formed a "dicastery."

These proceedings in the law court were followed by the statement of the generals before the
senate (3) touching the late victory and the magnitude of the storm. Timocrates then proposed
that the other five generals should be put in custody and handed over to the public assembly.
(4) Whereupon the senate committed them all to prison. Then came the meeting of the public
assembly, in which others, and more particularly Theramenes, formally accused the generals.
He insisted that they ought to show cause why they had not picked up the shipwrecked crews.
To prove that there had been no attempt on their part to attach blame to others, he might point,
as conclusive testimony, to the despatch sent by the generals themselves to the senate and
the people, in which they attributed the whole disaster to the storm, and nothing else. After
this the generals each in turn made a defence, which was necessarily limited to a few words,
since no right of addressing the assembly at length was allowed by law. Their explanation of
the occurrences was that, in order to be free to sail against the enemy themselves, they had
devolved the duty of picking up the shipwrecked crews upon certain competent captains of men-of-war,
who had themselves been generals in their time, to wit Theramenes and Tharysbulus, and others
of like stamp. If blame could attach to any one at all with regard to the duty in question,
those to whom their orders had been given were the sole persons they could hold responsible.
"But," they went on to say, "we will not, because these very persons have denounced us, invent
a lie, and say that Theramenes and Thrasybulus are to blame, when the truth of the matter is
that the magnitude of the storm alone prevented the burial of the dead and the rescue of the
living." In proof of their contention, they produced the pilots and numerous other witnesses
from among those present at the engagement. By these arguments they were in a fair way to persuade
the people of their innocence. Indeed many private citizens rose wishing to become bail for
the accused, but it was resolved to defer decision till another meeting of the assembly. It
was indeed already so late that it would have been impossible to see to count the show of hands.
It was further resolved that the senate meanwhile should prepare a measure, to be introduced
at the next assembly, as to the mode in which the accused should take their trial.

 (3) This is the Senate or Council of Five Hundred. One of its chief
    duties was to prepare measures for discussion in the assembly. It
    had also a certain amount of judicial power, hearing complaints
    and inflicting fines up to fifty drachmas. It sat daily, a
    "prytany" of fifty members of each of the ten tribes in rotation
    holding office for a month in turn.

 (4) This is the great Public Assembly (the Ecclesia), consisting of
    all genuine Athenian citizens of more than twenty years of age.

Then came the festival of the Aparturia, (5) with its family gatherings of fathers and kinsfolk.
Accordingly the party of Theramenes procured numbers of people clad in black apparel, and close-shaven,
(6) who were to go in and present themselves before the public assembly in the middle of the
festival, as relatives, presumably, of the men who had perished; and they persuaded Callixenus
to accuse the generals in the senate. The next step was to convoke the assembly, when the senate
laid before it the proposal just passed by their body, at the instance of Callixenus, which
ran as follows: "Seeing that both the parties to this case, to wit, the prosecutors of the
generals on the one hand, and the accused themselves in their defence on the other, have been
heard in the late meeting of the assembly; we propose that the people of Athens now record
their votes, one and all, by their tribes; that a couple of voting urns be placed for the convenience
of each several tribe; and the public crier in the hearing of each several tribe proclaim the
mode of voting as follows: 'Let every one who finds the generals guilty of not rescuing the
heroes of the late sea fight deposit his vote in urn No. 1. Let him who is of the contrary
opinion deposit his vote in urn No. 2. Further, in the event of the aforesaid generals being
found guilty, let death be the penalty. Let the guilty persons be delivered over to the eleven.
Let their property be confiscated to the State, with the exception of one tithe, which falls
to the goddess.'"

 (5) An important festival held in October at Athens, and in nearly all
    Ionic cities. Its objects were (1) the recognition of a common
    descent from Ion, the son of Apollo Patrous; and (2) the
    maintenance of the ties of clanship. See Grote, "Hist. of Greece,"
    vol. viii. p. 260 foll. (2d ed.); Jebb, "Theophr." xviii. 5.

 (6) I.e. in sign of mourning.

Now there came forward in the assembly a man, who said that he had escaped drowning by clinging
to a meal tub. The poor fellows perishing around him had commissioned him, if he succeeded
in saving himself, to tell the people of Athens how bravely they had fought for their fatherland,
and how the generals had left them there to drown.

Presently Euryptolemus, the son of Peisianax, and others served a notice of indictment on Callixenus,
insisting that his proposal was unconstitutional, and this view of the case was applauded by
some members of the assembly. But the majority kept crying out that it was monstrous if the
people were to be hindered by any stray individual from doing what seemed to them right. And
when Lysicus, embodying the spirit of those cries, formally proposed that if these persons
would not abandon their action, they should be tried by the same vote along with the generals:
a proposition to which the mob gave vociferous assent; and so these were compelled to abandon
their summonses. Again, when some of the Prytanes (7) objected to put a resolution to the vote
which was in itself unconstitutional, Callixenus again got up and accused them in the same
terms, and the shouting began again. "Yes, summons all who refuse," until the Prytanes, in
alarm, all agreed with one exception to permit the voting. This obstinate dissentient was Socrates,
the son of Sophroniscus, who insisted that he would do nothing except in accordance with the
law. (8) After this Euryptolemus rose and spoke in behalf of the generals. He said:--

 (7) Prytanes--the technical term for the senators of the presiding
    tribe, who acted as presidents of the assembly. Their chairman for
    the day was called Epistates.

 (8) For the part played by Socrates see further Xenophon's
    "Memorabilia," I. i. 18; IV. iv. 2.

"I stand here, men of Athens, partly to accuse Pericles, though he is a close and intimate
connection of my own, and Diomedon, who is my friend, and partly to urge certain considerations
on their behalf, but chiefly to press upon you what seems to me the best course for the State
collectively. I hold them to blame in that they dissuaded their colleagues from their intention
to send a despatch to the senate and this assembly, which should have informed you of the orders
given to Theramenes and Thrasybulus to take forty-seven ships of war and pick up the shipwrecked
crews, and of the neglect of the two officers to carry out those orders. And it follows that
though the offence was committed by one or two, the responsibility must be shared by all; and
in return for kindness in the past, they are in danger at present of sacrificing their lives
to the machinations of these very men, and others whom I could mention. In danger, do I say,
of losing their lives? No, not so, if you will suffer me to persuade you to do what is just
and right; if you will only adopt such a course as shall enable you best to discover the truth
and shall save you from too late repentance, when you find you have transgressed irremediably
against heaven and your own selves. In what I urge there is no trap nor plot whereby you can
be deceived by me or any other man; it is a straightforward course which will enable you to
discover and punish the offender by whatever process you like, collectively or individually.
Let them have, if not more, at any rate one whole day to make what defence they can for themselves;
and trust to your own unbiased judgment to guide you to the right conclusion.

"You know, men of Athens, the exceeding stringency of the decree of Cannonus, (9) which orders
that man, whosoever he be, who is guilty of treason against the people of Athens, to be put
in irons, and so to meet the charge against him before the people. If he be convicted, he is
to be thrown into the Barathron and perish, and the property of such an one is to be confiscated,
with the exception of the tithe which falls to the goddess. I call upon you to try these generals
in accordance with this decree. Yes, and so help me God--if it please you, begin with my own
kinsman Pericles for base would it be on my part to make him of more account than the whole
of the State. Or, if you prefer, try them by that other law, which is directed against robbers
of temples and betrayers of their country, which says: if a man betray his city or rob a sacred
temple of the gods, he shall be tried before a law court, and if he be convicted, his body
shall not be buried in Attica, and his goods shall be confiscated to the State. Take your choice
as between these two laws, men of Athens, and let the prisoners be tried by one or other. Let
three portions of a day be assigned to each respectively, one portion wherein they shall listen
to their accusation, a second wherein they shall make their defence, and a third wherein you
shall meet and give your votes in due order on the question of their guilt or innocence. By
this procedure the malefactors will receive the desert of their misdeeds in full, and those
who are innocent will owe you, men of Athens, the recovery of their liberty, in place of unmerited
destruction. (10)

 (9) "There was a rule in Attic judicial procedure, called the psephism
    of Kannonus (originally adopted, we do not know when, on the
    proposition of a citizen of that name, as a psephism or decree for
    some particular case, but since generalised into common practice,
    and grown into great prescriptive reverence), which peremptorily
    forbade any such collective trial or sentence, and directed that a
    separate judicial vote should in all cases be taken for or against
    each accused party." Grote, "Hist. of Greece," vol. viii. p. 266
    (2d ed.)

 (10) Reading {adikos apolountai}.

"On your side, in trying the accused by recognised legal procedure, you will show that you
obey the dictates of pious feeling, and can regard the sanctity of an oath, instead of joining
hands with our enemies the Lacedaemonians and fighting their battles. For is it not to fight
their battles, if you take their conquerors, the men who deprived them of seventy vessels,
and at the moment of victory sent them to perdition untried and in the teeth of the law? What
are you afraid of, that you press forward with such hot haste? Do you imagine that you may
be robbed of the power of life and death over whom you please, should you condescend to a legal
trial? but that you are safe if you take shelter behind an illegality, like the illegality
of Callixenus, when he worked upon the senate to propose to this assembly to deal with the
accused by a single vote? But consider, you may actually put to death an innocent man, and
then repentance will one day visit you too late. Bethink you how painful and unavailing remorse
will then be, and more particularly if your error has cost a fellow-creature his life. What
a travesty of justice it would be if in the case of a man like Aristarchus, (11) who first
tried to destroy the democracy and then betrayed Oenoe to our enemy the Thebans, you granted
him a day for his defence, consulting his wishes, and conceded to him all the other benefits
of the law; whereas now you are proposing to deprive of these same privileges your own generals,
who in every way conformed to your views and defeated your enemies. Do not you, of all men,
I implore you, men of Athens, act thus. Why, these laws are your own, to them, beyond all else
you owe your greatness. Guard them jealously; in nothing, I implore you, act without their
sanction.

 (11) See below, II. iii; also cf. Thuc. viii. 90, 98.

"But now, turn for a moment and consider with me the actual occurrences which have created
the suspicion of misconduct on the part of our late generals. The sea-fight had been fought
and won, and the ships had returned to land, when Diomedon urged that the whole squadron should
sail out in line and pick up the wrecks and floating crews. Erasinides was in favour of all
the vessels sailing as fast as possible to deal with the enemy's forces at Mitylene. And Thrasylus
represented that both objects could be effected, by leaving one division of the fleet there,
and with the rest sailing against the enemy; and if this resolution were agreed to, he advised
that each of the eight generals should leave three ships of his own division with the ten vessels
of the taxiarchs, the ten Samian vessels, and the three belonging to the navarchs. These added
together make forty-seven, four for each of the lost vessels, twelve in number. Among the taxiarchs
left behind, two were Thrasybulus and Theramenes, the men who in the late meeting of this assembly
undertook to accuse the generals. With the remainder of the fleet they were to sail to attack
the enemy's fleet. Everything, you must admit, was duly and admirably planned. It was only
common justice, therefore, that those whose duty it was to attack the enemy should render an
account for all miscarriages of operations against the enemy; while those who were commissioned
to pick up the dead and dying should, if they failed to carry out the instructions of the generals,
be put on trial to explain the reasons of the failure. This indeed I may say in behalf of both
parites. It was really the storm which, in spite of what the generals had planned, prevented
anything being done. There are witnesses ready to attest the truth of this: the men who escaped
as by a miracle, and among these one of these very generals, who was on a sinking ship and
was saved. And this man, who needed picking up as much as anybody at that moment, is, they
insist, to be tried by one and the same vote as those who neglected to perform their orders!
Once more, I beg you, men of Athens, to accept your victory and your good fortune, instead
of behaving like the desperate victims of misfortune and defeat. Recognise the finger of divine
necessity; do not incur the reproach of stony-heartedness by discovering treason where there
was merely powerlessness, and condemning as guilty those who were prevented by the storm from
carrying out their instructions. Nay! you will better satisfy the demands of justice by crowning
these conquerors with wreaths of victory than by punishing them with death at the instigation
of wicked men."

At the conclusion of his speech Euryptolemus proposed, as an amendment, that the prisoners
should, in accordance with the decree of Cannonus, be tried each separately, as against the
proposal of the senate to try them all by a single vote.

At the show of hands the tellers gave the majority in favour of Euryptolemus's amendment, but
upon the application of Menecles, who took formal exception (12) to this decision, the show
of hands was gone through again, and now the verdict was in favour of the resolution of the
senate. At a later date the balloting was made, and by the votes recorded the eight generals
were condemned, and the six who were in Athens were put to death.

 (12) For this matter cf. Schomann, "De Comitiis Athen." p. 161 foll.;
    also Grote, "Hist. of Grece," vol. viii. p. 276 note (2d ed.)

Not long after, repentance seized the Athenians, and they passed a decree authorising the public
prosecution of those who had deceived the people, and the appointment of proper securities
for their persons until the trial was over. Callixenus was one of those committed for trail.
There were, besides Callixenus, four others against whom true bills were declared, and they
were all five imprisoned by their sureties. But all subsequently effected their escape before
the trial, at the time of the sedition in which Cleophon (13) was killed. Callixenus eventually
came back when the party in Piraeus returned to the city, at the date of the amnesty, (14)
but only to die of hunger, an object of universal detestation.

BOOK II

I

To return to Eteonicus and his troops in Chios. During summer they were well able to support
themselves on the fruits of the season, or by labouring for hire in different parts of the
island, but with the approach of winter these means of subsistence began to fail. Ill-clad
at the same time, and ill-shod, they fell to caballing and arranging plans to attack the city
of Chios. It was agreed amongst them, that in order to gauge their numbers, every member of
the conspiracy should carry a reed. Eteonicus got wind of the design, but was at a loss how
to deal with it, considering the number of these reed-bearers. To make an open attack upon
them seemed dangerous. It would probably lead to a rush to arms, in which the conspirators
would seize the city and commence hostilities, and, in the event of their success, everything
hitherto achieved would be lost. Or again, the destruction on his part of many fellow-creatures
and allies was a terrible alternative, which would place the Spartans in an unenviable light
with regard to the rest of Hellas, and render the soldiers ill-disposed to the cause in hand.
Accordingly he took with him fifteen men, armed with daggers, and marched through the city.
Falling in with one of the reed-bearers, a man suffering from ophthalmia, who was returning
from the surgeon's house, he put him to death. This led to some uproar, and people asked why
the man was thus slain. By Eteonicus's orders the answer was set afloat, "because he carried
a reed." As the explanation circulated, one reed-bearer after another threw away the symbol,
each one saying to himself, as he heard the reason given, "I have better not be seen with this."
After a while Eteonicus called a meeting of the Chians, and imposed upon them a contribution
of money, on the ground that with pay in their pockets the sailors would have no temptation
to revolutionary projects. The Chians acquiesced. Whereupon Eteonicus promptly ordered his
crews to get on board their vessels. He then rowed alongside each ship in turn, and addressed
the men at some length in terms of encouragement and cheery admonition, just as though he knew
nothing of what had taken place, and so distributed a month's pay to every man on board.

After this the Chians and the other allies held a meeting in Ephesus, and, considering the
present posture of affairs, determined to send ambassadors to Lacedaemon with a statement of
the facts, and a request that Lysander might be sent out to take command of the fleet. Lysander's
high reputation among the allies dated back to his former period of office, when as admiral
he had won the naval victory of Notium. The ambassadors accordingly were despatched, accompanied
by envoys also from Cyrus, charged with the same message. The Lacedaemonians responded by sending
them Lysander as second in command, (1) with Aracus as admiral, since it was contrary to their
custom that the same man should be admiral twice. At the same time the fleet was entrusted
to Lysander. (2)

 (1) Epistoleus. See above.

 (2) "At this date the war had lasted five-and-twenty years." So the
    MSS. read. The words are probably an interpolation.

It was in this year (3) that Cyrus put Autoboesaces and Mitraeus to death. These were sons
of the sister of Dariaeus (4) (the daughter of Xerxes, the father of Darius). (5) He put them
to death for neglecting, when they met him, to thrust their hands into the sleeve (or "kore")
which is a tribute of respect paid to the king alone. This "kore" is longer than the ordinary
sleeve, so long in fact that a man with his hand inside is rendered helpless. In consequence
of this act on the part of Cyrus, Hieramenes (6) and his wife urged upon Dariaeus the danger
of overlooking such excessive insolence on the part of the young prince, and Dariaeus, on the
plea of sickness, sent a special embassy to summon Cyrus to his bedside.

 (3) B.C. 406.

 (4) Dariaeus, i.e. Darius, but the spelling of the name is correct,
    and occurs in Ctesias, though in the "Anabasis" we have the
    spelling Darius.

 (5) These words look like the note of a foolish and ignorant scribe.
    He ought to have written, "The daughter of Artaxerxes and own
    sister of Darius, commonly so called."

 (6) For Hieramenes cf. Thuc. viii. 95, and Prof. Jowett ad loc.

B.C. 405. In the following year (7) Lysander arrived at Ephesus, and sent for Eteonicus with
his ships from Chios, and collected all other vessels elsewhere to be found. His time was now
devoted to refitting the old ships and having new ones built in Antandrus. He also made a journey
to the court of Cyrus with a request for money. All Cyrus could say was, that not only the
money sent by the king was spent, but much more besides; and he pointed out the various sums
which each of the admirals had received, but at the same time he gave him what he asked for.
Furnished with this money, Lysander appointed captains to the different men-of-war, and remitted
to the sailors their arrears of pay. Meanwhile the Athenian generals, on their side, were devoting
their energies to the improvements of their navy at Samos.

 (7) The MSS. add "during the ephorate of Archytas and the archonship
    at Athens of Alexias," which, though correct enough, is probably
    an interpolation.

It was now Cyrus's turn to send for Lysander. It was the moment at which the envoy from his
father had arrived with the message: "Your father is on his sick-bed and desires your presence."
The king lay at Thamneria, in Media, near the territory of the Cadusians, against whom he had
marched to put down a revolt. When Lysander presented himself, Cyrus was urgent with him not
to engage the Athenians at sea unless he had many more ships than they. "The king," he added,
"and I have plenty of wealth, so that, as far as money goes, you can man plenty of vessels."
He then consigned to him all the tributes from the several cities which belonged to him personally,
and gave him the ready money which he had as a gift; and finally, reminding him of the sincere
friendship he entertained towards the state of Lacedaemon, as well as to himself personally,
he set out up country to visit his father. Lysander, finding himself thus left with the complete
control of the property of Cyrus (during the absence of that prince, so summoned to the bedside
of his father), was able to distribute pay to his troops, after which he set sail for the Ceramic
Gulf of Caria. Here he stormed a city in alliance with the Athenians named Cedreae, and on
the following day's assault took it, and reduced the inhabitants to slavery. These were of
a mixed Hellene and barbaric stock. From Cedreae he continued his voyage to Rhodes. The Athenians
meanwhile, using Samos as their base of operations, were employed in devastating the king's
territory, or in swooping down upon Chios and Ephesus, and in general were preparing for a
naval battle, having but lately chosen three new generals in addition to those already in office,
whose names were Menander, Tydeus, and Cephisodotus. Now Lysander, leaving Rhodes, and coasting
along Ionia, made his way to the Hellespont, having an eye to the passage of vessels through
the Straits, and, in a more hostile sense, on the cities which had revolted from Sparta. The
Athenians also set sail from Chios, but stood out to open sea, since the seaboard of Asia was
hostile to them.

Lysander was again on the move; leaving Abydos, he passed up channel to Lampsacus, which town
was allied with Athens; the men of Abydos and the rest of the troops advancing by land, under
the command of the Lacedaemonian Thorax. They then attacked and took by storm the town, which
was wealthy, and with its stores of wine and wheat and other commodities was pillaged by the
soldiery. All free-born persons, however, were without exception released by Lysander. And
now the Athenian fleet, following close on his heels, came to moorings at Elaeus, in the Chersonesus,
one hundred and eighty sail in all. It was not until they had reached this place, and were
getting their early meal, that the news of what had happened at Lampsacus reached them. Then
they instantly set sail again to Sestos, and, having halted long enough merely to take in stores,
sailed on further to Aegospotami, a point facing Lampsacus, where the Hellespont is not quite
two miles (8) broad. Here they took their evening meal.

 (8) Lit. fifteen stades.

The night following, or rather early next morning, with the first streak of dawn, Lysander
gave the signal for the men to take their breakfasts and get on board their vessels; and so,
having got all ready for a naval engagement, with his ports closed and movable bulwarks attached,
he issued the order that no one was to stir from his post or put out to sea. As the sun rose
the Athenians drew up their vessels facing the harbour, in line of battle ready for action;
but Lysander declining to come out to meet them, as the day advanced they retired again to
Aegospotami. Then Lysander ordered the swiftest of his ships to follow the Athenians, and as
soon as the crews had disembarked, to watch what they did, sail back, and report to him. Until
these look-outs returned he would permit no disembarkation from his ships. This performance
he repeated for four successive days, and each day the Athenians put out to sea and challenged
an engagement.

But now Alcibiades, from one of his fortresses, could espy the position of his fellow-countrymen,
moored on an open beach beyond reach of any city, and forced to send for supplies to Sestos,
which was nearly two miles distant, while their enemies were safely lodged in a harbour, with
a city adjoining, and everything within reach. The situation did not please him, and he advised
them to shift their anchorage to Sestos, where they would have the advantage of a harbour and
a city. "Once there," he concluded, "you can engage the enemy whenever it suits you." But the
generals, and more particularly Tydeus and Menander, bade him go about his business. "We are
generals now--not you," they said; and so he went away. And now for five days in succession
the Athenians had sailed out to offer battle, and for the fifth time retired, followed by the
same swift sailors of the enemy. But this time Lysander's orders to the vessels so sent in
pursuit were, that as soon as they saw the enemy's crew fairly disembarked and dispersed along
the shores of the Chersonesus (a practice, it should be mentioned, which had grown upon them
from day to day owing to the distance at which eatables had to be purchased, and out of sheer
contempt, no doubt, of Lysander, who refused to accept battle), they were to begin their return
voyage, and when in mid-channel to hoist a shield. The orders were punctually carried out,
and Lysander at once signalled to his whole squadron to put across with all speed, while Thorax,
with the land forces, was to march parallel with the fleet along the coast. Aware of the enemy's
fleet, which he could see bearing down upon him, Conon had only time to signal to the crews
to join their ships and rally to the rescue with all their might. But the men were scattered
far and wide, and some of the vessels had only two out of their three banks of rowers, some
only a single one, while others again were completely empty. Conon's own ship, with seven others
in attendance on him and the "Paralus," (9) put out to sea, a little cluster of nine vessels,
with their full complement of men; but every one of the remaining one hundred and seventy-one
vessels were captured by Lysander on the beach. As to the men themselves, the large majority
of them were easily made prisoners on shore, a few only escaping to the small fortresses of
the neighbourhood. Meanwhile Conon and his nine vessels made good their escape. For himself,
knowing that the fortune of Athens was ruined, he put into Abarnis, the promontory of Lampsacus,
and there picked up the great sails of Lysander's ships, and then with eight ships set sail
himself to seek refuge with Evagoras in Cyprus, while the "Paralus" started for Athens with
tidings of what had taken place.

 (9) The "Paralus"--the Athenian sacred vessel; cf. Thuc. iii. 33 et
    passim.

Lysander, on his side, conveyed the ships and prisoners and all other spoil back to Lampsacus,
having on board some of the Athenian generals, notably Philocles and Adeimantus. On the very
day of these achievements he despatched Theopompus, a Milesian privateersman, to Lacedaemon
to report what had taken place. This envoy arrived within three days and delivered his message.
Lysander's next step was to convene the allies and bid them deliberate as to the treatment
of the prisoners. Many were the accusations here levied against the Athenians. There was talk
of crimes committed against the law of Hellas, and of cruelties sanctioned by popular decrees;
which, had they conquered in the late sea-fight, would have been carried out; such as the proposal
to cut off the right hand of every prisoner taken alive, and lastly the ill-treatment of two
captured men-of-war, a Corinthian and an Andrian vessel, when every man on board had been hurled
headlong down the cliff. Philocles was the very general of the Athenians who had so ruthlessly
destroyed those men. Many other tales were told; and at length a resolution was passed to put
all the Athenian prisoners, with the exception of Adeimantus, to death. He alone, it was pleaded,
had taken exception to the proposal to cut off the prisoners' hands. On the other hand, he
was himself accused by some people of having betrayed the fleet. As to Philocles, Lysander
put to him one question, as the officer who had thrown (10) the Corinthians and Andrians down
the cliff: What fate did the man deserve to suffer who had embarked on so cruel a course of
illegality against Hellenes? and so delivered him to the executioner.

II

When he had set the affairs of Lampsacus in order, Lysander sailed to Byzantium and Chalcedon,
where the inhabitants, having first dismissed the Athenian garrison under a flag of truce,
admitted him within their walls. Those citizens of Byzantium, who had betrayed Byzantium into
the hands of Alcibiades, fled as exiles into Pontus, but subsequently betaking themselves to
Athens, became Athenian citizens. In dealing with the Athenian garrisons, and indeed with all
Athenians wheresoever found, Lysander made it a rule to give them safe conduct to Athens, and
to Athens only, in the certainty that the larger the number collected within the city and Piraeus,
the more quickly the want of necessaries of life would make itself felt. And now, leaving Sthenelaus,
a Laconian, as governor-general of Byzantium and Chalcedon, he sailed back himself to Lampsacus
and devoted himself to refitting his ships.

It was night when the "Paralus" reached Athens with her evil tidings, on receipt of which a
bitter wail of woe broke forth. From Piraeus, following the line of the long walls up to the
heart of the city, it swept and swelled, as each man to his neighbour passed on the news. On
that night no man slept. There was mourning and sorrow for those that were lost, but the lamentation
for the dead was merged in even deeper sorrow for themselves, as they pictured the evils they
were about to suffer, the like of which they themselves had inflicted upon the men of Melos,
who were colonists of the Lacedaemonians, when they mastered them by siege. Or on the men of
Histiaea; on Scione and Torone; on the Aeginetans, and many another Hellene city. (1) On the
following day the public assembly met, and, after debate, it was resolved to block up all the
harbours save one, to put the walls in a state of defence, to post guards at various points,
and to make all other necessary preparations for a siege. Such were the concerns of the men
of Athens.

 (1) With regard to these painful recollections, see (1) for the siege
    and surrender of Melos (in B.C. 416), Thuc. v. 114, 116; and cf.
    Aristoph. "Birds," 186; Plut. ("Lysander," 14); (2) for the
    ejection of the Histiaeans, an incident of the recovery of Euboea
    in 445 B.C., see Thuc. i. 14; Plut. ("Pericles," 23); (3) for the
    matter of Scione, which revolted in 423 B.C., and was for a long
    time a source of disagreement between the Athenians and
    Lacedaemonians, until finally captured by the former in 421 B.C.,
    when the citizens were slain and the city given to the Plataeans,
    see Thuc. iv. 120-122, 129-133; v. 18, 32; (4) for Torone see
    Thuc. ib., and also v. 3; (5) for the expulsion of the Aeginetans
    in 431 B.C. see Thuc. ii. 27.

Lysander presently left the Hellespont with two hundred sail and arrived at Lesbos, where he
established a new order of things in Mitylene and the other cities of the island. Meanwhile
he despatched Eteonicus with a squadron of ten ships to the northern coasts, (2) where that
officer brought about a revolution of affairs which placed the whole region in the hands of
Lacedaemon. Indeed, in a moment of time, after the sea-fight, the whole of Hellas had revolted
from Athens, with the solitary exception of the men of Samos. These, having massacred the notables,
(3) held the state under their control. After a while Lysander sent messages to Agis at Deceleia,
and to Lacedaemon, announcing his approach with a squadron of two hundred sail.

 (2) Lit. "the Thraceward districts." See above, p. 16.

 (3) Or, "since they had slain their notables, held the state under
    popular control." See Grote, "Hist. of Greece," vol. viii. p. 303
    note 3 (2d ed.), who thinks that the incident referred to is the
    violent democratic revolution in Samos described in Thuc. viii.
    21, B.C. 412.

In obedience to a general order of Pausanias, the other king of Lacedaemon, a levy in force
of the Lacedaemonians and all the rest of Peloponnesus, except the Argives, was set in motion
for a campaign. As soon as the several contingents had arrived, the king put himself at their
head and marched against Athens, encamping in the gymnasium of the Academy, (4) as it is called.
Lysander had now reached Aegina, where, having got together as many of the former inhabitants
as possible, he formally reinstated them in their city; and what he did in behalf of the Aeginetans,
he did also in behalf of the Melians, and of the rest who had been deprived of their countries.
He then pillaged the island of Salamis, and finally came to moorings off Piraeus with one hundred
and fifty ships of the line, and established a strict blockade against all merchant ships entering
that harbour.

 (4) For this most illustrious of Athenian gymnasia, which still
    retains its name, see Leake, "Topography of Athens," i. 195 foll.

The Athenians, finding themselves besieged by land and sea, were in sore perplexity what to
do. Without ships, without allies, without provisions, the belief gained hold upon them that
there was no way of escape. They must now, in their turn, suffer what they had themselves inflincted
upon others; not in retaliation, indeed, for ills received, but out of sheer insolence, overriding
the citizens of petty states, and for no better reason than that these were allies of the very
men now at their gates. In this frame of mind they enfranchised those who at any time had lost
their civil rights, and schooled themselves to endurance; and, albeit many succumbed to starvation,
no thought of truce or reconciliation with their foes was breathed. (5) But when the stock
of corn was absolutely insufficient, they sent an embassage to Agis, proposing to become allies
of the Lacedaemonians on the sole condition of keeping their fortification walls and Piraeus;
and to draw up articles of treaty on these terms. Agis bade them betake themselves to Lacedaemon,
seeing that he had no authority to act himself. With this answer the ambassadors returned to
Athens, and were forthwith sent on to Lacedaemon. On reaching Sellasia, (6) a town in (7) Laconian
territory, they waited till they got their answer from the ephors, who, having learnt their
terms (which were identical to those already proposed to Agis), bade them instantly to be gone,
and, if they really desired peace, to come with other proposals, the fruit of happier reflection.
Thus the ambassadors returned home, and reported the result of their embassage, whereupon despondency
fell upon all. It was a painful reflection that in the end they would be sold into slavery;
and meanwhile, pending the return of a second embassy, many must needs fall victims to starvation.
The razing of their fortifications was not a solution which any one cared to recommend. A senator,
Archestratus, had indeed put the question in the senate, whether it were not best to make peace
with the Lacedaemonians on such terms as they were willing to propose; but he was thrown into
prison. The Laconian proposals referred to involved the destruction of both long walls for
a space of more than a mile. And a decree had been passed, making it illegal to submit any
such proposition about the walls. Things having reached this pass, Theramenes made a proposal
in the public assembly as follows: If they chose to send him as an ambassador to Lysander,
he would go and find out why the Lacedaemonians were so unyielding about the walls; whether
it was they really intended to enslave the city, or merely that they wanted a guarantee of
good faith. Despatched accordingly, he lingered on with Lysander for three whole months and
more, watching for the time when the Athenians, at the last pinch of starvation, would be willing
to accede to any terms that might be offered. At last, in the fourth month, he returned and
reported to the public assembly that Lysander had detained him all this while, and had ended
by bidding him betake himself to Lacedaemon, since he had no authority himself to answer his
questions, which must be addressed directly to the ephors. After this Theramenes was chosen
with nine others to go to Lacedaemon as ambassadors with full powers. Meanwhile Lysander had
sent an Athenian exile, named Aristoteles, in company of certain Lacedaemonians, to Sparta
to report to the board of ephors how he had answered Theramenes, that they, and they alone,
had supreme authority in matters of peace and war.

 (5) Or, "they refused to treat for peace."

 (6) Sellasia, the bulwark of Sparta in the valley of the Oenus.

 (7) The MSS. have "in the neighbourhood of," which words are
    inappropriate at this date, though they may well have been added
    by some annotator after the Cleomenic war and the battle of
    Sellasia, B.C. 222, when Antigonus of Macedon destroyed the place
    in the interests of the Achaean League.

Theramenes and his companions presently reached Sellasia, and being there questioned as to
the reason of their visit, replied that they had full powers to treat of peace. After which
the ephors ordered them to be summoned to their presence. On their arrival a general assembly
was convened, in which the Corinthians and Thebans more particularly, though their views were
shared by many other Hellenes also, urged the meeting not to come to terms with the Athenians,
but to destroy them. The Lacedaemonians replied that they would never reduce to slavery a city
which was itself an integral portion of Hellas, and had performed a great and noble service
to Hellas in the most perilous of emergencies. On the contrary, they were willing to offer
peace on the terms now specified--namely, "That the long walls and the fortifications of Piraeus
should be destroyed; that the Athenian fleet, with the exception of twelve vessels, should
be surrendered; that the exiles should be restored; and lastly, that the Athenians should acknowledge
the headship of Sparta in peace and war, leaving to her the choice of friends and foes, and
following her lead by land and sea." Such were the terms which Theramenes and the rest who
acted with him were able to report on their return to Athens. As they entered the city, a vast
crowd met them, trembling lest their mission have proved fruitless. For indeed delay was no
longer possible, so long already was the list of victims daily perishing from starvation. On
the day following, the ambassadors delivered their report, stating the terms upon which the
Lacedaemonians were willing to make peace. Theramenes acted as spokesman, insisting that they
ought to obey the Lacedaemonians and pull down the walls. A small minority raised their voice
in opposition, but the majority were strongly in favour of the proposition, and the resolution
was passed to accept the peace. After that, Lysander sailed into the Piraeus, and the exiles
were readmitted. And so they fell to levelling the fortifications and walls with much enthusiasm,
to the accompaniment of female flute-players, deeming that day the beginning of liberty to Greece.

Thus the year drew to its close (8)--during its middle months took place the accession of Dionysius,
the son of Hermocrates the Syracusan, to the tyranny of Syracuse; an incident itself preceded
by a victory gained over the Carthaginians by the Syracusans; the reduction of Agrigentum through
famine by the Carthaginians themselves; and the exodus of the Sicilian Greeks from that city.

 (8) For the puzzling chronology of this paragraph see Grote, "Hist. of
    Greece," vol. x. p 619 (2d ed.) If genuine, the words may perhaps
    have slipt out of their natural place in chapter i. above, in
    front of the words "in the following year Lysander arrived," etc.
    L. Dindorf brackets them as spurious. Xen., "Hist. Gr." ed.

B.C. 404. In the following year (1) the people passed a resolution to choose thirty men who
were to draft a constitution based on the ancestral laws of the State. The following were chosen
to act on this committee:--Polychares, Critias, Melobius, Hippolochus, Eucleides, Hiero, Mnesilochus,
Chremo, Theramenes, Aresias, Diocles, Phaedrias, Chaereleos, Anaetius, Piso, Sophocles, Erastosthenes,
Charicles, Onomacles, Theognis, Aeschines, Theogones, Cleomedes, Erasistratus, Pheido, Dracontides,
Eumathes, Aristoteles, Hippomachus, Mnesitheides. After these transactions, Lysander set sail
for Samos; and Agis withdrew the land force from Deceleia and disbanded the troops, dismissing
the contingents to their several cities.

 (1) The MSS. here add "it was that year of the Olympiad cycle in which
    Crocinas, a Thessalian, won the Stadium; when Endius was ephor at
    Sparta, and Pythodorus archon at Athens, though the Athenians
    indeed do not call the year by that archon's name, since he was
    elected during the oligarchy, but prefer to speak of the year of
    'anarchy'; the aforesaid oligarchy originated thus,"--which,
    though correct, probably was not written by Xenophon. The year of
    anarchy might perhaps be better rendered "the year without
    archons."

In was at this date, about the time of the solar eclipse, (2) that Lycophron of Pherae, who
was ambitious of ruling over the whole of Thessaly, defeated those sections of the Thessalians
who opposed him, such as the men of Larissa and others, and slew many of them. It was also
about this date that Dionysius, now tyrant of Syracuse, was defeated by the Carthaginians and
lost Gela and Camarina. And again, a little later, the men of Leontini, who previously had
been amalgamated with the Syracusans, separated themselves from Syracuse and Dionysius, and
asserted their independence, and returned to their native city. Another incident of this period
was the sudden despatch and introduction of Syracusan horse into Catana by Dionysius.

 (2) This took place on 2d September B.C. 404.

Now the Samians, though besieged by Lysander on all sides, were at first unwilling to come
to terms. But at the last moment, when Lysander was on the point of assaulting the town, they
accepted the terms, which allowed every free man to leave the island, but not to carry away
any part of his property, except the clothes on his back. On these conditions they marched
out. The city and all it contained was then delivered over to its ancient citizens by Lysander,
who finally appointed ten governors to garrison the island. (3) After which, he disbanded the
allied fleet, dismissing them to their respective cities, while he himself, with the Lacedaemonian
squadron, set sail for Laconia, bringing with him the prows of the conquered vessels and the
whole navy of Piraeus, with the exception of twelve ships. He also brought the crowns which
he had received from the cities as private gifts, and a sum of four hundred and seventy talents
(4) in silver (the surplus of the tribute money which Cyrus had assigned to him for the prosecution
of the war), besides other property, the fruit of his military exploits. All these things Lysander
delivered to the Lacedaemonians in the latter end of summer. (5)

 (3) A council of ten, or "decarchy." See Grote, "H. G." viii. 323 (1st
    ed.)

 (4) About 112,800 pounds.

 (5) The MSS. add "a summer, the close of which coincided with the
    termination of a war which had lasted twenty-eight and a half
    years, as the list of annual ephors, appended in order, serves to
    show. Aenesias is the first name. The war began during his
    ephorate, in the fifteenth year of the thirty years' truce after
    the capture of Euboea. His successors were Brasidas, Isanor,
    Sostratidas, Exarchus, Agesistratus, Angenidas, Onomacles,
    Zeuxippus, Pityas, Pleistolas, Cleinomachus, Harchus, Leon,
    Chaerilas, Patesiadas, Cleosthenes, Lycarius, Eperatus,
    Onomantius, Alexippidas, Misgolaidas, Isias, Aracus, Euarchippus,
    Pantacles, Pityas, Archytas, and lastly, Endius, during whose year
    of office Lysander sailed home in triumph, after performing the
    exploits above recorded,"--the interpolation, probably, of some
    editor or copyist, the words "twenty-eight and a half" being
    probably a mistake on his part for "twenty-seven and a half." Cf.
    Thuc. v. 26; also Buchsenschutz, Einleitung, p. 8 of his school
    edition of the "Hellenica."

The Thirty had been chosen almost immediately after the long walls and the fortifications round
Piraeus had been razed. They were chosen for the express purpose of compiling a code of laws
for the future constitution of the State. The laws were always on the point of being published,
yet they were never forthcoming; and the thirty compilers contented themselves meanwhile with
appointing a senate and the other magistracies as suited their fancy best. That done, they
turned their attention, in the first instance, to such persons as were well known to have made
their living as informers (6) under the democracy, and to be thorns in the side of all respectable
people. These they laid hold on and prosecuted on the capital charge. The new senate gladly
recorded its vote of condemnation against them; and the rest of the world, conscious of bearing
no resemblance to them, seemed scarcely vexed. But the Thirty did not stop there. Presently
they began to deliberate by what means they could get the city under their absolute control,
in order that they might work their will upon it. Here again they proceeded tentatively; in
the first instance, they sent (two of their number), Aeschines and Aristoteles, to Lacedaemon,
and persuaded Lysander to support them in getting a Lacedaemonian garrison despatched to Athens.
They only needed it until they had got the "malignants" out of the way, and had established
the constitution; and they would undertake to maintain these troops at their own cost. Lysander
was not deaf to their persuasions, and by his co-operation their request was granted. A bodyguard,
with Callibius as governor, was sent.

 (6) Lit. "by sycophancy," i.e. calumnious accusation--the sycophant's
    trade. For a description of this pest of Athenian life cf. "Dem."
    in Arist. 1, S. 52; quoted in Jebb, "Attic Orators," chap. xxix.
    14; cf. Aristoph. "Ach." 904; Xen. "Mem." II. ix. 1.

And now that they had got the garrison, they fell to flattering Callibius with all servile
flattery, in order that he might give countenance to their doings. Thus they prevailed on him
to allow some of the guards, whom they selected, to accompany them, while they proceeded to
lay hands on whom they would; no longer confining themselves to base folk and people of no
account, but boldly laying hands on those who they felt sure would least easily brook being
thrust aside, or, if a spirit of opposition seized them, could command the largest number of
partisans.

These were early days; as yet Critias was of one mind with Theramenes, and the two were friends.
But the time came when, in proportion as Critias was ready to rush headlong into wholesale
carnage, like one who thirsted for the blood of the democracy, which had banished him, Theramenes
balked and thwarted him. It was barely reasonable, he argued, to put people to death, who had
never done a thing wrong to respectable people in their lives, simply because they had enjoyed
influence and honour under the democracy. "Why, you and I, Critias," he would add, "have said
and done many things ere now for the sake of popularity." To which the other (for the terms
of friendly intimacy still subsisted) would retort, "There is no choice left to us, since we
intend to take the lion's share, but to get rid of those who are best able to hinder us. If
you imagine, because we are thirty instead of one, our government requires one whit the less
careful guarding than an actual tyranny, you must be very innocent."

So things went on. Day after day the list of persons put to death for no just reason grew longer.
Day after day the signs of resentment were more significant in the groups of citizens banding
together and forecasting the character of this future constitution; till at length Theramenes
spoke again, protesting:--There was no help for it but to associate with themselves a sufficient
number of persons in the conduct of affairs, or the oligarchy would certainly come to an end.
Critias and the rest of the Thirty, whose fears had already converted Theramenes into a dangerous
popular idol, proceeded at once to draw up a list of three thousand citizens; fit and proper
persons to have a share in the conduct of affairs. But Theramenes was not wholly satisfied,
"indeed he must say, for himself, he regarded it as ridiculous, that in their effort to associate
the better classes with themselves in power, they should fix on just that particular number,
three thousand, as if that figure had some necessary connection with the exact number of gentlemen
in the State, making it impossible to discover any respectability outside or rascality within
the magic number. And in the second place," he continued, "I see we are trying to do two things,
diametrically opposed; we are manufacturing a government, which is based on force, and at the
same time inferior in strength to those whom we propose to govern." That was what he said,
but what his colleagues did, was to institute a military inspection or review. The Three Thousand
were drawn up in the Agora, and the rest of the citizens, who were not included in the list,
elsewhere in various quarters of the city. The order to take arms was given; (7) but while
the men's backs were turned, at the bidding of the Thirty, the Laconian guards, with those
of the citizens who shared their views, appeared on the scene and took away the arms of all
except the Three Thousand, carried them up to the Acropolis, and safely deposited them in the
temple.

 (7) Or, "a summons to the 'place d'armes' was given; but." Or, "the
    order to seize the arms was given, and." It is clear from
    Aristoph. "Acharn." 1050, that the citizens kept their weapons at
    home. On the other hand, it was a custom not to come to any
    meeting in arms. See Thuc. vi. 58. It seems probable that while
    the men were being reviewed in the market-place and elsewhere, the
    ruling party gave orders to seize their weapons (which they had
    left at home), and this was done except in the case of the Three
    Thousand. Cf. Arnold, "Thuc." II. 2. 5; and IV. 91.

The ground being thus cleared, as it were, and feeling that they had it in their power to do
what they pleased, they embarked on a course of wholesale butchery, to which many were sacrificed
to the merest hatred, many to the accident of possessing riches. Presently the question rose,
How they were to get money to pay their guards? and to meet this difficulty a resolution was
passed empowering each of the committee to seize on one of the resident aliens apiece, to put
his victim to death, and to confiscate his property. Theramenes was invited, or rather told
to seize some one or other. "Choose whom you will, only let it be done." To which he made answer,
it hardly seemed to him a noble or worthy course on the part of those who claimed to be the
elite of society to go beyond the informers (8) in injustice. "Yesterday they, to-day we; with
this difference, the victim of the informer must live as a source of income; our innocents
must die that we may get their wealth. Surely their method was innocent in comparison with ours."

 (8) See above.

The rest of the Thirty, who had come to regard Theramenes as an obstacle to any course they
might wish to adopt, proceeded to plot against him. They addressed themselves to the members
of the senate in private, here a man and there a man, and denounced him as the marplot of the
constitution. Then they issued an order to the young men, picking out the most audacious characters
they could find, to be present, each with a dagger hidden in the hollow of the armpit; and
so called a meeting of the senate. When Theramenes had taken his place, Critias got up and
addressed the meeting:

"If," said he, "any member of this council, here seated, imagines that an undue amount of blood
has been shed, let me remind him that with changes of constitution such things can not be avoided.
It is the rule everywhere, but more particularly at Athens it was inevitable there should be
found a specially large number of persons sworn foes to any constitutional change in the direction
of oligarchy, and this for two reasons. First, because the population of this city, compared
with other Hellenic cities, is enormously large; and again, owing to the length of time during
which the people has battened upon liberty. Now, as to two points we are clear. The first is
that democracy is a form of government detestable to persons like ourselves--to us and to you;
the next is that the people of Athens could never be got to be friendly to our friends and
saviours, the Lacedaemonians. But on the loyalty of the better classes the Lacedaemonians can
count. And that is our reason for establishing an oligarchical constitution with their concurrence.
That is why we do our best to rid us of every one whom we perceive to be opposed to the oligarchy;
and, in our opinion, if one of ourselves should elect to undermine this constitution of ours,
he would deserve punishment. Do you not agree? And the case," he continued, "is no imaginary
one. The offender is here present--Theramenes. And what we say of him is, that he is bent upon
destroying yourselves and us by every means in his power. These are not baseless charges; but
if you will consider it, you will find them amply established in this unmeasured censure of
the present posture of affairs, and his persistent opposition to us, his colleagues, if ever
we seek to get rid of any of these demagogues. Had this been his guiding principle of action
from the beginning, in spite of hostility, at least he would have escaped all imputation of
villainy. Why, this is the very man who originated our friendly and confidential relations
with Lacedaemon. This is the very man who authorised the abolition of the democracy, who urged
us on to inflict punishment on the earliest batch of prisoners brought before us. But to-day
all is changed; now you and we are out of odour with the people, and he accordingly has ceased
to be pleased with our proceedings. The explanation is obvious. In case of a catastrophe, how
much pleasanter for him once again to light upon his legs, and leave us to render account for
our past performances.

"I contend that this man is fairly entitled to render his account also, not only as an ordinary
enemy, but as a traitor to yourselves and us. And let us add, not only is treason more formidable
than open war, in proportion as it is harder to guard against a hidden assassin than an open
foe, but it bears the impress of a more enduring hostility, inasmuch as men fight their enemies
and come to terms with them again and are fast friends; but whoever heard of reconciliation
with a traitor? There he stands unmasked; he has forfeited our confidence for evermore. But
to show you that these are no new tactics of his, to prove to you that he is a traitor in grain,
I will recall to your memories some points in his past history.

"He began by being held in high honour by the democracy; but taking a leaf out of his father's,
Hagnon's, book, he next showed a most headlong anxiety to transform the democracy into the
Four Hundred, and, in fact, for a time held the first place in that body. But presently, detecting
the formation of rival power to the oligarchs, round he shifted; and we find him next a ringleader
of the popular party in assailing them. It must be admitted, he has well earned his nickname
'Buskin.' (9) Yes, Theramenes! clever you may be, but the man who deserves to live should not
show his cleverness in leading on his associates into trouble, and when some obstacle presents
itself, at once veer round; but like a pilot on shipboard, he ought then to redouble his efforts,
until the wind is fair. Else, how in the name of wonderment are those mariners to reach the
haven where they would be, if at the first contrary wind or tide they turn about and sail in
the opposite direction? Death and destruction are concomitants of constitutional changes and
revolution, no doubt; but you are such an impersonation of change, that, as you twist and turn
and double, you deal destruction on all sides. At one swoop you are the ruin of a thousand
oligarchs at the hands of the people, and at another of a thousand democrats at the hands of
the better classes. Why, sirs, this is the man to whom the orders were given by the generals,
in the sea-fight off Lesbos, to pick up the crews of the disabled vessels; and who, neglecting
to obey orders, turned round and accused the generals; and to save himself murdered them! What,
I ask you, of a man who so openly studied the art of self-seeking, deaf alike to the pleas
of honour and to the claims of friendship? Would not leniency towards such a creature be misplaced?
Can it be our duty at all to spare him? Ought we not rather, when we know the doublings of
his nature, to guard against them, lest we enable him presently to practise on ourselves? The
case is clear. We therefore hereby cite this man before you, as a conspirator and traitor against
yourselves and us. The reasonableness of our conduct, one further reflection may make clear.
No one, I take it, will dispute the splendour, the perfection of the Laconian constitution.
Imagine one of the ephors there in Sparta, in lieu of devoted obedience to the majority, taking
on himself to find fault with the government and to oppose all measures. Do you not think that
the ephors themselves, and the whole commonwealth besides, would hold this renegade worthy
of condign punishment? So, too, by the same token, if you are wise, do you spare yourselves,
not him. For what does the alternative mean? I will tell you. His preservation will cause the
courage of many who hold opposite views to your own to rise; his destruction will cut off the
last hopes of all your enemies, whether within or without the city."

 (9) An annotator seems to have added here the words, occurring in the
    MSS., "the buskin which seems to fit both legs equally, but is
    constant to neither," unless, indeed, they are an original
    "marginal note" of the author. For the character of Theramenes, as
    popularly conceived, cf. Aristoph. "Frogs," 538, 968 foll., and
    Thuc. viii. 92; and Prof. Jowett, "Thuc." vol. ii. pp. 523, 524.

With these words he sat down, but Theramenes rose and said: "Sirs, with your permission I will
first touch upon the charge against me which Critias has mentioned last. The assertion is that
as the accuser of the generals I was their murderer. Now I presume it was not I who began the
attack upon them, but it was they who asserted that in spite of the orders given me I had neglected
to pick up the unfortunates in the sea-fight off Lesbos. All I did was to defend myself. My
defence was that the storm was too violent to permit any vessel to ride at sea, much more therefore
to pick up the men, and this defence was accepted by my fellow-citizens as highly reasonable,
while the generals seemed to be condemned out of their own mouths. For while they kept on asserting
that it was possible to save the men, the fact still remained that they abandoned them to their
fate, set sail, and were gone.

"However, I am not surprised, I confess, at this grave misconception (10) on the part of Critias,
for at the date of these occurrences he was not in Athens. He was away in Thessaly, laying
the foundations of a democracy with Prometheus, and arming the Penestae (11) against their
masters. Heaven forbid that any of his transactions there should be re-enacted here. However,
I must say, I do heartily concur with him on one point. Whoever desires to exclude you from
the government, or to strength the hands of your secret foes, deserves and ought to meet with
condign punishment; but who is most capable of so doing? That you will best discover, I think,
by looking a little more closely into the past and the present conduct of each of us. Well,
then! up to the moment at which you were formed into a senatorial body, when the magistracies
were appointed, and certain notorious 'informers' were brought to trial, we all held the same
views. But later on, when our friends yonder began to hale respectable honest folk to prison
and to death, I, on my side, began to differ from them. From the moment when Leon of Salamis,
(12) a man of high and well-deserved reputation, was put to death, though he had not committed
the shadow of a crime, I knew that all his equals must tremble for themselves, and, so trembling,
be driven into opposition to the new constitution. In the same way, when Niceratus, (13) the
son of Nicias, was arrested; a wealthy man, who, no more than his father, had never done anything
that could be called popular or democratic in his life; it did not require much insight to
discover that his compeers would be converted into our foes. But to go a step further: when
it came to Antiphon (14) falling at our hands--Antiphon, who during the war contributed two
fast-sailing men-of-war out of his own resources, it was then plain to me, that all who had
ever been zealous and patriotic must eye us with suspicion. Once more I could not help speaking
out in opposition to my colleagues when they suggested that each of us ought to seize some
one resident alien. (15) For what could be more certain than that their death-warrant would
turn the whole resident foreign population into enemies of the constitution. I spoke out again
when they insisted on depriving the populace of their arms; it being no part of my creed that
we ought to take the strength out of the city; nor, indeed, so far as I could see, had the
Lacedaemonians stept between us and destruction merely that we might become a handful of people,
powerless to aid them in the day of need. Had that been their object, they might have swept
us away to the last man. A few more weeks, or even days, would have sufficed to extinguish
us quietly by famine. Nor, again, can I say that the importation of mercenary foreign guards
was altogether to my taste, when it would have been so easy for us to add to our own body a
sufficient number of fellow-citizens to ensure our supremacy as governors over those we essayed
to govern. But when I saw what an army of malcontents this government had raised up within
the city walls, besides another daily increasing host of exiles without, I could not but regard
the banishment of people like Thrasybulus and Anytus and Alcibiades (16) as impolitic. Had
our object been to strengthen the rival power, we could hardly have set about it better than
by providing the populace with the competent leaders whom they needed, and the would-be leaders
themselves with an army of willing adherents.

    first Oligarchy, betrayed his own closest friends, Antiphon and
    Archeptolemus. See Prof. Jebb, "Attic Orators," I. x. p. 266.

    Alcibiades, the defendant in this case (B.C. 397 probably) has
    occasion to make, he reminds the court, that under the Thirty,
    others were banished from Athens, but his father was driven out of
    the civilised world of Hellas itself, and finally murdered. See
    Plutarch, "Alcibiades," ad fin.

"I ask then is the man who tenders such advice in the full light of day justly to be regarded
as a traitor, and not as a benefactor? Surely Critias, the peacemaker, the man who hinders
the creation of many enemies, whose counsels tend to the acquistion of yet more friends, (17)
cannot be accused of strengthening the hands of the enemy. Much more truly may the imputation
be retorted on those who wrongfully appropriate their neighbours' goods and put to death those
who have done no wrong. These are they who cause our adversaries to grow and multiply, and
who in very truth are traitors, not to their friends only, but to themselves, spurred on by
sordid love of gain.

 (17) Or, "the peacemaker, the healer of differences, the cementer of
    new alliances, cannot," etc.

"I might prove the truth of what I say in many ways, but I beg you to look at the matter thus.
With which condition of affairs here in Athens do you think will Thrasybulus and Anytus and
the other exiles be the better pleased? That which I have pictured as desirable, or that which
my colleagues yonder are producing? For my part I cannot doubt but that, as things now are,
they are saying to themselves, 'Our allies muster thick and fast.' But were the real strength,
the pith and fibre of this city, kindly disposed to us, they would find it an uphill task even
to get a foothold anywhere in the country.

"Then, with regard to what he said of me and my propensity to be for ever changing sides, let
me draw your attention to the following facts. Was it not the people itself, the democracy,
who voted the constitution of the Four Hundred? This they did, because they had learned to
think that the Lacedaemonians would trust any other form of government rather than a democracy.
But when the efforts of Lacedaemon were not a whit relaxed, when Aristoteles, Melanthius, and
Aristarchus, (18) and the rest of them acting as generals, were plainly minded to construct
an intrenched fortress on the mole for the purpose of admitting the enemy, and so getting the
city under the power of themselves and their associates; (19) because I got wind of these schemes,
and nipped them in the bud, is that to be a traitor to one's friends?

 (18) Cf. Thuc. viii. 90-92, for the behaviour of the Lacedaemonian
    party at Athens and the fortification of Eetioneia in B.C. 411.

 (19) I.e. of the political clubs.

"Then he threw in my teeth the nickname 'Buskin,' as descriptive of an endeavour on my part
to fit both parties. But what of the man who pleases neither? What in heaven's name are we
to call him? Yes! you--Critias? Under the democracy you were looked upon as the most arrant
hater of the people, and under the aristocracy you have proved yourself the bitterest foe of
everything respectable. Yes! Critias, I am, and ever have been, a foe of those who think that
a democracy cannot reach perfection until slaves and those who, from poverty, would sell the
city for a drachma, can get their drachma a day. (20) But not less am I, and ever have been,
a pronounced opponent of those who do not think there can possibly exist a perfect oligarchy
until the State is subjected to the despotism of a few. On the contrary, my own ambition has
been to combine with those who are rich enough to possess a horse and shield, and to use them
for the benefit of the State. (21) That was my ideal in the old days, and I hold to it without
a shadow of turning still. If you can imagine when and where, in conjunction with despots or
demagogues, I have set to my hand to deprive honest gentlefolk of their citizenship, pray speak.
If you can convict me of such crimes at present, or can prove my perpetration of them in the
past, I admit that I deserve to die, and by the worst of deaths."

 (20) I.e. may enjoy the senatorial stipend of a drachma a day = 9 3/4
    pence.

 (21) See Thuc. viii. 97, for a momentary realisation of that "duly
    attempered compound of Oligarchy and Democracy" which Thucydides
    praises, and which Theramenes here refers to. It threw the power
    into the hands of the wealthier upper classes to the exclusion of
    the {nautikos okhlos}. See Prof. Jowett, vol. ii. note, ad loc.
    cit.

With these words he ceased, and the loud murmur of the applause which followed marked the favourable
impression produced upon the senate. It was plain to Critias, that if he allowed his adversary's
fate to be decided by formal voting, Theramenes would escape, and life to himself would become
intolerable. Accordingly he stepped forward and spoke a word or two in the ears of the Thirty.
This done, he went out and gave an order to the attendants with the daggers to stand close
to the bar in full view of the senators. Again he entered and addressed the senate thus: "I
hold it to be the duty of a good president, when he sees the friends about him being made the
dupes of some delusion, to intervene. That at any rate is what I propose to do. Indeed our
friends here standing by the bar say that if we propose to acquit a man so openly bent upon
the ruin of the oligarchy, they do not mean to let us do so. Now there is a clause in the new
code forbidding any of the Three Thousand to be put to death without your vote; but the Thirty
have power of life and death over all outside that list. Accordingly," he proceeded, "I herewith
strike this man, Theramenes, off the list; and this with the concurrence of my colleagues.
And now," he continued, "we condemn him to death."

Hearing these words Theramenes sprang upon the altar of Hestia, exclaiming: "And I, sirs, supplicate
you for the barest forms of law and justice. Let it not be in the power of Critias to strike
off either me, or any one of you whom he will. But in my case, in what may be your case, if
we are tried, let our trial be in accordance with the law they have made concerning those on
the list. I know," he added, "but too well, that this altar will not protect me; but I will
make it plain that these men are as impious towards the gods as they are nefarious towards
men. Yet I do marvel, good sirs and honest gentlemen, for so you are, that you will not help
yourselves, and that too when you must see that the name of every one of you is as easily erased
as mine."

But when he had got so far, the voice of the herald was heard giving the order to the Eleven
to seize Theramenes. They at that instant entered with their satellites--at their head Satyrus,
the boldest and most shameless of the body--and Critias exclaimed, addressing the Eleven, "We
deliver over to you Theramenes yonder, who has been condemned according to the law. Do you
take him and lead him away to the proper place, and do there with him what remains to do."
As Critias uttered the words, Satyrus laid hold upon Theramenes to drag him from the altar,
and the attendants lent their aid. But he, as was natural, called upon gods and men to witness
what was happening. The senators the while kept silence, seeing the companions of Satyrus at
the bar, and the whole front of the senate house crowded with the foreign guards, nor did they
need to be told that there were daggers in reserve among those present.

And so Theramenes was dragged through the Agora, in vehement and loud tones proclaiming the
wrongs that he was suffering. One word, which is said to have fallen from his lips, I cite.
It is this: Satyrus, bade him "Be silent, or he would rue the day;" to which he made answer,
"And if I be silent, shall I not rue it?" Also, when they brought him the hemlock, and the
time was come to drink the fatal draught, they tell how he playfully jerked out the dregs from
the bottom of the cup, like one who plays "Cottabos," (22) with the words, "This to the lovely
Critias." These are but "apophthegms" (23) too trivial, it may be thought, to find a place
in history. Yet I must deem it an admirable trait in this man's character, if at such a moment,
when death confronted him, neither his wits forsook him, nor could the childlike sportiveness
vanish from his soul.

 (22) "A Sicilian game much in vogue at the drinking parties of young
    men at Athens. The simplest mode was when each threw the wine left
    in his cup so as to strike smartly in a metal basin, at the same
    time invoking his mistress's name; if all fell into the basin and
    the sound was clear, it was a sign he stood well with her."--
    Liddell and Scott, sub. v. For the origin of the game compare
    curiously enough the first line of the first Elegy of Critias
    himself, who was a poet and political philosopher, as well as a
    politician:--

"{Kottabos ek Sikeles esti khthonos, euprepes ergon on skopon es latagon toxa kathistametha.}"
Bergk. "Poetae Lyr. Graec." Pars II. xxx.

 (23) Or, "these are sayings too slight, perhaps, to deserve record;
    yet," etc. By an "apophthegm" was meant originally a terse
    (sententious) remark, but the word has somewhat altered in
    meaning.

IV

So Theramenes met his death; and, now that this obstacle was removed, the Thirty, feeling that
they had it in their power to play the tyrant without fear, issued an order forbidding all,
whose names were not on the list, to set foot within the city. Retirement in the country districts
was no protection, thither the prosecutor followed them, and thence dragged them, that their
farms and properties might fall to the possession of the Thirty and their friends. Even Piraeus
was not safe; of those who sought refuge there, many were driven forth in similar fashion,
until Megara and Thebes overflowed with the crowd of refugees.

Presently Thrasybulus, with about seventy followers, sallied out from Thebes, and made himself
master of the fortress of Phyle. (1) The weather was brilliant, and the Thirty marched out
of the city to repel the invader; with them were the Three Thousand and the Knights. When they
reached the place, some of the young men, in the foolhardiness of youth, made a dash at the
fortress, but without effect; all they got was wounds, and so retired. The intention of the
Thirty now was to blockade the place; by shutting off all the avenues of supplies, they thought
to force the garrison to capitulate. But this project was interrupted by a steady downfall
of snow that night and the following day. Baffled by this all-pervading enemy they beat a retreat
to the city, but not without the sacrifice of many of their camp-followers, who fell a prey
to the men in Phyle. The next anxiety of the government in Athens was to secure the farms and
country houses against the plunderings and forays to which they would be exposed, if there
were no armed force to protect them. With this object a protecting force was despatched to
the "boundary estates," (2) about two miles south of Phyle. This corps consisted of the Lacedaemonian
guards, or nearly all of them, and two divisions of horse. (3) They encamped in a wild and
broken district, and the round of their duties commenced.

 (1) "A strong fortress (the remains of which still exist) commanding
    the narrow pass across Mount Parnes, through which runs the direct
    road from Thebes to Athens, past Acharnae. The precipitous rock on
    which it stands can only be approached by a ridge on the eastern
    side. The height commands a magnificent view of the whole Athenian
    plain, of the city itself, of Mount Hymettus, and the Saronic
    Gulf,"--"Dict. of Geog., The demi of the Diacria and Mount
    Parnes."

 (2) Cf. Boeckh, "P. E. A." p. 63, Eng. ed.

 (3) Lit. tribes, each of the ten tribes furnishing about one hundred
    horse.

But by this time the small garrison above them had increased tenfold, until there were now
something like seven hundred men collected in Phyle; and with these Thrasybulus one night descended.
When he was not quite half a mile from the enemy's encampment he grounded arms, and a deep
silence was maintained until it drew towards day. In a little while the men opposite, one by
one, were getting to their legs or leaving the camp for necessary purposes, while a suppressed
din and murmur arose, caused by the grooms currying and combing their horses. This was the
moment for Thrasybulus and his men to snatch up their arms and make a dash at the enemy's position.
Some they felled on the spot; and routing the whole body, pursued them six or seven furlongs,
killing one hundred and twenty hoplites and more. Of the cavalry, Nicostratus, "the beautiful,"
as men called him, and two others besides were slain; they were caught while still in their
beds. Returning from the pursuit, the victors set up a trophy, got together all the arms they
had taken, besides baggage, and retired again to Phyle. A reinforcement of horse sent from
the city could not discover the vestige of a foe; but waited on the scene of battle until the
bodies of the slain had been picked up by their relatives, when they withdrew again to the city.

After this the Thirty, who had begun to realise the insecurity of their position, were anxious
to appropriate Eleusis, so that an asylum might be ready for them against the day of need.
With this view an order was issued to the Knights; and Critias, with the rest of the Thirty,
visited Eleusis. There they held a review of the Eleusians in the presence of the Knights;
(4) and, on the pretext of wishing to discover how many they were, and how large a garrison
they would further require, they ordered the townsfolk to enter their names. As each man did
so he had to retire by a postern leading to the sea. But on the sea-beach this side there were
lines of cavalry drawn up in waiting, and as each man appeared he was handcuffed by the satellites
of the Thirty. When all had so been seized and secured, they gave orders to Lysimachus, the
commander of the cavalry, to take them off to the city and deliver them over to the Eleven.
Next day they summoned the heavy armed who were on the list, and the rest of the Knights (5)
to the Odeum, and Critias rose and addressed them. He said: "Sirs, the constitution, the lines
of which we are laying down, is a work undertaken in your interests no less than ours; it is
incumbent on you therefore to participate in its dangers, even as you will partake of its honours.
We expect you therefore, in reference to these Eleusians here, who have been seized and secured,
to vote their condemnation, so that our hopes and fears may be identical." Then, pointing to
a particular spot, he said peremptorily, "You will please deposit your votes there within sight
of all." It must be understood that the Laconian guards were present at the time, and armed
to the teeth, and filling one-half of the Odeum. As to the proceedings themselves, they found
acceptance with those members of the State, besides the Thirty, who could be satisfied with
a simple policy of self-aggrandisement.

 (4) Or, "in the cavalry quarters," cf. {en tois ikhthusin} = in the
    fish market. Or, "at the review of the horse."

 (5) For the various Odeums at Athens vide Prof. Jebb, "Theophr."
    xviii. 235, 236. The one here named was near the fountain
    Callirhoe by the Ilissus.

But now Thrasybulus at the head of his followers, by this time about one thousand strong, descended
from Phyle and reached Piraeus in the night. The Thirty, on their side, informed of this new
move, were not slow to rally to the rescue, with the Laconian guards, supported by their own
cavalry and hoplites. And so they advanced, marching down along the broad carriage road which
leads into Piraeus. The men from Phyle seemed at first inclined to dispute their passage, but
as the wide circuit of the walls needed a defence beyond the reach of their still scanty numbers,
they fell back in a compact body upon Munychia. (6) Then the troops from the city poured into
the Agora of Hippodmus. (7) Here they formed in line, stretching along and filling the street
which leads to the temple of Artemis and the Bendideum. (8) This line must have been at least
fifty shields deep; and in this formation they at once began to march up. As to the men of
Phyle, they too blocked the street at the opposite end, and facing the foe. They presented
only a thin line, not more than ten deep, though behind these, certainly, were ranged a body
of targeteers and light-armed javelin men, who were again supported by an artillery of stone-throwers--a
tolerably numerous division drawn from the population of the port and district itself. While
his antagonists were still advancing, Thrasybulus gave the order to ground their heavy shields,
and having done so himself, whilst retaining the rest of his arms, he stood in the midst, and
thus addressed them: "Men and fellow-citizens, I wish to inform some, and to remind others
of you, that of the men you see advancing beneath us there, the right division are the very
men we routed and pursued only five days ago; while on the extreme left there you see the Thirty.
These are the men who have not spared to rob us of our city, though we did no wrong; who have
hounded us from our homes; who have set the seal of proscription on our dearest friends. But
to-day the wheel of fortune has revolved; that has come about which least of all they looked
for, which most of all we prayed for. Here we stand with our good swords in our hands, face
to face with our foes; and the gods themselves are with us, seeing that we were arrested in
the midst of our peaceful pursuits; at any moment, whilst we supped, or slept, or marketed,
sentence of banishment was passed upon us: we had done no wrong--nay, many of us were not even
resident in the country. To-day, therefore, I repeat, the gods do visibly fight upon our side;
the great gods, who raise a tempest even in the midst of calm for our benefit, and when we
lay to our hand to fight, enable our little company to set up the trophy of victory over the
multitude of our foes. On this day they have brought us hither to a place where the steep ascent
must needs hinder our foes from reaching with lance or arrow further than our foremost ranks;
but we with our volley of spears and arrows and stones cannot fail to reach them with terrible
effect. Had we been forced to meet them vanguard to vanguard, on an equal footing, who could
have been surprised? But as it is, all I say to you is, let fly your missiles with a will in
right brave style. No one can miss his mark when the road is full of them. To avoid our darts
they must be for ever ducking and skulking beneath their shields; but we will rain blows upon
them in their blindness; we will leap upon them and lay them low. But, O sirs! let me call
upon you so to bear yourselves that each shall be conscious to himself that victory was won
by him and him alone. Victory--which, God willing, shall this day restore to us the land of
our fathers, our homes, our freedom, and the rewards of civic life, our children, if children
we have, our darlings, and our wives! Thrice happy those among us who as conquerors shall look
upon this gladdest of all days. Nor less fortunate the man who falls to-day. Not all the wealth
in the world shall purchase him a monument so glorious. At the right instant I will strike
the keynote of the paean; then, with an invocation to the God of battle, (9) and in return
for the wanton insults they put upon us, let us with one accord wreak vengeance on yonder men."

 (6) The citadel quarter of Piraeus.

 (7) Named after the famous architect Hippodamus, who built the town.
    It was situated near where the two long walls joined the wall of
    Piraeus; a broad street led from it up to the citadel of Munychia.

 (8) I.e. the temple of Bendis (the Thracian Artemis). Cf. Plat. "Rep."
    327, 354; and Prof. Jowett, "Plato," vol. iii. pp. 193, 226.

 (9) Lit. "Enyalius," in Homer an epithet of Ares; at another date (cf.
    Aristoph. "Peace," 456) looked upon as a distinct divinity.

Having so spoken, he turned round, facing the foemen, and kept quiet, for the order passed
by the soothsayer enjoined on them, not to charge before one of their side was slain or wounded.
"As soon as that happens," said the seer, "we will lead you onwards, and the victory shall
be yours; but for myself, if I err not, death is waiting." And herein he spoke truly, for they
had barely resumed their arms when he himself as though he were driven by some fatal hand,
leapt out in front of the ranks, and so springing into the midst of the foe, was slain, and
lies now buried at the passage of the Cephisus. But the rest were victorious, and pursued the
routed enemy down to the level ground. There fell in this engagement, out of the number of
the Thirty, Critias himself and Hippomachus, and with them Charmides, (10) the son of Glaucon,
one of the ten archons in Piraeus, and of the rest about seventy men. The arms of the slain
were taken; but, as fellow-citizens, the conquerors forebore to despoil them of their coats.
This being done, they proceeded to give back the dead under cover of a truce, when the men,
on either side, in numbers stept forward and conversed with one another. Then Cleocritus (he
was the Herald of the Initiated, (11) a truly "sweet-voiced herald," if ever there was), caused
a deep silence to reign, and addressed their late combatants as follows: "Fellow-citizens--Why
do you drive us forth? why would you slay us? what evil have we wrought you at any time? or
is it a crime that we have shared with you in the most solemn rites and sacrifices, and in
festivals of the fairest: we have been companions in the chorus, the school, the army. We have
braved a thousand dangers with you by land and sea in behalf of our common safety, our common
liberty. By the gods of our fathers, by the gods of our mothers, by the hallowed names of kinship,
intermarriage, comradeship, those three bonds which knit the hearts of so many of us, bow in
reverence before God and man, and cease to sin against the land of our fathers: cease to obey
these most unhallowed Thirty, who for the sake of private gain have in eight months slain almost
more men than the Peloponnesians together in ten years of warfare. See, we have it in our power
to live as citizens in peace; it is only these men, who lay upon us this most foul burthen,
this hideous horror of fratricidal war, loathed of God and man. Ah! be well assured, for these
men slain by our hands this day, ye are not the sole mourners. There are among them some whose
deaths have wrung from us also many a bitter tear."

 (10) He was cousin to Critias, and uncle by the mother's side to
    Plato, who introduces him in the dialogue, which bears his name
    (and treats of Temperance), as a very young man at the beginning
    of the Peloponnesian War. We hear more of him also from Xenophon
    himself in the "Memorabilia," iii. 6. 7; and as one of the
    interlocutors in the "Symposium."

 (11) I.e. of the Eleusinian mysteries. He had not only a loud voice,
    but a big body. Cf. Aristoph. "Frogs," 1237.

So he spoke, but the officers and leaders of the defeated army who were left, unwilling that
their troops should listen to such topics at that moment, led them back to the city. But the
next day the Thirty, in deep down-heartedness and desolation, sat in the council chamber. The
Three Thousand, wherever their several divisions were posted, were everywhere a prey to discord.
Those who were implicated in deeds of violence, and whose fears could not sleep, protested
hotly that to yield to the party in Piraeus were preposterous. Those on the other hand who
had faith in their own innocence, argued in their own minds, and tried to convince their neighbours
that they could well dispense with most of their present evils. "Why yield obedience to these
Thirty?" they asked, "Why assign to them the privilege of destroying the State?" In the end
they voted a resolution to depose the government, and to elect another. This was a board of
ten, elected one from each tribe.

B.C. 403. As to the Thirty, they retired to Eleusis; but the Ten, assisted by the cavalry officers,
had enough to do to keep watch over the men in the city, whose anarchy and mutual distrust
were rampant. The Knights did not return to quarters at night, but slept out in the Odeum,
keeping their horses and shields close beside them; indeed the distrust was so great that from
evening onwards they patrolled the walls on foot with their shields, and at break of day mounted
their horses, at every moment fearing some sudden attack upon them by the men in Piraeus. These
latter were now so numerous, and of so mixed a company, that it was difficult to find arms
for all. Some had to be content with shields of wood, others of wicker-work, which they spent
their time in coating with whitening. Before ten days had elapsed guarantees were given, securing
full citizenship, with equality of taxation and tribute to all, even foreigners, who would
take part in the fighting. Thus they were presently able to take the field, with large detachments
both of heavy infantry and light-armed troops, besides a division of cavalry, about seventy
in number. Their system was to push forward foraging parties in quest of wood and fruits, returning
at nightfall to Piraeus. Of the city party no one ventured to take the field under arms; only,
from time to time, the cavalry would capture stray pillagers from Piraeus or inflict some damage
on the main body of their opponents. Once they fell in with a party belonging to the deme Aexone,
(12) marching to their own farms in search of provisions. These, in spite of many prayers for
mercy and the strong disapprobation of many of the knights, were ruthlessly slaughtered by
Lysimachus, the general of cavalry. The men of Piraeus retaliated by putting to death a horseman,
named Callistratus, of the tribe Leontis, whom they captured in the country. Indeed their courage
ran so high at present that they even meditated an assault upon the city walls. And here perhaps
the reader will pardon the record of a somewhat ingenious device on the part of the city engineer,
who, aware of the enemy's intention to advance his batteries along the racecourse, which slopes
from the Lyceum, had all the carts and waggons which were to be found laden with blocks of
stone, each one a cartload in itself, and so sent them to deposit their freights "pele-mele"
on the course in question. The annoyance created by these separate blocks of stone was enormous,
and quite out of proportion to the simplicity of the contrivance.

    "Athen." vii. 325.

But it was to Lacedaemon that men's eyes now turned. The Thirty despatched one set of ambassadors
from Eleusis, while another set representing the government of the city, that is to say the
men on the list, was despatched to summon the Lacedaemonians to their aid, on the plea that
the people had revolted from Sparta. At Sparta, Lysander, taking into account the possibility
of speedily reducing the party in Piraeus by blockading them by land and sea, and so cutting
them off from all supplies, supported the application, and negotiated the loan of one hundred
talents (13) to his clients, backed by the appointment of himself as harmost on land, and of
his brother, Libys, as admiral of the fleet. And so proceeding to the scene of action at Eleusis,
he got together a large body of Peloponnesian hoplites, whilst his brother, the admiral, kept
watch and ward by sea to prevent the importation of supplies into Piraeus by water. Thus the
men in Piraeus were soon again reduced to their former helplessness, while the ardour of the
city folk rose to a proportionally high pitch under the auspices of Lysander.

 (13) 24,375 pounds, reckoning one tal. = 243 pounds 15 shillings.

Things were progressing after this sort when King Pausanias intervened. Touched by a certain
envy of Lysander--(who seemed, by a final stroke of achievement, about to reach the pinnacle
of popularity, with Athens laid like a pocket dependency at his feet)--the king persuaded three
of the ephors to support him, and forthwith called out the ban. With him marched contingents
of all the allied States, except the Boeotians and Corinthians. These maintained, that to undertake
such an expedition against the Athenians, in whose conduct they saw nothing contrary to the
treaty, was inconsistent with their oaths. But if that was the language held by them, the secret
of their behaviour lay deeper; they seemed to be aware of a desire on the part of the Lacedaemonians
to annex the soil of the Athenians and to reduce the state to vassalage. Pausanias encamped
on the Halipedon, (14) as the sandy flat is called, with his right wing resting on Piraeus,
and Lysander and his mercenaries forming the left. His first act was to send an embassage to
the party in Piraeus, calling upon them to retire peacably to their homes; when they refused
to obey, he made, as far as mere noise went, the semblance of an attack, with sufficient show
of fight to prevent his kindly disposition being too apparent. But gaining nothing by the feint,
he was forced to retire. Next day he took two Laconian regiments, with three tribes of Athenian
horse, and crossed over to the Mute (15) Harbour, examining the lie of the ground to discover
how and where it would be easiest to draw lines of circumvallation round Piraeus. As he turned
his back to retire, a party of the enemy sallied out and caused him annoyance. Nettled at the
liberty, he ordered the cavalry to charge at the gallop, supported by the ten-year-service
(16) infantry, whilst he himself, with the rest of the troops, followed close, holding quietly
back in reserve. They cut down about thirty of the enemy's light troops and pursued the rest
hotly to the theatre in Piraeus. Here, as chance would have it, the whole light and heavy infantry
of the Piraeus men were getting under arms; and in an instant their light troops rushed out
and dashed at the assailants; thick and fast flew missiles of all sorts--javelins, arrows and
sling stones. The Lacedaemonians finding the number of their wounded increasing every minute,
and sorely called, slowly fell back step by step, eyeing their opponents. These meanwhile resolutely
pressed on. Here fell Chaeron and Thibrachus, both polemarchs, here also Lacrates, an Olympic
victor, and other Lacedaemonians, all of whom now lie entombed before the city gates in the
Ceramicus. (17)

    Piraeus Phalerum and the city.

Watching how matters went, Thrasybulus began his advance with the whole of his heavy infantry
to support his light troops and quickly fell into line eight deep, acting as a screen to the
rest of his troops. Pausanias, on his side, had retired, sorely pressed, about half a mile
towards a bit of rising ground, where he sent orders to the Lacedaemonians and the other allied
troops to bring up reinforcements. Here, on this slope, he reformed his troops, giving his
phalanx the full depth, and advanced against the Athenians, who did not hesitate to receive
him at close quarters, but presently had to give way; one portion being forced into the mud
and clay at Halae, (18) while the others wavered and broke their line; one hundred and fifty
of them were left dead on the field, whereupon Pausanias set up a trophy and retired. Not even
so, were his feelings embittered against his adversary. On the contrary he sent secretly and
instructed the men of Piraeus, what sort of terms they should propose to himself and the ephors
in attendance. To this advice they listened. He also fostered a division in the party within
the city. A deputation, acting on his orders, sought an audience of him and the ephors. It
had all the appearance of a mass meeting. In approaching the Spartan authorities, they had
no desire or occasion, they stated, to look upon the men of Piraeus as enemies, they would
prefer a general reconciliation and the friendship of both sides with Lacedaemon. The propositions
were favourably received, and by no less a person than Nauclidas. He was present as ephor,
in accordance with the custom which obliges two members of that board to serve on all military
expeditions with the king, and with his colleague shared the political views represented by
Pausanias, rather than those of Lysander and his party. Thus the authorities were quite ready
to despatch to Lacedaemon the representatives of Piraeus, carrying their terms of truce with
the Lacedaemonians, as also two private individuals belonging to the city party, whose names
were Cephisophon and Meletus. This double deputation, however, had no sooner set out to Lacedaemon
than the "de facto" government of the city followed suit, by sending a third set of representatives
to state on their behalf: that they were prepared to deliver up themselves and the fortifications
in their possession to the Lacedaemonians, to do with them what they liked. "Are the men of
Piraeus," they asked, "prepared to surrender Piraeus and Munychia in the same way? If they
are sincere in their profession of friendship to Lacedaemon, they ought to do so." The ephors
and the members of assembly at Sparta (19) gave audience to these several parties, and sent
out fifteen commissioners to Athens empowered, in conjunction with Pausanias, to discover the
best settlement possible. The terms (20) arrived at were that a general peace between the rival
parties should be established, liberty to return to their own homes being granted to all, with
the exception of the Thirty, the Eleven, and the Ten who had been governors in Piraeus; but
a proviso was added, enabling any of the city party who feared to remain at Athens to find
a home in Eleusis.

And now that everything was happily concluded, Pausanias disbanded his army, and the men from
Piraeus marched up under arms into the acropolis and offered sacrifice to Athena. When they
were come down, the generals called a meeting of the Ecclesia, (21) and Thrasybulus made a
speech in which, addressing the city party, he said: "Men of the city! I have one piece of
advice I would tender to you; it is that you should learn to know yourselves, and towards the
attainment of that self-knowledge I would have you make a careful computation of your good
qualities and satisfy yourselves on the strength of which of these it is that you claim to
rule over us. Is it that you are more just than ourselves? Yet the people, who are poorer--have
never wronged you for the purposes of plunder; but you, whose wealth would outweight the whole
of ours, have wrought many a shameful deed for the sake of gain. If, then, you have no monopoly
of justice, can it be on the score of courage that you are warranted to hold your heads so
high? If so, what fairer test of courage will you propose than the arbitrament of war--the
war just ended? Or do you claim superiority of intelligence?--you, who with all your wealth
of arms and walls, money and Peloponnesian allies, have been paralysed by men who had none
of these things to aid them! Or is it on these Laconian friends of yours that you pride yourselves?
What! when these same friends have dealt by you as men deal by vicious dogs. You know how that
is. They put a heavy collar round the neck of the brutes and hand them over muzzled to their
masters. So too have the Lacedaemonians handed you over to the people, this very people whom
you have injured; and now they have turned their backs and are gone. But" (turning to the mass)
"do not misconceive me. It is not for me, sirs, coldly to beg of you, in no respect to violate
your solemn undertakings. I go further; I beg you, to crown your list of exploits by one final
display of virtue. Show the world that you can be faithful to your oaths, and flawless in your
conduct." By these and other kindred arguments he impressed upon them that there was no need
for anarchy or disorder, seeing that there were the ancient laws ready for use. And so he broke
up (22) the assembly.

 (21) I.e. the Public Assembly, see above; and reading with Sauppe
    after Cobet {ekklesian epoiesan}, which words are supposed to have
    dropt out of the MSS. Or, keeping to the MSS., translate "When the
    generals were come down, Thrasybulus," etc. See next note.

 (22) The Greek words are {antestese ten ekklesian} (an odd phrase for
    the more technical {eluse} or {dieluse ten ekklesian}). Or,
    accepting the MSS. reading above (see last note), translate "he
    set up (i.e. restored) the Assembly." So Mr. J. G. Philpotts, Mr.
    Herbert Hailstone, and others.

At this auspicious moment, then, they reappointed the several magistrates; the constitution
began to work afresh, and civic life was recommenced. At a subsequent period, on receiving
information that the party at Eleusis were collecting a body of mercenaries, they marched out
with their whole force against them, and put to death their generals, who came out to parley.
These removed, they introduced to the others their friends and connections, and so persuaded
them to come to terms and be reconciled. The oath they bound themselves by consisted of a simple
asseveration: "We will remember past offences no more;" and to this day (23) the two parties
live amicably together as good citizens, and the democracy is steadfast to its oaths.

 (23) It would be interesting to know the date at which the author
    penned these words. Was this portion of the "Hellenica" written
    before the expedition of Cyrus? i.e. in the interval between the
    formal restoration of the Democracy, September B.C. 403, and March
    B.C. 401. The remaining books of the "Hellenica" were clearly
    written after that expedition, since reference is made to it quite
    early in Bk. III. i. 2. Practically, then, the first volume of
    Xenophon's "History of Hellenic Affairs" ends here. This history
    is resumed in Bk. III. i. 3. after the Cyreian expedition  (of
    which episode we have a detailed account in the "Anabasis" from
    March B.C. 401 down to March B.C. 399, when the remnant of the Ten
    Thousand was handed over to the Spartan general Thibron in Asia).
    Some incidents belonging to B.C. 402 are referred to in the
    opening paragraphs of "Hellenica," III. i. 1, 2, but only as an
    introduction to the new matter; and with regard to the historian
    himself, it is clear that "a change has come o'er the spirit of
    his dream." This change of view is marked by a change of style in
    writing. I have thought it legitimate, under the circumstances, to
    follow the chronological order of events, and instead of
    continuing the "Hellenica," at this point to insert the
    "Anabasis." My next volume will contain the remaining books of the
    "Hellenica" and the rest of Xenophon's "historical" writings.

BOOK III

I

B.C. 403-402. Thus the civil strife at Athens had an end. At a subsequent date Cyrus sent messengers
to Lacedaemon, claiming requital in kind for the service which he had lately rendered in the
war with Athens. (1) The demand seemed to the ephorate just and reasonable. Accordingly they
ordered Samius, (2) who was admiral at the time, to put himself at the disposition of Cyrus
for any service which he might require. Samius himself needed no persuasion to carry out the
wishes of Cyrus. With his own fleet, accompanied by that of Cyrus, he sailed round to Cilicia,
and so made it impossible for Syennesis, the ruler of that province, to oppose Cyrus by land
in his advance against the king his brother.

 (1) Lit. "what Cyrus himself had been to the Lacedaemonians let the
    Lacedaemonians in their turn be to Cyrus."

 (2) Samius (Diod. Sic. xiv. 19). But see "Anab." I. iv. 2, where
    Pythagoras is named as admiral. Possibly the one officer succeeded
    the other.

B.C. 401. The particulars of the expedition are to be found in the pages of the Syracusan Themistogenes,
(3) who describes the mustering of the armament, and the advance of Cyrus at the head of his
troops; and then the battle, and death of Cyrus himself, and the consequent retreat of the
Hellenes while effecting their escape to the sea. (4)

 (3) Lit. "as to how then Cyrus collected an army and with it went up
    against his brother, and how the battle was fought and how he
    died, and how in the sequel the Hellenes escaped to the sea (all
    this), is written by (or 'for,' or 'in honour of') Themistogenes
    the Syracusan." My impression is that Xenophon's "Anabasis," or a
    portion of the work so named, was edited originally by
    Themistogenes. See "Philol. Museum," vol. i. p. 489; L. Dindorf,
    {Xen. Ell.}, Ox. MDCCCLIII., node ad loc. {Themistogenei}. Cf.
    Diod. Sic. xiv. 19-31, 37, after Ephorus and Theopompus probably.

 (4) At Trapezus, March 10, B.C. 400.

B.C. 400. It was in recognition of the service which he had rendered in this affair, that Tissaphernes
was despatched to Lower Asia by the king his master. He came as satrap, not only of his own
provinces, but of those which had belonged to Cyrus; and he at once demanded the absolute submission
of the Ionic cities, without exception, to his authority. These communities, partly from a
desire to maintain their freedom, and partly from fear of Tissaphernes himself, whom they had
rejected in favour of Cyrus during the lifetime of that prince, were loth to admit the satrap
within their gates. They thought it better to send an embassy to the Lacedaemonians, calling
upon them as representatives and leaders (5) of the Hellenic world to look to the interests
of their petitioners, who were Hellenes also, albeit they lived in Asia, and not to suffer
their country to be ravaged and themselves enslaved.

 (5) {Prostatai}, "patrons and protectors."

In answer to this appeal, the Lacedaemonians sent out Thibron (6) as governor, providing him
with a body of troops, consisting of one thousand neodamodes (7) (i.e. enfranchised helots)
and four thousand Peloponnesians. In addition to these, Thibron himself applied to the Athenians
for a detachment of three hundred horse, for whose service-money he would hold himself responsible.
The Athenians in answer sent him some of the knights who had served under the Thirty, (8) thinking
that the people of Athens would be well rid of them if they went abroad and perished there.

 (6) "As harmost." See "Anab." ad fin.

 (7) See "Hell." I. iii. 15; Thuc. vii. 58.

 (8) See "Hell." II. iv. 2.

B.C. 400-399. On their arrival in Asia, Thibron further collected contingents from the Hellenic
cities on the continent; for at this time the word of a Lacedaemonian was law. He had only
to command, and every city must needs obey. (9) But although he had this armament, Thibron,
when he saw the cavalry, had no mind to descend into the plain. If he succeeded in protecting
from pillage the particular district in which he chanced to be, he was quite content. It was
only when the troops (10) who had taken part in the expedition of Cyrus had joined him on their
safe return, that he assumed a bolder attitude. He was now ready to confront Tissaphernes,
army against army, on the level ground, and won over a number of cities. Pergamum came in of
her own accord. So did Teuthrania and Halisarna. These were under the government of Eurysthenes
and Procles, (11) the descendants of Demaratus the Lacedaemonian, who in days of old had received
this territory as a gift from the Persian monarch in return for his share in the campaign against
Hellas. Gorgion and Gongylus, two brothers, also gave in their adhesion; they were lords, the
one of Gambreum and Palae-Gambreum, the other of Myrina and Gryneum, four cities which, like
those above named, had originally been gifts from the king to an earlier Gongylus--the sole
Eretrian who "joined the Mede," and in consequence was banished. Other cities which were too
weak to resist, Thibron took by force of arms. In the case of one he was not so successful.
This was the Egyptian (12) Larisa, as it is called, which refused to capitulate, and was forthwith
invested and subjected to a regular siege. When all other attempts to take it failed, he set
about digging a tank or reservoir, and in connection with the tank an underground channel,
by means of which he proposed to draw off the water supply of the inhabitants. In this he was
baffled by frequent sallies of the besieged, and a continual discharge of timber and stones
into the cutting. He retaliated by the construction of a wooden tortoise which he erected over
the tank; but once more the tortoise was burnt to a cinder in a successful night attack on
the part of the men of Larisa. These ineffectual efforts induced the ephors to send a despatch
bidding Thibron give up Larisa and march upon Caria.

He had already reached Ephesus, and was on the point of marching into Caria, when Dercylidas
arrived to take command of his army. The new general was a man whose genius for invention had
won him the nickname of Sisyphus. Thus it was that Thibron returned home, where on his arrival
he was fined and banished, the allies accusing him of allowing his troops to plunder their friends.

Dercylidas was not slow to perceive and turn to account the jealousy which subsisted between
Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus. Coming to terms with the former, he marched into the territory
of the latter, preferring, as he said, to be at war with one of the pair at a time, rather
than the two together. His hostility, indeed, to Pharnabazus was an old story, dating back
to a period during the naval command (13) of Lysander, when he was himself governor in Abydos;
where, thanks to Pharnabazus, he had got into trouble with his superior officer, and had been
made to stand "with his shield on his arm"--a stigma on his honour which no true Lacedaemonian
would forgive, since this is the punishment of insubordination. (14) For this reason, doubtless,
Dercylidas had the greater satisfaction in marching against Pharnabazus. From the moment he
assumed command there was a marked difference for the better between his methods and those
of his predecessor. Thus he contrived to conduct his troops into that portion of the Aeolid
which belonged to Pharnabazus, through the heart of friendly territory without injury to the
allies.

 (13) Technically "navarchy," in B.C. 408-407. "Hell." I. v. 1.

 (14) See Plut. "Aristid." 23 (Clough, ii. p. 309).

This district of Aeolis belonged to Pharnabazus, (15) but had been held as a satrapy under
him by a Dardanian named Zenis whilst he was alive; but when Zenis fell sick and died, Pharnabazus
made preparation to give the satrapy to another. Then Mania the wife of Zenis, herself also
a Dardanian, fitted out an expedition, and taking with her gifts wherewith to make a present
to Pharnabazus himself, and to gratify his concubines and those whose power was greatest with
Pharnabazus, set forth on her journey. When she had obtained audience with him she spoke as
follows: "O Pharnabazus, thou knowest that thy servant my husband was in all respects friendly
to thee; moreover, he paid my lord the tributes which were thy due, so that thou didst praise
and honour him. Now therefore, if I do thee service as faithfully as my husband, why needest
thou to appoint another satrap?--nay but, if in any matter I please thee not, is it not in
thy power to take from me the government on that day, and to give it to another?" When he had
heard her words, Pharnabazus decided that the woman ought to be satrap. She, as soon as she
was mistress of the territory, never ceased to render the tribute in due season, even as her
husband before her had done. Moreover, whenever she came to the court of Pharnabazus she brought
him gifts continually, and whenever Pharnabazus went down to visit her provinces she welcomed
him with all fair and courteous entertainment beyond what his other viceroys were wont to do.
The cities also which had been left to her by her husband, she guarded safely for him; while
of those cities that owed her no allegiance, she acquired, on the seaboard, Larisa and Hamaxitus
and Colonae--attacking their walls by aid of Hellenic mercenaries, whilst she herself sat in
her carriage and watched the spectacle. Nor was she sparing of her gifts to those who won her
admiration; and thus she furnished herself with a mercenary force of exceptional splendour.
She also went with Pharnabazus on his campaigns, even when, on pretext of some injury done
to the king's territory, Mysians or Pisidians were the object of attack. In requital, Pharnabazus
paid her magnificent honour, and at times invited her to assist him with her counsel. (16)

 (15) I.e. as suzerain.

 (16) Grote, "H. G." ix. 292; cf. Herod. viii. 69.

Now when Mania was more than forty years old, the husband of her own daughter, Meidias--flustered
by the suggestions of certain people who said that it was monstrous a woman should rule and
he remain a private person (17)--found his way into her presence, as the story goes, and strangled
her. For Mania, albeit she carefully guarded herself against all ordinary comers, as behoved
her in the exercise of her "tyranny," trusted in Meidias, and, as a woman might her own son-in-law,
was ready to greet him at all times with open arms. He also murdered her son, a youth of marvellous
beauty, who was about seventeen years of age. He next seized upon the strong cities of Scepsis
and Gergithes, in which lay for the most part the property and wealth of Mania. As for the
other cities of the satrapy, they would not receive the usurper, their garrisons keeping them
safely for Pharnabazus. Thereupon Meidias sent gifts to Pharnabazus, and claimed to hold the
district even as Mania had held it; to whom the other answered, "Keep your gifts and guard
them safely until that day when I shall come in person and take both you and them together";
adding, "What care I to live longer if I avenge not myself for the murder of Mania!"

 (17) Or, "his brains whimsied with insinuations."

Just at the critical moment Dercylidas arrived, and in a single day received the adhesion of
the three seaboard cities Larisa, Hamaxitus, and Colonae--which threw open their gates to him.
Then he sent messengers to the cities of the Aeolid also, offering them freedom if they would
receive him within their walls and become allies. Accordingly the men of Neandria and Ilium
and Cocylium lent willing ears; for since the death of Mania their Hellenic garrisons had been
treated but ill. But the commander of the garrison in Cebrene, a place of some strength, bethinking
him that if he should succeed in guarding that city for Pharnabazus, he would receive honour
at his hands, refused to admit Dercylidas. Whereupon the latter, in a rage, prepared to take
the place by force; but when he came to sacrifice, on the first day the victims would not yield
good omens; on the second, and again upon the third day, it was the same story. Thus for as
many as four days he persevered in sacrificing, cherishing wrath the while--for he was in haste
to become master of the whole Aeolid before Pharnabazus came to the succour of the district.

Meanwhile a certain Sicyonian captain, Athenadas by name, said to himself: "Dercylidas does
but trifle to waste his time here, whilst I with my own hand can draw off their water from
the men of Cybrene"; wherewith he ran forward with his division and essayed to choke up the
spring which supplied the city. But the garrison sallied out and covered the Sicyonian himself
with wounds, besides killing two of his men. Indeed, they plied their swords and missiles with
such good effect that the whole company was forced to beat a retreat. Dercylidas was not a
little annoyed, thinking that now the spirit of the besiegers would certainly die away; but
whilst he was in this mood, behold! there arrived from the beleaguered fortress emissaries
of the Hellenes, who stated that the action taken by the commandant was not to their taste;
for themselves, they would far rather be joined in bonds of fellowship with Hellenes than with
barbarians. While the matter was still under discussion there came a messenger also from the
commandant, to say that whatever the former deputation had proposed he, on his side, was ready
to endorse. Accordingly Dercylidas, who, it so happened, had at length obtained favourable
omens on that day, marched his force without more ado up to the gates of the city, which were
flung open by those within; and so he entered. (18) Here, then, he was content to appoint a
garrison, and without further stay advanced upon Scepsis and Gergithes.

 (18) Grote ("H. G." ix. 294) says: "The reader will remark how
    Xenophon shapes the narrative in such a manner as to inculcate the
    pious duty in a general of obeying the warnings furnished by the
    sacrifice--either for action or for inaction.... Such an
    inference is never (I believe) to be found suggested in
    Thucydides." See Brietenbach, "Xen. Hell." I et II, praef. in
    alteram ed. p. xvii.

And now Meidias, partly expecting the hostile advance of Pharnabazus, and partly mistrusting
the citizens--for to such a pass things had come--sent to Dercylidas, proposing to meet him
in conference provided he might take security of hostages. In answer to this suggestion the
other sent him one man from each of the cities of the allies, and bade him take his pick of
these, whichsoever and how many soever he chose, as hostages for his own security. Meidias
selected ten, and so went out. In conversation with Dercylidas, he asked him on what terms
he would accept his alliance. The other answered: "The terms are that you grant the citizens
freedom and self-government." The words were scarcely out of his mouth before he began marching
upon Scepsis. Whereupon Meidias, perceiving it was vain to hinder him in the teeth of the citizens,
suffered him to enter. That done, Dercylidas offered sacrifice to Athena in the citadel of
the Scepsians, turned out the bodyguards of Meidias, and handed over the city to the citizens.
And so, having admonished them to regulate their civic life as Hellenes and free men ought,
he left the place and continued his advance against Gergithes. On this last march he was escorted
by many of the Scepsians themselves; such was the honour they paid him and so great their satisfaction
at his exploits. Meidias also followed close at his side, petitioning that he would hand over
the city of Gergithians to himself. To whom Dercylidas only made reply, that he should not
fail to obtain any of his just rights. And whilst the words were yet upon his lips, he was
drawing close to the gates, with Meidias at his side. Behind him followed the troops, marching
two and two in peaceful fashion. The defenders of Gergithes from their towers--which were extraordinarily
high--espied Meidias in company of the Spartan, and abstained from shooting. And Dercylidas
said: "Bid them open the gates, Meidias, when you shall lead the way, and I will enter the
temple along with you and do sacrifice to Athena." And Meidias, though he shrank from opening
the gates, yet in terror of finding himself on a sudden seized, reluctantly gave the order
to open the gates. As soon as he was entered in, the Spartan, still taking Meidias with him,
marched up to the citadel and there ordered the main body of his soldiers to take up their
position round the walls, whilst he with those about him did sacrifice to Athena. When the
sacrifice was ended he ordered Meidias's bodyguard to pile arms (19) in the van of his troops.
Here for the future they would serve as mercenaries, since Meidias their former master stood
no longer in need of their protection. The latter, being at his wits' end what to do, exclaimed:
"Look you, I will now leave you; I go to make preparation for my guest." But the other replied:
"Heaven forbid! Ill were it that I who have offered sacrifice should be treated as a guest
by you. I rather should be the entertainer and you the guest. Pray stay with us, and while
the supper is preparing, you and I can consider our obligations, and perform them."

 (19) I.e. take up a position, or "to order arms," whilst he addressed
    them; not probably "to ground arms," as if likely to be mutinous.

When they were seated Dercylidas put certain questions: "Tell me, Meidias, did your father
leave you heir to his estates?" "Certainly he did," answered the other. "And how many dwelling-houses
have you? what landed estates? how much pasturage?" The other began running off an inventory,
whilst some of the Scepsians who were present kept interposing, "He is lying to you, Dercylidas."
"Nay, you take too minute a view of matters," replied the Spartan. When the inventory of the
paternal property was completed, he proceeded: "Tell me, Meidias, to whom did Mania belong?"
A chorus of voices rejoined, "To Pharnabazus." "Then must her property have belonged to Pharnabazus
too." "Certainly," they answered. "Then it must now be ours," he remarked, "by right of conquest,
since Pharnabazus is at war with us. Will some one of you escort me to the place where the
property of Mania and Pharnabazus lies?" So the rest led the way to the dwelling-place of Mania
which Meidias had taken from her, and Meidias followed too. When he was entered, Dercylidas
summoned the stewards, and bidding his attendants seize them, gave them to understand that,
if detected stealing anything which belonged to Mania, they would lose their heads on the spot.
The stewards proceeded to point out the treasures, and he, when he had looked through the whole
store, bolted and barred the doors, affixing his seal, and setting a watch. As he went out
he found at the doors certain of the generals (20) and captains, and said to them: "Here, sirs,
we have pay ready made for the army--a year's pay nearly for eight thousand men--and if we
can win anything besides, there will be so much the more." This he said, knowing that those
who heard it would be all the more amenable to discipline, and would yield him a more flattering
obedience. Then Meidias asked, "And where am I to live, Dercylidas?" "Where you have the very
best right to live," replied the other, "in your native town of Scepsis, and in your father's
house."

 (20) Lit. "of the taxiarchs and lochagoi."

II

Such were the exploits of Dercylidas: nine cities taken in eight days. Two considerations now
began to occupy his mind: how was he to avoid falling into the fatal error of Thibron and becoming
a burthen to his allies, whilst wintering in a friendly country? how, again, was he to prevent
Pharnabazus from overriding the Hellenic states in pure contempt with his cavalry? Accordingly
he sent to Pharnabazus and put it to him point-blank: Which will you have, peace or war? Whereupon
Pharnabazus, who could not but perceive that the whole Aeolid had now been converted practically
into a fortified base of operations, which threatened his own homestead of Phrygia, chose peace.

B.C. 399-398. This being so, Dercylidas advanced into Bithynian Thrace, and there spent the
winter; nor did Pharnabazus exhibit a shadow of annoyance, since the Bithynians were perpetually
at war with himself. For the most part, Dercylidas continued to harry (1) Bithynia in perfect
security, and found provisions without stint. Presently he was joined from the other side of
the straits by some Odrysian allies sent by Seuthes; (2) they numbered two hundred horse and
three hundred peltasts. These fellows pitched upon a site a little more than a couple of miles
(3) from the Hellenic force, where they entrenched themselves; then having got from Dercylidas
some heavy infantry soldiers to act as guards of their encampment, they devoted themselves
to plundering, and succeeded in capturing an ample store of slaves and other wealth. Presently
their camp was full of prisoners, when one morning the Bithynians, having ascertained the actual
numbers of the marauding parties as well as of the Hellenes left as guards behind, collected
in large masses of light troops and cavalry, and attacked the garrison, who were not more than
two hundred strong. As soon as they came close enough, they began discharging spears and other
missiles on the little body, who on their side continued to be wounded and shot down, but were
quite unable to retaliate, cooped up as they were within a palisading barely six feet high,
until in desperation they tore down their defences with their own hands, and dashed at the
enemy. These had nothing to do but to draw back from the point of egress, and being light troops
easily escaped beyond the grasp of heavy-armed men, while ever and again, from one point of
vantage or another, they poured their shower of javelins, and at every sally laid many a brave
man low, till at length, like sheep penned in a fold, the defenders were shot down almost to
a man. A remnant, it is true, did escape, consisting of some fifteen who, seeing the turn affairs
were taking, had already made off in the middle of the fighting. Slipping through their assailants'
fingers, (4) to the small concern of the Bithynians, they reached the main Hellenic camp in
safety. The Bithynians, satisfied with their achievement, part of which consisted in cutting
down the tent guards of the Odrysian Thracians and recovering all their prisoners, made off
without delay; so that by the time the Hellenes got wind of the affair and rallied to the rescue,
they found nothing left in the camp save only the stripped corpses of the slain. When the Odrysians
themselves returned, they fell to burying their own dead, quaffing copious draughts of wine
in their honour and holding horse-races; but for the future they deemed it advisable to camp
along with the Hellenes. Thus they harried and burned Bithynia the winter through.

    and chattels to make away with."

 (3) Lit. "twenty stades."

 (4) Or, "slipping through the enemy's fingers, who took no heed of
    them, they," etc.

B.C. 398. With the commencement of spring Dercylidas turned his back upon the Bithynians and
came to Lampsacus. Whilst at this place envoys reached him from the home authorities. These
were Aracus, Naubates, and Antisthenes. They were sent to inquire generally into the condition
of affairs in Asia, and to inform Dercylidas of the extension of his office for another year.
They had been further commissioned by the ephors to summon a meeting of the soldiers and inform
them that the ephors held them to blame for their former doings, though for their present avoidance
of evil conduct they must needs praise them; and for the future they must understand that while
no repetition of misdoing would be tolerated, all just and upright dealing by the allies would
receive its meed of praise. The soldiers were therefore summoned, and the envoys delivered
their message, to which the leader of the Cyreians answered: "Nay, men of Lacedaemon, listen;
we are the same to-day as we were last year; only our general of to-day is different from our
general in the past. If to-day we have avoided our offence of yesterday, the cause is not far
to seek; you may discover it for yourselves."

Aracus and the other envoys shared the hospitality of Dercylidas's tent, and one of the party
chanced to mention how they had left an embassy from the men of Chersonese in Lacedaemon. According
to their statement, he added, it was impossible for them to till their land nowadays, so perpetually
were they robbed and plundered by the Thracians; whereas the peninsula needed only to be walled
across from sea to sea, and there would be abundance of good land to cultivate--enough for
themselves and as many others from Lacedaemon as cared to come. "So that it would not surprise
us," continued the envoys, "if a Lacedaemonian were actually sent out from Sparta with a force
to carry out the project." Dercylidas kept his ears open but his counsel close, and so sent
forward the commissioners to Ephesus. (5) It pleased him to picture their progress through
the Hellenic cities, and the spectacle of peace and prosperity which would everywhere greet
their eyes. When he knew that his stay was to be prolonged, he sent again to Pharnabazus and
offered him once more as an alternative either the prolongation of the winter truce or war.
And once again Pharnabazus chose truce. It was thus that Dercylidas was able to leave the cities
in the neighbourhood of the satrap (6) in peace and friendship. Crossing the Hellespont himself
he brought his army into Europe, and marching through Thrace, which was also friendly, was
entertained by Seuthes, (7) and so reached the Chersonese.

 (5) See Grote, "H. G." ix. 301.

 (6) Or, reading after Cobet, {tas peri ekeina poleis}--"the cities of
    that neighbourhood."

 (7) See "Anab." VII. vii. 51.

This district, he soon discovered, not only contained something like a dozen cities, (8) but
was singularly fertile. The soil was of the best, but ruined by the ravages of the Thracians,
precisely as he had been told. Accordingly, having measured and found the breadth of the isthmus
barely four miles, (9) he no longer hesitated. Having offered sacrifice, he commenced his line
of wall, distributing the area to the soldiers in detachments, and promising to award them
prizes for their industry--a first prize for the section first completed, and the rest as each
detachment of workers might deserve. By this means the whole wall begun in spring was finished
before autumn. Within these lines he established eleven cities, with numerous harbours, abundance
of good arable land, and plenty of land under plantation, besides magnificent grazing grounds
for sheep and cattle of every kind.

 (8) Lit. "eleven or twelve cities." For the natural productivity, see
    "Anab." V. vi. 25.

 (9) Lit. "thirty-seven stades." Mod. Gallipoli. See Herod. vi. 36;
    Plut. "Pericl." xix.

Having finished the work, he crossed back again into Asia, and on a tour of inspection, found
the cities for the most part in a thriving condition; but when he came to Atarneus he discovered
that certain exiles from Chios had got possession of the stronghold, which served them as a
convenient base for pillaging and plundering Ionia; and this, in fact, was their means of livelihood.
Being further informed of the large supplies of grain which they had inside, he proceeded to
draw entrenchments around the place with a view to a regular investment, and by this means
he reduced it in eight months. Then having appointed Draco of Pellene (10) commandant, he stocked
the fortress with an abundance of provisions of all sorts, to serve him as a halting-place
when he chanced to pass that way, and so withdrew to Ephesus, which is three days' journey
from Sardis.

 (10) Cf. Isocr. "Panegyr." 70; Jebb. "Att. Or." ii. p. 161. Of Pellene
    (or Pellana) in Laconia, not Pellene in Achaia? though that is the
    opinion of Grote and Thirlwall.

B.C. 397. Up to this date peace had been maintained between Tissaphernes and Dercylidas, as
also between the Hellenes and the barbarians in those parts. But the time came when an embassy
arrived at Lacedaemon from the Ionic cities, protesting that Tissaphernes might, if he chose,
leave the Hellenic cities independent. "Our idea," they added, "is, that if Caria, the home
of Tissaphernes, felt the pinch of war, the satrap would very soon agree to grant us independence."
The ephors, on hearing this, sent a despatch to Dercylidas, and bade him cross the frontier
with his army into Caria, whilst Pharax the admiral coasted round with the fleet. These orders
were carried out. Meanwhile a visitor had reached Tissaphernes. This was not less a person
than Pharnabazus. His coming was partly owing to the fact that Tissaphernes had been appointed
general-in-chief, and party in order to testify his readiness to make common cause with his
brother satrap in fighting and expelling the Hellenes from the king's territory; for if his
heart was stirred by jealousy on account of the generalship bestowed upon his rival, he was
not the less aggrieved at finding himself robbed of the Aeolid. Tissaphernes, lending willing
ears to the proposal, had answered: "First cross over with me in Caria, and then we will take
counsel on these matters." But being arrived in Caria, they determined to establish garrisons
of some strength in the various fortresses, and so crossed back again into Ionia.

Hearing that the satraps had recrossed the Maeander, Dercylidas grew apprehensive for the district
which lay there unprotected. "If Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus," he said to Pharax, "chose to
make a descent, they could harry the country right and left." In this mind he followed suit,
and recrossed the frontier too. And now as they marched on, preserving no sort of battle order--on
the supposition that the enemy had got far ahead of them into the district of Ephesus--suddenly
they caught sight of his scouts perched on some monumental structures facing them. To send
up scouts into similar edifices and towers on their own side was the work of a few moments,
and before them lay revealed the long lines of troops drawn up just where their road lay. These
were the Carians, with their white shields, and the whole Persian troops there present, with
all the Hellenic contingents belonging to either satrap. Besides these there was a great cloud
of cavalry: on the right wing the squadrons of Tissaphernes, and on the left those of Pharnabazus.

Seeing how matters lay, Dercylidas ordered the generals of brigade and captains to form into
line as quickly as possible, eight deep, placing the light infantry on the fringe of battle,
with the cavalry--such cavalry, that is, and of such numerical strength, as he chanced to have.
Meanwhile, as general, he sacrificed. (11) During this interval the troops from Peloponnese
kept quiet in preparation as for battle. Not so the troops from Priene and Achilleum, from
the islands and the Ionic cities, some of whom left their arms in the corn, which stood thick
and deep in the plain of the Maeander, and took to their heels; while those who remained at
their posts gave evident signs that their steadiness would not last. Pharnabazus, it was reported,
had given orders to engage; but Tissaphernes, who recalled his experience of his own exploits
with the Cyreian army, and assumed that all other Hellenes were of similar mettle, had no desire
to engage, but sent to Dercylidas saying, he should be glad to meet him in conference. So Dercylidas,
attended by the pick of his troops, horse and foot, in personal attendance on himself, (12)
went forward to meet the envoys. He told them that for his own part he had made his preparations
to engage, as they themselves might see, but still, if the satraps were minded to meet in conference,
he had nothing to say against it--"Only, in that case, there must be mutual exchange of hostages
and other pledges."

 (11) I.e. according to custom on the eve of battle. See "Pol. Lac."
    xiii. 8.

 (12) Lit. "they were splendid fellows to look at." See "Anab." II.
    iii. 3.

When this proposal had been agreed to and carried out, the two armies retired for the night--the
Asiatics to Tralles in Caria, the Hellenes to Leucophrys, where was a temple (13) of Artemis
of great sanctity, and a sandy-bottomed lake more than a furlong in extent, fed by a spring
of ever-flowing water fit for drinking and warm. For the moment so much was effected. On the
next day they met at the place appointed, and it was agreed that they should mutually ascertain
the terms on which either party was willing to make peace. On his side, Dercylidas insisted
that the king should grant independence to the Hellenic cities; while Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus
demanded the evacuation of the country by the Hellenic army, and the withdrawal of the Lacedaemonian
governors from the cities. After this interchange of ideas a truce was entered into, so as
to allow time for the reports of the proceedings to be sent by Dercylidas to Lacedaemon, and
by Tissaphernes to the king.

 (13) Lately unearthed. See "Class. Rev." v. 8, p. 391.

B.C. 401 (?). Whilst such was the conduct of affairs in Asia under the guidance of Dercylidas,
the Lacedaemonians at home were at the same time no less busily employed with other matters.
They cherished a long-standing embitterment against the Eleians, the grounds of which were
that the Eleians had once (14) contracted an alliance with the Athenians, Argives, and Mantineans;
moreover, on pretence of a sentence registered against the Lacedaemonians, they had excluded
them from the horse-race and gymnastic contests. Nor was that the sum of their offending. They
had taken and scourged Lichas, (15) under the following circumstances:--Being a Spartan, he
had formally consigned his chariot to the Thebans, and when the Thebans were proclaimed victors
he stepped forward to crown his charioteer; whereupon, in spite of his grey hairs, the Eleians
put those indignities upon him and expelled him from the festival. Again, at a date subsequent
to that occurrence, Agis being sent to offer sacrifice to Olympian Zeus in accordance with
the bidding of an oracle, the Eleians would not suffer him to offer prayer for victory in war,
asserting that the ancient law and custom (16) forbade Hellenes to consult the god for war
with Hellenes; and Agis was forced to go away without offering the sacrifice.

 (16) See Grote, "H. G." ix. 311 note.

In consequence of all these annoyances the ephors and the Assembly determined "to bring the
men of Elis to their senses." Thereupon they sent an embassy to that state, announcing that
the authorities of Lacedaemon deemed it just and right that they should leave the country (17)
townships in the territory of Elis free and independent. This the Eleians flatly refused to
do. The cities in question were theirs by right of war. Thereupon the ephors called out the
ban. The leader of the expedition was Agis. He invaded Elis through Achaia (18) by the Larisus;
but the army had hardly set foot on the enemy's soil and the work of devastation begun, when
an earthquake took place, and Agis, taking this as a sign from Heaven, marched back again out
of the country and disbanded his army. Thereat the men of Elis were much more emboldened, and
sent embassies to various cities which they knew to be hostile to the Lacedaemonians.

 (17) Lit. "perioecid."

    and Elis. See Strabo, viii. 387.

The year had not completed its revolution (19) ere the ephors again called out the ban against
Elis, and the invading host of Agis was this time swelled by the rest of the allies, including
the Athenians; the Boeotians and Corinthians alone excepted. The Spartan king now entered through
Aulon, (20) and the men of Lepreum (21) at once revolted from the Eleians and gave in their
adhesion to the Spartan, and simultaneously with these the Macistians and their next-door neighbours
the Epitalians. As he crossed the river further adhesions followed, on the part of the Letrinians,
the Amphidolians, and the Marganians.

 (21) See below, VI. v. 11; Paus. IV. xv. 8.

B.C. 400 (?). Upon this he pushed on into Olympian territory and did sacrifice to Olympian
Zeus. There was no attempt to stay his proceedings now. After sacrifice he marched against
the capital, (22) devastating and burning the country as he went. Multitudes of cattle, multitudes
of slaves, were the fruits of conquest yielded, insomuch that the fame thereof spread, and
many more Arcadians and Achaeans flocked to join the standard of the invader and to share in
the plunder. In fact, the expedition became one enormous foray. Here was the chance to fill
all the granaries of Peloponnese with corn. When he had reached the capital, the beautiful
suburbs and gymnasia became a spoil to the troops; but the city itself, though it lay open
before him a defenceless and unwalled town, he kept aloof from. He would not, rather than could
not, take it. Such was the explanation given. Thus the country was a prey to devastation, and
the invaders massed round Cyllene.

 (22) I.e. Elis, of which Cyllene is the port town. For the wealth of
    the district, see Polyb. iv. 73; and below, VII. iv. 33.

Then the friends of a certain Xenias--a man of whom it was said that he might measure the silver
coin, inherited from his father, by the bushel--wishing to be the leading instrument in bringing
over the state to Lacedaemon, rushed out of the house, sword in hand, and began a work of butchery.
Amongst other victims they killed a man who strongly resembled the leader of the democratic
party, Thrasydaeus. (23) Everyone believed it was really Thrasydaeus who was slain. The popular
party were panic-stricken, and stirred neither hand nor foot. On their side, the cut-throats
poured their armed bands into the market-place. But Thrasydaeus was laid asleep the while where
the fumes of wine had overpowered him. When the people came to discover that their hero was
not dead, they crowded round his house this side and that, (24) like a swarm of bees clinging
to their leader; and as soon as Thrasydaeus had put himself in the van, with the people at
his back, a battle was fought, and the people won. And those who had laid their hands to deeds
of butchery went as exiles to the Lacedaemonians.

 (23) See Paus. III. viii. 4. He was a friend of Lysias ("Vit. X. Orat.
    835").

 (24) The house was filled to overflowing by the clustering close-
    packed crowd.

After a while Agis himself retired, recrossing the Alpheus; but he was careful to leave a garrison
in Epitalium near that river, with Lysippus as governor, and the exiles from Elis along with
him. Having done so, he disbanded his army and returned home himself.

B.C. 400-399 (?). (25) During the rest of the summer and the ensuing winter the territory of
the Eleians was ravaged and ransacked by Lysippus and his troops, until Thrasydaeus, the following
summer, sent to Lacedaemon and agreed to dismantle the walls of Phea and Cyllene, and to grant
autonomy to the Triphylian townships (26)--together with Phrixa and Epitalium, the Letrinians,
Amphidolians, and Marganians; and besides these to the Acroreians and to Lasion, a place claimed
by the Arcadians. With regard to Epeium, a town midway between Heraea and Macistus, the Eleians
claimed the right to keep it, on the plea that they had purchased the whole district from its
then owners, for thirty talents, (27) which sum they had actually paid. But the Lacedaemonians,
acting on the principle "that a purchase which forcibly deprives the weaker party of his possession
is no more justifiable than a seizure by violence," compelled them to emancipate Epeium also.
From the presidency of the temple of Olympian Zeus, however, they did not oust them; not that
it belonged to Elis of ancient right, but because the rival claimants, (28) it was felt, were
"villagers," hardly equal to the exercise of the presidency. After these concessions, peace
and alliance between the Eleians and the Lacedaemonians were established, and the war between
Elis and Sparta ceased.

 (25) Grote ("H. G." ix. 316) discusses the date of this war between
    Elis and Sparta, which he thinks, reaches over three different
    years, 402-400 B.C. But Curtius (vol. iv. Eng. tr. p. 196)
    disagrees: "The Eleian war must have occurred in 401-400 B.C., and
    Grote rightly conjectures that the Eleians were anxious to bring
    it to a close before the celebration of the festival. But he errs
    in extending its duration over three years." See Diod. xiv. 17.
    24; Paus. III. viii. 2 foll.

 (26) Grote remarks: "There is something perplexing in Xenophon's
    description of the Triphylian townships which the Eleians
    surrendered" ("H. G." ix. 315). I adopt Grote's emend. {kai
    Phrixan}. See Busolt, op. cit. p. 176.

After this Agis came to Delphi and offered as a sacrifice a tenth of the spoil. On his return
journey he fell ill at Heraea--being by this time an old man--and was carried back to Lacedaemon.
He survived the journey, but being there arrived, death speedily overtook him. He was buried
with a sepulchre transcending in solemnity the lot of ordinary mortality. (1)

 (1) See "Ages." xi. 16; "Pol. Lac." xv. 9.

When the holy days of mourning were accomplished, and it was necessary to choose another king,
there were rival claimants to the throne. Leotychides claimed it as the son, Agesilaus as the
brother, of Agis. Then Leotychides protested: "Yet consider, Agesilaus, the law bids not 'the
king's brother,' but 'the king's son' to be king; only if there chance to be no son, in that
case shall the brother of the king be king." Agesilaus: "Then must I needs be king." Leotychides:
"How so, seeing that I am not dead?" Agesilaus: "Because he whom you call your father denied
you, saying, 'Leotychides is no son of mine.'" Leotychides: "Nay, but my mother, who would
know far better than he, said, and still to-day says, I am." Agesilaus: "Nay, but the god himself,
Poteidan, laid his finger on thy falsity when by his earthquake he drove forth thy father from
the bridal chamber into the light of day; and time, 'that tells no lies,' as the proverb has
it, bare witness to the witness of the god; for just ten months from the moment at which he
fled and was no more seen within that chamber, you were born." (2) So they reasoned together.

    327) for a discussion of the whole passage. He thinks Xenophon
    wrote {ex ou gar toi ephugen} ({o sos pater}, i.e. adulterer) {ek
    to thalamo dekato meni tu ephus}. The Doric {ek to thalamo} was
    corrupted into {en to thalamo} and {kai ephane} inserted. This
    corrupt reading Plutarch had before him, and hence his distorted
    version of the story.

Diopethes, (3) a great authority upon oracles, supported Leotychides. There was an oracle of
Apollo, he urged, which said "Beware of the lame reign." But Diopethes was met by Lysander,
who in behalf of Agesilaus demurred to this interpretation put upon the language of the god.
If they were to beware of a lame reign, it meant not, beware lest a man stumble and halt, but
rather, beware of him in whose veins flows not the blood of Heracles; most assuredly the kingdom
would halt, and that would be a lame reign in very deed, whensoever the descendants of Heracles
should cease to lead the state. Such were the arguments on either side, after hearing which
the city chose Agesilaus to be king.

 (3) See Plut. "Ages." ii. 4; "Lys." xxii. (Clough, iv. 3; iii. 129);
    Paus. III. viii. 5.

Now Agesilaus had not been seated on the throne one year when, as he sacrificed one of the
appointed sacrifices in behalf of the city, (4) the soothsayer warned him, saying: "The gods
reveal a conspiracy of the most fearful character"; and when the king sacrificed a second time,
he said: "The aspect of the victims is now even yet more terrible"; but when he had sacrificed
for the third time, the soothsayer exclaimed: "O Agesilaus, the sign is given to me, even as
though we were in the very midst of the enemy." Thereupon they sacrificed to the deities who
avert evil and work salvation, and so barely obtained good omens and ceased sacrificing. Nor
had five days elapsed after the sacrifices were ended, ere one came bringing information to
the ephors of a conspiracy, and named Cinadon as the ringleader; a young man robust of body
as of soul, but not one of the peers. (5) Accordingly the ephors questioned their informant:
"How say you the occurrence is to take place?" and he who gave the information answered: "Cinadon
took me to the limit of the market-place, and bade me count how many Spartans there were in
the market-place; and I counted--'king, ephors, and elders, and others--maybe forty. But tell
me, Cinadon,' I said to him, 'why have you bidden me count them?' and he answered me: 'Those
men, I would have you know, are your sworn foes; and all those others, more than four thousand,
congregated there are your natural allies.' Then he took and showed me in the streets, here
one and there two of 'our enemies,' as we chanced to come across them, and all the rest 'our
natural allies'; and so again running through the list of Spartans to be found in the country
districts, he still kept harping on that string: 'Look you, on each estate one foeman--the
master--and all the rest allies.'" The ephors asked: "How many do you reckon are in the secret
of this matter?" The informant answered: "On that point also he gave me to understand that
there were by no means many in their secret who were prime movers of the affair, but those
few to be depended on; 'and to make up,' said he, 'we ourselves are in their secret, all the
rest of them--helots, enfranchised, inferiors, provincials, one and all. (6) Note their demeanour
when Spartans chance to be the topic of their talk. Not one of them can conceal the delight
it would give him if he might eat up every Spartan raw.'" (7) Then, as the inquiry went on,
the question came: "And where did they propose to find arms?" The answer followed: "He explained
that those of us, of course, who are enrolled in regiments have arms of our own already, and
as for the mass--he led the way to the war foundry, and showed me scores and scores of knives,
of swords, of spits, hatchets, and axes, and reaping-hooks. 'Anything or everything,' he told
me, 'which men use to delve in earth, cut timber, or quarry stone, would serve our purpose;
nay, the instruments used for other arts would in nine cases out of ten furnish weapons enough
and to spare, especially when dealing with unarmed antagonists.'" Once more being asked what
time the affair was to come off, he replied his orders were "not to leave the city."

As the result of their inquiry the ephors were persuaded that the man's statements were based
upon things he had really seen, (8) and they were so alarmed that they did not even venture
to summon the Little Assembly, (9) as it was named; but holding informal meetings among themselves--a
few senators here and a few there--they determined to send Cinadon and others of the young
men to Aulon, with instructions to apprehend certain of the inhabitants and helots, whose names
were written on the scytale (or scroll). (10) He had further instructions to capture another
resident in Aulon; this was a woman, the fashionable beauty of the place--supposed to be the
arch-corruptress of all Lacedaemonians, young and old, who visited Aulon. It was not the first
mission of the sort on which Cinadon had been employed by the ephors. It was natural, therefore,
that the ephors should entrust him with the scytale on which the names of the suspects were
inscribed; and in answer to his inquiry which of the young men he was to take with him, they
said: "Go and order the eldest of the Hippagretae (11) (or commanders of horse) to let you
have six or seven who chance to be there." But they had taken care to let the commander know
whom he was to send, and that those sent should also know that their business was to capture
Cinadon. Further, the authorities instructed Cinadon that they would send three waggons to
save bringing back his captives on foot--concealing as deeply as possible the fact that he,
and he alone, was the object of the mission. Their reason for not securing him in the city
was that they did not really know the extent of the mischief; and they wished, in the first
instance, to learn from Cinadon who his accomplices were before these latter could discover
they were informed against and effect their escape. His captors were to secure him first, and
having learnt from him the names of his confederates, to write them down and send them as quickly
as possible to the ephors. The ephors, indeed, were so much concerned about the whole occurrence
that they further sent a company of horse to assist their agents at Aulon. (12) As soon as
the capture was effected, and one of the horsemen was back with the list of names taken down
on the information of Cinadon, they lost no time in apprehending the soothsayer Tisamenus and
the rest who were the principals in the conspiracy. When Cinadon (13) himself was brought back
and cross-examined, and had made a full confession of the whole plot, his plans, and his accomplices,
they put to him one final question: "What was your object in undertaking this business?" He
answered: "I wished to be inferior to no man in Lacedaemon." Let that be as it might, his fate
was to be taken out forthwith in irons, just as he was, and to be placed with his two hands
and his neck in the collar, and so under scourge and goad to be driven, himself and his accomplices,
round the city. Thus upon the heads of those was visited the penalty of their offences.

B.C. 397. (1) It was after the incidents just recorded that a Syracusan named Herodas brought
news to Lacedaemon. He had chanced to be in Phoenicia with a certain shipowner, and was struck
by the number of Phoenician triremes which he observed, some coming into harbour from other
ports, others already there with their ships' companies complete, while others again were still
completing their equipments. Nor was it only what he saw, but he had heard say further that
there were to be three hundred of these vessels all told; whereupon he had taken passage on
the first sailing ship bound for Hellas. He was in haste to lay this information before the
Lacedaemonians, feeling sure that the king and Tissaphernes were concerned in these preparations--though
where the fleet was to act, or against whom, he would not venture to predict.

 (1) See Grote, "H. G." ix. 353, for chronology, etc.

These reports threw the Lacedaemonians into a flutter of expectation and anxiety. They summoned
a meeting of the allies, and began to deliberate as to what ought to be done. Lysander, convinced
of the enormous superiority of the Hellenic navy, and with regard to land forces drawing an
obvious inference from the exploits and final deliverance of the troops with Cyrus, persuaded
Agesilaus, to undertake a campaign into Asia, provided the authorities would furnish him with
thirty Spartans, two thousand of the enfranchised, (2) and contingents of the allies amounting
to six thousand men. Apart from these calculations, Lysander had a personal object: he wished
to accompany the king himself, and by his aid to re-establish the decarchies originally set
up by himself in the different cities, but at a later date expelled through the action of the
ephors, who had issued a fiat re-establishing the old order of constitution.

 (2) Technically, "neodamodes."

B.C. 396. To this offer on the part of Agesilaus to undertake such an expedition the Lacedaemonians
responded by presenting him with all he asked for, and six months' provisions besides. When
the hour of departure came he offered all such sacrifices as are necessary, and lastly those
"before crossing the border," (3) and so set out. This done, he despatched to the several states
(4) messengers with directions as to the numbers to be sent from each, and the points of rendezvous;
but for himself he was minded to go and do sacrifice at Aulis, even as Agamemnon had offered
sacrifice in that place ere he set sail for Troy. But when he had reached the place and had
begun to sacrifice, the Boeotarchs (5) being apprised of his design, sent a body of cavalry
and bade him desist from further sacrificing; (6) and lighting upon victims already offered,
they hurled them from off the altars, scattering the fragments. Then Agesilaus, calling the
gods to witness, got on board his trireme in bitter indignation, and sailed away. Arrived at
Geraestus, he there collected as large a portion of his troops as possible, and with the armada
made sail for Ephesus.

 (3) "Pol. Lac." xiii. 2 foll.

 (4) Or, "To the several cities he had already despatched messengers
    with directions," etc.; see Paus. III. ix. 1-3.

 (5) See Freeman, "Hist. of Federal Government," ch. iv. "Constitution
    of the Boeotian League," pp. 162, 163. The Boeotarchs, as
    representatives of the several Boeotian cities, were the supreme
    military commanders of the League, and, as it would appear, the
    general administrators of Federal affairs. "The Boeotarchs of
    course command at Delion, but they also act as administrative
    magistrates of the League by hindering Agesilaus from sacrificing
    at Aulis."

 (6) Plut. "Ages." vi.; "Pelop." xxi. See Breitenb. op. cit. Praef. p.
    xvi.; and below, III. v. 5; VI. iv. 23.

When he had reached that city the first move was made by Tissaphernes, who sent asking, "With
what purpose he was come thither?" And the Spartan king made answer: "With the intention that
the cities in Asia shall be independent even as are the cities in our quarter of Hellas." In
answer to this Tissaphernes said: "If you on your part choose to make a truce whilst I send
ambassadors to the king, I think you may well arrange the matter, and sail back home again,
if so you will." "Willing enough should I be," replied Agesilaus, "were I not persuaded that
you are cheating me." "Nay, but it is open to you," replied the satrap, "to exact a surety
for the execution of the terms... 'Provided always that you, Tissaphernes, carry out what you
say without deceit, we on our side will abstain from injuring your dominion in any respect
whatever during the truce.'" (7) Accordingly in the presence of three commissioners--Herippidas,
Dercylidas, and Megillus--Tissaphernes took an oath in the words prescribed: "Verily and indeed,
I will effect peace honestly and without guile." To which the commissioners, on behalf of Agesilaus,
swore a counter-oath: "Verily and indeed, provided Tissaphernes so acts, we on our side will
observe the truce."

 (7) For this corrupt passage, see Hartman, "Anal. Xen." p. 332; also
    Otto Keller's critical edition of the "Hellenica" (Lips,
    MDCCCLXXX.)

Tissaphernes at once gave the lie to what he had sworn. Instead of adhering to peace he sent
up to demand a large army from the king, in addition to what he already had. But Agesilaus,
though he was fully alive to these proceedings, adhered as rigidly as ever to the truce.

To keep quiet and enjoy leisure was his duty, in the exercise of which he wore away the time
at Ephesus. But in reference to the organisation of the several states it was a season of vehement
constitutional disturbance in the several cities; that is to say, there were neither democracies
as in the old days of the Athenians, nor yet were there decarchies as in the days of Lysander.
But here was Lysander back again. Every one recognised him, and flocked to him with petitions
for one favour or another, which he was to obtain for them from Agesilaus. A crowd of suitors
danced attendance on his heels, and formed so conspicuous a retinue that Agesilaus, any one
would have supposed, was the private person and Lysander the king. All this was maddening to
Agesilaus, as was presently plain. As to the rest of the Thirty, jealousy did not suffer them
to keep silence, and they put it plainly to Agesilaus that the super-regal splendour in which
Lysander lived was a violation of the constitution. So when Lysander took upon himself to introduce
some of his petitioners to Agesilaus, the latter turned them a deaf ear. Their being aided
and abetted by Lysander was sufficient; he sent them away discomfited. At length, as time after
time things turned out contrary to his wishes, Lysander himself perceived the position of affairs.
He now no longer suffered that crowd to follow him, and gave those who asked him help in anything
plainly to understand that they would gain nothing, but rather be losers, by his intervention.
But being bitterly annoyed at the degradation put upon him, he came to the king and said to
him: "Ah, Agesilaus, how well you know the art of humbling your friends!" "Ay, indeed," the
king replied; "those of them whose one idea it is to appear greater than myself; if I did not
know how also to requite with honour those who work for my good, I should be ashamed." And
Lysander said: "maybe there is more reason in your doings than ever guided my conduct;" adding,
"Grant me for the rest one favour, so shall I cease to blush at the loss of my influence with
you, and you will cease to be embarrassed by my presence. Send me off on a mission somewhere;
wherever I am I will strive to be of service to you." Such was the proposal of Lysander. Agesilaus
resolved to act upon it, and despatched Lysander to the Hellespont. And this is what befell.
(8) Lysander, being made aware of a slight which had been put upon Spithridates the Persian
by Pharnabazus, got into conversation with the injured man, and so worked upon him that he
was persuaded to bring his children and his personal belongings, and with a couple of hundred
troops to revolt. The next step was to deposit all the goods safely in Cyzicus, and the last
to get on shipboard with Spithridates and his son, and so to present himself with his Persian
friends to Agesilaus. Agesilaus, on his side, was delighted at the transaction, and set himself
at once to get information about Pharnabazus, his territory and his government.

 (8) See "Ages." iii. 3; "Anab." VI. v. 7.

Meanwhile Tissaphernes had waxed bolder. A large body of troops had been sent down by the king.
On the strength of that he declared war against Agesilaus, if he did not instantly withdraw
his troops from Asia. The Lacedaemonians there (9) present, no less than the allies, received
the news with profound vexation, persuaded as they were that Agesilaus had no force capable
of competing with the king's grand armament. But a smile lit up the face of Agesilaus as he
bade the ambassadors return to Tissaphernes and tell him that he was much in his debt for the
perjury by which he had won the enmity of Heaven and made the very gods themselves allies of
Hellas. He at once issued a general order to the troops to equip themselves for a forward movement.
He warned the cities through which he must pass in an advance upon Caria, to have markets in
readiness, and lastly, he despatched a message to the Ionian, Aeolian, and Hellespontine communities
to send their contingents to join him at Ephesus.

 (9) I.e. at Ephesus.

Tissaphernes, putting together the facts that Agesilaus had no cavalry and that Caria was a
region unadapted to that arm, and persuaded in his own mind also that the Spartan could not
but cherish wrath against himself personally for his chicanery, felt convinced that he was
really intending to invade Caria, and that the satrap's palace was his final goal. Accordingly
he transferred the whole of his infantry to that province, and proceeded to lead his cavalry
round into the plain of the Maeander. Here he conceived himself capable of trampling the Hellenes
under foot with his horsemen before they could reach the craggy districts where no cavalry
could operate.

But, instead of marching straight into Caria, Agesilaus turned sharp off in the opposite direction
towards Phrygia. Picking up various detachments of troops which met him on his march, he steadily
advanced, laying cities prostrate before him, and by the unexpectedness of his attack reaping
a golden harvest of spoil. As a rule the march was prosecuted safely; but not far from Dascylium
his advanced guard of cavalry were pushing on towards a knoll to take a survey of the state
of things in front, when, as chance would have it, a detachment of cavalry sent forward by
Pharnabazus--the corps, in fact, of Rhathines and his natural brother Bagaeus--just about equal
to the Hellenes in number, also came galloping up to the very knoll in question. The two bodies
found themselves face to face not one hundred and fifty yards (10) apart, and for the first
moment or two stood stock still. The Hellenic horse were drawn up like an ordinary phalanx
four deep, the barbarians presenting a narrow front of twelve or thereabouts, and a very disproportionate
depth. There was a moment's pause, and then the barbarians, taking the initiative, charged.
There was a hand-to-hand tussle, in which any Hellene who succeeded in striking his man shivered
his lance with the blow, while the Persian troopers, armed with cornel-wood javelins, speedily
despatched a dozen men and a couple of horses. (11) At this point the Hellenic cavalry turned
and fled. But as Agesilaus came up to the rescue with his heavy infantry, the Asiatics were
forced in their turn to withdraw, with the loss of one man slain. This cavalry engagement gave
them pause. Agesilaus on the day following it offered sacrifice. "Was he to continue his advance?"
But the victims proved hopeless. (12) There was nothing for it after this manifestation but
to turn and march towards the sea. It was clear enough to his mind that without a proper cavalry
force it would be impossible to conduct a campaign in the flat country. Cavalry, therefore,
he must get, or be driven to mere guerilla warfare. With this view he drew up a list of all
the wealthiest inhabitants belonging to the several cities of those parts. Their duty would
be to support a body of cavalry, with the proviso, however, that any one contributing a horse,
arms, and rider, up to the standard, would be exempted from personal service. The effect was
instantaneous. The zeal with which the recipients of these orders responded could hardly have
been greater if they had been seeking substitutes to die for them.

B.C. 395. After this, at the first indication of spring, he collected the whole of his army
at Ephesus. But the army needed training. With that object he proposed a series of prizes--prizes
to the heavy infantry regiments, to be won by those who presented their men in the best condition;
prizes for the cavalry regiments which could ride best; prizes for those divisions of peltasts
and archers which proved most efficient in their respective duties. And now the gymnasiums
were a sight to see, thronged as they were, one and all, with warriors stripping for exercise;
or again, the hippodrome crowded with horses and riders performing their evolutions; or the
javelin men and archers going through their peculiar drill. In fact, the whole city where he
lay presented under his hands a spectacle not to be forgotten. The market-place literally teemed
with horses, arms, and accoutrements of all sorts for sale. The bronze-worker, the carpenter,
the smith, the leather-cutter, the painter and embosser, were all busily engaged in fabricating
the implements of war; so that the city of Ephesus itself was fairly converted into a military
workshop. (13) It would have done a man's heart good to see those long lines of soldiers with
Agesilaus at their head, as they stepped gaily be-garlanded from the gymnasiums to dedicate
their wreaths to the goddess Artemis. Nor can I well conceive of elements more fraught with
hope than were here combined. Here were reverence and piety towards Heaven; here practice in
war and military training; here discipline with habitual obedience to authority. But contempt
for one's enemy will infuse a kind of strength in battle. So the Spartan leader argued; and
with a view to its production he ordered the quartermasters to put up the prisoners who had
been captured by his foraging bands for auction, stripped naked; so that his Hellenic soldiery,
as they looked at the white skins which had never been bared to sun and wind, the soft limbs
unused to toil through constant riding in carriages, came to the conclusion that war with such
adversaries would differ little from a fight with women.

 (13) See Plut. "Marc." (Clough, ii. 262); Polyb. "Hist." x. 20.

By this date a full year had elapsed since the embarkation of Agesilaus, and the time had come
for the Thirty with Lysander to sail back home, and for their successors, with Herippidas,
to arrive. Among these Agesilaus appointed Xenocles and another to the command of the cavalry,
Scythes to that of the heavy infantry of the enfranchised, (14) Herippidas to that of the Cyreians,
and Migdon to that of the contingents from the states. Agesilaus gave them to understand that
he intended to lead them forthwith by the most expeditious route against the stronghold of
the country, (15) so that without further ceremony they might prepare their minds and bodies
for the tug of battle. Tissaphernes, however, was firmly persuaded that this was only talk
intended to deceive him; Agesilaus would this time certainly invade Caria. Accordingly he repeated
his former tactics, transporting his infantry bodily into Caria and posting his cavalry in
the valley of the Maeander. But Agesilaus was as good as his word, and at once invaded the
district of Sardis. A three days' march through a region denuded of the enemy threw large supplies
into his hands. On the fourth day the cavalry of the enemy approached. Their general ordered
the officer in charge of his baggage-train to cross the Pactolus and encamp, while his troopers,
catching sight of stragglers from the Hellenic force scattered in pursuit of booty, put several
of them to the sword. Perceiving which, Agesilaus ordered his cavalry to the rescue; and the
Persians on their side, seeing their advance, collected together in battle order to receive
them, with dense squadrons of horse, troop upon troop. The Spartan, reflecting that the enemy
had as yet no infantry to support him, whilst he had all branches of the service to depend
upon, concluded that the critical moment had arrived at which to risk an engagement. In this
mood he sacrificed, and began advancing his main line of battle against the serried lines of
cavalry in front of him, at the same time ordering the flower of his heavy infantry--the ten-years-service
men (16)--to close with them at a run, and the peltasts to bring up their supports at the double.
The order passed to his cavalry was to charge in confidence that he and the whole body of his
troops were close behind them. The cavalry charge was received by the Persians without flinching,
but presently finding themselves environed by the full tide of war they swerved. Some found
a speedy grave within the river, but the mass of them gradually made good their escape. The
Hellenes followed close on the heels of the flying foe and captured his camp. here the peltasts
not unnaturally fell to pillaging; whereupon Agesilaus planted his troops so as to form a cordon
enclosing the property of friends and foes alike. The spoil taken was considerable; it fetched
more than seventy talents, (17) not to mention the famous camels, subsequently brought over
by Agesilaus into Hellas, which were captured here. At the moment of the battle Tissaphernes
lay in Sardis. Hence the Persians argued that they had been betrayed by the satrap. And the
king of Persia, coming to a like conclusion himself that Tissaphernes was to blame for the
evil turn of his affairs, sent down Tithraustes and beheaded him. (18)

 (18) See Diod. xiv. 80.

This done, Tithraustes sent an embassy to Agesilaus with a message as follows: "The author
of all our trouble, yours and ours, Agesilaus, has paid the penalty of his misdoings; the king
therefore asks of you first that you should sail back home in peace; secondly, that the cities
in Asia secured in their autonomy should continue to render him the ancient tribute." To this
proposition Agesilaus made answer that "without the authorities at home he could do nothing
in the matter." "Then do you, at least," replied Tithraustes, "while awaiting advice from Lacedaemon,
withdraw into the territory of Pharnabazus. Have I not avenged you of your enemy?" "While,
then, I am on my way thither," rejoined Agesilaus, "will you support my army with provisions?"
On this wise Tithraustes handed him thirty talents, (19) which the other took, and forthwith
began his march into Phrygia (the Phrygia of Pharnabazus). He lay in the plain district above
Cyme, (20) when a message reached him from the home authorities, giving him absolute disposal
of the naval forces, (21) with the right to appoint the admiral of his choice. This course
the Lacedaemonians were led to adopt by the following considerations: If, they argued, the
same man were in command of both services, the land force would be greatly strengthened through
the concentration of the double force at any point necessary; and the navy likewise would be
far more useful through the immediate presence and co-operation of the land force where needed.
Apprised of these measures, Agesilaus in the first instance sent an order to the cities on
the islands and the seaboard to fit out as many ships of war as they severally might deem desirable.
The result was a new navy, consisting of the vessels thus voluntarily furnished by the states,
with others presented by private persons out of courtesy to their commander, and amounting
in all to a fleet of one hundred and twenty sail. The admiral whom he selected was Peisander,
his wife's brother, a man of genuine ambition and of a vigorous spirit, but not sufficiently
expert in the details of equipment to achieve a great naval success. Thus while Peisander set
off to attend to naval matters, Agesilaus continued his march whither he was bound to Phrygia.

But now Tithraustes seemed to have discovered in Agesilaus a disposition to despise the fortunes
of the Persian monarch--he evidently had no intention to withdraw from Asia; on the contrary,
he was cherishing hopes vast enough to include the capture of the king himself. Being at his
wits' end how to manage matters, he resolved to send Timocrates the Rhodian to Hellas with
a gift of gold worthy fifty silver talents, (1) and enjoined upon him to endeavour to exchange
solemn pledges with the leading men in the several states, binding them to undertake a war
against Lacedaemon. Timocrates arrived and began to dole out his presents. In Thebes he gave
gifts to Androcleidas, Ismenias, and Galaxidorus; in Corinth to Timolaus and Polyanthes; in
Argos to Cylon and his party. The Athenians, (2) though they took no share of the gold, were
none the less eager for the war, being of opinion that empire was theirs by right. (3) The
recipients of the moneys forthwith began covertly to attack the Lacedaemonians in their respective
states, and, when they had brought these to a sufficient pitch of hatred, bound together the
most important of them in a confederacy.

    Breitinbach suggests, {enomizon de oukh outon to arkhesthai},
    translate "but thought it was not for them to take the
    initiative."

But it was clear to the leaders in Thebes that, unless some one struck the first blow, the
Lacedaemonians would never be brought to break the truce with their allies. They therefore
persuaded the Opuntian Locrians (4) to levy moneys on a debatable district, (5) jointly claimed
by the Phocians and themselves, when the Phocians would be sure to retaliate by an attack on
Locris. These expectations were fulfilled. The Phocians immediately invaded Locris and seized
moneys on their side with ample interest. Then Androcleidas and his friends lost no time in
persuading the Thebans to assist the Locrians, on the ground that it was no debatable district
which had been entered by the Phocians, but the admittedly friendly and allied territory of
Locris itself. The counter-invasion of Phocis and pillage of their country by the Thebans promptly
induced the Phocians to send an embassy to Lacedaemon. In claiming assistance they explained
that the war was not of their own seeking, but that they had attacked the Locrians in self-defence.
On their side the Lacedaemonians were glad enough to seize a pretext for marching upon the
Thebans, against whom they cherished a long-standing bitterness. They had not forgotten the
claim which the Thebans had set up to a tithe for Apollo in Deceleia, (6) nor yet their refusal
to support Lacedaemon in the attack on Piraeus; (7) and they accused them further of having
persuaded the Corinthians not to join that expedition. Nor did they fail to call to mind some
later proceedings of the Thebans--their refusal to allow Agesilaus to sacrifice in Aulis; (8)
their snatching the victims already offered and hurling them from the altars; their refusal
to join the same general in a campaign directed even against Asia. (9) The Lacedaemonians further
reasoned that now, if ever, was the favourable moment to conduct an expedition against the
Thebans, and once for all to put a stop to their insolent behaviour towards them. Affairs in
Asia were prospering under the strong arm of Agesilaus, and in Hellas they had no other war
on hand to trammel their movements. Such, therefore, being the general view of the situation
adopted at Lacedaemon, the ephors proceeded to call out the ban. Meanwhile they despatched
Lysander to Phocis with orders to put himself at the head of the Phocians along with the Oetaeans,
Heracleotes, Melians, and Aenianians, and to march upon Haliartus; before the walls of which
place Pausanias, the destined leader of the expedition, undertook to present himself at the
head of the Lacedaemonians and other Peloponnesian forces by a specified date. Lysander not
only carried out his instructions to the letter, but going a little beyond them, succeeded
in detaching Orchomenus from Thebes. (10) Pausanias, on the other hand, after finding the sacrifice
for crossing the frontier favourable, sat down at Tegea and set about despatching to and fro
the commandants of allied troops whilst contentedly awaiting the soldiers from the provincial
(11) districts of Laconia.

And now that it was fully plain to the Thebans that the Lacedaemonians would invade their territory,
they sent ambassadors to Athens, who spoke as follows:--

"Men of Athens, it is a mistake on your part to blame us for certain harsh resolutions concerning
Athens at the conclusion of the war. (12) That vote was not authorised by the state of Thebes.
It was the utterance merely of one man, (13) who was at that time seated in the congress of
the allies. A more important fact is that when the Lacedaemonians summoned us to attack Piraeus
(14) the collective state of Thebes passed a resolution refusing to join in the campaign. As
then you are to a large extent the cause of the resentment which the Lacedaemonians feel towards
us, we consider it only fair that you in your turn should render us assistance. Still more
do we demand of you, sirs, who were of the city party at that date, to enter heart and soul
into war with the Lacedaemonians. For what were their services to you? They first deliberately
converted you into an oligarchy and placed you in hostility to the democracy, and then they
came with a great force under guise of being your allies, and delivered you over to the majority,
so that, for any service they rendered you, you were all dead men; and you owe your lives to
our friends here, the people of Athens. (15)

"But to pass on--we all know, men of Athens, that you would like to recover the empire which
you formerly possessed; and how can you compass your object better than by coming to the aid
yourselves of the victims of Lacedaemonian injustice? Is it their wide empire of which you
are afraid? Let not that make cowards of you--much rather let it embolden you as you lay to
heart and ponder your own case. When your empire was widest then the crop of your enemies was
thickest. Only so long as they found no opportunity to revolt did they keep their hatred of
you dark; but no sooner had they found a champion in Lacedaemon than they at once showed what
they really felt towards you. So too to-day. Let us show plainly that we mean to stand shoulder
to shoulder (16) embattled against the Lacedaemonians; and haters enough of them--whole armies--never
fear, will be forthcoming. To prove the truth of this assertion you need only to count upon
your fingers. How many friends have they left to them to-day? The Argives have been, are, and
ever will be, hostile to them. Of course. But the Eleians? Why, the Eleians have quite lately
(17) been robbed of so much territory and so many cities that their friendship is converted
into hatred. And what shall we say of the Corinthians? the Arcadians? the Achaeans? In the
war which Sparta waged against you, there was no toil, no danger, no expense, which those peoples
did not share, in obedience to the dulcet coaxings (18) and persuasions of that power. The
Lacedaemonians gained what they wanted, and then not one fractional portion of empire, honour,
or wealth did these faithful followers come in for. That is not all. They have no scruple in
appointing their helots (19) as governors, and on the free necks of their alies, in the day
of their good fortune, they have planted the tyrant's heel.

 (17) Lit. "to-day," "nowadays."

 (18) {mala liparoumenoi}. See Thuc. i. 66 foll.; vi. 88.

 (19) See "Pol. Lac." xiv.

"Then again take the case of those whom they have detached from yourselves. In the most patent
way they have cajoled and cheated them; in place of freedom they have presented them with a
twofold slavery. The allies are tyrannised over by the governor and tyrannised over by the
ten commissioners set up by Lysander over every city. (20) And to come lastly to the great
king. In spite of all the enormous contributions with which he aided them to gain a mastery
over you, is the lord of Asia one whit better off to-day than if he had taken exactly the opposite
course and joined you in reducing them?

 (20) Grote ("H. G." ix. 323), referring to this passage, and to
    "Hell." VI. iii. 8-11, notes the change in Spartan habits between
    405 and 394 B.C. (i.e. between the victory of Aegospotami and the
    defeat of Cnidos), when Sparta possessed a large public revenue
    derived from the tribute of the dependent cities. For her earlier
    condition, 432 B.C., cf. Thuc. i. 80. For her subsequent
    condition, 334 B.C., cf. Arist. "Pol." ii. 6, 23.

"Is it not clear that you have only to step forward once again as the champions of this crowd
of sufferers from injustice, and you will attain to a pinnacle of power quite unprecedented?
In the days of your old empire you were leaders of the maritime powers merely--that is clear;
but your new empire to-day will be universal. You will have at your backs not only your former
subjects, but ourselves, and the Peloponnesians, and the king himself, with all that mighty
power which is his. We do not deny that we were serviceable allies enough to Lacedaemon, as
you will bear us witness; but this we say:--If we helped the Lacedaemonians vigorously in the
past, everything tends to show that we shall help you still more vigorously to-day; for our
swords will be unsheathed, not in behalf of islanders, or Syracusans, or men of alien stock,
as happened in the late war, but of ourselves, suffering under a sense of wrong. And there
is another important fact which you ought to realise: this selfish system of organised greed
which is Sparta's will fall more readily to pieces than your own late empire. Yours was the
proud assertion of naval empire over subjects powerless by sea. Theirs is the selfish sway
of a minority asserting dominion over states equally well armed with themselves, and many times
more numerous. Here our remarks end. Do not forget, however, men of Athens, that as far as
we can understand the matter, the field to which we invite you is destined to prove far richer
in blessings to your own state of Athens than to ours, Thebes."

With these words the speaker ended. Among the Athenians, speaker after speaker spoke in favour
of the proposition, (21) and finally a unanimous resolution was passed voting assistance to
the Thebans. Thrasybulus, in an answer communicating the resolution, pointed out with pride
that in spite of the unfortified condition of Piraeus, Athens would not shrink from repaying
her former debt of gratitude to Thebes with interest. "You," he added, "refused to join in
a campaign against us; we are prepared to fight your battles with you against the enemy, if
he attacks you." Thus the Thebans returned home and made preparations to defend themselves,
whilst the Athenians made ready to assist them.

 (21) For the alliance between Boeotia and Athens, B.C. 395, see
    Kohler, "C. I. A." ii. 6; Hicks, op. cit. 65; Lys. "pro Man." S.
    13; Jebb, "Att. Or." i. p. 247; and the two speeches of the same
    orator Lysias against Alcibiades (son of the famous Alcibiades),
    on a Charge of Desertion ("Or." xiv.), and on a Charge of Failure
    to Serve ("Or." xv.)--Jebb, op. cit. i. p. 256 foll.

And now the Lacedaemonians no longer hesitated. Pausanias the king advanced into Boeotia with
the home army and the whole of the Peloponnesian contingents, saving only the Corinthians,
who declined to serve. Lysander, at the head of the army supplied by Phocis and Orchomenus
and the other strong places in those parts, had already reached Haliartus, in front of Pausanias.
Being arrived, he refused to sit down quietly and await the arrival of the army from Lacedaemon,
but at once marched with what troops he had against the walls of Haliartus; and in the first
instance he tried to persuade the citizens to detach themselves from Thebes and to assume autonomy,
but the intention was cut short by certain Thebans within the fortress. Whereupon Lysander
attacked the place. The Thebans were made aware, (22) and hurried to the rescue with heavy
infantry and cavalry. Then, whether it was that the army of relief fell upon Lysander unawares,
or that with clear knowledge of his approach he preferred to await the enemy, with intent to
crush him, is uncertain. This only is clear: a battle was fought beside the walls, and a trophy
still exists to mark the victory of the townsfolk before the gates of Haliartus. Lysander was
slain, and the rest fled to the mountains, the Thebans hotly pursuing. But when the pursuit
had led them to some considerable height, and they were fairly environed and hemmed in by difficult
ground and narrow space, then the heavy infantry turned to bay, and greeted them with a shower
of darts and missiles. First two or three men dropped who had been foremost of the pursuers,
and then upon the rest they poured volleys of stones down the precipitous incline, and pressed
on their late pursuers with much zeal, until the Thebans turned tail and quitted the deadly
slope, leaving behind them more than a couple of hundred corpses.

 (22) See Plut. "Lys." xxviii. (Clough, iii. 137).

On this day, thereafter, the hearts of the Thebans failed them as they counted their losses
and found them equal to their gains; but the next day they discovered that during the night
the Phocians and the rest of them had made off to their several homes, whereupon they fell
to pluming themselves highly on their achievement. But presently Pausanias appeared at the
head of the Lacedaemonian army, and once more their dangers seemed to thicken round them. Deep,
we are told, was the silence and abasement which reigned in their host. It was not until the
third day, when the Athenians arrived (23) and were duely drawn up beside them, whilst Pausanias
neither attacked nor offered battle, that at length the confidence of the Thebans took a larger
range. Pausanias, on his side, having summoned his generals and commanders of fifties, (24)
deliberated whether to give battle or to content himself with picking up the bodies of Lysander
and those who fell with him, under cover of a truce.

 (23) See Dem. "On the Crown," 258.

 (24) Lit. "polemarchs and penteconters"--"colonels and lieutenants."
    See "Pol. Lac." xi.

The considerations which weighed upon the minds of Pausanias and the other high officers of
the Lacedaemonians seem to have been that Lysander was dead and his defeated army in retreat;
while, as far as they themselves were concerned, the Corinthian contingent was absolutely wanting,
and the zeal of the troops there present at the lowest ebb. They further reasoned that the
enemy's cavalry was numerous and theirs the reverse; whilst, weightiest of all, there lay the
dead right under the walls, so that if they had been ever so much stronger it would have been
no easy task to pick up the bodies within range of the towers of Haliartus. On all these grounds
they determined to ask for a flag of truce, in order to pick up the bodies of the slain. These,
however, the Thebans were not disposed to give back unless they agreed to retire from their
territory. The terms were gladly accepted by the Lacedaemonians, who at once picked up the
corpses of the slain, and prepared to quit the territory of Boeotia. The preliminaries were
transacted, and the retreat commenced. Despondent indeed was the demeanour of the Lacedaemonians,
in contrast with the insolent bearing of the Thebans, who visited the slightest attempt to
trespass on their private estates with blows and chased the offenders back on to the high roads
unflinchingly. Such was the conclusion of the campaign of the Lacedaemonians.

As for Pausanias, on his arrival at home he was tried on the capital charge. The heads of indictment
set forth that he had failed to reach Haliartus as soon as Lysander, in spite of his undertaking
to be there on the same day: that, instead of using any endeavour to pick up the bodies of
the slain by force of arms, he had asked for a flag of truce: that at an earlier date, when
he had got the popular government of Athens fairly in his grip at Piraeus, he had suffered
it to slip through his fingers and escape. Besides this, (25) he failed to present himself
at the trial, and a sentence of death was passed upon him. He escaped to Tegea and there died
of an illness whilst still in exile. Thus closes the chapter of events enacted on the soil
of Hellas. To return to Asia and Agesilaus.

 (25) Or, add, "as a further gravamen."

BOOK IV

I

B.C. 395. With the fall of the year Agesilaus reached Phrygia--the Phrygia of Pharnabazus--and
proceeded to burn and harry the district. City after city was taken, some by force and some
by voluntary surrender. To a proposal of Spithridates to lead him into Paphlagonia, (1) where
he would introduce the king of the country to him in conference and obtain his alliance, he
readily acceded. It was a long-cherished ambition of Agesilaus to alienate some one of the
subject nations from the Persian monarch, and he pushed forward eagerly.

 (1) See Hartman ("An. Xen." p. 339), who suggests {Otun auto} for {sun
    auto}.

On his arrival in Paphlagonia, King Otys (2) came, and an alliance was made. (The fact was,
he had been summoned by the king to Susa and had not gone up.) More than that, through the
persuasion of Spithridates he left behind as a parting gift to Agesilaus one thousand cavalry
and a couple of thousand peltasts. Agesilaus was anxious in some way to show his gratitude
to Spithridates for such help, and spoke as follows:--"Tell me," he said to Spithridates, "would
you not like to give your daughter to King Otys?" "Much more would I like to give her," he
answered, "than he to take her--I an outcast wanderer, and he lord of a vast territory and
forces." Nothing more was said at the time about the marriage; but when Otys was on the point
of departure and came to bid farewell, Agesilaus, having taken care that Spithridates should
be out of the way, in the presence of the Thirty broached the subject: (3) "Can you tell me,
Otys, to what sort of family Spithridates belongs?" "To one of the noblest in Persia," replied
the king. Agesilaus: "Have you observed how beautiful his son is?" Otys: "To be sure; last
evening I was supping with him." Agesilaus: "And they tell me his daughter is yet more beautiful."
Otys: "That may well be; beautiful she is." Agesilaus: "For my part, as you have proved so
good a friend to us, I should like to advise you to take this girl to wife. Not only is she
very beautiful--and what more should a husband ask for?--but her father is of noble family,
and has a force at his back large enough to retaliate on Pharnabazus for an injury. He has
made the satrap, as you see, a fugitive and a vagabond in his own vast territory. I need not
tell you," he added, "that a man who can so chastise an enemy is well able to benefit a friend;
and of this be assured: by such an alliance you will gain not the connection of Spithridates
alone, but of myself and the Lacedaemonians, and, as we are the leaders of Hellas, of the rest
of Hellas also. And what a wedding yours will be! Were ever nuptials celebrated on so grand
a scale before? Was ever bride led home by such an escort of cavalry and light-armed troops
and heavy infantry, as shall escort your wife home to your palace?" Otys asked: "Is Spithridates
of one mind with you in this proposal?" and Agesilaus answered: "In good sooth he did not bid
me make it for him. And for my own part in the matter, though it is, I admit, a rare pleasure
to requite an enemy, yet I had far rather at any time discover some good fortune for my friends."
Otys: "Why not ask if your project pleases Spithridates too?" Then Agesilaus, turning to Herippidas
and the rest of the Thirty, bade them go to Spithridates; "and give him such good instruction,"
he added, "that he shall wish what we wish." The Thirty rose and retired to administer their
lesson. But they seemed to tarry a long time, and Agesilaus asked: "What say you, King Otys--shall
we summon him hither ourselves? You, I feel certain, are better able to persuade him than the
whole Thirty put together." Thereupon Agesilaus summoned Spithridates and the others. As they
came forward, Herippidas promptly delivered himself thus: "I spare you the details, Agesilaus.
To make a long story short, Spithridates says, 'He will be glad to do whatever pleases you.'"
Then Agesilaus, turning first to one and then to the other: "What pleases me," said he, "is
that you should wed a daughter--and you a wife--so happily. (4) But," he added, "I do not see
how we can well bring home the bride by land till spring." "No, not by land," the suitor answered,
"but you might, if you chose, conduct her home at once by sea." Thereupon they exchanged pledges
to ratify the compact; and so sent Otys rejoicing on his way.

 (2) See "Ages." iii. 4, where he is called Cotys.

 (3) I.e. "Spartan counsellors."

 (4) Or, "and may the wedding be blest!"

Agesilaus, who had not failed to note the king's impatience, at once fitted out a ship of war
and gave orders to Callias, a Lacedaemonian, to escort the maiden to her new home; after which
he himself began his march on Dascylium. Here was the palace of Pharnabazus. It lay in the
midst of abundant supplies. Here, too, were most fair hunting grounds, offering the hunter
choice between enclosed parks (5) and a wide expanse of field and fell; and all around there
flowed a river full of fish of every sort; and for the sportsman versed in fowling, winged
game in abundance.

 (5) Lit. "paradises." See "Anab." I. ii. 7; "Cyrop." I. iv. 11.

In these quarters the Spartan king passed the winter, collecting supplies for the army either
on the spot or by a system of forage. On one of these occasions the troops, who had grown reckless
and scornful of the enemy through long immunity from attack, whilst engaged in collecting supplies
were scattered over the flat country, when Pharnabazus fell upon them with two scythe-chariots
and about four hundred horse. Seeing him thus advancing, the Hellenes ran together, mustering
possibly seven hundred men. The Persian did not hesitate, but placing his chariots in front,
supported by himself and the cavalry, he gave the command to charge. The scythe-chariots charged
and scattered the compact mass, and speedily the cavalry had laid low in the dust about a hundred
men, while the rest retreated hastily, under cover of Agesilaus and his hoplites, who were
fortunately near.

It was the third or fourth day after this that Spithridates made a discovery: Pharnabazus lay
encamped in Caue, a large village not more than eighteen miles (6) away. This news he lost
no time in reporting to Herippidas. The latter, who was longing for some brilliant exploit,
begged Agesilaus to furnish him with two thousand hoplites, an equal number of peltasts, and
some cavalry--the latter to consist of the horsemen of Spithridates, the Paphlagonians, and
as many Hellene troopers as he might perchance persuade to follow him. Having got the promise
of them from Agesilaus, he proceeded to take the auspices. Towards late afternoon he obtained
favourable omens and broke off the sacrifice. Thereupon he ordered the troops to get their
evening meal, after which they were to present themselves in front of the camp. But by the
time darkness had closed in, not one half of them had come out. To abandon the project was
to call down the ridicule of the rest of the Thirty. So he set out with the force to hand,
and about daylight, falling on the camp of Pharnabazus, put many of his advanced guard of Mysians
to the sword. The men themselves made good their escape in different directions, but the camp
was taken, and with it divers goblets and other gear such as a man like Pharnabazus would have,
not to speak of much baggage and many baggage animals. It was the dread of being surrounded
and besieged, if he should establish himself for long at any one spot, which induced Pharnabazus
to flee in gipsy fashion from point to point over the country, carefully obliterating his encampments.
Now as the Paphlagonians and Spithridates brought back the captured property, they were met
by Herippidas with his brigadiers and captains, who stopped them and (7) relieved them of all
they had; the object being to have as large a list as possible of captures to deliver over
to the officers who superintended the sale of booty. (8) This treatment the Asiatics found
intolerable. They deemed themselves at once injured and insulted, got their kit together in
the night, and made off in the direction of Sardis to join Ariaeus without mistrust, seeing
that he too had revolted and gone to war with the king. On Agesilaus himself no heavier blow
fell during the whole campaign than the desertion of Spithridates and Megabates and the Paphlagonians.

 (6) Lit. "one hundred and sixty stades."

 (7) Or, "captains posted to intercept them, who relieved..." See
    "Anab." IV. i. 14.

 (8) See "Pol. Lac." xiii. 11, for these officers.

Now there was a certain man of Cyzicus, Apollophanes by name; he was an old friend of Pharnabazus,
and at this time had become a friend also of Agesilaus. (9) This man informed Agesilaus that
he thought he could bring about a meeting between him and Pharnabazus, which might tend to
friendship; and having so got ear of him, he obtained pledges of good faith between his two
friends, and presented himself with Pharnabazus at the trysting-place, where Agesilaus with
the Thirty around him awaited their coming, reclined upon a grassy sward. Pharnabazus presently
arrived clad in costliest apparel; but just as his attendants were about to spread at his feet
the carpets on which the Persians delicately seat themselves, he was touched with a sense of
shame at his own luxury in sight of the simplicity of Agesilaus, and he also without further
ceremony seated himself on the bare ground. And first the two bade one another hail, and then
Pharnabazus stretched out his right hand and Agesilaus his to meet him, and the conversation
began. Pharnabazus, as the elder of the two, spoke first. "Agesilaus," he said, "and all you
Lacedaemonians here present, while you were at war with the Athenians I was your friend and
ally; it was I who furnished the wealth that made your navy strong on sea; on land I fought
on horseback by your side, and pursued your enemies into the sea. (10) As to duplicity like
that of Tissaphernes, I challenge you to accuse me of having played you false by word or deed.
Such have I ever been; and in return how am I treated by yourselves to-day?--in such sort that
I cannot even sup in my own country unless, like the wild animals, I pick up the scraps you
chance to leave. The beautiful palaces which my father left me as an heirloom, the parks (11)
full of trees and beasts of the chase in which my heart rejoiced, lie before my eyes hacked
to pieces, burnt to ashes. Maybe I do not comprehend the first principles of justice and holiness;
do you then explain to me how all this resembles the conduct of men who know how to repay a
simple debt of gratitude." He ceased, and the Thirty were ashamed before him and kept silence. (12)

    Pharnabazus (Apollonius apud Euseb. B, "Praep. Evang." p. 465)."
    See "Hist. Lit. of Anc. Gr.," Muller and Donaldson, ii. p. 380.

At length, after some pause, Agesilaus spoke. "I think you are aware," he said, "Pharnabazus,
that within the states of Hellas the folk of one community contract relations of friendship
and hospitality with one another; (13) but if these states should go to war, then each man
will side with his fatherland, and friend will find himself pitted against friend in the field
of battle, and, if it so betide, the one may even deal the other his death-blow. So too we
to-day, being at war with your sovereign lord the king, must needs regard as our enemy all
that he calls his; not but that with yourself personally we should esteem it our high fortune
to be friends. If indeed it were merely an exchange of service--were you asked to give up your
lord the king and to take us as your masters in his stead, I could not so advise you; but the
fact is, by joining with us it is in your power to-day to bow your head to no man, to call
no man master, to reap the produce of your own domain in freedom--freedom, which to my mind
is more precious than all riches. Not that we bid you to become a beggar for the sake of freedom,
but rather to use our friendship to increase not the king's authority, but your own, by subduing
those who are your fellow-slaves to-day, and who to-morrow shall be your willing subjects.
Well, then, freedom given and wealth added--what more would you desire to fill the cup of happiness
to overflowing?" Pharnabazus replied: "Shall I tell you plainly what I will do?" "That were
but kind and courteous on your part," he answered. "Thus it stands with me, then," said Pharnabazus.
"If the king should send another general, and if he should wish to rank me under this new man's
orders, I, for my part, am willing to accept your friendship and alliance; but if he offers
me the supreme command--why, then, I plainly tell you, there is a certain something in the
very name ambition which whispers me that I shall war against you to the best of my ability."
(14) When he heard that, Agesilaus seized the satrap's hand, exclaiming: "Ah, best of mortals,
may the day arrive which sends us such a friend! Of one thing rest assured. This instant I
leave your territory with what haste I may, and for the future--even in case of war--as long
as we can find foes elsewhere our hands shall hold aloof from you and yours."

 (13) Or, add, "we call them guest friends."

 (14) Or, "so subtle a force, it seems, is the love of honour that."
    Grote, "H. G." ix. 386; cf. Herod. iii. 57 for "ambition,"
    {philotimia}.

And with these words he broke up the meeting. Pharnabazus mounted his horse and rode away,
but his son by Parapita, who was still in the bloom of youth, lingered behind; then, running
up to Agesilaus, he exclaimed: "See, I choose you as my friend." "And I accept you," replied
the king. "Remember, then," the lad answered, and with the word presented the beautiful javelin
in his hand to Agesilaus, who received it, and unclasping a splendid trapping (15) which his
secretary, Idaeus, had round the neck of his charger, he gave it in return to the youth; whereupon
the boy leapt on his horse's back and galloped after his father. (16) At a later date, during
the absence of Pharnabazus abroad, this same youth, the son of Parapita, was deprived of the
government by his brother and driven into exile. Then Agesilaus took great interest in him,
and as he had a strong attachment to the son of Eualces, an Athenian, Agesilaus did all he
could to have this friend of his, who was the tallest of the boys, admitted to the two hundred
yards race at Olympia.

B.C. 394. But to return to the actual moment. Agesilaus was as good as his word, and at once
marched out of the territory of Pharnabazus. The season verged on spring. Reaching the plain
of Thebe, (17) he encamped in the neighbourhood of the temple of Artemis of Astyra, (18) and
there employed himself in collecting troops from every side, in addition to those which he
already had, so as to form a complete armament. These preparations were pressed forward with
a view to penetrating as far as possible into the interior. He was persuaded that every tribe
or nation placed in his rear might be considered as alienated from the king.

Such were the concerns and projects of Agesilaus. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians at home were
quite alive to the fact that moneys had been sent into Hellas, and that the bigger states were
leagued together to declare war against them. It was hard to avoid the conclusion that Sparta
herself was in actual danger, and that a campaign was inevitable. While busy, therefore, with
preparations themselves, they lost no time in despatching Epicydidas to fetch Agesilaus. That
officer, on his arrival, explained the position of affairs, and concluded by delivering a peremptory
summons of the state recalling him to the assistance of the fatherland without delay. The announcement
could not but come as a grievous blow to Agesilaus, as he reflected on the vanished hopes,
and the honours plucked from his grasp. Still, he summoned the allies and announced to them
the contents of the despatch from home. "To aid our fatherland," he added, "is an imperative
duty. If, however, matters turn out well on the other side, rely upon it, friends and allies,
I will not forget you, but I shall be back anon to carry out your wishes." When they heard
the announcement many wept, and they passed a resolution, one and all, to assist Agesilaus
in assisting Lacedaemon; if matters turned out well there, they undertook to take him as their
leader and come back again to Asia; and so they fell to making preparations to follow him.

Agesilaus, on his side, determined to leave behind him in Asia Euxenus as governor, and with
him a garrison numbering no less than four thousand troops, which would enable him to protect
the states in Asia. But for himself, as on the one hand he could see that the majority of the
soldiers would far rather stay behind than undertake service against fellow-Hellenes, and on
the other hand he wished to take as fine and large an army with him as he could, he offered
prizes first to that state or city which should continue the best corps of troops, and secondly
to that captain of mercenaries who should join the expedition with the best equipped battalion
of heavy infantry, archers, and light infantry. On the same principle he informed the chief
cavalry officers that the general who succeeded in presenting the best accoutred and best mounted
regiment would receive from himself some victorious distinction. "The final adjudication,"
he said, "would not be made until they had crossed from Asia into Europe and had reached the
Chersonese; and this with a view to impress upon them that the prizes were not for show but
for real campaigners." (1) These consisted for the most part of infantry or cavalry arms and
accoutrements tastefully furnished, besides which there were chaplets of gold. The whole, useful
and ornamental alike, must have cost nearly a thousand pounds, (2) but as the result of this
outlay, no doubt, arms of great value were procured for the expedition. (3) When the Hellespont
was crossed the judges were appointed. The Lacedaemonians were represented by Menascus, Herippidas,
and Orsippus, and the allies by one member from each state. As soon as the adjudication was
complete, the army commenced its march with Agesilaus at its head, following the very route
taken by the great king when he invaded Hellas.

 (1) Or, "that the perfection of equipment was regarded as anticipative
    of actual service in the field." Cobet suggests for {eukrinein}
    {dieukrinein}; cf. "Oecon." viii. 6.

 (2) Lit. "at least four talents" = 975 pounds.

 (3) Or, "beyond which, the arms and material to equip the expedition
    were no doubt highly costly."

Meanwhile the ephors had called out the ban, and as Agesipolis was still a boy, the state called
upon Aristodemus, who was of the royal family and guardian of the young king, to lead the expedition;
and now that the Lacedaemonians were ready to take the field and the forces of their opponents
were duly mustered, the latter met (4) to consider the most advantageous method of doing battle.

 (4) At Corinth. See above, III. iv. 11; below, V. iv. 61, where the
    victory of Nixos is described but not localised.

Timolaus of Corinth spoke: "Soldiers of the allied forces," he said, "the growth of Lacedaemon
seems to me just like that of some mighty river--at its sources small and easily crossed, but
as it farther and farther advances, other rivers discharge themselves into its channel, and
its stream grows ever more formidable. So is it with the Lacedaemonians. Take them at the starting-point
and they are but a single community, but as they advance and attach city after city they grow
more numerous and more resistless. I observe that when people wish to take wasps' nests--if
they try to capture the creatures on the wing, they are liable to be attacked by half the hive;
whereas, if they apply fire to them ere they leave their homes, they will master them without
scathe themselves. On this principle I think it best to bring about the battle within the hive
itself, or, short of that, as close to Lacedaemon as possible." (5)

 (5) Or, "if not actually at Lacedaemon, then at least as near as
    possible to the hornet's nest."

The arguments of the speaker were deemed sound, and a resolution was passed in that sense;
but before it could be carried out there were various arrangements to be made. There was the
question of headship. Then, again, what was the proper depth of line to be given to the different
army corps? for if any particular state or states gave too great a depth to their battle line
they would enable the enemy to turn their flank. Whilst they were debating these points, the
Lacedaemonians had incorporated the men of Tegea and the men of Mantinea, and were ready to
debouch into the bimarine region. (6) And as the two armies advanced almost at the same time,
the Corinthians and the rest reached the Nemea, (7) and the Lacedaemonians and their allies
occupied Sicyon. The Lacedaemonians entered by Epieiceia, and at first were severely handled
by the light-armed troops of the enemy, who discharged stones and arrows from the vantage-ground
on their right; but as they dropped down upon the Gulf of Corinth they advanced steadily onwards
through the flat country, felling timber and burning the fair land. Their rivals, on their
side, after a certain forward movement, (8) paused and encamped, placing the ravine in front
of them; but still the Lacedaemonians advanced, and it was only when they were within ten furlongs
(9) of the hostile position that they followed suit and encamped, and then they remained quiet.

 (6) I.e. "the shores of the Corinthian Gulf." Or, "upon the strand or
    coast road or coast land of Achaia"  (aliter {ten aigialon}(?) the
    Strand of the Corinthian Gulf, the old name of this part of
    Achaia).

 (7) Or, "the district of Nemea."

 (8) {epelthontes}, but see Grote ("H. G." ix. 425 note), who prefers
    {apelthontes} = retreated and encamped.

 (9) Lit. "ten stades." For the numbers below, see Grote, "H. G." ix.
    422, note 1.

And here I may state the numbers on either side. The Lacedaemonian heavy-armed infantry levies
amounted to six thousand men. Of Eleians, Triphylians, Acroreians, and Lasionians, there must
have been nearly three thousand, with fifteen hundred Sicyonians, while Epidaurus, Troezen,
Hermione, and Halieis (10) contributed at least another three thousand. To these heavy infantry
troops must be added six hundred Lacedaemonian cavalry, a body of Cretan archers about three
hundred strong, besides another force of slingers, at least four hundred in all, consisting
of Marganians, Letrinians, and Amphidolians. The men of Phlius were not represented. Their
plea was they were keeping "holy truce." That was the total of the forces on the Lacedaemonian
side. There was collected on the enemy's side six thousand Athenian heavy infantry, with about,
as was stated, seven thousand Argives, and in the absence of the men of Orchomenus something
like five thousand Boeotians. There were besides three thousand Corinthians, and again from
the whole of Euboea at least three thousand. These formed the heavy infantry. Of cavalry the
Boeotians, again in the absence of the Orchomenians, furnished eight hundred, the Athenians
(11) six hundred, the Chalcidians of Euboea one hundred, the Opuntian Locrians (12) fifty.
Their light troops, including those of the Corinthians, were more numerous, as the Ozolian
Locrians, the Melians, and Arcarnanians (13) helped to swell their numbers.

 (10) Halieis, a seafaring people (Strabo, viii. 373) and town on the
    coast of Hermionis; Herod. vii. 137; Thuc. i. 105, ii. 56, iv. 45;
    Diod. xi. 78; "Hell." VI. ii. 3.

 (11) For a treaty between Athens and Eretria, B.C. 395, see Hicks, 66;
    and below, "Hell." IV. iii. 15; Hicks, 68, 69; Diod. xiv. 82.

 (12) See above, "Hell." III. v. 3.

 (13) See below, "Hell." IV. vi. 1; ib. vii. 1; VI. v. 23.

Such was the strength of the two armies. The Boeotians, as long as they occupied the left wing,
showed no anxiety to join battle, but after a rearrangement which gave them the right, placing
the Athenians opposite the Lacedaemonians, and themselves opposite the Achaeans, at once, we
are told, (14) the victims proved favourable, and the order was passed along the lines to prepare
for immediate action. The Boeotians, in the first place, abandoning the rule of sixteen deep,
chose to give their division the fullest possible depth, and, moreover, kept veering more and
more to their right, with the intention of overlapping their opponent's flank. The consequence
was that the Athenians, to avoid being absolutely severed, were forced to follow suit, and
edged towards the right, though they recognised the risk they ran of having their flank turned.
For a while the Lacedaemonians had no idea of the advance of the enemy, owing to the rough
nature of the ground, (15) but the notes of the paean at length announced to them the fact,
and without an instant's delay the answering order "prepare for battle" ran along the different
sections of their army. As soon as their troops were drawn up, according to the tactical disposition
of the various generals of foreign brigades, the order was passed to "follow the lead," and
then the Lacedaemonians on their side also began edging to their right, and eventually stretched
out their wing so far that only six out of the ten regimental divisions of the Athenians confronted
the Lacedaemonians, the other four finding themselves face to face with the men of Tegea. And
now when they were less than a furlong (16) apart, the Lacedaemonians sacrificed in customary
fashion a kid to the huntress goddess, (17) and advanced upon their opponents, wheeling round
their overlapping columns to outflank his left. As the two armies closed, the allies of Lacedaemon
were as a rule fairly borne down by their opponents. The men of Pellene alone, steadily confronting
the Thespiaeans, held their ground, and the dead of either side strewed the position. (18)
As to the Lacedaemonians themselves: crushing that portion of the Athenian troops which lay
immediately in front of them, and at the same time encircling them with their overlapping right,
they slew man after man of them; and, absolutely unscathed themselves, their unbroken columns
continued their march, and so passed behind the four remaining divisions (19) of the Athenians
before these latter had returned from their own victorious pursuit. Whereby the four divisions
in question also emerged from battle intact, except for the casualties inflicted by the Tegeans
in the first clash of the engagement. The troops next encountered by the Lacedaemonians were
the Argives retiring. These they fell foul of, and the senior polemarch was just on the point
of closing with them "breast to breast" when some one, it is said, shouted, "Let their front
ranks pass." This was done, and as the Argives raced past, their enemies thrust at their unprotected
(20) sides and killed many of them. The Corinthians were caught in the same way as they retired,
and when their turn had passed, once more the Lacedaemonians lit upon a portion of the Theban
division retiring from the pursuit, and strewed the field with their dead. The end of it all
was that the defeated troops in the first instance made for safety to the walls of their city,
but the Corinthians within closed the gates, whereupon the troops took up quarters once again
in their old encampment. The Lacedaemonians on their side withdrew to the point at which they
first closed with the enemy, and there set up a trophy of victory. So the battle ended.

    proved favourable."

Meanwhile Agesilaus was rapidly hastening with his reinforcements from Asia. He had reached
Amphipolis when Dercylidas brought the news of this fresh victory of the Lacedaemonians; their
own loss had been eight men, that of the enemy considerable. It was his business at the same
time to explain that not a few of the allies had fallen also. Agesilaus asked, "Would it not
be opportune, Dercylidas, if the cities that have furnished us with contingents could hear
of this victory as soon as possible?" And Dercylidas replied: "The news at any rate is likely
to put them in better heart." Then said the king: "As you were an eye-witness there could hardly
be a better bearer of the news than yourself." To this proposal Dercylidas lent a willing ear--to
travel abroad (1) was his special delight--and he replied, "Yes, under your orders." "Then
you have my orders," the king said. "And you may further inform the states from myself that
we have not forgotten our promise; if all goes well over here we shall be with them again ere
long." So Dercylidas set off on his travels, in the first instance to the Hellespont; (2) while
Agesilaus crossed Macedonia, and arrived in Thessaly. And now the men of Larissa, Crannon,
Scotussa, and Pharsalus, who were allies of the Boeotians--and in fact all the Thessalians
except the exiles for the time being--hung on his heels (3) and did him damage.

 (1) See "Pol. Lac." xiv. 4.

 (2) See below, "Hell." IV. viii. 3.

 (3) See "Ages." ii. 2; Grote, "H. G." ix. 420, note 2.

For some while he marched his troops in a hollow square, (4) posting half his cavalry in front
and half on his rear; but finding that the Thessalians checked his passage by repeated charges
from behind, he strengthened his rearguard by sending round the cavalry from his van, with
the exception of his own personal escort. (5) The two armies stood confronted in battle order;
but the Thessalians, not liking the notion of a cavalry engagement with heavy infantry, turned,
and step by step retreated, while the others followed them with considerable caution. Agesilaus,
perceiving the error under which both alike laboured, now sent his own personal guard of stalwart
troopers with orders that both they and the rest of the horsemen should charge at full gallop,
(6) and not give the enemy the chance to recoil. The Thessalians were taken aback by this unexpected
onslaught, and half of them never thought of wheeling about, whilst those who did essay to
do so presented the flanks of their horses to the charge, (7) and were made prisoners. Still
Polymarchus of Pharsalus, the general in command of their cavalry, rallied his men for an instant,
and fell, sword in hand, with his immediate followers. This was the signal for a flight so
precipitate on the part of the Thessalians, that their dead and dying lined the road, and prisoners
were taken; nor was any halt made until they reached Mount Narthacius. Here, then, midway between
Pras and Narthacius, Agesilaus set up a trophy, halting for the moment, in unfeigned satisfaction
at the exploit. It was from antagonists who prided themselves on their cavalry beyond everything
that he had wrested victory, with a body of cavalry of his own mustering. Next day he crossed
the mountains of Achaea Phthiotis, and for the future continued his march through friendly
territory until he reached the confines of Boeotia.

 (7) See "Horsemanship," vii. 16; Polyb. iv. 8.

Here, at the entrance of that territory, the sun (in partial eclipse) (8) seemed to appear
in a crescent shape, and the news reached him of the defeat of the Lacedaemonians in a naval
engagement, and the death of the admiral Peisander. Details of the disaster were not wanting.
The engagement of the hostile fleets took place off Cnidus. Pharnabazus, the Persian admiral,
was present with the Phoenician fleet, and in front of him were ranged the ships of the Hellenic
squadron under Conon. Peisander had ventured to draw out his squadron to meet the combined
fleets, though the numerical inferiority of his fleet to that of the Hellenic navy under Conon
was conspicuous, and he had the mortification of seeing the allies who formed his left wing
take to flight immediately. He himself came to close quarters with the enemy, and was driven
on shore, on board his trireme, under pressure of the hostile rams. The rest, as many as were
driven to shore, deserted their ships and sought safety as best they could in the territory
of Cnidus. The admiral alone stuck to his ship, and fell sword in hand.

 (8) B.C. 394, August 14.

It was impossible for Agesilaus not to feel depressed by those tidings at first; on further
reflection, however, it seemed to him that the moral quality of more than half his troops well
entitled them to share in the sunshine of success, but in the day of trouble, when things looked
black, he was not bound to take them into his confidence. Accordingly he turned round and gave
out that he had received news that Peisander was dead, but that he had fallen in the arms of
victory in a sea-fight; and suiting his action to the word, he proceeded to offer sacrifice
in return for good tidings, (9) distributing portions of the victims to a large number of recipients.
So it befell that in the first skirmish with the enemy the troops of Agesilaus gained the upper
hand, in consequence of the report that the Lacedaemonians had won a victory by sea.

 (9) "Splendide mendax." For the ethics of the matter, see "Mem." IV.
    ii. 17; "Cyrop." I. vi. 31.

To confront Agesilaus stood an army composed of the Boeotians, Athenians, Argives, Corinthians,
Aenianians, Euboeans, and both divisions of the Locrians. Agesilaus on his side had with him
a division (10) of Lacedaemonians, which had crossed from Corinth, also half the division from
Orchomenus; besides which there were the neodamodes (11) from Lacedaemon, on service with him
already; and in addition to these the foreign contingent under Herippidas; (12) and again the
quota furnished by the Hellenic cities in Asia, with others from the cities in Europe which
he had brought over during his progress; and lastly, there were additional levies from the
spot--Orchomenian and Phocian heavy infantry. In light-armed troops, it must be admitted, the
numbers told heavily in favour of Agesilaus, but the cavalry (13) on both sides were fairly
balanced.

 (10) Lit. "a mora"; for the numbers, see "Ages." ii. 6; Plut. "Ages."
    17; Grote, "H. G." ix. 433.

 (12) See "Ages." ii. 10, 11; and above, "Hell." III. iv. 20.

 (13) See Hicks, op. cit. 68.

Such were the forces of either party. I will describe the battle itself, if only on account
of certain features which distinguish it from the battles of our time. The two armies met on
the plain of Coronea--the troops of Agesilaus advancing from the Cephisus, the Thebans and
their allies from the slopes of Helicon. Agesilaus commanded his own right in person, with
the men of Orchomenus on his extreme left. The Thebans formed their own right, while the Argives
held their left. As they drew together, for a while deep silence reigned on either side; but
when they were not more than a furlong (14) apart, with the loud hurrah (15) the Thebans, quickening
to a run, rushed furiously (16) to close quarters; and now there was barely a hundred yards
(17) breadth between the two armies, when Herippidas with his foreign brigade, and with them
the Ionians, Aeolians, and Hellespontines, darted out from the Spartans' battle-lines to greet
their onset. One and all of the above played their part in the first rush forward; in another
instant they were (18) within spear-thrust of the enemy, and had routed the section immediately
before them. As to the Argives, they actually declined to receive the attack of Agesilaus,
and betook themselves in flight to Helicon. At this moment some of the foreign division were
already in the act of crowning Agesilaus with the wreath of victory, when some one brought
him word that the Thebans had cut through the Orchomenians and were in among the baggage train.
At this the Spartan general immediately turned his army right about and advanced against them.
The Thebans, on their side, catching sight of their allies withdrawn in flight to the base
of the Helicon, and anxious to get across to their own friends, formed in close order and tramped
forward stoutly.

 (14) Lit. "a stade."

 (15) Lit. "Alalah."

 (16) Like a tornado.

 (17) Lit. "about three plethra."

 (18) Or, "All these made up the attacking columns... and coming
    within... routed..."

At this point no one will dispute the valour of Agesilaus, but he certainly did not choose
the safest course. It was open to him to make way for the enemy to pass, which done, he might
have hung upon his heels and mastered his rear. This, however, he refused to do, preferring
to crash full front against the Thebans. Thereupon, with close interlock of shield wedged in
with shield, they shoved, they fought, they dealt death, (19) they breathed out life, till
at last a portion of the Thebans broke their way through towards Helicon, but paid for that
departure by the loss of many lives. And now the victory of Agesilaus was fairly won, and he
himself, wounded, had been carried back to the main line, when a party of horse came galloping
up to tell him that something like eighty of the enemy, under arms, were sheltering under the
temple, and they asked what they ought to do. Agesilaus, though he was covered with wounds,
did not, for all that, forget his duty to God. He gave orders to let them retire unscathed,
and would not suffer any injury to be done to them. And now, seeing it was already late, they
took their suppers and retired to rest.

 (19) Or, "they slew, they were slain." In illustration of this famous
    passage, twice again worked up in "Ages." ii. 12, and "Cyrop."

But with the morning Gylis the polemarch received orders to draw up the troops in battle order,
and to set up a trophy, every man crowned with a wreath in honour of the god, and all the pipers
piping. Thus they busied themselves in the Spartan camp. On their side the Thebans sent heralds
asking to bury their dead, under a truce; and in this wise a truce was made. Agesilaus withdrew
to Delphi, where on arrival he offered to the god a tithe of the produce of his spoils--no
less than a hundred talents. (20) Gylis the polemarch meanwhile withdrew into Phocis at the
head of his troops, and from that district made a hostile advance into Locris. Here nearly
a whole day was spent by the men in freely helping themselves to goods and chattels out of
the villages and pillaging the corn; (21) but as it drew towards evening the troops began to
retire, with the Lacedaemonians in the rear. The Locrians hung upon their heels with a heavy
pelt of stones and javelins. Thereupon the Lacedaemonians turned short round and gave chase,
laying some of their assailants low. Then the Locrians ceased clinging to their rear, but continued
their volleys from the vantage-ground above. The Lacedaemonians again made efforts to pursue
their persistent foes even up the slope. At last darkness descended on them, and as they retired
man after man dropped, succumbing to the sheer difficulty of the ground; some in their inability
to see what lay in front, or else shot down by the enemy's missiles. It was then that Gylis
the polemarch met his end, as also Pelles, who was on his personal staff, and the whole of
the Spartans present without exception--eighteen or thereabouts--perished, either crushed by
stones or succumbing to other wounds. Indeed, except for timely aid brought from the camp where
the men were supping, the chances are that not a man would have escaped to tell the tale.

 (21) Or, "not to speak of provisions."

This incident ended the campaign. The army as a whole was disbanded, the contingents retiring
to their several cities, and Agesilaus home across the Gulf by sea.

B.C. 393. Subsequently (1) the war between the two parties recommenced. The Athenians, Boeotians,
Argives, and the other allies made Corinth the base of their operations; the Lacedaemonians
and their allies held Sicyon as theirs. As to the Corinthians, they had to face the fact that,
owing to their proximity to the seat of war, it was their territory which was ravaged and their
people who perished, while the rest of the allies abode in peace and reaped the fruits of their
lands in due season. Hence the majority of them, including the better class, desired peace,
and gathering into knots they indoctrinated one another with these views.

 (1) B.C. 393. See Grote, ix. p. 455, note 2 foll.; "Hell." IV. viii.
    7.

B.C. 392. (2) On the other hand, it could hardly escape the notice of the allied powers, the
Argives, Athenians, and Boeotians, as also those of the Corinthians themselves who had received
a share of the king's moneys, or for whatever reason were most directly interested in the war,
that if they did not promptly put the peace party out of the way, ten chances to one the old
laconising policy would again hold the field. It seemed there was nothing for it but the remedy
of the knife. There was a refinement of wickedness in the plan adopted. With most people the
life even of a legally condemned criminal is held sacred during a solemn season, but these
men deliberately selected the last day of the Eucleia, (3) when they might reckon on capturing
more victims in the crowded market-place, for their murderous purposes. Their agents were supplied
with the names of those to be gotten rid of, the signal was given, and then, drawing their
daggers, they fell to work. Here a man was struck down standing in the centre of a group of
talkers, and there another seated; a third while peacably enjoying himself at the play; a fourth
actually whilst officiating as a judge at some dramatic contest. (4) When what was taking place
became known, there was a general flight on the part of the better classes. Some fled to the
images of the gods in the market-place, others to the altars; and here these unhallowed miscreants,
ringleaders and followers alike, utterly regardless of duty and law, fell to butchering their
victims even within the sacred precincts of the gods; so that even some of those against whom
no hand was lifted--honest, law-abiding folk--were filled with sore amazement at sight of such
impiety. In this way many of the elder citizens, as mustering more thickly in the market-place,
were done to death. The younger men, acting on a suspicion conceived by one of their number,
Pasimelus, as to what was going to take place, kept quiet in the Kraneion; (5) but hearing
screams and shouting and being joined anon by some who had escaped from the affair, they took
the hint, and, running up along the slope of the Acrocorinthus, succeeded in repelling an attack
of the Argives and the rest. While they were still deliberating what they ought to do, down
fell a capital from its column--without assignable cause, whether of earthquake or wind. Also,
when they sacrificed, the aspect of the victims was such that the soothsayers said it was better
to descend from that position.

 (5) See Paus. II. ii. 4.

So they retired, in the first instance prepared to go into exile beyond the territory of Corinth.
It was only upon the persuasion of their friends and the earnest entreaties of their mothers
and sisters who came out to them, supported by the solemn assurance of the men in power themselves,
who swore to guarantee them against evil consequences, that some of them finally consented
to return home. Presented to their eyes was the spectacle of a tyranny in full exercise, and
to their minds the consciousness of the obliteration of their city, seeing that boundaries
were plucked up and the land of their fathers had come to be re-entitled by the name of Argos
instead of Corinth; and furthermore, compulsion was put upon them to share in the constitution
in vogue at Argos, for which they had little appetite, while in their own city they wielded
less power than the resident aliens. So that a party sprang up among them whose creed was,
that life was not worth living on such terms: their endeavour must be to make their fatherland
once more the Corinth of old days--to restore freedom to their city, purified from the murderer
and his pollution and fairly rooted in good order and legality. (6) It was a design worth the
venture: if they succeeded they would become the saviours of their country; if not--why, in
the effort to grasp the fairest flower of happiness, they would but overreach, and find instead
a glorious termination to existence.

It was in furtherance of this design that two men--Pasimelus and Alcimenes--undertook to creep
through a watercourse and effect a meeting with Praxitas the polemarch of the Lacedaemonians,
who was on garrison duty with his own division in Sicyon. They told him they could give him
ingress at a point in the long walls leading to Lechaeum. Praxitas, knowing from previous experience
that the two men might be relied upon, believed their statement; and having arranged for the
further detention in Sicyon of the division which was on the point of departure, he busied
himself with plans for the enterprise. When the two men, partly by chance and partly by contrivance,
came to be on guard at the gate where the tophy now stands, without further ado Praxitas presented
himself with his division, taking with him also the men of Sicyon and the whole of the Corinthian
exiles. (7) Having reached the gate, he had a qualm of misgiving, and hesitated to step inside
until he had first sent in a man on whom he could rely to take a look at things within. The
two Corinthians introduced him, and made so simple and straightforward a representation (8)
that the visitor was convinced, and reported everything as free of pitfalls as the two had
asserted. Then the polemarch entered, but owing to the wide space between the double walls,
as soon as they came to form in line within, the intruders were impressed by the paucity of
their numbers. They therefore erected a stockade, and dug as good a trench as they could in
front of them, pending the arrival of reinforcements from the allies. In their rear, moreover,
lay the guard of the Boeotians in the harbour. Thus they passed the whole day which followed
the night of ingress without striking a blow.

 (8) Or, "showed him the place in so straightforward a manner."

On the next day, however, the Argive troops arrived in all haste, hurrying to the rescue, and
found the enemy duly drawn up. The Lacedaemonians were on their own right, the men of Sicyon
next, and leaning against the eastern wall the Corinthian exiles, one hundred and fifty strong.
(9) Their opponents marshalled their lines face to face in correspondence: Iphicrates with
his mercenaries abutting on the eastern wall; next to them the Argives, whilst the Corinthians
of the city held their left. In the pride inspired by numbers they began advancing at once.
They overpowered the Sicyonians, and tearing asunder the stockade, pursued them to the sea
and here slew numbers of them. At that instant Pasimachus, the cavalry general, at the head
of a handful of troopers, seeing the Sicyonians sore presed, made fast the horses of his troops
to the trees, and relieving the Sicyonians of their heavy infantry shields, advanced with his
volunteers against the Argives. The latter, seeing the Sigmas on the shields and taking them
to be "Sicyonians," had not the slightest fear. Whereupon, as the story goes, Pasimachus, exclaiming
in his broad Doric, "By the twin gods! these Sigmas will cheat you, you Argives," came to close
quarters, and in that battle of a handful against a host, was slain himself with all his followers.
In another quarter of the field, however, the Corinthian exiles had got the better of their
opponents and worked their way up, so that they were now touching the city circumvallation walls.

 (9) See Grote, ix. p. 333 foll.

The Lacedaemonians, on their side, perceiving the discomfiture of the Sicyonians, sprang out
with timely aid, keeping the palisade-work on their left. But the Argives, discovering that
the Lacedaemonians were behind them, wheeled round and came racing back, pouring out of the
palisade at full speed. Their extreme right, with unprotected flanks exposed, fell victims
to the Lacedaemonians; the rest, hugging the wall, made good their retreat in dense masses
towards the city. Here they encountered the Corinthian exiles, and discovering that they had
fallen upon foes, swerved aside in the reverse direction. In this predicament some mounted
by the ladders of the city wall, and, leaping down from its summit, were destroyed; (10) others
yielded up their lives, thrust through, as they jostled at the foot of the steps; others again
were literally trampled under one another's feet and suffocated.

 (10) Or, "plunged from its summit into perdition." See Thuc. ii. 4.

The Lacedaemonians had no difficulty in the choice of victims; for at that instant a work was
assigned to them to do, (11) such as they could hardly have hoped or prayed for. To find delivered
into their hands a mob of helpless enemies, in an ecstasy of terror, presenting their unarmed
sides in such sort that none turned to defend himself, but each victim rather seemed to contribute
what he could towards his own destruction--if that was not divine interposition, I know now
what to call it. Miracle or not, in that little space so many fell, and the corpses lay piled
so thick, that eyes familiar with the stacking of corn or wood or piles of stones were called
upon to gaze at layers of human bodies. Nor did the guard of the Boeotians in the port itself
(12) escape death; some were slain upon the ramparts, others on the roofs of the dock-houses,
which they had scaled for refuge. Nothing remained but for the Corinthians and Argives to carry
away their dead under cover of a truce; whilst the allies of Lacedaemon poured in their reinforcements.
When these were collected, Praxitas decided in the first place to raze enough of the walls
to allow a free broadway for an army on march. This done, he put himself at the head of his
troops and advanced on the road to Megara, taking by assault, first Sidus and next Crommyon.
Leaving garrisons in these two fortresses, he retraced his steps, and finally fortifying Epieiceia
as a garrison outpost to protect the territory of the allies, he at once disbanded his troops
and himself withdrew to Lacedaemon.

 (11) Or, "Heaven assigned to them a work..." Lit. "The God..."

 (12) I.e. "of Lechaeum."

B.C. 392-391. (13) After this the great armaments of both belligerents had ceased to exist.
The states merely furnished garrisons--the one set at Corinth, the other set at Sicyon--and
were content to guard the walls. Though even so, a vigorous war was carried on by dint of the
mercenary troops with which both sides were furnished.

 (13) So Grote and Curtius; al. B.C. 393.

A signal incident in the period was the invasion of Phlius by Iphicrates. He laid an ambuscade,
and with a small body of troops adopting a system of guerilla war, took occasion of an unguarded
sally of the citizens of Phlius to inflict such losses on them, that though they had never
previously received the Lacedaemonians within their walls, they received them now. They had
hitherto feared to do so lest it might lead to the restoration of the banished members of their
community, who gave out that they owed their exile to their Lacedaemonian sympathies; (14)
but they were now in such abject fear of the Corinthian party that they sent to fetch the Lacedaemonians,
and delivered the city and citadel to their safe keeping. These latter, however, well disposed
to the exiles of Phlius, did not, at the time they held the city, so much as breathe the thought
of bringing back the exiles; on the contrary, as soon as the city seemed to have recovered
its confidence, they took their departure, leaving city and laws precisely as they had found
them on their entry.

 (14) Lit. "laconism."

To return to Iphicrates and his men: they frequently extended their incursions even into Arcadia
in many directions, (15) following their usual guerilla tactics, but also making assaults on
fortified posts. The heavy infantry of the Arcadians positively refused to face them in the
field, so profound was the terror in which they held these light troops. In compensation, the
light troops themselves entertained a wholesome dread of the Lacedaemonians, and did not venture
to approach even within javelin-range of their heavy infantry. They had been taught a lesson
when, within that distance, some of the younger hoplites had made a dash at them, catching
and putting some of them to the sword. But however profound the contempt of the Lacedaemonians
for these light troops, their contempt for their own allies was deeper. (On one occasion (16)
a reinforcement of Mantineans had sallied from the walls between Corinth and Lechaeum to engage
the peltasts, and had no sooner come under attack than they swerved, losing some of their men
as they made good their retreat. The Lacedaemonians were unkind enough to poke fun at these
unfortunates. "Our allies," they said, "stand in as much awe of these peltasts as children
of the bogies and hobgoblins of their nurses." For themselves, starting from Lechaeum, they
found no difficulty in marching right round the city of Corinth with a single Lacedaemonian
division and the Corinthian exiles.) (17)

 (15) See Thuc. ii. 4.

 (16) See Grote, ix. 472 note. Lechaeum was not taken by the
    Lacedaemonians until the Corinthian long walls had been rebuilt by
    the Athenians. Possibly the incidents in this section (S. 17)
    occurred after the capture of Lechaeum. The historian introduces
    them parenthetically, as it were, in illustration of his main
    topic--the success of the peltasts.

 (17) Or, adopting Schneider's conjecture, {estratopedeuonto}, add "and
    encamping."

The Athenians, on their side, who felt the power of the Lacedaemonians to be dangerously close,
now that the walls of Corinth had been laid open, and even apprehended a direct attack upon
themselves, determined to rebuild the portion of the wall severed by Praxitas. Accordingly
they set out with their whole force, including a suite of stonelayers, masons, and carpenters,
and within a few days erected a quite splendid wall on the side facing Sicyon towards the west,
(18) and then proceeded with more leisure to the completion of the eastern portion.

 (18) See Thuc. vi. 98.

To turn once more to the other side: the Lacedaemonians, indignant at the notion that the Argives
should be gathering the produce of their lands in peace at home, as if war were a pastime,
marched against them. Agesilaus commanded the expedition, and after ravaging their territory
from one end to the other, crossed their frontier at Tenea (19) and swooped down upon Corinth,
taking the walls which had been lately rebuilt by the Athenians. He was supported on the sea
side by his brother Teleutias (20) with a naval force of about twelve triremes, and the mother
of both was able to congratulate herself on the joint success of both her sons; one having
captured the enemy's walls by land and the other his ships and naval arsenal by sea, on the
same day. These achievements sufficed Agesilaus for the present; he disbanded the army of the
allies and led the state troops home.

B.C. 390. (1) Subsequently the Lacedaemonians made a second expedition against Corinth. They
heard from the exiles that the citizens contrived to preserve all their cattle in Peiraeum;
indeed, large numbers derived their subsistence from the place. Agesilaus was again in command
of the expedition. In the first instance he advanced upon the Isthmus. It was the month of
the Isthmian games, (2) and here he found the Argives engaged in conducting the sacrifice to
Poseidon, as if Corinth were Argos. So when they perceived the approach of Agesilaus, the Argives
and their friends left the offerings as they lay, including the preparations for the breakfast,
and retired with undisguised alarm into the city by the Cenchrean road. (3) Agesilaus, though
he observed the movement, refrained from giving chase, but taking up his quarters in the temple,
there proceeded to offer victims to the god himself, and waited until the Corinthian exiles
had celebrated the sacrifice to Poseidon, along with the games. But no sooner had Agesilaus
turned his back and retired, than the Argives returned and celebrated the Isthmian games afresh;
so that in this particular year there were cases in which the same competitors were twice defeated
in this or that contest, or conversely, the same man was proclaimed victor twice over.

    391 (or 391-390) referred to in Andoc. "De Pace." See Jebb, "Att.

 (2) Grote and Curtius believe these to be the Isthmian games of 390
    B.C., not of 392 B.C., as Sauppe and others suppose. See Peter,
    "Chron. Table," p. 89, note 183; Jowett, "Thuc." ii. 468, note on
    VIII. 9, 1.

 (3) Lit. "road to Cenchreae."

On the fourth day Agesilaus led his troops against Peiraeum, but finding it strongly defended,
he made a sudden retrograde march after the morning meal in the direction of the capital, as
though he calculated on the betrayal of the city. The Corinthians, in apprehension of some
such possible catastrophe, sent to summon Iphicrates with the larger portion of his light infantry.
These passed by duly in the night, not unobserved, however, by Agesilaus, who at once turned
round at break of day and advanced on Piraeum. He himself kept to the low ground by the hot
springs, (4) sending a division to scale the top of the pass. That night he encamped at the
hot springs, while the division bivouacked in the open, in possession of the pass. Here Agesilaus
distinguished himself by an invention as seasonable as it was simple. Among those who carried
provisions for the division not one had thought of bringing fire. The altitude was considerable;
there had been a fall of rain and hail towards evening and the temperature was low; besides
which, the scaling party were clad in thin garments suited to the summer season. There they
sat shivering in the dark, with scarcely heart to attack their suppers, when Agesilaus sent
up to them as many as ten porters carrying fire in earthen pots. One found his way up one way,
one another, and presently there were many bonfires blazing--magnificently enough, since there
was plenty of wood to hand; so that all fell to oiling themselves and many supped over again.
The same night the sky was lit up by the blaze of the temple of Poseidon--set on fire no one
knows how.

 (4) Near mod. Lutraki.

When the men in Piraeum perceived that the pass was occupied, they at once abandoned all thought
of self-defence and fled for refuge to the Heraion (5)--men and women, slaves and free-born,
with the greater part of their flocks and herds. Agesilaus, with the main body, meanwhile pursued
his march by the sea-shore, and the division, simultaneously descending from the heights, captured
the fortified position of Oenoe, appropriating its contents. Indeed, all the troops on that
day reaped a rich harvest in the supplies they brought in from various farmsteads. Presently
those who had escaped into the Heraion came out, offering to leave it to Agesilaus to decide
what he would do with them. He decided to deliver up to the exiles all those concerned with
the late butchery, and that all else should be sold. And so from the Heraion streamed out a
long line of prisoners, whilst from other sides embassies arrived in numbers; and amongst these
a deputation from the Boeotians, anxious to learn what they should do to obtain peace. These
latter Agesilaus, with a certain loftiness of manner, affected not even to see, although Pharax,
(6) their proxenus, stood by their side to introduce them. Seated in a circular edifice on
the margin of the lake, (7) he surveyed the host of captives and valuables as they were brought
out. Beside the prisoners, to guard them, stepped the Lacedaemonian warriors from the camp,
carrying their spears--and themselves plucked all gaze their way, so readily will success and
the transient fortune of the moment rivet attention. But even while Agesilaus was still thus
seated, wearing a look betokening satisfaction at some great achievement, a horseman came galloping
up; the flanks of his charger streamed with sweat. To the many inquiries what news he brought,
the rider responded never a word; but being now close beside Agesilaus, he leaped from his
horse, and running up to him with lowering visage narrated the disaster of the Spartan division
(8) at Lechaeum. At these tidings the king sprang instantly from his seat, clutching his spear,
and bade his herald summon to a meeting the generals, captains of fifties, and commanders of
foreign brigades. (9) When these had rapidly assembled he bade them, seeing that the morning
meal had not yet been tasted, to swallow hastily what they could, and with all possible speed
to overtake him. But for himself, he, with the officers of the royal staff, (10) set off at
once without breakfast. His bodyguard, with their heavy arms, accompanied him with all speed--himself
in advance, the officers following behind. In this fashion he had already passed beyond the
warm springs, and was well within the plateau of Lechaeum, when three horsemen rode up with
further news: the dead bodies had been picked up. On receipt of these tidings he commanded
the troops to order arms, and having rested them a little space, led them back again to the
Heraion. The next day he spent in disposing of the captured property. (11)

The ambassadors of the Boeotians were then summoned, and, being asked to explain the object
of their coming, made no further mention of the word "peace," but replied that, if there was
nothing to hinder it, they wished to have a pass to their own soldiers within the capital.
The king answered with a smile: "I know your desire is not so much to see your soldiers as
to feast your eyes on the good fortune of your friends, and to measure its magnitude. Wait
then, I will conduct you myself; with me you will be better able to discover the true value
of what has taken place." And he was as good as his word. Next day he sacrificed, and led his
army up to the gates of Corinth. The trophy he respected, but not one tree did he leave standing--chopping
and burning, as proof positive that no one dared to face him in the field. And having so done,
he encamped about Lechaeum; and as to the Theban ambassadors, in lieu of letting them pass
into the city, he sent them off by sea across to Creusis.

But in proportion to the unwontedness of such a calamity befalling Lacedaemonians, a widespread
mourning fell upon the whole Laconian army, those alone excepted whose sons or fathers or brothers
had died at their post. The bearing of these resembled that of conquerors, (12) as with bright
faces they moved freely to and fro, glorying in their domestic sorrow. Now the tragic fate
which befell the division was on this wise: It was the unvaried custom of the men of Amyclae
to return home at the Hyacinthia, (13) to join in the sacred paean, a custom not to be interrupted
by active service or absence from home or for any other reason. So, too, on this occasion,
Agesilaus had left behind all the Amyclaeans serving in any part of his army at Lechaeum. At
the right moment the general in command of the garrison at that place had posted the garrison
troops of the allies to guard the walls during his absence, and put himself at the head of
his division of heavy infantry with that of the cavalry, (14) and led the Amyclaeans past the
walls of Corinth. Arrived at a point within three miles or so (15) of Sicyon, the polemarch
turned back himself in the direction of Lechaeum with his heavy infantry regiment, six hundred
strong, giving orders to the cavalry commandant to escort the Amyclaeans with his division
as far as they required, and then to turn and overtake him. It cannot be said that the Lacedaemonians
were ignorant of the large number of light troops and heavy infantry inside Corinth, but owing
to their former successes they arrogantly presumed that no one would attack them. Within the
capital of the Corinthians, however, their scant numbers--a thin line of heavy infantry unsupported
by light infantry or cavalry--had been noted; and Callias, the son of Hipponicus, (16) who
was in command of the Athenian hoplites, and Iphicrates at the head of his peltasts, saw no
risk in attacking with the light brigade. Since if the enemy continued his march by the high
road, he would be cut up by showers of javelins on his exposed right flank; or if he were tempted
to take the offensive, they with their peltasts, the nimblest of all light troops, would easily
slip out of the grasp of his hoplites.

With this clearly-conceived idea they led out their troops; and while Callias drew up his heavy
infantry in line at no great distance from the city, Iphicrates and his peltasts made a dash
at the returning division.

The Lacedaemonians were presently within range of the javelins. (17) Here a man was wounded,
and there another dropped, not to rise again. Each time orders were given to the attendant
shield-bearers (18) to pick up the men and bear them into Lechaeum; and these indeed were the
only members of the mora who were, strictly speaking, saved. Then the polemarch ordered the
ten-years-service men (19) to charge and drive off their assailants. Charge, however, as they
might, they took nothing by their pains--not a man could they come at within javelin range.
Being heavy infantry opposed to light troops, before they could get to close quarters the enemy's
word of command sounded "Retire!" whilst as soon as their own ranks fell back, scattered as
they were in consequence of a charge where each man's individual speed had told, Iphicrates
and his men turned right about and renewed the javelin attack, while others, running alongside,
harassed their exposed flank. At the very first charge the assailants had shot down nine or
ten, and, encouraged by this success, pressed on with increasing audacity. These attacks told
so severely that the polemarch a second time gave the order (and this time for the fifteen-years-service
men) to charge. The order was promptly obeyed, but on retiring they lost more men than on the
first occasion, and it was not until the pick and flower of the division had succumbed that
they were joined by their returning cavalry, in whose company they once again attempted a charge.
The light infantry gave way, but the attack of the cavalry was feebly enforced. Instead of
pressing home the charge until at least they had sabred some of the enemy, they kept their
horses abreast of their infantry skirmishers, (20) charging and wheeling side by side.

    line); and so on. See below, IV. vi. 10.

 (20) See Thuc. iv. 125.

Again and again the monotonous tale of doing and suffering repeated itself, except that as
their own ranks grew thinner and their courage ebbed, the courage of their assailants grew
bolder and their numbers increased. In desperation they massed compactly upon the narrow slope
of a hillock, distant a couple of furlongs (21) or so from the sea, and a couple of miles (22)
perhaps from Lechaeum. Their friends in Lechaeum, perceiving them, embarked in boats and sailed
round until they were immediately under the hillock. And now, in the very slough of despair,
being so sorely troubled as man after man dropped dead, and unable to strike a blow, to crown
their distress they saw the enemy's heavy infantry advancing. Then they took to flight; some
of them threw themselves into the sea; others--a mere handful--escaped with the cavalry into
Lechaeum. The death-roll, including those who fell in the second fight and the final flight,
must have numbered two hundred and fifty slain, or thereabouts. (23) Such is the tale of the
destruction of the Lacedaemonian mora.

 (21) Lit. "two stades."

 (22) Lit. "sixteen or seventeen stades."

 (23) See Grote, "H. G." ix. 486.

Subsequently, with the mutilated fragment of the division, Agesilaus turned his back upon Lechaeum,
leaving another division behind to garrison that port. On his passage homewards, as he wound
his way through the various cities, he made a point of arriving at each as late in the day
as possible, renewing his march as early as possible next morning. Leaving Orchomenus at the
first streak of dawn, he passed Mantinea still under cover of darkness. The spectacle of the
Mantineans rejoicing at their misfortune would have been too severe an ordeal for his soldiers.

But Iphicrates had not yet reached the summit of his good fortune. Success followed upon success.
Lacedaemonian garrisons had been placed in Sidus and Crommyon by Praxitas when he took these
fortresses, and again in Oenoe, when Peiraeum was taken quite lately by Agesilaus. One and
all of these now fell into the hands of Iphicrates. Lechaeum still held out, garrisoned as
it was by the Lacedaemonians and their allies; while the Corinthian exiles, unable since (24)
the disaster of the mora any longer to pass freely by land from Sicyon, had the sea passage
still open to them, and using Lechaeum as their base, (25) kept up a game of mutual annoyance
with the party in the capital.

 (24) Lit. "owing to."

 (25) The illustrative incidents narrated in chapter iv. 17 may belong
    to this period.

B.C. 390-389. (1) At a later date the Achaeans, being in possession of Calydon, a town from
old times belonging to Aetolia, and having further incorporated the Calydonians as citizens,
(2) were under the necessity of garrisoning their new possession. The reason was, that the
Arcarnanians were threatening the place with an army, and were aided by contingents from Athens
and Boeotia, who were anxious to help their allies. (3) Under the strain of this combined attack
the Achaeans despatched ambassadors to Lacedaemon, who on arrival complained of the unfair
conduct of Lacedaemon towards themselves. "We, sirs," they said, "are ever ready to serve in
your armies, in obedience to whatever orders you choose to issue; we follow you whithersoever
you think fit to lead; but when it comes to our being beleaguered by the Acarnanians, with
their allies the Athenians and Boeotians, you show not the slightest concern. Understand, then,
that if things go on thus we cannot hold out; but either we must give up all part in the war
in Peloponnesus and cross over in full force to engage the Arcarnanians, or we must make peace
with them on whatever terms we can." This language was a tacit threat that if they failed to
obtain the assistance they felt entitled to from Lacedaemon they would quit the alliance.

 (1) According to others (who suppose that the Isthmia and the events
    recorded in chapter v. 1-19 above belong to B.C. 392), we have now
    reached B.C. 391.

 (2) Or, "having conferred a city organisation on the Calydonians."

 (3) See Thuc. ii. 68.

The ephors and the assembly concluded that there was no alternative but to assist the Achaeans
in their campaign against the Acarnanians. Accordingly they sent out Agesilaus with two divisions
and the proper complement of allies. The Achaeans none the less marched out in full force themselves.
No sooner had Agesilaus crossed the gulf than there was a general flight of the population
from the country districts into the towns, whilst the flocks and herds were driven into remote
districts that they might not be captured by the troops. Being now arrived on the frontier
of the enemy's territory, Agesilaus sent to the general assembly of the Acarnanians at Stratus,
(4) warning them that unless they chose to give up their alliance with the Boeotians and Athenians,
and to take instead themselves and their allies, he would ravage their territory through its
length and breadth, and not spare a single thing. When they turned a deaf ear to this summons,
the other proceeded to do what he threatened, systematically laying the district waste, felling
the timber and cutting down the fruit-trees, while slowly moving on at the rate of ten or twelve
furlongs a day. The Acarnanians, owing to the snail-like progress of the enemy, were lulled
into a sense of security. They even began bringing down their cattle from their alps, and devoted
themselves to the tillage of far the greater portion of their fields. But Agesilaus only waited
till their rash confidence reached its climax; then on the fifteenth or sixteenth day after
he head first entered the country he sacrificed at early dawn, and before evening had traversed
eighteen miles (5) or so of country to the lake (6) round which were collected nearly all the
flocks and herds of the Acarnanians, and so captured a vast quantity of cattle, horses, and
grazing stock of all kinds, besides numerous slaves.

 (4) "The Akarnanians had, in early times, occupied the hill of Olpai
    as a place for judicial proceedings common to the whole nation"
    (see Thuc. iii. 105). "But in Thucydides' own time Stratos had
    attained its position as the greatest city of Akarnania, and
    probably the Federal Assemblies were already held there" (Thuc.
    ii. 80). "In the days of Agesilaos we find Stratos still more
    distinctly marked as the place of Federal meeting."--Freeman,
    "Hist. Fed. Gov." ch. iv. p. 148 foll., "On the constitution of
    the League."

 (5) Lit. "one hundred and sixty stades."

 (6) See Thuc. ii. 80; vi. 106.

Having secured this prize, he stayed on the spot the whole of the following day, and devoted
himself to disposing of the captured property by public sale. While he was thus engaged, a
large body of Arcarnanian light infantry appeared, and availing themselves of the position
in which Agesilaus was encamped against the mountain side, assailed him with volleys of sling-stones
and rocks from the razor-edge of the mountain, without suffering any scathe themselves. By
this means they succeeded in dislodging and forcing his troops down into the level plain, and
that too at an hour when the whole camp was engaged in preparations for the evening meal. As
night drew on, the Acarnanians retired; sentinels were posted, and the troops slept in peace.

Next day Agesilaus led off his army. The exit from the plain and meadow-land round the lake
was a narrow aperture through a close encircling range of hills. In occupation of this mountain
barrier the Acarnanians, from the vantage-ground above, poured down a continuous pelt of stones
and other missiles, or, creeping down to the fringes, dogged and annoyed them so much that
the army was no longer able to proceed. If the heavy infantry or cavalry made sallies from
the main line they did no harm to their assailants, for the Acarnanians had only to retire
and they had quickly gained their strongholds. It was too severe a task, Agesilaus thought,
to force his way through the narrow pass so sorely beset. He made up his mind, therefore, to
charge that portion of the enemy who dogged his left, though these were pretty numerous. The
range of hills on this side was more accessible to heavy infantry and horse alike. During the
interval needed for the inspection of victims, the Acarnanians kept plying them with javelins
and bullets, and, coming into close proximity, wounded man after man. But presently came the
word of command, "Advance!" and the fifteen-years-service men of the heavy infantry (7) ran
forward, accompanied by the cavalry, at a round pace, the general himself steadily following
with the rest of the column. Those of the Acarnanians who had crept down the mountain side
at that instant in the midst of their sharpshooting turned and fled, and as they climbed the
steep, man after man was slain. When, however, the top of the pass was reached, there stood
the hoplites of the Acarnanians drawn up in battle line, and supported by the mass of their
light infantry. There they steadily waited, keeping up a continuous discharge of missiles the
while, or launching their long spears; whereby they dealt wounds to the cavalry troopers and
death in some cases to the horses. But when they were all but within the clutches of the advancing
heavy infantry (8) of the Lacedaemonians their firmness forsook them; they swerved and fled,
and there died of them on that day about three hundred. So ended the affair.

 (7) I.e. "the first two ranks." See above, IV. v. 14.

 (8) See "Ages." ii. 20, for an extraordinary discrepancy.

Agesilaus set up a trophy of victory, and afterwards making a tour of the country, he visited
it with fire and sword. (9) Occasionally, in obedience to pressure put upon him by the Achaeans,
he would assault some city, but did not capture a single one. And now, as the season of autumn
rapidly approached, he prepared to leave the country; whereupon the Achaeans, who looked upon
his exploits as abortive, seeing that not a single city, willingly or unwillingly, had as yet
been detached from their opponents, begged him, as the smallest service he could render them,
at any rate to stay long enough in the country to prevent the Acarnanians from sowing their
corn. He answered that the course they suggested ran counter to expediency. "You forget," he
said, "that I mean to invade your enemies again next summer; and therefore the larger their
sowing now, the stronger will be their appetite for peace hereafter." With this retort he withdrew
overland through Aetolia, and by roads, moreover, which no army, small or great, could possibly
have traversed without the consent of the inhabitants. The Aetolians, however, were only too
glad to yield the Spartan king a free passage, cherishing hopes as they did that he would aid
them to recover Naupactus. On reaching Rhium (10) he crossed the gulf at that point and returned
homewards, the more direct passage from Calydon to Peloponnesus being effectually barred by
an Athenian squadron stationed at Oeniadae.

B.C. 389-388. (1) On the expiration of winter, and in fulfilment of his promise to the Achaeans,
Agesilaus called out the ban once more with early spring to invade the Acarnanians. The latter
were apprised of his intention, and, being persuaded that owing to the midland situation of
their cities they would just as truly be blockaded by an enemy who chose to destroy their corn
as they would be if besieged with entrenchments in regular form, they sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon,
and made peace with the Achaeans and alliance with the Lacedaemonians. Thus closes this page
of history concerning the affairs of Arcarnania.

 (1) According to others, B.C. 390.

To turn to the next. There was a feeling on the part of the Lacedaemonians (2) that no expedition
against Athens or Boeotia would be safe so long as a state so important and so close to their
own frontier as Argos remained in open hostility behind them. Accordingly they called out the
ban against Argos. Now when Agesipolis learnt that the duty of leadership devolved on him,
and, moreover, that the sacrifices before crossing the frontier were favourable, he went to
Olympia and consulted the will of the god. "Would it be lawful to him," he inquired, "not to
accept the holy truce, on the ground that the Argives made the season for it (3) depend not
on a fixed date, but on the prospect of a Lacedaemonian invasion?" The god indicated to the
inquirer that he might lawfully repudiate any holy truce which was fraudulently antedated.
(4) Not content with this, the young king, on leaving Olympia, went at once to Delphi, and
at that shrine put the same question to Apollo: "Were his views in accordance with his Father's
as touching the holy truce?"--to which the son of Zeus made answer: "Yea, altogether in accordance."
(5)

 (2) Or, "It was agreed by the Lacedaemonians."

 (3) I.e. "the season of the Carneia."

 (4) Or, "wrongfully put forward." See below, V. i. 29; iii. 28; Paus.
    III. v. 8; Jebb. "Att. Or." i. p. 131; Grote, "H. G." ix. 494
    foll.; Jowett, "Thuc." ii. 315; note to Thuc. V. liv. 3.

 (5) Grote; cf. Aristot. "Rhet." ii. 33.

Then without further hesitation, picking up his army at Phlius (where, during his absence to
visit the temples, the troops had been collecting), he advanced by Nemea into the enemy's territory.
The Argives, on their side, perceiving that they would be unable to hinder his advance, in
accordance with their custom sent a couple of heralds, garlanded, and presented their usual
plea of a holy truce. Agesipolis answered them curtly that the gods were not satisfied with
the justice of their plea, and, refusing to accept the truce, pushed forward, causing thereby
great perplexity and consternation throughout the rural districts and the capital itself.

But while he was getting his evening meal that first evening in the Argive territory--just
at the moment when the after-dinner libation had been poured out--the god sent an earthquake;
and with one consent the Lacedaemonians, beginning with the officers of the royal quarters,
sang the sacred hymn of Poseidon. The soldiers, in general, expected to retreat, arguing that,
on the occurrence of an earthquake once before, Agis had retired from Elis. But Agesipolis
held another view: if the god had sent his earthquake at the moment when he was meditating
invasion, he should have understood that the god forbade his entrance; but now, when the invasion
was a thing effected, he must needs take it as a signal of his approval. (6) Accordingly next
morning he sacrificed to Poseidon, and advanced a short distance further into the country.

 (6) Or, "interpret the signal as a summons to advance."

The late expedition of Agesilaus into Argos (7) was still fresh in men's minds, and Agesipolis
was eager to ascertain from the soldiers how close his predecessor had advanced to the fortification
walls; or again, how far he had gone in ravaging the open country--not unlike a competitor
in the pentathlon, (8) eager to cap the performance of his rival in each event. On one occasion
it was only the discharge of missiles from the towers which forced him to recross the trenches
round the walls; on another, profiting by the absence of the majority of the Argives in Laconian
territory, he came so close to the gates that their officers actually shut out their own Boeotian
cavalry on the point of entering, in terror lest the Lacedaemonians might pour into the town
in company, and these Boeotian troopers were forced to cling, like bats to a wall, under each
coign of vantage beneath the battlements. Had it not been for the accidental absence of the
Cretans, (9) who had gone off on a raid to Nauplia, without a doubt numbers of men and horses
would have been shot down. At a later date, while encamping in the neighbourhood of the Enclosures,
(10) a thunder-bolt fell into his camp. One or two men were struck, while others died from
the effect of the concussion on their brains. At a still later period he was anxious to fortify
some sort of garrison outpost in the pass of Celusa, (11) but upon offering sacrifice the victims
proved lobeless, (12) and he was constrained to lead back and disband his army--not without
serious injury inflicted on the Argives, as the result of an invasion which had taken them
wholly by surprise.

 (7) See above, "Hell." IV. iv. 19.

 (8) The pentathlon of Olympia and the other great games consisted of
    five contests, in the following order--(1) leaping, (2) discus-
    throwing, (3) javelin-throwing, (4) running, (5) wrestling. Cf.
    Simonides, {alma podokeien diskon akonta palen}, where, "metri
    gratia," the order is inverted. The competitors were drawn in
    pairs. The odd man who drew a bye in any particular round or heat
    was called the "ephedros." The successful athletes of the pairs,
    that is, those who had won any three events out of five, would
    then again be drawn against each other, and so on until only two
    were left, between whom the final heat took place. See, for an
    exhaustive discussion of the subject, Prof. Percy Gardner, "The
    Pentathlon of the Greeks" ("Journal of Hellenic Studies," vol. i.
    9, p. 210 foll. pl. viii.), from whom this note is taken.

394 B.C. Such were the land operations in the war. Meanwhile another series of events was being
enacted on the sea and within the seaboard cities; and these I will now narrate in detail.
But I shall confine my pen to the more memorable incidents, and others of less account I shall
pass over.

In the first place, then, Pharnabazus and Conon, after defeating the Lacedaemonians in the
naval engagement of Cnidus, commenced a tour of inspection round the islands and the maritime
states, expelling from them, as they visited them, one after another the Spartan governors.
(1) Everywhere they gave consolatory assurances to the citizens that they had no intention
of establishing fortress citadels within their walls, or in any way interfering with their
self-government. (2) Such words fell soothingly upon the ears of those to whom they were addressed;
the proposals were courteously accepted; all were eager to present Pharnabazus with gifts of
friendship and hospitality. The satrap, indeed, was only applying the instructions of his master
Conon on these matters--who had taught him that if he acted thus all the states would be friendly
to him, whereas, if he showed any intention to enslave them, the smallest of them would, as
Conon insisted, be capable of causing a world of trouble, and the chances were, if apprehensions
were once excited, he would find himself face to face with a coalition of united Hellas. To
these admonitions Pharnabazus lent a willing ear.

 (1) Lit. "the Laconian harmosts."

 (2) See Hicks, 70, "Honours to Konon," Inscript. found at Erythrae in
    Ionia. Cf. Diod. xiv. 84.

Accordingly, when disembarking at Ephesus, he presented Conon with a fleet of forty sail, (3)
and having further instructed him to meet him at Sestos, (4) set off himself by land along
the coast to visit his own provinces. For here it should be mentioned that his old enemy Dercylidas
happened to be in Abydos at the time of the sea-fight; (5) nor had he at a later date suffered
eclipse with the other governors, (6) but on the contrary, had kept tight hold of Abydos and
still preserved it in attachment to Lacedaemon. The course he had adopted was to summon a meeting
of the Abydenians, when he made them a speech as follows: "Sirs, to-day it is possible for
you, who have before been friends to my city, to appear as benefactors of the Lacedaemonians.
For a man to prove faithful to his friends in the heyday of their good fortune is no great
marvel; but to prove steadfast when his friends are in misfortune--that is a service monumental
for all time. But do not mistake me. It does not follow that, because we have been defeated
in a great sea-fight, we are therefore annihilated. (7) Certainly not. Even in old days, you
will admit, when Athens was mistress of the sea, our state was not powerless to benefit friends
or chastise enemies. Moreover, in proportion as the rest of the cities have joined hands with
fortune to turn their backs upon us, so much the more certainly will the grandeur of your fidelity
shine forth. Or, is any one haunted by the fear that we may find ourselves blockaded by land
and sea?--let him consider that at present there is no Hellenic navy whatever on the seas,
and if the barbarian attempts to clutch the empire of the sea, Hellas will not sit by and suffer
it; so that, if only in self-defence, she must inevitably take your side."

 (3) See Diod. xiv. 83.

 (4) See above, "Hell." II. i. 27 foll.

 (5) See above, "Hell." IV. iii. 3.

 (6) Lit. "harmosts."

 (7) Or, "we are beaten, ergo, it is all over with us."

To this the Abydenians lent no deaf ears, but rather responded with willingness approaching
enthusiasm--extending the hand of fellowship to the ex-governors, some of whom were already
flocking to Abydos as a harbour of refuge, whilst others they sent to summon from a distance.

So when a number of efficient and serviceable men had been collected, Dercylidas ventured to
cross over to Sestos--lying, as it does, not more than a mile (8) distant, directly facing
Abydos. There he not only set about collecting those who held lands in the Chersonese through
Lacedaemonian influence, but extended his welcome also to the governors (9) who had been driven
out of European states. (10) He insisted that, if they came to think of it, not even was their
case desperate, reminding them that even in Asia, which originally belonged to the Persian
monarch, places were to be found--such as the little state of Temnos, or Aegae, and others,
capable of administering their affairs, unsubjected to the king of Persia. "But," he added,
"if you want a strong impregnable position, I cannot conceive what better you can find than
Sestos. Why, it would need a combined naval and military force to invest that port." By these
and such like arguments he rescued them from the lethargy of despair.

 (8) Lit. "eight stades."

 (9) Lit. "harmosts."

 (10) See Demos. "de Cor." 96.

Now when Pharnabazus found Abydos and Sestos so conditioned, he gave them to understand that
unless they chose to eject the Lacedaemonians, he would bring war to bear upon them; and when
they refused to obey, having first assigned to Conon as his business to keep the sea closed
against them, he proceeded in person to ravage the territory of the men of Abydos. Presently,
finding himself no nearer the fulfilment of his object--which was their reduction--he set off
home himself and left it to Conon the while so to conciliate the Hellespontine states that
as large a naval power as possible might be mustered against the coming spring. In his wrath
against the Lacedaemonians, in return for the treatment he had received from them, his paramount
object was to invade their territory and exact what vengeance he could.

B.C. 393. The winter was thus fully taken up with preparations; but with the approach of spring,
Pharnabazus and Conon, with a large fleet fully manned, and a foreign mercenary brigade to
boot, threaded their way through the islands to Melos. (11) This island was to serve as a base
of operations against Lacedaemon. And in the first instance he sailed down to Pherae (12) and
ravaged that district, after which he made successive descents at various other points on the
seaboard, and did what injury he could. But in apprehension of the harbourless character of
the coast, coupled with the enemy's facility of reinforcement and his own scarcity of supplies,
he very soon turned back and sailed away, until finally he came to moorings in the harbour
of Phoenicus in Cythera. The occupants of the city of the Cytherians, in terror of being taken
by storm, evacuated the walls. To dismiss these under a flag of truce across to Laconia was
his first step; his second was to repair the fortress in question and to leave a garrison in
the island under an Athenian governor--Nicophemus. After this he set sail to the Isthmus of
Corinth, where he delivered an exhortation to the allies begging them to prosecute the war
vigorously, and to show themselves faithful to the Great King; and so, having left them all
the moneys he had with him, set off on his voyage home.

 (11) See Lys. xix. "de bon. Arist." 19 foll.; and Hicks, 71, "Honours
    to Dionysios I. and his court"; Grote, "H. G." ix. 453.

 (12) Mod. Kalamata.

But Conon had a proposal to make:--If Pharnabazus would allow him to keep the fleet, he would
undertake, in the first place, to support it free of expense from the islands; besides which,
he would sail to his own country and help his fellow-citizens the Athenians to rebuild their
long walls and the fortifications round Piraeus. No heavier blow, he insisted, could well be
inflicted on Lacedaemon. "In this way, I can assure you," he added, "you will win the eternal
gratitude of the Athenians and wreak consummate vengeance on the Lacedaemonians, since at one
stroke you will render null and void that on which they have bestowed their utmost labour."
These arguments so far weighed with Pharnabazus that he despatched Conon to Athens with alacrity,
and further supplied him with funds for the restoration of the walls. Thus it was that Conon,
on his arrival at Athens, was able to rebuild a large portion of the walls--partly by lending
his own crews, and partly by giving pay to carpenters and stone-masons, and meeting all the
necessary expenses. There were other portions of the walls which the Athenians and Boeotians
and other states raised as a joint voluntary undertaking.

Nor must it be forgotten that the Corinthians, with the funds left them by Pharnabazus, manned
a fleet--the command of which they entrusted to their admiral Agathinus--and so were undisputed
masters of the sea within the gulf round Achaia and Lechaeum.

B.C. 393-391. The Lacedaemonians, in opposition, fitted out a fleet under the command of Podanemus.
That officer, in an attack of no great moment, lost his life, and Pollis, (13) his second in
command, was presently in his turn obliged to retire, being wounded, whereupon Herippidas took
command of the vessels. On the other hand, Proaenus the Corinthian, who had relieved Agathinus,
evacuated Rhium, and the Lacedaemonians recovered that post. Subsequently Teleutias succeeded
to Herippidas's fleet, and it was then the turn of that admiral to dominate the gulf. (14)

 (13) See "Hell." I. i. 23.

 (14) According to Grote ("H. G." ix. 471, note 2), this section
    summarises the Lacedaemonian maritime operations in the Corinthian
    Gulf from the late autumn of 393 B.C. till the appointment of
    Teleutias in the spring or early summer of 391 B.C., the year of
    the expedition of Agesilaus recounted above, "Hell." IV. iv. 19.

B.C. 392. The Lacedaemonians were well informed of the proceedings of Conon. They knew that
he was not only restoring the fortifications of Athens by help of the king's gold, but maintaining
a fleet at his expense besides, and conciliating the islands and seaboard cities towards Athens.
If, therefore, they could indoctrinate Tiribazus--who was a general of the king--with their
sentiments, they believed they could not fail either to draw him aside to their own interests,
or, at any rate, to put a stop to his feeding Conon's navy. With this intention they sent Antalcidas
to Tiribazus: (15) his orders were to carry out this policy and, if possible, to arrange a
peace between Lacedaemon and the king. The Athenians, getting wind of this, sent a counter-embassy,
consisting of Hermogenes, Dion, Callisthenes, and Callimedon, with Conon himself. They at the
same time invited the attendance of ambassadors from the allies, and there were also present
representatives of the Boeotians, of Corinth, and of Argos. When they had arrived at their
destination, Antalcidas explained to Tiribazus the object of his visit: he wished, if possible,
to cement a peace between the state he represented and the king--a peace, moreover, exactly
suited to the aspirations of the king himself; in other words, the Lacedaemonians gave up all
claim to the Hellenic cities in Asia as against the king, while for their own part they were
content that all the islands and other cities should be independent. "Such being our unbiased
wishes," he continued, "for what earthly reason should (the Hellenes or) the king go to war
with us? or why should he expend his money? The king is guaranteed against attack on the part
of Hellas, since the Athenians are powerless apart from our hegemony, and we are powerless
so long as the separate states are independent." The proposals of Antalcidas sounded very pleasantly
in the ears of Tiribazus, but to the opponents of Sparta they were the merest talk. The Athenians
were apprehensive of an agreement which provided for the independence of the cities in the
islands, whereby they might be deprived of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros. The Thebans, again,
were afraid of being compelled to let the Boeotian states go free. The Argives did not see
how such treaty contracts and covenants were compatible with the realisation of their own great
object--the absorption of Corinth by Argos. And so it came to pass that this peace (16) proved
abortive, and the representatives departed each to his own home.

 (15) See Plut. "Ages." xxiii. (Clough, iv. p. 27); and for the date
    B.C. 392 (al. B.C. 393) see Grote, "H. G." ix. 498.

 (16) See Andoc. "de Pace"; Jebb, "Attic Or." i. 83, 128 foll. Prof.
    Jebb assigns this speech to B.C. 390 rather than B.C. 391. See
    also Grote, "H. G." ix. 499; Diod. xiv. 110.

Tiribazus, on his side, thought it hardly consistent with his own safety to adopt the cause
of the Lacedaemonians without the concurrence of the king--a scruple which did not prevent
him from privately presenting Antalcidas with a sum of money, in hopes that when the Athenians
and their allies discovered that the Lacedaemonians had the wherewithal to furnish a fleet,
they might perhaps be more disposed to desire peace. Further, accepting the statements of the
Lacedaemonians as true, he took on himself to secure the person of Conon, as guilty of wrongdoing
towards the king, and shut him up. (17) That done, he set off up country to the king to recount
the proposals of Lacedaemon, with his own subsequent capture of Conon as a mischievous man,
and to ask for further guidance on all these matters.

 (17) See Diod. xiv. 85; and Corn. Nep. 5.

On the arrival of Tiribazus at the palace, the king sent down Struthas to take charge of the
seaboard district. The latter, however, was a strong partisan of Athens and her allies, since
he found it impossible to forget the long list of evils which the king's country had suffered
at the hands of Agesilaus; so that the Lacedaemonians, contrasting the hostile disposition
of the new satrap towards themselves with his friendliness to the Athenians, sent Thibron to
deal with him by force of arms.

B.C. 391. (18) That general crossed over and established his base of operations in Ephesus
and the towns in the plain of the Maeander--Priene, Leucophrys, and Achilleum--and proceeded
to harry the king's territory, sparing neither live nor dead chattels. But as time went on,
Struthas, who could not but note the disorderly, and indeed recklessly scornful manner in which
the Lacedaemonian brought up his supports on each occasion, despatched a body of cavalry into
the plain. Their orders were to gallop down and scour the plain, making a clean sweep (19)
of all they could lay their hands on. Thibron, as it befell, had just finished breakfast, and
was returning to the mess with Thersander the flute-player. The latter was not only a good
flute-player, but, as affecting Lacedaemonian manners, laid claim to personal prowess. Struthas,
then, seeing the disorderly advance of the supports and the paucity of the vanguard, appeared
suddenly at the head of a large body of cavalry, all in orderly array. Thibron and Thersander
were the first to be cut down, and when these had fallen the rest of the troops were easily
turned. A mere chase ensued, in which man after man was felled to earth, though a remnant contrived
to escape into the friendly cities; still larger numbers owed their safety to their late discovery
of the business on hand. Nor, indeed, was this the first time the Spartan commander had rushed
to the field, without even issuing a general order. So ends the history of these events.

 (18) Al. B.C. 392, al. B.C. 390.

 (19) See "Hell." VII. i. 40; "Cyrop." I. iv. 17; III. iii. 23; "Anab."
    VI. iii. 3.

B.C. 390. (20) We pass on to the arrival at Lacedaemon of a party of Rhodian exiles expelled
by the popular party. They insisted that it was not equitable to allow the Athenians to subjugate
Rhodes and thus build up so vast a power. The Lacedaemonians were alive to the fact that the
fate of Rhodes depended on which party in the state prevailed: if the democracy were to dominate,
the whole island must fall into the hands of Athens; if the wealthier classes, (21) into their
own. Accordingly they fitted out for them a fleet of eight vessels, and put Ecdicus in command
of it as admiral.

 (20) Grote, "H. G." ix. 504; al. B.C. 391.

 (21) Or, "the Lacedaemonians were not slow to perceive that the whole
    island of Rhodes was destined to fall either into the hands of
    Athens or of themselves, according as the democracy or the
    wealthier classes respectively dominated."

At the same time they despatched another officer on board these vessels named Diphridas, on
a separate mission. His orders were to cross over into Asia and to secure the states which
had received Thibron. He was also to pick up the survivors of Thibron's army, and with these
troops, aided by a second army which he would collect from any other quarter open to him, he
was to prosecute the war against Struthas. Diphridas followed out his instructions, and amongst
other achievements was fortunate enough to capture Tigranes, (22) the son-in-law of Struthas,
with his wife, on their road to Sardis. The sum paid for their ransom was so large that he
at once had the wherewithal to pay his mercenaries. Diphridas was no less attractive than his
predecessor Thibron; but he was of a more orderly temperament, steadier, and incomparably more
enterprising as a general; the secret of this superiority being that he was a man over whom
the pleasures of the body exercised no sway. He became readily absorbed in the business before
him--whatever he had to do he did it with a will.

 (22) See "Anab." VII. viii. 9 for a similar exploit.

Ecdicus having reached Cnidus, there learned that the democracy in Rhones were entirely masters
of the situation. They were dominant by land and sea; indeed they possessed a fleet twice the
size of his own. He was therefore content to keep quiet in Cnidus until the Lacedaemonians,
perceiving that his force was too small to allow him to benefit their friends, determined to
relieve him. With this view they ordered Teleutias to take the twelve ships which formed his
squadron (at present in the gulf adjoining Achaia and Lechaeum), (23) and to feel his way round
to Ecdicus: that officer he was to send home. For himself, he was to undertake personally to
protect the interests of all who cared to be their friends, whilst injuring the enemy by every
possible means.

 (23) See above, IV. viii. 11.

So then Teleutias, having reached Samos, where he added some vessels to his fleet, set sail
to Cnidus. At this point Ecdicus returned home, and Teleutias, continuing his voyage, reached
Rhodes, at the head now of seven-and-twenty vessels. It was during this portion of the voyage
that he fell in with Philocrates, the son of Ephialtes, who was sailing from Athens to Cyprus
with ten triremes, in aid of their ally Evagoras. (24) The whole flotilla fell into the Spartan's
hands--a curious instance, it may be added, of cross purposes on the part of both belligerents.
Here were the Athenians, supposed to be on friendly terms with the king, engaged in sending
an allied force to support Evagoras, who was at open war with him; and here again was Teleutias,
the representative of a people at war with Persia, engaged in crippling a fleet which had been
despatched on a mission hostile to their adversary. Teleutias put back into Cnidus to dispose
of his captives, and so eventually reached Rhodes, where his arrival brought timely aid to
the party in favour of Lacedaemon.

 (24) See Diod. xiv. 98; Hicks, 72; Kohler, "C. I. A." ii. p. 397;
    Isoc. "Evag." 54-57; Paus. I. iii. 1; Lys. "de bon. Ar." 20; Dem.
    p. 161.

B.C. 389. (25) And now the Athenians, fully impressed with the belief that their rivals were
laying the basis of a new naval supremacy, despatched Thrasybulus the Steirian to check them,
with a fleet of forty sail. That officer set sail, but abstained from bringing aid to Rhodes,
and for good reasons. In Rhodes the Lacedaemonian party had hold of the fortress, and would
be out of reach of his attack, especially as Teleutias was close at hand to aid them with his
fleet. On the other hand, his own friends ran no danger of succumbing to the enemy, as they
held the cities and were numerically much stronger, and they had established their superiority
in the field. Consequently he made for the Hellespont, where, in the absence of any rival power,
he hoped to achieve some stroke of good fortune for his city. Thus, in the first place, having
detected the rivalries existing between Medocus, (26) the king of the Odrysians, and Seuthes,
(27) the rival ruler of the seaboard, he reconciled them to each other, and made them friends
and allies of Athens; in the belief that if he secured their friendship the Hellenic cities
on the Thracian coast would show greater proclivity to Athens. Such being the happy state of
affairs not only in Europe but as regards the states in Asia also, thanks to the friendly attitude
of the king to his fellow-citizens, he sailed into Byzantium and sold the tithe-duty levied
on vessels arriving from the Euxine. By another stroke he converted the oligarchy of Byzantium
into a democracy. The result of this was that the Byzantine demos (28) were no longer sorry
to see as vast a concourse of Athenians in their city as possible. Having so done, and having
further won the friendship of the men of Calchedon, he set sail south of the Hellespont. Arrived
at Lesbos, he found all the cities devoted to Lacedaemon with the exception of Mytilene. He
was therefore loth to attack any of the former until he had organised a force within the latter.
This force consisted of four hundred hoplites, furnished from his own vessels, and a corps
of exiles from the different cities who had sought shelter in Mytilene; to which he added a
stout contingent, the pick of the Mytileneian citizens themselves. He stirred the ardour of
the several contingents by suitable appeals: representing to the men of Mytilene that by their
capture of the cities they would at once become the chiefs and patrons of Lesbos; to the exiles
he made it appear that if they would but unite to attack each several city in turn, they might
all reckon on their particular restoration; while he needed only to remind his own warriors
that the acquisition of Lesbos meant not only the attachment of a friendly city, but the discovery
of a mine of wealth. The exhortations ended and the contingents organised, he advanced against
Methymna.

    prosperity, Polyb. iv. 38-47.

Therimachus, who chanced to be the Lacedaemonian governor at the time, on hearing of the meditated
attack of Thrasybulus, had taken a body of marines from his vessels, and, aided by the citizens
of Methymna themselves, along with all the Mytileneian exiles to be found in that place, advanced
to meet the enemy on their borders. A battle was fought and Therimachus was slain, a fate shared
by several of the exiles of his party.

As a result (29) of his victory the Athenian general succeeded in winning the adhesion of some
of the states; or, where adhesion was refused, he could at least raise supplies for his soldiers
by freebooting expeditions, and so hastened to reach his goal, which was the island of Rhodes.
His chief concern was to support as powerful an army as possible in those parts, and with this
object he proceeded to levy money aids, visiting various cities, until he finally reached Aspendus,
and came to moorings in the river Eurymedon. The money was safely collected from the Aspendians,
and the work completed, when, taking occasion of some depredations (30) of the soldiers on
the farmsteads, the people of the place in a fit of irritation burst into the general's quarters
at night and butchered him in his tent.

 (29) According to some critics, B.C. 389 is only now reached.

 (30) See Diod. xiv. 94.

So perished Thrasybulus, (31) a good and great man by all admission. In room of him the Athenians
chose Agyrrhius, (32) who was despatched to take command of the fleet. And now the Lacedaemonians--alive
to the fact that the sale of the Euxine tithe-dues had been negotiated in Byzantium by Athens;
aware also that as long as the Athenians kept hold on Calchedon the loyalty of the other Hellespontine
cities was secured to them (at any rate while Pharnabazus remained their friend)--felt that
the state of affairs demanded their serious attention. They attached no blame indeed to Dercylidas.
Anaxibius, however, through the friendship of the ephors, contrived to get himself appointed
as governor, on a mission to Abydos. With the requisite funds and ships, he promised to exert
such hostile pressure upon Athens that at least her prospects in the Hellespont would cease
to be so sunny. His friends the ephors granted him in return for these promises three ships
of war and funds to support a thousand mercenaries, and so they despatched him on his mission.
Reaching Abydos, he set about improving his naval and military position. First he collected
a foreign brigade, by help of which he drew off some of the Aeolid cities from Pharnabazus.
Next he set on foot a series of retaliatory expeditions against the states which attacked Abydos,
marching upon them and ravaging their territories; and lastly, manning three vessels besides
those which he already held in the harbour of Abydos, he intercepted and brought into port
all the merchant ships of Athens or of her allies which he could lay hands on.

 (31) "Thus perished the citizen to whom, more than any one else,
    Athens owed not only her renovated democracy, but its wise,
    generous, and harmonious working, after renovation."--Grote, "H.
    G." ix. 509.

    loc.; Aristoph. "Eccles." 102, and the Schol. ad loc.; Diod. xiv.
    99; Curtius, "H. G." Eng tr. iv. 280.

Getting wind of these proceedings, the Athenians, fearing lest the fair foundation laid for
them by Thrasybulus in the Hellespont should be ruined, sent out Iphicrates with eight vessels
and twelve hundred peltasts. The majority of them (33) consisted of troops which he had commanded
at Corinth. In explanation it may be stated that the Argives, when once they had appropriated
Corinth and incorporated it with Argos, gave out they had no further need of Iphicrates and
his troops; the real fact being that he had put to death some of the partisans of Argos. (34)
And so it was he turned his back on Corinth and found himself at home in Athens at the present
crisis.

    Argeian party, as opposed to the philo-Laconian party. See above,
    "Hell." IV. iv. 6.

B.C. 389-388. When Iphicrates first reached the Chersonese he and Anaxibius carried on war
against each other by the despatch of guerilla or piratic bands across the straits. But as
time wore on, information reached him of the departure of Anaxibius to Antandrus, accompanied
by his mercenaries and his own bodyguard of Laconians and two hundred Abydenian hoplites. Hearing
further that Anaxibius had won the friendly adhesion of Antandrus, Iphicrates conjectured that
after establishing a garrison in that place he would make the best of his way back, if only
to bring the Abydenians home again. He therefore crossed in the night, selecting a desert point
on the Abydene coast, from which he scaled the hills above the town and planted himself in
ambuscade within their folds. The triremes which brought him across had orders at break of
day to coast up northwards along the Chersonese, which would suggest the notion that he was
only out on one of his customary voyages to collect money. The sequel more than fulfilled his
expectations. Anaxibius began his return march, and if report speaks truly, he did so notwithstanding
that the victims were against his marching that day; contemptuously disregarding the warning,
and satisfied that his march lay all along through a friendly country and was directed to a
friendly city. Besides which, those whom he met assured him that Iphicrates was off on a voyage
to Proconnesus: hence the unusual absence of precaution on the march. On his side Iphicrates
saw the chance, but, so long as the troops of Anaxibius lingered on the level bottoms, refused
to spring from his lair, waiting for the moment when the Abydenian division in the van was
safely landed in the plain of Cremaste, at the point where the gold mines stand; the main column
following on the downward slope, and Anaxibius with his Laconians just beginning the descent.
At that instant Iphicrates set his ambuscade in motion, and dashed against the Spartan at full
speed. The latter quickly discerned that there was no hope of escape as he scanned the long
straggling line of his attenuated column. The troops in advance, he was persuaded, would never
be able to come back to his aid up the face of that acclivity; besides which, he observed the
utter bewilderment of the whole body at sight of the ambuscade. He therefore turned to those
next him, and spoke as follows: "Sirs, it is good for me to die on this spot, where honour
bids me; but for you, sirs, yonder your path lies, haste and save yourselves (35) before the
enemy can close with us." As the words died on his lips he took from the hands of his attendant
shield-bearer his heavy shield, and there, at his post, unflinchingly fought and fell; not
quite alone, for by his side faithfully lingered a favourite youth, and of the Lacedaemonian
governors who had rallied to Abydos from their several cities yet other twelve fought and fell
beside the pair. The rest fled, dropping down one by one as the army pursued them to the walls
of the city. The death-roll amounted to something like fifty hoplites of the Abydenians, and
of the rest two hundred. After this exploit Iphicrates returned to the Chersonese. (36)

BOOK V

I

B.C. 388. Such was the state of affairs in the Hellespont, so far at least as Athens and Sparta
are concerned. Eteonicus was once more in Aegina; and notwithstanding that the Aeginetans and
Athenians had up to this time held commercial intercourse, yet now that the war was plainly
to be fought out on the sea, that officer, with the concurrence of the ephorate, gave permission
to any one who liked to plunder Attica. (1) The Athenians retaliated by despatching a body
of hoplites under their general Pamphilus, who constructed a fort against the Aeginetans, (2)
and proceeded to blockade them by land and sea with ten warships. Teleutias, however, while
threading his way among the islands in question of contributions, had chanced to reach a point
where he received information of the turn in affairs with regard to the construction of the
fortress, whereupon he came to the rescue of the beleaguered Aeginetans, and so far succeeded
that he drove off the enemy's blockading squadron. But Pamphilus kept a firm hold on the offensive
fortress, and was not to be dislodged.

 (1) Or, "determined to let slip the hounds of war;" or, more
    prosaically, "issued letters of marque." See Grote, "H. G." ix.
    517.

 (2) I.e. in Aegina as an {epiteikhisma}.

After this the new admiral Hierax arrived from Lacedaemon. The naval force was transferred
into his successor's hands, and under the happiest auspices Teleutias set sail for home. As
he descended to the seashore to start on his homeward voyage there was not one among his soldiers
who had not a warm shake of the hand for their old admiral. Here one presented him with a crown,
and there another with a victor's wreath; and those who arrived too late, still, as the ship
weighed anchor, threw garlands into the sea and wafted him many a blessing with prayerful lips.
I am well aware that in the above incident I have no memorable story of munificence, peril,
or invention to narrate, but in all sincerity I protest that a man may find food for reflection
in the inquiry what Teleutias had done to create such a disposition in his subordinates. Here
we are brought face to face with a true man's work more worthy of account than multitudes of
riches or adventure. (3)

 (3) See Grote, "H. G." ix. 518: "The ideal of government as it
    presented itself to Xenophon was the paternal despotism or
    something like it," {to ethelonton arkhein}. Cf. "Cyrop." passim,
    "Heiro," and his various other compositions.

The new admiral Hierax, taking with him the larger portion of the fleet, set sail once more
for Rhodes. He left behind him twelve vessels in Aegina under his vice-admiral Gorgopas, who
was now installed as governor of that island. In consequence of this chance the Athenian troops
inside the fortres were more blockaded than the Aeginetans themselves, so much so that a vote
was passed by the Athenian assembly, in obedience to which a large fleet was manned, and the
garrison, after four months' sojourn in Aegina, were brought back. But this was no sooner done
than they began to be harassed by Gorgopas and the privateers again. To operate aganst these
they fitted out thirteen vessels, choosing Eunomus as admiral in command. Hierax was still
in Rhodes when the Lacedaemonians sent out a new admiral, Antalcidas; they believed that they
could not find a better mode of gratifying Tiribazus. Accordingly Antalcidas, after visiting
Aegina in order to pick up the vessels under Gorgopas, set sail for Ephesus. At this point
he sent back Gorgopas with his twelve ships to Aegina, and appointed his vice-admiral Nicolochus
to command the remainder of the fleet.

Nicolochus was to relieve Abydos, and thither set sail; but in the course of the voyage turned
aside to Tenedos, where he ravaged the territory, and, with the money so secured, sailed on
to Abydos. The Athenian generals (4) on their side, collecting from Samothrace, Thasos, and
the fortresses in that quarter, hastened to the relief of Tenedos; but, finding that Nicolochus
had continued his voyage to Abydos, they selected the Chersonese as their base, and proceeded
to blockade him and his fleet of five-and-twenty vessels with the two-and-thirty vessels under
their joint command.

 (4) And among the rest Iphicrates and Diotimus. See below, S. 25;
    above, IV. viii. 39.

Meanwhile Gorgopas, returning from Ephesus, fell in with the Athenian admiral Eunomus, and,
shunning an encounter at the moment, sought shelter in Aegina, which he reached a little before
sunset; and at once disembarking his men, set them down to their evening meal; whilst Eunomus
on his side, after hanging back for a little while, sailed away. Night fell, and the Athenian,
showing the customary signal light to prevent his squadron straggling, led the way in the darkness.
Gorgopas instantly got his men on board again, and, taking the lantern for his guide, followed
the Athenians, craftily lagging behind a little space, so as not to show himself or raise any
suspicion of his presence. In place of the usual cry the boatswains timed the rowers by a clink
of stones, and silently the oars slid, feathering through the waves (5); and just when the
squadron of Eunomus was touching the coast, off Cape Zoster (6) in Attica, the Spartan sounded
the bugle-note for the charge. Some of Eunomus's vessels were in the act of discharging their
crews, others were still getting to their moorings, whilst others were as yet only bearing
down to land. The engagement was fought by the light of the moon, and Gorgopas captured four
triremes, which he tied astern, and so set sail with his prizes in tow towards Aegina. The
rest of the Athenian squadron made their escape into the harbour of Piraeus.

 (5) Lit. "the boatswains employing a clink of stones and a sliding
    motion of the oars."

 (6) I.e. "Cape Girdle," mod. Cape Karvura. See Tozer, "Geog. of
    Greece," pp. 78, 372.

It was after these events that Chabrias (7) commenced his voyage to Cyprus, bringing relief
to Evagoras. His force consisted at first of eight hundred light troops and ten triremes, but
was further increased by other vessels from Athens and a body of heavy infantry. Thus reinforced,
the admiral chose a night and landed in Aegina; and secreted himself in ambuscade with his
light troops in hollow ground some way beyond the temple of Heracles. At break of day, as prearranged,
the Athenian hoplites made their appearance under command of Demaenetus, and began mounting
up between two and three miles (8) beyond the Kerakleion at Tripurgia, as it is called. The
news soon reached Gorgopas, who sallied out to the rescue with the Aeginetans and the marines
of his vessels, being further accompanied by eight Spartans who happened to be with him. Not
content with these he issued orders inviting any of the ships' crews, who were free men, to
join the relief party. A large number of these sailors responded. They armed themselves as
best they could, and the advance commenced. When the vanguard were well past the ambuscade,
Chabrias and his men sprang up from their hiding-place, and poured a volley of javelins and
stones upon the enemy. At the same moment the hoplites, who had disembarked, (9) were advancing,
so that the Spartan vanguard, in the absence of anything like collective action, were speedily
cut down, and among them fell Gorgopas with the Lacedaemonians. At their fall the rest of course
turned and fled. One hundred and fifty Aeginetans were numbered among the slain, while the
loss incurred by the foreigners, metics, and sailors who had joined the relief party, reached
a total of two hundred. After this the Athenians sailed the sea as freely as in the times of
actual peace. Nor would anything induce the sailors to row a single stroke for Eteonicus--even
under pressure--since he had no pay to give.

 (7) According to Diod. xiv. 92, Chabrias had been for some time in
    Corinth. See also above, IV. viii. 24.

 (8) Lit. "about sixteen stades."

 (9) Or, reading {oi anabebekotes}, "who had scaled the height." See
    Hartman, "Anal. Xen." p. 364.

Subsequently the Lacedaemonians despatched Teleutias once again to take command of the squadron,
and when the sailors saw it was he who had come, they were overjoyed. He summoned a meeting
and addressed them thus: "Soldiers, I am back again, but I bring with me no money. Yet if God
be willing, and your zeal flag not, I will endeavour to supply you with provisions without
stint. Be well assured, as often as I find myself in command of you, I have but one prayer--that
your lives may be spared no less than mine; and as for the necessaries of existence, perhaps
it would astonish you if I said I would rather you should have them than I. Yet by the gods
I swear I would welcome two days' starvation in order to spare you one. Was not my door open
in old days to every comer? Open again it shall stand now; and so it shall be; where your own
board overflows, you shall look in and mark the luxury of your general; but if at other times
you see him bearing up against cold and heat and sleepless nights, you must apply the lesson
to yourselves and study to endure those evils. I do not bid you do aught of this for self-mortification's
sake, but that you may derive some after-blessing from it. Soldiers, let Lacedaemon, our own
mother-city, be to you an example. Her good fortune is reputed to stand high. That you know;
and you know too, that she purchased her glory and her greatness not by faint-heartedness,
but by choosing to suffer pain and incur dangers in the day of need. 'Like city,' I say, 'like
citizens.' You, too, as I can bear you witness, have been in times past brave; but to-day must
we strive to be better than ourselves. So shall we share our pains without repining, and when
fortune smiles, mingle our joys; for indeed the sweetest thing of all surely is to flatter
no man, Hellene or Barbarian, for the sake of hire; we will suffice to ourselves, and from
a source to which honour pre-eminently invites us; since, I need not remind you, abundance
won from the enemy in war furnishes forth not bodily nutrition only, but a feast of glory the
wide world over."

So he spoke, and with one voice they all shouted to him to issue what orders he thought fit;
they would not fail him in willing service. The general's sacrifice was just concluded, and
he answered: "Good, then, my men; go now, as doubtless you were minded, and take your evening
meal, and next provide yourselves, please, with one day's food. After that repair to your ships
without delay, for we have a voyage on hand, whither God wills, and must arrive in time." So
then, when the men returned, he embarked them on their ships, and sailed under cover of night
for the great harbour of Piraeus: at one time he gave the rowers rest, passing the order to
take a snatch of sleep; at another he pushed forward towards his goal with rise and fall of
oars. If any one supposes that there was a touch of madness in such an expedition--with but
twelve triremes to attack an enemy possessed of a large fleet--he should consider the calculations
of Teleutias. He was under the firm persuasion that the Athenians were more careless than ever
about their navy in the harbour since the death of Gorgopas; and in case of finding warships
riding at anchor--even so, there was less danger, he conjectured, in attacking twenty ships
in the port of Athens than ten elsewhere; for, whereas, anywhere outside the harbour the sailors
would certainly be quartered on board, at Athens it was easy to divine that the captains and
officers would be sleeping at their homes, and the crews located here and there in different
quarters.

This minded he set sail, and when he was five or six furlongs (10) distant from the harbour
he lay on his oars and rested. But with the first streak of dawn he led the way, the rest following.
The admiral's orders to the crews were explicit. They were on no account to sink any merchant
vessel; they were equally to avoid damaging (11) their own vessels, but if at any point they
espied a warship at her moorings they must try and cripple her. The trading vessels, provided
they had got their cargoes on board, they must seize and tow out of the harbour; those of larger
tonnage they were to board wherever they could and capture the crews. Some of his men actually
jumped on to the Deigma quay, (12) where they seized hold of various traders and pilots and
deposited them bodily on board ship. So the Spartan admiral carried out his programme.

 (10) Lit. "five or six stades."

 (11) See Hartman, "Anal. Xen." pp. 365, 366.

 (12) See Grote ("H. G." ix. 523): cf. Thuc. ii. 94, the attempt of
    Brasidas on the port of Megara. For the wealth of Piraeus, Grote
    "H. G." ix. 351. See below, "Pol. Ath." i. 17; "Rev." iii. 13.

As to the Athenians, meanwhile, some of them who got wind of what was happening rushed from
indoors outside to see what the commotion meant, others from the streets home to get their
arms, and others again were off to the city with the news. The whole of Athens rallied to the
rescue at that instant, heavy infantry and cavalry alike, the apprehension being that Piraeus
was taken. But the Spartan sent off the captured vessels to Aegina, telling off three or four
of his triremes to convoy them thither; with the rest he followed along the coast of Attica,
and emerging in seemingly innocent fashion from the harbour, captured a number of fishing smacks,
and passage boats laden with passengers crossing to Piraeus from the islands; and finally,
on reaching Sunium he captured some merchantmen laden with corn or other merchandise. After
these performances he sailed back to Aegina, where he sold his prizes, and with the proceeds
was able to provide his troops with a month's pay, and for the future was free to cruise about
and make what reprisals chance cast in his way. By such a procedure he was able to support
a full quota of mariners on board his squadron, and procured to himself the prompt and enthusiastic
service of his troops.

B.C. 388-387. Antalcidas had now returned from the Persian court with Tiribazus. The negotiations
had been successful. He had secured the alliance of the Persian king and his military co-operation
in case the Athenians and their allies refused to abide by the peace which the king dictated.
But learning that his second in command, Nicolochus, was being blockaded with his fleet by
Iphicrates and Diotimus (13) in Abydos, he set off at once by land for that city. Being come
thither he took the fleet one night and put out to sea, having first spread a story that he
had invitations from a party in Calchedon; but as a matter of fact he came to anchorage in
Percote and there kept quiet. Meanwhile the Athenian forces under Demaenetus and Dionysius
and Leontichus and Phanias had got wind of his movement, and were in hot pursuit towards Proconnesus.
As soon as they were well past, the Spartan veered round and returned to Abydos, trusting to
information brought him of the approach of Polyxenus with the Syracusan (14) and Italian squadron
of twenty ships, which he wished to pick up and incorporate with his own.

 (13) See above; Lysias, "de bon. Arist." (Jebb, "Att. Or." i. p. 327).

 (14) See below, VI. ii. 4 foll; Hicks, 71, 84, 88.

A little later the Athenian Thrasybulus (15) (of Collytus) was making his way up with eight
ships from Thrace, his object being to effect a junction with the main Athenian squadron. The
scouts signalled the approach of eight triremes, whereupon Antalcidas, embarking his marines
on board twelve of the fastest sailers of his fleet, ordered them to make up their full complements,
where defective, from the remaining vessels; and so lay to, skulking in his lair with all possible
secrecy. As soon as the enemy's vessels came sailing past he gave chase; and they catching
sight of him took to flight. With his swiftest sailors he speedily overhauled their laggards,
and ordering his vanguard to let these alone, he followed hard on those ahead. But when the
foremost had fallen into his clutches, the enemy's hinder vessels, seeing their leaders taken
one by one, out of sheer despondency fell an easy prey to the slower sailors of the foe, so
that not one of the eight vessels escaped.

 (15) His name occurs on the famous stele of the new Athenian
    confederacy, B.C. 378. See Hicks, 81; Kohler, "C. I. A." ii. 17;
    Demos. "de. Cor." p. 301; Arist. "Rhet." ii. 23; Demos. "c.
    Timocr." 742.

Presently the Syracusan squadron of twenty vessels joined him, and again another squadron from
Ionia, or rather so much of that district as lay under the control of Tiribazus. The full quota
of the contingent was further made up from the territory of Ariobarzanes (which whom Antalcidas
kept up a friendship of long standing), in the absence of Pharnabazus, who by this date had
already been summoned up country on the occasion of his marriage with the king's daughter.
With this fleet, which, from whatever sources derived, amounted to more than eighty sail, Antalcidas
ruled the seas, and was in a position not only to cut off the passage of vessels bound to Athens
from the Euxine, but to convoy them into the harbours of Sparta's allies.

The Athenians could not but watch with alarm the growth of the enemy's fleet, and began to
fear a repetition of their former discomfiture. To be trampled under foot by the hostile power
seemed indeed no remote possibility, now that the Lacedaemonians had procured an ally in the
person of the Persian monarch, and they were in little less than a state of siege themselves,
pestered as they were by privateers from Aegina. On all these grounds the Athenians became
passionately desirous of peace. (16) The Lacedaemonians were equally out of humour with the
war for various reasons--what with their garrison duties, one mora at Lechaeum and another
at Orchomenus, and the necessity of keeping watch and ward on the states, if loyal not to lose
them, if disaffected to prevent their revolt; not to mention that reciprocity of annoyance
(17) of which Corinth was the centre. So again the Argives had a strong appetite for peace;
they knew that the ban had been called out against them, and, it was plain, that no fictitious
alteration of the calendar would any longer stand them in good stead. Hence, when Tiribazus
issued a summons calling on all who were willing to listen to the terms of peace sent down
by the king (18) to present themselves, the invitation was promptly accepted. At the opening
of the conclave (19) Tiribazus pointed to the king's seal attached to the document, and proceeded
to read the contents, which ran as follows:

 (16) See, at this point, Grote on the financial condition of Athens
    and the "Theorikon," "H. G." ix. 525.

 (17) Or, "that give-and-take of hard knocks."

 (18) See Hicks, 76.

 (19) At Sardis, doubtless.

"The king, Artaxerxes, deems it just that the cities in Asia, with the islands of Clazomenae
and Cyprus, should belong to himself; the rest of the Hellenic cities he thinks it just to
leave independent, both small and great, with the exception of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros,
which three are to belong to Athens as of yore. Should any of the parties concerned not accept
this peace, I, Artaxerxes, will war against him or them with those who share my views. This
will I do by land and by sea, with ships and with money."

After listening to the above declaration the ambassadors from the several states proceeded
to report the same to their respective governments. One and all of these took the oaths (20)
to ratify and confirm the terms unreservedly, with the exception of the Thebans, who claimed
to take the oaths in behalf of all Boeotians. This claim Agesilaus repudiated: unless they
chose to take the oaths in precise conformity with the words of the king's edict, which insisted
on "the future autonomy of each state, small or great," he would not admit them. To this the
Theban ambassadors made no other reply, except that the instructions they had received were
different. "Pray go, then," Agesilaus retorted, "and ask the question; and you may inform your
countrymen that if they will not comply, they will be excluded from the treaty." The Theban
ambassadors departed, but Agesilaus, out of hatred to the Thebans, took active measures at
once. Having got the consent of the ephors he forthwith offered sacrifice. The offerings for
crossing the frontier were propitious, and he pushed on to Tegea. From Tegea he despatched
some of the knights right and left to visit the perioeci and hasten their mobilisation, and
at the same time sent commanders of foreign brigades to the allied cities on a similar errand.
But before he had started from Tegea the answer from Thebes arrived; the point was yielded,
they would suffer the states to be independent. Under these circumstances the Lacedaemonians
returned home, and the Thebans were forced to accept the truce unconditionally, and to recognise
the autonomy of the Boeotian cities. (21) But now the Corinthians were by no means disposed
to part with the garrison of the Argives. Accordingly Agesilaus had a word of warning for both.
To the former he said, "if they did not forthwith dismiss the Argives," and to the latter,
"if they did not instantly quit Corinth," he would march an army into their territories. The
terror of both was so great that the Argives marched out of Corinth, and Corinth was once again
left to herself; (22) whereupon the "butchers" (23) and their accomplices in the deed of blood
determined to retire from Corinth, and the rest of the citizens welcomed back their late exiles
voluntarily.

Now that the transactions were complete, and the states were bound by their oaths to abide
by the peace sent down to them by the king, the immediate result was a general disarmament,
military and naval forces being alike disbanded; and so it was that the Lacedaemonians and
Athenians, with their allies, found themselves in the enjoyment of peace for the first time
since the period of hostilities subsequent to the demolition of the walls of Athens. From a
condition which, during the war, can only be described as a sort of even balance with their
antagonists, the Lacedaemonians now emerged; and reached a pinnacle of glory consequent upon
the Peace of Antalcidas, (24) so called. As guarantors of the peace presented by Hellas to
the king, and as administrators personally of the autonomy of the states, they had added Corinth
to their alliance; they had obtained the independence of the states of Boeotia at the expense
of Thebes, (25) which meant the gratification of an old ambition; and lastly, by calling out
the ban in case the Argives refused to evacuate Corinth, they had put a stop to the appropriation
of that city by the Argives.

 (24) Or, more correctly, the peace "under," or "at the date of," {ep
    'Antalkidou}. See Grote, "H. G." x. 1, note 1.

B.C. 386. Indeed the late events had so entirely shaped themselves in conformity with the wishes
of the Lacedaemonians, that they determined to go a step farther and chastise those of their
allies who either had borne hard on them during the war, or otherwise had shown themselves
less favourable to Lacedaemon than to her enemies. (1) Chastisement was not all; they must
lay down such secure foundations for the future as should render the like disloyalty impossible
again. (2) As the first step towards this policy they sent a dictatorial message to the Mantinaeans,
and bade them raze their fortifications, on the sole ground that they could not otherwise trust
them not to side with their enemies. Many things in their conduct, they alleged, from time
to time, had not escaped their notice: their frequent despatches of corn to the Argives while
at war with Lacedaemon; at other times their refusal to furnish contingents during a campaign,
on the pretext of some holy truce or other; (3) or if they did reluctantly take the field--the
miserable inefficiency of their service. "But, more than that," they added, "we note the jealousy
with which you eye any good fortune which may betide our state; the extravagant pleasure (4)
you exhibit at the sudden descent of some disaster."

 (1) See Hartman, "An. Xen." p. 367 foll.; Busolt, "Die Lak." p. 129
    foll.

 (2) Or, "they determined to chastise... and reduce to such order
    that disloyalty should be impossible."

 (3) See above, "Hell." IV. ii. 16.

 (4) Ib. IV. v. 18.

This very year, moreover, it was commonly said, (5) saw the expiration, as far as the Mantineans
were concerned, of the thirty years' truce, consequent upon the battle of Mantinea. On their
refusal, therefore, to raze their fortification walls the ban was called out against them.
Agesilaus begged the state to absolve him from the conduct of this war on the plea that the
city of Mantinea had done frequent service to his father (6) in his Messenian wars. Accordingly
Agesipolis led the expedition--in spite of the cordial relations of his father Pausanias (7)
with the leaders of the popular party in Mantinea.

 (5) As to this point, see Curtius, "H. G." V. v. (iv. 305 note, Eng.
    trans.) There appears to be some confusion. According to Thuc. v.
    81, "When the Argives deserted the alliance  (with Mantinea,
    Athens, and Elis, making a new treaty of alliance with Lacedaemon
    for fifty years) the Mantineans held out for a time, but without
    the Argives they were helpless, and so they came to terms with the
    Lacedaemonians, and gave up their claims to supremacy over the
    cities in Arcadia, which had been subject to them.... These
    changes were effected at the close of winter  (418 B.C.) towards
    the approach of spring  (417 B.C.), and so ended the fourteenth
    year of the war." Jowett. According to Diod. xv. 5, the
    Lacedaemonians attacked Mantinea within two years after the Peace
    of Antalcidas, apparently in 386 B.C. According to Thuc. v. 82,
    and "C. I. A. 50, in B.C. 417 Argos had reverted to her alliance
    with Athens, and an attempt to connect the city with the sea by
    long walls was made, certain other states in Peloponnese being
    privy to the project" (Thuc. v. 83)--an attempt frustrated by
    Lacedaemon early in B.C. 416. Is it possible that a treaty of
    alliance between Mantinea and Lacedaemon for thirty years was
    formally signed in B.C. 416?

 (6) I.e. Archidamus.

 (7) See above, "Hell." III. v. 25.

B.C. 385. The first move of the invader was to subject the enemy's territory to devastation;
but failing by such means to induce them to raze their walls, he proceeded to draw lines of
circumvallation round the city, keeping half his troops under arms to screen the entrenching
parties whilst the other half pushed on the work with the spade. As soon as the trench was
completed, he experienced no further difficulty in building a wall round the city. Aware, however,
of the existence of a huge supply of corn inside the town, the result of the bountiful harvest
of the preceding year, and averse to the notion of wearing out the city of Lacedaemon and her
allies by tedious campaigning, he hit upon the expedient of damming up the river which flowed
through the town.

It was a stream of no inconsiderable size. (8) By erecting a barrier at its exit from the town
he caused the water to rise above the basements of the private dwellings and the foundations
of the fortification walls. Then, as the lower layers of bricks became saturated and refused
their support to the rows above, the wall began to crack and soon to totter to its fall. The
citizens for some time tried to prop it with pieces of timber, and used other devices to avert
the imminent ruin of their tower; but finding themselves overmatched by the water, and in dread
lest the fall at some point or other of the circular wall (9) might deliver them captive to
the spear of the enemy, they signified their consent to raze their walls. But the Lacedaemonians
now steadily refused any form of truce, except on the further condition that the Mantineans
would suffer themselves to be broken up and distributed into villages. They, looking the necessity
in the face, consented to do even that. The sympathisers with Argos among them, and the leaders
of their democracy, thought their fate was sealed. Then the father treated with the son, Pausanias
with Agesipolis, on their behalf, and obtained immunity for them--sixty in number--on condition
that they should quit the city. The Lacedaemonian troops stood lining the road on both sides,
beginning from the gates, and watched the outgoers; and with their spears in their hands, in
spite of bitter hatred, kept aloof from them with less difficulty than the Mantineans of the
better classes themselves--a weighty testimony to the power of Spartan discipline, be it said.
In conclusion, the wall was razed, and Mantinea split up into four parts, (10) assuming once
again its primitive condition as regards inhabitants. The first feeling was one of annoyance
at the necessity of pulling down their present houses and erecting others, yet when the owners
(11) found themselves located so much nearer their estates round about the villages, in the
full enjoyment of aristocracy, and rid for ever of "those troublesome demagogues," they were
delighted with the turn which affairs had taken. It became the custom for Sparta to send them,
not one commander of contingents, (12) but four, one for each village; and the zeal displayed,
now that the quotas for military service were furnished from the several village centres, was
far greater than it had been under the democratic system. So the transactions in connection
with Mantinea were brought to a conclusion, and thereby one lesson of wisdom was taught mankind--not
to conduct a river through a fortress town.

B.C. 384-383. To pass on. The party in exile from Phlius, seeing the severe scrutiny to which
the behaviour of the allies of Lacedaemon during the late war was being subjected, felt that
their opportunity had come. They repaired to Lacedaemon, and laid great emphasis on the fact
that, so long as they had been in power themselves at home, "their city used to welcome Lacedaemonians
within her walls, and her citizens flocked to the campaign under their leadership; but no sooner
had they been driven into exile than a change had come. The men of Phlius now flatly refused
to follow Lacedaemon anywhere; the Lacedaemonians, alone of all men living, must not be admitted
within their gates." After listening to their story, the ephors agreed that the matter demanded
attention. Then they sent to the state of Phlius a message to this effect; the Phliasian exiles
were friends of Lacedaemon; nor did it appear that they owed their exile to any misdoing. Under
the circumstances, Lacedaemon claimed their recall from banishment, not by force, but as a
concession voluntarily granted. When the matter was thus stated, the Phliasians were not without
alarm that an army might much upon Phlius, and a party inside the town might admit the enemy
within the walls; for within the walls of Phlius were to be found many who, either as blood
relations or for other reasons, were partisans of the exiles, and as so often happens, at any
rate in the majority of states, there was a revolutionary party who, in their ardour to reform,
would welcome gladly their restoration. Owing to fears of this character, a formal decree was
passed: to welcome home the exiles, and to restore to them all undisputed property, the purchasers
of the same being indemnified from the treasury of the state; and in the event of any ambiguity
or question arising between the parties, the same to be determined before a court of justice.
Such was the position of affairs in connection with the Phliasian exiles at the date in question.

B.C. 383. (13) And now from yet another quarter ambassadors arrived at Lacedaemon: that is
to say, from Acanthus and Apollonia, the two largest and most important states of the Olynthian
confederacy. The ephorate, after learning from them the object of their visit, presented them
to the assembly and the allies, in presence of whom Cleigenes of Acanthus made a speech to
this effect:

 (13) Al. B.C. 382.

"Men of Lacedaemon and of the allied states," he said, "are you aware of a silent but portentous
growth within the bosom of Hellas? (14) Few here need to be told that for size and importance
Olynthus now stands at the head of the Thracian cities. But are you aware that the citizens
of Olynthus had already brought over several states by the bribe of joint citizenship and common
laws; that they have forcibly annexed some of the larger states; and that, so encouraged, they
have taken in hand further to free the cities of Macedonia from Amyntas the king of the Macedonians;
that, as soon as their immediate neighbours had shown compliance, they at once proceeded to
attack larger and more distant communities; so much so, that when we started to come hither,
we left them masters not only of many other places, but of Pella itself, the capital of Macedonia.
Amyntas, (15) we saw plainly, must ere long withdraw from his cities, and was in fact already
all but in name an outcast from Macedonia.

 (14) Or, "are you aware of a new power growing up in Hellas?"

 (15) For Amyntas's reign, see Diod. xiv. 89, 92; xv. 19; Isocr.
    "Panegyr." 126, "Archid." 46.

"The Olynthians have actually sent to ourselves and to the men of Apollonia a joint embassy,
warning us of their intention to attack us if we refuse to present ourselves at Olynthus with
a military contingent. Now, for our parts, men of Lacedaemon, we desire nothing better than
to abide by our ancestral laws and institutions, to be free and independent citizens; but if
aid from without is going to fail us, we too must follow the rest and coalesce with the Olynthians.
Why, even now they muster no less than eight hundred (16) heavy infantry and a considerably
larger body of light infantry, while their cavalry, when we have joined them, will exceed one
thousand men. At the date of our departure we left embassies from Athens and Boeotia in Olynthus,
and we were told that the Olynthians themselves had passed a formal resolution to return the
compliment. They were to send an embassy on their side to the aforesaid states to treat of
an alliance. And yet, if the power of the Athenians and the Thebans is to be further increased
by such an accession of strength, look to it," the speaker added, "whether hereafter you will
find things so easy to manage in that quarter.

 (16) See Grote, "H. G." x. 72; Thirlwall, "H. G." v. 12 (ch. xxxvii).

"They hold Potidaea, the key to the isthmus of Pallene, and therefore, you can well believe,
they can command the states within that peninsula. If you want any further proof of the abject
terror of those states, you have it in the fact that notwithstanding the bitter hatred which
they bear to Olynthus, not one of them has dared to send ambassadors along with us to apprise
you of these matters.

"Reflect, how you can reconcile your anxiety to prevent the unification of Boeotia with your
neglect to hinder the solidifying of a far larger power--a power destined, moreover, to become
formidable not on land only, but by sea? For what is to stop it, when the soil itself supplies
timber for shipbuilding, (17) and there are rich revenues derived from numerous harbours and
commercial centres?--it cannot but be that abundance of food and abundance of population will
go hand in hand. Nor have we yet reached the limits of Olynthian expansion; there are their
neighbours to be thought of--the kingless or independent Thracians. These are already to-day
the devoted servants of Olynthus, and when it comes to their being actually under her, that
means at once another vast accession of strength to her. With the Thracians in her train, the
gold mines of Pangaeus would stretch out to her the hand of welcome.

 (17) See Hicks, 74, for a treaty between Amyntas and the Chalcidians,
    B.C. 390-389: "The article of the treaty between Amyntas III.,
    father of Philip, and the Chalcidians, about timber, etc., reminds
    us that South Macedonia, the Chalcidic peninsula, and Amphipolis
    were the chief sources whence Athens derived timber for her
    dockyards." Thuc. iv. 108; Diod. xx. 46; Boeckh, "P. E. A." p.
    250; and for a treaty between Athens and Amyntas, B.C. 382, see
    Hicks, 77; Kohler, "C. I. A." ii. 397, 423.

"In making these assertions, we are but uttering remarks ten thousand times repeated in the
democracy of Olynthus. And as to their confident spirit, who shall attempt to describe it?
It is God, for aught I know, who, with the growth of a new capacity, gives increase also to
the proud thoughts and vast designs of humanity. For ourselves, men of Lacedaemon and of the
allied states, our task is completed. We have played our parts in announcing to you how things
stand there. To you it is left to determine whether what we have described is worthy of your
concern. One only thing further you ought to recognise: the power we have spoken of as great
is not as yet invincible, for those states which are involuntary participants in the citizenship
of Olynthus will, in prospect of any rival power appearing in the field, speedily fall away.
On the contrary, let them be once closely knit and welded together by the privileges of intermarriage
and reciprocal rights of holding property in land--which have already become enactments; let
them discover that it is a gain to them to follow in the wake of conquerors (just as the Arcadians,
(18) for instance, find it profitable to march in your ranks, whereby they save their own property
and pillage their neighbours'); let these things come to pass, and perhaps you may find the
knot no longer so easy to unloose."

 (18) For the point of the comparison, see Freeman, "Hist. Fed. Gov."
    ch. iv. "Real nature of the Olynthian scheme," pp. 190 foll., and
    note 2, p. 197; also Grote, "H. G." x. 67 foll., 278 foll.

At the conclusion of this address, the Lacedaemonians requested the allies to speak, bidding
them give their joint advice as to the best course to be pursued in the interests of Peloponnese
and the allies. Thereupon many members, and especially those who wished to gratify the Lacedaemonians,
agreed in counselling active measures; and it was resolved that the states should severally
send contingents to form a total of ten thousand men. Proposals were also made to allow any
state, so wishing, to give money instead of men, at the rate of three Aeginetan obols (19)
a day per man; or where the contingent consisted of cavalry, the pay given for one horseman
was to be the equivalent to that of four hoplites; while, in the event of any defaulting in
service, the Lacedaemonians should be allowed to mulct the said state of a stater per man per
diem. These resolutions were passed, and the deputies from Acanthus rose again. They argued
that, though excellent, these resolutions were not of a nature to be rapidly carried into effect.
Would it not be better, they asked, pending the mobilisation of the troops, to despatch an
officer at once in command of a force from Lacedaemon and the other states, not too large to
start immediately. The effect would be instantaneous, for the states which had not yet given
in their adhesion to Olynthus would be brought to a standstill, and those already forcibly
enrolled would be shaken in their alliance. These further resolutions being also passed, the
Lacedaemonians despatched Eudamidas, accompanied by a body of neodamodes, with perioeci and
Sciritae, (20) to the number of two thousand odd. Eudamidas lost no time in setting out, having
obtained leave from the ephors for his brother Phoebidas to follow later with the remainder
of the troops assigned to him. Pushing on himself to the Thracian territory, he set about despatching
garrisons to various cities at their request. He also secured the voluntary adhesion of Potidaea,
although already a member of the Olynthian alliance; and this town now served as his base of
operations for carrying on war on a scale adapted to his somewhat limited armament.

 (19) I.e. "rather more than sixpence a day for a hoplite, and two
    shillings for a horseman." "The Aeginetan stater weighed about 196
    grains, rather more than two of our shillings, and was divided
    into two drachms of 98 grains, each of which contained six obols
    of about 16 grains each." See Percy Gardner, "Types of Greek
    Coins," "Hist. Int." p. 8; Jowett, note to Thuc. III. lxx. 4, vol.
    i. pp. 201, 202.

 (20) Or, "new citizens, provincials, and Sciritae."

Phoebidas, when the remaining portion of his brother's forces was duly mustered, put himself
at their head and commenced his march. On reaching Thebes the troops encamped outside the city,
round the gymnasium. Faction was rife within the city. The two polemarchs in office, Ismenias
and Leontiades, were diametrically opposed, (21) being the respective heads of antagonistic
political clubs. Hence it was that, while Ismenias, ever inspired by hatred to the Lacedaemonians,
would not come anywhere near the Spartan general, Leontiades, on the other hand, was assiduous
in courting him; and when a sufficient intimacy was established between them, he made a proposal
as follows: "You have it in your power," he said, addressing Phoebidas, "this very day to confer
supreme benefit on your country. Follow me with your hoplites, and I will introduce you into
the citadel. That done, you may rest assured Thebes will be completely under the thumb of Lacedaemon
and of us, your friends. At present, as you see, there is a proclamation forbidding any Theban
to take service with you against Olynthus, but we will change all that. You have only to act
with us as we suggest, and we shall at once be able to furnish you with large supplies of infantry
and cavalry, so that you will join your brother with a magnificent reinforcement, and pending
his proposed reduction of Olynthus, you will have accomplished the reduction of a far larger
state than that--to wit, this city of Thebes."

 (21) See Grote, "H. G." vol. x. p. 80: "We have little or no
    information respecting the government of Thebes," etc. The "locus
    classicus" seems to be Plut. "de Genio Socratis." See Freeman, op.
    cit. ch. iv. S. 2, "Of the Boeotian League," pp. 154-184; and, in
    reference to the seizure of the Kadmeia, p. 170.

The imagination of Phoebidas was kindled as he listened to the tempting proposal. To do a brilliant
deed was far dearer to him than life; (22) on the other hand, he had no reasoning capacity,
and would seem to have been deficient altogether in sound sense. The consent of the Spartan
secured, Leontiades bade him set his troops in motion, as if everything were ready for his
departure. "And anon, when the hour is come," added the Theban, "I will be with you, and show
you the way myself."

 (22) Or, "Renown was his mistress." See Grote, "H. G." x. 84.

The senate was seated in the arcade or stoa in the market-place, since the Cadmeia was in possession
of the women who were celebrating the Thesmophoria. (23) It was noon of a hot summer's day;
scarcely a soul was stirring in the streets. This was the moment for Leontiades. He mounted
on horseback and galloped off to overtake Phoebidas. He turned him back, and led him without
further delay into the acropolis. Having posted Phoebidas and his soldiers inside, he handed
him the key of the gates, and warning him not to suffer any one to enter into the citadel without
a pass from himself, he straightway betook himself to the senate. Arrived there, he delivered
himself thus: "Sirs, the Lacedaemonians are in possession of the citadel; but that is no cause
for despondency, since, as they assure us, they have no hostile intention, except, indeed,
towards any one who has an appetite for war. For myself, and acting in obedience to the law,
which empowers the polemarch to apprehend all persons suspected of capital crimes, I hereby
seize the person of Ismenias as an arch-fomenter of war. I call upon you, sirs, who are captains
of companies, and you who are ranked with them, to do your duty. Arise and secure the prisoner,
and lead him away to the place appointed."

 (23) An ancient festival held by women in honour of Demeter and
    Persephone ({to Thesmophoro}), who gave the first impulse to civil
    society, lawful marriage, etc. See Herod. ii. 171; Diod. v. 5.

Those who were privy to the affair, it will be understood, presented themselves, and the orders
were promptly carried out. Of those not in the secret, but opposed to the party of Leontiades,
some sought refuge at once outside the city in terror for their lives; whilst the rest, albeit
they retired to their houses at first, yet when they found that Ismenias was imprisoned in
the Cadmeia, and further delay seemed dangerous, retreated to Athens. These were the men who
shared the views of Androcleidas and Ismenias, and they must have numbered about three hundred.

Now that the transactions were concluded, another polemarch was chosen in place of Ismenias,
and Leontiades at once set out to Lacedaemon. There he found the ephors and the mass of the
community highly incensed against Phoebidas, "who had failed to execute the orders assigned
to him by the state." Against this general indignation, however, Agesilaus protested. (24)
If mischief had been wrought to Lacedaemon by this deed, it was just that the doer of it should
be punished; but, if good, it was a time-honoured custom to allow full scope for impromptu
acts of this character. "The sole point you have to look to," he urged, "is whether what has
been done is good or evil." After this, however, Leontiades presented himself to the assembly
(25) and addressed the members as follows: "Sirs, Lacedaemonians, the hostile attitude of Thebes
towards you, before the occurrence of late events, was a topic constantly on your lips, since
time upon time your eyes were called upon to witness her friendly bearing to your foes in contrast
with her hatred of your friends. Can it be denied that Thebes refused to take part with you
in the campaign against your direst enemy, the democracy in Piraeus; and balanced that lukewarmness
by on onslaught on the Phocians, whose sole crime was cordiality to yourselves? (26) Nor is
that all. In full knowledge that you were likely to be engaged in war with Olynthus, she proceeded
at once to make an alliance with that city. So that up to the last moment you were in constant
expectation of hearing that the whole of Boeotia was laid at the feet of Thebes. With the late
incidents all is changed. You need fear Thebes no longer. One brief despatch (27) in cipher
will suffice to procure a dutiful subservience to your every wish in that quarter, provided
only you will take as kindly an interest in us as we in you."

 (25) "Select Committee." See "Hell." II. iv. 38; and below, VI. iii.

 (26) See above, "Hell." III. v. 4.

 (27) Lit. "scytale."

This appeal told upon the meeting, and the Lacedaemonians (28) resolved formally, now that
the citadel had been taken, to keep it, and to put Ismenias on his trial. In consequence of
this resolution a body of commissioners (29) was despatched, three Lacedaemonians and one for
each of the allied states, great and small alike. The court of inquiry thus constituted, the
sittings commenced, and an indictment was preferred against Ismenias. He was accused of playing
into the hands of the barbarian; of seeking amity with the Persians to the detriment of Hellas;
of accepting sums of money as bribes from the king; and, finally, of being, along with Androcleidas,
the prime cause of the whole intestine trouble to which Hellas was a prey. Each of these charges
was met by the defendant, but to no purpose, since he failed to disabuse the court of their
conviction that the grandeur of his designs was only equalled by their wickedness. (30) The
verdict was given against him, and he was put to death. The party of Leontiades thus possessed
the city; and went beyond the injunctions given them in the eager performance of their services.

B.C. 382. As a result of these transactions the Lacedaemonians pressed on the combined campaign
against Olynthus with still greater enthusiasm. They not only set out Teleutias as governor,
but by their united efforts furnished him with an aggregate army of ten thousand men. (31)
They also sent despatches to the allied states, calling upon them to support Teleutias in accordance
with the resolution of the allies. All the states were ready to display devotion to Teleutias,
and to do him service, since he was a man who never forgot a service rendered him. Nor was
Thebes an exception; for was not the governor a brother of Agesilaus? Thebes, therefore, was
enthusiastic in sending her contribution of heavy infantry and cavalry. The Spartan conducted
his march slowly and surely, taking the utmost pains to avoid injuring his friends, and to
collect as large a force as possible. He also sent a message in advance to Amyntas, begging
him, if he were truly desirous of recovering his empire, to raise a body of mercenaries, and
to distribute sums of money among the neighbouring kings with a view to their alliance. Nor
was that all. He sent also to Derdas, the ruler of Elimia, pointing out to him that the Olynthians,
having laid at their feet the great power of Macedonia, would certainly not suffer his lesser
power to escape unless they were stayed up by force in arms in their career of insolence. Proceeding
thus, by the time he had reached the territory of the allied powers he was at the head of a
very considerable army. At Potidaea he halted to make the necessary disposition of his troops,
and thence advanced into the territory of the enemy. As he approached the hostile city, he
abstained from felling and firing alike, being persuaded that to do so was only to create difficulties
in his own path, whether advancing or retreating; it would be time enough, when he retired
from Olynthus, to fell the trees and lay them as a barrier in the path of any assailant in
the rear.

 (31) Lit. "sent out along with him the combined force of ten thousand
    men," in ref to S. 20 above.

Being now within a mile or so (32) of the city he came to a halt. The left division was under
his personal command, for it suited him to advance in a line opposite the gate from which the
enemy sallied; the other division of the allies stretched away to the right. The cavalry were
thus distributed: the Laconians, Thebans, and all the Macedonians present were posted on the
right. With his own division he kept Derdas and his troopers, four hundred strong. This he
did partly out of genuine admiration for this body of horse, and partly as a mark of courtesy
to Derdas, which should make him not regret his coming.

 (32) Lit. "ten stades."

Presently the enemy issued forth and formed in line opposite, under cover of their walls. Then
their cavalry formed in close order and commenced the attack. Dashing down upon the Laconians
and Boeotians they dismounted Polycharmus, the Lacedaemonian cavalry general, inflicting a
hundred wounds on him as he lay on the ground, and cut down others, and finally put to flight
the cavalry on the right wing. The flight of these troopers infected the infantry in close
proximity to them, who in turn swerved; and it looked as if the whole army was about to be
worsted, when Derdas at the head of his cavalry dashed straight at the gates of Olynthus, Teleutias
supporting him with the troops of his division. The Olynthian cavalry, seeing how matters were
going, and in dread of finding the gates closed upon them, wheeled round and retired with alacrity.
Thus it was that Derdas had his chance to cut down man after man as their cavalry ran the gauntlet
past him. In the same way, too, the infantry of the Olynthians retreated within their city,
though, owing to the closeness of the walls in their case, their loss was trifling. Teleutias
claimed the victory, and a trophy was duly erected, after which he turned his back on Olynthus
and devoted himself to felling the fruit-trees. This was the campaign of the summer. He now
dismissed both the Macedonians and the cavalry force of Derdas. Incursions, however, on the
part of the Olynthians themselves against the states allied to Lacedaemon were frequent; lands
were pillaged, and people put to the sword.

III

B.C. 381. With the first symptoms of approaching spring the Olynthian cavalry, six hundred
strong, had swooped into the territory of Apollonia--about the middle of the day--and dispersing
over the district, were employed in pillaging; but as luck would have it, Derdas had arrived
that day with his troopers, and was breakfasting in Apollonia. He noted the enemy's incursion,
but kept quiet, biding his time; his horses were ready saddled, and his troopers armed cap-a-pied.
As the Olynthians came galloping up contemptuously, not only into the suburbs, but to the very
gates of the city, he seized his opportunity, and with his compact and well-ordered squadron
dashed out; whereupon the invaders took to flight. Having once turned them, Derdas gave them
no respite, pursuing and slaughtering them for ten miles or more, (1) until he had driven them
for shelter within the very ramparts of Olynthus. Report said that Derdas slew something like
eighty men in this affair. After this the Olynthians were more disposed to keep to their walls,
contenting themselves with tilling the merest corner of their territory.

 (1) Lit. "ninety stades."

Time advanced, and Teleutias was in conduct of another expedition against the city of Olynthus.
His object was to destroy any timber (2) still left standing, or fields still cultivated in
the hostile territory. This brought out the Olynthian cavalry, who, stealthily advancing, crossed
the river which washes the walls of the town, and again continued their silent march right
up to the adversary's camp. At sight of an audacity which nettled him, Teleutias at once ordered
Tlemonidas, the officer commanding his light infantry division, to charge the assailants at
the run. On their side the men of Olynthus, seeing the rapid approach of the light infantry,
wheeled and quietly retired until they had recrossed the river, drawing the enemy on, who followed
with conspicuous hardihood. Arrogating to themselves the position of pursuers towards fugitives,
they did not hesitate to cross the river which stood between them and their prey. Then the
Olynthian cavalry, choosing a favourable moment, when those who had crossed seemed easy to
deal with, wheeled and attacked them, putting Tlemonidas himself to the sword with more than
a hundred others of his company. Teleutias, when he saw what was happening, snatched up his
arms in a fit of anger and began leading his hoplites swiftly forward, ordering at the same
time his peltasts and cavalry to give chase and not to slacken. Their fate was the fate of
many before and since, who, in the ardour of pursuit, have come too close to the enemy's walls
and found it hard to get back again. Under a hail of missiles from the walls they were forced
to retire in disorder and with the necessity of guarding themselves against the missiles. At
this juncture the Olynthians sent out their cavalry at full gallop, backed by supports of light
infantry; and finally their heavy infantry reserves poured out and fell upon the enemy's lines,
now in thorough confusion. Here Teleutias fell fighting, and when that happened, without further
pause the troops immediately about him swerved. Not one soul longer cared to make a stand,
but the flight became general, some fleeing towards Spartolus, others in the direction of Acanthus,
a third set seeking refuge within the walls of Apollonia, and the majority within those of
Potidaea. As the tide of fugitives broke into several streams, so also the pursuers divided
the work between them; this way and that they poured, dealing death wholesale. So perished
the pith and kernel of the armament.

 (2) I.e. fruit-trees.

Such calamities are not indeed without a moral. The lesson they are meant to teach mankind,
I think, is plain. If in a general sense one ought not to punish any one, even one's own slave,
in anger--since the master in his wrath may easily incur worse evil himself than he inflicts--so,
in the case of antagonists in war, to attack an enemy under the influence of passion rather
than of judgment is an absolute error. For wrath is but a blind impulse devoid of foresight,
whereas to the penetrating eye of reason a blow parried may be better than a wound inflicted. (3)

 (3) See, for the same sentiment, "Horsemanship," vi. 13. See also
    Plut. "Pel." and "Marc." (Clough, ii. p. 278).

When the news of what had happened reached Lacedaemon it was agreed, after due deliberation,
that a force should be sent, and of no trifling description, if only to quench the victors'
pride, and to prevent their own achievements from becoming null and void. In this determination
they sent out King Agesipolis, as general, attended, like Agesilaus (4) on his Asiatic campaign,
by thirty Spartans. (5) Volunteers flocked to his standard. They were partly the pick and flower
of the provincials, (6) partly foreigners of the class called Trophimoi, (7) or lastly, bastard
sons of Spartans, comely and beautiful of limb, and well versed in the lore of Spartan chivalry.
The ranks of this invading force were further swelled by volunteers from the allied states,
the Thessalians notably contributing a corps of cavalry. All were animated by the desire of
becoming known to Agesipolis, so that even Amyntas and Derdas in zeal of service outdid themselves.
With this promise of success Agesipolis marched forward against Olynthus.

 (4) See above, "Hell." III. iv. 2.

 (5) Lit. "Spartiates." The new army was sent out B.C. 380, according
    to Grote.

 (6) Lit. "beautiful and brave of the Perioeci."

 (7) Xenophon's own sons educated at Sparta would belong to this class.
    See Grote, "H. G." x. 91.

Meanwhile the state of Phlius, complimented by Agesipolis on the amount of the funds contributed
by them to his expedition and the celerity with which the money had been raised, and in full
belief that while one king was in the field they were secure against the hostile attack of
the other (since it was hardly to be expected that both kings should be absent from Sparta
at one moment), boldly desisted from doing justice by her lately reinstated citizens. On the
one hand, these exiles claimed that points in dispute should be determined before an impartial
court of justice; the citizens, on the other, insisted on the claimants submitting the cases
for trial in the city itself. And when the latter demurred to that solution, asking "What sort
of trial that would be where the offenders were also the judges?" they appealed to deaf ears.
Consequently the restored party appealed at Sparta, to prefer a complaint against their city.
They were accompanied by other members of the community, who stated that many of the Phliasians
themselves besides the appellants recognised the injustice of their treatment. The state of
Phlius was indignant at this manouvre, and retaliated by imposing a fine on all who had betaken
themselves to Lacedaemon without a mandate from the state. Those who incurred the fine hesitated
to return home; they preferred to stay where they were and enforce their views: "It is quite
plain now who were the perpetrators of all the violence--the very people who originally drove
us into exile, and shut their gates upon Lacedaemon; the confiscators of our property one day,
the ruthless opponents of its restoration the next. Who else but they have now brought it about
that we should be fined for appearing at Lacedaemon? and for what purpose but to deter any
one else for the future from venturing to expose the proceedings at Phlius?" Thus far the appellants.
And in good sooth the conduct of the men of Phlius did seem to savour of insolence; so much
so that the ephors called out the ban against them.

B.C. 380. Nor was Agesilaus otherwise than well satisfied with this decision, not only on the
ground of old relations of friendly hospitality between his father Archidamus and the party
of Podanemus, who were numbered among the restored exiles at this time, but because personally
he was bound by similar ties himself towards the adherents of Procles, son of Hipponicus. The
border sacrifices proving favourable, the march commenced at once. As he advanced, embassy
after embassy met him, and would fain by presents of money avert invasion. But the king answered
that the purpose of his march was not to commit wrongdoing, but to protect the victims of injustice.
Then the petitioners offered to do anything, only they begged him to forgo invasion. Again
he replied--How could he trust to their words when they had lied to him already? He must have
the warrant of acts, not promises. And being asked, "What act (would satisfy him)?" he answered
once more, saying, "The same which you performed aforetime, and suffered no wrong at our hands"--in
other words, the surrender of the acropolis. (8) But to this they could not bring themselves.
Whereupon he invaded the territory of Phlius, and promptly drawing lines of circumvallation,
commenced the siege. Many of the Lacedaemonians objected, for the sake of a mere handful of
wretched people, so to embroil themselves with a state of over five thousand men. (9) For,
indeed, to leave no doubt on this score, the men of Phlius met regularly in assembly in full
view of those outside. But Agesilaus was not to be beaten by this move. Whenever any of the
townsmen came out, drawn by friendship or kinship with the exiles, in every case the king's
instructions were to place the public messes (10) at the service of the visitors, and, if they
were willing to go through the course of gymnastic training, to give them enough to procure
necessaries. All members of these classes were, by the general's strict injunctions, further
to be provided with arms, and loans were to be raised for the purpose without delay. Presently
the superintendents of this branch of the service were able to turn out a detachment of over
a thousand men, in the prime of bodily perfection, well disciplined and splendidly armed, so
that in the end the Lacedaemonians affirmed: "Fellow-soldiers of this stamp are too good to
lose." Such were the concerns of Agesilaus.

 (8) See above, IV. iv. 15.

 (9) See Grote, "H. G." x. 45, note 4; and below, V. iv. 13.

 (10) See "Pol. Lac." v.

Meanwhile Agesipolis on leaving Macedonia advanced straight upon Olynthus and took up a strategical
position in front of the town. Finding that no one came out to oppose him, he occupied himself
for the present with pillaging any remnant of the district till intact, and with marching into
the territory allied with the enemy, where he destroyed the corn. The town of Torone he attacked
and took by storm. But while he was so engaged, in the height of mid-summer he was attacked
by a burning fever. In this condition his mind reverted to a scene once visited, the temple
of Dionysus at Aphytis, and a longing for its cool and sparkling waters and embowered shades
(11) seized him. To this spot accordingly he was carried, still living, but only to breathe
his last outside the sacred shrine, within a week of the day on which he sickened. His body
was laid in honey and conveyed home to Sparta, where he obtained royal sepulchre.

 (11) Lit. "shady tabernacles."

When the news reached Agesilaus he displayed none of the satisfaction which might possibly
have been expected at the removal of an antagonist. On the contrary, he wept and pined for
the companionship so severed, it being the fashion at Sparta for the kings when at home to
mess together and to share the same quarters. Moreover, Agesipolis was admirably suited to
Agesilaus, sharing with the merriment of youth in tales of the chase and horsemanship and boyish
loves; (12) while, to crown all, the touch of reverence due from younger to elder was not wanting
in their common life. In place of Agesipolis, the Lacedaemonians despatched Polybiades as governor
to Olynthus.

 (12) See "Ages." viii. 2.

B.C. 379. Agesilaus had already exceeded the time during which the supplies of food in Phlius
were expected to last. The difference, in fact, between self-command and mere appetite is so
great that the men of Phlius had only to pass a resolution to cut down the food expenditure
by one half, and by doing so were able to prolong the siege for twice the calculated period.
But if the contrast between self-restraint and appetite is so great, no less startling is that
between boldness and faint-heartedness. A Phliasian named Delphion, a real hero, it would seem,
took to himself three hundred Phliasians, and not only succeeded in preventing the peace-party
from carrying out their wishes, but was equal to the task of incarcerating and keeping safely
under lock and key those whom he mistrusted. Nor did his ability end there. He succeeded in
forcing the mob of citizens to perform garrison duty, and by vigorous patrolling kept them
constant to the work. Over and over again, accompanied by his personal attendants, he would
dash out of the walls and drive in the enemy's outposts, first at one point and then at another
of the beleaguering circle. But the time eventually came when, search as they might by every
means, these picked defenders (13) could find no further store of food within the walls, and
they were forced to send to Agesilaus, requesting a truce for an embassy to visit Sparta, adding
that they were resolved to leave it to the discretion of the authorities at Lacedaemon to do
with their city what they liked. Agesilaus granted a pass to the embassy, but, at the same
time, he was so angry at their setting his personal authority aside, that he sent to his friends
at home and arranged that the fate of Phlius should be left to his discretion. Meanwhile he
proceeded to tighten the cordon of investment, so as to render it impossible that a single
soul inside the city should escape. In spite of this, however, Delphion, with one comrade,
a branded dare-devil, who had shown great dexterity in relieving the besieging parties of their
arms, escaped by night. Presently the deputation returned with the answer from Lacedaemon that
the state simply left it entirely to the discretion of Agesilaus to decide the fate of Phlius
as seemed to him best. Then Agesilaus announced his verdict. A board of one hundred--fifty
taken from the restored exiles, fifty from those within the city--were in the first place to
make inquisition as to who deserved to live and who to die, after which they were to lay down
laws as the basis of a new constitution. Pending the carrying out of these transactions, he
left a detachment of troops to garrison the place for six months, with pay for that period.
After this he dismissed the allied forces, and led the state (14) division home. Thus the transactions
concerning Phlius were brought to a conclusion, having occupied altogether one year and eight
months.

 (13) See below, "Hell." VII. i. 19.

 (14) {to politokon}, the citizen army. See above, IV. iv. 19; "Pol.
    Lac." xi.

Meanwhile Polybiades had reduced the citizens of Olynthus to the last stage of misery through
famine. Unable to supply themselves with corn from their own land, or to import it by sea,
they were forced to send an embassy to Lacedaemon to sue for peace. The plenipotentiaries on
their arrival accepted articles of agreement by which they bound themselves to have the same
friends and the same foes as Lacedaemon, to follow her lead, and to be enrolled among her allies;
and so, having taken an oath to abide by these terms, they returned home.

On every side the affairs of Lacedaemon had signally prospered: Thebes and the rest of the
Boeotian states lay absolutely at her feet; Corinth had become her most faithful ally; Argos,
unable longer to avail herself of the subterfuge of a movable calendar, was humbled to the
dust; Athens was isolated; and, lastly, those of her own allies who displayed a hostile feeling
towards her had been punished; so that, to all outward appearance, the foundations of her empire
were at length absolutely well and firmly laid.

IV

Abundant examples might be found, alike in Hellenic and in foreign history, to prove that the
Divine powers mark what is done amiss, winking neither at impiety nor at the commission of
unhallowed acts; but at present I confine myself to the facts before me. (1) The Lacedaemonians,
who had pledged themselves by oath to leave the states independent, had laid violent hands
on the acropolis of Thebes, and were eventually punished by the victims of that iniquity single-handed--the
Lacedaemonians, be it noted, who had never before been mastered by living man; and not they
alone, but those citizens of Thebes who introduced them to their acropolis, and who wished
to enslave their city to Lacedaemon, that they might play the tyrant themselves--how fared
it with them? A bare score of the fugitives were sufficient to destroy their government. How
this happened I will now narrate in detail.

 (1) Or, "it is of my own subject that I must now speak." For the
    "peripety," or sudden reversal of circumstances, on which the plot
    of the "Hellenica" hinges, see Grote, "H. G." x. 100-108. Cf.
    Soph. "Oed. Tyr." 450; "Antig." 1066; Thuc. v. 116; "Hellenica
    Essays," "Xenophon," p. 382 foll. This passage is perhaps the key
    to the historian's position.

There was a man named Phyllidas--he was secretary to Archias, that is, to the polemarchs. (2)
Beyond his official duties, he had rendered his chief other services, and all apparently in
an exemplary fashion. A visit to Athens in pursuance of some business brought this man into
contact with a former acquaintance of his, Melon, one of the exiles who had fled for safety
to Athens. Melon had various questions to ask touching the sort of tyranny practised by Archias
in the exercise of the polemarchy, and by Philip. He soon discovered that affairs at home were
still more detestable to Phyllidas than to himself. It only remained to exchange pledges, and
to arrange the details of what was to be done. After a certain interval Melon, accompanied
by six of the trustiest comrades he could find among his fellow-exiles, set off for Thebes.
They were armed with nothing but daggers, and first of all crept into the neighbourhood under
cover of night. The whole of the next day they lay concealed in a desert place, and drew near
to the city gates in the guise of labourers returning home with the latest comers from the
fields. Having got safely within the city, they spent the whole of that night at the house
of a man named Charon, and again the next day in the same fashion. Phyllidas meanwhile was
busily taken up with the concerns of the polemarchs, who were to celebrate a feast of Aphrodite
on going out of office. Amongst other things, the secretary was to take this opportunity of
fulfilling an old undertaking, which was the introduction of certain women to the polemarchs.
They were to be the most majestic and the most beautiful to be found in Thebes. The polemarchs,
on their side (and the character of the men is sufficiently marked), were looking forward to
the pleasures of the night with joyful anticipation. Supper was over, and thanks to the zeal
with which the master of the ceremonies responded to their mood, they were speedily intoxicated.
To their oft-repeated orders to introduce their mistresses, he went out and fetched Melon and
the rest, three of them dressed up as ladies and the rest as their attendant maidens. Having
brought them into the treasury of the polemarchs' residence, (3) he returned himself and announced
to Archias and his friends that the women would not present themselves as long as any of the
attendants remained in the room; whereupon they promptly bade all withdraw, and Phyllidas,
furnishing the servants with a stoup of wine, sent them off to the house of one of them. And
now at last he introduced the mistresses, and led them to their seats beside their respective
lords. It was preconcerted that as soon as they were seated they were to throw aside their
veils and strike home. That is one version of the death of the polemarchs. (4) According to
another, Melon and his friends came in as revellers, and so despatched their victims.

 (2) Lit. "to Archias and his (polemarchs)"; but the Greek phrase does
    not, as the English would, imply that there were actually more
    than two polemarchs, viz. Archias and Philippus. Hypates and
    Leontiades belonged to the faction, but were neither of them
    polemarchs.

 (3) Lit. "Polemarcheion."

 (4) Or, "and so, according to the prevalent version of the matter, the
    polemarchs were slain. But some say that..."

That over, Phyllidas, with three of the band, set off to the house of Leontiades. Arrived there,
he knocked on the door, and sent in word that he had a message from the polemarchs. Leontiades,
as chance befell, was still reclining in privacy after dinner, and his wife was seated beside
him working wools. The fidelity of Phyllidas was well known to him, and he gave orders to admit
him at once. They entered, slew Leontiades, and with threats silenced his wife. As they went
out they ordered the door to be shut, threatening that if they found it open they would kill
every one in the house. And now that this deed was done, Phyllidas, with two of the band, presented
himself at the prison, telling the gaoler he had brought a man from the polemarchs to be locked
up. The gaoler opened the door, and was at once despatched, and the prisoners were released.
These they speedily supplied with arms taken from the armoury in the stoa, and then led them
to the Ampheion, (5) and bade them take up a position there, after which they at once made
a proclamation calling on all Thebans to come out, horse and foot, seeing that the tyrants
were dead. The citizens, indeed, as long as it was night, not knowing whom or what to trust,
kept quiet, but when day dawned and revealed what had occurred, the summons was responded to
with alacrity, heavy infantry and cavalry under arms alike sallying forth. Horsemen were also
despatched by the now restored exiles to the two Athenian generals on the frontier; and they,
being aware of the object of the message (promptly responded). (6)

 (5) See plan of Thebes, "Dict. Geog."; Arrian, "Anab." i. 8; Aesch.
    "Sept. c. Theb." 528.

 (6) Supply {epeboethoun}. There is a lacuna in the MSS. at this point.

On the other hand, the Lacedaemonian governor in the citadel, as soon as that night's proclamation
reached his ears, was not slow to send to Plataeae (7) and Thespiae for reinforcements. The
approach of the Plataeans was perceived by the Theban cavalry, who met them and killed a score
of them and more, and after that achievement returned to the city, to find the Athenians from
the frontier already arrived. Then they assaulted the acropolis. The troops within recognised
the paucity of their own numbers, whilst the zeal of their opponents (one and all advancing
to the attack) was plainly visible, and loud were the proclamations, promising rewards to those
who should be first to scale the walls. All this so worked upon their fears that they agreed
to evacuate the place if the citizens would allow them a safe-conduct to retire with their
arms. To this request the others gladly yielded, and they made a truce. Oaths were taken on
the terms aforesaid, and the citizens dismissed their adversaries. For all that, as the garrison
retired, those of them who were recognised as personal foes were seized and put to death. Some
were rescued through the good offices of the Athenian reinforcements from the frontier, who
smuggled them across and saved them. The Thebans were not content with putting the men to death;
if any of them had children, these also were sacrificed to their vengeance.

 (7) This city had been refounded in B.C. 386 (Isocr. "Plat." 20, 21).
    See Freeman, op. cit. ch. iv. p. 170: "Its restoration implied not
    only a loss of Theban supremacy, but the actual loss of that
    portion of the existing Theban territory which had formerly formed
    the Plataian district."

B.C. 378. When the news of these proceedings reached Sparta the first thing the Lacedaemonians
did was to put to death the governor, who had abandoned the Cadmeia instead of awaiting reinforcements,
and the next was to call out the ban against Thebes. Agesilaus had little taste to head the
expedition; he pointed out that he had seen more than forty years' service, (8) and that the
exemption from foreign duty applicable to others at that age was applicable on the same principle
to the king. Such were the ostensible grounds on which he excused himself from the present
expedition, but his real objections lay deeper. He felt certain that if he led the expedition
his fellow-citizens would say: "Agesilaus caused all this trouble to the state in order to
aid and abet tyrants." Therefore he preferred to leave his countrymen to settle the matter
themselves as they liked. Accordingly the ephors, instructed by the Theban exiles who had escaped
the late massacres, despatched Cleombrotus. He had not commanded before, and it was the depth
of winter.

 (8) And was therefore more than fifty-eight years old at this date.
    See "Ages." i. 6.

Now while Chabrias, with a body of Athenian peltasts, kept watch and ward over the road through
Eleutherae, Cleombrotus made his way up by the direct route to Plataeae. His column of light
infantry, pushing forward in advance, fell upon the men who had been released from the Theban
prison, guarding the summit, to the number of about one hundred and fifty. These, with the
exception of one or two who escaped, were cut down by the peltasts, and Cleombrotus descended
in person upon Plataeae, which was still friendly to Sparta. Presently he reached Thespiae,
and that was the base for an advance upon Cynoscephalae, where he encamped on Theban territory.
Here he halted sixteen days, and then again fell back upon Thespiae. At this latter place he
now left Sphodrias as governor, with a third portion of each of the contingents of the allies,
handing over to him all the moneys he had brought with him from home, with directions to supplement
his force with a contingent of mercenaries.

While Sphodrias was so employed, Cleombrotus himself commenced his homeward march, following
the road through Creusis at the head of his own moiety of the troops, who indeed were in considerable
perplexity to discover whether they were at war with the Thebans or at peace, seeing that the
general had led his army into Theban territory, had inflicted the minimum of mischief, and
again retired. No sooner, however, was his back turned than a violent wind storm assailed him
in his rear, which some construed as an omen clearly significant of what was about to take
place. Many a blow this assailant dealt them, and as the general and his army, crossing from
Creusis, scaled that face of the mountain (9) which stretches seaward, the blast hurled headlong
from the precipices a string of asses, baggage and all: countless arms were wrested from the
bearers' grasp and whirled into the sea; finally, numbers of the men, unable to march with
their arms, deposited them at different points of the pass, first filling the hollow of their
shields with stones. For the moment, then, they halted at Aegosthena, on Megarian soil, and
supped as best they could. Next day they returned and recovered their arms. After this adventure
the contingents lost no time in returning to their several homes, as Cleombrotus disbanded them.

 (9) I.e. "Cithaeron."

Meanwhile at Athens and Thebes alike fear reigned. To the Athenians the strength of the Lacedaemonians
was unmistakable: the war was plainly no longer confined to Corinth; on the contrary, the Lacedaemonians
had ventured to skirt Athenian territory and to invade Thebes. They were so worked upon by
their alarm that the two generals who had been privy to the insurrection of Melon against Leontiades
and his party had to suffer: the one was formally tried and put to death; the other, refusing
to abide his trial, was banished.

The apprehensions of the Thebans were of a different sort: their fear was rather lest they
should find themselves in single-handed war with Lacedaemon. To prevent this they hit upon
the following expedient. They worked upon Sphodrias, (10) the Spartan governor left in Thespiae,
by offering him, as at least was suspected, a substantial sum, in return for which he was to
make an incursion into Attica; their great object being to involve Athens and Lacedaemon in
hostilities. Sphodrias lent a willing ear, and, pretending that he could easily capture Piraeus
in its present gateless condition, gave his troops an early evening meal and marched out of
Thespiae, saying that he would reach Piraeus before daybreak. As a matter of fact day overtook
him at Thria, nor did he take any pains even to draw a veil over his intentions; on the contrary,
being forced to turn aside, he amused himself by recklessly lifting cattle and sacking houses.
Meanwhile some who chanced upon him in the night had fled to the city and brought news to the
men of Athens that a large body of troops was approaching. It needs no saying with what speed
the cavalry and heavy infantry armed themselves and stood on guard to protect the city. As
chance befell, there were some Lacedaemonian ambassadors in Athens at the moment, at the house
of Callias their proxenos; their names were Etymocles, Aristolochus, and Ocyllus. Immediately
on receipt of the news the Athenians seized these three and imprisoned them, as not improbably
concerned in the plot. Utterly taken aback by the affair themselves, the ambassadors pleaded
that, had they been aware of an attempt to seize Piraeus, they would hardly have been so foolish
as to put themselves into the power of the Athenians, or have selected the house of their proxenos
for protection, where they were so easily to be found. It would, they further urged, soon be
plain to the Athenians themselves that the state of Lacedaemon was quite as little cognisant
of these proceedings as they. "You will hear before long"--such was their confident prediction--"that
Sphodrias has paid for his behaviour by his life." On this wise the ambassadors were acquitted
of all concern in the matter and dismissed. Sphodrias himself was recalled and indicted by
the ephors on the capital charge, and, in spite of his refusal to face the trial, he was acquitted.
This miscarriage of justice, as it seemed to many, who described it as unprecedented in Lacedaemon,
has an explanation.

 (10) See Plut. "Pel." xiv. (Clough, ii. p. 214).

Sphodrias had a son named Cleonymus. He was just at the age when youth emerges from boyhood,
very handsome and of high repute among his fellows. To this youth Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus,
was passionately attached. Now the friends of Cleombrotus, as comrades of Sphodrias, were disposed
to acquit him; but they feared Agesilaus and his friends, not to mention the intermediate party,
for the enormity of his proceeding was clear. So when Sphodrias addressed his son Cleonymus:
"You have it in your power, my son, to save your father, if you will, by begging Archidamus
to dispose Agesilaus favourably to me at my trial." Thus instructed, the youth did not shrink
from visiting Archidamus, and implored him for his sake to save his father. Now when Archidamus
saw how Cleonymus wept, he too was melted to tears as he stood beside him, but to his petition
he made answer thus: "Nay, Cleonymus, it is the bare truth I tell you, I cannot so much as
look my father in the face; (11) if I wished anything transacted for me in the city I would
beg assistance from the whole world sooner than from my father. Still, since it is you who
bid me, rest assured I will do my best to bring this about for you as you desire." He then
left the common hall (12) and retired home to rest, but with dawn he arose and kept watch that
his father might not go out without his knowledge. Presently, when he saw him ready to go forth,
first some citizen was present, and then another and another; and in each case he stepped aside,
while they held his father in conversation. By and by a stranger would come, and then another;
and so it went on until he even found himself making way for a string of petitioning attendants.
At last, when his father had turned his back on the Eurotas, and was entering his house again,
he was fain to turn his back also and be gone without so much as accosting him. The next day
he fared no better: all happened as on the previous day. Now Agesilaus, although he had his
suspicions why his son went to and fro in this way, asked no questions, but left him to take
his own course. Archidamus, on his side, was longing, as was natural, to see his friend Cleonymus;
but how he was to visit him, without having held the desired conversation with his father,
he knew not. The friends of Sphodrias, observing that he who was once so frequent a visitor
had ceased coming, were in agony; he must surely have been deterred by the reproaches of his
father. At last, however, Archidamus dared to go to his father, and said, "Father, Cleonymus
bids me ask you to save his father; grant me this boon, if possible, I beg you." He answered:
"For yourself, my son, I can make excuse, but how shall my city make excuse for me if I fail
to condemn that man who, for his own base purpose, traffics to the injury of the state?" For
the moment the other made no reply, but retired crestfallen before the verdict of justice.
Afterwards, whether the thought was his own or that he was prompted by some other, he came
and said, "Father, if Sphodrias had done no wrong you would have released him, that I know;
but now, if he has done something wrong, may he not be excused by you for our sakes?" And the
father answered: "If it can be done without loss of honour on our parts, so shall it be." At
that word the young man, in deep despondency, turned and went. Now one of the friends of Sphodrias,
conversing with Etymocles, remarked to him: "You are all bent on putting Sphodrias to death,
I take it, you friends of Agesilaus?" And Etymocles replied: "If that be so, we all are bent
on one thing, and Agesilaus on another, since in all his conversations he still harps upon
one string: that Sphodrias has done a wrong there is no denying, yet Sphodrias is a man who,
from boyhood to ripe manhood, (13) was ever constant to the call of honour. To put such a man
as that to death is hard; nay, Sparta needs such soldiers." The other accordingly went off
and reported what he had just heard to Cleonymus; and he in the joy of his heart went straightway
to Archidamus and said: "Now we know that you care for us; rest assured, Archidamus, that we
in turn will take great pains that you shall never have cause to blush for our friendship."
Nor did his acts belie his words; but so long as he lived he was ever faithful to the code
of Spartan chivalry; and at Leuctra, fighting in front of the king side by side with Deinon
the polemarch, thrice fell or ever he yielded up his breath--foremost of the citizens amidst
the foe. And so, albeit he caused his friend the bitterest sorrow, yet to that which he had
promised he was faithful, seeing he wrought Archidamus no shame, but contrariwise shed lustre
on him. (14) In this way Sphodrias obtained his acquittal.

At Athens the friends of Boeotia were not slow to instruct the people that his countrymen,
so far from punishing Sphodrias, had even applauded him for his designs on Athens; and in consequence
of this the Athenians not only furnished Piraeus with gates, but set to work to build a fleet,
and displayed great zeal in sending aid to the Boeotians. (15) The Lacedaemonians, on their
side, called out the ban against the Thebans; and being persuaded that in Agesilaus they would
find a more prudent general than Cleombrotus had proved, they begged the former to undertake
the expedition. (16) He, replying that the wish of the state was for him law, began making
preparations to take the field.

Now he had come to the conclusion that without the occupation of Mount Cithaeron any attack
on Thebes would be difficult. Learning then that the men of Cleitor were just now at war with
the men of Orchomenus, (17) and were maintaining a foreign brigade, he came to an understanding
with the Cleitorians that in the event of his needing it, this force would be at his service;
and as soon as the sacrifices for crossing the frontier proved favourable, he sent to the commander
of the Cleitorian mercenaries, and handing him a month's pay, ordered him to occupy Cithaeron
with his men. This was before he himself reached Tegea. Meanwhile he sent a message to the
men of Orchomenus that so long as the campaign lasted they must cease from war. If any city
during his campaign abroad took on itself to march against another city, his first duty, he
declared, would be to march against such offending city in accordance with a decree of the allies.

 (17) In Arcadia. See Busolt, "Die Lak." 120 foll.

Thus crossing Cithaeron he reached Thespiae, (18) and from that base made the territory of
Thebes his objective. Finding the great plain fenced round with ditch and palisade, as also
the most valuable portions of the country, he adopted the plan of shifting his encampment from
one place to another. Regularly each day, after the morning meal, he marched out his troops
and ravaged the territory, confining himself to his own side of the palisadings and trench.
The appearance of Agesilaus at any point whatever was a signal to the enemy, who within the
circuit of his entrenchment kept moving in parallel line to the invader, and was ever ready
to defend the threatened point. On one occasion, the Spartan king having retired and being
well on the road back to camp, the Theban cavalry, hitherto invisible, suddenly dashed out,
following one of the regularly constructed roads out of the entrenchment. Taking advantage
of the enemy's position--his light troops breaking off to supper or busily preparing the meal,
and the cavalry, some of them on their legs just (19) dismounted, and others in the act of
mounting--on they rode, pressing the charge home. Man after man of the light troops was cut
down; and three cavalry troopers besides--two Spartans, Cleas and Epicydidas by name, and the
third a provincial (20) named Eudicus, who had not had time to mount their horses, and whose
fate was shared by some Theban (21) exiles. But presently Agesilaus wheeled about and advanced
with his heavy infantry to the succour; his cavalry dashed at the enemy's cavalry, and the
flower of the heavy infantry, the ten-years-service men, charged by their side. The Theban
cavalry at that instant looked like men who had been imbibing too freely in the noontide heat--that
is to say, they awaited the charge long enough to hurl their spears; but the volley sped without
effect, and wheeling about within that distance they left twelve of their number dead upon
the field.

Agesilaus had not failed to note with what regularity the enemy presented himself after the
morning meal. Turning the observation to account, he offered sacrifice with day's dawn, and
marched with all possible speed, and so crossed within the palisadings, through what might
have been a desert, as far as defence or sign of living being went. Once well inside, he proceeded
to cut down and set on fire everything up to the city gates. After this exploit he beat a retreat,
retiring into Thespiae, where he fortified their citadel for them. Here he left Phoebidas as
governor, while he himself crossed the passes back into Megara. Arrived here he disbanded the
allies, and led the city troops homewards.

After the departure of Agesilaus, Phoebidas devoted himself to harrying the Thebans by sending
out robber bands, and laid waste their land by a system of regular incursions. The Thebans,
on their side, desiring to retaliate, marched out with their whole force into the territory
of Thespiae. But once well inside the district they found themselves closely beset by Phoebidas
and his light troops, who would not give them the slightest chance to scatter from their main
body, so that the Thebans, heartily vexed at the turn their foray had taken, beat a retreat
quicker than they had come. The muleteers threw away with their own hands the fruits they had
captured, in their anxiety to get home as quickly as possible; so dire a dread had fallen upon
the invading army. This was the chance for the Spartan to press home his attack boldly, keeping
his light division in close attendance on himself, and leaving the heavy infantry under orders
to follow him in battle order. He was in hopes even that he might put the enemy to complete
rout, so valiantly did he lead the advance, encouraging the light troops to "come to a close
grip with the invadors," or summoning the heavy infantry of the Thespiaeans to "bring up their
supports." Presently the Theban cavalry as they retired found themselves face to face with
an impassable glen or ravine, where in the first instance they collected in a mob, and next
wheeled right-about-face in sheer resourcelessness where to cross. The handful of light troops
who formed the Spartan vanguard took fright at the Thebans and fled, and the Theban horsemen
seeing this put in practice the lesson of attack which the fugitives taught them. As for Phoebidas
himself, he and two or three with him fell sword in hand, whereupon his mercenary troops all
took to their heels.

When the stream of fugitives reached the Thespiaean heavy infantry reserves, they too, in spite
of much boasting beforehand that they would never yield to Thebans, took to flight, though
there was now absolutely no pursuit whatever, for it was now late. The number slain was not
large, but, for all that, the men of Thespiae did not come to a standstill until they found
themselves safe inside their walls. As a sequel, the hopes and spirits of the Thebans were
again kindled into new life, and they made campaigns against Thespiae and the other provincial
cities of Boeotia. (22) It must be admitted that in each case the democratical party retired
from these cities to Thebes; since absolute governments had been established in all of them
on the pattern previously adopted at Thebes; and the result was that the friends of Lacedaemon
in these cities also needed her assistance. (23) After the death of Phoebidas the Lacedaemonians
despatched a polemarch with a division by sea to form the garrison of Thespiae.

B.C. 377. With the advent of spring (24) the ephors again called out the ban against Thebes,
and requested Agesilaus to lead the expedition, as on the former campaign. He, holding to his
former theory with regard to the invasion, even before sacrificing the customary frontier sacrifice,
sent a despatch to the polemarch at Thespiae, with orders to seize the pass which commands
the road over Cithaeron, and to guard it against his arrival. Then, having once more crossed
the pass and reached Plataeae, he again made a feint of marching first into Thespiae, and so
sent a despatch ordering supplies to be in readiness, and all embassies to be waiting his arrival
there; so that the Thebans concentrated their attention on the approaches from Thespiae, which
they strongly guarded. Next morning, however, Agesilaus sacrificed at daybreak and set out
on the road to Erythrae, (25) and completing in one day what was a good two days' march for
an army, gave the Thebans the slip, and crossed their palisade-work at Scolus before the enemy
had arrived from the closely-guarded point at which he had effected his entrance formerly.
This done he proceeded to ravage the eastward-facing districts of the city of Thebes as far
as the territory of Tanagra, for at that date Tanagra was still in the hands of Hypatodorus
and his party, who were friends of the Lacedaemonians. After that he turned to retire, keeping
the walls of Thebes on his left. But the Thebans, who had stolen, as it were, upon the scene,
drew up at the spot called "The Old Wife's Breast," (26) keeping the trench and palisading
in their rear: they were persuaded that here, if anywhere, lay their chance to risk a decisive
engagement, the ground at this point being somewhat narrow and difficult to traverse. Agesilaus,
however, in view of the situation, refused to accept the challenge. Instead of marching upon
them he turned sharp off in the direction of the city; and the Thebans, in alarm for the city
in its undefended state, abandoned the favourable ground on which they were drawn up in battle
line, and retired at the double towards the city along the road to Potniae, which seemed the
safer route. This last move of Agesilaus may be described as a stroke of genius: (27) while
it allowed him to retire to a distance, it forced the enemy themselves to retreat at the double.
In spite of this, however, one or two of the polemarchs, with their divisions, charged the
foe as he raced past. But again the Thebans, from the vantage-ground of their heights, sent
volleys of spears upon the assailants, which cost one of the polemarchs, Alypetus, his life.
He fell pierced by a spear. But again from this particular crest the Thebans on their side
were forced to turn in flight; so much so that the Sciritae, with some of the cavalry, scaled
up and speedily cut down the rearmost ranks of the Thebans as they galloped past into the city.
When, however, they were close under cover of their walls the Thebans turned, and the Sciritae
seeing them retreated at more than a steady walking pace. No one, it is true, was slain; but
the Thebans all the same set up a trophy in record of the incident at the point where the scaling
party had been forced to retreat.

 (27) Or, "and this move of Agesilaus was regarded as a very pretty
    one."

And now, since the hour was come, Agesilaus fell back and encamped on the very site on which
he had seen the enemy drawn up in battle array. Next day he retired by the road to Thespiae.
The light troops, who formed a free corps in the pay of the Thebans, hung audaciously at his
heels. Their shouts could be heard calling out to Chabrias (28) for not bringing up his supports;
when the cavalry of the Olynthians (who now contributed a contingent in accordance with their
oaths) (29) wheeled round on them, caught the pursuers in the heat of their pursuit, and drove
them uphill, putting large numbers of them to the sword--so quickly are infantry overhauled
by cavalry on steep ground which can be ridden over. Being arrived within the walls of Thespiae,
Agesilaus found the citizens in a state of party feud, the men of Lacedaemonian proclivities
desiring to put their political opponents, one of whom was Menon, to death (30)--a proceeding
which Agesilaus would not sanction. After having healed their differences and bound them over
by solemn oath to keep the peace with one another, he at once retired, taking his old route
across Cithaeron to Megara. Here once more he disbanded the allies, and at the head of the
city troops himself marched back to Sparta.

    Athenians and mercenaries (see above, S. 14), see Dem. "c. Lept."

The Thebans had not gathered in the fruits of their soil for two years now, and began to be
sorely pinched for want of corn; they therefore sent a body of men on board a couple of triremes
to Pagasae, with ten talents (31) in hand for the purchase of corn. But while these commissioners
were engaged in effecting their purchases, Alcetas, the Lacedaemonian who was garrisoning Oreus,
(32) fitted out three triremes, taking precautions that no rumour of his proceedings should
leak out. As soon as the corn was shipped and the vessels under weigh, he captured not only
the corn but the triremes, escort and all, numbering no less than three hundred men. This done
he locked up his prisoners in the citadel, where he himself was also quartered. Now there was
a youth, the son of a native of Oreus, fair of mien and of gentle breeding, (33) who danced
attendance on the commandant: and the latter must needs leave the citadel and go down to busy
himself with this youth. This was a piece of carelessness which the prisoners did not fail
to observe, and turned to good account by seizing the citadel, whereupon the town revolted,
and the Thebans experienced no further difficulty in obtaining corn supplies.

B.C. 376. At the return of spring Agesilaus lay sick--a bedridden invalid. The history of the
case is this: During the withdrawal of his army from Thebes the year before, when at Megara,
while mounting from the Aphrodision (34) to the Government house he ruptured a vein or other
vessel of the body. This was followed by a rush of blood to his sound leg. The knee was much
swelled, and the pain intolerable, until a Syracusan surgeon made an incision in the vein near
the ankle. The blood thus let flowed night and day; do what they could to stop the discharge,
all failed, till the patient fainted away; then it ceased. In this plight Agesilaus was conveyed
home on a litter to Lacedaemon, and remained an invalid the rest of that summer and throughout
the winter.

 (34) Pausanius (I. xi. 6) mentions a temple of Aphrodite
    {'Epistrophoa} (Verticordia), on the way up to the Carian
    Acropolis of Megara.

But to resume: at the first burst of spring the Lacedaemonians again called out the ban, and
gave orders to Cleombrotus to lead the expedition. The king found himself presently with his
troops at the foot of Cithaeron, and his light infantry advanced to occupy the pass which commands
the road. But here they found a detachment of Thebans and Athenians already in occupation of
the desired height, who for a while suffered them to approach; but when they were close upon
them, sprang from their position and charged, putting about forty to the sword. This incident
was sufficient to convince Cleombrotus that to invade Thebes by this mountain passage was out
of the question, and in this faith he led back and disbanded his troops.

The allies met in Lacedaemon, and arguments were adduced on the part of the allies to show
that faintheartedness would very soon lead to their being absolutely worn out by the war. They
had got it in their power, it was urged, to fit out a fleet far outnumbering that of Athens,
and to reduce that city by starvation; it was open to them, in the self-same ships, to carry
an army across into Theban territory, and they had a choice of routes--the road into Phocis,
or, if they preferred, by Creusis. After thus carefully considering the matter they manned
a fleet of sixty triremes, and Pollis was appointed admiral in command. Nor indeed were their
expectations altogether belied. The Athenians were soon so closely blockaded that their corn
vessels could get no farther than Geraestus; (35) there was no inducing them to coast down
father south, with a Lacedaemonian navy hovering about Aegina and Ceos and Andros. The Athenians,
making a virtue of necessity, manned their ships in person, gave battle to Pollis under the
leadership of Chabrias, and came out of the sea-fight (36) victorious.

B.C. 375. Then the corn supplies flowed freely into Athens. The Lacedaemonians, on their side,
were preparing to transport an army across the water into Boeotia, when the Thebans sent a
request to the Athenians urging them to despatch an armament round Peloponnesus, under the
persuasion that if this were done the Lacedaemonians would find it impossible at once to guard
their own or the allied territory in that part of the world, and at the same time to convery
an army of any size to operate against Thebes. The proposals fell in with the present temper
of the Athenians, irritated with Lacedaemon on account of the exploit of Sphodrias. Accordingly
they eagerly manned a fleet of sixty vessels, appointing Timotheus as admiral in command, and
despatched it on a cruise round Peloponnesus.

The Thebans, seeing that there had been no hostile invasion of their territory for so long
(neither during the campaign of Cleombrotus nor now, (37) whilst Timotheus prosecuted his coasting
voyage), felt emboldened to carry out a campaign on their own account against the provincial
cities; (38) and one by one they again recovered them.

 (37) Lit. "nor at the date of Timotherus's periplus." To the historian
    writing of the events of this period several years later, the
    coasting voyage of Timotheus is a single incident ({periepleuse}),
    and as Grote ("H. G." x. 185, note 3) observes, the words may
    "include not simply the time which Timotheus took in actually
    circumnavigating Peloponnesos, but the year which he spent
    afterwards in the Ionian sea, and the time which he occupied in
    performing his exploits near Korkyra, Leukas, and the
    neighbourhood generally." For the character and exploits of
    Timotheus, son of Conon, see Isocr. "Or." xv. "On the Antidosis,"
    SS. 101-139; Jebb, "Att. Or." ii. p. 140 foll.; Rehdantz, "Vit.

    "Pelop." 17; Diod. xv. 57 ("evidently this battle," Grote);

Timotheus in his cruise reached Corcyra, and reduced it at a blow. That done, he neither enslaved
the inhabitants nor drove them into exile, nor changed their laws. And of this conduct he reaped
the benefit of the increased cordiality (39) of all the cities of those parts. The Lacedaemonians
thereupon fitted out and despatched a counter fleet, with Nicolochus in command, an officer
of consummate boldness. This admiral no sooner caught sight of Timotheus's fleet than without
hesitation, and in spite of the absence of six Ambraciot vessels which formed part of his squadron,
he gave battle, with fifty-five ships to the enemy's sixty. The result was a defeat at the
moment, and Timotheus set up a trophy at Alyzia. But as soon as the six missing Ambraciot vessels
had reinforced him--the ships of Timotheus meanwhile being docked and undergoing repairs--he
bore down upon Alyzia in search of the Athenian, and as Timotheus refused to put out to meet
him, the Lacedaemonian in turn set up a trophy on the nearest group of islands.

 (39) The Corcyraeans, Acarnanians, and Cephallenians join the alliance
    B.C. 375; see Hicks, 83. "This decree dates from the autumn of
    B.C. 375, immediately after Timotheos's visit to Korkyra (Xen.
    'Hell.' V. iv. 64). The result was that the names of Korkyra,
    Kephallenia, and Akarnania were inscribed upon the list (No. 81),
    and an alliance was made with them." (See "C. I. A." ii. p. 399

B.C. 374. Timotheus, after repairing his original squadron and manning more vessels from Corcyra,
found himself at the head of more than seventy ships. His naval superiority was undisputed,
but he was forced to send to Athens for moneys, seeing his fleet was large and his wants not
trifling.

B.C. 374. The Athenians and Lacedaemonians were thus engaged. But to return to the Thebans.
After the subjugation of the cities in Boeotia, they extended the area of aggression and marched
into Phocis. The Phocians, on their side, sent an embassy to Lacedaemon, and pleaded that without
assistance from that power they must inevitably yield to Thebes. The Lacedaemonians in response
conveyed by sea into the territory of Phocis their king Cleombrotus, at the head of four regiments
and the contingents of the allies.

About the same time Polydamus of Pharsalus arrived from Thessaly to address the general assembly
(1) of Lacedaemon. He was a man of high repute throughout the whole of Thessaly, while in his
native city he was regarded as so true a gentleman that the faction-ridden Pharsalians were
content to entrust the citadel to his keeping, and to allow their revenues to pass through
his hands. It was his privilege to disburse the money needed for sacred rites or other expenditure,
within the limits of their written law and constitution. Out of these moneys this faithful
steward of the state was able to garrison and guard in safety for the citizens their capital.
Every year he rendered an account of his administration in general. If there was a deficit
he made it up out of his own pocket, and when the revenues expanded he paid himself back. For
the rest, his hospitality to foreigners and his magnificence were on a true Thessalian scale.
Such was the style and character of the man who now arrived in Lacedaemon and spoke as follows:

 (1) {pros to koinon}, "h.e. vel ad ad senatum vel ad ephoros vel ad
    concionem."--Sturz, "Lex. Xen." s.v.

"Men of Lacedaemon, it is in my capacity as 'proxenos' and 'benefactor' (titles borne by my
ancestry from time immemorial) that I claim, or rather am bound, in case of any difficulty
to come to you, and, in case of any complication dangerous to your interests in Thessaly, to
give you warning. The name of Jason, I feel sure, is not unknown to Lacedaemonian ears. His
power as a prince is sufficiently large, and his fame widespread. It is of Jason I have to
speak. Under cover of a treaty of peace he has lately conferred with me, and this is the substance
of what he urged: 'Polydamas,' he said, 'if I chose I could lay your city at my feet, even
against its will, as the following considerations will prove to you. See,' he went on, 'the
majority and the most important of the states of Thessaly are my allies. I subdued them in
campaigns in which you took their side in opposition to myself. Again, you do not need to be
told that I have six thousand mercenaries who are a match in themselves, I take it, for any
single state. It is not the mere numbers on which I insist. No doubt as large an army could
be raised in other quarters; but these citizen armies have this defect--they include men who
are already advanced in years, with others whose beards are scarcely grown. Again, it is only
a fraction of the citizens who attend to bodily training in a state, whereas with me no one
takes mercenary service who is not as capable of endurance as myself.'

"And here, Lacedaemonians, I must tell you what is the bare truth. This Jason is a man stout
of limb and robust of body, with an insatiable appetite for toil. Equally true is it that he
tests the mettle of those with him day by day. He is always at their head, whether on a field-day
under arms, or in the gymnasium, or on some military expedition. The weak members of the corps
he weeds out, but those whom he sees bear themselves stout-heartedly in the face of war, like
true lovers of danger and of toil, he honours with double, treble, and quadruple pay, or with
other gifts. On the bed of sickness they will not lack attendance, nor honour in their graves.
Thus every foreigner in his service knows that his valour in war may obtain for him a livelihood--a
life replete at once with honour and abundance. (2)

 (2) Or, "a life satisfying at once to soul and body."

"Then with some parade he pointed out to me what I knew before, that the Maracians, and the
Dolopians, and Alcetas the hyparch (3) in Epirus, were already subject to his sway; 'so that
I may fairly ask you, Polydamas,' he proceeded, 'what I have to apprehend that I should not
look on your future subjugation as mere child's play. Perhaps some one who did not know me,
and what manner of man I am, might put it to me: "Well! Jason, if all you say be true, why
do you hesitate? why do you not march at once against Pharsalia?" For the good reason, I reply,
that it suits me better to win you voluntarily than to annex you against your wills. Since,
if you are forced, you will always be planning all the mischief you can against me, and I on
my side shall be striving to diminish your power; whereas if you throw in your lot with mine
trustfully and willingly, it is certain we shall do what we can to help each other. I see and
know, Polydamas, that your country fixes her eyes on one man only, and that is yourself: what
I guarantee you, therefore, is that, if you will dispose her lovingly to myself, I on my side
will raise you up to be the greatest man in Hellas next to me. Listen, while I tell you what
it is in which I offer you the second prize. Listen, and accept nothing which does not approve
itself as true to your own reasoning. First, is it not plain to us both, that with the adhesion
of Pharsalus and the swarm of pettier states dependent on yourselves, I shall with infinite
ease become Tagos (4) of all the Thessalians; and then the corollary--Thessaly so united--sixteen
thousand cavalry and more than ten thousand heavy infantry leap into life. Indeed, when I contemplate
the physique and proud carriage of these men, I cannot but persuade myself that, with proper
handling, there is not a nation or tribe of men to which Thessalians would deign to yield submission.
Look at the broad expanse of Thessaly and consider: when once a Tagos is established here,
all the tribes in a circle round will lie stilled in subjection; and almost every member of
each of these tribes is an archer born, so that in the light infantry division of the service
our power must needs excel. Furthermore, the Boeotians and all the rest of the world in arms
against Lacedaemon are my allies; they clamour to follow my banner, if only I will free them
from Sparta's yoke. So again the Athenians, I make sure, will do all they can to gain our alliance;
but with them I do not think we will make friends, for my persuasion is that empire by sea
will be even easier to acquire than empire by land; and to show you the justice of this reasoning
I would have you weigh the following considerations. With Macedonia, which is the timber-yard
(5) of the Athenian navy, in our hands we shall be able to construct a far larger fleet than
theirs. That stands to reason. And as to men, which will be the better able to man vessels,
think you--Athens, or ourselves with our stalwart and numerous Penestae? (6) Which will better
support mariners--a nation which, like our own, out of her abundance exports her corn to foreign
parts, or Athens, which, but for foreign purchases, has not enough to support herself? And
so as to wealth in general it is only natural, is it not, that we, who do not look to a string
of little islands for supplies, but gather the fruits of continental peoples, should find our
resources more copious? As soon as the scattered powers of Thessaly are gathered into a principality,
all the tribes around, I repeat, will become our tributaries. I need not tell you that the
king of Persia reaps the fruits, not of islands, but of a continent, and he is the wealthiest
of men! But the reduction of Persia will be still more practicable, I imagine, than that of
Hellas, for there the men, save one, are better versed in slavery than in prowess. Nor have
I forgotten, during the advance of Cyrus, and afterwards under Agesilaus, how scant the force
was before which the Persian quailed.'

 (3) Or, "his underlord in Epirus." By hyparch, I suppose, is implied
    that Alcetas regarded Jason as his suzerain. Diodorus (xv. 13, 36)
    speaks of him as "king" of the Molossians.

 (4) Or, "Prince," and below, "Thessaly so converted into a
    Principality." "The Tagos of Thessaly was not a King, because his
    office was not hereditary or even permanent; neither was he
    exactly a Tyrant, because his office had some sort of legal
    sanction. But he came much nearer to the character either of a
    King or of a Tyrant than to that of a Federal President like the
    General of the Achaians.... Jason of Pherai acts throughout
    like a King, and his will seems at least as uncontrolled as that
    of his brother sovereign beyond the Kambunian hills. Even Jason
    seems to have been looked upon as a Tyrant (see below, 'Hell.' VI.
    iv. 32); possibly, like the Athenian Demos, he himself did not
    refuse the name" (cf. Arist. "Pol." iii. 4, 9).--Freeman, "Hist.
    Fed. Gov." "No True Federation in Thessaly," iv. pp. 152 foll.

 (5) See above, and Hicks, 74.

 (6) Or, "peasantry."

"Such, Lacedaemonians, were the glowing arguments of Jason. In answer I told him that what
he urged was well worth weighing, but that we, the friends of Lacedaemon, should so, without
a quarrel, desert her and rush into the arms of her opponents, seemed to me sheer madness.
Whereat he praised me, and said that now must he needs cling all the closer to me if that were
my disposition, and so charged me to come to you and tell you the plain truth, which is, that
he is minded to march against Pharsalus if we will not hearken to him. Accordingly he bade
me demand assistance from you; 'and if they suffer you,' (7) he added, 'so to work upon them
that they will send you a force sufficient to do battle with me, it is well: we will abide
by war's arbitrament, nor quarrel with the consequence; but if in your eyes that aid is insufficient,
look to yourself. How shall you longer be held blameless before that fatherland which honours
you and in which you fare so well?' (8)

 (7) Or, reading {theoi}, after Cobet; translate "if providentially
    they should send you."

 (8) Reading {kai e su pratteis}, after Cobet. The chief MSS. give {ouk
    ede anegkletos an dikaios eies en te patridi e se tima kai su
    prattois ta kratista}, which might be rendered either, "and how be
    doing best for yourself?"  (lit. "and you would not be doing best
    for yourself," {ouk an} carried on from previous clause), or
    (taking {prattois} as pure optative), "may you be guided to adopt
    the course best for yourself!" "may the best fortune attend you!
    Farewell." See Otto Keller, op. cit. ad loc. for various
    emendations.

"These are the matters," Polydamas continued, "which have brought me to Lacedaemon. I have
told you the whole story; it is based partly on what I see to be the case, and partly on what
I have heard from yonder man. My firm belief is, men of Lacedaemon, that if you are likely
to despatch a force sufficient, not in my eyes only, but in the eyes of all the rest of Thessaly,
to cope with Jason in war, the states will revolt from him, for they are all in alarm as to
the future development of the man's power; but if you think a company of newly-enfranchised
slaves and any amateur general will suffice, I advise you to rest in peace. You may take my
word for it, you will have a great power to contend against, and a man who is so prudent a
general that, in all he essays to do, be it an affair of secrecy, or speed, or force, he is
wont to hit the mark of his endeavours: one who is skilled, should occasion serve, to make
the night of equal service to him with the day; (9) or, if speed be needful, will labour on
while breakfasting or taking an evening meal. And as for repose, he thinks that the time for
it has come when the goal is reached or the business on hand accomplished. And to this same
practice he has habituated those about him. Right well he knows how to reward the expectations
of his soldiers, when by the extra toil which makes the difference they have achieved success;
so that in his school all have laid to heart that maxim, 'Pain first and pleasure after.' (10)
And in regard to pleasure of the senses, of all men I know, he is the most continent; so that
these also are powerless to make him idle at the expense of duty. You must consider the matter
then and tell me, as befits you, what you can and will do."

 (9) See "Cyrop." III. i. 19.

 (10) For this sentiment, see "Mem." II. i. 20 et passim.

Such were the representations of Polydamas. The Lacedaemonians, for the time being, deferred
their answer; but after calculating the next day and the day following how many divisions (11)
they had on foreign service, and how many ships on the coast of Laconia to deal with the foreign
squadron of the Athenians, and taking also into account the war with their neighbours, they
gave their answer to Polydamas: "For the present they would not be able to send him sufficient
aid: under the circumstances they advised him to go back and make the best settlement he could
of his own affairs and those of his city." He, thanking the Lacedaemonians for their straightforwardness,
withdrew.

 (11) Lit. "morai."

The citadel of Pharsalus he begged Jason not to force him to give up: his desire was to preserve
it for those who had entrusted it to his safe keeping; his own sons Jason was free to take
as hostages, and he would do his best to procure for him the voluntary adhesion of his city
by persuasion, and in every way to further his appointment as Tagos of Thessaly. Accordingly,
after interchange of solemn assurances between the pair, the Pharsalians were let alone and
in peace, and ere long Jason was, by general consent, appointed Tagos of all the Thessalians.
Once fairly vested with that authority, he drew up a list of the cavalry and heavy infantry
which the several states were capable of furnishing as their quota, with the result that his
cavalry, inclusive of allies, numbered more than eight thousand, while his infantry force was
computed at not less than twenty thousand; and his light troops would have been a match for
those of the whole world--the mere enumeration of their cities would be a labour in itself.
(12) His next act was a summons to all the dwellers round (13) to pay tribute exactly the amount
imposed in the days of Scopas. (14) And here in this state of accomplishment we may leave these
matters. I return to the point reached when this digression into the affairs of Jason began.

 (12) See "Cyrop." I. i. 5.

 (13) Lit. perioeci.

 (14) It is conjectured that the Scopadae ruled at Pherae and Cranusa
    in the earlier half of the fifth century B.C.; see, for the change
    of dynasty, what is said of Lycophron of Pherae in "Hell." II.
    iii. 4. There was a famous Scopas, son of Creon, to whom Simonides
    addressed his poem--

{Andr' agathon men alatheos genesthai khalepon khersin te kai posi kai noo tetragonon, aneu
psogou tetugmenon.}

a sentiment criticised by Plato, "Protag." 359 A. "Now Simonides says to Scopas, the son of
Creon, the Thessalian:

'Hardly on the one hand can a man become truly good; built four-square in hands and feet and
mind, a work without a flaw.'

Do you know the poem?"--Jowett, "Plat." i. 153. But whether this Scopas is the Scopas of our
text and a hero of Jason's is not clear.

II

B.C. 374. The Lacedaemonians and their allies were collecting in Phocia, and the Thebans, after
retreating into their own territory, were guarding the approaches. At this juncture the Athenians,
seeing the Thebans growing strong at their expense without contributing a single penny to the
maintenance of the fleet, while they themselves, what with money contributions, and piratical
attacks from Aegina, and the garrisoning of their territory, were being pared to the bone,
conceived a desire to cease from war. In this mood they sent an embassy to Lacedaemon and concluded
peace. (1)

 (1) See Curtius, "H. G." vol. iv. p. 376 (Eng. trans.)

B.C. 374-373. This done, two of the ambassadors, in obedience to a decree of the state, set
sail at once from Laconian territory, bearing orders to Timotheus to sail home, since peace
was established. That officer, while obeying his orders, availed himself of the homeward voyage
to land certain Zacynthian exiles (2) on their native soil, whereupon the Zacynthian city party
sent to Lacedaemon and complained of the treatment they had received from Timotheus; and the
Lacedaemonians, without further consideration, decided that the Athenians were in the wrong,
and proceeded to equip another navy, and at length collected from Laconia itself, from Corinth,
Leucas, (3) Ambracia, Elis, Zacynthus, Achaia, Epidaurus, Troezen, Hermione, and Halieis, a
force amounting to sixty sail. In command of this squadron they appointed Mnasippus admiral,
with orders to attack Corcyra, and in general to look after their interests in those seas.
They, moreover, sent an embassy to Dionysius, instructing him that his interests would be advanced
by the withdrawal of Corcyra from Athenian hands.

 (2) See Hicks, 81, p. 142.

 (3) Ibid. 81, 86.

B.C. 373. Accordingly Mnasippus set sail, as soon as his squadron was ready, direct to Corcyra;
he took with him, besides his troops from Lacedaemon, a body of mercenaries, making a total
in all of no less than fifteen hundred men. His disembarked, and soon became master of the
island, the country district falling a prey to the spoiler. It was in a high state of cultivation,
and rich with fruit-trees, not to speak of magnificent dwelling-houses and wine-cellars fitted
up on the farms: so that, it was said, the soldiers reached such a pitch of luxury that they
refused to drink wine which had not a fine bouquet. A crowd of slaves, too, and fat beasts
were captured on the estates.

The general's next move was to encamp with his land forces about three-quarters of a mile (4)
from the city district, so that any Corcyraean who attempted to leave the city to go into the
country would certainly be cut off on that side. The fleet he stationed on the other side of
the city, at a point where he calculated on detecting and preventing the approach of convoys.
Besides which he established a blockade in front of the harbour when the weather permitted.
In this way the city was completely invested.

 (4) Lit. "five stades."

The Corcyraeans, on their side, were in the sorest straits. They could get nothing from their
soil owing to the vice in which they were gripped by land, whilst owing to the predominance
of the enemy at sea nothing could be imported. Accordingly they sent to the Athenians and begged
for their assistance. They urged upon them that it would be a great mistake if they suffered
themselves to be robbed of Corcyra. If they did so, they would not only throw away a great
advantage to themselves, but add a considerable strength to their enemy; since, with the exception
of Athens, no state was capable of furnishing a larger fleet or revenue. Moreover, Corcyra
lay favourably (5) for commanding the Corinthian gulf and the cities which line its shores;
it was splendidly situated for injuring the rural districts of Laconia, and still more splendidly
in relation to the opposite shores of the continent of Epirus, and the passage between Peloponnesus
and Sicily.

 (5) See Thuc. i. 36.

This appeal did not fall on deaf ears. The Athenians were persuaded that the matter demanded
their most serious attention, and they at once despatched Stesicles as general, (6) with about
six hundred peltasts. They also requested Alcetas to help them in getting their troops across.
Thus under cover of night the whole body were conveyed across to a point in the open country,
and found their way into the city. Nor was that all. The Athenians passed a decree to man sixty
ships of war, and elected (7) Timotheus admiral. The latter, being unable to man the fleet
on the spot, set sail on a cruise to the islands and tried to make up the complements of his
crews from those quarters. He evidently looked upon it as no light matter to sail round Peloponnesus
as if on a voyage of pleasure, and to attack a fleet in the perfection of training. (8) To
the Athenians, however, it seemed that he was wasting the precious time seasonable for the
coastal voyage, and they were not disposed to condone such an error, but deposed him, appointing
Iphicrates in his stead. The new general was no sooner appointed than he set about getting
his vessels manned with the utmost activity, putting pressure on the trierarchs. He further
procured from the Athenians for his use not only any vessels cruising on the coast of Attica,
but the Paralus and Salaminia (9) also, remarking that, if things turned out well yonder, he
would soon send them back plenty of ships. Thus his numbers grew to something like seventy sail.

 (6) The name of the general was Ctesicles, according to Diod. xv. 47.

    foll.

Meanwhile the Corcyraeans were sore beset with famine: desertion became every day more frequent,
so much so that Mnasippus caused proclamation to be made by herald that all deserters would
be sold there and then; (10) and when that had no effect in lessening the stream of runaways,
he ended by driving them back with the lash. Those within the walls, however, were not disposed
to receive these miserable slaves within the lines, and numbers died outside. Mnasippus, not
blind to what was happening, soon persuaded himself that he had as good as got the city into
his possession: and he began to try experiments on his mercenaries. Some of them he had already
paid off; (11) others still in his service had as much as two months' pay owing to them by
the general, who, if report spoke true, had no lack of money, since the majority of the states,
not caring for a campaign across the seas, sent him hard cash instead of men. But now the beleaguered
citizens, who could espy from their towers that the outposts were less carefully guarded than
formerly, and the men scattered about the rural districts, made a sortie, capturing some and
cutting down others. Mnasippus, perceiving the attack, donned his armour, and, with all the
heavy troops he had, rushed to the rescue, giving orders to the captains and brigadiers (12)
to lead out the mercenaries. Some of the captains answered that it was not so easy to command
obedience when the necessaries of life were lacking; whereat the Spartan struck one man with
his staff, and another with the butt of his spear. Without spirit and full of resentment against
their general, the men mustered--a condition very unfavourable to success in battle. Having
drawn up the troops, the general in person repulsed the division of the enemy which was opposite
the gates, and pursued them closely; but these, rallying close under their walls, turned right
about, and from under cover of the tombs kept up a continuous discharge of darts and other
missiles; other detachments, dashing out at other gates, meanwhile fell heavily on the flanks
of the enemy. The Lacedaemonians, being drawn up eight deep, and thinking that the wing of
their phalanx was of inadequate strength, essayed to wheel around; but as soon as they began
the movement the Corcyraeans attacked them as if they were fleeing, and they were then unable
to recover themselves, (13) while the troops next in position abandoned themselves to flight.
Mnasippus, unable to succour those who were being pressed owing to the attack of the enemy
immediately in front, found himself left from moment to moment with decreasing numbers. At
last the Corcyraeans collected, and with one united effort made a final rush upon Mnasippus
and his men, whose numbers were now considerably reduced. At the same instant the townsmen,
(14) eagerly noticing the posture of affairs, rushed out to play their part. First Mnasippus
was slain, and then the pursuit became general; nor could the pursuers well have failed to
capture the camp, barricade and all, had they not caught sight of the mob of traffickers with
a long array of attendants and slaves, and thinking that here was a prize indeed, desisted
from further chase.

 (10) Or, "he would knock them all down to the hammer."

 (11) Or, "cut off from their pay."

 (12) Lit. "lochagoi and taxiarchs."

 (13) Or, "to retaliate"; or, "to complete the movement."

 (14) Reading, after Dindorf, {oi politai}, or, if with the MSS., {oi
    oplitai}; translate "the heavy-armed among the assailants saw
    their advantage and pressed on."

The Corcyraeans were well content for the moment to set up a trophy and to give back the enemy's
dead under a flag of truce; but the after-consequences were even more important to them in
the revival of strength and spirits which were sunk in despondency. The rumour spread that
Iphicrates would soon be there--he was even at the doors; and in fact the Corcyraeans themselves
were manning a fleet. So Hypermenes, who was second in command to Mnasippus and the bearer
of his despatches, manned every vessel of the fleet as full as it would hold, and then sailing
round to the entrenched camp, filled all the transports with prisoners and valuables and other
stock, and sent them off. He himself, with his marines and the survivors of his troops, kept
watch over the entrenchments; but at last even this remnant in the excess of panic and confusion
got on board the men-of-war and sailed off, leaving behind them vast quantities of corn and
wine, with numerous prisoners and invalided soldiers. The fact was, they were sorely afraid
of being caught by the Athenians in the island, and so they made safely off to Leucas.

Meanwhile Iphicrates had commenced his voyage of circumnavigation, partly voyaging and partly
making every preparation for an engagement. He at once left his large sails behind him, as
the voyage was only to be the prelude of a battle; his flying jibs, even if there was a good
breeze, were but little used, since by making his progress depend on sheer rowing, he hoped
at once to improve the physique of his men and the speed of his attack. Often when the squadron
was about to put into shore for the purpose of breakfast or supper, he would seize the moment,
and draw back the leading wing of the column from the land off the point in question; and then
facing round again with the triremes posted well in line, prow for prow, at a given signal
let loose the whole fleet in a stoutly contested race for the shore. Great was the triumph
in being the first to take in water or whatever else they might need, or the first to breakfast;
just as it was a heavy penalty on the late-comers, not only to come short in all these objects
of desire, but to have to put out to sea with the rest as soon as the signal was given; since
the first-comers had altogether a quiet time of it, whilst the hindmost must get through the
whole business in hot haste. So again, in the matter of outposts, if he chanced to be getting
the morning meal on hostile territory, pickets would be posted, as was right and proper, on
the land; but, apart from these, he would raise his masts and keep look-out men on the maintops.
These commanded of course a far wider prospect from their lofty perches than the outposts on
the level ground. So too, when he dined or slept he had no fires burning in the camp at night,
but only a beacon kindled in front of the encampment to prevent any unseen approach; and frequently
in fine weather he put out to sea immediately after the evening meal, when, if the breeze favoured,
they ran along and took their rest simultaneously, or if they depended on oars he gave his
mariners repose by turns. During the voyage in daytime he would at one time signal to "sail
in column," and at another signal "abreast in line." So that whilst they prosecuted the voyage
they at the same time became (both as to theory and practice) well versed in all the details
of an engagement before they reached the open sea--a sea, as they imagined, occupied by their
foes. For the most part they breakfasted and dined on hostile territory; but as he confined
himself to bare necessaries he was always too quick for the enemy. Before the hostile reinforcement
would come up he had finished his business and was out to sea again.

At the date of Mnasippus's death he chanced to be off Sphagiae in Laconian territory. Reaching
Elis, and coasting past the mouth of the Alpheus, he came to moorings under Cape Ichthus, (15)
as it is called. The next day he put out from that port for Cephallenia, so drawing up his
line and conducting the voyage that he might be prepared in every detail to engage if necessary.
The tale about Mnasippus and his demise had reached him, but he had not heard it from an eye-witness,
and suspected that it might have been invented to deceive him and throw him off his guard.
He was therefore on the look-out. It was, in fact, only on arrival in Cephallenia that he learned
the news in an explicit form, and gave his troops rest.

 (15) Cape Fish, mod. Cape Katakolon, protecting harbour of Pyrgos in
    Elis.

I am well aware that all these details of practice and manouvring are customary in anticipation
of a sea-fight, but what I single out for praise in the case before us is the skill with which
the Athenian admiral attained a twofold object. Bearing in mind that it was his duty to reach
a certain point at which he expected to fight a naval battle without delay, it was a happy
discovery on his part not to allow tactical skill, on the one hand, to be sacrificed to the
pace of sailing, (16) nor, on the other, the need of training to interfere with the date of
arrival.

 (16) Lit. "the voyage."

After reducing the towns of Cephallenia, Iphicrates sailed to Corcyra. There the first news
he heard was that the triremes sent by Dionysius were expected to relieve the Lacedaemonians.
On receipt of this information he set off in person and surveyed the country, in order to find
a spot from which it would be possible to see the vessels approaching and to signal to the
city. Here he stationed his look-out men. A code of signals was agreed upon to signify "vessels
in sight," "mooring," etc.; which done he gave his orders to twenty of his captains of men-of-war
who were to follow him at a given word of command. Any one who failed to follow him must not
grumble at the penalty; that he warned them. Presently the vessels were signalled approaching;
the word of command was given, and then the enthusiasm was a sight to see--every man of the
crews told off for the expedition racing to join his ship and embark. Sailing to the point
where the enemy's vessels lay, he had no difficulty in capturing the crews, who had disembarked
from all the ships with one exception. The exception was that of Melanippus the Rhodian, who
had advised the other captains not to stop at this point, and had then manned his own vessel
and sailed off. Thus he encountered the ships of Iphicrates, but contrived to slip through
his fingers, while the whole of the Syracusan vessels were captured, crews and all.

Having cut the beaks off the prows, Iphicrates bore down into the harbour of Corcyra with the
captured triremes in tow. With the captive crews themselves he came to an agreement that each
should pay a fixed sum as ransom, with one exception, that of Crinippus, their commander. Him
he kept under guard, with the intention apparently of exacting a handsome sum in his case or
else of selling him. The prisoner, however, from vexation of spirit, put an end to his own
life. The rest were sent about their business by Iphicrates, who accepted the Corcyraeans as
sureties for the money. His own sailors he supported for the most part as labourers on the
lands of the Corcyraeans, while at the head of his light infantry and the hoplites of the contingent
he crossed over into Acarnania, and there lent his aid to any friendly state that needed his
services; besides which he went to war with the Thyrians, (17) a sturdy race of warriors in
possession of a strong fortress.

 (17) Thyreum (or Thyrium), in Acarnania, a chief city at the time of
    the Roman wars in Greece; and according to Polybius (xxxviii. 5),
    a meeting-place of the League on one occasion. See "Dict. Anct.
    Geog." s.v.; Freeman, op. cit. iv. 148; cf. Paus. IV. xxvi. 3, in

B.C. 372. Having attached to his squadron the navy also of Corcyra, with a fleet numbering
now about ninety ships he set sail, in the first instance to Cephallenia, where he exacted
money--which was in some cases voluntarily paid, in others forcibly extorted. In the next place
he began making preparations partly to harass the territory of the Lacedaemonians, and partly
to win over voluntarily the other states in that quarter which were hostile to Athens; or in
case of refusal to go to war with them.

The whole conduct of the campaign reflects, I think, the highest credit on Iphicrates. If his
strategy was admirable, so too was the instinct which led him to advise the association with
himself of two such colleagues as Callistratus and Chabrias--the former a popular orator but
no great friend of himself politically, (18) the other a man of high military reputation. Either
he looked upon them as men of unusual sagacity, and wished to profit by their advice, in which
case I commend the good sense of the arrangement, or they were, in his belief, antagonists,
in which case the determination to approve himself a consummate general, neither indolent nor
incautious, was bold, I admit, but indicative of a laudable self-confidence. Here, however,
we must part with Iphicrates and his achievements to return to Athens.

The Athenians, forced to witness the expatriation from Boeotia of their friends the Plataeans
(who had sought an asylum with themselves), forced also to listen to the supplications of the
Thespiaeans (who begged them not to suffer them to be robbed of their city), could no longer
regard the Thebans with favour; (1) though, when it came to a direct declaration of war, they
were checked in part by a feeling of shame, and partly by considerations of expediency. Still,
to go hand in hand with them, to be a party to their proceedings, this they absolutely refused,
now that they saw them marching against time-honoured friends of the city like the Phocians,
and blotting out states whose loyalty in the great Persian war was conspicuous no less than
their friendship to Athens. Accordingly the People passed a decree to make peace; but in the
first instance they sent an embassy to Thebes, inviting that state to join them if it pleased
them on an embassy which they proposed to send to Lacedaemon to treat of peace. In the next
place they despatched such an embassy on their own account. Among the commissioners appointed
were Callias the son of Hipponicus, Autocles the son of Strombichides, Demostratus the son
of Aristophon, Aristocles, Cephisodotus, (2) Melanopus, and Lycaethus.

B.C. 371. (These were formally introduced to the Deputies of the Lacedaemonians and the allies.
(3)) Nor ought the name of Callistratus to be omitted. That statesman and orator was present.
He had obtained furlough from Iphicrates on an undertaking either to send money for the fleet
or to arrange a peace. Hence his arrival in Athens and transactions in behalf of peace. After
being introduced to the assembly (4) of the Lacedaemonians and to the allies, Callias, (5)
who was the dadouchos (or torch-holder) in the mysteries, made the first speech. He was a man
just as well pleased to praise himself as to hear himself praised by others. He opened the
proceedings as follows:

    they are a note by the author.

    and the same person he must have been an elderly man at this date,
    371 B.C.

"Lacedaemonians, the duty of representing you as proxenos at Athens is a privilege which I
am not the first member of my family to enjoy; my father's father held it as an heirloom of
our family and handed it down as a heritage to his descendants. If you will permit me, I should
like to show you the disposition of my fatherland towards yourselves. If in times of war she
chooses us as her generals, so when her heart is set upon quiet she sends us out as her messengers
of peace. I myself have twice already (6) stood here to treat for conclusion of war, and on
both embassies succeeded in arranging a mutually agreeable peace. Now for the third time I
am come, and I flatter myself that to-day again I shall obtain a reconciliation, and on grounds
exceptionally just. My eyes bear witness that our hearts are in accord; you and we alike are
pained at the effacement of Plataeae and Thespiae. Is it not then reasonable that out of agreement
should spring concord rather than discord? It is never the part, I take it, of wise men to
raise the standard of war for the sake of petty differences; but where there is nothing but
unanimity they must be marvellous folk who refuse the bond of peace. But I go further. It were
just and right on our parts even to refuse to bear arms against each other; since, as the story
runs, the first strangers to whom our forefather Triptolemus showed the unspeakable mystic
rites of Demeter and Core, the mother and the maiden, were your ancestors;--I speak of Heracles,
the first founder of your state, and of your two citizens, the great twin sons of Zeus--and
to Peloponnesus first he gave as a gift the seed of Demeter's corn-fruits. How, then, can it
be just or right either that you should come and ravage the corn crops of those from whom you
got the sacred seed of corn, or that we should not desire that they to whom the gift was given
should share abundantly of this boon? But if, as it would seem, it is a fixed decree of heaven
that war shall never cease among men, yet ought we--your people and our people--to be as slow
as possible to begin it, and being in it, as swift as possible to bring it to an end."

 (6) B.C. 387 and 374; see Curtius, "H. G." vol. iv. p. 376 (Eng. ed.)

After him Autocles (7) spoke: he was of repute as a versatile lawyer and orator, and addressed
the meeting as follows: "Lacedaemonians, I do not conceal from myself that what I am about
to say is not calculated to please you, but it seems to me that, if you wish the friendship
which we are cementing to last as long as possible, we are wise to show each other the underlying
causes of our wars. Now, you are perpetually saying that the states ought to be independent;
but it is you yourselves who most of all stand in the way of independence--your first and last
stipulation with the allied states being that they should follow you whithersoever you choose
to lead; and yet what has this principle of follow-my-leader got to do with independent action?
(8) Again, you pick quarrels without consulting your allies, and lead them against those whom
you account enemies; so that in many cases, with all their vaunted independence, they are forced
to march against their greatest friends; and, what is still more opposed to independence than
all else, you are for ever setting up here your decarchies and there your thirty commissioners,
and your chief aim in appointing these officers and governors seems to be, not that they should
fulfil their office and govern legally, but that they should be able to keep the cities under
their heels by sheer force. So that it looks as if you delighted in despotisms rather than
free constitutions. Let us go back to the date (9) at which the Persian king enjoined the independence
of the states. At that time you made no secret of your conviction that the Thebans, if they
did not suffer each state to govern itself and to use the laws of its own choice, would be
failing to act in the spirit of the king's rescript. But no sooner had you got hold of Cadmeia
than you would not suffer the Thebans themselves to be independent. Now, if the maintenance
of friendship be an object, it is no use for people to claim justice from others while they
themselves are doing all they can to prove the selfishness of their aims."

 (7) For the political views of Autocles, see Curtius, "H. G." iv. 387,
    v. 94 (Eng. tr.); see also Grote, "H. G." x. 225.

 (8) Or, "what consistency is there between these precepts of yours and
    political independence?"

 (9) Sixteen years before--B.C. 387. See "Pol. Lac." xiv. 5.

These remarks were received in absolute silence, yet in the hearts of those who were annoyed
with Lacedaemon they stirred pleasure. After Autocles spoke Callistratus: "Trespasses, men
of Lacedaemon, have been committed on both sides, yours and ours, I am free to confess; but
still it is not my view that because a man has done wrong we can never again have dealings
with him. Experience tells me that no man can go very far without a slip, and it seems to me
that sometimes the transgressor by reason of his transgression becomes more tractable, especially
if he be chastened through the error he has committed, as has been the case with us. And so
on your own case I see that ungenerous acts have sometimes reaped their own proper reward:
blow has been met by counter-blow; and as a specimen I take the seizure of the Cadmeia in Thebes.
To-day, at any rate, the very cities whose independence you strove for have, since your unrighteous
treatment of Thebes, fallen one and all of them again into her power. (10) We are schooled
now, both of us, to know that grasping brings not gain. We are prepared, I hope, to be once
more moderate under the influence of a mutual friendship. Some, I know, in their desire to
render our peace (11) abortive accuse us falsely, as though we were come hither, not seeking
friendship, but because we dread the arrival of some (12) Antalcidas with moneys from the king.
But consider, what arrant nonsense they talk! Was it not, pray, the great king who demanded
that all the states in Hellas should be independent? and what have we Athenians, who are in
full agreement with the king, both in word and deed, to fear from him? Or is it conceivable
that he prefers spending money in making others great to finding his favourite projects realised
without expense?

 (10) Reading, with Breitenbach and Hartman, {as} instead of {os
    espoudasate k.t.l.}

 (11) Or, more lit. "to avert the peace" as an ill-omened thing.

 (12) Without inserting {tis}, as Hartman proposes ("An. Xen." p. 387),
    that, I think, is the sense. Antalcidas is the arch-diplomat--a
    name to conjure with, like that of Bismarck in modern European
    politics. But see Grote, "H. G." x. 213, note 2.

"Well! what is it really that has brought us here? No especial need or difficulty in our affairs.
That you may discover by a glance at our maritime condition, or, if you prefer, at the present
posture of our affairs on land. Well, then, how does the matter stand? It is obvious that some
of our allies please us no better than they please you; (13) and, possibly, in return for your
former preservation of us, we may be credited with a desire to point out to you the soundness
of our policy.

 (13) See, for this corrupt passage, Otto Keller, op. cit. p. 219;
    Hartman, op. cit. p. 387; and Breitenbach, n. ad loc. In the next
    sentence I should like to adopt Hartman's emendation (ib.) {on
    orthos egnote} for the MSS. {a orthos egnomen}, and translate "we
    may like to prove to you the soundness of your policy at the
    time." For the "preservation" referred to, see below, VI. v. 35,
    and above, II. ii. 20.

"But, to revert once more to the topic of expediency and common interests. It is admitted,
I presume, that, looking at the states collectively, half support your views, half ours; and
in every single state one party is for Sparta and another for Athens. Suppose, then, we were
to shake hands, from what quarter can we reasonably anticipate danger and trouble? To put the
case in so many words, so long as you are our friends no one can vex us by land; no one, whilst
we are your supports, can injure you by sea. Wars like tempests gather and grow to a head from
time to time, and again they are dispelled. That we all know. Some future day, if not to-day,
we shall crave, both of us, for peace. Why, then, need we wait for that moment, holding on
until we expire under the multitude of our ills, rather than take time by the forelock and,
before some irremediable mischief betide, make peace? I cannot admire the man who, because
he has entered the lists and has scored many a victory and obtained to himself renown, is so
eaten up with the spirit of rivalry that he must needs go on until he is beaten and all his
training is made futile. Nor again do I praise the gambler who, if he makes one good stroke
of luck, insists on doubling the stakes. Such conduct in the majority of cases must end in
absolute collapse. Let us lay the lesson of these to heart, and forbear to enter into any such
lists as theirs for life or death; but, while we are yet in the heyday of our strength and
fortune, shake hands in mutual amity. So assuredly shall we through you and you through us
attain to an unprecedented pinnacle of glory throughout Hellas."

The arguments of the speakers were approved, and the Lacedaemonians passed a resolution to
accept peace on a threefold basis: the withdrawal of the governors from the cities, (14) the
disbanding of armaments naval and military, and the guarantee of independence to the states.
"If any state transgressed these stipulations, it lay at the option of any power whatsoever
to aid the states so injured, while, conversely, to bring such aid was not compulsory on any
power against its will." On these terms the oaths were administered and accepted by the Lacedaemonians
on behalf of themselves and their allies, and by the Athenians and their allies separately
state by state. The Thebans had entered their individual name among the states which accepted
the oaths, but their ambassadors came the next day with instructions to alter the name of the
signatories, substituting for Thebans Boeotians. (15) But Agesilaus answered to this demand
that he would alter nothing of what they had in the first instance sworn to and subscribed.
If they did not wish to be included in the treaty, he was willing to erase their name at their
bidding. So it came to pass that the rest of the world made peace, the sole point of dispute
being confined to the Thebans; and the Athenians came to the conclusion that there was a fair
prospect of the Thebans being now literally decimated. (16) As to the Thebans themselves, they
retired from Sparta in utter despondency.

 (14) Grote ("H. G." x. 236) thinks that Diod. xv. 38 ({exagogeis})
    belongs to this time, not to the peace between Athens and Sparta
    in 374 B.C.

 (15) See, for a clear explanation of the matter, Freeman, "Hist. Red.
    Gov." iv. p. 175, note 3, in reference to Grote, ib. x. 231 note,
    and Paus. IX. xiii. 2; Plut. "Ages." 28; Thirlwall, "H. G." v. p
    69 note.

 (16) Or, "as the saying is, taken and tithed." See below, VI. v. 35,
    and for the origin of the saying, Herod. vii. 132.

IV

In consequence of the peace the Athenians proceeded to withdraw their garrisons from the different
sates, and sent to recall Iphicrates with his fleet; besides which they forced him to restore
everything captured subsequently to the late solemn undertaking at Lacedaemon. The Lacedaemonians
acted differently. Although they withdrew their governors and garrisons from the other states,
in Phocis they did not do so. Here Cleombrotus was quartered with his army, and had sent to
ask directions from the home authorities. A speaker, Prothous, maintained that their business
was to disband the army in accordance with their oaths, and then to send round invitations
to the states to contribute what each felt individually disposed, and lay such sum in the temple
of Apollo; after which, if any attempt to hinder the independence of the states on any side
were manifested, it would be time enough then again to invite all who cared to protect the
principle of autonomy to march against its opponents. "In this way," he added, "I think the
goodwill of heaven will be secured, and the states will suffer least annoyance." But the Assembly,
on hearing these views, agreed that this man was talking nonsense. Puppets in the hands of
fate! (1) An unseen power, it would seem, was already driving them onwards; so they sent instructions
to Cleombrotus not to disband the army, but to march straight against the Thebans if they refused
to recognise the autonomy of the states. (Cleombrotus, it is understood, had, on hearing the
news of the establishment of peace, sent to the ephorate to ask for guidance; and then they
sent him the above instructions, bidding him under the circumstances named to march upon Thebes.
(2))

 (1) See Grote, "H. G." x. 237: "The miso-Theban impulse now drove them
    on with a fury which overcame all other thoughts... a
    misguiding inspiration sent by the gods--like that of the Homeric
    Ate."

 (2) This passage reads like an earlier version for which the above was
    substituted by the author.

The Spartan king soon perceived that, so far from leaving the Boeotian states their autonomy,
the Thebans were not even preparing to disband their army, clearly in view of a general engagement;
he therefore felt justified in marching his troops into Boeotia. The point of ingress which
he adopted was not that which the Thebans anticipated from Phocis, and where they were keeping
guard at a defile; but, marching through Thisbae by a mountainous and unsuspected route, he
arrived before Creusis, taking that fortress and capturing twelve Theban war-vessels besides.
After this achievement he advanced from the seaboard and encamped in Leuctra on Thespian territory.
The Thebans encamped in a rising ground immediately opposite at no great distance, and were
supported by no allies except the Boeotians.

At this juncture the friends of Cleombrotus came to him and urged upon him strong reasons for
delivering battle. "If you let the Thebans escape without a battle," they said, "you will run
great risks of suffering the extreme penalty at the hands of the state. People will call to
mind against you the time when you reached Cynoscephelae and did not ravage a square foot of
Theban territory; and again, a subsequent expedition when you were driven back foiled in your
attempt to make an entry into the enemy's country--while Agesilaus on each occasion found his
entry by Mount Cithaeron. If then you have any care for yourself, or any attachment to your
fatherland, march you against the enemy." That was what his friends urged. As to his opponents,
what they said was, "Now our fine friend will show whether he really is so concerned on behalf
of the Thebans as he is said to be."

Cleombrotus, with these words ringing in his ears, felt driven (3) to join battle. On their
side the leaders of Thebes calculated that, if they did not fight, their provincial cities
(4) would hold aloof from them and Thebes itself would be besieged; while, if the commonalty
of Thebes failed to get supplies, there was every prospect that the city itself would turn
against them; and, seeing that many of them had already tasted the bitterness of exile, they
came to the conclusion that it was better for them to die on the field of battle than to renew
that experience. Besides this they were somewhat encouraged by the recital of an oracle which
predicted that the Lacedaemonians would be defeated on the spot where the monument of the maidens
stood, who, as the story goes, being violated by certain Lacedaemonians, had slain themselves.
(5) This sepulchral monument the Thebans decked with ornaments before the battle. Furthermore,
tidings were brought them from the city that all the temples had opened of their own accord;
and the priestesses asserted that the gods revealed victory. Again, from the Heracleion men
said that the arms had disappeared, as though Heracles himself had sallied forth to battle.
It is true that another interpretation (6) of these marvels made them out to be one and all
the artifices of the leaders of Thebes. However this may be, everything in the battle turned
out adverse to the Lacedaemonians; while fortune herself lent aid to the Thebans and crowned
their efforts with success. Cleombrotus held his last council "whether to fight or not," after
the morning meal. In the heat of noon a little goes a long way; and the people said that it
took a somewhat provocative effect on their spirits. (7)

 (3) Or, "was provoked."

 (4) Lit. "perioecid." See Thuc. iv. 76, Arnold's note, and "Hell." V.
    iv. 46, 63.

 (5) See Diod. xv. 54; Paus. IX. xiii. 3; Plut. "Pelop." xx.

 (6) Or, "it is true that some people made out these marvels."

 (7) Or, "they were somewhat excited by it."

Both sides were now arming, and there was the unmistakeable signs of approaching battle, when,
as the first incident, there issued from the Boeotian lines a long train bent on departure--these
were the furnishers of the market, a detachment of baggage bearers, and in general such people
as had no inclination to join in the fight. These were met on their retreat and attacked by
the mercenary troops under Hiero, who got round them by a circular movement. (8) The mercenaries
were supported by the Phocian light infantry and some squadrons of Heracleot and Phliasian
cavalry, who fell upon the retiring train and turned them back, pursuing them and driving them
into the camp of the Boeotians. The immediate effect was to make the Boeotian portion of the
army more numerous and closer packed than before. The next feature of the combat was that in
consequence of the flat space of plain (9) between the opposing armies, the Lacedaemonians
posted their cavalry in front of their squares of infantry, and the Thebans followed suit.
Only there was this difference--the Theban cavalry was in a high state of training and efficiency,
owing to their war with the Orchomenians and again their war with Thespiae, whilst the cavalry
of the Lacedaemonians was at its worst at this period. (10) The horses were reared and kept
by the wealthiest members of the state; but whenever the ban was called out, an appointed trooper
appeared who took the horse with any sort of arms which might be presented to him, and set
off on the expedition at a moment's notice. Moreover, these troopers were the least able-bodied
of the men: raw recruits set simply astride their horses, and devoid of soldierly ambition.
Such was the cavalry of either antagonist.

 (8) Or, "surrounded them."

 (9) See Rustow and Kochly, op. cit. p. 173.

 (10) See "Hipparch." ix. 4; also "Cyrop." VIII. viii.

The heavy infantry of the Lacedaemonians, it is said, advanced by sections three files abreast,
(11) allowing a total depth to the whole line of not more than twelve. The Thebans were formed
in close order of not less than fifty shields deep, calculating that victory gained over the
king's division of the army implied the easy conquest of the rest.

 (11) It would appear that the "enomoty" (section) numbered thirty-six
    files. See "Pol. Lac." xi. 4; xiii. 4. For further details as to
    the tactical order of the Thebans, see Diod. xv. 55; Plut.
    "Pelop." xxiii.

Cleombrotus had hardly begun to lead his division against the foe when, before in fact the
troops with him were aware of his advance, the cavalry had already come into collision, and
that of the Lacedaemonians was speedily worsted. In their flight they became involved with
their own heavy infantry; and to make matters worse, the Theban regiments were already attacking
vigorously. Still strong evidence exists for supposing that Cleombrotus and his division were,
in the first instance, victorious in the battle, if we consider the fact that they could never
have picked him up and brought him back alive unless his vanguard had been masters of the situation
for the moment.

When, however, Deinon the polemarch and Sphodrias, a member of the king's council, with his
son Cleonymus, (12) had fallen, then it was that the cavalry and the polemarch's adjutants,
(13) as they are called, with the rest, under pressure of the mass against them, began retreating;
and the left wing of the Lacedaemonians, seeing the right borne down in this way, also swerved.
Still, in spite of the numbers slain, and broken as they were, as soon as they had crossed
the trench which protected their camp in front, they grounded arms on the spot (14) whence
they had rushed to battle. This camp, it must be borne in mind, did not lie at all on the level,
but was pitched on a somewhat steep incline. At this juncture there were some of the Lacedaemonians
who, looking upon such a disaster as intolerable, maintained that they ought to prevent the
enemy from erecting a trophy, and try to recover the dead not under a flag of truce but by
another battle. The polemarchs, however, seeing that nearly a thousand men of the total Lacedaemonian
troops were slain; seeing also that of the seven hundred Spartans themselves who were on the
field something like four hundred lay dead; (15) aware, further, of the despondency which reigned
among the allies, and the general disinclination on their parts to fight longer (a frame of
mind not far removed in some instances from positive satisfaction at what had taken place)--under
the circumstances, I say, the polemarchs called a council of the ablest representatives of
the shattered army (16) and deliberated as to what should be done. Finally the unanimous opinion
was to pick up the dead under a flag of truce, and they sent a herald to treat for terms. The
Thebans after that set up a trophy and gave back the bodies under a truce.

After these events, a messenger was despatched to Lacedaemon with news of the calamity. He
reached his destination on the last day of the gymnopaediae, (17) just when the chorus of grown
men had entered the theatre. The ephors heard the mournful tidings not without grief and pain,
as needs they must, I take it; but for all that they did not dismiss the chorus, but allowed
the contest to run out its natural course. What they did was to deliver the names of those
who had fallen to their friends and families, with a word of warning to the women not to make
any loud lamentations but to bear their sorrow in silence; and the next day it was a striking
spectacle to see those who had relations among the slain moving to and fro in public with bright
and radiant looks, whilst of those whose friends were reported to be living barely a man was
to be seen, and these flitted by with lowered heads and scowling brows, as if in humiliation.

 (17) The festival was celebrated annually about midsummer. See Herod.
    vi. 67; Thuc. v. 82, and Arnold's note; Pollux. iv. 105; Athen.
    xiv. 30, xv. 22; Muller, "Dorians," ii. 389.

After this the ephors proceeded to call out the ban, including the forty-years-service men
of the two remaining regiments; (18) and they proceeded further to despatch the reserves of
the same age belonging to the six regiments already on foreign service. Hitherto the Phocian
campaign had only drawn upon the thirty-five-years-service list. Besides these they now ordered
out on active service the troops retained at the beginning of the campaign in attendance on
the magistrates at the government offices. Agesilaus being still disabled by his infirmity,
the city imposed the duty of command upon his son Archidamus. The new general found eager co-operators
in the men of Tegea. The friends of Stasippus at this date were still living, (19) and they
were stanch in their Lacedaemonian proclivities, and wielded considerable power in their state.
Not less stoutly did the Mantineans from their villages under their aristocratic form of government
flock to the Spartan standard. Besides Tegea and Mantinea, the Corinthians and Sicyonians,
the Phliasians and Achaeans were equally enthusiastic to joining the campaign, whilst other
states sent out soldiers. Then came the fitting out and manning of ships of war on the part
of the Lacedaemonians themselves and of the Corinthians, whilst the Sicyonians were requested
to furnish a supply of vessels on board of which it was proposed to transport the army across
the gulf. And so, finally, Archidamus was able to offer the sacrifices usual at the moment
of crossing the frontier. But to return to Thebes.

 (18) I.e. every one up to fifty-eight years of age.

 (19) See below, VI. v. 9.

Immediately after the battle the Thebans sent a messenger to Athens wearing a chaplet. Whilst
insisting on the magnitude of the victory they at the same time called upon the Athenians to
send them aid, for now the opportunity had come to wreak vengeance on the Lacedaemonians for
all the evil they had done to Athens. As it chanced, the senate of the Athenians was holding
a session on the Acropolis. As soon as the news was reported, the annoyance caused by its announcement
was unmistakeable. They neither invited the herald to accept of hospitality nor sent back one
word in reply to the request for assistance. And so the herald turned his back on Athens and
departed.

But there was Jason still to look to, and he was their ally. To him then the Thebans sent,
and earnestly besought his aid, their thoughts running on the possible turn which events might
take. Jason on his side at once proceeded to man a fleet, with the apparent intention of sending
assistance by sea, besides which he got together his foreign brigade and his own cavalry; and
although the Phocians and he were implacable enemies, (20) he marched through their territory
to Boeotia. Appearing like a vision to many of the states before his approach was even announced--at
any rate before levies could be mustered from a dozen different points--he had stolen a march
upon them and was a long way ahead, giving proof that expedition is sometimes a better tool
to work with than sheer force.

 (20) Or, "though the Phocians maintained a war 'a outrance' with him."

When he arrived in Boeotia the Thebans urged upon him that now was the right moment to attack
the Lacedaemonians: he with his foreign brigade from the upper ground, they face to face in
front; but Jason dissuaded them from their intention. He reminded them that after a noble achievement
won it was not worth their while to play for so high a stake, involving a still greater achievement
or else the loss of victory already gained. "Do you not see," he urged, "that your success
followed close on the heels of necessity? You ought then to reflect that the Lacedaemonians
in their distress, with a choice between life and death, will fight it out with reckless desperation.
Providence, as it seems, ofttimes delights to make the little ones great and the great ones
small." (21)

 (21) Cf. "Anab." III. ii. 10.

By such arguments he diverted the Thebans from the desperate adventure. But for the Lacedaemonians
also he had words of advice, insisting on the difference between an army defeated and an army
flushed with victory. "If you are minded," he said, "to forget this disaster, my advice to
you is to take time to recover breath and recruit your energies. When you have grown stronger
then give battle to these unconquered veterans. (22) At present," he continued, "you know without
my telling you that among your own allies there are some who are already discussing terms of
friendship with your foes. My advice is this: by all means endeavour to obtain a truce. This,"
he added, "is my own ambition: I want to save you, on the ground of my father's friendship
with yourselves, and as being myself your representative." (23) Such was the tenor of his speech,
but the secret of action was perhaps to be found in a desire to make these mutual antagonists
put their dependence on himself alone. Whatever his motive, the Lacedaemonians took his advice,
and commissioned him to procure a truce.

 (22) Or, "the invincibles."

 (23) Lit. "your proxenos."

As soon as the news arrived that the terms were arranged, the polemarchs passed an order round:
the troops were to take their evening meal, get their kit together, and be ready to set off
that night, so as to scale the passes of Cithaeron by next morning. After supper, before the
hour of sleep, the order to march was given, and with the generals at their head the troops
advanced as the shades of evening fell, along the road to Creusis, trusting rather to the chance
of their escaping notice, than to the truce itself. It was weary marching in the dead of night,
making their retreat in fear, and along a difficult road, until they fell in with Archidamus's
army of relief. At this point, then, Archidamus waited till all the allies had arrived, and
so led the whole of the united armies back to Corinth, from which point he dismissed the allies
and led his fellow-citizens home.

Jason took his departure from Boeotia through Phocis, where he captured the suburbs of Hyampolis
(24) and ravaged the country districts, putting many to the sword. Content with this, he traversed
the rest of Phocis without meddling or making. Arrived at Heraclea, (25) he knocked down the
fortress of the Heracleots, showing that he was not troubled by any apprehension lest when
the pass was thrown open somebody or other might march against his own power at some future
date. Rather was he haunted by the notion that some one or other might one day seize Heraclea,
which commanded the pass, and bar his passage into Hellas--should Hellas ever be his goal.
(26) At the moment of his return to Thessaly he had reached the zenith of his greatness. He
was the lawfully constituted Prince (27) of Thessaly, and he had under him a large mercenary
force of infantry and cavalry, and all in the highest perfection of training. For this twofold
reason he might claim the title great. But he was still greater as the head of a vast alliance.
Those who were prepared to fight his battles were numerous, and he might still count upon the
help of many more eager to do so; but I call Jason greatest among his contemporaries, because
not one among them could afford to look down upon him. (28)

B.C. 370. The Pythian games were now approaching, and an order went round the cities from Jason
to make preparation for the solemn sacrifice of oxen, sheep and goats, and swine. It was reported
that although the requisitions upon the several cities were moderate, the number of beeves
did not fall short of a thousand, while the rest of the sacrificial beasts exceeded ten times
that number. He issued a proclamation also to this effect: a golden wreath of victory should
be given to whichever city could produce the best-bred bull to head the procession in honour
of the god. And lastly there was an order issued to all the Thessalians to be ready for a campaign
at the date of the Pythian games. His intention, as people said, was to act as manager of the
solemn assembly and games in person. What the thought was that passed through his mind with
reference to the sacred money, remains to this day uncertain; only, a tale is rife to the effect
that in answer to the inquiry of the Delphians, "What ought we to do, if he takes any of the
treasures of the god?" the god made answer, "He would see to that himself." This great man,
his brain teeming with vast designs of this high sort, came now to his end. He had ordered
a military inspection. The cavalry of the Pheraeans were to pass muster before him. He was
already seated, delivering answers to all petitioners, when seven striplings approached, quarrelling,
as it seemed, about some matter. Suddenly by these seven the Prince was despatched; his throat
gashed, his body gored with wounds. Stoutly his guard rushed to the rescue with their long
spears, and one of the seven, while still in the act of aiming a blow at Jason, was thrust
through with a lance and died; a second, in the act of mounting his horse, was caught, and
dropped dead, the recipient of many wounds. The rest leaped on the horses which they had ready
waiting and escaped. To whatever city of Hellas they came honours were almost universally accorded
them. The whole incident proves clearly that the Hellenes stood in much alarm of Jason. They
looked upon him as a tyrant in embryo.

So Jason was dead; and his brothers Polydorus and Polyphron were appointed princes (29) in
his place. But of these twain, as they journeyed together to Larissa, Polydorus was slain in
the night, as he slept, by his brother Polyphron, it was thought; since a death so sudden,
without obvious cause, could hardly be otherwise accounted for.

 (29) Lit. "Tagoi."

Polyphron governed for a year, and by the year's end he had refashioned his princedom into
the likeness of a tyranny. In Pharsalus he put to death Polydamas (30) and eight other of the
best citizens; and from Larissa he drove many into exile. But while he was thus employed, he,
in his turn, was done to death by Alexander, who slew him to avenge Polydorus and to destroy
the tyranny. This man now assumed the reins of office, and had no sooner done so than he showed
himself a harsh prince to the Thessalians: harsh too and hostile to the Thebans and Athenians,
(31) and an unprincipled freebooter everywhere by land and by sea. But if that was his character,
he too was doomed to perish shortly. The perpetrators of the deed were his wife's brothers.
(32) The counsellor of it and the inspiring soul was the wife herself. She it was who reported
to them that Alexander had designs against them; who hid them within the house a whole day;
who welcomed home her husband deep in his cups and laid him to rest, and then while the lamp
still burned brought out the prince's sword. It was she also who, perceiving her brothers shrank
bank, fearing to go in and attack Alexander, said to them, "If you do not be quick and do the
deed, I will wake him up!" After they had gone in, she, too, it was who caught and pulled to
the door, clinging fast to the knocker till the breath was out of her husband's body. (33)
Her fierce hatred against the man is variously explained. By some it was said to date from
the day when Alexander, having imprisoned his own favourite--who was a fair young stripling--when
his wife supplicated him to release the boy, brought him forth and stabbed him in the throat.
Others say it originated through his sending to Thebes and seeking the hand of the wife of
Jason in marriage, because his own wife bore him no children. These are the various causes
assigned to explain the treason of his wife against him. Of the brothers who executed it, the
eldest, Tisiphonus, in virtue of his seniority accepted, and up to the date of this history
(34) succeeded in holding, the government.

The above is a sketch of Thessalian affairs, including the incidents connected with Jason,
and those subsequent to his death, down to the government of Tisiphonus. I now return to the
point at which we digressed.

B.C. 371. Archidamus, after the relief of the army defeated at Leuctra, had led back the united
forces. When he was gone, the Athenians, impressed by the fact that the Peloponessians still
felt under an obligation to follow the Lacedaemonians to the field, whilst Sparta herself was
by no means as yet reduced to a condition resembling that to which she had reduced Athens,
sent invitations to those states which cared to participate in the peace authorised by the
great king. (1) A congress met, and they passed a resolution in conjunction with those who
wished to make common cause with them to bind themselves by oath as follows: "I will abide
by the treaty terms as conveyed in the king's rescript, as also by the decrees of the Athenians
and the allies. If any one marches against any city among those which have accepted this oath,
I will render assistance to that city with all my strength." The oath gave general satisfaction,
the Eleians alone gainsaying its terms and protesting that it was not right to make either
the Marganians or the Scilluntians or the Triphylians independent, since these cities belonged
to them, and were a part of Elis. (2) The Athenians, however, and the others passed the decree
in the precise language of the king's rescript: that all states--great and small alike--were
to be independent; and they sent out administrators of the oath, and enjoined upon them to
administer it to the highest authorities in each state. This oath they all, with the exception
of the Eleians, swore to.

 (1) I.e. in B.C. 387, the peace "of" Antalcidas. See Grote, "H. G." x.
    274.

 (2) See Busolt, op. cit. p. 186.

B.C. 371-370. As an immediate consequence of this agreement, the Mantineans, on the assumption
that they were now absolutely independent, met in a body and passed a decree to make Mantinea
into a single state and to fortify the town. (3) The proceeding was not overlooked by the Lacedaemonians,
who thought it would be hard if this were done without their consent. Accordingly they despatched
Agesilaus as ambassador to the Mantineans, choosing him as the recognised ancestral friend
of that people. When the ambassador arrived, however, the chief magistrates had no inclination
to summon a meeting of the commons to listen to him, but urged him to make a statement of his
wishes to themselves. He, on his side, was ready to undertake for himself and in their interests
that, if they would at present desist from their fortification work, he would bring it about
that the defensive walls should be built with the sanction of Lacedaemon and without cost.
Their answer was, that it was impossible to hold back, since a decree had been passed by the
whole state of Mantinea to build at once. Whereupon Agesilaus went off in high dudgeon; though
as to sending troops to stop them, (4) the idea seemed impracticable, as the peace was based
upon the principle of autonomy. Meanwhile the Mantineans received help from several of the
Arcadian states in the building of their walls; and the Eleians contributed actually three
talents (5) of silver to cover the expense of their construction. And here leaving the Mantineans
thus engaged, we will turn to the men of Tegea.

 (3) For the restoration of Mantinea, see Freeman, "Fed. Gov." iv. p.
    198; Grote, "H. G." x. 283 foll.

 (4) See above, V. ii. 1, sub anno B.C. 386.

 (5) = 731 pounds: 5 shillings. See Busolt, op. cit. p. 199.

There were in Tegea two political parties. The one was the party of Callibius and Proxenus,
who were for drawing together the whole Arcadian population in a confederacy, (6) in which
all measures carried in the common assembly should be held valid for the individual component
states. The programme of the other (Stasippus's) party was to leave Tegea undisturbed and in
the enjoyment of the old national laws. Perpetually defeated in the Sacred College, (7) the
party of Callibius and Proxenus were persuaded that if only the commons met they would gain
an easy victory by an appeal to the multitude; and in this faith they proceeded to march out
the citizen soldiers. (8) At sight of this Stasippus and his friends on their side armed in
opposition, and proved not inferior in numbers. The result was a collision and battle, in which
Proxenus and some few others with him were slain and the rest put to flight; though the conquerors
did not pursue, for Stasippus was a man who did not care to stain his hands with the blood
of his fellow-citizens. (9)

 (6) Although the historian does not recount the foundation of
    Megalopolis (see Pausanias and Diodorus), the mention of the
    common assembly of the League {en to koino} in this passage and,
    still more, of the Ten Thousand (below, "Hell." VII. i. 38),
    implies it. See Freeman, op. cit. iv. 197 foll.; Grote, "H. G." x.
    306 foll., ii. 599; "Dict. of Geog." "Megalopolis." As to the date
    of its foundation Pausanias (VIII. xxvii. 8) says "a few months
    after the battle of Leuctra," before midsummer B.C. 370; Diodorus
    (xv. 72) says B.C. 368. The great city was not built in a day.
    Messene, according to Paus. IV. xxvii. 5, was founded between the
    midsummers of B.C. 370 and B.C. 369.

 (7) Lit. "in the Thearoi." For the Theari, see Thuc. v. 47, Arnold's
    note; and "C. I. G." 1756 foll.; and for the revolution at Tegea

 (8) Or, "they mustered under arms."

 (9) Or, "opposed to a wholesale slaughter of the citizens."

Callibius and his friends had retired under the fortification walls and gates facing Mantinea;
but, as their opponents made no further attempts against them, they here collected together
and remained quiet. Some while ago they had sent messages to the Mantineans demanding assistance,
but now they were ready to discuss terms of reconciliation with the party of Stasippus. Presently
they saw the Mantineans advancing; whereupon some of them sprang to the walls, and began calling
to them to bring succour with all speed. With shouts they urged upon them to make haste, whilst
others threw open wide the gates to them. Stasippus and his party, perceiving what was happening,
poured out by the gates leading to Pallantium, (10) and, outspeeding their pursuers, succeeded
in reaching the temple of Artemis, where they found shelter, and, shutting to the doors, kept
quiet. Following close upon their heels, however, their foes scaled the temple, tore off the
roof, and began striking them down with the tiles. They, recognising that there was no choice,
called upon their assailants to desist, and undertook to come forth. Then their opponents,
capturing them like birds in a fowler's hand, bound them with chains, threw them on to the
prisoner's van, (11) and led them off to Tegea. Here with the Mantineans they sentenced and
put them to death.

 (10) Pallantium, one of the most ancient towns of Arcadia, in the
    Maenalia (Paus. VIII. xliv. 5; Livy, i. 5), situated somewhat
    south of the modern Tripolitza (see "Dict. of Anc. Geog."); like
    Asea and Eutaea it helped to found Megalopolis (Paus. VIII. xxvii.
    3, where for {'Iasaia} read {'Asea}); below, VII. v. 5; Busolt,
    op. cit. p. 125.

 (11) For the sequel of the matter, see above, "Hell." VI. iv. 18;
    Busolt, op. cit. p. 134.

The outcome of these proceedings was the banishment to Lacedaemon of the Tegeans who formed
the party of Stasippus, numbering eight hundred; but as a sequel to what had taken place, the
Lacedaemonians determined that they were bound by their oaths to aid the banished Tegeans and
to avenge the slain. With this purpose they marched against the Mantineans, on the ground that
they had violated their oaths in marching against Tegea with an armed force. The ephors called
out the ban and the state commanded Agesilaus to head the expedition.

Meanwhile most of the Arcadian contingents were mustering at Asea. (12) The Orchomenians not
only refused to take part in the Arcadian league, on account of their personal hatred to Mantinea,
but had actually welcomed within their city a mercenary force under Polytropus, which had been
collected at Corinth. The Mantineans themselves were forced to stay at home to keep an eye
on these. The men of Heraea and Lepreum made common cause with the Lacedaemonians in a campaign
against Mantinea.

 (12) Asea is placed by Leake ("Travels in Morea," i. 84; iii. 34) near
    Frangovrysi, a little south of Pallantium.

    Elis, on the high road to Olympia, and commanding other main
    roads. See Leake, "Peloponnesiaca," p. 1 foll.; "Morea," ii. 91.

    Lepreum, chief town of the Triphylia (Herod. iv. 148, ix. 28;
    Thuc. v. 31; above, III. ii. 25; Paus. V. v. 3; Polyb. iv. 77
    foll.; Strab. viii. 345), near modern Strovitzi; Leake, "Morea,"
    i. 56; Dodwell, "Tour," ii. 347.

    Eutaea is placed by Leake between Asea and Pallantium at Barbitza
    ("Morea," iii. 31); but see Grote, "H. G." x. 288.

Finding the frontier sacrifices favourable, Agesilaus began his march at once upon Arcadia.
He began by occupying the border city of Eutaea, where he found the old men, women, and children
dwelling in their houses, while the rest of the population of a military age were off to join
the Arcadian league. In spite of this he did not stir a finger unjustly against the city, but
suffered the inhabitants to continue in their homes undisturbed. The troops took all they needed,
and paid for it in return; if any pillage had occurred on his first entrance into the town,
the property was hunted up and restored by the Spartan king. Whilst awaiting the arrival of
Polytropus's mercenaries, he amused himself by repairing such portions of their walls as necessity
demanded.

Meanwhile the Mantineans had taken the field against Orchomenus; but from the walls of that
city the invaders had some difficulty in retiring, and lost some of their men. On their retreat
they found themselves in Elymia; (13) here the heavy infantry of the Orchomenians ceased to
follow them; but Polytropus and his troops continued to assail their rear with much audacity.
At this conjuncture, seeing at a glance that either they must beat back the foe or suffer their
own men to be shot down, the Mantineans turned right about and met the assailant in a hand-to-hand
encounter. Polytropus fell fighting on that battlefield; and of the rest who took to flight,
many would have shared his fate, but for the opportune arrival of the Phliasian cavalry, who
swooped round to the conqueror's rear and checked him in his pursuit. (14)

 (13) Elymia, mentioned only by Xenophon, must have been on the
    confines of the Mantinice and Orchomenus, probably at Levidhi.--
    Leake, "Morea," iii. 75; "Peloponn." p. 229.

 (14) See "Cyrop." VII. i. 36.

Content with this achievement, the Mantineans retired homewards; while Agesilaus, to whom the
news was brought, no longer expecting that the Orchomenian mercenaries could effect a junction
with himself, determined to advance without further delay. (15) On the first day he encamped
for the evening meal in the open country of Tegea, and the day following crossed into Mantinean
territory. Here he encamped under the westward-facing (16) mountains of Mantinea, and employed
himself in ravaging the country district and sacking the farmsteads; while the troops of the
Arcadians who were mustered in Asea stole by night into Tegea. The next day Agesilaus shifted
his position, encamping about two miles' (17) distance from Mantinea; and the Arcadians, issuing
from Tegea and clinging to the mountains between Mantinea and that city, appeared with large
bodies of heavy infantry, wishing to effect a junction with the Mantineans. The Argives, it
is true, supported them, but they were not in full force. And here counsellors were to be found
who urged on Agesilaus to attack these troops separately; but fearing lest, in proportion as
he pressed on to engage them, the Mantineans might issue from the city behind and attack him
on flank and rear, he decided it was best to let the two bodies coalesce, and then, if they
would accept battle, to engage them on an open and fair field.

 (15) See "Ages." ii. 23.

 (16) See Leake, "Morea," iii. 73.

 (17) Lit. "twenty stades."

And so ere long the Arcadians had effected their object and were united with the Mantineans.
The next incident was the sudden apparition at break of day, as Agesilaus was sacrificing in
front of the camp, of a body of troops. These proved to be the light infantry from Orchomenus,
who in company with the Phliasian cavalry had during the night made their way across past the
town of Mantinea; and so caused the mass of the army to rush to their ranks, and Agesilaus
himself to retire within the lines. Presently, however, the newcomers were recognised as friends;
and as the sacrifices were favourable, Agesilaus led his army forward a stage farther after
breakfast. As the shades of evening descended he encamped unobserved within the fold of the
hills behind the Mantinean territory, with mountains in close proximity all round. (18)

 (18) Lit. "within the hindmost bosom of the Mantinice." In reference
    to the position, Leake ("Morea," iii. 75) says: "The northern bay
     (of the Mantinic plain between Mantinea and the Argon) corresponds
    better by its proximity to Mantinea; by Mount Alesium it was
    equally hidden from the city, while its small dimensions, and the
    nearness of the incumbent mountains, rendered it a more hazardous
    position to an army under the circumstances of that of Agesilaus"
     (than had he encamped in the Argon itself). For the Argon (or
    Inert Plain), see Leake, ib. 54 foll.

On the next morning, as day broke, he sacrificed in front of the army; and observing a mustering
of men from the city of Mantinea on the hills which overhung the rear of his army, he decided
that he must lead his troops out of the hollow by the quickest route. But he feared lest, if
he himself led off, the enemy might fall upon his rear. In this dilemma he kept quiet; presenting
a hostile front to the enemy, he sent orders to his rear to face about to the right, (19) and
so getting into line behind his main body, to move forward upon him; and in this way he at
once extricated his troops from their cramped position and kept continually adding to the weight
and solidity of his line. As soon as the phalanx was doubled in depth he emerged upon the level
ground, with his heavy infantry battalions in this order, and then again extended his line
until his troops were once more nine or ten shields deep. But the Mantineans were no longer
so ready to come out. The arguments of the Eleians who had lent them their co-operation had
prevailed: that it was better not to engage until the arrival of the Thebans. The Thebans,
it was certain, would soon be with them; for had they not borrowed ten talents (20) from Elis
in order to be able to send aid? The Arcadians with this information before them kept quiet
inside Mantinea. On his side Agesilaus was anxious to lead off his troops, seeing it was midwinter;
but, to avoid seeming to hurry his departure out of fear, he preferred to remain three days
longer and no great distance from Mantinea. On the fourth day, after an early morning meal,
the retreat commenced. His intention was to encamp on the same ground which he had made his
starting-point on leaving Eutaea. But as none of the Arcadians appeared, he marched with all
speed and reached Eutaea itself, although very late, that day; being anxious to lead off his
troops without catching a glimpse of the enemy's watch-fires, so as to silence the tongues
of any one pretending that he withdrew in flight. His main object was in fact achieved. To
some extent he had recovered the state from its late despondency, since he had invaded Arcadia
and ravaged the country without any one caring to offer him battle. But, once arrived on Laconian
soil, he dismissed the Spartan troops to their homes and disbanded the provincials (21) to
their several cities.

 (20) 2,437 pounds: 10 shillings. See Busult, op. cit. p. 199.

 (21) Lit. "perioeci"; and below, SS. 25, 32.

B.C. 370-369. The Arcadians, now that Agesilaus had retired, realising that he had disbanded
his troops, while they themselves were fully mustered, marched upon Heraea, the citizens of
which town had not only refused to join the Arcadian league, but had joined the Lacedaemonians
in their invasion of Arcadia. For this reason they entered the country, burning the homesteads
and cutting down the fruit-trees.

Meanwhile news came of the arrival of the Theban reinforcements at Mantinea, on the strength
of which they left Heraea and hastened to fraternise (22) with their Theban friends. When they
were met together, the Thebans, on their side, were well content with the posture of affairs:
they had duly brought their succour, and no enemy was any longer to be discovered in the country;
so they made preparations to return home. But the Arcadians, Argives and Eleians were eager
in urging them to lead the united forces forthwith into Laconia: they dwelt proudly on their
own numbers, extolling above measure the armament of Thebes. And, indeed, the Boeotians one
and all were resolute in their military manouvres and devotion to arms, (23) exulting in the
victory of Leuctra. In the wake of Thebes followed the Phocians, who were now their subjects,
Euboeans from all the townships of the island, both sections of the Locrians, the Acarnanians,
(24) and the men of Heraclea and of Melis; while their force was further swelled by Thessalian
cavalry and light infantry. With the full consciousness of facts like these, and further justifying
their appeal by dwelling on the desolate condition of Lacedaemon, deserted by her troops, they
entreated them not to turn back without invading the territory of Laconia. But the Thebans,
albeit they listened to their prayers, urged arguments on the other side. In the first place,
Laconia was by all accounts most difficult to invade; and their belief was that garrisons were
posted at all the points most easily approached. (As a matter of fact, Ischolaus was posted
at Oeum in the Sciritid, with a garrison of neodamodes and about four hundred of the youngest
of the Tegean exiles; and there was a second outpost on Leuctrum above the Maleatid. (25))
Again it occurred to the Thebans that the Lacedaemonian forces, though disbanded, would not
take long to muster, and once collected they would fight nowhere better than on their own native
soil. Putting all these considerations together, they were not by any means impatient to march
upon Lacedaemon. A strong counter-impulse, however, was presently given by the arrival of messengers
from Caryae, giving positive information as to the defenceless condition of the country, and
offering to act as guides themselves; they were ready to lose their lives if they were convicted
of perfidy. A further impulse in the same direction was given by the presence of some of the
provincials, (26) with invitations and promises of revolt, if only they would appear in the
country. These people further stated that even at the present moment, on a summons of the Spartans
proper, the provincials did not care to render them assistance. With all these arguments and
persuasions echoing from all sides, the Thebans at last yielded, and invaded. They chose the
Caryan route themselves, while the Arcadians entered by Oeum in the Sciritid. (27)

 (22) Or, "effect a junction with."

 (23) Or, "in practising gymnastics about the place of arms." See "Pol.
    Lac." xii. 5.

 (24) See "Hell." IV. vii. 1; "Ages." ii. 20. For a sketch of the
    relations of Acarnania to Athens and Sparta, see Hicks, No. 83, p.
    150; and above, "Hell." V. iv. 64.

 (25) Leuctrum, a fortress of the district Aegytis on the confines of
    Arcadia and Laconia ("in the direction of Mount Lycaeum," Thuc. v.
    54). See Leake, "Morea," ii. 322; also "Peloponn." p. 248, in
    which place he corrects his former view as to the situation of
    Leuctrum and the Maleatid.

    Oeum or Ium, the chief town of the Sciritis, probably stood in the
    Klisura or series of narrow passes through the watershed of the
    mountains forming the natural boundary between Laconia and Arcadia
    (in the direct line north from Sparta to Tegea), "Dict. of Anc.
    Geog." s.v. Leake says ("Morea," iii. 19, 30 foll.) near the
    modern village of Kolina; Baedeker ("Greece," p. 269) says perhaps
    at Palaeogoulas.

    Caryae. This frontier town was apparently (near Arachova) on the
    road from Thyrea (in the direction of the Argolid) to Sparta
    (Thuc. v. 55; Paus. III. x. 7; Livy, xxxiv. 26, but see Leake,
    "Morea," iii. 30; "Peloponn." p. 342).

    Sellasia, probably rightly placed "half an hour above Vourlia"
    (Baedeker, "Greece," p. 269). The famous battle of Sellasia, in
    the spring of B.C. 221, in which the united Macedonians under
    Antigonus and the Achaeans finally broke the power of Sparta, was
    fought in the little valley where the stream Gorgylus joins the
    river Oenus and the Khan of Krevatas now stands. For a plan, see
    "Dict. of Anc. Geog." s.v.

 (26) "Perioeci."

 (27) Diodorus (xv. 64) gives more details; he makes the invaders
    converge upon Sellasia by four separate routes. See Leake,
    "Morea," iii. 29 foll.

By all accounts Ischolaus made a mistake in not advancing to meet them on the difficult ground
above Oeum. Had he done so, not a man, it is believed, would have scaled the passes there.
But for the present, wishing to turn the help of the men of Oeum to good account, he waited
down in the village; and so the invading Arcadians scaled the heights in a body. At this crisis
Ischolaus and his men, as long as they fought face to face with their foes, held the superiority;
but, presently, when the enemy, from rear and flank, and even from the dwelling-houses up which
they scaled, rained blows and missiles upon them, then and there Ischolaus met his end, and
every man besides, save only one or two who, failing to be recognised, effected their escape.

After these achievements the Arcadians marched to join the Thebans at Caryae, and the Thebans,
hearing what wonders the Arcadians had performed, commenced their descent with far greater
confidence. Their first exploit was to burn and ravage the district of Sellasia, but finding
themselves ere long in the flat land within the sacred enclosure of Apollo, they encamped for
the night, and the next day continued their march along the Eurotas. When they came to the
bridge they made no attempt to cross it to attack the city, for they caught sight of the heavy
infantry in the temple of Alea (28) ready to meet them. So, keeping the Eurotas on their right,
they tramped along, burning and pillaging homesteads stocked with numerous stores. The feelings
of the citizens may well be imagined. The women who had never set eyes upon a foe (29) could
scarcely contain themselves as they beheld the cloud of smoke. The Spartan warriors, inhabiting
a city without fortifications, posted at intervals, here one and there another, were in truth
what they appeared to be--the veriest handful. And these kept watch and ward. The authorities
passed a resolution to announce to the helots that whosoever among them chose to take arms
and join a regiment should have his freedom guaranteed to him by solemn pledges in return for
assistance in the common war. (30) More than six thousand helots, it is said, enrolled themselves,
so that a new terror was excited by the very incorporation of these men, whose numbers seemed
to be excessive. But when it was found that the mercenaries from Orchomenus remained faithful,
and reinforcements came to Lacedaemon from Phlius, Corinth, Epidaurus, and Pellene, and some
other states, the dread of these new levies was speedily diminished.

 (28) See Pausanias, III. xix. 7.

 (29) See Plutarch, "Ages." xxxi. 3 (Clough, vol. iv. p. 38); Aristot.
    "Pol." ii. 9-10.

 (30) See below, VII. ii. 2.

The enemy in his advance came to Amyclae. (31) Here he crossed the Eurotas. The Thebans wherever
they encamped at once formed a stockade of the fruit-trees they had felled, as thickly piled
as possible, and so kept ever on their guard. The Arcadians did nothing of the sort. They left
their camping-ground and took themselves off to attack the homesteads and loot. On the third
or fourth day after their arrival the cavalry advanced, squadron by squadron, as far as the
racecourse, (32) within the sacred enclosure of Gaiaochos. These consisted of the entire Theban
cavalry and the Eleians, with as many of the Phocian or Thessalian or Locrian cavalry as were
present. The cavalry of the Lacedaemonians, looking a mere handful, were drawn up to meet them.
They had posted an ambuscade chosen from their heavy infantry, the younger men, about three
hundred in number, in the house of the Tyndarids (33); and while the cavalry charged, out rushed
the three hundred at the same instant at full pace. The enemy did not wait to receive the double
charge, but swerved, and at sight of that many also of the infantry took to headlong flight.
But the pursuers presently paused; the Theban army remained motionless; and both parties returned
to their camps. And now the hope, the confidence strengthened that an attack upon the city
itself would never come; nor did it. The invading army broke up from their ground, and marched
off on the road to Helos and Gytheum. (34) The unwalled cities were consigned to the flames,
but Gytheum, where the Lacedaemonians had their naval arsenal, was subjected to assault for
three days. Certain of the provincials (35) also joined in this attack, and shared the campaign
with the Thebans and their friends.

 (31) For this ancient (Achaean) town, see Paus. III. ii. 6; Polyb. v.
    19. It lay only twenty stades (a little more than two miles) from
    the city of Sparta.

 (32) Or, "hippodrome." See Paus. III. ii. 6.

 (34) See Baedeker's "Greece," p. 279. Was Gytheum taken? See Grote,

 (35) "Perioeci." See above, III. iii. 6; VI. v. 25; below, VII. ii. 2;
    Grote, "H. G." x. 301. It is a pity that the historian should
    hurry us off to Athens just at this point. The style here is
    suggestive of notes ({upomnemata}) unexpanded.

The news of these proceedings set the Athenians deeply pondering what they ought to do concerning
the Lacedaemonians, and they held an assembly in accordance with a resolution of the senate.
It chanced that the ambassadors of the Lacedaemonians and the allies still faithful to Lacedaemon
were present. The Lacedaemonian ambassadors were Aracus, Ocyllus, Pharax, Etymocles, and Olontheus,
and from the nature of the case they all used, roughly speaking, similar arguments. They reminded
the Athenians how they had often in old days stood happily together, shoulder to shoulder,
in more than one great crisis. They (the Lacedaemonians), on their side, had helped to expel
the tyrant from Athens, and the Athenians, when Lacedaemon was besieged by the Messenians,
had heartily leant her a helping hand. (36) Then they fell to enumerating all the blessings
that marked the season when the two states shared a common policy, hinting how in common they
had warred against the barbarians, and more boldly recalling how the Athenians with the full
consent and advice of the Lacedaemonians were chosen by united Hellas leaders of the common
navy (37) and guardians of all the common treasure, while they themselves were selected by
all the Hellenes as confessedly the rightful leaders on land; and this also not without the
full consent and concurrence of the Athenians.

 (36) In reference (1) to the expulsion of the Peisistratidae (Herod.
    v. 64); (2) the "third" Messenian war (Thuc. i. 102).

 (37) See "Revenues," v. 6.

One of the speakers ventured on a remark somewhat to this strain: "If you and we, sirs, can
only agree, there is hope to-day that the old saying may be fulfilled, and Thebes be 'taken
and tithed.'" (38) The Athenians, however, were not in the humour to listen to that style of
argument. A sort of suppressed murmur ran through the assembly which seemed to say, "That language
may be well enough now; but when they were well off they pressed hard enough on us." But of
all the pleas put forward by the Lacedaemonians, the weightiest appeared to be this: that when
they had reduced the Athenians by war, and the Thebans wished to wipe Athens off the face of
the earth, they (the Lacedaemonians) themselves had opposed the measure. (39) If that was the
argument of most weight, the reasoning which was the most commonly urged was to the effect
that "the solemn oaths necessitated the aid demanded. Sparta had done no wrong to justify this
invasion on the part of the Arcadians and their allies. All she had done was to assist the
men of Tegea when (40) the Mantineans had marched against that township contrary to their solemn
oaths." Again, for the second time, at these expressions a confused din ran through the assembly,
half the audience maintaining that the Mantineans were justified in supporting Proxenus and
his friends, who were put to death by the party with Stasippus; the other half that they were
wrong in bringing an armed force against the men of Tegea.

 (38) Or, "the Thebans be decimated"; for the phrase see above, "Hell."
    VI. iii. 20.

 (39) See "Hell." II. ii. 19; and "Hell." III. v. 8.

 (40) Lit. "because," {oti}.

Whilst these distinctions were being drawn by the assembly itself, Cleiteles the Corinthian
got up and spoke as follows: "I daresay, men of Athens, there is a double answer to the question,
Who began the wrongdoing? But take the case of ourselves. Since peace began, no one can accuse
us either of wantonly attacking any city, or of seizing the wealth of any, or of ravaging a
foreign territory. In spite of which the Thebans have come into our country and cut down our
fruit-trees, burnt to the ground our houses, filched and torn to pieces our cattle and our
goods. How then, I put it to you, will you not be acting contrary to your solemn oaths if you
refuse your aid to us, who are so manifestly the victims of wrongdoings? Yes; and when I say
solemn oaths, I speak of oaths and undertakings which you yourselves took great pains to exact
from all of us." At that point a murmur of applause greeted Cleiteles, the Athenians feeling
the truth and justice of the speaker's language.

He sat down, and then Procles of Phlius got up and spoke as follows: "What would happen, men
of Athens, if the Lacedaemonians were well out of the way? The answer to that question is obvious.
You would be the first object of Theban invasion. Clearly; for they must feel that you and
you alone stand in the path between them and empire over Hellas. If this be so, I do not consider
that you are more supporting Lacedaemon by a campaign in her behalf than you are helping yourselves.
For imagine the Thebans, your own sworn foes and next-door neighbours, masters of Hellas! You
will find it a painful and onerous exchange indeed for the distant antagonism of Sparta. As
a mere matter of self-interest, now is the time to help yourselves, while you may still reckon
upon allies, instead of waiting until they are lost, and you are forced to fight a life-and-death
battle with the Thebans single-handed. But the fear suggests itself, that should the Lacedaemonians
escape now, they will live to cause you trouble at some future date. Lay this maxim to heart,
then, that it is not the potential greatness of those we benefit, but of those we injure, which
causes apprehension. And this other also, that it behoves individuals and states alike so to
better their position (41) while yet in the zenith of their strength that, in the day of weakness,
when it comes, they may find some succour and support in what their former labours have achieved.
(42) To you now, at this time, a heaven-sent opportunity is presented. In return for assistance
to the Lacedaemonians in their need, you may win their sincere, unhesitating friendship for
all time. Yes, I say it deliberately, for the acceptance of these benefits at your hands will
not be in the presence of one or two chance witnesses. The all-seeing gods, in whose sight
to-morrow is even as to-day, will be cognisant of these things. The knowledge of them will
be jointly attested by allies and enemies; nay, by Hellenes and barbarians alike, since to
not one of them is what we are doing a matter of unconcern. If, then, in the presence of these
witnesses, the Lacedaemonians should prove base towards you, no one will ever again be eager
in their cause. But our hope, our expectation should rather be that they will prove themselves
good men and not base; since they beyond all others would seem persistently to have cherished
a high endeavour, reaching forth after true praise, and holding aloof from ugly deeds.

 (41) Lit. "to acquire some good."

 (42) Or, "for what," etc.

"But there are further considerations which it were well you should lay to heart. If danger
were ever again to visit Hellas from the barbarian world outside, in whom would you place your
confidence if not in the Lacedaemonians? Whom would you choose to stand at your right hand
in battle if not these, whose soldiers at Thermopylae to a man preferred to fall at their posts
rather than save their lives by giving the barbarian free passage into Hellas? Is it not right,
then, considering for what thing's sake they displayed that bravery in your companionship,
considering also the good hope there is that they will prove the like again--is it not just
that you and we should lend them all countenance and goodwill? Nay, even for us their allies'
sake, who are present, it would be worth your while to manifest this goodwill. Need you be
assured that precisely those who continue faithful to them in their misfortunes would in like
manner be ashamed not to requite you with gratitude? And if we seem to be but small states,
who are willing to share their dangers with them, lay to heart that there is a speedy cure
for this defect: with the accession of your city the reproach that, in spite of all our assistance,
we are but small cities, will cease to be.

"For my part, men of Athens, I have hitherto on hearsay admired and envied this great state,
whither, I was told, every one who was wronged or stood in terror of aught needed only to betake
himself and he would obtain assistance. To-day I no longer hear, I am present myself and see
these famous citizens of Lacedaemon here, and by their side their trustiest friends, who have
come to you, and ask you in their day of need to give them help. I see Thebans also, the same
who in days bygone failed to persuade the Lacedaemonians to reduce you to absolute slavery,
(43) to-day asking you to suffer those who saved you to be destroyed.

 (43) See "Hell." II. ii. 19; III. v. 8, in reference to B.C. 405.

"That was a great deed and of fair renown, attributed in old story to your ancestors, that
they did not suffer those Argives who died on the Cadmeia (44) to lie unburied; but a fairer
wreath of glory would you weave for your own brows if you suffer not these still living Lacedaemonians
to be trampled under the heel of insolence and destroyed. Fair, also, was that achievement
when you stayed the insolence of Eurystheus and saved the sons of Heracles; (45) but fairer
still than that will your deed be if you rescue from destruction, not the primal authors (46)
merely, but the whole city which they founded; fairest of all, if because yesterday the Lacedaemonians
won you your preservation by a vote which cost them nothing, you to-day shall bring them help
with arms, and at the price of peril. It is a proud day for some of us to stand here and give
what aid we can in pleading for assistance to brave men. What, then, must you feel, who in
very deed are able to render that assistance! How generous on your parts, who have been so
often the friends and foes of Lacedaemon, to forget the injury and remember only the good they
have done! How noble of you to repay, not for yourselves only, but for the sake of Hellas,
the debt due to those who proved themselves good men and true in her behalf!"

 (44) In reference to the Seven against Thebes, see Herod. IX. xxvii.
    4; Isoc. "Paneg." 55.

 (45) Herod. IX. xxvii. 3; see Isoc. "Paneg." 56. "The greatness of
    Sparta was founded by the succour which Athens lent to the
    Heraklid invaders of the Peloponnese--a recollection which ought
    to restrain Sparta from injuring or claiming to rule Athens.
    Argos, Thebes, Sparta were in early times, as they are now, the
    foremost cities of Hellas; but Athens was the greatest of them all
    --the avenger of Argos, the chastiser of Thebes, the patron of
    those who founded Sparta."--Jebb, "Att. Or." ii. 154.

 (46) Plut. "Lyc." vi.

After these speeches the Athenians deliberated, and though there was opposition, the arguments
of gainsayers (47) fell upon deaf ears. The assembly finally passed a decree to send assistance
to Lacedaemon in force, and they chose Iphicrates general. Then followed the preliminary sacrifices,
and then the general's order to his troops to take the evening meal in the grove of the Academy.
(48) But the general himself, it is said, was in no hurry to leave the city; many were found
at their posts before him. Presently, however, he put himself at the head of his troops, and
the men followed cheerily, in firm persuasion that he was about to lead them to some noble
exploit. On arrival at Corinth he frittered away some days, and there was a momentary outburst
of discontent at so much waste of precious time; but as soon as he led the troops out of Corinth
there was an obvious rebound. The men responded to all orders with enthusiasm, heartily following
their general's lead, and attacking whatever fortified place he might confront them with.

 (47) As to the anti-Laconian or Boeotian party at Athens, see Curtius,
    "H. G." vol. v. ch. ii. (Eng. tr.)

 (48) See Baedeker, "Greece," p. 103.

And now reverting to the hostile forces on Laconian territory, we find that the Arcadians,
Argives, and Eleians had retired in large numbers. They had every inducement so to do since
their homes bordered on Laconia; and off they went, driving or carrying whatever they had looted.
The Thebans and the rest were no less anxious to get out of the country, though for other reasons,
partly because the army was melting away under their eyes day by day, partly because the necessities
of life were growing daily scantier, so much had been either fairly eaten up and pillaged or
else recklessly squandered and reduced to ashes. Besides this, it was winter; so that on every
ground there was a general desire by this time to get away home.

As son as the enemy began his retreat from Laconian soil, Iphicrates imitated his movement,
and began leading back his troops out of Arcadia into Corinthia. Iphicrates exhibited much
good generalship, no doubt, with which I have no sort of fault to find. But it is not so with
that final feature of the campaign to which we are now come. Here I find his strategy either
meaningless in intent or inadequate in execution. He made an attempt to keep guard at Oneion,
in order to prevent the Boeotians making their way out homewards; but left meanwhile far the
best passage through Cenchreae unguarded. Again, when he wished to discover whether or not
the Thebans had passed Oneion, he sent out on a reconnaissance the whole of the Athenian and
Corinthian cavalry; whereas, for the object in view, the eyes of a small detachment would have
been as useful as a whole regiment; (49) and when it came to falling back, clearly the smaller
number had a better chance of hitting on a traversable road, and so effecting the desired movement
quietly. But the height of folly seems to have been reached when he threw into the path of
the enemy a large body of troops which were still too weak to cope with him. As a matter of
fact, this body of cavalry, owing to their very numbers, could not help covering a large space
of ground; and when it became necessary to retire, had to cling to a series of difficult positions
in succession, so that they lost not fewer than twenty horsemen. (50) It was thus the Thebans
effected their object and retired from Peloponnese.

BOOK VII

I

B.C. 369. In the following year (1) plenipotentiary ambassadors (2) from the Lacedaemonians
and their allies arrived at Athens to consider and take counsel in what way the alliance between
Athens and Lacedaemon might be best cemented. It was urged by many speakers, foreigners and
Athenians also, that the alliance ought to be based on the principle of absolute equality,
(3) "share and share alike," when Procles of Phlius put forward the following argument:

 (1) I.e. the official year from spring to spring. See Peter, "Chron.
    Table" 95, note 215; see Grote, "H. G." x. 346, note 1.

 (2) See Hicks, 89.

 (3) For the phrase {epi toi isois kai omoiois}, implying "share and
    share alike," see Thuc. i. 145, etc.

"Since you have already decided, men of Athens, that it is good to secure the friendship of
Lacedaemon, the point, as it appears to me, which you ought now to consider is, by what means
this friendship may be made to last as long as possible. The probability is, that we shall
hold together best by making a treaty which shall suit the best interests of both parties.
On most points we have, I believe, a tolerable unanimity, but there remains the question of
leadership. The preliminary decree of your senate anticipates a division of the hegemony, crediting
you with the chief maritime power, Lacedaemon with the chief power on land; and to me, personally,
I confess, that seems a division not more established by human invention than preordained by
some divine naturalness or happy fortune. For, in the first place, you have a geographical
position pre-eminently adapted for naval supremacy; most of the states to whom the sea is important
are massed round your own, and all of these are inferior to you in strength. Besides, you have
harbours and roadsteads, without which it is not possible to turn a naval power to account.
Again, you have many ships of war. To extend your naval empire is a traditional policy; all
the arts and sciences connected with these matters you possess as home products, and, what
is more, in skill and experience of nautical affairs you are far ahead of the rest of the world.
The majority of you derive your livelihood from the sea, or things connected with it; so that
in the very act of minding your own affairs you are training yourselves to enter the lists
of naval combat. (4) Again, no other power in the world can send out a larger collective fleet,
and that is no insignificant point in reference to the question of leadership. The nucleus
of strength first gained becomes a rallying-point, round which the rest of the world will gladly
congregate. Furthermore, your good fortune in this department must be looked upon as a definite
gift of God: for, consider among the numberless great sea-fights which you have fought how
few you have lost, how many you have won. It is only rational, then, that your allies should
much prefer to share this particular risk with you. Indeed, to show you how natural and vital
to you is this maritime study, the following reflection may serve. For several years the Lacedaemonians,
when at war with you in old days, dominated your territory, but they made no progress towards
destroying you. At last God granted them one day to push forward their dominion on the sea,
and then in an instant you completely succumbed to them. (5) Is it not self-evident that your
safety altogether depends upon the sea? The sea is your natural element--your birthright; it
would be base indeed to entrust the hegemony of it to the Lacedaemonians, and the more so,
since, as they themselves admit, they are far less acquainted with this business than yourselves;
and, secondly, your risk in naval battles would not be for equal stakes--theirs involving only
the loss of the men on board their ships, but yours, that of your children and your wives and
the entire state.

 (4) See "Pol. Ath." i. 19 foll.

 (5) See "Hell." II. i.

"And if this is a fair statement of your position, turn, now, and consider that of the Lacedaemonians.
The first point to notice is, that they are an inland power; as long as they are dominant on
land it does not matter how much they are cut off from the sea--they can carry on existence
happily enough. This they so fully recognise, that from boyhood they devote themselves to training
for a soldier's life. The keystone of this training is obedience to command, (6) and in this
they hold the same pre-eminence on land which you hold on the sea. Just as you with your fleets,
so they on land can, at a moment's notice, put the largest army in the field; and with the
like consequence, that their allies, as is only rational, attach themselves to them with undying
courage. (7) Further, God has granted them to enjoy on land a like good fortune to that vouchsafed
to you on sea. Among all the many contests they have entered into, it is surprising in how
few they have failed, in how many they have been successful. The same unflagging attention
which you pay to maritime affairs is required from them on land, and, as the facts of history
reveal, it is no less indispensable to them. Thus, although you were at war with them for several
years and gained many a naval victory over them, you never advanced a step nearer to reducing
them. But once worsted on land, in an instant they were confronted with a danger affecting
the very lives of child and wife, and vital to the interests of the entire state. We may very
well understand, then, the strangeness, not to say monstrosity, in their eyes, of surrendering
to others the military leadership on land, in matters which they have made their special study
for so long and with such eminent success. I end where I began. I agree absolutely with the
preliminary decrees of your own senate, which I consider the solution most advantageous to
both parties. My prayer (8) is that you may be guided in your deliberations to that conclusion
which is best for each and all of us."

 (6) Or, "the spirit of discipline." See "Mem." III. v. 16; IV. iv. 15;
    Thuc. ii. 39; "Pol. Lac." viii.

 (7) Or, "with unlimited confidence."

 (8) See above, "Hell." VI. i. 13, {kai su prattois ta kratista}, "and
    so may the best fortune attend you!"--if that reading and
    rendering be adopted.

Such were the words of the orator, and the sentiments of his speech were vehemently applauded
by the Athenians no less than by the Lacedaemonians who were present. Then Cephisodotus (9)
stepped forward and addressed the assembly. He said, "Men of Athens, do you not see how you
are being deluded? Lend me your ears, and I will prove it to you in a moment. There is no doubt
about your leadership by sea: it is already secured. But suppose the Lacedaemonians in alliance
with you: it is plain they will send you admirals and captains, and possibly marines, of Laconian
breed; but who will the sailors be? Helots obviously, or mercenaries of some sort. These are
the folk over whom you will exercise your leadership. Reverse the case. The Lacedaemonians
have issued a general order summoning you to join them in the field; it is plain again, you
will be sending your heavy infantry and your cavalry. You see what follows. You have invented
a pretty machine, by which they become leaders of your very selves, and you become the leaders
either of their slaves or of the dregs of their state. I should like to put a question to the
Lacedaemonian Timocrates seated yonder. Did you not say just now, Sir, that you came to make
an alliance on terms of absolute equality, 'share and share alike'? Answer me." "I did say
so." "Well, then, here is a plan by which you get the perfection of equality. I cannot conceive
of anything more fair and impartial than that 'turn and turn about' each of us should command
the navy, each the army; whereby whatever advantage there may be in maritime or military command
we may each of us share."

 (9) See above, "Hell." VI. iii. 2; Hicks, 87.

These arguments were successful. The Athenians were converted, and passed a decree vesting
the command in either state (10) for periods of five days alternately.

 (10) See "Revenues," v. 7.

B.C. 369. (11) The campaign was commenced by both Athenians and Lacedaemonians with their allies,
marching upon Corinth, where it was resolved to keep watch and ward over Oneion jointly. On
the advance of the Thebans and their allies the troops were drawn out to defend the pass. They
were posted in detachments at different points, the most assailable of which was assigned to
the Lacedaemonians and the men of Pellene. (12)

 (11) See Grote, "H. G." x. 349 foll.; al. B.C. 368.

 (12) "During the wars of Epameinondas Pellene adhered firmly to her
    Spartan policy, at a time when other cities were, to say the
    least, less strenuous in the Spartan cause."--Freeman, "Hist. Fed.
    Gov." p. 241. Afterwards Pellene is found temporarily on the
    Theban side ("Hell." VII. ii. 11).

The Thebans and their allies, finding themselves within three or four miles (13) of the troops
guarding the pass, encamped in the flat ground below; but presently, after a careful calculation
of the time it would take to start and reach the goal in the gloaming, they advanced against
the Lacedaemonian outposts. In spite of the difficulty they timed their movements to a nicety,
and fell upon the Lacedaemonians and Pellenians just at the interval when the night pickets
were turning in and the men were leaving their shakedowns and retiring for necessary purposes.
(14) This was the instant for the Thebans to fling themselves upon them; they plied their weapons
with good effect, blow upon blow. Order was pitted against disorder, preparation against disarray.
When, however, those who escaped from the thick of the business had retired to the nearest
rising ground, the Lacedaemonian polemarch, who might have taken as many heavy, or light, infantry
of the allies as he wanted, and thus have held the position (no bad one, since it enabled him
to get his supplies safely enough from Cenchreae), failed to do so. On the contrary, and in
spite of the great perplexity of the Thebans as to how they were to get down from the high
level facing Sicyon or else retire the way they came, the Spartan general made a truce, which
in the opinion of the majority, seemed more in favour of the Thebans than himself, and so he
withdrew his division and fell back.

 (13) Lit. "thirty stades."

 (14) Or, "intent on their personal concerns." See "Hell." II. iv. 6;
    "Hipparch." vii. 12.

The Thebans were now free to descend without hindrance, which they did; and, effecting a junction
with their allies the Arcadians, Argives, and Eleians, at once attacked (15) Sicyon and Pellene,
and, marching on Epidaurus, laid waste the whole territory of that people. Returning from that
exploit with a consummate disdain for all their opponents, when they found themselves near
the city of Corinth they advanced at the double against the gate facing towards Phlius; intending
if they found it open to rush in. However, a body of light troops sallied out of the city to
the rescue, and met the advance of the Theban picked corps (16) not one hundred and fifty yards
(17) from the walls. Mounting on the monuments and commanding eminences, with volleys of sling
stones and arrows they laid low a pretty large number in the van of the attack, and routing
them, gave chase for three or four furlongs' (18) distance. After this incident the Corinthians
dragged the corpses of the slain to the wall, and finally gave them up under a flag of truce,
erecting a trophy to record the victory. As a result of this occurrence the allies of the Lacedaemonians
took fresh heart.

 (15) And took (apparently); see below; Diod. xv. 69.

 (16) See "Anab." III. iv. 43; and above, "Hell." V. iii. 23.

 (17) Lit. "four plethra."

 (18) LIt. "three or four stades."

At the date of the above transactions the Lacedeamonians were cheered by the arrival of a naval
reinforcement from Dionysius, consisting of more than twenty warships, which conveyed a body
of Celts and Iberians and about fifty cavalry. The day following, the Thebans and the rest
of the allies, posted, at intervals, in battle order, and completely filling the flat land
down to the sea on one side, and up to the knolls on the other which form the buttresses of
the city, proceeded to destroy everything precious they could lay their hands on in the plain.
The Athenian and Corinthian cavalry, eyeing the strength, physical and numerical, of their
antagonists, kept at a safe distance from their armament. But the little body of cavalry lately
arrived from Dionysius spread out in a long thin line, and one at one point and one at another
galloped along the front, discharging their missiles as they dashed forward, and when the enemy
rushed against them, retired, and again wheeling about, showered another volley. Even while
so engaged they would dismount from their horses and take breath; and if their foemen galloped
up while they were so dismounted, in an instant they had leapt on their horses' backs and were
in full retreat. Or if, again, a party pursued them some distance from the main body, as soon
as they turned to retire, they would press upon them, and discharging volleys of missiles,
made terrible work, forcing the whole army to advance and retire, merely to keep pace with
the movements of fifty horsemen.

B.C. 369-368. After this the Thebans remained only a few more days and then turned back homewards;
and the rest likewise to their several homes. Thereupon the troops sent by Dionysius attacked
Sicyon. Engaging the Sicyonians in the flat country, they defeated them, killing about seventy
men and capturing by assault the fortres of Derae. (19) After these achievements this first
reinforcement from Dionysius re-embarked and set sail for Syracuse.

 (19) "East of Sicyon was Epieiceia (see above, "Hell." IV. ii. 14, iv.
    13) on the river Nemea. In the same direction was the fortress
    Derae." ("Dict. Anct. Geog." "Topography of Sicyonia"), al. Gerae.
    So Leake ("Morea," iii. 376), who conjectures that this fortress
    was in the maritime plain.

Up to this time the Thebans and all the states which had revolted from Lacedaemon had acted
together in perfect harmony, and were content to campaign under the leadership of Thebes; but
now a certain Lycomedes, (20) a Mantinean, broke the spell. Inferior in birth and position
to none, while in wealth superior, he was for the rest a man of high ambition. This man was
able to inspire the Arcadians with high thoughts by reminding them that to Arcadians alone
the Peloponnese was in a literal sense a fatherland; since they and they alone were the indigenous
inhabitants of its sacred soil, and the Arcadian stock the largest among the Hellenic tribes--a
good stock, moreover, and of incomparable physique. And then he set himself to panegyrise them
as the bravest of the brave, adducing as evidence, if evidence were needed, the patent fact,
that every one in need of help invariably turned to the Arcadians. (21) Never in old days had
the Lacedaemonians yet invaded Athens without the Arcadians. "If then," he added, "you are
wise, you will be somewhat chary of following at the beck and call of anybody, or it will be
the old story again. As when you marched in the train of Sparta you only enhanced her power,
so to-day, if you follow Theban guidance without thought or purpose instead of claiming a division
of the headship, you will speedily find, perhaps, in her only a second edition of Lacedaemon." (22)

 (20) For the plan of an Arcadian Federation and the part played by
    Lycomedes, its true author, "who certainly merits thereby a high
    place among the statesmen of Greece," see Freeman, "Hist. Fed.
    Gov." ch. iv. p. 199 foll.

 (21) For this claim on the part of the Arcadians, see "Anab." VI. ii.
    10 foll.

 (22) Or, "Lacedaemonians under another name."

These words uttered in the ears of the Arcadians were sufficient to puff them up with pride.
They were lavish in their love of Lycomedes, and thought there was no one his equal. He became
their hero; he had only to give his orders, and they appointed their magistrates (23) at his
bidding. But, indeed, a series of brilliant exploits entitled the Arcadians to magnify themselves.
The first of these arose out of an invasion of Epidaurus by the Argives, which seemed likely
to end in their finding their escape barred by Chabrias and his foreign brigade with the Athenians
and Corinthians. Only, at the critical moment the Arcadians came to the rescue and extricated
the Argives, who were closely besieged, and this in spite not only of the enemy, but of the
savage nature of the ground itself. Again they marched on Asine (24) in Laconian territory,
and defeated the Lacedaemonian garrison, putting the polemarch Geranor, who was a Spartan,
to the sword, and sacking the suburbs of the town. Indeed, whenever or wherever they had a
mind to send an invading force, neither night nor wintry weather, nor length of road nor mountain
barrier could stay their march. So that at this date they regarded their prowess as invincible.
(25) The Thebans, it will be understood, could not but feel a touch of jealousy at these pretensions,
and their former friendship to the Arcadians lost its ardour. With the Eleians, indeed, matters
were worse. The revelation came to them when they demanded back from the Arcadians certain
cities (26) of which the Lacedaemonians had deprived them. They discovered that their views
were held of no account, but that the Triphylians and the rest who had revolted from them were
to be made much of, because they claimed to be Arcadians. (27) Hence, as contrasted with the
Thebans, the Eleians cherished feelings towards their late friends which were positively hostile.

B.C. 368. Self-esteem amounting to arrogance--such was the spirit which animated each section
of the allies, when a new phase was introduced by the arrival of Philiscus (28) of Abydos on
an embassy from Ariobarzanes (29) with large sums of money. This agent's first step was to
assemble a congress of Thebans, allies, and Lacedaemonians at Delphi to treat of peace. On
their arrival, without attempting to communicate or take counsel with the god as to how peace
might be re-established, they fell to deliberating unassisted; and when the Thebans refused
to acquiesce in the dependency of Messene (30) upon Lacedaemon, Philiscus set about collecting
a large foreign brigade to side with Lacedaemon and to prosecute the war.

 (29) See above, V. i. 28; "Ages." ii. 26.

 (30) See Hicks, 86.

Whilst these matters were still pending, the second reinforcements from Dionysius (31) arrived.
There was a difference of opinion as to where the troops should be employed, the Athenians
insisting that they ought to march into Thessaly to oppose the Thebans, the Lacedaemonians
being in favour of Laconia; and among the allies this latter opinion carried the day. The reinforcement
from Dionysius accordingly sailed round to Laconia, where Archidamus incorporated them with
the state troops and opened the campaign. Caryae he took by storm, and put every one captured
to the sword, and from this point marching straight upon the Parrhasians of Arcadia, he set
about ravaging the country along with his Syracusan supporters.

 (31) See above, SS. 20, 22, p. 191 foll. The date is B.C. 368
    according to Grote, "H. G." x. 362 foll.; al. B.C. 367.

Presently when the Arcadians and Argives arrived with succours, he retreated and encamped on
the knolls above Medea. (32) While he was there, Cissidas, the officer in charge of the reinforcement
from Dionysius, made the announcement that the period for his stay abroad had elapsed; and
the words were no sooner out of his lips than off he set on the road to Sparta. The march itself,
however, was not effected without delays, for he was met and cut off by a body of Messenians
at a narrow pass, and was forced in these straits to send to Archidamus and beg for assistance,
which the latter tendered. When they had got as far as the bend (33) on the road to Eutresia,
there were the Arcadians and Argives advancing upon Laconia and apparently intending, like
the Messenians, to shut the Spartan off from the homeward road.

 (32) Or, "Melea," or "Malea." E. Curtius conjectures {Meleas} for
    {Medeas} of the MSS., and probably the place referred to is the
    township of Malea in the Aegytis (Pausan. VIII. xxvii. 4); see
    above, "Hell." VI. v. 24, "the Maleatid." See Dind. "Hist. Gr.,"
    Ox. MDCCCLIII., note ad loc.; Curtius, "H. G." iv. 459; Grote, "H.
    G." x. 362.

 (33) Or, "the resting-place"; cf. mod. "Khan." L. and S. cf. Arist.
    "Frogs," 113. "Medea," below, is probably "Malea," (see last
    note).

Archidamus, debouching upon a flat space of ground where the roads to Eutresia and Medea converge,
drew up his troops and offered battle. When happened then is thus told:--He passed in front
of the regiments and addressed them in terms of encouragement thus: "Fellow-citizens, the day
has come which calls upon us to prove ourselves brave men and look the world in the face with
level eyes. (34) Now are we to deliver to those who come after us our fatherland intact as
we received it from our fathers; now will we cease hanging our heads in shame before our children
and wives, our old men and our foreign friends, in sight of whom in days of old we shone forth
conspicuous beyond all other Hellenes."

 (34) See Plut. "Ages." 53 (Clough, vol. iv. p. 41).

The words were scarcely uttered (so runs the tale), when out of the clear sky came lightnings
and thunderings, (35) with propitious manifestation to him; and it so happened that on his
right wing there stood a sacred enclosure and a statue of Heracles, his great ancestor. As
the result of all these things, so deep a strength and courage came into the hearts of his
soldiers, as they tell, that the generals had hard work to restrain their men as they pushed
forward to the front. Presently, when Archidamus led the advance, a few only of the enemy cared
to await them at the spear's point, and were slain; the mass of them fled, and fleeing fell.
Many were cut down by the cavalry, many by the Celts. When the battle ceased and a trophy had
been erected, the Spartan at once despatched home Demoteles, the herald, with the news. He
had to announce not only the greatness of the victory, but the startling fact that, while the
enemy's dead were numerous, not one single Lacedaemonian had been slain. (36) Those in Sparta
to whom the news was brought, as says the story, when they heard it, one and all, beginning
with Agesilaus, and, after him, the elders and the ephors, wept for joy--so close akin are
tears to joy and pain alike. There were others hardly less pleased than the Lacedaemonians
themselves at the misfortune which had overtaken the Arcadians: these were the Thebans and
Eleians--so offensive to them had the boastful behaviour of these men become.

 (35) See Xen. "Apolog." 12; Homer, "Il." ii. 353; "Od." xx. 113 foll.

 (36) According to Diod. xv. 72, ten thousand of the enemy fell.

The problem perpetually working in the minds of the Thebans was how they were to compass the
headship of Hellas; and they persuaded themselves that, if they sent an embassy to the King
of Persia, they could not but gain some advantage by his help. Accordingly they did not delay,
but called together the allies, on the plea that Euthycles the Lacedaemonian was already at
the Persian court. The commissioners sent up were, on the part of the Thebans, Pelopidas; (37)
on the part of the Arcadians, Antiochus, the pancratiast; and on that of the Eleians, Archidamus.
There was also an Argive in attendance. The Athenians on their side, getting wind of the matter,
sent up two commissioners, Timagoras and Leon.

 (37) See Plut. "Pelop." 30 (Clough, vol. ii. p. 230). For the date see
    Grote, "H. G." x. 365, 379; Curtius, "H. G." iv. 460.

When they arrived at the Persian court the influence of Pelopidas was preponderant with the
Persian. He could point out that, besides the fact that the Thebans alone among all the Hellenes
had fought on the king's side at Plataeae, (38) they had never subsequently engaged in military
service against the Persians; nay, the very ground of Lacedaemonian hostility to them was that
they had refused to march against the Persian king with Agesilaus, (39) and would not even
suffer him to sacrifice to Artemis at Aulis (where Agamemnon sacrificed before he set sail
for Asia and captured Troy). In addition, there were two things which contributed to raise
the prestige of Thebes, and redounded to the honour of Pelopidas. These were the victory of
the Thebans at Leuctra, and the indisputable fact that they had invaded and laid waste the
territory of Laconia. Pelopidas went on to point out that the Argives and Arcadians had lately
been defeated in battle by the Lacedaemonians, when his own countrymen were not there to assist.
The Athenian Timagoras supported all these statements of the Theban by independent testimony,
and stood second in honour after Pelopidas.

 (38) See Thuc. iii. 58, 59, 60.

 (39) See above, "Hell." III. iv. 3; Lincke, "Zur. Xen. Krit." p. 315.

At this point of the proceedings Pelopidas was asked by the king, what special clause he desired
inserted in the royal rescript. He replied as follows: "Messene to be independent of Lacedaemon,
and the Athenians to lay up their ships of war. Should either power refuse compliance in these
respects, such refusal to be a casus belli; and any state refusing to take part in the military
proceedings consequent, to be herself the first object of attack." These clauses were drawn
up and read to the ambassadors, when Leon, in the hearing of the king, exclaimed: "Upon my
word! Athenians, it strikes me it is high time you looked for some other friend than the great
king." The secretary reported the comment of the Athenian envoy, and produced presently an
altered copy of the document, with a clause inserted: "If the Athenians have any better and
juster views to propound, let them come to the Persian court and explain them." (40)

 (40) See Grote, "H. G." x. 402; and "Ages." viii. 3.

Thus the ambassadors returned each to his own home and were variously received. Timagoras,
on the indictment of Leon, who proved that his fellow-commissioner not only refused to lodge
with him at the king's court, but in every way played into the hands of Pelopidas, was put
to death. Of the other joint commissioners, the Eleian, Archidamus, was loud in his praises
of the king and his policy, because he had shown a preference to Elis over the Arcadians; while
for a converse reason, because the Arcadian league was slighted, Antiochus not only refused
to accept any gift, but brought back as his report to the general assembly of the Ten Thousand,
(41) that the king appeared to have a large army of confectioners and pastry-cooks, butlers
and doorkeepers; but as for men capable of doing battle with Hellenes, he had looked carefully,
and could not discover any. Besides all which, even the report of his wealth seemed to him,
he said, bombastic nonsense. "Why, the golden plane-tree that is so belauded is not big enough
to furnish shade to a single grasshopper." (42)

 (41) See above, VI. v. 6; Freeman, "Hist. Fed. Gov." 202; Demosth. "F.
    L." 220, etc.

 (42) Or, "the golden plane-tree they romance about would not suffice
    to," etc.

At Thebes a conference of the states had been convened to listen to the great king's letter.
The Persian who bore the missive merely pointed to the royal seal, and read the document; whereupon
the Thebans invited all, who wished to be their friends, to take an oath to what they had just
heard, as binding on the king and on themselves. To which the ambassadors from the states replied
that they had been sent to listen to a report, not to take oaths; if oaths were wanted, they
recommended the Thebans to send ambassadors to the several states. The Arcadian Lycomedes,
moreover, added that the congress ought not to be held at Thebes at all, but at the seat of
war, wherever that might be. This remark brought down the wrath of the Thebans on the speaker;
they exclaimed that he was bent on breaking up the alliance. Whereupon the Arcadian refused
to take a seat in the congress at all, and got up and betook himself off there and then, accompanied
by all the Arcadian envoys. Since, therefore, the assembled representatives refused to take
the oaths at Thebes, the Thebans sent to the different states, one by one in turn, urging each
to undertake solemnly to act in accordance with the great king's rescript. They were persuaded
that no individual state would venture to quarrel with themselves and the Persian monarch at
once. As a matter of fact, however, when they arrived at Corinth--which was the first stated
vist--the Corinthians stood out and gave as their answer, that they had no desire for any common
oath or undertaking with the king. The rest of the states followed suit, giving answers of
a similar tenor, so that this striving after empire on the part of Pelopidas and the Thebans
melted like a cloud-castle into air.

B.C. 367. (43) But Epaminondas was bent on one more effort. With a view to forcing the Arcadians
and the rest of the allies to pay better heed to Thebes, he desired first to secure the adhesion
of the Achaeans, and decided to march an army into Achaea. Accordingly, he persuaded the Argive
Peisias, who was at the head of military affairs in Argos, to seize and occupy Oneion in advance.
Persias, having ascertained that only a sorry guard was maintained over Oneion by Naucles,
the general commanding the Lacedaemonian foreign brigade, and by Timomachus the Athenian, under
cover of night seized and occupied with two thousand heavy infantry the rising ground above
Cenchreae, taking with him provisions for seven days. Within the interval the Thebans arrived
and surmounted the pass of Oneion; whereupon the allied troops with Epaminondas at their head,
advanced into Achaea. The result of the campaign was that the better classes of Achaea gave
in their adhesion to him; and on his personal authority Epaminondas insisted that there should
be no driving of the aristocrats into exile, nor any modification of the constitution. He was
content to take a pledge of fealty from the Achaeans to this effect: "Verily and indeed we
will be your allies, and follow whithersoever the Thebans lead." (44)

 (43) B.C. 367, according to Grote, "H. G." x. 365, note 1; al. B.C.
    366.

 (44) See Freeman, "Hist. Fed. Gov." p. 241: "We read of local
    oligarchies (in the several cities of Achaia) which Epameinondas
    found and left in possession, but which the home government of
    Thebes thought good to expel, and to substitute democracies under
    the protection of Theban harmosts. This policy did not answer, as
    the large bodies of exiles thus formed contrived to recover the
    cities, and to bring them to a far more decided Spartan
    partisanship than before."

So he departed home. The Arcadians, however, and the partisans of the opposite faction in Thebes
were ready with an indictment against him: "Epaminondas," they said, "had merely swept and
garnished Achaea for the Lacedaemonians, and then gone off." The Thebans accordingly resolved
to send governors (45) into the states of Achaea; and those officers on arrival joined with
the commonalty and drove out the better folk, and set up democracies throughout Achaea. On
their side, these exiles coalesced, and, marching upon each separate state in turn, for they
were pretty numerous, speedily won their restoration and dominated the states. As the party
thus reinstated no longer steered a middle course, but went heart and soul into an alliance
with Lacedaemon, the Arcadians found themselves between the upper and the nether millstone--that
is to say, the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans.

 (45) Lit. "harmosts."

At Sicyon, hitherto, (46) the constitution was based on the ancient laws; but at this date
Euphron (who during the Lacedaemonian days had been the greatest man in Sicyon, and whose ambition
it was to hold a like pre-eminence under their opponents) addressed himself to the Argives
and Arcadians as follows: "If the wealthiest classes should ever come into power in Sicyon,
without a doubt the city would take the first opportunity of readopting a Laconian policy;
whereas, if a democracy be set up," he added, "you may rest assured Sicyon will hold fast by
you. All I ask you is to stand by me; I will do the rest. It is I who will call a meeting of
the people; and by that selfsame act I shall give you a pledge of my good faith and present
you with a state firm in its alliance. All this, be assured," he added, "I do because, like
yourselves, I have long ill brooked the pride of Lacedaemon, and shall be glad to escape the
yoke of bondage."

 (46) See Grote, "H. G." x. 379.

These proposals found favour with the Arcadians and the Argives, who gladly gave the assistance
demanded. Euphron straightway, in the market-place, in the presence of the two powers concerned,
(47) proceeded to convene the Demos, as if there were to be a new constitution, based on the
principle of equality. (48) When the convention met, he bade them appoint generals: they might
choose whom they liked. Whereupon they elected Euphron himself, Hippodamus, Cleander, Acrisius,
and Lysander. When these matters were arranged he appointed Adeas, his own son, over the foreign
brigade, in place of the former commander, Lysimenes, whom he removed. His next step was promptly
to secure the fidelity of the foreign mercenaries by various acts of kindness, and to attach
others; and he spared neither the public nor the sacred moneys for this object. He had, to
aid him, further, the property of all the citizens whom he exiled on the ground of Laconism,
and of this without scruple he in every case availed himself. As for his colleagues in office,
some he treacherously put to death, others he exiled, by which means he got everything under
his own power, and was now a tyrant without disguise. The method by which he got the allies
to connive at his doings was twofold. Partly he worked on them by pecuniary aid, partly by
the readiness with which he lent the support of his foreign troops on any campaign to which
they might invite him.

 (47) Lit. "the Argives and the Arcadians."

 (48) Lit. "on fair and equal terms." See Thuc. v. 79.

II

B.C. 366. Matters had so far progressed that the Argives had already fortified the Trikaranon
above the Heraion as an outpost to threaten Phlius, while the Sicyonians were engaged in fortifying
Thyamia (1) on their frontier; and between the two the Phliasians were severely pinched. They
began to suffer from dearth of necessaries; but, in spite of all, remained unshaken in their
alliance. It is the habit of historians, I know, to record with admiration each noble achievement
of the larger powers, but to me it seems a still more worthy task to bring to light the great
exploits of even a little state found faithful in the performance of fair deeds.

 (1) "Thyamia is placed by Ross on the lofty hill of Spiria, the
    northern prolongation of Tricaranum, between the villages Stimanga
    and Skrapani."--"Dict. Anct. Geog." "Phlius."

B.C. 370-369. Now these Phliasians were friends of Lacedaemon while at the zenith of her power.
After her disaster on the field of Leuctra, when many of the Perioeci, and the helots to a
man, revolted; when, more than that, the allies, save only quite a few, forsook her; (2) and
when united Hellas, so to speak, was marching on her--these Phliasians remained stanch in their
allegiance; and, in spite of the hostility of the most powerful states of the Peloponnese,
to wit the Arcardians and the Argives, they insisted on coming to her aid. It fell to their
lot to cross into Prasiae as the rearguard of the reinforcements, which consisted of the men
of Corinth, of Epidaurus and of Troezen, of Hermione, Halieis, and Sicyon and Pellene, in the
days before any of these had revolted. (3) Not even when the commander of the foreign brigade,
picking up the divisions already across, left them behind and was gone--not even so did they
flinch or turn back, but hired a guide from Prasiae, and though the enemy was massed round
Amyclae, slipped through his ranks, as best they could, and so reached Sparta. It was then
that the Lacedaemonians, besides other honours conferred upon them, sent them an ox as a gift
of hospitality.

 (2) See above, "VI." v. 29.

 (3) See "Hell." VII. i. 18.

B.C. 369. Later on, when the enemy had retired from Laconia, the Argives, ill brooking so much
zeal for Lacedaemon on the part of Phlius, marched in full force against the little state,
and fell to ravaging their territory. Even then they remained undaunted; and when the enemy
turned to retire, destroying all that he could lay hands upon, out dashed the cavalry of the
Phliasians and dogged his retreat. And notwithstanding that the Argive's rear consisted of
the whole of his cavalry, with some companies of infantry to support them, they attacked him,
sixty in number, and routed his whole rearguard. They slew, indeed, but a few of them; but,
having so slain that handful, they paused and erected a trophy in full sight of the Argive
army with as little concern as if they had cut down their enemies to a man.

Once again the Lacedaemonians and their allies were guarding Oneion, (4) and the Thebans were
threatening to scale the pass. The Arcadians and Eleians (5) were moving forwards through Nemea
to effect a junction with the Thebans, when a hint was conveyed to them by some Phliasian exiles,
"Only show yourselves before Phlius and the town is yours." An agreement was made, and in the
dead of night a party consisting of the exiles themselves and others with them, about six hundred
in number, planted themselves close under the walls with scaling-ladders. Presently the scouts
from the Trikaranon signalled to the city that the enemy was advancing. The citizens were all
attention; their eyes fixed upon their scouts. Meanwhile the traitors within were likewise
signalling to those seated under lee of the walls "to scale"; and these, scaling up, seized
the arms of the guards, which they found abandoned, and fell to pursuing the day sentinels,
ten in number (one out of each squad of five being always left on day duty). (6) One of these
was put to the sword as he lay asleep, and a second as he was escaping to the Heraion; but
the other eight day-pickets leapt down the wall on the side towards the city, one after another.
The scaling party now found themselves in undisputed possession of the citadel. But the shouting
had reached the city below: the citizens rallied to the rescue; and the enemy began by sallying
forth from the citadel, and did battle in the forefront of the gate leading down to the city.
By and by, being strongly beleaguered by the ever-increasing reinforcements of the citizens,
they retired, falling back upon the citadel; and the citizens along with the enemy forced their
way in. The centre of the citadel was speedily deserted; for the enemy scaled the walls and
towers, and showered blows and missiles upon the citizens below. These defended themselves
from the ground, or pressed the encounter home by climbing the ladders which led to the walls.
Once masters of certain towers on this side and the other of the invaders, the citizens came
to close quarters with them with reckless desperation. The invaders, pushed and pommelled by
dint of such audacity and hard hitting, were cooped up like sheep into narrower and narrower
space. But at that critical moment the Arcadians and the Argives were circling round the city,
and had begun to dig through the walls of the citadel from its upper side. (7) Of the citizens
inside some were beating down their assailants on the wall; (8) others, those of them who were
climbing up from outside and were still on the scaling-ladders, whilst a third set were delivering
battle against those who had mounted the towers. These last had found fire in the men's quarters,
and were engaged in setting the towers and all ablaze, bringing up sheaves of corn and grass--an
ample harvesting, as luck would have it, garnered off the citadel itself. Thereupon the occupants
of the towers, in terror of the flames, leapt down one by one, while those on the walls, under
the blows of the defenders, tumbled off with similar expedition; and as soon as they had once
begun to yield, the whole citadel, in almost less time than it takes to tell, was cleared of
the enemy. In an instant out dashed the cavalry, and the enemy, seeing them, beat a hasty retreat,
leaving behind scaling-ladders and dead, besides some comrades hopelessly maimed. In fact,
the enemy, what between those who were slain inside and those who leapt from the walls, lost
not less than eighty men. And now it was a goodly sight to see the brave men grasp one another
by the hand and pledge each other on their preservation, whilst the women brought them drink
and cried for joy. Not one there present but in very sooth was overcome by laughter mixed with
tears. (9)

Next year also (10) Phlius was invaded by the Argives and all the Arcadians. The reason of
this perpetually-renewed attack on Phlius is not far to seek: partly it was the result of spleen,
partly the little township stood midway between them, and they cherished the hope that through
want of the necessaries of life they would bring it over. During this invasion the cavalry
and the picked troop of the Phliasians, assisted by some Athenian knights, made another famous
charge at the crossing of the river. (11) They made it so hot for the enemy that for the rest
of that day he was forced to retire under the mountain ridges, and to hold aloof as if afraid
to trample down the corn-crops of a friendly people on the flat below.

 (10) B.C. 368 (or 367).

 (11) The Asopus.

Again another time (12) the Theban commander in Sicyon marched out against Phlius, taking with
him the garrison under his personal command, with the Sicyonians and Pellenians (for at the
date of the incident these states followed in the wake of Thebes). Euphron was there also with
his mercenaries, about two thousand in number, to share the fortunes of the field. The mass
of the troops began their descent on the Heraion by the Trikaranon, intending to ravage the
flat bottom below. At the gate leading to Corinth the Theban general left his Sicyonians and
Pellenians on the height, to prevent the Phliasians getting behind him at this point and so
over the heads of his troops as they lay at the Heraion beneath. (13) As soon as the citizens
of Phlius found that hostile troops were advancing on their corn-land, out dashed the cavalry
with the chosen band of the Phliasians and gave battle, not suffering the enemy to penetrate
into the plain. The best part of the day was spent in taking long shots at one another on that
field; Euphron pushing his attack down to the point where cavalry could operate, the citizens
retaliating as far as the Heraion. Presently the time to withdraw had come, and the enemy began
to retire, following the circle of the Trikaranon; the short cut to reach the Pellenians being
barred by the ravine which runs in front of the walls. The Phliasians escorted their retreating
foes a little way up the steep, and then turning off dashed along the road beside the walls,
making for the Pellenians and those with them; whereupon the Theban, perceiving the haste of
the Phliasians, began racing with his infantry to outspeed them and bring succour to the Pellenians.
The cavalry, however, arrived first and fell to attacking the Pellenians, who received and
withstood the shock, and the cavalry drew back. A second time they charged, and were supported
by some infantry detachments, which had now come up. It ended in a hand-to-hand fight; and
eventually the enemy gave way. On the field lay dead some Sicyonians, and of the Pellenians
many a good man. In record of the feat the Phliasians began to raise a trophy, as well they
might; and loud and clear the paean rang. As to the Theban and Euphron, they and all their
men stood by and stared at the proceedings, like men who had raced to see a sight. After all
was over the one party retired to Sicyon and the other withdrew into their city.

 (12) B.C. 367 (or 366).

 (13) Lit. "above the Heraion" (where his main body lay).

That too was another noble exploit of the Phliasians, when they took the Pellenian Proxenus
prisoner and, although suffering from scarcity at the time, sent him back without a ransom.
"As generous as brave," such is their well-earned title who were capable of such performance.

The heroic resolution with which these men maintained their loyalty to their friends is manifest.
When excluded from the fruits of their own soil, they contrived to live, partly by helping
themselves from the enemy's territory, partly by purchasing from Corinth, though to reach that
market they must run the gauntlet of a thousand risks; and having reached it their troubles
began afresh. There were difficulties in providing the requisite sum, difficulties in arranging
with the purveyors, and it was barely possible to find sureties for the very beasts which should
carry home their marketing. They had reached the depth of despair, and were absolutely at a
loss what to do, when they arranged with Chares to escort their convoy. Once safe inside Phlius,
they begged him to help them to convey their useless and sick folk to Pellene. (14) These they
left at that place; and after making purchases and packing as many beasts of burthen as they
could, they set off to return in the night, not in ignorance that they would be laid in wait
for by the enemy, but persuaded that the want of provisions was a worse evil than mere fighting.

 (14) What is the date of this incident? See above, "Hell." VII. ii. 3;
    below VII. iv. 17.

The men of Phlius pushed forward with Chares; presently they stumbled on the enemy and at once
grappled to their work. Pressing hard on the foe, they called cheerily to one another, and
shouted at the same time to Chares to bring up his aid. In short, the victory was theirs; and
the enemy was driven off the road; and so they got themselves and their supplies safely home.
The long night-watching superinduced sleep which lasted well into the next day. But Chares
was no sooner out of bed then he was accosted by the cavalry and the pick of the heavy infantry
with the following appeal: "Chares, to-day you have it in your power to perform the noblest
deed of arms. The Sicyonians are fortifying an outpost on our borders, they have plenty of
stone-masons but a mere handful of hoplites. We the knights of Phlius and we the flower of
our infantry force will lead the way; and you shall follow after with your mercenaries. Perhaps
when you appear on the scene you will find the whole thing finished, or perhaps your coming
will send the enemy flying, as happened at Pellene. If you do not like the sound of these proposals,
sacrifice and take counsel of the gods. Our belief is that the gods will bid you yet more emphatically
than we to take this step. Only this, Chares, you must well consider, that if you do take it
you will have established an outpost on the enemy's frontier; you will have saved from perdition
a friendly city; you will win eternal glory in your own fatherland; and among friends and foes
alike no name will be heralded with louder praise than that of Chares."

Chares was persuaded, and proceeded to offer sacrifice. Meanwhile the Phliasian cavalry were
donning their breastplates and bridling their horses, and the heavy infantry made every preparation
for the march. Then they took their arms, fell into line, and tramped off to the place of sacrifice.
Chares with the soothsayer stepped forward to meet them, announcing that the victims were favourable.
"Only wait for us," they exclaimed; "we will sally forth with you at once." The heralds' cry
"To arms!" was sounded, and with a zeal which was almost miraculous the mercenaries themselves
rushed out. As soon as Chares began the march, the Phliasian cavalry and infantry got in front
of him. At first they led off at a smart pace; presently they began to bowl (15) along more
quickly, and finally the cavalry were tearing over the ground might and main, whilst the infantry,
at the greatest pace compatible with keeping their ranks, tore after them; and behind them,
again, came Chares zealously following up in their rear. There only remained a brief interval
of daylight before the sun went down, and they came upon the enemy in the fortress, some washing,
some cooking a savoury meal, others kneading their bread, others making their beds. These,
when they saw the vehemence of the attack, at once, in utter panic, took to flight, leaving
behind all their provisions for the brave fellows who took their place. They, as their reward,
made a fine supper off these stores and others which had come from home, pouring out libations
for their good fortune and chanting the battle-hymn; after which they posted pickets for the
night and slumbered well. The messenger with the news of their success at Thyamia arrived at
Corinth in the night. The citizens of that state with hearty friendship at once ordered out
by herald all the oxen and beasts of burthen, which they loaded with food and brought to Phlius;
and all the while the fortress was building day by day these convoys of food were duly despatched.

 (15) See "Anab." VII. iii. 46.

III

But on this topic enough, perhaps, has been said to demonstrate the loyalty of the men of Phlius
to their friends, their bravery in war, and, lastly, their steadfastness in maintaining their
alliance in spite of famine.

B.C. 367-366. It seems to have been somewhere about this date that Aeneas the Stymphalian,
(1) who had become general of the Arcadians, finding that the state of affairs in Sicyon was
intolerable, marched up with his army into the acropolis. Here he summoned a meeting of the
Sicyonian aristocrats already within the walls, and sent to fetch those others who had been
banished without a decree of the people. (2) Euphron, taking fright at these proceedings, fled
for safety to the harbour-town of Sicyon. Hither he summoned Pasimelus from Corinth, and by
his instrumentality handed over the harbour to the Lacedaemonians. Once more reappearing in
his old character, he began to pose as an ally of Sparta. He asserted that his fidelity to
Lacedaemon had never been interrupted; for when the votes were given in the city whether Sicyon
should give up her allegiance to Lacedaemon, "I, with one or two others," said he, "voted against
the measure; but afterwards these people betrayed me, and in my desire to avenge myself on
them I set up a democracy. At present all traitors to yourselves are banished--I have seen
to that. If only I could get the power into my own hands, I would go over to you, city and
all, at once. All that I can do at present, I have done; I have surrendered to you this harbour."
That was what Euphron said to his audience there, but of the many who heard his words, how
many really believed his words is by no means evident. However, since I have begun the story
of Euphron, I desire to bring it to its close.

 (1) Is this man the famous writer {o taktikos}, a portion of whose
    works, the "Treatise on Siege Operations," has been preserved
     (recently re-edited by Arnold Hug--"Commentarius Poliorceticus,"
    Lips. Trubner, 1884)? So Casaubon supposed. Cf. "Com. Pol." 27,
    where the writer mentions {paneia} as the Arcadian term for
    "panics." Readers of the "Anabasis" will recollect the tragic end
    of another Aeneas, also of Stymphalus, an Arcadian officer. On the
    official title {strategos} (general), Freeman ("Hist. Fed. Gov."
    204) notes that "at the head of the whole League there seems to
    have been, as in so many other cases, a single Federal general."
    Cf. Diod. xv. 62.

 (2) See above, VII. i. 46.

Faction and party strife ran high in Sicyon between the better classes and the people, when
Euphron, getting a body of foreign troops from Athens, once more obtained his restoration.
The city, with the help of the commons, he was master of, but the Theban governor held the
citadel. Euphron, perceiving that he would never be able to dominate the state whilst the Thebans
held the acropolis, collected money and set off to Thebes, intending to persuade the Thebans
to expel the aristocrats and once again to hand over the city to himself. But the former exiles,
having got wind of this journey of his, and of the whole intrigue, set off themselves to Thebes
in front of him. (3) When, however, they saw the terms of intimacy on which he associated with
the Theban authorities, in terror of his succeeding in his mission some of them staked their
lives on the attempt and stabbed Euphron in the Cadmeia, where the magistrates and senate were
seated. The magistrates, indeed, could not but indict the perpetrators of the deed before the
senate, and spoke as follows:

 (3) Or, "on an opposition journey."

"Fellow-citizens, it is our duty to arraign these murderers of Euphron, the men before you,
on the capital charge. Mankind may be said to fall into two classes: there are the wise and
temperate, (4) who are incapable of any wrong and unhallowed deed; and there are the base,
the bad, who do indeed such things, but try to escape the notice of their fellows. The men
before you are exceptional. They have so far exceeded all the rest of men in audacity and foul
villainy that, in the very presence of the magistrates and of yourselves, who alone have the
power of life and death, they have taken the law into their own hands, (5) and have slain this
man. But they stand now before the bar of justice, and they must needs pay the extreme penalty;
for, if you spare them, what visitor will have courage to approach the city? Nay, what will
become of the city itself, if license is to be given to any one who chooses to murder those
who come here, before they have even explained the object of their visit? It is our part, then,
to prosecute these men as arch-villains and miscreants, whose contempt for law and justice
is only matched by the supreme indifference with which they treat this city. It is your part,
now that you have heard the charges, to impose upon them that penalty which seems to be the
measure of their guilt."

 (4) Lit. "the sound of soul."

 (5) Or, "they have been judge and jury both, and executioners to
    boot."

Such were the words of the magistrates. Among the men thus accused, all save one denied immediate
participation in the act. It was not their hands that had dealt the blow. This one not only
confessed the deed, but made a defence in words somewhat as follows:

"As to treating you with indifference, men of Thebes, that is not possible for a man who knows
that with you lies the power to deal with him as you list. Ask rather on what I based my confidence
when I slew the man; and be well assured that, in the first place, I based it on the conviction
that I was doing right; next, that your verdict will also be right and just. I knew assuredly
how you dealt with Archias (6) and Hypates and that company whom you detected in conduct similar
to that of Euphron: you did not stay for formal voting, but at the first opportunity within
your reach you guided the sword of vengeance, believing that by the verdict of mankind a sentence
of death had already been passed against the conspicuously profane person, the manifest traitor,
and him who lays to his hand to become a tyrant. See, then, what follows. Euphron was liable
on each of these several counts: he was a conspicuously profane person, who took into his keeping
temples rich in votive offerings of gold and silver, and swept them bare of their sacred treasures;
he was an arrant traitor--for what treason could be more manifest than Euphron's? First he
was the bosom friend of Lacedaemon, but presently chose you in their stead; and, after exchange
of solemn pledges between yourselves and him, once more turned round and played the traitor
to you, and delivered up the harbour to your enemies. Lastly, he was most undisguisedly a tyrant,
who made not free men only, but free fellow-citizens his slaves; who put to death, or drove
into exile, or robbed of their wealth and property, not malefactors, note you, but the mere
victims of his whim and fancy; and these were ever the better folk. Once again restored by
the help of your sworn foes and antagonists, the Athenians, to his native town of Sicyon, the
first thing he did was to take up arms against the governor from Thebes; but, finding himself
powerless to drive him from the acropolis, he collected money and betook himself hither. Now,
if it were proved that he had mustered armed bands to attack you, I venture to say, you would
have thanked me that I slew him. What then, when he came furnished with vile moneys, to corrupt
you therewith, to bribe you to make him once more lord and master of the state? How shall I,
who dealt justice upon him, justly suffer death at your hands? For to be worsted in arms implies
injury certainly, but of the body only: the defeated man is not proved to be dishonest by his
loss of victory. But he who is corrupted by filthy lucre, contrary to the standard of what
is best, (7) is at once injured and involved in shame.

 (6) See above, V. iv. 2.

 (7) Or, as we should say, "in violation of conscience."

"Now if he had been your friend, however much he was my national foe, I do confess it had been
scarce honourable of me to have stabbed him to death in your presence: but why, I should like
to ask, should the man who betrayed you be less your enemy than mine? 'Ah, but,' I hear some
one retort, 'he came of his own accord.' I presume, sir, you mean that had he chanced to be
slain by somebody at a distance from your state, that somebody would have won your praise;
but now, on the ground that he came back here to work mischief on the top of mischief, 'he
had the right to live'! (8) In what part of Hellas, tell me, sir, do Hellenes keep a truce
with traitors, double-dyed deserters, and tyrants? Moreover, I must remind you that you passed
a resolution--if I mistake not, it stands recorded in your parliamentary minutes--that 'renegades
are liable to be apprehended (9) in any of the allied cities.' Now, here is a renegade restoring
himself without any common decree of the allied states: will any one tell me on what ground
this person did not deserve to die? What I maintain, sirs, is that if you put me to death,
by so doing you will be aiding and abetting your bitterest foe; while, by a verdict sanctioning
the justice of my conduct, you will prove your willingness to protect the interests not of
yourselves only, but of the whole body of your allies."

 (8) Or, "he was wrongfully slain."

 (9) For this right of extradition see Plut. "Lys." xxvii.

The Thebans on hearing these pleadings decided that Euphron had only suffered the fate which
he deserved. His own countrymen, however, conveyed away the body with the honours due to a
brave and good man, and buried him in the market-place, where they still pay pious reverence
to his memory as "a founder of the state." So strictly, it would seem, do the mass of mankind
confine the term brave and good to those who are the benefactors of themselves.

IV

B.C. 366. And so ends the history of Euphron. I return to the point reached at the commencement
of this digression. (1) The Phliasians were still fortifying Thyamia, and Chares was still
with them, when Oropus (2) was seized by the banished citizens of that place. The Athenians
in consequence despatched an expedition in full force to the point of danger, and recalled
Chares from Thyamia; whereupon the Sicyonians and the Arcadians seized the opportunity to recapture
the harbour of Sicyon. Meanwhile the Athenians, forced to act single-handed, with none of their
allies to assist them, retired from Oropus, leaving that town in the hands of the Thebans as
a deposit till the case at issue could be formally adjudicated.

 (1) See above, VII. ii. 23; iii. 3; Diod. xv. 76.

 (2) See Thuc. viii. 60.

Now Lycomedes (3) had discovered that the Athenians were harbouring a grievance against her
allies, as follows:--They felt it hard that, while Athens was put to vast trouble on their
account, yet in her need not a man among them stepped forward to render help. Accordingly he
persuaded the assembly of Ten Thousand to open negotiations with Athens for the purpose of
forming an alliance. (4) At first some of the Athenians were vexed that they, being friends
of Lacedaemon, should become allied to her opponents; but on further reflection they discovered
it was no less desirable for the Lacedaemonians than for themselves that the Arcadians should
become independent of Thebes. That being so, they were quite ready to accept an Arcadian alliance.
Lycomedes himself was still engaged on this transaction when, taking his departure from Athens,
he died, in a manner which looked like divine intervention.

 (3) See above, VII. i. 23.

 (4) This proves that "the Ten Thousand made war and peace in the name
    of all Arkadia"; cf. "Hell." VII. i. 38; Diod. xv. 59. "They
    received and listened to the ambassadors of other Greek states";
    Demosth. "F. L." 220. "They regulated and paid the standing army
    of the Federation"; "Hell." VII. iv. 22, 23; Diod. xv. 62. "They
    sat in judgment on political offenders against the collective
    majority of the Arkadian League"; "Hell." VII. iv. 33; Freeman,
    "Hist. Fed. Gov." 203, note 1.

Out of the many vessels at his service he had chosen the one he liked best, and by the terms
of contract was entitled to land at any point he might desire; but for some reason, selected
the exact spot where a body of Mantinean exiles lay. Thus he died; but the alliance on which
he had set his heart was already consummated.

Now an argument was advanced by Demotion (5) in the Assembly of Athens, approving highly of
the friendship with the Arcadians, which to his mind was an excellent thing, but arguing that
the generals should be instructed to see that Corinth was kept safe for the Athenian people.
The Corinthians, hearing this, lost no time in despatching garrisons of their own large enough
to take the place of the Athenian garrisons at any point where they might have them, with orders
to these latter to retire: "We have no further need of foreign garrisons," they said. The garrisons
did as they were bid.

 (5) Of Demotion nothing more, I think, is known. Grote ("H. G." x.
    397) says: "The public debates of the Athenian assembly were not
    favourable to the success of a scheme like that proposed by
    Demotion, to which secrecy was indispensable. Compare another
    scheme" (the attempted surprise of Mitylene, B.C. 428), "divulged
    in like manner, in Thuc. iii. 3."

As soon as the Athenian garrison troops were met together in the city of Corinth, the Corinthian
authorities caused proclamation to be made inviting all Athenians who felt themselves wronged
to enter their names and cases upon a list, and they would recover their dues. While things
were in this state, Chares arrived at Cenchreae with a fleet. Learning what had been done,
he told them that he had heard there were designs against the state of Corinth, and had come
to render assistance. The authorities, while thanking him politely for his zeal, were not any
the more ready to admit the vessels into the harbour, but bade him sail away; and after rendering
justice to the infantry troops, they sent them away likewise. Thus the Athenians were quit
of Corinth. To the Arcadians, to be sure, they were forced by the terms of their alliance to
send an auxiliary force of cavalry, "in case of any foreign attack upon Arcadia." At the same
time they were careful not to set foot on Laconian soil for the purposes of war.

The Corinthians had begun to realise on how slender a thread their political existence hung.
They were overmastered by land still as ever, with the further difficulty of Athenian hostility,
or quasi-hostility, now added. They resolved to collect bodies of mercenary troops, both infantry
and horse. At the head of these they were able at once to guard their state and to inflict
much injury on their neighbouring foes. To Thebes, indeed, they sent ambassadors to ascertain
whether they would have any prospect of peace if they came to seek it. The Thebans bade them
come: "Peace they should have." Whereupon the Corinthians asked that they might be allowed
to visit their allies; in making peace they would like to share it with those who cared for
it, and would leave those who preferred war to war. This course also the Thebans sanctioned;
and so the Corinthians came to Lacedaemon and said:

"Men of Lacedaemon, we, your friends, are here to present a petition, and on this wise. If
you can discover any safety for us whilst we persist in warlike courses, we beg that you will
show it us; but if you recognise the hopelessness of our affairs, we would, in that case, proffer
this alternative: if peace is alike conducive to your interests, we beg that you would join
us in making peace, since there is no one with whom we would more gladly share our safety than
with you; if, on the other hand, you are persuaded that war is more to your interest, permit
us at any rate to make peace for ourselves. So saved to-day, perhaps we may live to help you
in days to come; whereas, if to-day we be destroyed, plainly we shall never at any time be
serviceable again."

The Lacedaemonians, on hearing these proposals, counselled the Corinthians to arrange a peace
on their own account; and as for the rest of their allies, they permitted any who did not care
to continue the war along with them to take a respite and recruit themselves. "As for ourselves,"
they said, "we will go on fighting and accept whatever Heaven has in store for us,"--adding,
"never will we submit to be deprived of our territory of Messene, which we received as an heirloom
from our fathers." (6)

 (6) See Isocr. "Or." vi. "Archidamos," S. 70; Jebb, "Att. Or." ii.
    193.

Satisfied with this answer, the Corinthians set off to Thebes in quest of peace. The Thebans,
indeed, asked them to agree on oath, not to peace only but an alliance; to which they answered:
"An alliance meant, not peace, but merely an exchange of war. If they liked, they were ready
there and then," they repeated, "to establish a just and equitable peace." And the Thebans,
admiring the manner in which, albeit in danger, they refused to undertake war against their
benefactors, conceded to them and the Phliasians and the rest who came with them to Thebes,
peace on the principle that each should hold their own territory. On these terms the oaths
were taken.

Thereupon the Phliasians, in obedience to the compact, at once retired from Thyamia; but the
Argives, who had taken the oath of peace on precisely the same terms, finding that they were
unable to procure the continuance of the Phliasian exiles in the Trikaranon as a point held
within the limits of Argos, (7) took over and garrisoned the place, asserting now that this
land was theirs--land which only a little while before they were ravaging as hostile territory.
Further, they refused to submit the case to arbitration in answer to the challenge of the Phliasians.

 (7) Or, "as a post held by them within the territory of the state."
    The passage is perhaps corrupt.

It was nearly at the same date that the son of Dionysius (8) (his father, Dionysius the first,
being already dead) sent a reinforcement to Lacedaemon of twelve triremes under Timocrates,
who on his arrival helped the Lacedaemonians to recover Sellasia, and after that exploit sailed
away home.

 (8) Concerning Dionysius the first, see above, VII. i. 20 foll. 28.

B.C. 366-365. Not long after this the Eleians seized Lasion, (9) a place which in old days
was theirs, but at present was attached to the Arcadian league. The Arcadians did not make
light of the matter, but immediately summoned their troops and rallied to the rescue. Counter-reliefs
came also on the side of Elis--their Three Hundred, and again their Four Hundred. (10) The
Eleians lay encamped during the day face to face with the invader, but on a somewhat more level
position. The Arcadians were thereby induced under cover of night to mount on to the summit
of the hill overhanging the Eleians, and at day-dawn they began their descent upon the enemy.
The Eleians soon caught sight of the enemy advancing from the vantage ground above them, many
times their number; but a sense of shame forbade retreat at such a distance. Presently they
came to close quarters; there was a hand-to-hand encounter; the Eleians turned and fled; and
in retiring down the difficult ground lost many men and many arms.

 (9) See above, VII. i. 26; Freeman, "Hist. Fed. Gov." p. 201.

 (10) From the sequel it would appear that the former were a picked
    corps of infantry and the latter of cavalry. See Thuc. ii. 25;
    Busolt, op. cit. p. 175 foll.

Flushed with this achievement the Arcadians began marching on the cities of the Acroreia, (11)
which, with the exception of Thraustus, they captured, and so reached Olympia. There they made
an entrenched camp on the hill of Kronos, established a garrison, and held control over the
Olympian hill-country. Margana also, by help of a party inside who gave it up, next fell into
their hands.

 (11) The mountainous district of Elis on the borders of Arcadia,  in
    which the rivers Peneius and Ladon take their rise; see "Dict. of
    Anct. Geog." s.v.; above, III. ii. 30, IV. ii. 16. Thraustus was
    one of the four chief townships of the district. For Margana, see
    above, III. ii. 25, 30, IV. ii. 16, VI. v. 2.

These successive advantages gained by their opponents reacted on the Eleians, and threw them
altogether into despair. Meanwhile the Arcadians were steadily advancing upon their capital.
(12) At length they arrived, and penetrated into the market-place. Here, however, the cavalry
and the rest of the Eleians made a stand, drove the enemy out with some loss, and set up a trophy.

 (12) I.e. Elis.

It should be mentioned that the city of Elis had previously been in a state of disruption.
The party of Charopus, Thrasonidas and Argeius were for converting the state into a democracy;
the party of Eualcas, Hippias, and Stratolas (13) were for oligarchy. When the Arcadians, backed
by a large force, appeared as allies of those who favoured a democratic constitution, the party
of Charopus were at once emboldened; and, having obtained the promise of assistance from the
Arcadians, they seized the acropolis. The Knights and the Three Hundred did not hesitate, but
at once marched up and dislodged them; with the result that about four hundred citizens, with
Argeius and Charopus, were banished. Not long afterwards these exiles, with the help of some
Arcadians, seized and occupied Pylus; (14) where many of the commons withdrew from the capital
to join them, attracted not only by the beauty of the position, but by the great power of the
Arcadians, in alliance with them.

 (13) See below, VII. iv. 31; Busolt, op. cit. p. 175.

 (14) Pylus, a town in "hollow" Elis, upon the mountain road from Elis
    to Olympia, at the place where the Ladon flows into the Peneius
    (Paus. VI. xxii. 5), near the modern village of Agrapidokhori.--
    Baedeker, "Greece," p. 320. See Busolt, p. 179.

There was subsequently another invasion of the territory of the Eleians on the part of the
Arcadians, who were influenced by the representations of the exiles that the city would come
over to them. But the attempt proved abortive. The Achaeans, who had now become friends with
the Eleians, kept firm guard on the capital, so that the Arcadians had to retire without further
exploit than that of ravaging the country. Immediately, however, on marching out of Eleian
territory they were informed that the men of Pellene were in Elis; whereupon they executed
a marvellously long night march and seized the Pellenian township of Olurus (15) (the Pellenians
at the date in question having already reverted to their old alliance with Lacedaemon). And
now the men of Pellene, in their turn getting wind of what had happened at Olurus, made their
way round as best they could, and got into their own city of Pellene; after which there was
nothing for it but to carry on war with the Arcadians in Olurus and the whole body of their
own commons; and in spite of their small numbers they did not cease till they had reduced Olurus
by siege.

 (15) This fortress (placed by Leake at modern Xylokastro) lay at the
    entrance of the gorge of the Sys, leading from the Aigialos or
    coast-land into the territory of Pellene, which itself lay about
    sixty stades from the sea at modern Zougra. For the part played by
    Pellene as one of the twelve Achaean states at this period, see
    above.

B.C. 365. (16) The Arcadians were presently engaged on another campaign against Elis. While
they were encamped between Cyllene (17) and the capital the Eleians attacked them, but the
Arcadians made a stand and won the battle. Andromachus, the Eleian cavalry general, who was
regarded as responsible for the engagement, made an end of himself; and the rest withdrew into
the city. This battle cost the life also of another there present--the Spartan Socleides; since,
it will be understood, the Lacedaemonians had by this time become allies of the Eleians. Consequently
the Eleians, being sore pressed on their own territory, sent an embassy and begged the Lacedaemonians
to organise an expedition against the Arcadians. They were persuaded that in this way they
would best arrest the progress of the Arcadians, who would thus be placed between the two foes.
In accordance with this suggestion Archidamus marched out with a body of the city troops and
seized Cromnus. (18) Here he left a garrison--three out of the twelve regiments (19)--and so
withdrew homewards. The Arcadians had just ended their Eleian campaign, and, without disbanding
their levies, hastened to the rescue, surrounded Cromnus with a double line of trenches, and
having so secured their position, proceeded to lay siege to those inside the place. The city
of Lacedaemon, annoyed at the siege of their citizens, sent out an army, again under Archidamus,
who, when he had come, set about ravaging Arcadia to the best of his power, as also the Sciritid,
and did all he could to draw off, if possible, the besieging army. The Arcadians, for all that,
were not one whit the more to be stirred: they seemed callous to all his proceedings.

    10.

Presently espying a certain rising ground, across which the Arcadians had drawn their outer
line of circumvallation, Archidamus proposed to himself to take it. If he were once in command
of that knoll, the besiegers at its foot would be forced to retire. Accordingly he set about
leading a body of troops round to the point in question, and during this movement the light
infantry in advance of Archidamus, advancing at the double, caught sight of the Arcadian Eparitoi
(20) outside the stockade and attacked them, while the cavalry made an attempt to enforce their
attack simultaneously. The Arcadians did not swerve: in compact order they waited impassively.
The Lacedaemonians charged a second time: a second time they swerved not, but on the contrary
began advancing. Then, as the hoarse roar and shouting deepened, Archidamus himself advanced
in support of his troops. To do so he turned aside along the carriage-road leading to Cromnus,
and moved onward in column two abreast, (21) which was his natural order. When they came into
close proximity to one another--Archidamus's troops in column, seeing they were marching along
a road; the Arcadians in compact order with shields interlinked--at this conjuncture the Lacedaemonians
were not able to hold out for any length of time against the numbers of the Arcadians. Before
long Archidamus had received a wound which pierced through his thigh, whilst death was busy
with those who fought in front of him, Polyaenidas and Chilon, who was wedded to the sister
of Archidamus, included. The whole of these, numbering no less than thirty, perished in this
action. Presently, falling back along the road, they emerged into the open ground, and now
with a sense of relief the Lacedaemonians got themselves into battle order, facing the foe.
The Arcadians, without altering their position, stood in compact line, and though falling short
in actual numbers, were in far better heart--the moral result of an attack on a retreating
enemy and the severe loss inflicted on him. The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, were sorely
down-hearted: Archidamus lay wounded before their eyes; in their ears rang the names of those
who had died, the fallen being not only brave men, but, one may say, the flower of Spartan
chivalry. The two armies were now close together, when one of the older men lifted up his voice
and cried: "Why need we fight, sirs? Why not rather make truce and part friends?" Joyously
the words fell on the ears of either host, and they made a truce. The Lacedaemonians picked
up their dead and retired; the Arcadians withdrew to the point where their advance originally
began, and set up a trophy of victory.

 (20) So the troops of the Arcadian Federation were named. Diodorus
    (xv. 62) calls them "the select troops," {tous kaloumenous
    epilektous}.

 (21) See above, III. i. 22.

Now, as the Arcadians lay at Cromnus, the Eleians from the capital, advancing in the first
instance upon Pylus, fell in with the men of that place, who had been beaten back from Thalamae.
(22) Galloping along the road, the cavalry of the Eleians, when they caught sight of them,
did not hesitate, but dashed at them at once, and put some to the sword, while others of them
fled for safety to a rising knoll. Ere long the Eleian infantry arrived, and succeeded in dislodging
this remnant on the hillock also; some they slew, and others, nearly two hundred in number,
they took alive, all of whom where either sold, if foreigners, or, if Eleian exiles, put to
death. After this the Eleians captured the men of Pylus and the place itself, as no one came
to their rescue, and recovered the Marganians.

 (22) A strong fortress in an unfrequented situation, defended by
    narrow passes (Leake, "Morea," ii. 204); it lay probably in the
    rocky recesses of Mount Scollis (modern Santameri), on the
    frontier of Achaea, near the modern village of Santameri. See
    Polyb. iv. 75. See Busolt, op. cit. p. 179.

The Lacedaemonians presently made a second attempt on Cromnus by a night attack, got possession
of the part of the palisading facing the Argives, and at once began summoning their besieged
fellow-citizens to come out. Out accordingly came all who happened to be within easy distance,
and who took time by the forelock. The rest were not quick enough; a strong Arcadian reinforcement
cut them off, and they remained shut up inside, and were eventually taken prisoners and distributed.
One portion of them fell to the lot of the Argives, one to the Thebans, (23) one to the Arcadians,
and one to the Messenians. The whole number taken, whether true-born Spartans or Perioeci,
amounted to more than one hundred.

 (23) "The Thebans must have been soldiers in garrison at Tegea,
    Megalopolis, or Messene."--Grote, "H. G." x. 433.

B.C. 364. And now that the Arcadians had leisure on the side of Cromnus, they were again able
to occupy themselves with the Eleians, and to keep Olympia still more strongly garrisoned.
In anticipation of the approaching Olympic year, (24) they began preparations to celebrate
the Olympian games in conjunction with the men of Pisa, who claim to be the original presidents
of the Temple. (25) Now, when the month of the Olympic Festival--and not the month only, but
the very days, during which the solemn assembly is wont to meet, were come, the Eleians, in
pursuance of preparations and invitations to the Achaeans, of which they made no secret, at
length proceeded to march along the road to Olympia. The Arcadians had never imagined that
they would really attack them; and they were themselves just now engaged with the men of Pisa
in carrying out the details of the solemn assembly. They had already completed the chariot-race,
and the foot-race of the pentathlon. (26) The competitors entitled to enter for the wrestling
match had left the racecourse, and were getting through their bouts in the space between the
racecourse and the great altar.

 (24) I.e. "Ol. 104. 1" (July B.C. 364).

 (25) For this claim on the part of the Pisatans (as the old
    inhabitants), see above, III. ii. 31; Paus. VI. xxii. 2; Diod. xv.
    78; Busolt, op. cit. p. 154.

 (26) As to the pentathlon, see above, IV. vii. 5. Whether the
    preceding {ippodromia} was, at this date, a horse or chariot race,
    or both, I am unable to say.

It must be understood that the Eleians under arms were already close at hand within the sacred
enclosure. (27) The Arcadians, without advancing farther to meet them, drew up their troops
on the river Cladaus, which flows past the Altis and discharges itself into the Alpheus. Their
allies, consisting of two hundred Argive hoplites and about four hundred Athenian cavalry,
were there to support them. Presently the Eleians formed into line on the opposite side of
the stream, and, having sacrificed, at once began advancing. Though heretofore in matters of
war despised by Arcadians and Argives, by Achaeans and Athenians alike, still on this day they
led the van of the allied force like the bravest of the brave. Coming into collision with the
Arcadians first, they at once put them to flight, and next receiving the attack of the Argive
supports, mastered these also. Then having pursued them into the space between the senate-house,
the temple of Hestia, and the theatre thereto adjoining, they still kept up the fighting as
fiercely as ever, pushing the retreating foe towards the great altar. But now being exposed
to missiles from the porticoes and the senate-house and the great temple, (28) while battling
with their opponents on the level, some of the Eleians were slain, and amongst others the commander
of the Three Hundred himself, Stratolas. At this state of the proceedings they retired to their
camp.

 (27) "The {temenos} must here be distinguished from the Altis, as
    meaning the entire breadth of consecrated ground at Olympia, of
    which the Altis formed a smaller interior portion enclosed with a
    wall. The Eleians entered into a {temenos} before they crossed the
    river Kladeus, which flowed through the {temenos}, but alongside
    the Altis. The tomb of Oenomaus, which was doubtless included in
    the {temenos}, was on the right bank of the Kladeus (Paus. VI.
    xxi. 3); while the Altis was on the left bank of the river."--
    Grote, "H. G." x. 438, note 1. For the position of the Altis
    (Paus. V. x. 1) and several of the buildings here mentioned, and
    the topography of Olympia in general, see Baedeker's "Greece," p.
    322 foll.; and Dorpfeld's Plan ("Olympia und Umgegend," Berlin,
    1882), there reproduced.

 (28) Or, "from the porticoes of the senate-house and the great
    temple."

The Arcadians and those with them were so terrified at the thought of the coming day that they
gave themselves neither respite nor repose that night, but fell to chopping up the carefully-compacted
booths and constructing them into palisades; so that when the Eleians did again advance the
next day and saw the strength of the barriers and the number mounted on the temples, they withdrew
to their city. They had proved themselves to be warriors of such mettle as a god indeed by
the breath of his spirit may raise up and bring to perfection in a single day, but into which
it were impossible for mortal men to convert a coward even in a lifetime.

B.C. 363. The employment of the sacred treasures of the temple by the Arcadian magistrates
(29) as a means of maintaining the Eparitoi (30) aroused protest. The Mantineans were the first
to pass a resolution forbidding such use of the sacred property. They set the example themselves
of providing the necessary quota for the Troop in question from their state exchequer, and
this sum they sent to the federal government. The latter, affirming that the Mantineans were
undermining the Arcadian league, retaliated by citing their leading statesmen to appear before
the assembly of Ten Thousand; and on their refusal to obey the summons, passed sentence upon
them, and sent the Eparitoi to apprehend them as convicted persons. The Mantineans, however,
closed their gates, and would not admit the Troop within their walls. Their example was speedily
followed: others among the Ten Thousand began to protest against the enormity of so applying
the sacred treasures; it was doubly wrong to leave as a perpetual heirloom to their children
the imputation of a crime so heinous against the gods. But no sooner was a resolution passed
in the general assembly (31) forbidding the use of the sacred moneys for profane purposes than
those (members of the league) who could not have afforded to serve as Eparitoi without pay
began speedily to melt away; while those of more independent means, with mutual encouragement,
began to enrol themselves in the ranks of the Eparitoi--the feeling being that they ought not
to be a mere tool in the hands of the corps, but rather that the corps itself should be their
instrument. Those members of the government who had manipulated the sacred money soon saw that
when they came to render an account of their stewardship, in all likelihood they would lose
their heads. They therefore sent an embassy to Thebes, with instructions to the Theban authorities
warning them that, if they did not open a campaign, the Arcadians would in all probability
again veer round to Lacedaemon.

 (29) See above, VII. i. 24. "Were these magistrates, or merely popular
    leaders?"--Freeman, "Hist. Fed. Gov." p. 203, note 3.

 (30) Or, "Select Troop." See above.

 (31) "The common formula for a Greek confederation, {to koinon ton
    'Arkadon}, is used as an equivalent of {oi mupioi}" (here and
    below, SS. 35, 38)--Freeman, op. cit. 202, note 4.

The Thebans, therefore, began making preparations for opening a campaign, but the party who
consulted the best interests of Peloponnese (32) persuaded the general assembly of the Arcadians
to send an embassy and tell the Thebans not to advance with an army into Arcadia, unless they
sent for them; and whilst this was the language they addressed to Thebes, they reasoned among
themselves that they could dispense with war altogether. The presidency over the temple of
Zeus, they were persuaded, they might easily dispense with; indeed, it would at once be a more
upright and a holier proceeding on their parts to give it back, and with such conduct the god,
they thought, might be better pleased. As these were also the views and wishes of the Eleians,
both parties agreed to make peace, and a truce was established.

 (32) See below, VII. v. 1, {oi kedouenoi tes Peloponnesou}. I regard
    these phrases as self-laudatory political catchwords.

B.C. 362. The oaths were ratified; and amongst those who swore to them were included not only
the parties immediately concerned, but the men of Tegea, and the Theban general himself, who
was inside Tegea with three hundred heavy infantry of the Boeotians. Under these circumstances
the Arcadians in Tegea remained behind feasting and keeping holy day, with outpouring of libations
and songs of victory, to celebrate the establishment of peace. Here was an opportunity for
the Theban and those of the government who regarded the forthcoming inquiry with apprehension.
Aided by the Boeotians and those of the Eparitoi who shared their sentiments, they first closed
the gates of the fortress of Tegea, and then set about sending to the various quarters to apprehend
those of the better class. But, inasmuch as there were Arcadians present from all the cities,
and there was a general desire for peace, those apprehended must needs be many. So much so,
that the prison-house was eventually full to overflowing, and the town-hall was full also.
Besides the number lodged in prison, a number had escaped by leaping down the walls, and there
were others who were suffered to pass through the gates (a laxity easily explained, since no
one, excepting those who were anticipating their own downfall, cherished any wrathful feeling
against anybody). But what was a source of still graver perplexity to the Theban commander
and those acting with him--of the Mantineans, the very people whom they had set their hearts
on catching, they had got but very few. Nearly all of them, owing to the proximity of their
city, had, in fact, betaken themselves home. Now, when day came and the Mantineans learned
what had happened, they immediately sent and forewarned the other Arcadian states to be ready
in arms, and to guard the passes; and they set the example themselves by so doing. They sent
at the same time to Tegea and demanded the release of all Mantineans there detained. With regard
to the rest of the Arcadians they further claimed that no one should be imprisoned or put to
death without trial. If any one had any accusation to bring against any, than by the mouth
of their messengers there present they gave notice that the state of Mantinea was ready to
offer bail, "Verily and indeed to produce before the general assembly of the Arcadians all
who might be summoned into court." The Theban accordingly, on hearing this, was at a loss what
to make of the affair, and released his prisoners. Next day, summoning a congress of all the
Arcadians who chose to come, he explained, with some show of apology, that he had been altogether
deceived; he had heard, he said, that "the Lacedaemonians were under arms on the frontier,
and that some of the Arcadians were about to betray Tegea into their hands." His auditors acquitted
him for the moment, albeit they knew that as touching themselves he was lying. They sent, however,
an embassy to Thebes and there accused him as deserving of death. Epaminondas (who was at that
time the general at the head of the war department) is reported to have maintained that the
Theban commander had acted far more rightly when he seized than when he let go the prisoners.
"Thanks to you," he argued, "we have been brought into a state of war, and then you, without
our advice or opinion asked, make peace on your own account; would it not be reasonable to
retort upon you the charge of treason in such conduct? Anyhow, be assured," he added, "we shall
bring an army into Arcadia, and along with those who share our views carry on the war which
we have undertaken."

V

B.C. 362. This answer was duly reported to the general assembly of the Arcadians, and throughout
the several states of the league. Consequently the Mantineans, along with those of the Arcadians
who had the interests of Peloponnesus at heart, as also the Eleians and the Achaeans, came
to the conclusion that the policy of the Thebans was plain. They wished Peloponnesus to be
reduced to such an extremity of weakness that it might fall an easy prey into their hands who
were minded to enslave it. "Why else," they asked, "should they wish us to fight, except that
we may tear each other to pieces, and both sides be driven to look to them for support? or
why, when we tell them that we have no need of them at present, do they insist on preparing
for a foreign campaign? Is it not plain that these preparations are for an expedition which
will do us some mischief?"

In this mood they sent to Athens, (1) calling on the Athenians for military aid. Ambassadors
also went to Lacedaemon on behalf of the Eparitoi, summoning the Lacedaemonians, if they wished
to give a helping hand, to put a stop to the proceedings of any power approaching to enslave
Peloponnesus. As regards the headship, they came to an arrangement at once, on the principle
that each of the allied states should exercise the generalship within its own territory.

    Eleians, and Phliasians, immediately before Mantinea, B.C. 362,

    405. It is preserved on a stele ("broken at bottom; but the top is
    surmounted by a relief representing Zeus enthroned, with a
    thunderbolt; a female figure  (= the {Summakhia}?) approaches

    sculptures from the Asklepieion on the Acropolis at Athens. See
    Milchhofer, p. 47, no. 7, "Die Museum," Athens, 1881. For the
    date, see Demosth. "c. Polycl." 1207.

While these matters were in progress, Epaminondas was prosecuting his march at the head of
all the Boeotians, with the Euboeans, and a large body of Thessalians, furnished both by Alexander
(2) and by his opponents. The Phocians were not represented. Their special agreement only required
them to render assistance in case of an attack on Thebes; to assist in a hostile expedition
against others was not in the bond. Epaminondas, however, reflected that inside Peloponnesus
itself they might count upon the Argives and the Messenians, with that section of the Arcadians
which shared their views. These latter were the men of Tegea and Megalopolis, of Asea and Pallantium,
with any townships which owing to their small size or their position in the midst of these
larger cities were forced to follow their lead.

 (2) For Alexander of Pherae, see above, VI. iv. 34. In B.C. 363 the
    Thebans had sent an army under Pelopidas into Thessaly to assist
    their allies among the Thessalians with the Phthiot Achaeans and
    the Magnetes against Alexander. At Kynos Kephelae Alexander was
    defeated, but Pelopidas was slain (see Grote, "H. G." x. 420
    foll.). "Pelop." 35 (Clough, ii.
    236).

Epaminondas advanced with rapid strides; but on reaching Nemea he slackened speed, hoping to
catch the Athenians as they passed, and reflecting on the magnitude of such an achievement,
whether in stimulating the courage of his own allies, or in plunging his foes into despondency;
since, to state the matter concisely, any blow to Athens would be a gain to Thebes. But during
his pause at Nemea those who shared the opposite policy had time to converge on Mantinea. Presently
the news reached Epaminondas that the Athenians had abandoned the idea of marching by land,
and were preparing to bring their supports to Arcadia by sea through Lacedaemon. This being
so, he abandoned his base of Nemea and pushed on to Tegea.

That the strategy of the Theban general was fortunate I will not pretend to assert, but in
the particular combination of prudence and daring which stamps these exploits, I look upon
him as consummate. In the first place, I cannot but admire the sagacity which led him to form
his camp within the walls of Tegea, where he was in greater security that he would have been
if entrenched outside, and where his future movements were more completely concealed from the
enemy. Again, the means to collect material and furnish himself with other necessaries were
readier to his hand inside the city; while, thirdly, he was able to keep an eye on the movements
of his opponents marching outside, and to watch their successful dispositions as well as their
mistakes. More than this: in spite of his sense of superiority to his antagonists, over and
over again, when he saw them gaining some advantage in position, he refused to be drawn out
to attack them. It was only when he saw plainly that no city was going to give him its adhesion,
and that time was slipping by, that he made up his mind that a blow must be struck, failing
which, he had nothing to expect save a vast ingloriousness, in place of his former fame. (3)
He had ascertained that his antagonists held a strong position round Mantinea, and that they
had sent to fetch Agesilaus and the whole Lacedaemonian army. He was further aware that Agesilaus
had commenced his advance and was already at Pellene. (4) Accordingly he passed the word of
command (5) to his troops to take their evening meal, put himself at their head and advanced
straight upon Sparta. Had it not been for the arrival (by some providential chance) of a Cretan,
who brought the news to Agesilaus of the enemy's advance, he would have captured the city of
Sparta like a nest of young birds absolutely bereft of its natural defenders. As it was, Agesilaus,
being forewarned, had time to return to the city before the Thebans came, and here the Spartans
made distribution of their scanty force and maintained watch and ward, albeit few enough in
numbers, since the whole of their cavalry were away in Arcadia, and so was their foreign brigade,
and so were three out of their twelve regiments. (6)

 (3) Or, "dull obscurity in place of renown."

    road from Sparta to Arcadia; in fact the frontier fortress on the

    see Paus. iii. 20, S. 2; Strab. viii. 386; Polyb. iv. 81, xvi. 37;

 (6) Lit. "lochi." See above, VII. iv. 20; "Pol. Lac." xi. 4.

Arrived within the city of Sparta, (7) Epaminondas abstained from gaining an entry at a point
where his troops would have to fight on level ground and under attack from the houses above;
where also their large numbers would give them no superiority over the small numbers of the
foemen. But, singling out a position which he conceived would give him the advantage, he occupied
it and began his advance against the city upon a downward instead of an upward incline.

 (7) Grote ("H. G." x. 455) says: "Though he crossed the Eurotas and
    actually entered into the city of Sparta," as the words {epei de
    egeneto en te polei ton Spartiaton} certainly seem to me to imply.
    Others interpret "in the close neighbourhood of."

With regard to what subsequently took place, two possible explanations suggest themselves:
either it was miraculous, or it may be maintained that there is no resisting the fury of desperation.
Archidamus, advancing at the head of but a hundred men, and crossing the one thing which might
have been expected to form an obstacle to the enemy, (8) began marching uphill against his
antagonists. At this crisis these fire-breathing warriors, these victorious heroes of Leuctra,
(9) with their superiority at every point, aided, moreover, by the advantage of their position,
did not withstand the attack of Archidamus and those with him, but swerved in flight.

 (8) Or, "to serve as his defence"; or, "the one obstacle to his
    progress," i.e. Archidamus's. It was a miraculous thing that the
    Thebans did not stop him.

 (9) See Mahaffy, "Hist. Gk. Lit." vol. ii. p. 268, 1st ed. See above,
    "Hell." VI. iv. 24; Diod. xv. 39, 56.

The vanguard of Epaminondas's troops were cut down; when, however, flushed with the glory of
their victory, the citizens followed up their pursuit beyond the right point, they in turn
were cut down--so plainly was the demarking line of victory drawn by the finger of God. So
then Archidamus set up a trophy to note the limit of his success, and gave back those who had
there fallen of the enemy under a truce. Epaminondas, on his side, reflecting that the Arcadians
must already be hastening to the relief of Lacedaemon, and being unwilling to engage them in
conjunction with the whole of the Lacedaemonian force, especially now that the star of Sparta's
fortune shone, whilst theirs had suffered some eclipse, turned and marched back the way he
came with all speed possible into Tegea. There he gave his heavy infantry pause and refreshment,
but his cavalry he sent on to Mantinea; he begged them to "have courage and hold on," instructing
them that in all likelihood they would find the flocks and herds of the Mantineans and the
entire population itself outside their walls, especially as it was the moment for carrying
the corn. So they set off.

The Athenian cavalry, started from Eleusis, had made their evening meal at the Isthmus, and
passing through Cleonae, as chance befell, had arrived at Mantinea and had encamped within
the walls in the houses. As soon as the enemy were seen galloping up with evidently hostile
intent, the Mantineans fell to praying the Athenian knights to lend them all the succour they
could, and they showed them all their cattle outside, and all their labourers, and among them
were many children and graybeards who were free-born citizens. The Athenians were touched by
this appeal, and, though they had not yet broken fast, neither the men themselves nor their
horses, went out eagerly to the rescue. And here we must needs pause to admire the valour of
these men also. The enemy whom they had to cope with far outnumbered them, as was plain to
see, and the former misadventure of the cavalry in Corinth was not forgotten. (10) But none
of these things entered into their calculations now--nor yet the fact that they were on the
point of engaging Thebans and Thessalians, the finest cavalry in the world by all repute. The
only thing they thought of was the shame and the dishonour, if, being there, they did not lend
a helping hand to their allies. In this mood, so soon as they caught sight of the enemy, they
fell with a crash upon him in passionate longing to recover the old ancestral glory. Nor did
they fight in vain--the blows they struck enabled the Mantineans to recover all their property
outside, but among those who dealt them died some brave heroes; (11) brave heroes also, it
is evident, were those whom they slew, since on either side the weapons wielded were not so
short but that they could lunge at one another with effect. The dead bodies of their own men
they refused to abandon; and there were some of the enemy's slain whom they restored to him
under a flag of truce.

 (10) Or, "and in Corinth an untoward incident had been experienced by
    the cavalry." See Grote, "H. G." x. 458, note 2. Possibly in
    reference to "Hell." VI. v. 51, 52.

 (11) Probably Xenophon's own son Gryllus was among them.

The thoughts now working in the mind of Epaminondas were such as these: that within a few days
he would be forced to retire, as the period of the campaign was drawing to a close; if it ended
in his leaving in the lurch those allies whom he came out to assist, they would be besieged
by their antagonists. What a blow would that be to his own fair fame, already somewhat tarnished!
Had he not been defeated in Lacedaemon, with a large body of heavy infantry, by a handful of
men? defeated again at Mantinea, in the cavalry engagement, and himself the main cause finally
of a coalition between five great powers--that is to say, the Lacedaemonians, the Arcadians,
the Achaeans, the Eleians, and the Athenians? On all grounds it seemed to him impossible to
steal past without a battle. And the more so as he computed the alternatives of victory or
death. If the former were his fortune, it would resolve all his perplexities; if death, his
end would be noble. How glorious a thing to die in the endeavour to leave behind him, as his
last legacy to his fatherland, the empire of Peloponnesus! That such thoughts should pass through
his brain strikes me as by no means wonderful, as these are thoughts distinctive to all men
of high ambition. Far more wonderful to my mind was the pitch of perfection to which he had
brought his army. There was no labour which his troops would shrink from, either by night or
by day; there was no danger they would flinch from; and, with the scantiest provisions, their
discipline never failed them.

And so, when he gave his last orders to them to prepare for impending battle, they obeyed with
alacrity. He gave the word; the cavalry fell to whitening their helmets, the heavy infantry
of the Arcadians began inscribing their clubs as the crest on their shields, (12) as though
they were Thebans, and all were engaged in sharpening their lances and swords and polishing
their heavy shields. When the preparations were complete and he had led them out, his next
movement is worthy of attention. First, as was natural, he paid heed to their formation, and
in so doing seemed to give clear evidence that he intended battle; but no sooner was the army
drawn up in the formation which he preferred, than he advanced, not by the shortest route to
meet the enemy, but towards the westward-lying mountains which face Tegea, and by this movement
created in the enemy an expectation that he would not do battle on that day. In keeping with
this expectation, as soon as he arrived at the mountain-region, he extended his phalanx in
long line and piled arms under the high cliffs; and to all appearance he was there encamping.
The effect of this manouvre on the enemy in general was to relax the prepared bent of their
souls for battle, and to weaken their tactical arrangements. Presently, however, wheeling his
regiments (which were marching in column) to the front, with the effect of strengthening the
beak-like (13) attack which he proposed to lead himself, at the same instant he gave the order,
"Shoulder arms, forward," and led the way, the troops following.

 (12) Grote ("H. G." x. 463) has another interpretation.

 (13) Or, "the wedge-like attack of his own division"; see Grote, "H.
    G." x. 469 foll. I do not, however, think that the attacking
    column was actually wedge-shaped like the "acies cuneata" of the
    Romans. It was the unusual depth of the column which gave it the
    force of an ironclad's ram. Cf. "Cyrop." II. iv. for {eis
    metopon}.

When the enemy saw them so unexpectedly approaching, not one of them was able to maintain tranquility:
some began running to their divisions, some fell into line, some might be seen bitting and
bridling their horses, some donning their cuirasses, and one and all were like men about to
receive rather than to inflict a blow. He, the while, with steady impetus pushed forward his
armament, like a ship-of-war prow forward. Wherever he brought his solid wedge to bear, he
meant to cleave through the opposing mass, and crumble his adversary's host to pieces. With
this design he prepared to throw the brunt of the fighting on the strongest half of his army,
while he kept the weaker portion of it in the background, knowing certainly that if worsted
it would only cause discouragement to his own division and add force to the foe. The cavalry
on the side of his opponents were disposed like an ordinary phalanx of heavy infantry, regular
in depth and unsupported by foot-soldiers interspersed among the horses. (14) Epaminondas again
differed in strengthening the attacking point of his cavalry, besides which he interspersed
footmen between their lines in the belief that, when he had once cut through the cavalry, he
would have wrested victory from the antagonist along his whole line; so hard is it to find
troops who will care to keep their own ground when once they see any of their own side flying.
Lastly, to prevent any attempt on the part of the Athenians, who were on the enemy's left wing,
to bring up their reliefs in support of the portion next them, he posted bodies of cavalry
and heavy infantry on certain hillocks in front of them, intending to create in their minds
an apprehension that, in case they offered such assistance, they would be attacked on their
own rear by these detachments. Such was the plan of encounter which he formed and executed;
nor was he cheated in his hopes. He had so much the mastery at his point of attack that he
caused the whole of the enemy's troops to take flight.

 (14) See Rustow and Kochly, p. 176; and for the {amippoi}
    Harpocration, s.v.; Pollus, i. 131; "Hipparch." v. 13; Thuc. v.
    58; Herod. vii. 158; Caes. "B. G." i. 48; "B. Civ." iii. 84.

But after he himself had fallen, the rest of the Thebans were not able any longer to turn their
victory rightly to account. Though the main battle line of their opponents had given way, not
a single man afterwards did the victorious hoplites slay, not an inch forward did they advance
from the ground on which the collision took place. Though the cavalry had fled before them,
there was no pursuit; not a man, horseman or hoplite, did the conquering cavalry cut down;
but, like men who have suffered a defeat, as if panic-stricken (15) they slipped back through
the ranks of the fleeing foemen. Only the footmen fighting amongst the cavalry and the light
infantry, who had together shared in the victory of the cavalry, found their way round to the
left wing as masters of the field, but it cost them dear; here they encountered the Athenians,
and most of them were cut down.

 (15) Or, "they timorously slipped back."

The effective result of these achievements was the very opposite of that which the world at
large anticipated. Here, where well-nigh the whole of Hellas was met together in one field,
and the combatants stood rank against rank confronted, there was no one doubted that, in the
event of battle, the conquerors would this day rule; and that those who lost would be their
subjects. But God so ordered it that both belligerents alike set up trophies as claiming victory,
and neither interfered with the other in the act. Both parties alike gave back their enemy's
dead under a truce, and in right of victory; both alike, in symbol of defeat, under a truce
took back their dead. And though both claimed to have won the day, neither could show that
he had thereby gained any accession of territory, or state, or empire, or was better situated
than before the battle. Uncertainty and confusion, indeed, had gained ground, being tenfold
greater throughout the length and breadth of Hellas after the battle than before.

At this point I lay aside my pen: the sequel of the story may haply commend itself (16) to another.
