the Elegy is beautifully elegant and even, but not any better than the memory of the best of
Highlanders and the truest of gentlemen, to whom you composed it, deserved, said Big Rory).
This was the general verdict of the circle.

Norman was now called upon to fulfil his part of the arrangement, which he promptly did by
giving the Legend, of which the following is a translation:--

THE RAID OF CILLIECHRIOST.

THE ancient Chapel of Cilliechriost, in the Parish of Urray, in Ross, was the scene of one
of the bloodiest acts of ferocity and revenge that history has recorded. The original building
has long since disappeared, but the lonely and beautifully situated burying-ground is still
in use. The tragedy originated in the many quarrels which arose between the two chiefs of the
North Highlands--Mackenzie of Kintail and Macdonald of Glengarry. As usual, the dispute was
regarding land, but it were not easy to arrive at the degree of blame to which each party was
entitled, enough that there was bad blood between these two paladins of the north. Of course,
the quarrel was not allowed to go to sleep for lack of action on the part of their friends
and clansmen. The Macdonalds having made several raids on the Mackenzie country, the Mackenzies
retaliated by the spoiling of Morar with a large and overwhelming force. The Macdonalds, taking
advantage of Kenneth Mackenzie's visit to Mull with the view to influence Maclean to induce
the former to peace, once more committed great devastation in the Mackenzie country, under
the leadership of Glengarry's son Angus. From Kintail and Lochalsh the clan of the Mackenzies
gathered fast, but too late to prevent Macdonald from escaping to sea with his boats loaded
with the foray. A portion of the Mackenzies ran to Eilean-donan, while another portion sped
to the narrow strait of the Kyle between Skye and the mainland, through which the Macdonalds,
on their return, of necessity, must pass. At Eilean-donan Lady Mackenzie furnished them with
two boats, one ten-oared and one four-oared, also with arrows and ammunition. Though without
their chief, the Mackenzies sallied forth, and rowing towards Kyleakin, lay in wait for the
approach of the Macdonalds. The first of the Glengarry boats they allowed to pass unchallenged,
but the second, which was the thirty-two-oared galley of the chief was furiously attacked.
The unprepared Macdonalds rushing to the side of the heavily loaded boat, swamped the craft,
and were all thrown into the sea, where they were despatched in large numbers, and those who
escaped to the land were destroyed "by the Kintail men, who killed them like sealchagan."[A]
The body of young Glengarry was secured and buried in the very door-way of the Kirk of Kintail,
that the Mackenzies might trample over it whenever they went to church. Time passed on, Donald
Gruamach, the old chief, died ere he could mature matters for adequate retaliation of the Kyle
tragedy and the loss of his son Angus. The chief of the clan was an infant in whom the feelings
of revenge could not be worked out by action; but there was one, his cousin, who was the Captain
or Leader in whom the bitterest thoughts exercised their fullest sway. It seems now impossible
that such acts could have occurred, and it gives one a startling idea of the state of the country
then, when such a terrible instance of private vengeance could have been carried out so recent
as the beginning of the seventeenth century, without any notice being taken of it, even, in
those days of general blood and rapine. Notwithstanding the hideousness of sacrilege and murder,
which, certainly, in magnitude of atrocity, was scarcely ever equalled, there are many living,
even in the immediate neighbourhood, who are ignorant of the cause of the act. Macranuil of
Lundi, captain of the clan, whose personal prowess was only equalled by his intense ferocity,
made many incursions into the Mackenzie country, sweeping away their cattle, and otherwise
doing them serious injury; but these were but preludes to that sanguinary act on which his
soul gloated, and by which he hoped effectually to avenge the loss of influence and property
of which his clan were deprived by the Mackenzies, and more particularly wash out the records
of death of his chief and clansmen at Kyleakin. In order to form his plans more effectually
he wandered for some time as a mendicant among the Mackenzies in order the more successfully
to fix on the best means and spot for his revenge. A solitary life offered up to expiate the
manes of his relatives was not sufficient in his estimation, but the life's blood of such a
number of his bitterest foemen, and an act at which the country should stand aghast was absolutely
necessary. Returning home he gathered together a number of the most desperate of his clan,
and by a forced march across the hills arrived at the Church of Cilliechriost on a Sunday forenoon,
when it was filled by a crowd of worshippers of the clan Mackenzie. Without a moments delay,
without a single pang of remorse, and while the song of praise ascended to heaven from fathers,
mothers, and children, he surrounded the church with his band, and with lighted torches set
fire to the roof. The building was thatched, and while a gentle breeze from the east fanned
the fire, the song of praise, mingled with the crackling of the flames, until the imprisoned
congregation, becoming conscious of their situation, rushed to the doors and windows, where
they were met by a double row of bristling swords. Now, indeed, arose the wild wail of despair,
the shrieks of women, the infuriated cries of men, and the helpless screaming of children,
these mingled with the roaring of the flames appalled even the Macdonalds, but not so Allan
Dubh. "Thrust them back into the flames" cried he, "for he that suffers ought to escape alive
from Cilliechriost shall be branded as a traitor to his clan"; and they were thrust back or
mercilessly hewn down within the narrow porch, until the dead bodies piled on each other opposed
an unsurmountable barrier to the living. Anxious for the preservation of their young children,
the scorching mothers threw them from the windows in the vain hope that the feelings of parents
awakened in the breasts of the Macdonalds would induce them to spare them, but not so. At the
command of Allan of Lundi they were received on the points of the broadswords of men in whose
breasts mercy had no place. It was a wild and fearful sight only witnessed by a wild and fearful
race. During the tragedy they listened with delight to the piper of the band, who marching
round the burning pile, played to drown the screams of the victims, an extempore pibroch, which
has ever since been distinguished as the war tune of Glengarry under the title of "Cilliechriost."
The flaming roof fell upon the burning victims, soon the screams ceased to be heard, a column
of smoke and flame leapt into the air, the pibroch ceased, the last smothered groan of existence
ascended into the still sky of that Sabbath morning, whispering as it died away that the agonies
of the congregation were over.

East, west, north, and south looked Allan Dubh Macranuil. Not a living soul met his eye. The
fire he kindled had destroyed, like the spirit of desolation. Not a sound met his ear, and
his own tiger soul sunk within him in dismay. The Parish of Cilliechriost seemed swept of every
living thing. The fearful silence that prevailed, in a quarter lately so thickly peopled, struck
his followers with dread; for they had given in one hour the inhabitants of a whole parish,
one terrible grave. The desert which they had created filled them with dismay, heightened into
terror by the howls of the masterless sheep dogs, and they turned to fly. Worn out with the
suddenness of their long march from Glengarry, and with their late fiendish exertions, on their
return they sat down to rest on the green face of Glenconvinth, which route they took in order
to reach Lundi through the centre of Glenmorriston by Urquhart. Before they fled from Cilliechriost
Allan divided his party into two, one passing by Inverness and the other as already mentioned;
but the Macdonalds were not allowed to escape, for the flames had roused the Mackenzies as
effectually as if the fiery cross had been sent through their territories. A youthful leader,
a cadet of the family of Seaforth, in an incredibly short time, found himself surrounded by
a determined band of Mackenzies eager for the fray; these were also divided into two bodies,
one commanded by Murdoch Mackenzie of Redcastle, proceeded by Inverness, to follow the pursuit
along the southern side of Loch Ness; another headed by Alexander Mackenzie of Coul, struck
across the country from Beauly, to follow the party of the Macdonalds who fled along the northern
side of Loch Ness under their leader Allan Dubh Macranuil. The party that fled by Inverness
were surprised by Redcastle in a public-house at Torbreck, three miles to the west of the town
where they stopped to refresh themselves. The house was set on fire, and they all--thirty-seven
in number--suffered the death which, in the earlier part of the day, they had so wantonly inflicted.
The Mackenzies, under Coul, after a few hours' hard running, came up with the Macdonalds as
they sought a brief repose on the hills towards the burn of Aultsigh. There the Macdonalds
maintained an unequal conflict, but as guilt only brings faint hearts to its unfortunate votaries
they turned and again fled precipitately to the burn. Many, however, missed the ford, and the
channel being rough and rocky several fell under the swords of the victorious Mackenzies. The
remainder, with all the speed they could make, held on for miles lighted by a splendid and
cloudless moon, and when the rays of the morning burst upon them, Allan Dubh Macranuil and
his party were seen ascending the southern ridge of Glen Urquhart with the Mackenzies close
in the rear. Allan casting an eye behind him and observing the superior numbers and determination
of his pursuers, called to his band to disperse in order to confuse his pursuers and so divert
the chase from himself. This being done, he again set forward at the height of his speed, and
after a long run, drew breath to reconnoitre, when, to his dismay, he found that the avenging
Mackenzies were still upon his track in one unbroken mass. Again he divided his men and bent
his flight towards the shore of Loch Ness, but still he saw the foe with redoubled vigour,
bearing down upon him. Becoming fearfully alive to his position, he cried to his few remaining
companions again to disperse, until they left him, one by one, and he was alone. Allan, who
as a mark of superiority and as Captain of the Glengarry Macdonalds, always wore a red jacket,
was easily distinguished from the rest of his clansmen, and the Mackenzies being anxious for
his capture, thus easily singled him out as the object of their joint and undiverted pursuit.
Perceiving the sword of vengeance ready to descend on his head he took a resolution as desperate
in its conception as unequalled in its accomplishment. Taking a short course towards the fearful
ravine of Aultsigh he divested himself of his plaid and buckler, and turning to the leader
of the Mackenzies, who had nearly come up with him, beckoned him to follow, then with a few
yards of a run he sprang over the yawning chasm, never before contemplated without a shudder.
The agitation of his mind at the moment completely overshadowed the danger of the attempt,
and being of an athletic frame he succeeded in clearing the desperate leap. The young and reckless
Mackenzie, full of ardour and determined at all hazards to capture the murderer followed; but,
being a stranger to the real width of the chasm, perhaps of less nerve than his adversary,
and certainly not stimulated by the same feelings, he only touched the opposite brink with
his toes, and slipping downwards he clung by a slender shoot of hazel which grew over the tremendous
abyss. Allan Dubh looking round on his pursuer and observing the agitation of the hazel bush,
immediately guessed the cause, and returning with the ferocity of a demon who had succeeded
in getting his victim into his fangs, hoarsely whispered, "I have given your race this day
much, I shall give them this also, surely now the debt is paid," when cutting the hazel twig
with his sword, the intrepid youth was dashed from crag to crag until he reached the stream
below, a bloody and misshapen mass. Macranuil again commenced his flight, but one of the Mackenzies,
who by this time had come up, sent a musket shot after him, by which he was wounded, and obliged
to slacken his pace. None of his pursuers, however, on coming up to Aultsigh, dared or dreamt
of taking a leap which had been so fatal to their youthful leader, and were therefore under
the necessity of taking a circuitous route to gain the other side. This circumstance enabled
Macranuil to increase the distance between him and his pursuers, but the loss of blood, occasioned
by his wound, so weakened him that very soon he found his determined enemies were fast gaining
on him. Like an infuriated wolf he hesitated whether to await the undivided attack of the Mackenzies
or plunge into Loch Ness and attempt to swim across its waters. The shouts of his approaching
enemies soon decided him, and he sprung into its deep and dark wave. Refreshed by its invigorating
coolness he soon swam beyond the reach of their muskets; but in his weak and wounded state
it is more than probable he would have sunk ere he had crossed half the breadth had not the
firing and the shouts of his enemies proved the means of saving his life. Fraser of Foyers
seeing a numerous band of armed men standing on the opposite bank of Loch Ness, and observing
a single swimmer struggling in the water, ordered his boat to be launched, and pulling hard
to the individual, discovered him to be his friend Allan Dubh, with whose family Fraser was
on terms of friendship. Macranuil, thus rescued remained at the house of Foyers until he was
cured of his wound, but the influence and the Clan of the Macdonalds henceforth declined, while
that of the Mackenzies surely and steadily increased.

The heavy ridge between the vale of Urquhart and Aultsigh where Allan Dubh Macranuil so often
divided his men, is to this day called Monadh-a-leumanaich or "the Moor of the Leaper."

CAN THIS BE THE LAND?

          "How are the mighty fallen!"

    Can this be the land where of old heroes flourished?
    Can this be the land of the sons of the blast?
    Gloom-wrapt as a monarch whose greatness hath perished,
    Its beauty of loneliness speaks of the past:--
    Tell me ye green valleys, dark glens, and blue mountains,
    Where now are the mighty that round ye did dwell?
    Ye wild-sweeping torrents, and woe-sounding fountains,
    Say, is it their spirits that wail in your swell?

    Oft, oft have ye leaped when your children of battle,
    With war-bearing footsteps rushed down your dark crests;
    Oft, oft have ye thundered with far-rolling rattle,
    The echoes of slogans that burst from their breasts:--
    Wild music of cataracts peals in their gladness,--
    Hoarse tempests still shriek to the clouds lightning-fired,--
    Dark shadows of glory departed, in sadness
    Still linger o'er ruins where dwelt the inspired.

    The voice of the silence for ever is breaking
    Around the lone heaths of the glory-sung braves;
    Dim ghosts haunt in sorrow, a land all forsaken,
    And pour their mist tears o'er the heather-swept graves:--
    Can this be the land of the thunder-toned numbers
    That snowy bards sung in the fire of their bloom?
    Deserted and blasted, in death's silent slumbers,
    It glooms o'er my soul like the wreck of a tomb.

HIGHLAND FOLK-LORE.

BY "NETHER-LOCHABER."

FOLK-LORE--a word of recent importation from the German--is a big word, and Highland Folk-Lore
is a big subject, so big and comprehensive that not one Magazine article, but a many-chaptered
series of Magazine articles would be necessary ere one could aver that he had done his "text"
anything like justice. On the present occasion, therefore, we do not pretend to enter into
the heart of a subject so extensive and many-sided: we shall content ourselves with a little
scouting and skirmishing, so to speak, along the borders of a territory which it is possible
we may ask the readers at some future time to explore along with us more at large. A few of
the many proverbs, wisdom words, and moral and prudential sentences in daily use shall, in
clerical phrase, meantime form "the subject-matter of our discourse." Nor must the reader think
that the subject is in any wise infra dignitate, unworthy, that is, or undignified. Of the
world-renowned Seven Wise Men of Greece, five at least attained to all their eminence and fame
no otherwise than because they were the cunning framers of maxims and proverbs that rightly
interpreted were calculated to advance and consolidate the moral and material welfare of the
nation around them. Of the remaining two, it is true that one was an eminent politician and
legislator, and the other a natural philosopher of the first order; but it is questionable
if either of them would have been considered entitled to their prominent place in the Grecian
Pleiades of Wise Men had they not been proverb-makers and utterers of brief but pregnant "wisdom-words"
as well. So much then for the dignity of our subject: what engaged the attention of Solomon
and the Seven Sages of Greece cannot surely be unworthy some small share of our regard.

"Six and half-a-dozen" is an English phrase, implying either that two things are exactly the
same, or so very much alike as to be practically the same. The old Gael was not much of an
arithmetician, he rarely meddled with numbers, and therefore no precisely similar phrase is
to be found in his language; but he could express the same idea in his own way, and so pithily
and emphatically that his version of the proverbial axiom is, perhaps, as good as is to be
found in any other language whatever. The Gael's equivalent for "six and half-a-dozen" is,
"Bo mhaol odhar, agus bo odhar, mhaol"--(A cow that is doddled and dun, and a cow that is dun
and doddled)--a phrase drawn, as are many of his most striking proverbs and prudential maxims,
and very naturally too, from his pastoral surroundings. We recollect an admirable and very
ludicrous application of this saying in a story once told us by the late Dr Norman Macleod
of Glasgow, "old" Norman that is, not the Barony Doctor, but his father:--When a boy in Morven,
of which parish his father was minister, there was a well-known character in that part of the
country called "Eoghann Gorach Chraigan Uibhir," Daft Ewen of Craig-an-Ure in Mull, a born
"natural," who, although a veritable "fool," had yet in him much of the quiet, keen-edged satire
and roguery which is not unfrequently found in the better ranks of such "silly ones." Ewen
regularly perambulated Mull and Morven, with an occasional raid into the neighbouring districts
of Sunart and Ardnamurchan. He had sense enough to be able to carry the current news of the
day from district to district, and on this account was always a welcome guest in every farm-house
and hamlet on his beat; and as he sung a capital song, and was remarkable for much harmless
drollery and "dafting," he was, it is needless to say, a great favourite everywhere. He took
a great interest in ecclesiastical affairs, and always attended the church when the state of
his wardrobe and other circumstances permitted. On one occasion Ewen was passing through Morven,
and knowing that the annual communion time was approaching, he called upon the minister and
begged to know who his assistants on that particular occasion were to be. He was going to pay
a visit, he said, to all the glens and outlying hamlets in the parish, and as the people were
sure to ask him the important question, he wished to have the proper answer direct from the
minister himself. "Tha raghadh 'us taghadh nam ministeiran, Eoghainn; An Doiteir A. B. a Inneraora,
agus an Doiteir C. D. a Muille." (The pick and choice of ministers Ewen said the minister,
Doctor A. B. from Inverary, and Doctor C. D. from Mull). "Whe-e-we!" in a contemptuously prolonged
low whistle replied Ewen. "An ann mar so a tha; Bo mhaol, odhar, agus bo odhar, mhaol!" (And
is it even so; are these to be your assistants? A cow that is doddled and dun, and a cow that
is dun and doddled!) Than which nothing could more emphatically convey Ewen's very small opinion
of the "assistants" mentioned. They were much of a muchness; six and half-a-dozen; a cow doddled
and dun, and a cow dun and doddled! The Gael was a keen observer of natural phenomena, and
some of his best sayings were founded on the knowledge thus acquired. Meteorological "wisdom-words"
for instance, are quite common. "Mar chloich a ruith le gleann, tha feasgar fann foghairidh"
is an admirable example. (As is the headlong rush of a stone, atumbling down the glen, so hurried
and of short duration is an autumnal afternoon.) The philosophy of the saying is that you are
to begin your work betimes in the season of autumn; at early dawn if possible, and not to stop
at all for dinner, seeing that once the day has passed its prime, the hour of sunset approaches
with giant strides, and there is little or no twilight to help you if you have been foolish
enough to dawdle your time in the hours of sunset proper. "'S fas a ch羅il as nach goirear"
is another pregnant adage. (Desert, indeed, is the corner whence no voice of bird is heard.)
Some people are very quiet, almost dumb indeed, but on the occurrence of some event, or on
the back of some remark of yours, they speak, and speak so clearly and well that you are surprised,
and quote the saying that it is a solitary and silent glade indeed whence no voice is heard.
"Am fear a bhios na thamh, saoilidh e gur i lamh fhein as fhearr air an sti羅ir" is a common
saying of much meaning and wide application. (He that is idle [a mere spectator] thinks that
he could steer the boat better than the man actually in charge.) And we all know how apt we
are to meddle, and generally unwisely, with the proper labours of others. Nothing, for instance,
is more annoying and dangerous even than to put forth your hand by way of helping a driver
in managing his horses, or to interfere with the tiller of a boat at which a perfectly competent
man is already seated. We have known the saying just quoted scores of times suffice to stop
the unwise and gratuitous intermeddling of such as were disposed to interfere with what did
not properly belong to them. "Bidh fear an aon mhairt aig uairean gun bhainne" is a frequent
saying, and implies more than is at first sight apparent. (The man with only one cow will be
at times without milk.) The import of the saying is something more than a mere statement of
fact. You have only one cow, and you are certain to be at times without milk. Get by your industry
and perseverance two cows or three, and then you are pretty sure to have more or less milk
all the year round.

We have thus briefly touched the hem, so to speak, of a very interesting subject--a subject
that in the Highlands of Scotland, at least, has never yet received a tittle of the attention
it deserves. And let no one be afraid to meddle with it to any extent he pleases, for we promise
him that he will meet with nothing in any way to shock his delicacy or offend his taste, no
matter how fine so ever of edge and exquisite; and in this respect, at all events, the good
old Gael is superior to that of any other people of whom we have any knowledge. We may, perhaps,
deal more at large with the subject in a future number. Meantime, we may state that we are
of the same opinion as the Editor of the Inverness Courier; there is abundance of room for
the Celtic Magazine if it continues to be well conducted, without, in the least degree, encroaching
upon the territories of any other periodicals interested in Celtic affairs.
