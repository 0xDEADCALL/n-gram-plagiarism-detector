MY GARDEN ACQUAINTANCE

By James Russell Lowell

ONE of the most delightful books in my father's library was White's "Natural History of Selborne."
For me it has rather gained in charm with years. I used to read it without knowing the secret
of the pleasure I found in it, but as I grow older I begin to detect some of the simple expedients
of this natural magic. Open the book where you will, it takes you out of doors. In our broiling
July weather one can walk out with this genially garrulous Fellow of Oriel and find refreshment
instead of fatigue. You have no trouble in keeping abreast of him as he ambles along on his
hobby-horse, now pointing to a pretty view, now stopping to watch the motions of a bird or
an insect, or to bag a specimen for the Honorable Daines Barrington or Mr. Pennant. In simplicity
of taste and natural refinement he reminds one of Walton; in tenderness toward what he would
have called the brute creation, of Cowper. I do not know whether his descriptions of scenery
are good or not, but they have made me familiar with his neighborhood. Since I first read him,
I have walked over some of his favorite haunts, but I still see them through his eyes rather
than by any recollection of actual and personal vision. The book has also the delightfulness
of absolute leisure. Mr. White seems never to have had any harder work to do than to study
the habits of his feathered fellow-townsfolk, or to watch the ripening of his peaches on the
wall. His volumes are the journal of Adam in Paradise,

   "Annihilating all that's made
    To a green thought in a green shade."

It is positive rest only to look into that garden of his. It is vastly better than to

             "See great Diocletian walk
   In the Salonian garden's noble shade,"

for thither ambassadors intrude to bring with them the noises of Rome, while here the world
has no entrance. No rumor of the revolt of the American Colonies seems to have reached him.
"The natural term of an hog's life" has more interest for him than that of an empire. Burgoyne
may surrender and welcome; of what consequence is that compared with the fact that we can explain
the odd tumbling of rooks in the air by their turning over "to scratch themselves with one
claw"? All the couriers in Europe spurring rowel-deep make no stir in Mr. White's little Chartreuse;(1)
but the arrival of the house-martin a day earlier or later than last year is a piece of news
worth sending express to all his correspondents.

(1) La Grande Chartreuse was the original Carthusian monastery in France, where the most austere
privacy was maintained.

Another secret charm of this book is its inadvertent humor, so much the more delicious because
unsuspected by the author. How pleasant is his innocent vanity in adding to the list of the
British, and still more of the Selbornian, fauna! I believe he would gladly have consented
to be eaten by a tiger or a crocodile, if by that means the occasional presence within the
parish limits of either of these anthropophagous brutes could have been established. He brags
of no fine society, but is plainly a little elated by "having considerable acquaintance with
a tame brown owl." Most of us have known our share of owls, but few can boast of intimacy with
a feathered one. The great events of Mr. White's life, too, have that disproportionate importance
which is always humorous. To think of his hands having actually been though worthy (as neither
Willoughby's nor Ray's were) to hold a stilted plover, the Charadrius himaniopus, with no back
toe, and therefore "liable, in speculation, to perpetual vacillations"! I wonder, by the way,
if metaphysicians have no hind toes. In 1770 he makes the acquaintance in Sussex of "an old
family tortoise," which had then been domesticated for thirty years. It is clear that he fell
in love with it at first sight. We have no means of tracing the growth of his passion; but
in 1780 we find him eloping with its object in a post-chaise. It reads like a Court Journal:
"Yesterday morning H.R.H. the Princess Alice took an airing of half an hour on the terrace
of Windsor Castle." This tortoise might have been a member of the Royal Society, if he could
have condescended to so ignoble an ambition. It had but just been discovered that a surface
inclined at a certain angle with the plane of the horizon took more of the sun's rays. The
tortoise had always known this (though he unostentatiously made no parade of it), and used
accordingly to tilt himself up against the garden-wall in the autumn. He seems to have been
more of a philosopher than even Mr. White himself, caring for nothing but to get under a cabbage-leaf
when it rained, or the sun was too hot, and to bury himself alive before frost,--a four-footed
Diogenes, who carried his tub on his back.

There are moods in which this kind of history is infinitely refreshing. These creatures whom
we affect to look down upon as the drudges of instinct are members of a commonwealth whose
constitution rests on immovable bases, never any need of reconstruction there! They never dream
of settling it by vote that eight hours are equal to ten, or that one creature is as clever
as another and no more. They do not use their poor wits in regulating God's clocks, nor think
they cannot go astray so long as they carry their guide-board about with them,--a delusion
we often practise upon ourselves with our high and mighty reason, that admirable finger-post
which points every way and always right. It is good for us now and then to converse with a
world like Mr. White's, where Man is the least important of animals. But one who, like me,
has always lived in the country and always on the same spot, is drawn to his book by other
occult sympathies. Do we not share his indignation at that stupid Martin who had graduated
his thermometer no lower than 4o above zero of Fahrenheit, so that in the coldest weather ever
known the mercury basely absconded into the bulb, and left us to see the victory slip through
our fingers, just as they were closing upon it? No man, I suspect, ever lived long in the country
without being bitten by these meteorological ambitions. He likes to be hotter and colder, to
have been more deeply snowed up, to have more trees and larger blow down than his neighbors.
With us descendants of the Puritans especially, these weather-competitions supply the abnegated
excitement of the race-course. Men learn to value thermometers of the true imaginative temperament,
capable of prodigious elations and corresponding dejections. The other day (5th July) I marked
98o in the shade, my high water mark, higher by one degree than I had ever seen it before.
I happened to meet a neighbor; as we mopped our brows at each other, he told me that he had
just cleared 100o, and I went home a beaten man. I had not felt the heat before, save as a
beautiful exaggeration of sunshine; but now it oppressed me with the prosaic vulgarity of an
oven. What had been poetic intensity became all at once rhetorical hyperbole. I might suspect
his thermometer (as indeed I did, for we Harvard men are apt to think ill of any graduation
but our own); but it was a poor consolation. The fact remained that his herald Mercury, standing
a tiptoe, could look down on mine. I seem to glimpse something of this familiar weakness in
Mr. White. He, too, has shared in these mercurial triumphs and defeats. Nor do I doubt that
he had a true country-gentleman's interest in the weather-cock; that his first question on
coming down of a morning was, like Barabas's,

   "Into what quarter peers my halcyon's bill?"

It is an innocent and healthful employment of the mind, distracting one from too continual
study of himself, and leading him to dwell rather upon the indigestions of the elements than
his own. "Did the wind back round, or go about with the sun?" is a rational question that bears
not remotely on the making of hay and the prosperity of crops. I have little doubt that the
regulated observation of the vane in many different places, and the interchange of results
by telegraph, would put the weather, as it were, in our power, by betraying its ambushes before
it is ready to give the assault. At first sight, nothing seems more drolly trivial than the
lives of those whose single achievement is to record the wind and the temperature three times
a day. Yet such men are doubtless sent into the world for this special end, and perhaps there
is no kind of accurate observation, whatever its object, that has not its final use and value
for some one or other. It is even to be hoped that the speculations of our newspaper editors
and their myriad correspondence upon the signs of the political atmosphere may also fill their
appointed place in a well-regulated universe, if it be only that of supplying so many more
jack-o'-lanterns to the future historian. Nay, the observations on finance of an M.C. whose
sole knowledge of the subject has been derived from a life-long success in getting a living
out of the public without paying any equivalent therefor, will perhaps be of interest hereafter
to some explorer of our cloaca maxima, whenever it is cleansed.

For many years I have been in the habit of noting down some of the leading events of my embowered
solitude, such as the coming of certain birds and the like,--a kind of memoires pour servir,
after the fashion of White, rather than properly digested natural history. I thought it not
impossible that a few simple stories of my winged acquaintances might be found entertaining
by persons of kindred taste.

There is a common notion that animals are better meteorologists than men, and I have little
doubt that in immediate weather-wisdom they have the advantage of our sophisticated senses
(though I suspect a sailor or shepherd would be their match), but I have seen nothing that
leads me to believe their minds capable of erecting the horoscope of a whole season, and letting
us know beforehand whether the winter will be severe or the summer rainless. I more than suspect
that the clerk of the weather himself does not always know very long in advance whether he
is to draw an order for hot or cold, dry or moist, and the musquash is scarce likely to be
wiser. I have noted but two days' difference in the coming of the song-sparrow between a very
early and a very backward spring. This very year I saw the linnets at work thatching, just
before a snow-storm which covered the ground several inches deep for a number of days. They
struck work and left us for a while, no doubt in search of food. Birds frequently perish from
sudden changes in our whimsical spring weather of which they had no foreboding. More than thirty
years ago, a cherry-tree, then in full bloom, near my window, was covered with humming-birds
benumbed by a fall of mingled rain and snow, which probably killed many of them. It should
seem that their coming was dated by the height of the sun, which betrays them into unthrifty
matrimony;

   "So priketh hem Nature in hir corages;"(1)

but their going is another matter. The chimney swallows leave us early, for example, apparently
so soon as their latest fledglings are firm enough of wing to attempt the long rowing-match
that is before them. On the other hand the wild-geese probably do not leave the North till
they are frozen out, for I have heard their bugles sounding southward so late as the middle
of December. What may be called local migrations are doubtless dictated by the chances of food.
I have once been visited by large flights of cross-bills; and whenever the snow lies long and
deep on the ground, a flock of cedar-birds comes in mid-winter to eat the berries on my hawthorns.
I have never been quite able to fathom the local, or rather geographical partialities of birds.
Never before this summer (1870) have the king-birds, handsomest of flycatchers, built in my
orchard; though I always know where to find them within half a mile. The rose-breasted grosbeak
has been a familiar bird in Brookline (three miles away), yet I never saw one here till last
July, when I found a female busy among my raspberries and surprisingly bold. I hope she was
prospecting with a view to settlement in our garden. She seemed, on the whole, to think well
of my fruit, and I would gladly plant another bed if it would help to win over so delightful
a neighbor.

                    The Titmouse, lines 75, 76. J.R.L.

For his cousin, the catbird, I have a still warmer regard.  Always a good singer, he sometimes
nearly equals the brown thrush, and has the merit of keeping up his music later in the evening
than any bird of my familiar acquaintance. Ever since I can remember, a pair of them have built
in a gigantic syringa near our front door, and I have known the male to sing almost uninterruptedly
during the evenings of early summer till twilight duskened into dark. They differ greatly in
vocal talent, but all have a delightful way of crooning over, and, as it were, rehearsing their
song in an undertone, which makes their nearness always unobtrusive. Though there is the most
trustworthy witness to the imitative propensity of this bird, I have only once, during an intimacy
of more than forty years, heard him indulge it. In that case, the imitation was by no means
so close as to deceive, but a free reproduction of the notes of some other birds, especially
of the oriole, as a kind of variation in his own song. The catbird is as shy as the robin is
vulgarly familiar. Only when his nest or his fledglings are approached does he become noisy
and almost aggressive. I have known him to station his young in a thick cornel-bush on the
edge of the raspberry-bed, after the fruit began to ripen, and feed them there for a week or
more. In such cases he shows none of that conscious guilt which makes the robin contemptible.
On the contrary, he will maintain his post in the thicket, and sharply scold the intruder who
ventures to steal his berries. After all, his claim is only for tithes, while the robin will
bag your entire crop if he get a chance.

Dr. Watts's statement that "birds in their little nests agree," like too many others intended
to form the infant mind, is very far from being true. On the contrary, the most peaceful relation
of the different species to each other is that of armed neutrality. They are very jealous of
neighbors. A few years ago I was much interested in the housebuilding of a pair of summer yellow-birds.
They had chosen a very pretty site near the top of a tall white lilac, within easy eye-shot
of a chamber window. A very pleasant thing it was to see their little home growing with mutual
help, to watch their industrious skill interrupted only by little flirts and snatches of endearment,
frugally cut short by the common-sense of the tiny house-wife. They had brought their work
nearly to an end, and had already begun to line it with fern-down, the gathering of which demanded
more distant journeys and longer absences. But, alas! the syringa, immemorial manor of the
catbirds, was not more than twenty feet away, and these "giddy neighbors" had, as it appeared,
been all along jealously watchful, though silent, witnesses of what they deemed an intrusion
of squatters. No sooner were the pretty mates fairly gone for a new load of lining, than

   "To their unguarded nest these weasel Scots
     Came stealing."(1)

Silently they flew back and forth, each giving a vengeful dab at the nest in passing. They
did not fall-to and deliberately destroy it, for they might have been caught at their mischief.
As it was, whenever the yellow-birds came back, their enemies were hidden in their own sight-proof
bush. Several times their unconscious victims repaired damages, but at length, after counsel
taken together, they gave it up. Perhaps, like other unlettered folk, they came to the conclusion
that the Devil was in it, and yielded to the invisible persecution of witchcraft.

The robins, by constant attacks and annoyances, have succeeded in driving off the blue-jays
who used to build in our pines, their gay colors and quaint, noisy ways making them welcome
and amusing neighbors. I once had the chance of doing a kindness to a household of them, which
they received with very friendly condescension. I had had my eye for some time upon a nest,
and was puzzled by a constant fluttering of what seemed full-grown wings in it whenever I drew
nigh. At last I climbed the tree, in spite of angry protests from the old birds against my
intrusion. The mystery had a very simple solution. In building the nest, a long piece of packthread
had been somewhat loosely woven in. Three of the young had contrived to entangle themselves
in it, and had become full-grown without being able to launch themselves upon the air. One
was unharmed; another had so tightly twisted the cord about its shank that one foot was curled
up and seemed paralyzed; the third, in its struggles to escape, had sawn through the flesh
of the thigh and so much harmed itself that I thought it humane to put an end to its misery.
When I took out my knife to cut their hempen bonds, the heads of the family seemed to divine
my friendly intent. Suddenly ceasing their cries and threats. they perched quietly within reach
of my hand, and watched me in my work of manumission. This, owing to the fluttering terror
of the prisoners, was an affair of some delicacy; but ere long I was rewarded by seeing one
of them fly away to a neighboring tree, while the cripple, making a parachute of his wings,
came lightly to the ground, and hopped off as well as he could with one leg, obsequiously waited
on by his elders. A week later I had the satisfaction of meeting him in the pine-walk, in good
spirits, and already so far recovered as to be able to balance himself with the lame foot.
I have no doubt that in his old age he accounted for his lameness by some handsome story of
a wound received at the famous Battle of the Pines, when our tribe, overcome by numbers, was
driven from its ancient camping-ground. Of late years the jays have visited us only at intervals;
and in winter their bright plumage, set off by the snow, and their cheerful cry, are especially
welcome. They would have furnished Aesop with a fable, for the feathered crest in which they
seem to take so much satisfaction is often their fatal snare. Country boys make a hole with
their finger in the snow-crust just large enough to admit the jay's head, and, hollowing it
out somewhat beneath, bait it with a few kernels of corn. The crest slips easily into the trap,
but refuses to be pulled out again, and he who came to feast remains a prey.

Twice have the crow-blackbirds attempted a settlement in my pines, and twice have the robins,
who claim a right of preemption, so successfully played the part of border-ruffians as to drive
them away,--to my great regret, for they are the best substitute we have for rooks. At Shady
Hill(1) (now, alas! empty of its so long-loved household) they build by hundreds, and nothing
can be more cheery than their creaking clatter (like a convention of old-fashioned tavern-signs)
as they gather at evening to debate in mass meeting their windy politics, or to gossip at their
tent-doors over the events of the day. Their port is grave, and their stalk across the turf
as martial as that of a second-rate ghost in Hamlet. They never meddled with my corn, so far
as I could discover.

For a few years I had crows, but their nests are an irresistible bait for boys, and their settlement
was broken up. They grew so wonted as to throw off a great part of their shyness, and to tolerate
my near approach. One very hot day I stood for some time within twenty feet of a mother and
three children, who sat on an elm bough over my head gasping in the sultry air, and holding
their wings half-spread for coolness. All birds during the pairing season become more or less
sentimental, and murmur soft nothings in a tone very unlike the grinding-organ repetition and
loudness of their habitual song. Yet there are few things to my ear more melodious than his
caw of a clear winter morning as it drops to you filtered through five hundred fathoms of crisp
blue air. The hostility of all smaller birds makes the moral character of the row, for all
his deaconlike demeanor and garb, somewhat questionable. He could never sally forth without
insult. The golden robins, especially, would chase him as far as I could follow with my eye,
making him duck clumsily to avoid their importunate bills. I do not believe, however, that
he robbed any nests hereabouts, for the refuse of the gas-works, which, in our free-and-easy
community, is allowed to poison the river, supplied him with dead alewives in abundance. I
used to watch him making his periodical visits to the salt-marshes and coming back with a fish
in his beak to his young savages, who, no doubt, like it in that condition which makes it savory
to the Kanakas and other corvine races of men.

Orioles are in great plenty with me.  I have seen seven males flashing about the garden at
once. A merry crew of them swing their hammocks from the pendulous boughs. During one of these
later years, when the canker-worms stripped our elms as bare as winter, these birds went to
the trouble of rebuilding their unroofed nests, and chose for the purpose trees which are safe
from those swarming vandals, such as the ash and the button-wood. One year a pair (disturbed,
I suppose, elsewhere) built a second next in an elm within a few yards of the house. My friend,
Edward E. Hale, told me once that the oriole rejected from his web all strands of brilliant
color, and I thought it a striking example of that instinct of concealment noticeable in many
birds, though it should seem in this instance that the nest was amply protected by its position
from all marauders but owls and squirrels. Last year, however, I had the fullest proof that
Mr. Hale was mistaken. A pair of orioles built on the lowest trailer of a weeping elm, which
hung within ten feet of our drawing-room window, and so low that I could reach it from the
ground. The nest was wholly woven and felted with ravellings of woollen carpet in which scarlet
predominated. Would the same thing have happened in the woods? Or did the nearness of a human
dwelling perhaps give the birds a greater feeling of security? They are very bold, by the way,
in quest of cordage, and I have often watched them stripping the fibrous bark from a honeysuckle
growing over the very door. But, indeed, all my birds look upon me as if I were a mere tenant
at will, and they were landlords. With shame I confess it, I have been bullied even by a hummingbird.
This spring, as I was cleansing a pear-tree of its lichens, one of these little zigzagging
blurs came purring toward me, couching his long bill like a lance, his throat sparkling with
angry fire, to warn me off from a Missouri-currant whose honey he was sipping. And many a time
he has driven me out of a flower-bed. This summer, by the way, a pair of these winged emeralds
fastened their mossy acorn-cup upon a bough of the same elm which the orioles had enlivened
the year before. We watched all their proceedings from the window through an opera-glass, and
saw their two nestlings grow from black needles with a tuft of down at the lower end, till
they whirled away on their first short experimental flights. They became strong of wing in
a surprisingly short time, and I never saw them or the male bird after, though the female was
regular as usual in her visits to our petunias and verbenas. I do not think it ground enough
for a generalization, but in the many times when I watched the old birds feeding their young,
the mother always alighted, while the father as uniformly remained upon the wing.

The bobolinks are generally chance visitors, tinkling through the garden in blossoming-time,
but this year, owing to the long rains early in the season, their favorite meadows were flooded,
and they were driven to the upland. So I had a pair of them domiciled in my grass field. The
male used to perch in an apple-tree, then in full bloom, and, while I stood perfectly still
close by, he would circle away, quivering round the entire field of five acres, with no break
in his song, and settle down again among the blooms, to be hurried away almost immediately
by a new rapture of music. He had the volubility of an Italian charlatan at a fair, and, like
him, appeared to be proclaiming the merits of some quack remedy. Opodeldoc-opodeldoc-try-Doctor-Lincoln's-opodeldoc!
he seemed to repeat over and over again, with a rapidity that would have distanced the deftest-tongued
Figaro that ever rattled. I remember Count Gurowski saying once, with that easy superiority
of knowledge about this country which is the monopoly of foreigners, that we had no singing-birds!
Well, well, Mr. Hepworth Dixon(1) has found the typical America in Oneida and Salt Lake City.
Of course, an intelligent European is the best judge of these matters. The truth is there are
more singing-birds in Europe because there are fewer forests. These songsters love the neighborhood
of man because hawks and owls are rarer, while their own food is more abundant. Most people
seem to think, the more trees, the more birds. Even Chateaubriand, who first tried the primitive-forest-cure,
and whose description of the wilderness in its imaginative effects is unmatched, fancies the
"people of the air singing their hymns to him." So far as my own observation goes, the farther
one penetrates the sombre solitudes of the woods, the more seldom does he hear the voice of
any singing-bird. In spite of Chateaubriand's minuteness of detail, in spite of that marvellous
reverberation of the decrepit tree falling of its own weight, which he was the first to notice,
I cannot help doubting whether he made his way very deep into the wilderness. At any rate,
in a letter to Fontanes, written in 1804, he speaks of mes chevaux paissant a quelque distance.
To be sure Chateaubriand was at to mount the high horse, and this may have been but an afterthought
of the grand seigneur, but certainly one would not make much headway on horseback toward the
druid fastnesses of the primaeval pine.

The bobolinks build in considerable numbers in a meadow within a quarter of a mile of us. A
houseless land passes through the midst of their camp, and in clear westerly weather, at the
right season, one may hear a score of them singing at once. When they are breeding, if I chance
to pass, one of the male birds always accompanies me like a constable, flitting from post to
post of the rail-fence, with a short note of reproof continually repeated, till I am fairly
out of the neighborhood. Then he will swing away into the air and run down the wind, gurgling
music without stint over the unheeding tussocks of meadow-grass and dark clumps of bulrushes
that mark his domain.

We have no bird whose song will match the nightingale's in compass, none whose note is so rich
as that of the European blackbird; but for mere rapture I have never heard the bobolink's rival.
But his opera-season is a short one. The ground and tree sparrows are our most constant performers.
It is now late in August, and one of the latter sings every day and all day long in the garden.
Till within a fortnight, a pair of indigo-birds would keep up their lively duo for an hour
together. While I write, I hear an oriole gay as in June, and the plaintive may-be of the goldfinch
tells me he is stealing my lettuce-seeds. I know not what the experience of others may have
been, but the only bird I have ever hard sing in the night has been the chip-bird. I should
say he sang about as often during the darkness as cocks crow. One can hardly help fancying
that he sings in his dreams.

On second thought, I remember to have heard the cuckoo strike the hours nearly all night with
the regularity of a Swiss clock.

The dead limbs of our elms, which I spare to that end, bring us the flicker every summer, and
almost daily I hear his wild scream and laugh close at hand, himself invisible. He is a shy
bird, but a few days ago I had the satisfaction of studying him through the blinds as he sat
on a tree within a few feet of me. Seen so near and at rest, he makes good his claim to the
title of pigeon-woodpecker. Lumberers have a notion that he is harmful to timber, digging little
holes through the bark to encourage the settlement of insects. The regular rings of such perforations
which one may see in almost any apple-orchard seem to give some probability to this theory.
Almost every season a solitary quail visits us, and, unseen among the currant bushes, alls
Bob White, Bob White, as if he were playing at hide-and-seek with that imaginary being. A rarer
visitant is the turtle-dove, whose pleasant coo (something like the muffled crow of a cock
from a coop covered with snow) I have sometimes heard, and whom I once had the good luck to
see close by me in the mulberry-tree. The wild-pigeon, once numerous, I have not seen for many
years.(1) Of savage birds, a hen-hawk now and then quarters himself upon us for a few days,
sitting sluggish in a tree after a surfeit of poultry. One of them once offered me a near shot
from my study-window one drizzly day for several hours. But it was Sunday, and I gave him the
benefit of its gracious truce of God.

(1) They made their appearance again this summer (1870).--J.R.L.

Certain birds have disappeared from our neighborhood within my memory. I remember when the
whippoorwill could be heard in Sweet Auburn. The night-hawk, once common, is now rare. The
brown thrush has moved farther up country. For years I have not seen or heard any of the larger
owls, whose hooting was once of my boyish terrors. The cliff-swallow, strange emigrant, that
eastward takes his way, has come and gone again in my time. The bank-swallows, wellnigh innumerable
during my boyhood, no longer frequent the crumbly cliff of the gravel-pit by the river. The
barn-swallows, which once swarmed in our barn, flashing through the dusty sun-streak of the
mow, have been gone these many years. My father would lead me out to see them gather on the
roof, and take counsel before their yearly migration, as Mr. White used to see them at Selborne.
Eheu fugaces! Thank fortune, the swift still glues his nest, and rolls his distant thunders
night and day in the wide-throated chimneys, still sprinkles the evening air with his merry
twittering. The populous heronry in Fresh Pond meadows has wellnigh broken up, but still a
pair or two haunt the old home, as the gypsies of Ellangowan their ruined huts, and every evening
fly over us riverwards, clearing their throats with a hoarse hawk as they go, and, in cloudy
weather. scarce higher than the tops of the chimneys. Sometimes I have known one to alight
in one of our trees, though for what purpose I never could divine. Kingfishers have sometimes
puzzled me in the same way, perched at high noon in a pine, springing their watchman's rattle
when they flitted away from my curiosity, and seeming to shove their top-heavy heads along
as a man does a wheelbarrow.

Some birds have left us, I suppose, because the country is growing less wild. I once found
a summer duck's nest within a quarter of a mile of our house, but such a trouvaille would be
impossible now as Kidd's treasure. And yet the mere taming of the neighborhood does not quite
satisfy me as an explanation. Twenty years ago, on my way to bathe in the river, I saw every
day a brace of woodcock, on the miry edge of a spring within a few rods of a house, and constantly
visited by thirsty cows. There was no growth of any kind to conceal them, and yet these ordinarily
shy birds were almost as indifferent to my passing as common poultry would have been. Since
bird-nesting has become scientific, and dignified itself as oology, that, no doubt, is partly
to blame for some of our losses. But some old friends are constant.
