A number following a letter, such as d3, was printed as a

In the course of arranging the following essay, I put many things aside in my thoughts to be
said in the Preface, things which I shall now put aside altogether, and pass by; for when a
book has been advertised a year and a half, it seems best to present it with as little preface
as possible.

Thus much, however, it is necessary for the reader to know, that, when I planned the work,
I had materials by me, collected at different times of sojourn in Venice during the last seventeen
years, which it seemed to me might be arranged with little difficulty, and which I believe
to be of value as illustrating the history of Southern Gothic. Requiring, however, some clearer
assurance respecting certain points of chronology, I went to Venice finally in the autumn of
1849, not doubting but that the dates of the principal edifices of the ancient city were either
ascertained, or ascertainable without extraordinary research. To my consternation, I found
that the Venetian antiquaries were not agreed within a century as to the date of the building
of the façades of the Ducal Palace, and that nothing was known of any other civil edifice of
the early city, except that at some time or other it had been fitted up for somebody's reception,
and been thereupon fresh painted. Every date in question was determinable only by internal
evidence, and it became necessary for me to examine not only every one of the older palaces,
stone by stone, but every fragment throughout the city which afforded any clue to the formation
of its styles. This I did as well as I could, and I believe there will be found, in the following
pages, the only existing account of the details of early Venetian architecture on which dependence
can be placed, as far as it goes. I do not care to point out the deficiencies of other works
on this subject; the reader will find, if he examines them, either that the buildings to which
I shall specially direct his attention have been hitherto undescribed, or else that there are
great discrepancies between previous descriptions and mine: for which discrepancies I may be
permitted to give this single and sufficient reason, that my account of every building is based
on personal examination and measurement of it, and that my taking the pains so to examine what
I had to describe, was a subject of grave surprise to my Italian friends. The work of the Marchese
Selvatico is, however, to be distinguished with respect; it is clear in arrangement, and full
of useful, though vague, information; and I have found cause to adopt, in great measure, its
views of the chronological succession of the edifices of Venice. I shall have cause hereafter
to quarrel with it on other grounds, but not without expression of gratitude for the assistance
it has given me. Fontana's "Fabbriche di Venezia" is also historically valuable, but does not
attempt to give architectural detail. Cicognara, as is now generally known, is so inaccurate
as hardly to deserve mention.

Indeed, it is not easy to be accurate in an account of anything, however simple. Zoologists
often disagree in their descriptions of the curve of a shell, or the plumage of a bird, though
they may lay their specimen on the table, and examine it at their leisure; how much greater
becomes the likelihood of error in the description of things which must be in many parts observed
from a distance, or under unfavorable circumstances of light and shade; and of which many of
the distinctive features have been worn away by time. I believe few people have any idea of
the cost of truth in these things; of the expenditure of time necessary to make sure of the
simplest facts, and of the strange way in which separate observations will sometimes falsify
each other, incapable of reconcilement, owing to some imperceptible inadvertency. I am ashamed
of the number of times in which I have had to say, in the following pages, "I am not sure,"
and I claim for them no authority, as if they were thoroughly sifted from error, even in what
they more confidently state. Only, as far as my time, and strength, and mind served me, I have
endeavored down to the smallest matters, to ascertain and speak the truth.

Nor was the subject without many and most discouraging difficulties, peculiar to itself. As
far as my inquiries have extended, there is not a building in Venice, raised prior to the sixteenth
century, which has not sustained essential change in one or more of its most important features.
By far the greater number present examples of three or four different styles, it may be successive,
it may be accidentally associated; and, in many instances, the restorations or additions have
gradually replaced the entire structure of the ancient fabric, of which nothing but the name
remains, together with a kind of identity, exhibited in the anomalous association of the modernized
portions: the Will of the old building asserted through them all, stubbornly, though vainly,
expressive; superseded by codicils, and falsified by misinterpretation; yet animating what
would otherwise be a mere group of fantastic masque, as embarrassing to the antiquary, as to
the mineralogist, the epigene crystal, formed by materials of one substance modelled on the
perished crystals of another. The church of St. Mark's itself, harmonious as its structure
may at first sight appear, is an epitome of the changes of Venetian architecture from the tenth
to the nineteenth century. Its crypt, and the line of low arches which support the screen,
are apparently the earliest portions; the lower stories of the main fabric are of the eleventh
and twelfth centuries, with later Gothic interpolations; the pinnacles are of the earliest
fully developed Venetian Gothic (fourteenth century); but one of them, that on the projection
at the eastern extremity of the Piazzetta de Leoni, is of far finer, and probably earlier workmanship
than all the rest. The southern range of pinnacles is again inferior to the northern and western,
and visibly of later date. Then the screen, which most writers have described as part of the
original fabric, bears its date inscribed on its architrave, 1394, and with it are associated
a multitude of small screens, balustrades, decorations of the interior building, and probably
the rose window of the south transept. Then come the interpolated traceries of the front and
sides; then the crocketings of the upper arches, extravagances of the incipient Renaissance:
and, finally, the figures which carry the waterspouts on the north side--utterly barbarous
seventeenth or eighteenth century work--connect the whole with the plastered restorations of
the year 1844 and 1845. Most of the palaces in Venice have sustained interpolations hardly
less numerous; and those of the Ducal Palace are so intricate, that a year's labor would probably
be insufficient altogether to disentangle and define them. I therefore gave up all thoughts
of obtaining a perfectly clear chronological view of the early architecture; but the dates
necessary to the main purposes of the book the reader will find well established; and of the
evidence brought forward for those of less importance, he is himself to judge. Doubtful estimates
are never made grounds of argument; and the accuracy of the account of the buildings themselves,
for which alone I pledge myself, is of course entirely independent of them.

In like manner, as the statements briefly made in the chapters on construction involve questions
so difficult and so general, that I cannot hope that every expression referring to them will
be found free from error: and as the conclusions to which I have endeavored to lead the reader
are thrown into a form the validity of which depends on that of each successive step, it might
be argued, if fallacy or weakness could be detected in one of them, that all the subsequent
reasonings were valueless. The reader may be assured, however, that it is not so; the method
of proof used in the following essay being only one out of many which were in my choice, adopted
because it seemed to me the shortest and simplest, not as being the strongest. In many cases,
the conclusions are those which men of quick feeling would arrive at instinctively; and I then
sought to discover the reasons of what so strongly recommended itself as truth. Though these
reasons could every one of them, from the beginning to the end of the book, be proved insufficient,
the truth of its conclusions would remain the same. I should only regret that I had dishonored
them by an ill-grounded defence; and endeavor to repair my error by a better one.

I have not, however, written carelessly; nor should I in any wise have expressed doubt of the
security of the following argument, but that it is physically impossible for me, being engaged
quite as much with mountains, and clouds, and trees, and criticism of painting, as with architecture,
to verify, as I should desire, the expression of every sentence bearing upon empirical and
technical matters. Life is not long enough; nor does a day pass by without causing me to feel
more bitterly the impossibility of carrying out to the extent which I should desire, the separate
studies which general criticism continually forces me to undertake. I can only assure the reader,
that he will find the certainty of every statement I permit myself to make, increase with its
importance; and that, for the security of the final conclusions of the following essay, as
well as for the resolute veracity of its account of whatever facts have come under my own immediate
cognizance, I will pledge myself to the uttermost.

It was necessary, to the accomplishment of the purpose of the work (of which account is given
in the First Chapter), that I should establish some canons of judgment, which the general reader
should thoroughly understand, and, if it pleased him, accept, before we took cognizance, together,
of any architecture whatsoever. It has taken me more time and trouble to do this than I expected;
but, if I have succeeded, the thing done will be of use for many other purposes than that to
which it is now put. The establishment of these canons, which I have called "the Foundations,"
and some account of the connection of Venetian architecture with that of the rest of Europe,
have filled the present volume. The second will, I hope, contain all I have to say about Venice
itself.

It was of course inexpedient to reduce drawings of crowded details to the size of an octavo
volume,--I do not say impossible, but inexpedient; requiring infinite pains on the part of
the engraver, with no result except farther pains to the beholder. And as, on the other hand,
folio books are not easy reading, I determined to separate the text and the unreducible plates.
I have given, with the principal text, all the illustrations absolutely necessary to the understanding
of it, and, in the detached work, such additional text as has special reference to the larger
illustrations.

A considerable number of these larger plates were at first intended to be executed in tinted
lithography; but, finding the result unsatisfactory, I have determined to prepare the principal
subjects for mezzotinting,--a change of method requiring two new drawings to be made of every
subject; one a carefully penned outline for the etcher, and then a finished drawing upon the
etching. This work does not proceed fast, while I am also occupied with the completion of the
text; but the numbers of it will appear as fast as I can prepare them.

For the illustrations of the body of the work itself, I have used any kind of engraving which
seemed suited to the subjects--line and mezzotint, on steel, with mixed lithographs and woodcuts,
at considerable loss of uniformity in the appearance of the volume, but, I hope, with advantage,
in rendering the character of the architecture it describes. And both in the plates and the
text I have aimed chiefly at clear intelligibility; that any one, however little versed in
the subject, might be able to take up the book, and understand what it meant forthwith. I have
utterly failed of my purpose, if I have not made all the essential parts of the essay intelligible
to the least learned, and easy to the most desultory readers, who are likely to take interest
in the matter at all. There are few passages which even require so much as an acquaintance
with the elements of Euclid, and these may be missed, without harm to the sense of the rest,
by every reader to whom they may appear mysterious; and the architectural terms necessarily
employed (which are very few) are explained as they occur, or in a note; so that, though I
may often be found trite or tedious, I trust that I shall not be obscure. I am especially anxious
to rid this essay of ambiguity, because I want to gain the ear of all kinds of persons. Every
man has, at some time of his life, personal interest in architecture. He has influence on the
design of some public building; or he has to buy, or build, or alter his own house. It signifies
less whether the knowledge of other arts be general or not; men may live without buying pictures
or statues: but, in architecture, all must in some way commit themselves; they must do mischief,
and waste their money, if they do not know how to turn it to account. Churches, and shops,
and warehouses, and cottages, and small row, and place, and terrace houses, must be built,
and lived in, however joyless or inconvenient. And it is assuredly intended that all of us
should have knowledge, and act upon our knowledge, in matters with which we are daily concerned,
and not to be left to the caprice of architects or mercy of contractors. There is not, indeed,
anything in the following essay bearing on the special forms and needs of modern buildings;
but the principles it inculcates are universal; and they are illustrated from the remains of
a city which should surely be interesting to the men of London, as affording the richest existing
examples of architecture raised by a mercantile community, for civil uses, and domestic magnificence.

CHAPTER II.

  THE VIRTUES OF ARCHITECTURE.

§ I. We address ourselves, then, first to the task of determining some law of right which we
may apply to the architecture of all the world and of all time; and by help of which, and judgment
according to which, we may easily pronounce whether a building is good or noble, as, by applying
a plumb-line, whether it be perpendicular.

The first question will of course be: What are the possible Virtues of architecture?

In the main, we require from buildings, as from men, two kinds of goodness: first, the doing
their practical duty well: then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it; which last
is itself another form of duty.

Then the practical duty divides itself into two branches,--acting and talking:--acting, as
to defend us from weather or violence; talking, as the duty of monuments or tombs, to record
facts and express feelings; or of churches, temples, public edifices, treated as books of history,
to tell such history clearly and forcibly.

We have thus, altogether, three great branches of architectural virtue, and we require of any
building,--

1. That it act well, and do the things it was intended to do in the best
    way.

2. That it speak well, and say the things it was intended to say in the
    best words.

3. That it look well, and please us by its presence, whatever it has to
    do or say.[28]

§ II. Now, as regards the second of these virtues, it is evident that we can establish no general
laws. First, because it is not a virtue required in all buildings; there are some which are
only for covert or defence, and from which we ask no conversation. Secondly, because there
are countless methods of expression, some conventional, some natural: each conventional mode
has its own alphabet, which evidently can be no subject of general laws. Every natural mode
is instinctively employed and instinctively understood, wherever there is true feeling; and
this instinct is above law. The choice of conventional methods depends on circumstances out
of calculation, and that of natural methods on sensations out of control; so that we can only
say that the choice is right, when we feel that the means are effective; and we cannot always
say that it is wrong when they are not so.

A building which recorded the Bible history by means of a series of sculptural pictures, would
be perfectly useless to a person unacquainted with the Bible beforehand; on the other hand,
the text of the Old and New Testaments might be written on its walls, and yet the building
be a very inconvenient kind of book, not so useful as if it had been adorned with intelligible
and vivid sculpture. So, again, the power of exciting emotion must vary or vanish, as the spectator
becomes thoughtless or cold; and the building may be often blamed for what is the fault of
its critic, or endowed with a charm which is of its spectator's creation. It is not, therefore,
possible to make expressional character any fair criterion of excellence in buildings, until
we can fully place ourselves in the position of those to whom their expression was originally
addressed, and until we are certain that we understand every symbol, and are capable of being
touched by every association which its builders employed as letters of their language. I shall
continually endeavor to put the reader into such sympathetic temper, when I ask for his judgment
of a building; and in every work I may bring before him I shall point out, as far as I am able,
whatever is peculiar in its expression; nay, I must even depend on such peculiarities for much
of my best evidence respecting the character of the builders. But I cannot legalize the judgment
for which I plead, nor insist upon it if it be refused. I can neither force the reader to feel
this architectural rhetoric, nor compel him to confess that the rhetoric is powerful, if it
have produced no impression on his own mind.

§ III. I leave, therefore, the expression of buildings for incidental notice only. But their
other two virtues are proper subjects of law,--their performance of their common and necessary
work, and their conformity with universal and divine canons of loveliness: respecting these
there can be no doubt, no ambiguity. I would have the reader discern them so quickly that,
as he passes along a street, he may, by a glance of the eye, distinguish the noble from the
ignoble work. He can do this, if he permit free play to his natural instincts; and all that
I have to do for him is to remove from those instincts the artificial restraints which prevent
their action, and to encourage them to an unaffected and unbiassed choice between right and wrong.

§ IV. We have, then, two qualities of buildings for subjects of separate inquiry: their action,
and aspect, and the sources of virtue in both; that is to say, Strength and Beauty, both of
these being less admired in themselves, than as testifying the intelligence or imagination
of the builder.

For we have a worthier way of looking at human than at divine architecture: much of the value
both of construction and decoration, in the edifices of men, depends upon our being led by
the thing produced or adorned, to some contemplation of the powers of mind concerned in its
creation or adornment. We are not so led by divine work, but are content to rest in the contemplation
of the thing created. I wish the reader to note this especially: we take pleasure, or should
take pleasure, in architectural construction altogether as the manifestation of an admirable
human intelligence; it is not the strength, not the size, not the finish of the work which
we are to venerate: rocks are always stronger, mountains always larger, all natural objects
more finished; but it is the intelligence and resolution of man in overcoming physical difficulty
which are to be the source of our pleasure and subject of our praise. And again, in decoration
or beauty, it is less the actual loveliness of the thing produced, than the choice and invention
concerned in the production, which are to delight us; the love and the thoughts of the workman
more than his work: his work must always be imperfect, but his thoughts and affections may
be true and deep.

§ V. This origin of our pleasure in architecture I must insist upon at somewhat greater length,
for I would fain do away with some of the ungrateful coldness which we show towards the good
builders of old time. In no art is there closer connection between our delight in the work,
and our admiration of the workman's mind, than in architecture, and yet we rarely ask for a
builder's name. The patron at whose cost, the monk through whose dreaming, the foundation was
laid, we remember occasionally; never the man who verily did the work. Did the reader ever
hear of William of Sens as having had anything to do with Canterbury Cathedral? or of Pietro
Basegio as in anywise connected with the Ducal Palace of Venice? There is much ingratitude
and injustice in this; and therefore I desire my reader to observe carefully how much of his
pleasure in building is derived, or should be derived, from admiration of the intellect of
men whose names he knows not.

§ VI. The two virtues of architecture which we can justly weigh, are, we said, its strength
or good construction, and its beauty or good decoration. Consider first, therefore, what you
mean when you say a building is well constructed or well built; you do not merely mean that
it answers its purpose,--this is much, and many modern buildings fail of this much; but if
it be verily well built, it must answer this purpose in the simplest way, and with no over-expenditure
of means. We require of a light-house, for instance, that it shall stand firm and carry a light;
if it do not this, assuredly it has been ill built; but it may do it to the end of time, and
yet not be well built. It may have hundreds of tons of stone in it more than were needed, and
have cost thousands of pounds more than it ought. To pronounce it well or ill built, we must
know the utmost forces it can have to resist, and the best arrangements of stone for encountering
them, and the quickest ways of effecting such arrangements: then only, so far as such arrangements
have been chosen, and such methods used, is it well built. Then the knowledge of all difficulties
to be met, and of all means of meeting them, and the quick and true fancy or invention of the
modes of applying the means to the end, are what we have to admire in the builder, even as
he is seen through this first or inferior part of his work. Mental power, observe: not muscular
nor mechanical, nor technical, nor empirical,--pure, precious, majestic, massy intellect; not
to be had at vulgar price, nor received without thanks, and without asking from whom.

§ VII. Suppose, for instance, we are present at the building of a bridge: the bricklayers or
masons have had their centring erected for them, and that centring was put together by a carpenter,
who had the line of its curve traced for him by the architect: the masons are dexterously handling
and fitting their bricks, or, by the help of machinery, carefully adjusting stones which are
numbered for their places. There is probably in their quickness of eye and readiness of hand
something admirable; but this is not what I ask the reader to admire: not the carpentering,
nor the bricklaying, nor anything that he can presently see and understand, but the choice
of the curve, and the shaping of the numbered stones, and the appointment of that number; there
were many things to be known and thought upon before these were decided. The man who chose
the curve and numbered the stones, had to know the times and tides of the river, and the strength
of its floods, and the height and flow of them, and the soil of the banks, and the endurance
of it, and the weight of the stones he had to build with, and the kind of traffic that day
by day would be carried on over his bridge,--all this specially, and all the great general
laws of force and weight, and their working; and in the choice of the curve and numbering of
stones are expressed not only his knowledge of these, but such ingenuity and firmness as he
had, in applying special means to overcome the special difficulties about his bridge. There
is no saying how much wit, how much depth of thought, how much fancy, presence of mind, courage,
and fixed resolution there may have gone to the placing of a single stone of it. This is what
we have to admire,--this grand power and heart of man in the thing; not his technical or empirical
way of holding the trowel and laying mortar.

§ VIII. Now there is in everything properly called art this concernment of the intellect, even
in the province of the art which seems merely practical. For observe: in this bridge-building
I suppose no reference to architectural principles; all that I suppose we want is to get safely
over the river; the man who has taken us over is still a mere bridge-builder,--a builder, not
an architect: he may be a rough, artless, feelingless man, incapable of doing any one truly
fine thing all his days. I shall call upon you to despise him presently in a sort, but not
as if he were a mere smoother of mortar; perhaps a great man, infinite in memory, indefatigable
in labor, exhaustless in expedient, unsurpassable in quickness of thought. Take good heed you
understand him before you despise him.

§ IX. But why is he to be in anywise despised? By no means despise him, unless he happen to
be without a soul,[29] or at least to show no signs of it; which possibly he may not in merely
carrying you across the river. He may be merely what Mr. Carlyle rightly calls a human beaver
after all; and there may be nothing in all that ingenuity of his greater than a complication
of animal faculties, an intricate bestiality,--nest or hive building in its highest development.
You need something more than this, or the man is despicable; you need that virtue of building
through which he may show his affections and delights; you need its beauty or decoration.

§ X. Not that, in reality, one division of the man is more human than another. Theologists
fall into this error very fatally and continually; and a man from whom I have learned much,
Lord Lindsay, has hurt his noble book by it, speaking as if the spirit of the man only were
immortal, and were opposed to his intellect, and the latter to the senses; whereas all the
divisions of humanity are noble or brutal, immortal or mortal, according to the degree of their
sanctification; and there is no part of the man which is not immortal and divine when it is
once given to God, and no part of him which is not mortal by the second death, and brutal before
the first, when it is withdrawn from God. For to what shall we trust for our distinction from
the beasts that perish? To our higher intellect?--yet are we not bidden to be wise as the serpent,
and to consider the ways of the ant?--or to our affections? nay; these are more shared by the
lower animals than our intelligence. Hamlet leaps into the grave of his beloved, and leaves
it,--a dog had stayed. Humanity and immortality consist neither in reason, nor in love; not
in the body, nor in the animation of the heart of it, nor in the thoughts and stirrings of
the brain of it,--but in the dedication of them all to Him who will raise them up at the last day.

§ XI. It is not, therefore, that the signs of his affections, which man leaves upon his work,
are indeed more ennobling than the signs of his intelligence; but it is the balance of both
whose expression we need, and the signs of the government of them all by Conscience; and Discretion,
the daughter of Conscience. So, then, the intelligent part of man being eminently, if not chiefly,
displayed in the structure of his work, his affectionate part is to be shown in its decoration;
and, that decoration may be indeed lovely, two things are needed: first, that the affections
be vivid, and honestly shown; secondly, that they be fixed on the right things.

§ XII. You think, perhaps, I have put the requirements in wrong order. Logically I have; practically
I have not: for it is necessary first to teach men to speak out, and say what they like, truly;
and, in the second place, to teach them which of their likings are ill set, and which justly.
If a man is cold in his likings and dislikings, or if he will not tell you what he likes, you
can make nothing of him. Only get him to feel quickly and to speak plainly, and you may set
him right. And the fact is, that the great evil of all recent architectural effort has not
been that men liked wrong things: but that they either cared nothing about any, or pretended
to like what they did not. Do you suppose that any modern architect likes what he builds, or
enjoys it? Not in the least. He builds it because he has been told that such and such things
are fine, and that he should like them. He pretends to like them, and gives them a false relish
of vanity. Do you seriously imagine, reader, that any living soul in London likes triglyphs?[30]--or
gets any hearty enjoyment out of pediments?[31] You are much mistaken. Greeks did: English
people never did,--never will. Do you fancy that the architect of old Burlington Mews, in Regent
Street, had any particular satisfaction in putting the blank triangle over the archway, instead
of a useful garret window? By no manner of means. He had been told it was right to do so, and
thought he should be admired for doing it. Very few faults of architecture are mistakes of
honest choice: they are almost always hypocrisies.

§ XIII. So, then, the first thing we have to ask of the decoration is that it should indicate
strong liking, and that honestly. It matters not so much what the thing is, as that the builder
should really love it and enjoy it, and say so plainly. The architect of Bourges Cathedral
liked hawthorns; so he has covered his porch with hawthorn,--it is a perfect Niobe of May.
Never was such hawthorn; you would try to gather it forthwith, but for fear of being pricked.
The old Lombard architects liked hunting; so they covered their work with horses and hounds,
and men blowing trumpets two yards long. The base Renaissance architects of Venice liked masquing
and fiddling; so they covered their work with comic masks and musical instruments. Even that
was better than our English way of liking nothing, and professing to like triglyphs.

§ XIV. But the second requirement in decoration, is a sign of our liking the right thing. And
the right thing to be liked is God's work, which He made for our delight and contentment in
this world. And all noble ornamentation is the expression of man's delight in God's work.

§ XV. So, then, these are the two virtues of building: first, the signs of man's own good work;
secondly, the expression of man's delight in better work than his own. And these are the two
virtues of which I desire my reader to be able quickly to judge, at least in some measure;
to have a definite opinion up to a certain point. Beyond a certain point he cannot form one.
When the science of the building is great, great science is of course required to comprehend
it; and, therefore, of difficult bridges, and light-houses, and harbor walls, and river dykes,
and railway tunnels, no judgment may be rapidly formed. But of common buildings, built in common
circumstances, it is very possible for every man, or woman, or child, to form judgment both
rational and rapid. Their necessary, or even possible, features are but few; the laws of their
construction are as simple as they are interesting. The labor of a few hours is enough to render
the reader master of their main points; and from that moment he will find in himself a power
of judgment which can neither be escaped nor deceived, and discover subjects of interest where
everything before had appeared barren. For though the laws are few and simple, the modes of
obedience to them are not so. Every building presents its own requirements and difficulties;
and every good building has peculiar appliances or contrivances to meet them. Understand the
laws of structure, and you will feel the special difficulty in every new building which you
approach; and you will know also, or feel instinctively,[32] whether it has been wisely met
or otherwise. And an enormous number of buildings, and of styles of buildings, you will be
able to cast aside at once, as at variance with these constant laws of structure, and therefore
unnatural and monstrous.

§ XVI. Then, as regards decoration, I want you only to consult your own natural choice and
liking. There is a right and wrong in it; but you will assuredly like the right if you suffer
your natural instinct to lead you. Half the evil in this world comes from people not knowing
what they do like, not deliberately setting themselves to find out what they really enjoy.
All people enjoy giving away money, for instance: they don't know that,--they rather think
they like keeping it; and they do keep it under this false impression, often to their great
discomfort. Every body likes to do good; but not one in a hundred finds this out. Multitudes
think they like to do evil; yet no man ever really enjoyed doing evil since God made the world.

So in this lesser matter of ornament. It needs some little care to try experiments upon yourself:
it needs deliberate question and upright answer. But there is no difficulty to be overcome,
no abstruse reasoning to be gone into; only a little watchfulness needed, and thoughtfulness,
and so much honesty as will enable you to confess to yourself and to all men, that you enjoy
things, though great authorities say you should not.

§ XVII. This looks somewhat like pride; but it is true humility, a trust that you have been
so created as to enjoy what is fitting for you, and a willingness to be pleased, as it was
intended you should be. It is the child's spirit, which we are then most happy when we most
recover; only wiser than children in that we are ready to think it subject of thankfulness
that we can still be pleased with a fair color or a dancing light. And, above all, do not try
to make all these pleasures reasonable, nor to connect the delight which you take in ornament
with that which you take in construction or usefulness. They have no connection; and every
effort that you make to reason from one to the other will blunt your sense of beauty, or confuse
it with sensations altogether inferior to it. You were made for enjoyment, and the world was
filled with things which you will enjoy, unless you are too proud to be pleased by them, or
too grasping to care for what you cannot turn to other account than mere delight. Remember
that the most beautiful things in the world are the most useless; peacocks and lilies for instance;
at least I suppose this quill I hold in my hand writes better than a peacock's would, and the
peasants of Vevay, whose fields in spring time are as white with lilies as the Dent du Midi
is with its snow, told me the hay was none the better for them.

§ XVIII. Our task therefore divides itself into two branches, and these I shall follow in succession.
I shall first consider the construction of buildings, dividing them into their really necessary
members or features; and I shall endeavor so to lead the reader forward from the foundation
upwards, as that he may find out for himself the best way of doing everything, and having so
discovered it, never forget it. I shall give him stones, and bricks, and straw, chisels, and
trowels, and the ground, and then ask him to build; only helping him, as I can, if I find him
puzzled. And when he has built his house or church, I shall ask him to ornament it, and leave
it to him to choose the ornaments as I did to find out the construction: I shall use no influence
with him whatever, except to counteract previous prejudices, and leave him, as far as may be,
free. And when he has thus found out how to build, and chosen his forms of decoration, I shall
do what I can to confirm his confidence in what he has done. I shall assure him that no one
in the world could, so far, have done better, and require him to condemn, as futile or fallacious,
whatever has no resemblance to his own performances.

CHAPTER III.

  THE SIX DIVISIONS OF ARCHITECTURE.

§ I. The practical duties of buildings are twofold.

They have either (1), to hold and protect something; or (2), to place or carry something.

1. Architecture of Protection. This is architecture intended to
   protect men or their possessions from violence of any kind, whether
   of men or of the elements. It will include all churches, houses, and
   treasuries; fortresses, fences, and ramparts; the architecture of the
   hut and sheepfold; of the palace and the citadel: of the dyke,
   breakwater, and sea-wall. And the protection, when of living
   creatures, is to be understood as including commodiousness and
   comfort of habitation, wherever these are possible under the given
   circumstances.

2. Architecture of Position. This is architecture intended to carry
   men or things to some certain places, or to hold them there. This
   will include all bridges, aqueducts, and road architecture;
   light-houses, which have to hold light in appointed places; chimneys
   to carry smoke or direct currents of air; staircases; towers, which
   are to be watched from or cried from, as in mosques, or to hold
   bells, or to place men in positions of offence, as ancient moveable
   attacking towers, and most fortress towers.

§ II. Protective architecture has to do one or all of three things: to wall a space, to roof
it, and to give access to it, of persons, light, and air; and it is therefore to be considered
under the three divisions of walls, roofs, and apertures.

We will take, first, a short, general view of the connection of these members, and then examine
them in detail: endeavoring always to keep the simplicity of our first arrangement in view;
for protective architecture has indeed no other members than these, unless flooring and paving
be considered architecture, which it is only when the flooring is also a roof; the laying of
the stones or timbers for footing being pavior's or carpenter's work, rather than architect's;
and, at all events, work respecting the well or ill doing of which we shall hardly find much
difference of opinion, except in points of æsthetics. We shall therefore concern ourselves
only with the construction of walls, roofs, and apertures.

§ III. 1. Walls.--A wall is an even and united fence, whether of wood, earth, stone, or metal.
When meant for purposes of mere partition or enclosure, it remains a wall proper: but it has
generally also to sustain a certain vertical or lateral pressure, for which its strength is
at first increased by some general addition to its thickness; but if the pressure becomes very
great, it is gathered up into piers to resist vertical pressure, and supported by buttresses
to resist lateral pressure.

If its functions of partition or enclosure are continued, together with that of resisting vertical
pressure, it remains as a wall veil between the piers into which it has been partly gathered;
but if it is required only to resist the vertical or roof pressure, it is gathered up into
piers altogether, loses its wall character, and becomes a group or line of piers.

On the other hand, if the lateral pressure be slight, it may retain its character of a wall,
being supported against the pressure by buttresses at intervals; but if the lateral pressure
be very great, it is supported against such pressure by a continuous buttress, loses its wall
character, and becomes a dyke or rampart.

§ IV. We shall have therefore (A) first to get a general idea of a wall, and of right construction
of walls; then (B) to see how this wall is gathered into piers; and to get a general idea of
piers and the right construction of piers; then (C) to see how a wall is supported by buttresses,
and to get a general idea of buttresses and the right construction of buttresses. This is surely
very simple, and it is all we shall have to do with walls and their divisions.

§ V. 2. Roofs.--A roof is the covering of a space, narrow or wide. It will be most conveniently
studied by first considering the forms in which it may be carried over a narrow space, and
then expanding these on a wide plan; only there is some difficulty here in the nomenclature,
for an arched roof over a narrow space has (I believe) no name, except that which belongs properly
to the piece of stone or wood composing such a roof, namely, lintel. But the reader will have
no difficulty in understanding that he is first to consider roofs on the section only, thinking
how best to construct a narrow bar or slice of them, of whatever form; as, for instance, x,
y, or z, over the plan or area a, Fig. I. Having done this, let him imagine these several divisions,
first moved along (or set side by side) over a rectangle, b, Fig. I., and then revolved round
a point (or crossed at it) over a polygon, c, or circle, d, and he will have every form of
simple roof: the arched section giving successively the vaulted roof and dome, and the gabled
section giving the gabled roof and spire.

As we go farther into the subject, we shall only have to add one or two forms to the sections
here given, in order to embrace all the uncombined roofs in existence; and we shall not trouble
the reader with many questions respecting cross-vaulting, and other modes of their combination.

§ VI. Now, it also happens, from its place in buildings, that the sectional roof over a narrow
space will need to be considered before we come to the expanded roof over a broad one. For
when a wall has been gathered, as above explained, into piers, that it may better bear vertical
pressure, it is generally necessary that it should be expanded again at the top into a continuous
wall before it carries the true roof. Arches or lintels are, therefore, thrown from pier to
pier, and a level preparation for carrying the real roof is made above them. After we have
examined the structure of piers, therefore, we shall have to see how lintels or arches are
thrown from pier to pier, and the whole prepared for the superincumbent roof; this arrangement
being universal in all good architecture prepared for vertical pressures: and we shall then
examine the condition of the great roof itself. And because the structure of the roof very
often introduces certain lateral pressures which have much to do with the placing of buttresses,
it will be well to do all this before we examine the nature of buttresses, and, therefore,
between parts (B) and (C) of the above plan, § IV. So now we shall have to study: (A) the construction
of walls; (B) that of piers; (C) that of lintels or arches prepared for roofing; (D) that of
roofs proper; and (E) that of buttresses.

§ VII. 3. Apertures.--There must either be intervals between the piers, of which intervals
the character will be determined by that of the piers themselves, or else doors or windows
in the walls proper. And, respecting doors or windows, we have to determine three things: first,
the proper shape of the entire aperture; secondly, the way in which it is to be filled with
valves or glass; and thirdly, the modes of protecting it on the outside, and fitting appliances
of convenience to it, as porches or balconies. And this will be our division F; and if the
reader will have the patience to go through these six heads, which include every possible feature
of protective architecture, and to consider the simple necessities and fitnesses of each, I
will answer for it, he shall never confound good architecture with bad any more. For, as to
architecture of position, a great part of it involves necessities of construction with which
the spectator cannot become generally acquainted, and of the compliance with which he is therefore
never expected to judge,--as in chimneys, light-houses, &c.: and the other forms of it are
so closely connected with those of protective architecture, that a few words in Chap. XIX.
respecting staircases and towers, will contain all with which the reader need be troubled on
the subject.

CHAPTER IV.

  THE WALL BASE.

§ I. Our first business, then, is with Wall, and to find out wherein lies the true excellence
of the "Wittiest Partition." For it is rather strange that, often as we speak of a "dead" wall,
and that with considerable disgust, we have not often, since Snout's time, heard of a living
one. But the common epithet of opprobrium is justly bestowed, and marks a right feeling. A
wall has no business to be dead. It ought to have members in its make, and purposes in its
existence, like an organized creature, and to answer its ends in a living and energetic way;
and it is only when we do not choose to put any strength nor organization into it, that it
offends us by its deadness. Every wall ought to be a "sweet and lovely wall." I do not care
about its having ears; but, for instruction and exhortation, I would often have it to "hold
up its fingers." What its necessary members and excellences are, it is our present business
to discover.

§ II. A wall has been defined to be an even and united fence of wood, earth, stone, or metal.
Metal fences, however, seldom, if ever, take the form of walls, but of railings; and, like
all other metal constructions, must be left out of our present investigation; as may be also
walls composed merely of light planks or laths for purposes of partition or inclosure. Substantial
walls, whether of wood or earth (I use the word earth as including clay, baked or unbaked,
and stone), have, in their perfect form, three distinct members;--the Foundation, Body or Veil,
and Cornice.

§ III. The foundation is to the wall what the paw is to an animal. It is a long foot, wider
than the wall, on which the wall is to stand, and which keeps it from settling into the ground.
It is most necessary that this great element of security should be visible to the eye, and
therefore made a part of the structure above ground. Sometimes, indeed, it becomes incorporated
with the entire foundation of the building, a vast table on which walls or piers are alike
set: but even then, the eye, taught by the reason, requires some additional preparation or
foot for the wall, and the building is felt to be imperfect without it. This foundation we
shall call the Base of the wall.

§ IV. The body of the wall is of course the principal mass of it, formed of mud or clay, of
bricks or stones, of logs or hewn timber; the condition of structure being, that it is of equal
thickness everywhere, below and above. It may be half a foot thick, or six feet thick, or fifty
feet thick; but if of equal thickness everywhere, it is still a wall proper: if to its fifty
feet of proper thickness there be added so much as an inch of thickness in particular parts,
that added thickness is to be considered as some form of buttress or pier, or other appliance.[33]

In perfect architecture, however, the walls are generally kept of moderate thickness, and strengthened
by piers or buttresses; and the part of the wall between these, being generally intended only
to secure privacy, or keep out the slighter forces of weather, may be properly called a Wall
Veil. I shall always use this word "Veil" to signify the even portion of a wall, it being more
expressive than the term Body.

§ V. When the materials with which this veil is built are very loose, or of shapes which do
not fit well together, it sometimes becomes necessary, or at least adds to security, to introduce
courses of more solid material. Thus, bricks alternate with rolled pebbles in the old walls
of Verona, and hewn stones with brick in its Lombard churches. A banded structure, almost a
stratification of the wall, is thus produced; and the courses of more solid material are sometimes
decorated with carving. Even when the wall is not thus banded through its whole height, it
frequently becomes expedient to lay a course of stone, or at least of more carefully chosen
materials, at regular heights; and such belts or bands we may call String courses. These are
a kind of epochs in the wall's existence; something like periods of rest and reflection in
human life, before entering on a new career. Or else, in the building, they correspond to the
divisions of its stories within, express its internal structure, and mark off some portion
of the ends of its existence already attained.

§ VI. Finally, on the top of the wall some protection from the weather is necessary, or some
preparation for the reception of superincumbent weight, called a coping, or Cornice. I shall
use the word Cornice for both; for, in fact, a coping is a roof to the wall itself, and is
carried by a small cornice as the roof of the building by a large one. In either case, the
cornice, small or large, is the termination of the wall's existence, the accomplishment of
its work. When it is meant to carry some superincumbent weight, the cornice may be considered
as its hand, opened to carry something above its head; as the base was considered its foot:
and the three parts should grow out of each other and form one whole, like the root, stalk,
and bell of a flower.

These three parts we shall examine in succession; and, first, the Base.

§ VII. It may be sometimes in our power, and it is always expedient, to prepare for the whole
building some settled foundation, level and firm, out of sight. But this has not been done
in some of the noblest buildings in existence. It cannot always be done perfectly, except at
enormous expense; and, in reasoning upon the superstructure, we shall never suppose it to be
done. The mind of the spectator does not conceive it; and he estimates the merits of the edifice
on the supposition of its being built upon the ground. Even if there be a vast table land of
foundation elevated for the whole of it, accessible by steps all round, as at Pisa, the surface
of this table is always conceived as capable of yielding somewhat to superincumbent weight,
and generally is so; and we shall base all our arguments on the widest possible supposition,
that is to say, that the building stands on a surface either of earth, or, at all events, capable
of yielding in some degree to its weight.

§ VIII. Now, let the reader simply ask himself how, on such a surface, he would set about building
a substantial wall, that should be able to bear weight and to stand for ages. He would assuredly
look about for the largest stones he had at his disposal, and, rudely levelling the ground,
he would lay these well together over a considerably larger width than he required the wall
to be (suppose as at a, Fig. II.), in order to equalise the pressure of the wall over a large
surface, and form its foot. On the top of these he would perhaps lay a second tier of large
stones, b, or even the third, c, making the breadth somewhat less each time, so as to prepare
for the pressure of the wall on the centre, and, naturally or necessarily, using somewhat smaller
stones above than below (since we supposed him to look about for the largest first), and cutting
them more neatly. His third tier, if not his second, will probably appear a sufficiently secure
foundation for finer work; for if the earth yield at all, it will probably yield pretty equally
under the great mass of masonry now knit together over it. So he will prepare for the wall
itself at once by sloping off the next tier of stones to the right diameter, as at d. If there
be any joints in this tier within the wall, he may perhaps, for further security, lay a binding
stone across them, e, and then begin the work of the wall veil itself, whether in bricks or stones.

§ IX. I have supposed the preparation here to be for a large wall, because such a preparation
will give us the best general type. But it is evident that the essential features of the arrangement
are only two, that is to say, one tier of massy work for foundation, suppose c, missing the
first two; and the receding tier or real foot of the wall, d. The reader will find these members,
though only of brick, in most of the considerable and independent walls in the suburbs of London.

§ X. It is evident, however, that the general type, Fig. II., will be subject to many different
modifications in different circumstances. Sometimes the ledges of the tiers a and b may be
of greater width; and when the building is in a secure place, and of finished masonry, these
may be sloped off also like the main foot d. In Venetian buildings these lower ledges are exposed
to the sea, and therefore left rough hewn; but in fine work and in important positions the
lower ledges may be bevelled and decorated like the upper, or another added above d; and all
these parts may be in different proportions, according to the disposition of the building above
them. But we have nothing to do with any of these variations at present, they being all more
or less dependent upon decorative considerations, except only one of very great importance,
that is to say, the widening of the lower ledge into a stone seat, which may be often done
in buildings of great size with most beautiful effect: it looks kind and hospitable, and preserves
the work above from violence. In St. Mark's at Venice, which is a small and low church, and
needing no great foundation for the wall veils of it, we find only the three members, b, c,
and d. Of these the first rises about a foot above the pavement of St. Mark's Place, and forms
an elevated dais in some of the recesses of the porches, chequered red and white; c forms a
seat which follows the line of the walls, while its basic character is marked by its also carrying
certain shafts with which we have here no concern; d is of white marble; and all are enriched
and decorated in the simplest and most perfect manner possible, as we shall see in Chap. XXV.
And thus much may serve to fix the type of wall bases, a type oftener followed in real practice
than any other we shall hereafter be enabled to determine: for wall bases of necessity must
be solidly built, and the architect is therefore driven into the adoption of the right form;
or if he deviate from it, it is generally in meeting some necessity of peculiar circumstances,
as in obtaining cellars and underground room, or in preparing for some grand features or particular
parts of the wall, or in some mistaken idea of decoration,--into which errors we had better
not pursue him until we understand something more of the rest of the building: let us therefore
proceed to consider the wall veil.

FOOTNOTES:

  [33] Many walls are slightly sloped or curved towards their tops,
    and have buttresses added to them (that of the Queen's Bench Prison
    is a curious instance of the vertical buttress and inclined wall);
    but in all such instances the slope of the wall is properly to be
    considered a condition of incorporated buttress.

CHAPTER V.

  THE WALL VEIL.

§ I. The summer of the year 1849 was spent by the writer in researches little bearing upon
his present subject, and connected chiefly with proposed illustrations of the mountain forms
in the works of J. M. W. Turner. But there are sometimes more valuable lessons to be learned
in the school of nature than in that of Vitruvius, and a fragment of building among the Alps
is singularly illustrative of the chief feature which I have at present to develope as necessary
to the perfection of the wall veil.

It is a fragment of some size; a group of broken walls, one of them overhanging; crowned with
a cornice, nodding some hundred and fifty feet over its massy flank, three thousand above its
glacier base, and fourteen thousand above the sea,--a wall truly of some majesty, at once the
most precipitous and the strongest mass in the whole chain of the Alps, the Mont Cervin.

§ II. It has been falsely represented as a peak or tower. It is a vast ridged promontory, connected
at its western root with the Dent d'Erin, and lifting itself like a rearing horse with its
face to the east. All the way along the flank of it, for half a day's journey on the Zmutt
glacier, the grim black terraces of its foundations range almost without a break; and the clouds,
when their day's work is done, and they are weary, lay themselves down on those foundation
steps, and rest till dawn, each with his leagues of grey mantle stretched along the grisly
ledge, and the cornice of the mighty wall gleaming in the moonlight, three thousand feet above.

§ III. The eastern face of the promontory is hewn down, as if by the single sweep of a sword,
from the crest of it to the base; hewn concave and smooth, like the hollow of a wave: on each
flank of it there is set a buttress, both of about equal height, their heads sloped out from
the main wall about seven hundred feet below its summit. That on the north is the most important;
it is as sharp as the frontal angle of a bastion, and sloped sheer away to the north-east,
throwing out spur beyond spur, until it terminates in a long low curve of russet precipice,
at whose foot a great bay of the glacier of the Col de Cervin lies as level as a lake. This
spur is one of the few points from which the mass of the Mont Cervin is in anywise approachable.
It is a continuation of the masonry of the mountain itself, and affords us the means of examining
the character of its materials.

§ IV. Few architects would like to build with them. The slope of the rocks to the north-west
is covered two feet deep with their ruins, a mass of loose and slaty shale, of a dull brick-red
color, which yields beneath the foot like ashes, so that, in running down, you step one yard,
and slide three. The rock is indeed hard beneath, but still disposed in thin courses of these
cloven shales, so finely laid that they look in places more like a heap of crushed autumn leaves
than a rock; and the first sensation is one of unmitigated surprise, as if the mountain were
upheld by miracle; but surprise becomes more intelligent reverence for the great builder, when
we find, in the middle of the mass of these dead leaves, a course of living rock, of quartz
as white as the snow that encircles it, and harder than a bed of steel.

§ V. It is one only of a thousand iron bands that knit the strength of the mighty mountain.
Through the buttress and the wall alike, the courses of its varied masonry are seen in their
successive order, smooth and true as if laid by line and plummet,[34] but of thickness and
strength continually varying, and with silver cornices glittering along the edge of each, laid
by the snowy winds and carved by the sunshine,--stainless ornaments of the eternal temple,
by which "neither the hammer nor the axe, nor any tool, was heard while it was in building."

§ VI. I do not, however, bring this forward as an instance of any universal law of natural
building; there are solid as well as coursed masses of precipice, but it is somewhat curious
that the most noble cliff in Europe, which this eastern front of the Cervin is, I believe,
without dispute, should be to us an example of the utmost possible stability of precipitousness
attained with materials of imperfect and variable character; and, what is more, there are very
few cliffs which do not display alternations between compact and friable conditions of their
material, marked in their contours by bevelled slopes when the bricks are soft, and vertical
steps when they are harder. And, although we are not hence to conclude that it is well to introduce
courses of bad materials when we can get perfect material, I believe we may conclude with great
certainty that it is better and easier to strengthen a wall necessarily of imperfect substance,
as of brick, by introducing carefully laid courses of stone, than by adding to its thickness;
and the first impression we receive from the unbroken aspect of a wall veil, unless it be of
hewn stone throughout, is that it must be both thicker and weaker than it would have been,
had it been properly coursed. The decorative reasons for adopting the coursed arrangement,
which we shall notice hereafter, are so weighty, that they would alone be almost sufficient
to enforce it; and the constructive ones will apply universally, except in the rare cases in
which the choice of perfect or imperfect material is entirely open to us, or where the general
system of the decoration of the building requires absolute unity in its surface.

§ VII. As regards the arrangement of the intermediate parts themselves, it is regulated by
certain conditions of bonding and fitting the stones or bricks, which the reader need hardly
be troubled to consider, and which I wish that bricklayers themselves were always honest enough
to observe. But I hardly know whether to note under the head of æsthetic or constructive law,
this important principle, that masonry is always bad which appears to have arrested the attention
of the architect more than absolute conditions of strength require. Nothing is more contemptible
in any work than an appearance of the slightest desire on the part of the builder to direct
attention to the way its stones are put together, or of any trouble taken either to show or
to conceal it more than was rigidly necessary: it may sometimes, on the one hand, be necessary
to conceal it as far as may be, by delicate and close fitting, when the joints would interfere
with lines of sculpture or of mouldings; and it may often, on the other hand, be delightful
to show it, as it is delightful in places to show the anatomy even of the most delicate human
frame: but studiously to conceal it is the error of vulgar painters, who are afraid to show
that their figures have bones; and studiously to display it is the error of the base pupils
of Michael Angelo, who turned heroes' limbs into surgeons' diagrams,--but with less excuse
than theirs, for there is less interest in the anatomy displayed. Exhibited masonry is in most
cases the expedient of architects who do not know how to fill up blank spaces, and many a building,
which would have been decent enough if let alone, has been scrawled over with straight lines,
as in Fig. III., on exactly the same principles, and with just the same amount of intelligence
as a boy's in scrawling his copy-book when he cannot write. The device was thought ingenious
at one period of architectural history; St. Paul's and Whitehall are covered with it, and it
is in this I imagine that some of our modern architects suppose the great merit of those buildings
to consist. There is, however, no excuse for errors in disposition of masonry, for there is
but one law upon the subject, and that easily complied with, to avoid all affectation and all
unnecessary expense, either in showing or concealing. Every one knows a building is built of
separate stones; nobody will ever object to seeing that it is so, but nobody wants to count
them. The divisions of a church are much like the divisions of a sermon; they are always right
so long as they are necessary to edification, and always wrong when they are thrust upon the
attention as divisions only. There may be neatness in carving when there is richness in feasting;
but I have heard many a discourse, and seen many a church wall, in which it was all carving
and no meat.

CHAPTER VI.

  THE WALL CORNICE.

§ I. We have lastly to consider the close of the wall's existence, or its cornice. It was above
stated, that a cornice has one of two offices: if the wall have nothing to carry, the cornice
is its roof, and defends it from the weather; if there is weight to be carried above the wall,
the cornice is its hand, and is expanded to carry the said weight.

There are several ways of roofing or protecting independent walls, according to the means nearest
at hand: sometimes the wall has a true roof all to itself; sometimes it terminates in a small
gabled ridge, made of bricks set slanting, as constantly in the suburbs of London; or of hewn
stone, in stronger work; or in a single sloping face, inclined to the outside. We need not
trouble ourselves at present about these small roofings, which are merely the diminutions of
large ones; but we must examine the important and constant member of the wall structure, which
prepares it either for these small roofs or for weights above, and is its true cornice.

§ II. The reader will, perhaps, as heretofore, be kind enough to think for himself, how, having
carried up his wall veil as high as it may be needed, he will set about protecting it from
weather, or preparing it for weight. Let him imagine the top of the unfinished wall, as it
would be seen from above with all the joints, perhaps uncemented, or imperfectly filled up
with cement, open to the sky; and small broken materials filling gaps between large ones, and
leaving cavities ready for the rain to soak into, and loosen and dissolve the cement, and split,
as it froze, the whole to pieces. I am much mistaken if his first impulse would not be to take
a great flat stone and lay it on the top; or rather a series of such, side by side, projecting
well over the edge of the wall veil. If, also, he proposed to lay a weight (as, for instance,
the end of a beam) on the wall, he would feel at once that the pressure of this beam on, or
rather among, the small stones of the wall veil, might very possibly dislodge or disarrange
some of them; and the first impulse would be, in this case, also to lay a large flat stone
on the top of all to receive the beam, or any other weight, and distribute it equally among
the small stones below, as at a, Fig. IV.

§ III. We must therefore have our flat stone in either case; and let b, Fig. IV., be the section
or side of it, as it is set across the wall. Now, evidently, if by any chance this weight happen
to be thrown more on the edges of this stone than the centre, there will be a chance of these
edges breaking off. Had we not better, therefore, put another stone, sloped off to the wall,
beneath the projecting one, as at c. But now our cornice looks somewhat too heavy for the wall;
and as the upper stone is evidently of needless thickness, we will thin it somewhat, and we
have the form d. Now observe: the lower or bevelled stone here at d corresponds to d in the
base (Fig. II., page 59). That was the foot of the wall; this is its hand. And the top stone
here, which is a constant member of cornices, corresponds to the under stone c, in Fig. II.,
which is a constant member of bases. The reader has no idea at present of the enormous importance
of these members; but as we shall have to refer to them perpetually, I must ask him to compare
them, and fix their relations well in his mind: and, for convenience, I shall call the bevelled
or sloping stone, X, and the upright edged stone, Y. The reader may remember easily which is
which; for X is an intersection of two slopes, and may therefore properly mean either of the
two sloping stones; and Y is a figure with a perpendicular line and two slopes, and may therefore
fitly stand for the upright stone in relation to each of the sloping ones; and as we shall
have to say much more about cornices than about bases, let X and Y stand for the stones of
the cornice, and Xb and Yb for those of the base, when distinction is needed.

§ IV. Now the form at d, Fig. IV., is the great root and primal type of all cornices whatsoever.
In order to see what forms may be developed from it, let us take its profile a little larger--a,
Fig. V., with X and Y duly marked. Now this form, being the root of all cornices, may either
have to finish the wall and so keep off rain; or, as so often stated, to carry weight. If the
former, it is evident that, in its present profile, the rain will run back down the slope of
X; and if the latter, that the sharp angle or edge of X, at k, may be a little too weak for
its work, and run a chance of giving way. To avoid the evil in the first case, suppose we hollow
the slope of X inwards, as at b; and to avoid it in the second case, suppose we strengthen
X by letting it bulge outwards, as at c.

§ V. These (b and c) are the profiles of two vast families of cornices, springing from the
same root, which, with a third arising from their combination (owing its origin to æsthetic
considerations, and inclining sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other), have been employed,
each on its third part of the architecture of the whole world throughout all ages, and must
continue to be so employed through such time as is yet to come. We do not at present speak
of the third or combined group; but the relation of the two main branches to each other, and
to the line of origin, is given at e, Fig. V.; where the dotted lines are the representatives
of the two families, and the straight line of the root. The slope of this right line, as well
as the nature of the curves, here drawn as segments of circles, we leave undetermined: the
slope, as well as the proportion of the depths of X and Y to each other, vary according to
the weight to be carried, the strength of the stone, the size of the cornice, and a thousand
other accidents; and the nature of the curves according to æsthetic laws. It is in these infinite
fields that the invention of the architect is permitted to expatiate, but not in the alteration
of primitive forms.

§ VI. But to proceed. It will doubtless appear to the reader, that, even allowing for some
of these permissible variations in the curve or slope of X, neither the form at b, nor any
approximation to that form, would be sufficiently undercut to keep the rain from running back
upon it. This is true; but we have to consider that the cornice, as the close of the wall's
life, is of all its features that which is best fitted for honor and ornament. It has been
esteemed so by almost all builders, and has been lavishly decorated in modes hereafter to be
considered. But it is evident that, as it is high above the eye, the fittest place to receive
the decoration is the slope of X, which is inclined towards the spectator; and if we cut away
or hollow out this slope more than we have done at b, all decoration will be hid in the shadow.
If, therefore, the climate be fine, and rain of long continuance not to be dreaded, we shall
not hollow the stone X further, adopting the curve at b merely as the most protective in our
power. But if the climate be one in which rain is frequent and dangerous, as in alternations
with frost, we may be compelled to consider the cornice in a character distinctly protective,
and to hollow out X farther, so as to enable it thoroughly to accomplish its purpose. A cornice
thus treated loses its character as the crown or honor of the wall, takes the office of its
protector, and is called a DRIPSTONE. The dripstone is naturally the attribute of Northern
buildings, and therefore especially of Gothic architecture; the true cornice is the attribute
of Southern buildings, and therefore of Greek and Italian architecture; and it is one of their
peculiar beauties, and eminent features of superiority.

§ VII. Before passing to the dripstone, however, let us examine a little farther into the nature
of the true cornice. We cannot, indeed, render either of the forms b or c, Fig. V., perfectly
protective from rain, but we can help them a little in their duty by a slight advance of their
upper ledge. This, with the form b, we can best manage by cutting off the sharp upper point
of its curve, which is evidently weak and useless; and we shall have the form f. By a slight
advance of the upper stone c, we shall have the parallel form g.

These two cornices, f and g, are characteristic of early Byzantine work, and are found on all
the most lovely examples of it in Venice. The type a is rarer, but occurs pure in the most
exquisite piece of composition in Venice--the northern portico of St. Mark's; and will be given
in due time.

§ VIII. Now the reader has doubtless noticed that these forms of cornice result, from considerations
of fitness and necessity, far more neatly and decisively than the forms of the base, which
we left only very generally determined. The reason is, that there are many ways of building
foundations, and many good ways, dependent upon the peculiar accidents of the ground and nature
of accessible materials. There is also room to spare in width, and a chance of a part of the
arrangement being concealed by the ground, so as to modify height. But we have no room to spare
in width on the top of a wall, and all that we do must be thoroughly visible; and we can but
have to deal with bricks, or stones of a certain degree of fineness, and not with mere gravel,
or sand, or clay,--so that as the conditions are limited, the forms become determined; and
our steps will be more clear and certain the farther we advance. The sources of a river are
usually half lost among moss and pebbles, and its first movements doubtful in direction; but,
as the current gathers force, its banks are determined, and its branches are numbered.

§ IX. So far of the true cornice: we have still to determine the form of the dripstone.

We go back to our primal type or root of cornice, a of Fig. V. We take this at a in Fig. VI.,
and we are to consider it entirely as a protection against rain. Now the only way in which
the rain can be kept from running back on the slope of X is by a bold hollowing out of it upwards,
b. But clearly, by thus doing, we shall so weaken the projecting part of it that the least
shock would break it at the neck, c; we must therefore cut the whole out of one stone, which
will give us the form d. That the water may not lodge on the upper ledge of this, we had better
round it off; and it will better protect the joint at the bottom of the slope if we let the
stone project over it in a roll, cutting the recess deeper above. These two changes are made
in e: e is the type of dripstones; the projecting part being, however, more or less rounded
into an approximation to the shape of a falcon's beak, and often reaching it completely. But
the essential part of the arrangement is the up and under cutting of the curve. Wherever we
find this, we are sure that the climate is wet, or that the builders have been bred in a wet
country, and that the rest of the building will be prepared for rough weather. The up cutting
of the curve is sometimes all the distinction between the mouldings of far-distant countries
and utterly strange nations.

Fig. VII. representing a moulding with an outer and inner curve, the latter undercut. Take
the outer line, and this moulding is one constant in Venice, in architecture traceable to Arabian
types, and chiefly to the early mosques of Cairo. But take the inner line; it is a dripstone
at Salisbury. In that narrow interval between the curves there is, when we read it rightly,
an expression of another and mightier curve,--the orbed sweep of the earth and sea, between
the desert of the Pyramids, and the green and level fields through which the clear streams
of Sarum wind so slowly.

And so delicate is the test, that though pure cornices are often found in the north,--borrowed
from classical models,--so surely as we find a true dripstone moulding in the South, the influence
of Northern builders has been at work; and this will be one of the principal evidences which
I shall use in detecting Lombard influence on Arab work; for the true Byzantine and Arab mouldings
are all open to the sky and light, but the Lombards brought with them from the North the fear
of rain, and in all the Lombardic Gothic we instantly recognize the shadowy dripstone: a, Fig.
VIII., is from a noble fragment at Milan, in the Piazza dei Mercanti; b, from the Broletto
of Como. Compare them with c and d; both from Salisbury; e and f from Lisieux, Normandy; g
and h from Wenlock Abbey, Shropshire.

§ X. The reader is now master of all that he need know about the construction of the general
wall cornice, fitted either to become a crown of the wall, or to carry weight above. If, however,
the weight above become considerable, it may be necessary to support the cornice at intervals
with brackets; especially if it be required to project far, as well as to carry weight; as,
for instance, if there be a gallery on top of the wall. This kind of bracket-cornice, deep
or shallow, forms a separate family, essentially connected with roofs and galleries; for if
there be no superincumbent weight, it is evidently absurd to put brackets to a plain cornice
or dripstone (though this is sometimes done in carrying out a style); so that, as soon as we
see a bracket put to a cornice, it implies, or should imply, that there is a roof or gallery
above it. Hence this family of cornices I shall consider in connection with roofing, calling
them "roof cornices," while what we have hitherto examined are proper "wall cornices." The
roof cornice and wall cornice are therefore treated in division D.

We are not, however, as yet nearly ready for our roof. We have only obtained that which was
to be the object of our first division (A); we have got, that is to say, a general idea of
a wall and of the three essential parts of a wall; and we have next, it will be remembered,
to get an idea of a pier and the essential parts of a pier, which were to be the subjects of
our second division (B).

CHAPTER VII.

  THE PIER BASE.

§ I. In § III. of Chap. III., it was stated that when a wall had to sustain an addition of
vertical pressure, it was first fitted to sustain it by some addition to its own thickness;
but if the pressure became very great, by being gathered up into PIERS.

I must first make the reader understand what I mean by a wall's being gathered up. Take a piece
of tolerably thick drawing-paper, or thin Bristol board, five or six inches square. Set it
on its edge on the table, and put a small octavo book on the edge or top of it, and it will
bend instantly. Tear it into four strips all across, and roll up each strip tightly. Set these
rolls on end on the table, and they will carry the small octavo perfectly well. Now the thickness
or substance of the paper employed to carry the weight is exactly the same as it was before,
only it is differently arranged, that is to say, "gathered up."[35] If therefore a wall be
gathered up like the Bristol board, it will bear greater weight than it would if it remained
a wall veil. The sticks into which you gather it are called Piers. A pier is a coagulated wall.

§ II. Now you cannot quite treat the wall as you did the Bristol board, and twist it up at
once; but let us see how you can treat it. Let A, Fig. IX., be the plan of a wall which you
have made inconveniently and expensively thick, and which still appears to be slightly too
weak for what it must carry: divide it, as at B, into equal spaces, a, b, a, b, &c. Cut out
a thin slice of it at every a on each side, and put the slices you cut out on at every b on
each side, and you will have the plan at B, with exactly the same quantity of bricks. But your
wall is now so much concentrated, that, if it was only slightly too weak before, it will be
stronger now than it need be; so you may spare some of your space as well as your bricks by
cutting off the corners of the thicker parts, as suppose c, c, c, c, at C: and you have now
a series of square piers connected by a wall veil, which, on less space and with less materials,
will do the work of the wall at A perfectly well.

§ III. I do not say how much may be cut away in the corners c, c,--that is a mathematical question
with which we need not trouble ourselves: all that we need know is, that out of every slice
we take from the "b's" and put on at the "a's," we may keep a certain percentage of room and
bricks, until, supposing that we do not want the wall veil for its own sake, this latter is
thinned entirely away, like the girdle of the Lady of Avenel, and finally breaks, and we have
nothing but a row of square piers, D.

§ IV. But have we yet arrived at the form which will spare most room, and use fewest materials.
No; and to get farther we must apply the general principle to our wall, which is equally true
in morals and mathematics, that the strength of materials, or of men, or of minds, is always
most available when it is applied as closely as possible to a single point.

Let the point to which we wish the strength of our square piers to be applied, be chosen. Then
we shall of course put them directly under it, and the point will be in their centre. But now
some of their materials are not so near or close to this point as others. Those at the corners
are farther off than the rest.

Now, if every particle of the pier be brought as near as possible to the centre of it, the
form it assumes is the circle.

The circle must be, therefore, the best possible form of plan for a pier, from the beginning
of time to the end of it. A circular pier is called a pillar or column, and all good architecture
adapted to vertical support is made up of pillars, has always been so, and must ever be so,
as long as the laws of the universe hold.

The final condition is represented at E, in its relation to that at D. It will be observed
that though each circle projects a little beyond the side of the square out of which it is
formed, the space cut off at the angles is greater than that added at the sides; for, having
our materials in a more concentrated arrangement, we can afford to part with some of them in
this last transformation, as in all the rest.

§ V. And now, what have the base and the cornice of the wall been doing while we have been
cutting the veil to pieces and gathering it together?

The base is also cut to pieces, gathered together, and becomes the base of the column.

The cornice is cut to pieces, gathered together, and becomes the capital of the column. Do
not be alarmed at the new word, it does not mean a new thing; a capital is only the cornice
of a column, and you may, if you like, call a cornice the capital of a wall.

We have now, therefore, to examine these three concentrated forms of the base, veil, and cornice:
first, the concentrated base, still called the BASE of the column; then the concentrated veil,
called the SHAFT of the column; then the concentrated cornice, called the CAPITAL of the column.

And first the Base:--

§ VI. Look back to the main type, Fig. II., page 55, and apply its profiles in due proportion
to the feet of the pillars at E in Fig. IX. p. 72: If each step in Fig. II. were gathered accurately,
the projection of the entire circular base would be less in proportion to its height than it
is in Fig. II.; but the approximation to the result in Fig. X. is quite accurate enough for
our purposes. (I pray the reader to observe that I have not made the smallest change, except
this necessary expression of a reduction in diameter, in Fig. II. as it is applied in Fig.
X., only I have not drawn the joints of the stones because these would confuse the outlines
of the bases; and I have not represented the rounding of the shafts, because it does not bear
at present on the argument.) Now it would hardly be convenient, if we had to pass between the
pillars, to have to squeeze ourselves through one of those angular gaps or brêches de Roland
in Fig. X. Our first impulse would be to cut them open; but we cannot do this, or our piers
are unsafe. We have but one other resource, to fill them up until we have a floor wide enough
to let us pass easily: this we may perhaps obtain at the first ledge, we are nearly sure to
get it at the second, and we may then obtain access to the raised interval, either by raising
the earth over the lower courses of foundation, or by steps round the entire building.

Fig. XI. is the arrangement of Fig. X. so treated.

§ VII. But suppose the pillars are so vast that the lowest chink in Fig. X. would be quite
wide enough to let us pass through it. Is there then any reason for filling it up? Yes. It
will be remembered that in Chap. IV. § VIII. the chief reason for the wide foundation of the
wall was stated to be "that it might equalise its pressure over a large surface;" but when
the foundation is cut to pieces as in Fig. X., the pressure is thrown on a succession of narrowed
and detached spaces of that surface. If the ground is in some places more disposed to yield
than in others, the piers in those places will sink more than the rest, and this distortion
of the system will be probably of more importance in pillars than in a wall, because the adjustment
of the weight above is more delicate; we thus actually want the weight of the stones between
the pillars, in order that the whole foundation may be bonded into one, and sink together if
it sink at all: and the more massy the pillars, the more we shall need to fill the intervals
of their foundations. In the best form of Greek architecture, the intervals are filled up to
the root of the shaft, and the columns have no independent base; they stand on the even floor
of their foundation.

§ VIII. Such a structure is not only admissible, but, when the column is of great thickness
in proportion to its height, and the sufficient firmness, either of the ground or prepared
floor, is evident, it is the best of all, having a strange dignity in its excessive simplicity.
It is, or ought to be, connected in our minds with the deep meaning of primeval memorial. "And
Jacob took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar." I do not
fancy that he put a base for it first. If you try to put a base to the rock-piers of Stonehenge,
you will hardly find them improved; and two of the most perfect buildings in the world, the
Parthenon and Ducal palace of Venice, have no bases to their pillars: the latter has them,
indeed, to its upper arcade shafts; and had once, it is said, a continuous raised base for
its lower ones: but successive elevations of St. Mark's Place have covered this base, and parts
of the shafts themselves, with an inundation of paving stones; and yet the building is, I doubt
not, as grand as ever. Finally, the two most noble pillars in Venice, those brought from Acre,
stand on the smooth marble surface of the Piazzetta, with no independent bases whatever. They
are rather broken away beneath, so that you may look under parts of them, and stand (not quite
erect, but leaning somewhat) safe by their own massy weight. Nor could any bases possibly be
devised that would not spoil them.

§ IX. But it is otherwise if the pillar be so slender as to look doubtfully balanced. It would
indeed stand quite as safely without an independent base as it would with one (at least, unless
the base be in the form of a socket). But it will not appear so safe to the eye. And here for
the first time, I have to express and apply a principle, which I believe the reader will at
once grant,--that features necessary to express security to the imagination, are often as essential
parts of good architecture as those required for security itself. It was said that the wall
base was the foot or paw of the wall. Exactly in the same way, and with clearer analogy, the
pier base is the foot or paw of the pier. Let us, then, take a hint from nature. A foot has
two offices, to bear up, and to hold firm. As far as it has to bear up, it is uncloven, with
slight projection,--look at an elephant's (the Doric base of animality);[36] but as far as
it has to hold firm, it is divided and clawed, with wide projections,--look at an eagle's.

§ X. Now observe. In proportion to the massiness of the column, we require its foot to express
merely the power of bearing up; in fact, it can do without a foot, like the Squire in Chevy
Chase, if the ground only be hard enough. But if the column be slender, and look as if it might
lose its balance, we require it to look as if it had hold of the ground, or the ground hold
of it, it does not matter which,--some expression of claw, prop, or socket. Now let us go back
to Fig. XI., and take up one of the bases there, in the state in which we left it. We may leave
out the two lower steps (with which we have nothing more to do, as they have become the united
floor or foundation of the whole), and, for the sake of greater clearness, I shall not draw
the bricks in the shaft, nor the flat stone which carries them, though the reader is to suppose
them remaining as drawn in Fig. XI.; but I shall only draw the shaft and its two essential
members of base, Xb and Yb, as explained at p. 65, above: and now, expressing the rounding
of these numbers on a somewhat larger scale, we have the profile a, Fig. XII.; b, the perspective
appearance of such a base seen from above; and c, the plan of it.

§ XI. Now I am quite sure the reader is not satisfied of the stability of this form as it is
seen at b; nor would he ever be so with the main contour of a circular base. Observe, we have
taken some trouble to reduce the member Yb into this round form, and all that we have gained
by so doing, is this unsatisfactory and unstable look of the base; of which the chief reason
is, that a circle, unless enclosed by right lines, has never an appearance of fixture, or definite
place,[37]--we suspect it of motion, like an orb of heaven; and the second is, that the whole
base, considered as the foot of the shaft, has no grasp nor hold: it is a club-foot, and looks
too blunt for the limb,--it wants at least expansion, if not division.

§ XII. Suppose, then, instead of taking so much trouble with the member Yb, we save time and
labor, and leave it a square block. Xb must, however, evidently follow the pillar, as its condition
is that it slope to the very base of the wall veil, and of whatever the wall veil becomes.
So the corners of Yb will project beyond the circle of Xb, and we shall have (Fig. XII.) the
profile d, the perspective appearance e, and the plan f. I am quite sure the reader likes e
much better than he did b. The circle is now placed, and we are not afraid of its rolling away.
The foot has greater expansion, and we have saved labor besides, with little loss of space,
for the interval between the bases is just as great as it was before,--we have only filled
up the corners of the squares.

But is it not possible to mend the form still further? There is surely still an appearance
of separation between Xb and Yb, as if the one might slip off the other. The foot is expanded
enough; but it needs some expression of grasp as well. It has no toes. Suppose we were to put
a spur or prop to Xb at each corner, so as to hold it fast in the centre of Yb. We will do
this in the simplest possible form. We will have the spur, or small buttress, sloping straight
from the corner of Yb up to the top of Xb, and as seen from above, of the shape of a triangle.
Applying such spurs in Fig. XII., we have the diagonal profile at g, the perspective h, and
the plan i.

§ XIII. I am quite sure the reader likes this last base the best, and feels as if it were the
firmest. But he must carefully distinguish between this feeling or imagination of the eye,
and the real stability of the structure. That this real stability has been slightly increased
by the changes between b and h, in Fig. XII., is true. There is in the base h somewhat less
chance of accidental dislocation, and somewhat greater solidity and weight. But this very slight
gain of security is of no importance whatever when compared with the general requirements of
the structure. The pillar must be perfectly secure, and more than secure, with the base b,
or the building will be unsafe, whatever other base you put to the pillar. The changes are
made, not for the sake of the almost inappreciable increase of security they involve, but in
order to convince the eye of the real security which the base b appears to compromise. This
is especially the case with regard to the props or spurs, which are absolutely useless in reality,
but are of the highest importance as an expression of safety. And this will farther appear
when we observe that they have been above quite arbitrarily supposed to be of a triangular
form. Why triangular? Why should not the spur be made wider and stronger, so as to occupy the
whole width of the angle of the square, and to become a complete expansion of Xb to the edge
of the square? Simply because, whatever its width, it has, in reality, no supporting power
whatever; and the expression of support is greatest where it assumes a form approximating to
that of the spur or claw of an animal. We shall, however, find hereafter, that it ought indeed
to be much wider than it is in Fig. XII., where it is narrowed in order to make its structure
clearly intelligible.

§ XIV. If the reader chooses to consider this spur as an æsthetic feature altogether, he is
at liberty to do so, and to transfer what we have here said of it to the beginning of Chap.
XXV. I think that its true place is here, as an expression of safety, and not a means of beauty;
but I will assume only, as established, the form e of Fig. XII., which is absolutely, as a
construction, easier, stronger, and more perfect than b. A word or two now of its materials.
The wall base, it will be remembered, was built of stones more neatly cut as they were higher
in place; and the members, Y and X, of the pier base, were the highest members of the wall
base gathered. But, exactly in proportion to this gathering or concentration in form, should,
if possible, be the gathering or concentration of substance. For as the whole weight of the
building is now to rest upon few and limited spaces, it is of the greater importance that it
should be there received by solid masonry. Xb and Yb are therefore, if possible, to be each
of a single stone; or, when the shaft is small, both cut out of one block, and especially if
spurs are to be added to Xb. The reader must not be angry with me for stating things so self-evident,
for these are all necessary steps in the chain of argument which I must not break. Even this
change from detached stones to a single block is not without significance; for it is part of
the real service and value of the member Yb to provide for the reception of the shaft a surface
free from joints; and the eye always conceives it as a firm covering over all inequalities
or fissures in the smaller masonry of the floor.

§ XV. I have said nothing yet of the proportion of the height of Yb to its width, nor of that
of Yb and Xb to each other. Both depend much on the height of shaft, and are besides variable
within certain limits, at the architect's discretion. But the limits of the height of Yb may
be thus generally stated. If it looks so thin as that the weight of the column above might
break it, it is too low; and if it is higher than its own width, it is too high. The utmost
admissible height is that of a cubic block; for if it ever become higher than it is wide, it
becomes itself a part of a pier, and not the base of one.

§ XVI. I have also supposed Yb, when expanded from beneath Xb, as always expanded into a square,
and four spurs only to be added at the angles. But Yb may be expanded into a pentagon, hexagon,
or polygon; and Xb then may have five, six, or many spurs. In proportion, however, as the sides
increase in number, the spurs become shorter and less energetic in their effect, and the square
is in most cases the best form.

§ XVII. We have hitherto conducted the argument entirely on the supposition of the pillars
being numerous, and in a range. Suppose, however, that we require only a single pillar: as
we have free space round it, there is no need to fill up the first ranges of its foundations;
nor need we do so in order to equalise pressure, since the pressure to be met is its own alone.
Under such circumstances, it is well to exhibit the lower tiers of the foundation as well as
Yb and Xb. The noble bases of the two granite pillars of the Piazzetta at Venice are formed
by the entire series of members given in Fig. X., the lower courses expanding into steps, with
a superb breadth of proportion to the shaft. The member Xb is of course circular, having its
proper decorative mouldings, not here considered; Yb is octagonal, but filled up into a square
by certain curious groups of figures representing the trades of Venice. The three courses below
are octagonal, with their sides set across the angles of the innermost octagon, Yb. The shafts
are 15 feet in circumference, and the lowest octagons of the base 56 (7 feet each side).

§ XVIII. Detached buildings, like our own Monument, are not pillars, but towers built in imitation
of Pillars. As towers they are barbarous, being dark, inconvenient, and unsafe, besides lying,
and pretending to be what they are not. As shafts they are barbarous, because they were designed
at a time when the Renaissance architects had introduced and forced into acceptance, as de
rigueur, a kind of columnar high-heeled shoe,--a thing which they called a pedestal, and which
is to a true base exactly what a Greek actor's cothurnus was to a Greek gentleman's sandal.
But the Greek actor knew better, I believe, than to exhibit or to decorate his cork sole; and,
with shafts as with heroes, it is rather better to put the sandal off than the cothurnus on.
There are, indeed, occasions on which a pedestal may be necessary; it may be better to raise
a shaft from a sudden depression of plinth to a level with others, its companions, by means
of a pedestal, than to introduce a higher shaft; or it may be better to place a shaft of alabaster,
if otherwise too short for our purpose, on a pedestal, than to use a larger shaft of coarser
material; but the pedestal is in each case a make-shift, not an additional perfection. It may,
in the like manner, be sometimes convenient for men to walk on stilts, but not to keep their
stilts on as ornamental parts of dress. The bases of the Nelson Column, the Monument, and the
column of the Place Vendôme, are to the shafts, exactly what highly ornamented wooden legs
would be to human beings.

§ XIX. So far of bases of detached shafts. As we do not yet know in what manner shafts are
likely to be grouped, we can say nothing of those of grouped shafts until we know more of what
they are to support.

Lastly; we have throughout our reasoning upon the base supposed the pier to be circular. But
circumstances may occur to prevent its being reduced to this form, and it may remain square
or rectangular; its base will then be simply the wall base following its contour, and we have
no spurs at the angles. Thus much may serve respecting pier bases; we have next to examine
the concentration of the Wall Veil, or the Shaft.

FOOTNOTES:

  [35] The experiment is not quite fair in this rude fashion; for the
    small rolls owe their increase of strength much more to their
    tubular form than their aggregation of material; but if the paper be
    cut up into small strips, and tied together firmly in three or four
    compact bundles, it will exhibit increase of strength enough to show
    the principle. Vide, however, Appendix 16, "Strength of Shafts."

CHAPTER VIII.

  THE SHAFT.

§ I. We have seen in the last Chapter how, in converting the wall into the square or cylindrical
shaft, we parted at every change of form with some quantity of material. In proportion to the
quantity thus surrendered, is the necessity that what we retain should be good of its kind,
and well set together, since everything now depends on it.

It is clear also that the best material, and the closest concentration, is that of the natural
crystalline rocks; and that, by having reduced our wall into the shape of shafts, we may be
enabled to avail ourselves of this better material, and to exchange cemented bricks for crystallised
blocks of stone. Therefore, the general idea of a perfect shaft is that of a single stone hewn
into a form more or less elongated and cylindrical. Under this form, or at least under the
ruder one of a long stone set upright, the conception of true shafts appears first to have
occurred to the human mind; for the reader must note this carefully, once for all, it does
not in the least follow that the order of architectural features which is most reasonable in
their arrangement, is most probable in their invention. I have theoretically deduced shafts
from walls, but shafts were never so reasoned out in architectural practice. The man who first
propped a thatched roof with poles was the discoverer of their principle; and he who first
hewed a long stone into a cylinder, the perfecter of their practice.

§ II. It is clearly necessary that shafts of this kind (we will call them, for convenience,
block shafts) should be composed of stone not liable to flaws or fissures; and therefore that
we must no longer continue our argument as if it were always possible to do what is to be done
in the best way; for the style of a national architecture may evidently depend, in great measure,
upon the nature of the rocks of the country.

Our own English rocks, which supply excellent building stone from their thin and easily divisible
beds, are for the most part entirely incapable of being worked into shafts of any size, except
only the granites and whinstones, whose hardness renders them intractable for ordinary purposes;--and
English architecture therefore supplies no instances of the block shaft applied on an extensive
scale; while the facility of obtaining large masses of marble has in Greece and Italy been
partly the cause of the adoption of certain noble types of architectural form peculiar to those
countries, or, when occurring elsewhere, derived from them.

We have not, however, in reducing our walls to shafts, calculated on the probabilities of our
obtaining better materials than those of which the walls were built; and we shall therefore
first consider the form of shaft which will be best when we have the best materials; and then
consider how far we can imitate, or how far it will be wise to imitate, this form with any
materials we can obtain.

§ III. Now as I gave the reader the ground, and the stones, that he might for himself find
out how to build his wall, I shall give him the block of marble, and the chisel, that he may
himself find out how to shape his column. Let him suppose the elongated mass, so given him,
rudely hewn to the thickness which he has calculated will be proportioned to the weight it
has to carry. The conditions of stability will require that some allowance be made in finishing
it for any chance of slight disturbance or subsidence of the ground below, and that, as everything
must depend on the uprightness of the shaft, as little chance should be left as possible of
its being thrown off its balance. It will therefore be prudent to leave it slightly thicker
at the base than at the top. This excess of diameter at the base being determined, the reader
is to ask himself how most easily and simply to smooth the column from one extremity to the
other. To cut it into a true straight-sided cone would be a matter of much trouble and nicety,
and would incur the continual risk of chipping into it too deep. Why not leave some room for
a chance stroke, work it slightly, very slightly convex, and smooth the curve by the eye between
the two extremities? you will save much trouble and time, and the shaft will be all the stronger.

This is accordingly the natural form of a detached block shaft. It is the best. No other will
ever be so agreeable to the mind or eye. I do not mean that it is not capable of more refined
execution, or of the application of some of the laws of æsthetic beauty, but that it is the
best recipient of execution and subject of law; better in either case than if you had taken
more pains, and cut it straight.

§ IV. You will observe, however, that the convexity is to be very slight, and that the shaft
is not to bulge in the centre, but to taper from the root in a curved line; the peculiar character
of the curve you will discern better by exaggerating, in a diagram, the conditions of its sculpture.

Let a, a, b, b, at A, Fig. XIII., be the rough block of the shaft, laid on the ground; and
as thick as you can by any chance require it to be; you will leave it of this full thickness
at its base at A, but at the other end you will mark off upon it the diameter c, d, which you
intend it to have at the summit; you will then take your mallet and chisel, and working from
c and d you will roughly knock off the corners, shaded in the figure, so as to reduce the shaft
to the figure described by the inside lines in A and the outside lines in B; you then proceed
to smooth it, you chisel away the shaded parts in B, and leave your finished shaft of the form
of the inside lines e, g, f, h.

The result of this operation will be of course that the shaft tapers faster towards the top
than it does near the ground. Observe this carefully; it is a point of great future importance.

§ V. So far of the shape of detached or block shafts. We can carry the type no farther on merely
structural considerations: let us pass to the shaft of inferior materials.

Unfortunately, in practice, this step must be soon made. It is alike difficult to obtain, transport,
and raise, block shafts more than ten or twelve feet long, except in remarkable positions,
and as pieces of singular magnificence. Large pillars are therefore always composed of more
than one block of stone. Such pillars are either jointed like basalt columns, and composed
of solid pieces of stone set one above another; or they are filled up towers, built of small
stones cemented into a mass, with more or less of regularity: Keep this distinction carefully
in mind, it is of great importance; for the jointed column, every stone composing which, however
thin, is (so to speak) a complete slice of the shaft, is just as strong as the block pillar
of one stone, so long as no forces are brought into action upon it which would have a tendency
to cause horizontal dislocation. But the pillar which is built as a filled-up tower is of course
liable to fissure in any direction, if its cement give way.

But, in either case, it is evident that all constructive reason of the curved contour is at
once destroyed. Far from being an easy or natural procedure, the fitting of each portion of
the curve to its fellow, in the separate stones, would require painful care and considerable
masonic skill; while, in the case of the filled-up tower, the curve outwards would be even
unsafe; for its greatest strength (and that the more in proportion to its careless building)
lies in its bark, or shell of outside stone; and this, if curved outwards, would at once burst
outwards, if heavily loaded above.

If, therefore, the curved outline be ever retained in such shafts, it must be in obedience
to æsthetic laws only.

§ VI. But farther. Not only the curvature, but even the tapering by straight lines, would be
somewhat difficult of execution in the pieced column. Where, indeed, the entire shaft is composed
of four or five blocks set one upon another, the diameters may be easily determined at the
successive joints, and the stones chiselled to the same slope. But this becomes sufficiently
troublesome when the joints are numerous, so that the pillar is like a pile of cheeses; or
when it is to be built of small and irregular stones. We should be naturally led, in the one
case, to cut all the cheeses to the same diameter; in the other to build by the plumb-line;
and in both to give up the tapering altogether.

§ VII. Farther. Since the chance, in the one case, of horizontal dislocation, in the other,
of irregular fissure, is much increased by the composition of the shaft out of joints or small
stones, a larger bulk of shaft is required to carry the given weight; and, cæteris paribus,
jointed and cemented shafts must be thicker in proportion to the weight they carry than those
which are of one block.

We have here evidently natural causes of a very marked division in schools of architecture:
one group composed of buildings whose shafts are either of a single stone or of few joints;
the shafts, therefore, being gracefully tapered, and reduced by successive experiments to the
narrowest possible diameter proportioned to the weight they carry: and the other group embracing
those buildings whose shafts are of many joints or of small stones; shafts which are therefore
not tapered, and rather thick and ponderous in proportion to the weight they carry; the latter
school being evidently somewhat imperfect and inelegant as compared with the former.

It may perhaps appear, also, that this arrangement of the materials in cylindrical shafts at
all would hardly have suggested itself to a people who possessed no large blocks out of which
to hew them; and that the shaft built of many pieces is probably derived from, and imitative
of the shaft hewn from few or from one.

§ VIII. If, therefore, you take a good geological map of Europe, and lay your finger upon the
spots where volcanic influences supply either travertin or marble in accessible and available
masses, you will probably mark the points where the types of the first school have been originated
and developed. If, in the next place, you will mark the districts where broken and rugged basalt
or whinstone, or slaty sandstone, supply materials on easier terms indeed, but fragmentary
and unmanageable, you will probably distinguish some of the birthplaces of the derivative and
less graceful school. You will, in the first case, lay your finger on Pæstum, Agrigentum, and
Athens; in the second, on Durham and Lindisfarne.

The shafts of the great primal school are, indeed, in their first form, as massy as those of
the other, and the tendency of both is to continual diminution of their diameters: but in the
first school it is a true diminution in the thickness of the independent pier; in the last,
it is an apparent diminution, obtained by giving it the appearance of a group of minor piers.
The distinction, however, with which we are concerned is not that of slenderness, but of vertical
or curved contour; and we may note generally that while throughout the whole range of Northern
work, the perpendicular shaft appears in continually clearer development, throughout every
group which has inherited the spirit of the Greek, the shaft retains its curved or tapered
form; and the occurrence of the vertical detached shaft may at all times, in European architecture,
be regarded as one of the most important collateral evidences of Northern influence.

§ IX. It is necessary to limit this observation to European architecture, because the Egyptian
shaft is often untapered, like the Northern. It appears that the Central Southern, or Greek
shaft, was tapered or curved on æsthetic rather than constructive principles; and the Egyptian
which precedes, and the Northern which follows it, are both vertical, the one because the best
form had not been discovered, the other because it could not be attained. Both are in a certain
degree barbaric; and both possess in combination and in their ornaments a power altogether
different from that of the Greek shaft, and at least as impressive if not as admirable.

§ X. We have hitherto spoken of shafts as if their number were fixed, and only their diameter
variable according to the weight to be borne. But this supposition is evidently gratuitous;
for the same weight may be carried either by many and slender, or by few and massy shafts.
If the reader will look back to Fig. IX., he will find the number of shafts into which the
wall was reduced to be dependent altogether upon the length of the spaces a, b, a, b, &c.,
a length which was arbitrarily fixed. We are at liberty to make these spaces of what length
we choose, and, in so doing, to increase the number and diminish the diameter of the shafts,
or vice versâ.

§ XI. Supposing the materials are in each case to be of the same kind, the choice is in great
part at the architect's discretion, only there is a limit on the one hand to the multiplication
of the slender shaft, in the inconvenience of the narrowed interval, and on the other, to the
enlargement of the massy shaft, in the loss of breadth to the building.[38] That will be commonly
the best proportion which is a natural mean between the two limits; leaning to the side of
grace or of grandeur according to the expressional intention of the work. I say, commonly the
best, because, in some cases, this expressional invention may prevail over all other considerations,
and a column of unnecessary bulk or fantastic slightness be adopted in order to strike the
spectator with awe or with surprise.[39] The architect is, however, rarely in practice compelled
to use one kind of material only; and his choice lies frequently between the employment of
a larger number of solid and perfect small shafts, or a less number of pieced and cemented
large ones. It is often possible to obtain from quarries near at hand, blocks which might be
cut into shafts eight or twelve feet long and four or five feet round, when larger shafts can
only be obtained in distant localities; and the question then is between the perfection of
smaller features and the imperfection of larger. We shall find numberless instances in Italy
in which the first choice has been boldly, and I think most wisely made; and magnificent buildings
have been composed of systems of small but perfect shafts, multiplied and superimposed. So
long as the idea of the symmetry of a perfect shaft remained in the builder's mind, his choice
could hardly be directed otherwise, and the adoption of the built and tower-like shaft appears
to have been the result of a loss of this sense of symmetry consequent on the employment of
intractable materials.

§ XII. But farther: we have up to this point spoken of shafts as always set in ranges, and
at equal intervals from each other. But there is no necessity for this; and material differences
may be made in their diameters if two or more be grouped so as to do together the work of one
large one, and that within, or nearly within, the space which the larger one would have occupied.

§ XIII. Let A, B, C, Fig. XIV., be three surfaces, of which B and C contain equal areas, and
each of them double that of A: then supposing them all loaded to the same height, B or C would
receive twice as much weight as A; therefore, to carry B or C loaded, we should need a shaft
of twice the strength needed to carry A. Let S be the shaft required to carry A, and S2 the
shaft required to carry B or C; then S3 may be divided into two shafts, or S2 into four shafts,
as at S3, all equal in area or solid contents;[40] and the mass A might be carried safely by
two of them, and the masses B and C, each by four of them.

Now if we put the single shafts each under the centre of the mass they have to bear, as represented
by the shaded circles at a, a2, a3, the masses A and C are both of them very ill supported,
and even B insufficiently; but apply the four and the two shafts as at b, b2, b3, and they
are supported satisfactorily. Let the weight on each of the masses be doubled, and the shafts
doubled in area, then we shall have such arrangements as those at c, c2, c3; and if again the
shafts and weight be doubled, we shall have d, d2, d3.

§ XIV. Now it will at once be observed that the arrangement of the shafts in the series of
B and C is always exactly the same in their relations to each other; only the group of B is
set evenly, and the group of C is set obliquely,--the one carrying a square, the other a cross.

You have in these two series the primal representations of shaft arrangement in the Southern
and Northern schools; while the group b, of which b2 is the double, set evenly, and c2 the
double, set obliquely, is common to both. The reader will be surprised to find how all the
complex and varied forms of shaft arrangement will range themselves into one or other of these
groups; and still more surprised to find the oblique or cross set system on the one hand, and
the square set system on the other, severally distinctive of Southern and Northern work. The
dome of St. Mark's, and the crossing of the nave and transepts of Beauvais, are both carried
by square piers; but the piers of St. Mark's are set square to the walls of the church, and
those of Beauvais obliquely to them: and this difference is even a more essential one than
that between the smooth surface of the one and the reedy complication of the other. The two
squares here in the margin (Fig. XV.) are exactly of the same size, but their expression is
altogether different, and in that difference lies one of the most subtle distinctions between
the Gothic and Greek spirit,--from the shaft, which bears the building, to the smallest decoration.
The Greek square is by preference set evenly, the Gothic square obliquely; and that so constantly,
that wherever we find the level or even square occurring as a prevailing form, either in plan
or decoration, in early northern work, there we may at least suspect the presence of a southern
or Greek influence; and, on the other hand, wherever the oblique square is prominent in the
south, we may confidently look for farther evidence of the influence of the Gothic architects.
The rule must not of course be pressed far when, in either school, there has been determined
search for every possible variety of decorative figures; and accidental circumstances may reverse
the usual system in special cases; but the evidence drawn from this character is collaterally
of the highest value, and the tracing it out is a pursuit of singular interest. Thus, the Pisan
Romanesque might in an instant be pronounced to have been formed under some measure of Lombardic
influence, from the oblique squares set under its arches; and in it we have the spirit of northern
Gothic affecting details of the southern;--obliquity of square, in magnificently shafted Romanesque.
At Monza, on the other hand, the levelled square is the characteristic figure of the entire
decoration of the façade of the Duomo, eminently giving it southern character; but the details
are derived almost entirely from the northern Gothic. Here then we have southern spirit and
northern detail. Of the cruciform outline of the load of the shaft, a still more positive test
of northern work, we shall have more to say in the 28th Chapter; we must at present note certain
farther changes in the form of the grouped shaft, which open the way to every branch of its
endless combinations, southern or northern.

§ XV. 1. If the group at d3, Fig. XIV., be taken from under its loading, and have its centre
filled up, it will become a quatrefoil; and it will represent, in their form of most frequent
occurrence, a family of shafts, whose plans are foiled figures, trefoils, quatrefoils, cinquefoils,
&c.; of which a trefoiled example, from the Frari at Venice, is the third in Plate II., and
a quatrefoil from Salisbury the eighth. It is rare, however, to find in Gothic architecture
shafts of this family composed of a large number of foils, because multifoiled shafts are seldom
true grouped shafts, but are rather canaliculated conditions of massy piers. The representatives
of this family may be considered as the quatrefoil on the Gothic side of the Alps; and the
Egyptian multifoiled shaft on the south, approximating to the general type, b, Fig. XVI.

§ XVI. Exactly opposed to this great family is that of shafts which have concave curves instead
of convex on each of their sides; but these are not, properly speaking, grouped shafts at all,
and their proper place is among decorated piers; only they must be named here in order to mark
their exact opposition to the foiled system. In their simplest form, represented by c, Fig.
XVI., they have no representatives in good architecture, being evidently weak and meagre; but
approximations to them exist in late Gothic, as in the vile cathedral of Orleans, and in modern
cast-iron shafts. In their fully developed form they are the Greek Doric, a, Fig. XVI., and
occur in caprices of the Romanesque and Italian Gothic: d, Fig. XVI., is from the Duomo of Monza.

§ XVII. 2. Between c3 and d3 of Fig. XIV. there may be evidently another condition, represented
at 6, Plate II., and formed by the insertion of a central shaft within the four external ones.
This central shaft we may suppose to expand in proportion to the weight it has to carry. If
the external shafts expand in the same proportion, the entire form remains unchanged; but if
they do not expand, they may (1) be pushed out by the expanding shaft, or (2) be gradually
swallowed up in its expansion, as at 4, Plate II. If they are pushed out, they are removed
farther from each other by every increase of the central shaft; and others may then be introduced
in the vacant spaces; giving, on the plan, a central orb with an ever increasing host of satellites,
10, Plate II.; the satellites themselves often varying in size, and perhaps quitting contact
with the central shaft. Suppose them in any of their conditions fixed, while the inner shaft
expands, and they will be gradually buried in it, forming more complicated conditions of 4,
Plate II. The combinations are thus altogether infinite, even supposing the central shaft to
be circular only; but their infinity is multiplied by many other infinities when the central
shaft itself becomes square or crosslet on the section, or itself multifoiled (8, Plate II.)
with satellite shafts eddying about its recesses and angles, in every possible relation of
attraction. Among these endless conditions of change, the choice of the architect is free,
this only being generally noted: that, as the whole value of such piers depends, first, upon
their being wisely fitted to the weight above them, and, secondly, upon their all working together:
and one not failing the rest, perhaps to the ruin of all, he must never multiply shafts without
visible cause in the disposition of members superimposed:[41] and in his multiplied group he
should, if possible, avoid a marked separation between the large central shaft and its satellites;
for if this exist, the satellites will either appear useless altogether, or else, which is
worse, they will look as if they were meant to keep the central shaft together by wiring or
caging it in; like iron rods set round a supple cylinder,--a fatal fault in the piers of Westminster
Abbey, and, in a less degree, in the noble nave of the cathedral of Bourges.

§ XVIII. While, however, we have been thus subdividing or assembling our shafts, how far has
it been possible to retain their curved or tapered outline? So long as they remain distinct
and equal, however close to each other, the independent curvature may evidently be retained.
But when once they come in contact, it is equally evident that a column, formed of shafts touching
at the base and separate at the top, would appear as if in the very act of splitting asunder.
Hence, in all the closely arranged groups, and especially those with a central shaft, the tapering
is sacrificed; and with less cause for regret, because it was a provision against subsidence
or distortion, which cannot now take place with the separate members of the group. Evidently,
the work, if safe at all, must be executed with far greater accuracy and stability when its
supports are so delicately arranged, than would be implied by such precaution. In grouping
shafts, therefore, a true perpendicular line is, in nearly all cases, given to the pier; and
the reader will anticipate that the two schools, which we have already found to be distinguished,
the one by its perpendicular and pieced shafts, and the other by its curved and block shafts,
will be found divided also in their employment of grouped shafts;--it is likely that the idea
of grouping, however suggested, will be fully entertained and acted upon by the one, but hesitatingly
by the other; and that we shall find, on the one hand, buildings displaying sometimes massy
piers of small stones, sometimes clustered piers of rich complexity, and on the other, more
or less regular succession of block shafts, each treated as entirely independent of those around
it.

§ XIX. Farther, the grouping of shafts once admitted, it is probable that the complexity and
richness of such arrangements would recommend them to the eye, and induce their frequent, even
their unnecessary introduction; so that weight which might have been borne by a single pillar,
would be in preference supported by four or five. And if the stone of the country, whose fragmentary
character first occasioned the building and piecing of the large pier, were yet in beds consistent
enough to supply shafts of very small diameter, the strength and simplicity of such a construction
might justify it, as well as its grace. The fact, however, is that the charm which the multiplication
of line possesses for the eye has always been one of the chief ends of the work in the grouped
schools; and that, so far from employing the grouped piers in order to the introduction of
very slender block shafts, the most common form in which such piers occur is that of a solid
jointed shaft, each joint being separately cut into the contour of the group required.

§ XX. We have hitherto supposed that all grouped or clustered shafts have been the result or
the expression of an actual gathering and binding together of detached shafts. This is not,
however, always so: for some clustered shafts are little more than solid piers channelled on
the surface, and their form appears to be merely the development of some longitudinal furrowing
or striation on the original single shaft. That clustering or striation, whichever we choose
to call it, is in this case a decorative feature, and to be considered under the head of decoration.

§ XXI. It must be evident to the reader at a glance, that the real serviceableness of any of
these grouped arrangements must depend upon the relative shortness of the shafts, and that,
when the whole pier is so lofty that its minor members become mere reeds or rods of stone,
those minor members can no longer be charged with any considerable weight. And the fact is,
that in the most complicated Gothic arrangements, when the pier is tall and its satellites
stand clear of it, no real work is given them to do, and they might all be removed without
endangering the building. They are merely the expression of a great consistent system, and
are in architecture what is often found in animal anatomy,--a bone, or process of a bone, useless,
under the ordained circumstances of its life, to the particular animal in which it is found,
and slightly developed, but yet distinctly existent, and representing, for the sake of absolute
consistency, the same bone in its appointed, and generally useful, place, either in skeletons
of all animals, or in the genus to which the animal itself belongs.

§ XXII. Farther: as it is not easy to obtain pieces of stone long enough for these supplementary
shafts (especially as it is always unsafe to lay a stratified stone with its beds upright)
they have been frequently composed of two or more short shafts set upon each other, and to
conceal the unsightly junction, a flat stone has been interposed, carved into certain mouldings,
which have the appearance of a ring on the shaft. Now observe: the whole pier was the gathering
of the whole wall, the base gathers into base, the veil into the shaft, and the string courses
of the veil gather into these rings; and when this is clearly expressed, and the rings do indeed
correspond with the string courses of the wall veil, they are perfectly admissible and even
beautiful; but otherwise, and occurring, as they do in the shafts of Westminster, in the middle
of continuous lines, they are but sorry make-shifts, and of late since gas has been invented,
have become especially offensive from their unlucky resemblance to the joints of gas-pipes,
or common water-pipes. There are two leaden ones, for instance, on the left hand as one enters
the abbey at Poet's Corner, with their solderings and funnels looking exactly like rings and
capitals, and most disrespectfully mimicking the shafts of the abbey, inside.

Thus far we have traced the probable conditions of shaft structure in pure theory; I shall
now lay before the reader a brief statement of the facts of the thing in time past and present.

§ XXIII. In the earliest and grandest shaft architecture which we know, that of Egypt, we have
no grouped arrangements, properly so called, but either single and smooth shafts, or richly
reeded and furrowed shafts, which represent the extreme conditions of a complicated group bound
together to sustain a single mass; and are indeed, without doubt, nothing else than imitations
of bundles of reeds, or of clusters of lotus:[42] but in these shafts there is merely the idea
of a group, not the actual function or structure of a group; they are just as much solid and
simple shafts as those which are smooth, and merely by the method of their decoration present
to the eye the image of a richly complex arrangement.

§ XXIV. After these we have the Greek shaft, less in scale, and losing all suggestion or purpose
of suggestion of complexity, its so-called flutings being, visibly as actually, an external
decoration.

§ XXV. The idea of the shaft remains absolutely single in the Roman and Byzantine mind; but
true grouping begins in Christian architecture by the placing of two or more separate shafts
side by side, each having its own work to do; then three or four, still with separate work;
then, by such steps as those above theoretically pursued, the number of the members increases,
while they coagulate into a single mass; and we have finally a shaft apparently composed of
thirty, forty, fifty, or more distinct members; a shaft which, in the reality of its service,
is as much a single shaft as the old Egyptian one; but which differs from the Egyptian in that
all its members, how many soever, have each individual work to do, and a separate rib of arch
or roof to carry: and thus the great Christian truth of distinct services of the individual
soul is typified in the Christian shaft; and the old Egyptian servitude of the multitudes,
the servitude inseparable from the children of Ham, is typified also in that ancient shaft
of the Egyptians, which in its gathered strength of the river reeds, seems, as the sands of
the desert drift over its ruin, to be intended to remind us for ever of the end of the association
of the wicked. "Can the rush grow up without mire, or the flag grow without water?--So are
the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish."

§ XXVI. Let the reader then keep this distinction of the three systems clearly in his mind:
Egyptian system, an apparent cluster supporting a simple capital and single weight; Greek and
Roman system, single shaft, single weight; Gothic system, divided shafts, divided weight: at
first actually and simply divided, at last apparently and infinitely divided; so that the fully
formed Gothic shaft is a return to the Egyptian, but the weight is divided in the one and undivided
in the other.

§ XXVII. The transition from the actual to the apparent cluster, in the Gothic, is a question
of the most curious interest; I have thrown together the shaft sections in Plate II. to illustrate
it, and exemplify what has been generally stated above.[43]

1. The earliest, the most frequent, perhaps the most beautiful of all the groups, is also the
simplest; the two shafts arranged as at b or c, (Fig. XIV.) above, bearing an oblong mass,
and substituted for the still earlier structure a, Fig. XIV. In Plate XVII. (Chap. XXVII.)
are three examples of the transition: the one on the left, at the top, is the earliest single-shafted
arrangement, constant in the rough Romanesque windows; a huge hammer-shaped capital being employed
to sustain the thickness of the wall. It was rapidly superseded by the double shaft, as on
the right of it; a very early example from the cloisters of the Duomo, Verona. Beneath, is
a most elaborate and perfect one from St. Zeno of Verona, where the group is twice complicated,
two shafts being used, both with quatrefoil sections. The plain double shaft, however, is by
far the most frequent, both in the Northern and Southern Gothic, but for the most part early;
it is very frequent in cloisters, and in the singular one of St. Michael's Mount, Normandy,
a small pseudo-arcade runs along between the pairs of shafts, a miniature aisle. The group
is employed on a magnificent scale, but ill proportioned, for the main piers of the apse of
the cathedral of Coutances, its purpose being to conceal one shaft behind the other, and make
it appear to the spectator from the nave as if the apse were sustained by single shafts, of
inordinate slenderness. The attempt is ill-judged, and the result unsatisfactory.

§ XXVIII. 2. When these pairs of shafts come near each other, as frequently at the turnings
of angles (Fig. XVII.), the quadruple group results, b 2, Fig. XIV., of which the Lombardic
sculptors were excessively fond, usually tying the shafts together in their centre, in a lover's
knot. They thus occur in Plate V., from the Broletto of Como; at the angle of St. Michele of
Lucca, Plate XXI.; and in the balustrade of St. Mark's. This is a group, however, which I have
never seen used on a large scale.[44]

§ XXIX. 3. Such groups, consolidated by a small square in their centre, form the shafts of
St. Zeno, just spoken of, and figured in Plate XVII., which are among the most interesting
pieces of work I know in Italy. I give their entire arrangement in Fig. XVIII.: both shafts
have the same section, but one receives a half turn as it ascends, giving it an exquisite spiral
contour: the plan of their bases, with their plinth, is given at 2, Plate II.; and note it
carefully, for it is an epitome of all that we observed above, respecting the oblique and even
square. It was asserted that the oblique belonged to the north, the even to the south: we have
here the northern Lombardic nation naturalised in Italy, and, behold, the oblique and even
quatrefoil linked together; not confused, but actually linked by a bar of stone, as seen in
Plate XVII., under the capitals.

4. Next to these, observe the two groups of five shafts each, 5 and 6, Plate II., one oblique,
the other even. Both are from upper stories; the oblique one from the triforium of Salisbury;
the even one from the upper range of shafts in the façade of St. Mark's at Venice.[45]

§ XXX. Around these central types are grouped, in Plate II., four simple examples of the satellitic
cluster, all of the Northern Gothic: 4, from the Cathedral of Amiens; 7, from that of Lyons
(nave pier); 8, the same from Salisbury; 10, from the porch of Notre Dame, Dijon, having satellites
of three magnitudes: 9 is one of the piers between the doors of the same church, with shafts
of four magnitudes, and is an instance of the confusion of mind of the Northern architects
between piers proper and jamb mouldings (noticed farther in the next chapter, § XXXI.): for
this fig. 9, which is an angle at the meeting of two jambs, is treated like a rich independent
shaft, and the figure below, 12, which is half of a true shaft, is treated like a meeting of jambs.

All these four examples belonging to the oblique or Northern system, the curious trefoil plan,
3, lies between the two, as the double quatrefoil next it unites the two. The trefoil is from
the Frari, Venice, and has a richly worked capital in the Byzantine manner,--an imitation,
I think, of the Byzantine work by the Gothic builders: 1 is to be compared with it, being one
of the earliest conditions of the cross shaft, from the atrium of St. Ambrogio at Milan. 13
is the nave pier of St. Michele at Pavia, showing the same condition more fully developed:
and 11 another nave pier from Vienne, on the Rhone, of far more distinct Roman derivation,
for the flat pilaster is set to the nave, and is fluted like an antique one. 12 is the grandest
development I have ever seen of the cross shaft, with satellite shafts in the nooks of it:
it is half of one of the great western piers of the cathedral of Bourges, measuring eight feet
each side, thirty-two round.[46] Then the one below (15) is half of a nave pier of Rouen Cathedral,
showing the mode in which such conditions as that of Dijon (9) and that of Bourges (12) were
fused together into forms of inextricable complexity (inextricable I mean in the irregularity
of proportion and projection, for all of them are easily resolvable into simple systems in
connexion with the roof ribs). This pier of Rouen is a type of the last condition of the good
Gothic; from this point the small shafts begin to lose shape, and run into narrow fillets and
ridges, projecting at the same time farther and farther in weak tongue-like sections, as described
in the "Seven Lamps." I have only here given one example of this family, an unimportant but
sufficiently characteristic one (16) from St. Gervais of Falaise. One side of the nave of that
church is Norman, the other Flamboyant, and the two piers 14 and 16 stand opposite each other.
It would be useless to endeavor to trace farther the fantasticism of the later Gothic shafts;
they become mere aggregations of mouldings very sharply and finely cut, their bases at the
same time running together in strange complexity and their capitals diminishing and disappearing.
Some of their conditions, which, in their rich striation, resemble crystals of beryl, are very
massy and grand; others, meagre, harsh, or effeminate in themselves, are redeemed by richness
and boldness of decoration; and I have long had it in my mind to reason out the entire harmony
of this French Flamboyant system, and fix its types and possible power. But this inquiry is
foreign altogether to our present purpose, and we shall therefore turn back from the Flamboyant
to the Norman side of the Falaise aisle, resolute for the future that all shafts of which we
may have the ordering, shall be permitted, as with wisdom we may also permit men or cities,
to gather themselves into companies, or constellate themselves into clusters, but not to fuse
themselves into mere masses of nebulous aggregation.

FOOTNOTES:

  [38] In saying this, it is assumed that the interval is one which is
    to be traversed by men; and that a certain relation of the shafts
    and intervals to the size of the human figure is therefore
    necessary. When shafts are used in the upper stories of buildings,
    or on a scale which ignores all relation to the human figure, no
    such relative limits exist either to slenderness or solidity.

  [39] Vide the interesting discussion of this point in Mr.
    Fergusson's account of the Temple of Karnak, "Principles of Beauty
    in Art," p. 219.

  [40] I have assumed that the strength of similar shafts of equal
    height is as the squares of their diameters; which, though not
    actually a correct expression, is sufficiently so for all our
    present purposes.

  [41] How far this condition limits the system of shaft grouping we
    shall see presently. The reader must remember, that we at present
    reason respecting shafts in the abstract only.

    representation of the bulging out of the reeds at the top, under the
    weight of the architrave.

  [43] I have not been at the pains to draw the complicated piers in
    this plate with absolute exactitude to the scale of each: they are
    accurate enough for their purpose: those of them respecting which we
    shall have farther question will be given on a much larger scale.

  [44] The largest I remember support a monument in St. Zeno of
    Verona; they are of red marble, some ten or twelve feet high.

  [45] The effect of this last is given in Plate VI. of the folio
    series.

  [46] The entire development of this cross system in connexion with
    the vaulting ribs, has been most clearly explained by Professor
    Willis (Architecture of Mid. Ages, Chap. IV.); and I strongly
    recommend every reader who is inclined to take pains in the matter,
    to read that chapter. I have been contented, in my own text, to
    pursue the abstract idea of shaft form.

CHAPTER IX.

  THE CAPITAL.

§ I. The reader will remember that in Chap. VII. § V. it was said that the cornice of the wall,
being cut to pieces and gathered together, formed the capital of the column. We have now to
follow it in its transformation.

We must, of course, take our simplest form or root of cornices (a, in Fig. V., above). We will
take X and Y there, and we must necessarily gather them together as we did Xb and Yb in Chap.
VII. Look back to the tenth paragraph of Chap. VII., read or glance it over again, substitute
X and Y for Xb and Yb, read capital for base, and, as we said that the capital was the hand
of the pillar, while the base was its foot, read also fingers for toes; and as you look to
the plate, Fig. XII., turn it upside down. Then h, in Fig. XII., becomes now your best general
form of block capital, as before of block base.

§ II. You will thus have a perfect idea of the analogies between base and capital; our farther
inquiry is into their differences. You cannot but have noticed that when Fig. XII. is turned
upside down, the square stone (Y) looks too heavy for the supporting stone (X); and that in
the profile of cornice (a of Fig. V.) the proportions are altogether different. You will feel
the fitness of this in an instant when you consider that the principal function of the sloping
part in Fig. XII. is as a prop to the pillar to keep it from slipping aside; but the function
of the sloping stone in the cornice and capital is to carry weight above. The thrust of the
slope in the one case should therefore be lateral, in the other upwards.

§ III. We will, therefore, take the two figures, e and h of Fig. XII., and make this change
in them as we reverse them, using now the exact profile of the cornice a,--the father of cornices;
and we shall thus have a and b, Fig. XIX.

Both of these are sufficiently ugly, the reader thinks; so do I; but we will mend them before
we have done with them: that at a is assuredly the ugliest,--like a tile on a flower-pot. It
is, nevertheless, the father of capitals; being the simplest condition of the gathered father
of cornices. But it is to be observed that the diameter of the shaft here is arbitrarily assumed
to be small, in order more clearly to show the general relations of the sloping stone to the
shaft and upper stone; and this smallness of the shaft diameter is inconsistent with the serviceableness
and beauty of the arrangement at a, if it were to be realised (as we shall see presently);
but it is not inconsistent with its central character, as the representative of every species
of possible capital; nor is its tile and flower-pot look to be regretted, as it may remind
the reader of the reported origin of the Corinthian capital. The stones of the cornice, hitherto
called X and Y, receive, now that they form the capital, each a separate name; the sloping
stone is called the Bell of the capital, and that laid above it, the Abacus. Abacus means a
board or tile: I wish there were an English word for it, but I fear there is no substitution
possible, the term having been long fixed, and the reader will find it convenient to familiarise
himself with the Latin one.

§ IV. The form of base, e of Fig. XII., which corresponds to this first form of capital, a,
was said to be objectionable only because it looked insecure; and the spurs were added as a
kind of pledge of stability to the eye. But evidently the projecting corners of the abacus
at a, Fig. XIX., are actually insecure; they may break off, if great weight be laid upon them.
This is the chief reason of the ugliness of the form; and the spurs in b are now no mere pledges
of apparent stability, but have very serious practical use in supporting the angle of the abacus.
If, even with the added spur, the support seems insufficient, we may fill up the crannies between
the spurs and the bell, and we have the form c.

Thus a, though the germ and type of capitals, is itself (except under some peculiar conditions)
both ugly and insecure; b is the first type of capitals which carry light weight; c, of capitals
which carry excessive weight.

§ V. I fear, however, the reader may think he is going slightly too fast, and may not like
having the capital forced upon him out of the cornice; but would prefer inventing a capital
for the shaft itself, without reference to the cornice at all. We will do so then; though we
shall come to the same result.

The shaft, it will be remembered, has to sustain the same weight as the long piece of wall
which was concentrated into the shaft; it is enabled to do this both by its better form and
better knit materials; and it can carry a greater weight than the space at the top of it is
adapted to receive. The first point, therefore, is to expand this space as far as possible,
and that in a form more convenient than the circle for the adjustment of the stones above.
In general the square is a more convenient form than any other; but the hexagon or octagon
is sometimes better fitted for masses of work which divide in six or eight directions. Then
our first impulse would be to put a square or hexagonal stone on the top of the shaft, projecting
as far beyond it as might be safely ventured; as at a, Fig. XX. This is the abacus. Our next
idea would be to put a conical shaped stone beneath this abacus, to support its outer edge,
as at b. This is the bell.

§ VI. Now the entire treatment of the capital depends simply on the manner in which this bell-stone
is prepared for fitting the shaft below and the abacus above. Placed as at a, in Fig. XIX.,
it gives us the simplest of possible forms; with the spurs added, as at b, it gives the germ
of the richest and most elaborate forms: but there are two modes of treatment more dexterous
than the one, and less elaborate than the other, which are of the highest possible importance,--modes
in which the bell is brought to its proper form by truncation.

§ VII. Let d and f, Fig. XIX., be two bell-stones; d is part of a cone (a sugar-loaf upside
down, with its point cut off); f part of a four-sided pyramid. Then, assuming the abacus to
be square, d will already fit the shaft, but has to be chiselled to fit the abacus; f will
already fit the abacus, but has to be chiselled to fit the shaft.

From the broad end of d chop or chisel off, in four vertical planes, as much as will leave
its head an exact square. The vertical cuttings will form curves on the sides of the cone (curves
of a curious kind, which the reader need not be troubled to examine), and we shall have the
form at e, which is the root of the greater number of Norman capitals.

From f cut off the angles, beginning at the corners of the square and widening the truncation
downwards, so as to give the form at g, where the base of the bell is an octagon, and its top
remains a square. A very slight rounding away of the angles of the octagon at the base of g
will enable it to fit the circular shaft closely enough for all practical purposes, and this
form, at g, is the root of nearly all Lombardic capitals.

If, instead of a square, the head of the bell were hexagonal or octagonal, the operation of
cutting would be the same on each angle; but there would be produced, of course, six or eight
curves on the sides of e, and twelve or sixteen sides to the base of g.

§ VIII. The truncations in e and g may of course be executed on concave or convex forms of
d and f; but e is usually worked on a straight-sided bell, and the truncation of g often becomes
concave while the bell remains straight; for this simple reason,--that the sharp points at
the angles of g, being somewhat difficult to cut, and easily broken off, are usually avoided
by beginning the truncation a little way down the side of the bell, and then recovering the
lost ground by a deeper cut inwards, as here, Fig. XXI. This is the actual form of the capitals
of the balustrades of St. Mark's: it is the root of all the Byzantine Arab capitals, and of
all the most beautiful capitals in the world, whose function is to express lightness.

§ IX. We have hitherto proceeded entirely on the assumption that the form of cornice which
was gathered together to produce the capital was the root of cornices, a of Fig. V. But this,
it will be remembered, was said in § VI. of Chap. VI. to be especially characteristic of southern
work, and that in northern and wet climates it took the form of a dripstone.

Accordingly, in the northern climates, the dripstone gathered together forms a peculiar northern
capital, commonly called the Early English,[47] owing to its especial use in that style.

There would have been no absurdity in this if shafts were always to be exposed to the weather;
but in Gothic constructions the most important shafts are in the inside of the building. The
dripstone sections of their capitals are therefore unnecessary and ridiculous.

§ X. They are, however, much worse than unnecessary.

The edge of the dripstone, being undercut, has no bearing power, and the capital fails, therefore,
in its own principal function; and besides this, the undercut contour admits of no distinctly
visible decoration; it is, therefore, left utterly barren, and the capital looks as if it had
been turned in a lathe. The Early English capital has, therefore, the three greatest faults
that any design can have: (1) it fails in its own proper purpose, that of support; (2) it is
adapted to a purpose to which it can never be put, that of keeping off rain; (3) it cannot
be decorated.

The Early English capital is, therefore, a barbarism of triple grossness, and degrades the
style in which it is found, otherwise very noble, to one of second-rate order.

§ XI. Dismissing, therefore, the Early English capital, as deserving no place in our system,
let us reassemble in one view the forms which have been legitimately developed, and which are
to become hereafter subjects of decoration. To the forms a, b, and c, Fig. XIX., we must add
the two simplest truncated forms e and g, Fig. XIX., putting their abaci on them (as we considered
their contours in the bells only), and we shall have the five forms now given in parallel perspective
in Fig. XXII., which are the roots of all good capitals existing, or capable of existence,
and whose variations, infinite and a thousand times infinite, are all produced by introduction
of various curvatures into their contours, and the endless methods of decoration superinduced
on such curvatures.

§ XII. There is, however, a kind of variation, also infinite, which takes place in these radical
forms, before they receive either curvature or decoration. This is the variety of proportion
borne by the different lines of the capital to each other, and to the shafts. This is a structural
question, at present to be considered as far as is possible.

§ XIII. All the five capitals (which are indeed five orders with legitimate distinction; very
different, however, from the five orders as commonly understood) may be represented by the
same profile, a section through the sides of a, b, d, and e, or through the angles of c, Fig.
XXII. This profile we will put on the top of a shaft, as at A, Fig. XXIII., which shaft we
will suppose of equal diameter above and below for the sake of greater simplicity: in this
simplest condition, however, relations of proportion exist between five quantities, any one
or any two, or any three, or any four of which may change, irrespective of the others. These
five quantities are:

  1. The height of the shaft, a b;
  2. Its diameter, b c;
  3. The length of slope of bell, b d;
  4. The inclination of this slope, or angle c b d;
  5. The depth of abacus, d e.

For every change in any one of these quantities we have a new proportion of capital: five infinities,
supposing change only in one quantity at a time: infinity of infinities in the sum of possible
changes.

It is, therefore, only possible to note the general laws of change; every scale of pillar,
and every weight laid upon it admitting, within certain limits, a variety out of which the
architect has his choice; but yet fixing limits which the proportion becomes ugly when it approaches,
and dangerous when it exceeds. But the inquiry into this subject is too difficult for the general
reader, and I shall content myself with proving four laws, easily understood and generally
applicable; for proof of which if the said reader care not, he may miss the next four paragraphs
without harm.

§ XIV. 1. The more slender the shaft, the greater, proportionally, may be the projection of
the abacus. For, looking back to Fig. XXIII., let the height a b be fixed, the length d b,
the angle d b c, and the depth d e. Let the single quantity b c be variable, let B be a capital
and shaft which are found to be perfectly safe in proportion to the weight they bear, and let
the weight be equally distributed over the whole of the abacus. Then this weight may be represented
by any number of equal divisions, suppose four, as l, m, n, r, of brickwork above, of which
each division is one fourth of the whole weight; and let this weight be placed in the most
trying way on the abacus, that is to say, let the masses l and r be detached from m and n,
and bear with their full weight on the outside of the capital. We assume, in B, that the width
of abacus e f is twice as great as that of the shaft, b c, and on these conditions we assume
the capital to be safe.

But b c is allowed to be variable. Let it become b2 c2 at C, which is a length representing
about the diameter of a shaft containing half the substance of the shaft B, and, therefore,
able to sustain not more than half the weight sustained by B. But the slope b d and depth d
e remaining unchanged, we have the capital of C, which we are to load with only half the weight
of l, m, n, r, i.e., with l and r alone. Therefore the weight of l and r, now represented by
the masses l2, r2, is distributed over the whole of the capital. But the weight r was adequately
supported by the projecting piece of the first capital h f c: much more is it now adequately
supported by i h, f2 c2. Therefore, if the capital of B was safe, that of C is more than safe.
Now in B the length e f was only twice b c; but in C, e2 f2 will be found more than twice that
of b2 c2. Therefore, the more slender the shaft, the greater may be the proportional excess
of the abacus over its diameter.

§ XV. 2. The smaller the scale of the building, the greater may be the excess of the abacus
over the diameter of the shaft. This principle requires, I think, no very lengthy proof: the
reader can understand at once that the cohesion and strength of stone which can sustain a small
projecting mass, will not sustain a vast one overhanging in the same proportion. A bank even
of loose earth, six feet high, will sometimes overhang its base a foot or two, as you may see
any day in the gravelly banks of the lanes of Hampstead: but make the bank of gravel, equally
loose, six hundred feet high, and see if you can get it to overhang a hundred or two! much
more if there be weight above it increased in the same proportion. Hence, let any capital be
given, whose projection is just safe, and no more, on its existing scale; increase its proportions
every way equally, though ever so little, and it is unsafe; diminish them equally, and it becomes
safe in the exact degree of the diminution.

Let, then, the quantity e d, and angle d b c, at A of Fig. XXIII., be invariable, and let the
length d b vary: then we shall have such a series of forms as may be represented by a, b, c,
Fig. XXIV., of which a is a proportion for a colossal building, b for a moderately sized building,
while c could only be admitted on a very small scale indeed.

§ XVI. 3. The greater the excess of abacus, the steeper must be the slope of the bell, the
shaft diameter being constant.

This will evidently follow from the considerations in the last paragraph; supposing only that,
instead of the scale of shaft and capital varying together, the scale of the capital varies
alone. For it will then still be true, that, if the projection of the capital be just safe
on a given scale, as its excess over the shaft diameter increases, the projection will be unsafe,
if the slope of the bell remain constant. But it may be rendered safe by making this slope
steeper, and so increasing its supporting power.

Thus let the capital a, Fig. XXV., be just safe. Then the capital b, in which the slope is
the same but the excess greater, is unsafe. But the capital c, in which, though the excess
equals that of b, the steepness of the supporting slope is increased, will be as safe as b,
and probably as strong as a.[48]

§ XVII. 4. The steeper the slope of the bell, the thinner may be the abacus.

The use of the abacus is eminently to equalise the pressure over the surface of the bell, so
that the weight may not by any accident be directed exclusively upon its edges. In proportion
to the strength of these edges, this function of the abacus is superseded, and these edges
are strong in proportion to the steepness of the slope. Thus in Fig. XXVI., the bell at a would
carry weight safely enough without any abacus, but that at c would not: it would probably have
its edges broken off. The abacus superimposed might be on a very thin, little more than formal,
as at b; but on c must be thick, as at d.

§ XVIII. These four rules are all that are necessary for general criticism; and observe that
these are only semi-imperative,--rules of permission, not of compulsion. Thus Law 1 asserts
that the slender shaft may have greater excess of capital than the thick shaft; but it need
not, unless the architect chooses; his thick shafts must have small excess, but his slender
ones need not have large. So Law 2 says, that as the building is smaller, the excess may be
greater; but it need not, for the excess which is safe in the large is still safer in the small.
So Law 3 says that capitals of great excess must have steep slopes; but it does not say that
capitals of small excess may not have steep slopes also, if we choose. And lastly, Law 4 asserts
the necessity of the thick abacus for the shallow bell; but the steep bell may have a thick
abacus also.

§ XIX. It will be found, however, that in practice some confession of these laws will always
be useful, and especially of the two first. The eye always requires, on a slender shaft, a
more spreading capital than it does on a massy one, and a bolder mass of capital on a small
scale than on a large. And, in the application of the first rule, it is to be noted that a
shaft becomes slender either by diminution of diameter or increase of height; that either mode
of change presupposes the weight above it diminished, and requires an expansion of abacus.
I know no mode of spoiling a noble building more frequent in actual practice than the imposition
of flat and slightly expanded capitals on tall shafts.

§ XX. The reader must observe, also, that, in the demonstration of the four laws, I always
assumed the weight above to be given. By the alteration of this weight, therefore, the architect
has it in his power to relieve, and therefore alter, the forms of his capitals. By its various
distribution on their centres or edges, the slope of their bells and thickness of abaci will
be affected also; so that he has countless expedients at his command for the various treatment
of his design. He can divide his weights among more shafts; he can throw them in different
places and different directions on the abaci; he can alter slope of bells or diameter of shafts;
he can use spurred or plain bells, thin or thick abaci; and all these changes admitting of
infinity in their degrees, and infinity a thousand times told in their relations: and all this
without reference to decoration, merely with the five forms of block capital!

§ XXI. In the harmony of these arrangements, in their fitness, unity, and accuracy, lies the
true proportion of every building,--proportion utterly endless in its infinities of change,
with unchanged beauty. And yet this connexion of the frame of their building into one harmony
has, I believe, never been so much as dreamed of by architects. It has been instinctively done
in some degree by many, empirically in some degree by many more; thoughtfully and thoroughly,
I believe, by none.

§ XXII. We have hitherto considered the abacus as necessarily a separate stone from the bell:
evidently, however, the strength of the capital will be undiminished if both are cut out of
one block. This is actually the case in many capitals, especially those on a small scale; and
in others the detached upper stone is a mere representative of the abacus, and is much thinner
than the form of the capital requires, while the true abacus is united with the bell, and concealed
by its decoration, or made part of it.

§ XXIII. Farther. We have hitherto considered bell and abacus as both derived from the concentration
of the cornice. But it must at once occur to the reader, that the projection of the under stone
and the thickness of the upper, which are quite enough for the work of the continuous cornice,
may not be enough always, or rather are seldom likely to be so, for the harder work of the
capital. Both may have to be deepened and expanded: but as this would cause a want of harmony
in the parts, when they occur on the same level, it is better in such case to let the entire
cornice form the abacus of the capital, and put a deep capital bell beneath it.

§ XXIV. The reader will understand both arrangements instantly by two examples. Fig. XXVII.
represents two windows, more than usually beautiful examples of a very frequent Venetian form.
Here the deep cornice or string course which runs along the wall of the house is quite strong
enough for the work of the capitals of the slender shafts: its own upper stone is therefore
also theirs; its own lower stone, by its revolution or concentration, forms their bells: but
to mark the increased importance of its function in so doing, it receives decoration, as the
bell of the capital, which it did not receive as the under stone of the cornice.

In Fig. XXVIII., a little bit of the church of Santa Fosca at Torcello, the cornice or string
course, which goes round every part of the church, is not strong enough to form the capitals
of the shafts. It therefore forms their abaci only; and in order to mark the diminished importance
of its function, it ceases to receive, as the abacus of the capital, the decoration which it
received as the string course of the wall.

This last arrangement is of great frequency in Venice, occurring most characteristically in
St. Mark's: and in the Gothic of St. John and Paul we find the two arrangements beautifully
united, though in great simplicity; the string courses of the walls form the capitals of the
shafts of the traceries; and the abaci of the vaulting shafts of the apse.

§ XXV. We have hitherto spoken of capitals of circular shafts only: those of square piers are
more frequently formed by the cornice only; otherwise they are like those of circular piers,
without the difficulty of reconciling the base of the bell with its head.

§ XXVI. When two or more shafts are grouped together, their capitals are usually treated as
separate, until they come into actual contact. If there be any awkwardness in the junction,
it is concealed by the decoration, and one abacus serves, in most cases, for all. The double
group, Fig. XXVII., is the simplest possible type of the arrangement. In the richer Northern
Gothic groups of eighteen or twenty shafts cluster together, and sometimes the smaller shafts
crouch under the capitals of the larger, and hide their heads in the crannies, with small nominal
abaci of their own, while the larger shafts carry the serviceable abacus of the whole pier,
as in the nave of Rouen. There is, however, evident sacrifice of sound principle in this system,
the smaller abaci being of no use. They are the exact contrary of the rude early abacus at
Milan, given in Plate XVII. There one poor abacus stretched itself out to do all the work:
here there are idle abaci getting up into corners and doing none.

§ XXVII. Finally, we have considered the capital hitherto entirely as an expansion of the bearing
power of the shaft, supposing the shaft composed of a single stone. But, evidently, the capital
has a function, if possible, yet more important, when the shaft is composed of small masonry.
It enables all that masonry to act together, and to receive the pressure from above collectively
and with a single strength. And thus, considered merely as a large stone set on the top of
the shaft, it is a feature of the highest architectural importance, irrespective of its expansion,
which indeed is, in some very noble capitals, exceedingly small. And thus every large stone
set at any important point to reassemble the force of smaller masonry and prepare it for the
sustaining of weight, is a capital or "head" stone (the true meaning of the word) whether it
project or not. Thus at 6, in Plate IV., the stones which support the thrust of the brickwork
are capitals, which have no projection at all; and the large stones in the window above are
capitals projecting in one direction only.

§ XXVIII. The reader is now master of all he need know respecting construction of capitals;
and from what has been laid before him, must assuredly feel that there can never be any new
system of architectural forms invented; but that all vertical support must be, to the end of
time, best obtained by shafts and capitals. It has been so obtained by nearly every nation
of builders, with more or less refinement in the management of the details; and the later Gothic
builders of the North stand almost alone in their effort to dispense with the natural development
of the shaft, and banish the capital from their compositions.

They were gradually led into this error through a series of steps which it is not here our
business to trace. But they may be generalised in a few words.

§ XXIX. All classical architecture, and the Romanesque which is legitimately descended from
it, is composed of bold independent shafts, plain or fluted, with bold detached capitals, forming
arcades or colonnades where they are needed; and of walls whose apertures are surrounded by
courses of parallel lines called mouldings, which are continuous round the apertures, and have
neither shafts nor capitals. The shaft system and moulding system are entirely separate.

The Gothic architects confounded the two. They clustered the shafts till they looked like a
group of mouldings. They shod and capitaled the mouldings till they looked like a group of
shafts. So that a pier became merely the side of a door or window rolled up, and the side of
the window a pier unrolled (vide last Chapter, § XXX.), both being composed of a series of
small shafts, each with base and capital. The architect seemed to have whole mats of shafts
at his disposal, like the rush mats which one puts under cream cheese. If he wanted a great
pier he rolled up the mat; if he wanted the side of a door he spread out the mat: and now the
reader has to add to the other distinctions between the Egyptian and the Gothic shaft, already
noted in § XXVI. of Chap. VIII., this one more--the most important of all--that while the Egyptian
rush cluster has only one massive capital altogether, the Gothic rush mat has a separate tiny
capital to every several rush.

§ XXX. The mats were gradually made of finer rushes, until it became troublesome to give each
rush its capital. In fact, when the groups of shafts became excessively complicated, the expansion
of their small abaci was of no use: it was dispensed with altogether, and the mouldings of
pier and jamb ran up continuously into the arches.

This condition, though in many respects faulty and false, is yet the eminently characteristic
state of Gothic: it is the definite formation of it as a distinct style, owing no farther aid
to classical models; and its lightness and complexity render it, when well treated, and enriched
with Flamboyant decoration, a very glorious means of picturesque effect. It is, in fact, this
form of Gothic which commends itself most easily to the general mind, and which has suggested
the innumerable foolish theories about the derivation of Gothic from tree trunks and avenues,
which have from time to time been brought forward by persons ignorant of the history of architecture.

§ XXXI. When the sense of picturesqueness, as well as that of justness and dignity, had been
lost, the spring of the continuous mouldings was replaced by what Professor Willis calls the
Discontinuous impost; which, being a barbarism of the basest and most painful kind, and being
to architecture what the setting of a saw is to music, I shall not trouble the reader to examine.
For it is not in my plan to note for him all the various conditions of error, but only to guide
him to the appreciation of the right; and I only note even the true Continuous or Flamboyant
Gothic because this is redeemed by its beautiful decoration, afterwards to be considered. For,
as far as structure is concerned, the moment the capital vanishes from the shaft, that moment
we are in error: all good Gothic has true capitals to the shafts of its jambs and traceries,
and all Gothic is debased the instant the shaft vanishes. It matters not how slender, or how
small, or how low, the shaft may be: wherever there is indication of concentrated vertical
support, then the capital is a necessary termination. I know how much Gothic, otherwise beautiful,
this sweeping principle condemns; but it condemns not altogether. We may still take delight
in its lovely proportions, its rich decoration, or its elastic and reedy moulding; but be assured,
wherever shafts, or any approximations to the forms of shafts, are employed, for whatever office,
or on whatever scale, be it in jambs or piers, or balustrades, or traceries, without capitals,
there is a defiance of the natural laws of construction; and that, wherever such examples are
found in ancient buildings, they are either the experiments of barbarism, or the commencements
of decline.

FOOTNOTES:

  [47] Appendix 19, "Early English Capitals."

  [48] In this case the weight borne is supposed to increase as the
    abacus widens; the illustration would have been clearer if I had
    assumed the breadth of abacus to be constant, and that of the shaft
    to vary.

CHAPTER X.

  THE ARCH LINE.

§ I. We have seen in the last section how our means of vertical support may, for the sake of
economy both of space and material, be gathered into piers or shafts, and directed to the sustaining
of particular points. The next question is how to connect these points or tops of shafts with
each other, so as to be able to lay on them a continuous roof. This the reader, as before,
is to favor me by finding out for himself, under these following conditions.

Let s, s, Fig. XXIX. opposite, be two shafts, with their capitals ready prepared for their
work; and a, b, b, and c, c, c, be six stones of different sizes, one very long and large,
and two smaller, and three smaller still, of which the reader is to choose which he likes best,
in order to connect the tops of the shafts.

I suppose he will first try if he can lift the great stone a, and if he can, he will put it
very simply on the tops of the two pillars, as at A.

Very well indeed: he has done already what a number of Greek architects have been thought very
clever for having done. But suppose he cannot lift the great stone a, or suppose I will not
give it to him, but only the two smaller stones at b, b; he will doubtless try to put them
up, tilted against each other, as at d. Very awkward this; worse than card-house building.
But if he cuts off the corners of the stones, so as to make each of them of the form e, they
will stand up very securely, as at B.

But suppose he cannot lift even these less stones, but can raise those at c, c, c. Then, cutting
each of them into the form at e, he will doubtless set them up as at f.

§ II. This last arrangement looks a little dangerous. Is there not a chance of the stone in
the middle pushing the others out, or tilting them up and aside, and slipping down itself between
them? There is such a chance: and if by somewhat altering the form of the stones, we can diminish
this chance, all the better. I must say "we" now, for perhaps I may have to help the reader
a little.

The danger is, observe, that the midmost stone at f pushes out the side ones: then if we can
give the side ones such a shape as that, left to themselves, they would fall heavily forward,
they will resist this push out by their weight, exactly in proportion to their own particular
inclination or desire to tumble in. Take one of them separately, standing up as at g; it is
just possible it may stand up as it is, like the Tower of Pisa: but we want it to fall forward.
Suppose we cut away the parts that are shaded at h and leave it as at i, it is very certain
it cannot stand alone now, but will fall forward to our entire satisfaction.

Farther: the midmost stone at f is likely to be troublesome chiefly by its weight, pushing
down between the others; the more we lighten it the better: so we will cut it into exactly
the same shape as the side ones, chiselling away the shaded parts, as at h. We shall then have
all the three stones k, l, m, of the same shape; and now putting them together, we have, at
C, what the reader, I doubt not, will perceive at once to be a much more satisfactory arrangement
than that at f.

§ III. We have now got three arrangements; in one using only one piece of stone, in the second
two, and in the third three. The first arrangement has no particular name, except the "horizontal:"
but the single stone (or beam, it may be,) is called a lintel; the second arrangement is called
a "Gable;" the third an "Arch."

We might have used pieces of wood instead of stone in all these arrangements, with no difference
in plan, so long as the beams were kept loose, like the stones; but as beams can be securely
nailed together at the ends, we need not trouble ourselves so much about their shape or balance,
and therefore the plan at f is a peculiarly wooden construction (the reader will doubtless
recognise in it the profile of many a farm-house roof): and again, because beams are tough,
and light, and long, as compared with stones, they are admirably adapted for the constructions
at A and B, the plain lintel and gable, while that at C is, for the most part, left to brick
and stone.

§ IV. But farther. The constructions, A, B, and C, though very conveniently to be first considered
as composed of one, two, and three pieces, are by no means necessarily so. When we have once
cut the stones of the arch into a shape like that of k, l, and m, they will hold together,
whatever their number, place, or size, as at n; and the great value of the arch is, that it
permits small stones to be used with safety instead of large ones, which are not always to
be had. Stones cut into the shape of k, l, and m, whether they be short or long (I have drawn
them all sizes at n on purpose), are called Voussoirs; this is a hard, ugly French name; but
the reader will perhaps be kind enough to recollect it; it will save us both some trouble:
and to make amends for this infliction, I will relieve him of the term keystone. One voussoir
is as much a keystone as another; only people usually call the stone which is last put in the
keystone; and that one happens generally to be at the top or middle of the arch.

§ V. Not only the arch, but even the lintel, may be built of many stones or bricks. The reader
may see lintels built in this way over most of the windows of our brick London houses, and
so also the gable: there are, therefore, two distinct questions respecting each arrangement;--First,
what is the line or direction of it, which gives it its strength? and, secondly, what is the
manner of masonry of it, which gives it its consistence? The first of these I shall consider
in this Chapter under the head of the Arch Line, using the term arch as including all manner
of construction (though we shall have no trouble except about curves); and in the next Chapter
I shall consider the second, under the head, Arch Masonry.

§ VI. Now the arch line is the ghost or skeleton of the arch; or rather it is the spinal marrow
of the arch, and the voussoirs are the vertebræ, which keep it safe and sound, and clothe it.
This arch line the architect has first to conceive and shape in his mind, as opposed to, or
having to bear, certain forces which will try to distort it this way and that; and against
which he is first to direct and bend the line itself into as strong resistance as he may, and
then, with his voussoirs and what else he can, to guard it, and help it, and keep it to its
duty and in its shape. So the arch line is the moral character of the arch, and the adverse
forces are its temptations; and the voussoirs, and what else we may help it with, are its armor
and its motives to good conduct.

§ VII. This moral character of the arch is called by architects its "Line of Resistance." There
is a great deal of nicety in calculating it with precision, just as there is sometimes in finding
out very precisely what is a man's true line of moral conduct; but this, in arch morality and
in man morality, is a very simple and easily to be understood principle,--that if either arch
or man expose themselves to their special temptations or adverse forces, outside of the voussoirs
or proper and appointed armor, both will fall. An arch whose line of resistance is in the middle
of its voussoirs is perfectly safe: in proportion as the said line runs near the edge of its
voussoirs, the arch is in danger, as the man is who nears temptation; and the moment the line
of resistance emerges out of the voussoirs the arch falls.

§ VIII. There are, therefore, properly speaking, two arch lines. One is the visible direction
or curve of the arch, which may generally be considered as the under edge of its voussoirs,
and which has often no more to do with the real stability of the arch, than a man's apparent
conduct has with his heart. The other line, which is the line of resistance, or line of good
behavior, may or may not be consistent with the outward and apparent curves of the arch; but
if not, then the security of the arch depends simply upon this, whether the voussoirs which
assume or pretend to the one line are wide enough to include the other.

§ IX. Now when the reader is told that the line of resistance varies with every change either
in place or quantity of the weight above the arch, he will see at once that we have no chance
of arranging arches by their moral characters: we can only take the apparent arch line, or
visible direction, as a ground of arrangement. We shall consider the possible or probable forms
or contours of arches in the present Chapter, and in the succeeding one the forms of voussoir
and other help which may best fortify these visible lines against every temptation to lose
their consistency.

§ X. Look back to Fig. XXIX. Evidently the abstract or ghost line of the arrangement at A is
a plain horizontal line, as here at a, Fig. XXX. The abstract line of the arrangement at B,
Fig. XXIX., is composed of two straight lines, set against each other, as here at b. The abstract
line of C, Fig. XXIX., is a curve of some kind, not at present determined, suppose c, Fig.
XXX. Then, as b is two of the straight lines at a, set up against each other, we may conceive
an arrangement, d, made up of two of the curved lines at c, set against each other. This is
called a pointed arch, which is a contradiction in terms: it ought to be called a curved gable;
but it must keep the name it has got.

Now a, b, c, d, Fig. XXX., are the ghosts of the lintel, the gable, the arch, and the pointed
arch. With the poor lintel ghost we need trouble ourselves no farther; there are no changes
in him: but there is much variety in the other three, and the method of their variety will
be best discerned by studying b and d, as subordinate to and connected with the simple arch at c.

§ XI. Many architects, especially the worst, have been very curious in designing out of the
way arches,--elliptical arches, and four-centred arches, so called, and other singularities.
The good architects have generally been content, and we for the present will be so, with God's
arch, the arch of the rainbow and of the apparent heaven, and which the sun shapes for us as
it sets and rises. Let us watch the sun for a moment as it climbs: when it is a quarter up,
it will give us the arch a, Fig. XXXI.; when it is half up, b, and when three quarters up,
c. There will be an infinite number of arches between these, but we will take these as sufficient
representatives of all. Then a is the low arch, b the central or pure arch, c the high arch,
and the rays of the sun would have drawn for us their voussoirs.

§ XII. We will take these several arches successively, and fixing the top of each accurately,
draw two right lines thence to its base, d, e, f, Fig. XXXI. Then these lines give us the relative
gables of each of the arches; d is the Italian or southern gable, e the central gable, f the
Gothic gable.

§ XIII. We will again take the three arches with their gables in succession, and on each of
the sides of the gable, between it and the arch, we will describe another arch, as at g, h,
i. Then the curves so described give the pointed arches belonging to each of the round arches;
g, the flat pointed arch, h, the central pointed arch, and i, the lancet pointed arch.

§ XIV. If the radius with which these intermediate curves are drawn be the base of f, the last
is the equilateral pointed arch, one of great importance in Gothic work. But between the gable
and circle, in all the three figures, there are an infinite number of pointed arches, describable
with different radii; and the three round arches, be it remembered, are themselves representatives
of an infinite number, passing from the flattest conceivable curve, through the semicircle
and horseshoe, up to the full circle.

The central and the last group are the most important. The central round, or semicircle, is
the Roman, the Byzantine, and Norman arch; and its relative pointed includes one wide branch
of Gothic. The horseshoe round is the Arabic and Moorish arch, and its relative pointed includes
the whole range of Arabic and lancet, or Early English and French Gothics. I mean of course
by the relative pointed, the entire group of which the equilateral arch is the representative.
Between it and the outer horseshoe, as this latter rises higher, the reader will find, on experiment,
the great families of what may be called the horseshoe pointed,--curves of the highest importance,
but which are all included, with English lancet, under the term, relative pointed of the horseshoe
arch.

§ XV. The groups above described are all formed of circular arcs, and include all truly useful
and beautiful arches for ordinary work. I believe that singular and complicated curves are
made use of in modern engineering, but with these the general reader can have no concern: the
Ponte della Trinita at Florence is the most graceful instance I know of such structure; the
arch made use of being very subtle, and approximating to the low ellipse; for which, in common
work, a barbarous pointed arch, called four-centred, and composed of bits of circles, is substituted
by the English builders. The high ellipse, I believe, exists in eastern architecture. I have
never myself met with it on a large scale; but it occurs in the niches of the later portions
of the Ducal palace at Venice, together with a singular hyperbolic arch, a in Fig. XXXIII.,
to be described hereafter: with such caprices we are not here concerned.

§ XVI. We are, however, concerned to notice the absurdity of another form of arch, which, with
the four-centred, belongs to the English perpendicular Gothic.

Taking the gable of any of the groups in Fig. XXXI. (suppose the equilateral), here at b, in
Fig. XXXIII., the dotted line representing the relative pointed arch, we may evidently conceive
an arch formed by reversed curves on the inside of the gable, as here shown by the inner curved
lines. I imagine the reader by this time knows enough of the nature of arches to understand
that, whatever strength or stability was gained by the curve on the outside of the gable, exactly
so much is lost by curves on the inside. The natural tendency of such an arch to dissolution
by its own mere weight renders it a feature of detestable ugliness, wherever it occurs on a
large scale. It is eminently characteristic of Tudor work, and it is the profile of the Chinese
roof (I say on a large scale, because this as well as all other capricious arches, may be made
secure by their masonry when small, but not otherwise). Some allowable modifications of it
will be noticed in the chapter on Roofs.

§ XVII. There is only one more form of arch which we have to notice. When the last described
arch is used, not as the principal arrangement, but as a mere heading to a common pointed arch,
we have the form c, Fig. XXXIII. Now this is better than the entirely reversed arch for two
reasons; first, less of the line is weakened by reversing; secondly, the double curve has a
very high æsthetic value, not existing in the mere segments of circles. For these reasons arches
of this kind are not only admissible, but even of great desirableness, when their scale and
masonry render them secure, but above a certain scale they are altogether barbarous; and, with
the reversed Tudor arch, wantonly employed, are the characteristics of the worst and meanest
schools of architecture, past or present.

This double curve is called the Ogee; it is the profile of many German leaden roofs, of many
Turkish domes (there more excusable, because associated and in sympathy with exquisitely managed
arches of the same line in the walls below), of Tudor turrets, as in Henry the Seventh's Chapel,
and it is at the bottom or top of sundry other blunders all over the world.

§ XVIII. The varieties of the ogee curve are infinite, as the reversed portion of it may be
engrafted on every other form of arch, horseshoe, round, or pointed. Whatever is generally
worthy of note in these varieties, and in other arches of caprice, we shall best discover by
examining their masonry; for it is by their good masonry only that they are rendered either
stable or beautiful. To this question, then, let us address ourselves.

CHAPTER XI.

  THE ARCH MASONRY.

§ I. On the subject of the stability of arches, volumes have been written and volumes more
are required. The reader will not, therefore, expect from me any very complete explanation
of its conditions within the limits of a single chapter. But that which is necessary for him
to know is very simple and very easy; and yet, I believe, some part of it is very little known,
or noticed.

We must first have a clear idea of what is meant by an arch. It is a curved shell of firm materials,
on whose back a burden is to be laid of loose materials. So far as the materials above it are
not loose, but themselves hold together, the opening below is not an arch, but an excavation.
Note this difference very carefully. If the King of Sardinia tunnels through the Mont Cenis,
as he proposes, he will not require to build a brick arch under his tunnel to carry the weight
of the Mont Cenis: that would need scientific masonry indeed. The Mont Cenis will carry itself,
by its own cohesion, and a succession of invisible granite arches, rather larger than the tunnel.
But when Mr. Brunel tunnelled the Thames bottom, he needed to build a brick arch to carry the
six or seven feet of mud and the weight of water above. That is a type of all arches proper.

§ II. Now arches, in practice, partake of the nature of the two. So far as their masonry above
is Mont-Cenisian, that is to say, colossal in comparison of them, and granitic, so that the
arch is a mere hole in the rock substance of it, the form of the arch is of no consequence
whatever: it may be rounded, or lozenged, or ogee'd, or anything else; and in the noblest architecture
there is always some character of this kind given to the masonry. It is independent enough
not to care about the holes cut in it, and does not subside into them like sand. But the theory
of arches does not presume on any such condition of things; it allows itself only the shell
of the arch proper; the vertebræ, carrying their marrow of resistance; and, above this shell,
it assumes the wall to be in a state of flux, bearing down on the arch, like water or sand,
with its whole weight. And farther, the problem which is to be solved by the arch builder is
not merely to carry this weight, but to carry it with the least thickness of shell. It is easy
to carry it by continually thickening your voussoirs: if you have six feet depth of sand or
gravel to carry, and you choose to employ granite voussoirs six feet thick, no question but
your arch is safe enough. But it is perhaps somewhat too costly: the thing to be done is to
carry the sand or gravel with brick voussoirs, six inches thick, or, at any rate, with the
least thickness of voussoir which will be safe; and to do this requires peculiar arrangement
of the lines of the arch. There are many arrangements, useful all in their way, but we have
only to do, in the best architecture, with the simplest and most easily understood. We have
first to note those which regard the actual shell of the arch, and then we shall give a few
examples of the superseding of such expedients by Mont-Cenisian masonry.

§ III. What we have to say will apply to all arches, but the central pointed arch is the best
for general illustration. Let a, Plate III., be the shell of a pointed arch with loose loading
above; and suppose you find that shell not quite thick enough; and that the weight bears too
heavily on the top of the arch, and is likely to break it in: you proceed to thicken your shell,
but need you thicken it all equally? Not so; you would only waste your good voussoirs. If you
have any common sense you will thicken it at the top, where a Mylodon's skull is thickened
for the same purpose (and some human skulls, I fancy), as at b. The pebbles and gravel above
will now shoot off it right and left, as the bullets do off a cuirassier's breastplate, and
will have no chance of beating it in.

If still it be not strong enough, a farther addition may be made, as at c, now thickening the
voussoirs a little at the base also. But as this may perhaps throw the arch inconveniently
high, or occasion a waste of voussoirs at the top, we may employ another expedient.

§ IV. I imagine the reader's common sense, if not his previous knowledge, will enable him to
understand that if the arch at a, Plate III., burst in at the top, it must burst out at the
sides. Set up two pieces of pasteboard, edge to edge, and press them down with your hand, and
you will see them bend out at the sides. Therefore, if you can keep the arch from starting
out at the points p, p, it cannot curve in at the top, put what weight on it you will, unless
by sheer crushing of the stones to fragments.

§ V. Now you may keep the arch from starting out at p by loading it at p, putting more weight
upon it and against it at that point; and this, in practice, is the way it is usually done.
But we assume at present that the weight above is sand or water, quite unmanageable, not to
be directed to the points we choose; and in practice, it may sometimes happen that we cannot
put weight upon the arch at p. We may perhaps want an opening above it, or it may be at the
side of the building, and many other circumstances may occur to hinder us.

§ VI. But if we are not sure that we can put weight above it, we are perfectly sure that we
can hang weight under it. You may always thicken your shell inside, and put the weight upon
it as at x x, in d, Plate III. Not much chance of its bursting out at p, now, is there?

§ VII. Whenever, therefore, an arch has to bear vertical pressure, it will bear it better when
its shell is shaped as at b or d, than as at a: b and d are, therefore, the types of arches
built to resist vertical pressure, all over the world, and from the beginning of architecture
to its end. None others can be compared with them: all are imperfect except these.

The added projections at x x, in d, are called CUSPS, and they are the very soul and life of
the best northern Gothic; yet never thoroughly understood nor found in perfection, except in
Italy, the northern builders working often, even in the best times, with the vulgar form at a.

The form at b is rarely found in the north: its perfection is in the Lombardic Gothic; and
branches of it, good and bad according to their use, occur in Saracenic work.

§ VIII. The true and perfect cusp is single only. But it was probably invented (by the Arabs?)
not as a constructive, but a decorative feature, in pure fantasy; and in early northern work
it is only the application to the arch of the foliation, so called, of penetrated spaces in
stone surfaces, already enough explained in the "Seven Lamps," Chap. III., p. 85 et seq. It
is degraded in dignity, and loses its usefulness, exactly in proportion to its multiplication
on the arch. In later architecture, especially English Tudor, it is sunk into dotage, and becomes
a simple excrescence, a bit of stone pinched up out of the arch, as a cook pinches the paste
at the edge of a pie.

§ IX. The depth and place of the cusp, that is to say, its exact application to the shoulder
of the curve of the arch, varies with the direction of the weight to be sustained. I have spent
more than a month, and that in hard work too, in merely trying to get the forms of cusps into
perfect order: whereby the reader may guess that I have not space to go into the subject now;
but I shall hereafter give a few of the leading and most perfect examples, with their measures
and masonry.

§ X. The reader now understands all that he need about the shell of the arch, considered as
an united piece of stone.

He has next to consider the shape of the voussoirs. This, as much as is required, he will be
able best to comprehend by a few examples; by which I shall be able also to illustrate, or
rather which will force me to illustrate, some of the methods of Mont-Cenisian masonry, which
were to be the second part of our subject.

§ XI. 1 and 2, Plate IV., are two cornices; 1 from St. Antonio, Padua; 2, from the Cathedral
of Sens. I want them for cornices; but I have put them in this plate because, though their
arches are filled up behind, and are in fact mere blocks of stone with arches cut into their
faces, they illustrate the constant masonry of small arches, both in Italian and Northern Romanesque,
but especially Italian, each arch being cut out of its own proper block of stone: this is Mont-Cenisian
enough, on a small scale.

3 is a window from Carnarvon Castle, and very primitive and interesting in manner,--one of
its arches being of one stone, the other of two. And here we have an instance of a form of
arch which would be barbarous enough on a large scale, and of many pieces; but quaint and agreeable
thus massively built.

4 is from a little belfry in a Swiss village above Vevay; one fancies the window of an absurd
form, seen in the distance, but one is pleased with it on seeing its masonry. It could hardly
be stronger.

§ XII. These then are arches cut of one block. The next step is to form them of two pieces,
set together at the head of the arch. 6, from the Eremitani, Padua, is very quaint and primitive
in manner: it is a curious church altogether, and has some strange traceries cut out of single
blocks. One is given in the "Seven Lamps," Plate VII., in the left-hand corner at the bottom.

7, from the Frari, Venice, very firm and fine, and admirably decorated, as we shall see hereafter.
5, the simple two-pieced construction, wrought with the most exquisite proportion and precision
of workmanship, as is everything else in the glorious church to which it belongs, San Fermo
of Verona. The addition of the top piece, which completes the circle, does not affect the plan
of the beautiful arches, with their simple and perfect cusps; but it is highly curious, and
serves to show how the idea of the cusp rose out of mere foliation. The whole of the architecture
of this church may be characterised as exhibiting the maxima of simplicity in construction,
and perfection in workmanship,--a rare unison: for, in general, simple designs are rudely worked,
and as the builder perfects his execution, he complicates his plan. Nearly all the arches of
San Fermo are two-pieced.

§ XIII. We have seen the construction with one and two pieces: a and b, Fig. 8, Plate IV.,
are the general types of the construction with three pieces, uncusped and cusped; c and d with
five pieces, uncusped and cusped. Of these the three-pieced construction is of enormous importance,
and must detain us some time. The five-pieced is the three-pieced with a joint added on each
side, and is also of great importance. The four-pieced, which is the two-pieced with added
joints, rarely occurs, and need not detain us.

§ XIV. It will be remembered that in first working out the principle of the arch, we composed
the arch of three pieces. Three is the smallest number which can exhibit the real principle
of arch masonry, and it may be considered as representative of all arches built on that principle;
the one and two-pieced arches being microscopic Mont-Cenisian, mere caves in blocks of stone,
or gaps between two rocks leaning together.

But the three-pieced arch is properly representative of all; and the larger and more complicated
constructions are merely produced by keeping the central piece for what is called a keystone,
and putting additional joints at the sides. Now so long as an arch is pure circular or pointed,
it does not matter how many joints or voussoirs you have, nor where the joints are; nay, you
may joint your keystone itself, and make it two-pieced. But if the arch be of any bizarre form,
especially ogee, the joints must be in particular places, and the masonry simple, or it will
not be thoroughly good and secure; and the fine schools of the ogee arch have only arisen in
countries where it was the custom to build arches of few pieces.

§ XV. The typical pure pointed arch of Venice is a five-pieced arch, with its stones in three
orders of magnitude, the longest being the lowest, as at b2, Plate III. If the arch be very
large, a fourth order of magnitude is added, as at a2. The portals of the palaces of Venice
have one or other of these masonries, almost without exception. Now, as one piece is added
to make a larger door, one piece is taken away to make a smaller one, or a window, and the
masonry type of the Venetian Gothic window is consequently three-pieced, c2.

§ XVI. The reader knows already where a cusp is useful. It is wanted, he will remember, to
give weight to those side stones, and draw them inwards against the thrust of the top stone.
Take one of the side stones of c2 out for a moment, as at d. Now the proper place of the cusp
upon it varies with the weight which it bears or requires; but in practice this nicety is rarely
observed; the place of the cusp is almost always determined by æsthetic considerations, and
it is evident that the variations in its place may be infinite. Consider the cusp as a wave
passing up the side stone from its bottom to its top; then you will have the succession of
forms from e to g (Plate III.), with infinite degrees of transition from each to each; but
of which you may take e, f, and g, as representing three great families of cusped arches. Use
e for your side stones, and you have an arch as that at h below, which may be called a down-cusped
arch. Use f for the side stone, and you have i, which may be called a mid-cusped arch. Use
g, and you have k, an up-cusped arch.

§ XVII. The reader will observe that I call the arch mid-cusped, not when the cusped point
is in the middle of the curve of the arch, but when it is in the middle of the side piece,
and also that where the side pieces join the keystone there will be a change, perhaps somewhat
abrupt, in the curvature.

I have preferred to call the arch mid-cusped with respect to its side piece than with respect
to its own curve, because the most beautiful Gothic arches in the world, those of the Lombard
Gothic, have, in all the instances I have examined, a form more or less approximating to this
mid-cusped one at i (Plate III.), but having the curvature of the cusp carried up into the
keystone, as we shall see presently: where, however, the arch is built of many voussoirs, a
mid-cusped arch will mean one which has the point of the cusp midway between its own base and apex.

The Gothic arch of Venice is almost invariably up-cusped, as at k. The reader may note that,
in both down-cusped and up-cusped arches, the piece of stone, added to form the cusp, is of
the shape of a scymitar, held down in the one case and up in the other.

§ XVIII. Now, in the arches h, i, k, a slight modification has been made in the form of the
central piece, in order that it may continue the curve of the cusp. This modification is not
to be given to it in practice without considerable nicety of workmanship; and some curious
results took place in Venice from this difficulty.

At l (Plate III.) is the shape of the Venetian side stone, with its cusp detached from the
arch. Nothing can possibly be better or more graceful, or have the weight better disposed in
order to cause it to nod forwards against the keystone, as above explained, Ch. X. § II., where
I developed the whole system of the arch from three pieces, in order that the reader might
now clearly see the use of the weight of the cusp.

Now a Venetian Gothic palace has usually at least three stories; with perhaps ten or twelve
windows in each story, and this on two or three of its sides, requiring altogether some hundred
to a hundred and fifty side pieces.

I have no doubt, from observation of the way the windows are set together, that the side pieces
were carved in pairs, like hooks, of which the keystones were to be the eyes; that these side
pieces were ordered by the architect in the gross, and were used by him sometimes for wider,
sometimes for narrower windows; bevelling the two ends as required, fitting in keystones as
he best could, and now and then varying the arrangement by turning the side pieces upside down.

There were various conveniences in this way of working, one of the principal being that the
side pieces with their cusps were always cut to their complete form, and that no part of the
cusp was carried out into the keystone, which followed the curve of the outer arch itself.
The ornaments of the cusp might thus be worked without any troublesome reference to the rest
of the arch.

§ XIX. Now let us take a pair of side pieces, made to order, like that at l, and see what we
can make of them. We will try to fit them first with a keystone which continues the curve of
the outer arch, as at m. This the reader assuredly thinks an ugly arch. There are a great many
of them in Venice, the ugliest things there, and the Venetian builders quickly began to feel
them so. What could they do to better them? The arch at m has a central piece of the form r.
Substitute for it a piece of the form s, and we have the arch at n.

§ XX. This arch at n is not so strong as that at m; but, built of good marble, and with its
pieces of proper thickness, it is quite strong enough for all practical purposes on a small
scale. I have examined at least two thousand windows of this kind and of the other Venetian
ogees, of which that at y (in which the plain side-piece d is used instead of the cusped one)
is the simplest; and I never found one, even in the most ruinous palaces (in which they had
had to sustain the distorted weight of falling walls) in which the central piece was fissured;
and this is the only danger to which the window is exposed; in other respects it is as strong
an arch as can be built.

It is not to be supposed that the change from the r keystone to the s keystone was instantaneous.
It was a change wrought out by many curious experiments, which we shall have to trace hereafter,
and to throw the resultant varieties of form into their proper groups.

§ XXI. One step more: I take a mid-cusped side piece in its block form at t, with the bricks
which load the back of it. Now, as these bricks support it behind, and since, as far as the
use of the cusp is concerned, it matters not whether its weight be in marble or bricks, there
is nothing to hinder us from cutting out some of the marble, as at u, and filling up the space
with bricks. (Why we should take a fancy to do this, I do not pretend to guess at present;
all I have to assert is, that, if the fancy should strike us, there would be no harm in it).
Substituting this side piece for the other in the window n, we have that at w, which may, perhaps,
be of some service to us afterwards; here we have nothing more to do with it than to note that,
thus built, and properly backed by brickwork, it is just as strong and safe a form as that
at n; but that this, as well as every variety of ogee arch, depends entirely for its safety,
fitness, and beauty, on the masonry which we have just analysed; and that, built on a large
scale, and with many voussoirs, all such arches would be unsafe and absurd in general architecture.
Yet they may be used occasionally for the sake of the exquisite beauty of which their rich
and fantastic varieties admit, and sometimes for the sake of another merit, exactly the opposite
of the constructional ones we are at present examining, that they seem to stand by enchantment.

§ XXII. In the above reasonings, the inclination of the joints of the voussoirs to the curves
of the arch has not been considered. It is a question of much nicety, and which I have not
been able as yet fully to investigate: but the natural idea of the arrangement of these lines
(which in round arches are of course perpendicular to the curve) would be that every voussoir
should have the lengths of its outer and inner arched surface in the same proportion to each
other. Either this actual law, or a close approximation to it, is assuredly enforced in the
best Gothic buildings.

§ XXIII. I may sum up all that it is necessary for the reader to keep in mind of the general
laws connected with this subject, by giving him an example of each of the two forms of the
perfect Gothic arch, uncusped and cusped, treated with the most simple and magnificent masonry,
and partly, in both cases, Mont-Cenisian.

The first, Plate V., is a window from the Broletto of Como. It shows, in its filling, first,
the single-pieced arch, carried on groups of four shafts, and a single slab of marble filling
the space above, and pierced with a quatrefoil (Mont-Cenisian, this), while the mouldings above
are each constructed with a separate system of voussoirs, all of them shaped, I think, on the
principle above stated, § XXII., in alternate serpentine and marble; the outer arch being a
noble example of the pure uncusped Gothic construction, b of Plate III.

§ XXIV. Fig. XXXIV. is the masonry of the side arch of, as far as I know or am able to judge,
the most perfect Gothic sepulchral monument in the world, the foursquare canopy of the (nameless?)[49]
tomb standing over the small cemetery gate of the Church of St. Anastasia at Verona. I shall
have frequent occasion to recur to this monument, and, I believe, shall be able sufficiently
to justify the terms in which I speak of it: meanwhile, I desire only that the reader should
observe the severity and simplicity of the arch lines, the exquisitely delicate suggestion
of the ogee curve in the apex, and chiefly the use of the cusp in giving inward weight to the
great pieces of stone on the flanks of the arch, and preventing their thrust outwards from
being severely thrown on the lowermost stones. The effect of this arrangement is, that the
whole massy canopy is sustained safely by four slender pillars (as will be seen hereafter in
the careful plate I hope to give of it), these pillars being rather steadied than materially
assisted against the thrust, by iron bars, about an inch thick, connecting them at the heads
of the abaci; a feature of peculiar importance in this monument, inasmuch as we know it to
be part of the original construction, by a beautiful little Gothic wreathed pattern, like one
of the hems of garments of Fra Angelico, running along the iron bar itself. So carefully, and
so far, is the system of decoration carried out in this pure and lovely monument, my most beloved
throughout all the length and breadth of Italy;--chief, as I think, among all the sepulchral
marbles of a land of mourning.

FOOTNOTES:

  [49] At least I cannot find any account of it in Maffei's "Verona,"
    nor anywhere else, to be depended upon. It is, I doubt not, a work
    of the beginning of the thirteenth century. Vide Appendix 19, "Tombs
    at St. Anastasia."

CHAPTER XII.

  THE ARCH LOAD.

§ I. In the preceding enquiry we have always supposed either that the load upon the arch was
perfectly loose, as of gravel or sand, or that it was Mont-Cenisian, and formed one mass with
the arch voussoirs, of more or less compactness.

In practice, the state is usually something between the two. Over bridges and tunnels it sometimes
approaches to the condition of mere dust or yielding earth; but in architecture it is mostly
firm masonry, not altogether acting with the voussoirs, yet by no means bearing on them with
perfectly dead weight, but locking itself together above them, and capable of being thrown
into forms which relieve them, in some degree, from its pressure.

§ II. It is evident that if we are to place a continuous roof above the line of arches, we
must fill up the intervals between them on the tops of the columns. We have at present nothing
granted us but the bare masonry, as here at a, Fig. XXXV., and we must fill up the intervals
between the semicircle so as to obtain a level line of support. We may first do this simply
as at b, with plain mass of wall; so laying the roof on the top, which is the method of the
pure Byzantine and Italian Romanesque. But if we find too much stress is thus laid on the arches,
we may introduce small second shafts on the top of the great shaft, a, Fig. XXXVI., which may
assist in carrying the roof, conveying great part of its weight at once to the heads of the
main shafts, and relieving from its pressure the centres of the arches.

§ III. The new shaft thus introduced may either remain lifted on the head of the great shaft,
or may be carried to the ground in front of it, or through it, b, Fig. XXXVI.; in which latter
case the main shaft divides into two or more minor shafts, and forms a group with the shaft
brought down from above.

§ IV. When this shaft, brought from roof to ground, is subordinate to the main pier, and either
is carried down the face of it, or forms no large part of the group, the principle is Romanesque
or Gothic, b, Fig. XXXVI. When it becomes a bold central shaft, and the main pier splits into
two minor shafts on its sides, the principle is Classical or Palladian, c, Fig. XXXVI. Which
latter arrangement becomes absurd or unsatisfactory in proportion to the sufficiency of the
main shaft to carry the roof without the help of the minor shafts or arch, which in many instances
of Palladian work look as if they might be removed without danger to the building.

§ V. The form a is a more pure Northern Gothic type than even b, which is the connecting link
between it and the classical type. It is found chiefly in English and other northern Gothic,
and in early Lombardic, and is, I doubt not, derived as above explained, Chap. I. § XXVII.
b is a general French Gothic and French Romanesque form, as in great purity at Valence.

The small shafts of the form a and b, as being northern, are generally connected with steep
vaulted roofs, and receive for that reason the name of vaulting shafts.

§ VI. Of these forms b, Fig. XXXV., is the purest and most sublime, expressing the power of
the arch most distinctly. All the others have some appearance of dovetailing and morticing
of timber rather than stonework; nor have I ever yet seen a single instance, quite satisfactory,
of the management of the capital of the main shaft, when it had either to sustain the base
of the vaulting shaft, as in a, or to suffer it to pass through it, as in b, Fig. XXXVI. Nor
is the bracket which frequently carries the vaulting shaft in English work a fitting support
for a portion of the fabric which is at all events presumed to carry a considerable part of
the weight of the roof.

§ VII. The triangular spaces on the flanks of the arch are called Spandrils, and if the masonry
of these should be found, in any of its forms, too heavy for the arch, their weight may be
diminished, while their strength remains the same, by piercing them with circular holes or
lights. This is rarely necessary in ordinary architecture, though sometimes of great use in
bridges and iron roofs (a succession of such circles may be seen, for instance, in the spandrils
at the Euston Square station); but, from its constructional value, it becomes the best form
in which to arrange spandril decorations, as we shall see hereafter.

§ VIII. The height of the load above the arch is determined by the needs of the building and
possible length of the shaft; but with this we have at present nothing to do, for we have performed
the task which was set us. We have ascertained, as it was required that we should in § VI.
of Chap. III. (A), the construction of walls; (B), that of piers; (C), that of piers with lintels
or arches prepared for roofing. We have next, therefore, to examine (D) the structure of the roof.

CHAPTER XIII.

  THE ROOF.

§ I. Hitherto our enquiry has been unembarrassed by any considerations relating exclusively
either to the exterior or interior of buildings. But it can remain so no longer. As far as
the architect is concerned, one side of a wall is generally the same as another; but in the
roof there are usually two distinct divisions of the structure; one, a shell, vault, or flat
ceiling, internally visible, the other, an upper structure, built of timber, to protect the
lower; or of some different form, to support it. Sometimes, indeed, the internally visible
structure is the real roof, and sometimes there are more than two divisions, as in St. Paul's,
where we have a central shell with a mask below and above. Still it will be convenient to remember
the distinction between the part of the roof which is usually visible from within, and whose
only business is to stand strongly, and not fall in, which I shall call the Roof Proper; and,
secondly, the upper roof, which, being often partly supported by the lower, is not so much
concerned with its own stability as with the weather, and is appointed to throw off snow, and
get rid of rain, as fast as possible, which I shall call the Roof Mask.

§ II. It is, however, needless for me to engage the reader in the discussion of the various
methods of construction of Roofs Proper, for this simple reason, that no person without long
experience can tell whether a roof be wisely constructed or not; nor tell at all, even with
help of any amount of experience, without examination of the several parts and bearings of
it, very different from any observation possible to the general critic: and more than this,
the enquiry would be useless to us in our Venetian studies, where the roofs are either not
contemporary with the buildings, or flat, or else vaults of the simplest possible constructions,
which have been admirably explained by Willis in his "Architecture of the Middle Ages," Chap.
VII., to which I may refer the reader for all that it would be well for him to know respecting
the connexion of the different parts of the vault with the shafts. He would also do well to
read the passages on Tudor vaulting, pp. 185-193, in Mr. Garbett's rudimentary Treatise on
Design, before alluded to.[50] I shall content myself therefore with noting one or two points
on which neither writer has had occasion to touch, respecting the Roof Mask.

§ III. It was said in § V. of Chapter III. that we should not have occasion, in speaking of
roof construction, to add materially to the forms then suggested. The forms which we have to
add are only those resulting from the other curves of the arch developed in the last chapter;
that is to say, the various eastern domes and cupolas arising out of the revolution of the
horseshoe and ogee curves, together with the well-known Chinese concave roof. All these forms
are of course purely decorative, the bulging outline, or concave surface, being of no more
use, or rather of less, in throwing off snow or rain, than the ordinary spire and gable; and
it is rather curious, therefore, that all of them, on a small scale, should have obtained so
extensive use in Germany and Switzerland, their native climate being that of the east, where
their purpose seems rather to concentrate light upon their orbed surfaces. I much doubt their
applicability, on a large scale, to architecture of any admirable dignity; their chief charm
is, to the European eye, that of strangeness; and it seems to me possible that in the east
the bulging form may be also delightful, from the idea of its enclosing a volume of cool air.
I enjoy them in St. Mark's, chiefly because they increase the fantastic and unreal character
of St. Mark's Place; and because they appear to sympathise with an expression, common, I think,
to all the buildings of that group, of a natural buoyancy, as if they floated in the air or
on the surface of the sea. But, assuredly, they are not features to be recommended for imitation.[51]

§ IV. One form, closely connected with the Chinese concave, is, however, often constructively
right,--the gable with an inward angle, occurring with exquisitely picturesque effect throughout
the domestic architecture of the north, especially Germany and Switzerland; the lower slope
being either an attached external penthouse roof, for protection of the wall, as in Fig. XXXVII.,
or else a kind of buttress set on the angle of the tower; and in either case the roof itself
being a simple gable, continuous beneath it.

§ V. The true gable, as it is the simplest and most natural, so I esteem it the grandest of
roofs; whether rising in ridgy darkness, like a grey slope of slaty mountains, over the precipitous
walls of the northern cathedrals, or stretched in burning breadth above the white and square-set
groups of the southern architecture. But this difference between its slope in the northern
and southern structure is a matter of far greater importance than is commonly supposed, and
it is this to which I would especially direct the reader's attention.

§ VI. One main cause of it, the necessity of throwing off snow in the north, has been a thousand
times alluded to: another I do not remember having seen noticed, namely, that rooms in a roof
are comfortably habitable in the north, which are painful sotto piombi in Italy; and that there
is in wet climates a natural tendency in all men to live as high as possible, out of the damp
and mist. These two causes, together with accessible quantities of good timber, have induced
in the north a general steep pitch of gable, which, when rounded or squared above a tower,
becomes a spire or turret; and this feature, worked out with elaborate decoration, is the key-note
of the whole system of aspiration, so called, which the German critics have so ingeniously
and falsely ascribed to a devotional sentiment pervading the Northern Gothic: I entirely and
boldly deny the whole theory; our cathedrals were for the most part built by worldly people,
who loved the world, and would have gladly staid in it for ever; whose best hope was the escaping
hell, which they thought to do by building cathedrals, but who had very vague conceptions of
Heaven in general, and very feeble desires respecting their entrance therein; and the form
of the spired cathedral has no more intentional reference to Heaven, as distinguished from
the flattened slope of the Greek pediment, than the steep gable of a Norman house has, as distinguished
from the flat roof of a Syrian one. We may now, with ingenious pleasure, trace such symbolic
characters in the form; we may now use it with such definite meaning; but we only prevent ourselves
from all right understanding of history, by attributing much influence to these poetical symbolisms
in the formation of a national style. The human race are, for the most part, not to be moved
by such silken cords; and the chances of damp in the cellar, or of loose tiles in the roof,
have, unhappily, much more to do with the fashions of a man's house building than his ideas
of celestial happiness or angelic virtue. Associations of affection have far higher power,
and forms which can be no otherwise accounted for may often be explained by reference to the
natural features of the country, or to anything which habit must have rendered familiar, and
therefore delightful; but the direct symbolisation of a sentiment is a weak motive with all
men, and far more so in the practical minds of the north than among the early Christians, who
were assuredly quite as heavenly-minded, when they built basilicas, or cut conchas out of the
catacombs, as were ever the Norman barons or monks.

§ VII. There is, however, in the north an animal activity which materially aided the system
of building begun in mere utility,--an animal life, naturally expressed in erect work, as the
languor of the south in reclining or level work. Imagine the difference between the action
of a man urging himself to his work in a snow storm, and the inaction of one laid at his length
on a sunny bank among cicadas and fallen olives, and you will have the key to a whole group
of sympathies which were forcefully expressed in the architecture of both; remembering always
that sleep would be to the one luxury, to the other death.

§ VIII. And to the force of this vital instinct we have farther to add the influence of natural
scenery; and chiefly of the groups and wildernesses of the tree which is to the German mind
what the olive or palm is to the southern, the spruce fir. The eye which has once been habituated
to the continual serration of the pine forest, and to the multiplication of its infinite pinnacles,
is not easily offended by the repetition of similar forms, nor easily satisfied by the simplicity
of flat or massive outlines. Add to the influence of the pine, that of the poplar, more especially
in the valleys of France; but think of the spruce chiefly, and meditate on the difference of
feeling with which the Northman would be inspired by the frostwork wreathed upon its glittering
point, and the Italian by the dark green depth of sunshine on the broad table of the stone-pine[52]
(and consider by the way whether the spruce fir be a more heavenly-minded tree than those dark
canopies of the Mediterranean isles).

§ IX. Circumstance and sentiment, therefore, aiding each other, the steep roof becomes generally
adopted, and delighted in, throughout the north; and then, with the gradual exaggeration with
which every pleasant idea is pursued by the human mind, it is raised into all manner of peaks,
and points, and ridges; and pinnacle after pinnacle is added on its flanks, and the walls increased
in height, in proportion, until we get indeed a very sublime mass, but one which has no more
principle of religious aspiration in it than a child's tower of cards. What is more, the desire
to build high is complicated with the peculiar love of the grotesque[53] which is characteristic
of the north, together with especial delight in multiplication of small forms, as well as in
exaggerated points of shade and energy, and a certain degree of consequent insensibility to
perfect grace and quiet truthfulness; so that a northern architect could not feel the beauty
of the Elgin marbles, and there will always be (in those who have devoted themselves to this
particular school) a certain incapacity to taste the finer characters of Greek art, or to understand
Titian, Tintoret, or Raphael: whereas among the Italian Gothic workmen, this capacity was never
lost, and Nino Pisano and Orcagna could have understood the Theseus in an instant, and would
have received from it new life. There can be no question that theirs was the greatest school,
and carried out by the greatest men; and that while those who began with this school could
perfectly well feel Rouen Cathedral, those who study the Northern Gothic remain in a narrowed
field--one of small pinnacles, and dots, and crockets, and twitched faces--and cannot comprehend
the meaning of a broad surface or a grand line. Nevertheless the northern school is an admirable
and delightful thing, but a lower thing than the southern. The Gothic of the Ducal Palace of
Venice is in harmony with all that is grand in all the world: that of the north is in harmony
with the grotesque northern spirit only.

§ X. We are, however, beginning to lose sight of our roof structure in its spirit, and must
return to our text. As the height of the walls increased, in sympathy with the rise of the
roof, while their thickness remained the same, it became more and more necessary to support
them by buttresses; but--and this is another point that the reader must specially note--it
is not the steep roof mask which requires the buttress, but the vaulting beneath it; the roof
mask being a mere wooden frame tied together by cross timbers, and in small buildings often
put together on the ground, raised afterwards, and set on the walls like a hat, bearing vertically
upon them; and farther, I believe in most cases the northern vaulting requires its great array
of external buttress, not so much from any peculiar boldness in its own forms, as from the
greater comparative thinness and height of the walls, and more determined throwing of the whole
weight of the roof on particular points. Now the connexion of the interior frame-work (or true
roof) with the buttress, at such points, is not visible to the spectators from without; but
the relation of the roof mask to the top of the wall which it protects, or from which it springs,
is perfectly visible; and it is a point of so great importance in the effect of the building,
that it will be well to make it a subject of distinct consideration in the following Chapter.

  [50] Appendix 17

  [51] I do not speak of the true dome, because I have not studied its
    construction enough to know at what largeness of scale it begins to
    be rather a tour de force than a convenient or natural form of
    roof, and because the ordinary spectator's choice among its various
    outlines must always be dependent on æsthetic considerations only,
    and can in no wise be grounded on any conception of its infinitely
    complicated structural principles.

  [52] I shall not be thought to have overrated the effect of forest
    scenery on the northern mind; but I was glad to hear a Spanish
    gentleman, the other day, describing, together with his own, the
    regret which the peasants in his neighborhood had testified for the
    loss of a noble stone-pine, one of the grandest in Spain, which its
    proprietor had suffered to be cut down for small gain. He said that
    the mere spot where it had grown was still popularly known as "El
    Pino."

CHAPTER XIV.

  THE ROOF CORNICE.

§ I. It will be remembered that in the Sixth Chapter we paused (§ X.) at the point where the
addition of brackets to the ordinary wall cornice would have converted it into a structure
proper for sustaining a roof. Now the wall cornice was treated throughout our enquiry (compare
Chapter VII. § V.) as the capital of the wall, and as forming, by its concentration, the capital
of the shaft. But we must not reason back from the capital to the cornice, and suppose that
an extension of the principles of the capital to the whole length of the wall, will serve for
the roof cornice; for all our conclusions respecting the capital were based on the supposition
of its being adapted to carry considerable weight condensed on its abacus: but the roof cornice
is, in most cases, required rather to project boldly than to carry weight; and arrangements
are therefore to be adopted for it which will secure the projection of large surfaces without
being calculated to resist extraordinary pressure. This object is obtained by the use of brackets
at intervals, which are the peculiar distinction of the roof cornice.

§ II. Roof cornices are generally to be divided into two great families: the first and simplest,
those which are composed merely by the projection of the edge of the roof mask over the wall,
sustained by such brackets or spurs as may be necessary; the second, those which provide a
walk round the edge of the roof, and which require, therefore, some stronger support, as well
as a considerable mass of building above or beside the roof mask, and a parapet. These two
families we shall consider in succession.

§ III. 1. The Eaved Cornice. We may give it this name, as represented in the simplest form
by cottage eaves. It is used, however, in bold projection, both in north, and south, and east;
its use being, in the north, to throw the rain well away from the wall of the building; in
the south to give it shade; and it is ordinarily constructed of the ends of the timbers of
the roof mask (with their tiles or shingles continued to the edge of the cornice), and sustained
by spurs of timber. This is its most picturesque and natural form; not inconsistent with great
splendor of architecture in the mediæval Italian domestic buildings, superb in its mass of
cast shadow, and giving rich effect to the streets of Swiss towns, even when they have no other
claim to interest. A farther value is given to it by its waterspouts, for in order to avoid
loading it with weight of water in the gutter at the edge, where it would be a strain on the
fastenings of the pipe, it has spouts of discharge at intervals of three or four feet,--rows
of magnificent leaden or iron dragons' heads, full of delightful character, except to any person
passing along the middle of the street in a heavy shower. I have had my share of their kindness
in my time, but owe them no grudge; on the contrary, much gratitude for the delight of their
fantastic outline on the calm blue sky, when they had no work to do but to open their iron
mouths and pant in the sunshine.

§ IV. When, however, light is more valuable than shadow, or when the architecture of the wall
is too fair to be concealed, it becomes necessary to draw the cornice into narrower limits;
a change of considerable importance, in that it permits the gutter, instead of being of lead
and hung to the edge of the cornice, to be of stone, and supported by brackets in the wall,
these brackets becoming proper recipients of after decoration (and sometimes associated with
the stone channels of discharge, called gargoyles, which belong, however, more properly to
the other family of cornices). The most perfect and beautiful example of this kind of cornice
is the Venetian, in which the rain from the tiles is received in a stone gutter supported by
small brackets, delicately moulded, and having its outer lower edge decorated with the English
dogtooth moulding, whose sharp zigzag mingles richly with the curved edges of the tiling. I
know no cornice more beautiful in its extreme simplicity and serviceableness.

§ V. The cornice of the Greek Doric is a condition of the same kind, in which, however, there
are no brackets, but useless appendages hung to the bottom of the gutter (giving, however,
some impression of support as seen from a distance), and decorated with stone symbolisms of
raindrops. The brackets are not allowed, because they would interfere with the sculpture, which
in this architecture is put beneath the cornice; and the overhanging form of the gutter is
nothing more than a vast dripstone moulding, to keep the rain from such sculpture: its decoration
of guttæ, seen in silver points against the shadow, is pretty in feeling, with a kind of continual
refreshment and remembrance of rain in it; but the whole arrangement is awkward and meagre,
and is only endurable when the eye is quickly drawn away from it to sculpture.

§ VI. In later cornices, invented for the Greek orders, and farther developed by the Romans,
the bracket appears in true importance, though of barbarous and effeminate outline: and gorgeous
decorations are applied to it, and to the various horizontal mouldings which it carries, some
of them of great beauty, and of the highest value to the mediæval architects who imitated them.
But a singularly gross mistake was made in the distribution of decoration on these rich cornices
(I do not know when first, nor does it matter to me or to the reader), namely, the charging
with ornament the under surface of the cornice between the brackets, that is to say, the exact
piece of the whole edifice, from top to bottom, where ornament is least visible. I need hardly
say much respecting the wisdom of this procedure, excusable only if the whole building were
covered with ornament; but it is curious to see the way in which modern architects have copied
it, even when they had little enough ornament to spare. For instance, I suppose few persons
look at the Athenæum Club-house without feeling vexed at the meagreness and meanness of the
windows of the ground floor: if, however, they look up under the cornice, and have good eyes,
they will perceive that the architect has reserved his decorations to put between the brackets;
and by going up to the first floor, and out on the gallery, they may succeed in obtaining some
glimpses of the designs of the said decorations.

§ VII. Such as they are, or were, these cornices were soon considered essential parts of the
"order" to which they belonged; and the same wisdom which endeavored to fix the proportions
of the orders, appointed also that no order should go without its cornice. The reader has probably
heard of the architectural division of superstructure into architrave, frieze, and cornice;
parts which have been appointed by great architects to all their work, in the same spirit in
which great rhetoricians have ordained that every speech shall have an exordium, and narration,
and peroration. The reader will do well to consider that it may be sometimes just as possible
to carry a roof, and get rid of rain, without such an arrangement, as it is to tell a plain
fact without an exordium or peroration; but he must very absolutely consider that the architectural
peroration or cornice is strictly and sternly limited to the end of the wall's speech,--that
is, to the edge of the roof; and that it has nothing whatever to do with shafts nor the orders
of them. And he will then be able fully to enjoy the farther ordinance of the late Roman and
Renaissance architects, who, attaching it to the shaft as if it were part of its shadow, and
having to employ their shafts often in places where they came not near the roof, forthwith
cut the roof-cornice to pieces and attached a bit of it to every column; thenceforward to be
carried by the unhappy shaft wherever it went, in addition to any other work on which it might
happen to be employed. I do not recollect among any living beings, except Renaissance architects,
any instance of a parallel or comparable stupidity: but one can imagine a savage getting hold
of a piece of one of our iron wire ropes, with its rings upon it at intervals to bind it together,
and pulling the wires asunder to apply them to separate purposes; but imagining there was magic
in the ring that bound them, and so cutting that to pieces also, and fastening a little bit
of it to every wire.

§ VIII. Thus much may serve us to know respecting the first family of wall cornices. The second
is immeasurably more important, and includes the cornices of all the best buildings in the
world. It has derived its best form from mediæval military architecture, which imperatively
required two things; first, a parapet which should permit sight and offence, and afford defence
at the same time; and secondly, a projection bold enough to enable the defenders to rake the
bottom of the wall with falling bodies; projection which, if the wall happened to slope inwards,
required not to be small. The thoroughly magnificent forms of cornice thus developed by necessity
in military buildings, were adopted, with more or less of boldness or distinctness, in domestic
architecture, according to the temper of the times and the circumstances of the individual--decisively
in the baron's house, imperfectly in the burgher's: gradually they found their way into ecclesiastical
architecture, under wise modifications in the early cathedrals, with infinite absurdity in
the imitations of them; diminishing in size as their original purpose sank into a decorative
one, until we find battlements, two-and-a-quarter inches square, decorating the gates of the
Philanthropic Society.

§ IX. There are, therefore, two distinct features in all cornices of this kind; first, the
bracket, now become of enormous importance and of most serious practical service; the second,
the parapet: and these two features we shall consider in succession, and in so doing, shall
learn all that is needful for us to know, not only respecting cornices, but respecting brackets
in general, and balconies.

§ X. 1. The Bracket. In the simplest form of military cornice, the brackets are composed of
two or more long stones, supporting each other in gradually increasing projection, with roughly
rounded ends, Fig. XXXVIII., and the parapet is simply a low wall carried on the ends of these,
leaving, of course, behind, or within it, a hole between each bracket for the convenient dejection
of hot sand and lead. This form is best seen, I think, in the old Scotch castles; it is very
grand, but has a giddy look, and one is afraid of the whole thing toppling off the wall. The
next step was to deepen the brackets, so as to get them propped against a great depth of the
main rampart, and to have the inner ends of the stones held by a greater weight of that main
wall above; while small arches were thrown from bracket to bracket to carry the parapet wall
more securely. This is the most perfect form of cornice, completely satisfying the eye of its
security, giving full protection to the wall, and applicable to all architecture, the interstices
between the brackets being filled up, when one does not want to throw boiling lead on any body
below, and the projection being always delightful, as giving greater command and view of the
building, from its angles, to those walking on the rampart. And as, in military buildings,
there were usually towers at the angles (round which the battlements swept) in order to flank
the walls, so often in the translation into civil or ecclesiastical architecture, a small turret
remained at the angle, or a more bold projection of balcony, to give larger prospect to those
upon the rampart. This cornice, perfect in all its parts, as arranged for ecclesiastical architecture,
and exquisitely decorated, is the one employed in the duomo of Florence and campanile of Giotto,
of which I have already spoken as, I suppose, the most perfect architecture in the world.

§ XI. In less important positions and on smaller edifices, this cornice diminishes in size,
while it retains its arrangement, and at last we find nothing but the spirit and form of it
left; the real practical purpose having ceased, and arch, brackets and all, being cut out of
a single stone. Thus we find it used in early buildings throughout the whole of the north and
south of Europe, in forms sufficiently represented by the two examples in Plate IV.: 1, from
St. Antonio, Padua; 2, from Sens in France.

§ XII. I wish, however, at present to fix the reader's attention on the form of the bracket
itself; a most important feature in modern as well as ancient architecture. The first idea
of a bracket is that of a long stone or piece of timber projecting from the wall, as a, Fig.
XXXIX., of which the strength depends on the toughness of the stone or wood, and the stability
on the weight of wall above it (unless it be the end of a main beam). But let it be supposed
that the structure at a, being of the required projection, is found too weak: then we may strengthen
it in one of three ways; (1) by putting a second or third stone beneath it, as at b; (2) by
giving it a spur, as at c; (3) by giving it a shaft and another bracket below, d; the great
use of this arrangement being that the lowermost bracket has the help of the weight of the
shaft-length of wall above its insertion, which is, of course, greater than the weight of the
small shaft: and then the lower bracket may be farther helped by the structure at b or c.

§ XIII. Of these structures, a and c are evidently adapted especially for wooden buildings;
b and d for stone ones; the last, of course, susceptible of the richest decoration, and superbly
employed in the cornice of the cathedral of Monza: but all are beautiful in their way, and
are the means of, I think, nearly half the picturesqueness and power of mediæval building;
the forms b and c being, of course, the most frequent; a, when it occurs, being usually rounded
off, as at a, Fig. XL.; b, also, as in Fig. XXXVIII., or else itself composed of a single stone
cut into the form of the group b here, Fig. XL., or plain, as at c, which is also the proper
form of the brick bracket, when stone is not to be had. The reader will at once perceive that
the form d is a barbarism (unless when the scale is small and the weight to be carried exceedingly
light): it is of course, therefore, a favorite form with the Renaissance architects; and its
introduction is one of the first corruptions of the Venetian architecture.

§ XIV. There is one point necessary to be noticed, though bearing on decoration more than construction,
before we leave the subject of the bracket. The whole power of the construction depends upon
the stones being well let into the wall; and the first function of the decoration should be
to give the idea of this insertion, if possible; at all events, not to contradict this idea.
If the reader will glance at any of the brackets used in the ordinary architecture of London,
he will find them of some such character as Fig. XLI.; not a bad form in itself, but exquisitely
absurd in its curling lines, which give the idea of some writhing suspended tendril, instead
of a stiff support, and by their careful avoidance of the wall make the bracket look pinned
on, and in constant danger of sliding down. This is, also, a Classical and Renaissance decoration.

§ XV. 2. The Parapet. Its forms are fixed in military architecture by the necessities of the
art of war at the time of building, and are always beautiful wherever they have been really
thus fixed; delightful in the variety of their setting, and in the quaint darkness of their
shot-holes, and fantastic changes of elevation and outline. Nothing is more remarkable than
the swiftly discerned difference between the masculine irregularity of such true battlements,
and the formal pitifulness of those which are set on modern buildings to give them a military
air,--as on the jail at Edinburgh.

§ XVI. Respecting the Parapet for mere safeguard upon buildings not military, there are just
two fixed laws. It should be pierced, otherwise it is not recognised from below for a parapet
at all, and it should not be in the form of a battlement, especially in church architecture.

The most comfortable heading of a true parapet is a plain level on which the arm can be rested,
and along which it can glide. Any jags or elevations are disagreeable; the latter, as interrupting
the view and disturbing the eye, if they are higher than the arm, the former, as opening some
aspect of danger if they are much lower; and the inconvenience, therefore, of the battlemented
form, as well as the worse than absurdity, the bad feeling, of the appliance of a military
feature to a church, ought long ago to have determined its rejection. Still (for the question
of its picturesque value is here so closely connected with that of its practical use, that
it is vain to endeavor to discuss it separately) there is a certain agreeableness in the way
in which the jagged outline dovetails the shadow of the slated or leaded roof into the top
of the wall, which may make the use of the battlement excusable where there is a difficulty
in managing some unvaried line, and where the expense of a pierced parapet cannot be encountered:
but remember always, that the value of the battlement consists in its letting shadow into the
light of the wall, or vice versâ, when it comes against light sky, letting the light of the
sky into the shade of the wall; but that the actual outline of the parapet itself, if the eye
be arrested upon this, instead of upon the alternation of shadow, is as ugly a succession of
line as can by any possibility be invented. Therefore, the battlemented parapet may only be
used where this alternation of shade is certain to be shown, under nearly all conditions of
effect; and where the lines to be dealt with are on a scale which may admit battlements of
bold and manly size. The idea that a battlement is an ornament anywhere, and that a miserable
and diminutive imitation of castellated outline will always serve to fill up blanks and Gothicise
unmanageable spaces, is one of the great idiocies of the present day. A battlement is in its
origin a piece of wall large enough to cover a man's body, and however it may be decorated,
or pierced, or finessed away into traceries, as long as so much of its outline is retained
as to suggest its origin, so long its size must remain undiminished. To crown a turret six
feet high with chopped battlements three inches wide, is children's Gothic: it is one of the
paltry falsehoods for which there is no excuse, and part of the system of using models of architecture
to decorate architecture, which we shall hereafter note as one of the chief and most destructive
follies of the Renaissance;[54] and in the present day the practice may be classed as one which
distinguishes the architects of whom there is no hope, who have neither eye nor head for their
work, and who must pass their lives in vain struggles against the refractory lines of their
own buildings.

§ XVII. As the only excuse for the battlemented parapet is its alternation of shadow, so the
only fault of the natural or level parapet is its monotony of line. This is, however, in practice,
almost always broken by the pinnacles of the buttresses, and if not, may be varied by the tracery
of its penetrations. The forms of these evidently admit every kind of change; for a stone parapet,
however pierced, is sure to be strong enough for its purpose of protection, and, as regards
the strength of the building in general, the lighter it is the better. More fantastic forms
may, therefore, be admitted in a parapet than in any other architectural feature, and for most
services, the Flamboyant parapets seem to me preferable to all others; especially when the
leaden roofs set off by points of darkness the lace-like intricacy of penetration. These, however,
as well as the forms usually given to Renaissance balustrades (of which, by the bye, the best
piece of criticism I know is the sketch in "David Copperfield" of the personal appearance of
the man who stole Jip), and the other and finer forms invented by Paul Veronese in his architectural
backgrounds, together with the pure columnar balustrade of Venice, must be considered as altogether
decorative features.

§ XVIII. So also are, of course, the jagged or crown-like finishings of walls employed where
no real parapet of protection is desired; originating in the defences of outworks and single
walls: these are used much in the east on walls surrounding unroofed courts. The richest examples
of such decoration are Arabian; and from Cairo they seem to have been brought to Venice. It
is probable that few of my readers, however familiar the general form of the Ducal Palace may
have been rendered to them by innumerable drawings, have any distinct idea of its roof, owing
to the staying of the eye on its superb parapet, of which we shall give account hereafter.
In most of the Venetian cases the parapets which surround roofing are very sufficient for protection,
except that the stones of which they are composed appear loose and infirm: but their purpose
is entirely decorative; every wall, whether detached or roofed, being indiscriminately fringed
with Arabic forms of parapet, more or less Gothicised, according to the lateness of their date.

I think there is no other point of importance requiring illustration respecting the roof itself,
or its cornice: but this Venetian form of ornamental parapet connects itself curiously, at
the angles of nearly all the buildings on which it occurs, with the pinnacled system of the
north, founded on the structure of the buttress. This, it will be remembered, is to be the
subject of the fifth division of our inquiry.

FOOTNOTES:

  [54] Not of Renaissance alone: the practice of modelling buildings
    on a minute scale for niches and tabernacle-work has always been
    more or less admitted, and I suppose authority for diminutive
    battlements might be gathered from the Gothic of almost every
    period, as well as for many other faults and mistakes: no Gothic
    school having ever been thoroughly systematised or perfected, even
    in its best times. But that a mistaken decoration sometimes occurs
    among a crowd of noble ones, is no more an excuse for the
    habitual--far less, the exclusive--use of such a decoration, than
    the accidental or seeming misconstructions of a Greek chorus are an
    excuse for a school boy's ungrammatical exercise.

CHAPTER XV.

  THE BUTTRESS.

§ I. We have hitherto supposed ourselves concerned with the support of vertical pressure only;
and the arch and roof have been considered as forms of abstract strength, without reference
to the means by which their lateral pressure was to be resisted. Few readers will need now
to be reminded, that every arch or gable not tied at its base by beams or bars, exercises a
lateral pressure upon the walls which sustain it,--pressure which may, indeed, be met and sustained
by increasing the thickness of the wall or vertical piers, and which is in reality thus met
in most Italian buildings, but may, with less expenditure of material, and with (perhaps) more
graceful effect, be met by some particular application of the provisions against lateral pressure
called Buttresses. These, therefore, we are next to examine.

§ II. Buttresses are of many kinds, according to the character and direction of the lateral
forces they are intended to resist. But their first broad division is into buttresses which
meet and break the force before it arrives at the wall, and buttresses which stand on the lee
side of the wall, and prop it against the force.

The lateral forces which walls have to sustain are of three distinct kinds: dead weight, as
of masonry or still water; moving weight, as of wind or running water; and sudden concussion,
as of earthquakes, explosions, &c.

Clearly, dead weight can only be resisted by the buttress acting as a prop; for a buttress
on the side of, or towards the weight, would only add to its effect. This, then, forms the
first great class of buttressed architecture; lateral thrusts, of roofing or arches, being
met by props of masonry outside--the thrust from within, the prop without; or the crushing
force of water on a ship's side met by its cross timbers--the thrust here from without the
wall, the prop within.

Moving weight may, of course, be resisted by the prop on the lee side of the wall, but is often
more effectually met, on the side which is attacked, by buttresses of peculiar forms, cunning
buttresses, which do not attempt to sustain the weight, but parry it, and throw it off in directions
clear of the wall.

Thirdly: concussions and vibratory motion, though in reality only supported by the prop buttress,
must be provided for by buttresses on both sides of the wall, as their direction cannot be
foreseen, and is continually changing.

We shall briefly glance at these three systems of buttressing; but the two latter being of
small importance to our present purpose, may as well be dismissed first.

§ III. 1. Buttresses for guard against moving weight and set towards the weight they resist.

The most familiar instance of this kind of buttress we have in the sharp piers of a bridge,
in the centre of a powerful stream, which divide the current on their edges, and throw it to
each side under the arches. A ship's bow is a buttress of the same kind, and so also the ridge
of a breastplate, both adding to the strength of it in resisting a cross blow, and giving a
better chance of a bullet glancing aside. In Switzerland, projecting buttresses of this kind
are often built round churches, heading up hill, to divide and throw off the avalanches. The
various forms given to piers and harbor quays, and to the bases of light-houses, in order to
meet the force of the waves, are all conditions of this kind of buttress. But in works of ornamental
architecture such buttresses are of rare occurrence; and I merely name them in order to mark
their place in our architectural system, since in the investigation of our present subject
we shall not meet with a single example of them, unless sometimes the angle of the foundation
of a palace set against the sweep of the tide, or the wooden piers of some canal bridge quivering
in its current.

§ IV. 2. Buttresses for guard against vibratory motion.

The whole formation of this kind of buttress resolves itself into mere expansion of the base
of the wall, so as to make it stand steadier, as a man stands with his feet apart when he is
likely to lose his balance. This approach to a pyramidal form is also of great use as a guard
against the action of artillery; that if a stone or tier of stones be battered out of the lower
portions of the wall, the whole upper part may not topple over or crumble down at once. Various
forms of this buttress, sometimes applied to particular points of the wall, sometimes forming
a great sloping rampart along its base, are frequent in buildings of countries exposed to earthquake.
They give a peculiarly heavy outline to much of the architecture of the kingdom of Naples,
and they are of the form in which strength and solidity are first naturally sought, in the
slope of the Egyptian wall. The base of Guy's Tower at Warwick is a singularly bold example
of their military use; and so, in general, bastion and rampart profiles, where, however, the
object of stability against a shock is complicated with that of sustaining weight of earth
in the rampart behind.

§ V. 3. Prop buttresses against dead weight.

This is the group with which we have principally to do; and a buttress of this kind acts in
two ways, partly by its weight and partly by its strength. It acts by its weight when its mass
is so great that the weight it sustains cannot stir it, but is lost upon it, buried in it,
and annihilated: neither the shape of such a buttress nor the cohesion of its materials are
of much consequence; a heap of stones or sandbags, laid up against the wall, will answer as
well as a built and cemented mass.

But a buttress acting by its strength is not of mass sufficient to resist the weight by mere
inertia; but it conveys the weight through its body to something else which is so capable;
as, for instance, a man leaning against a door with his hands, and propping himself against
the ground, conveys the force which would open or close the door against him through his body
to the ground. A buttress acting in this way must be of perfectly coherent materials, and so
strong that though the weight to be borne could easily move it, it cannot break it: this kind
of buttress may be called a conducting buttress. Practically, however, the two modes of action
are always in some sort united. Again, the weight to be borne may either act generally on the
whole wall surface, or with excessive energy on particular points: when it acts on the whole
wall surface, the whole wall is generally supported; and the arrangement becomes a continuous
rampart, as a dyke, or bank of reservoir.

§ VI. It is, however, very seldom that lateral force in architecture is equally distributed.
In most cases the weight of the roof, or the force of any lateral thrust, are more or less
confined to certain points and directions. In an early state of architectural science this
definiteness of direction is not yet clear, and it is met by uncertain application of mass
or strength in the buttress, sometimes by mere thickening of the wall into square piers, which
are partly piers, partly buttresses, as in Norman keeps and towers. But as science advances,
the weight to be borne is designedly and decisively thrown upon certain points; the direction
and degree of the forces which are then received are exactly calculated, and met by conducting
buttresses of the smallest possible dimensions; themselves, in their turn, supported by vertical
buttresses acting by weight, and these perhaps, in their turn, by another set of conducting
buttresses: so that, in the best examples of such arrangements, the weight to be borne may
be considered as the shock of an electric fluid, which, by a hundred different rods and channels,
is divided and carried away into the ground.

§ VII. In order to give greater weight to the vertical buttress piers which sustain the conducting
buttresses, they are loaded with pinnacles, which, however, are, I believe, in all the buildings
in which they become very prominent, merely decorative: they are of some use, indeed, by their
weight; but if this were all for which they were put there, a few cubic feet of lead would
much more securely answer the purpose, without any danger from exposure to wind. If the reader
likes to ask any Gothic architect with whom he may happen to be acquainted, to substitute a
lump of lead for his pinnacles, he will see by the expression of his face how far he considers
the pinnacles decorative members. In the work which seems to me the great type of simple and
masculine buttress structure, the apse of Beauvais, the pinnacles are altogether insignificant,
and are evidently added just as exclusively to entertain the eye and lighten the aspect of
the buttress, as the slight shafts which are set on its angles; while in other very noble Gothic
buildings the pinnacles are introduced as niches for statues, without any reference to construction
at all: and sometimes even, as in the tomb of Can Signoria at Verona, on small piers detached
from the main building.

§ VIII. I believe, therefore, that the development of the pinnacle is merely a part of the
general erectness and picturesqueness of northern work above alluded to: and that, if there
had been no other place for the pinnacles, the Gothic builders would have put them on the tops
of their arches (they often did on the tops of gables and pediments), rather than not have
had them; but the natural position of the pinnacle is, of course, where it adds to, rather
than diminishes, the stability of the building; that is to say, on its main wall piers and
the vertical piers at the buttresses. And thus the edifice is surrounded at last by a complete
company of detached piers and pinnacles, each sustaining an inclined prop against the central
wall, and looking something like a band of giants holding it up with the butts of their lances.
This arrangement would imply the loss of an enormous space of ground, but the intervals of
the buttresses are usually walled in below, and form minor chapels.

§ IX. The science of this arrangement has made it the subject of much enthusiastic declamation
among the Gothic architects, almost as unreasonable, in some respects, as the declamation of
the Renaissance architects respecting Greek structure. The fact is, that the whole northern
buttress system is based on the grand requirement of tall windows and vast masses of light
at the end of the apse. In order to gain this quantity of light, the piers between the windows
are diminished in thickness until they are far too weak to bear the roof, and then sustained
by external buttresses. In the Italian method the light is rather dreaded than desired, and
the wall is made wide enough between the windows to bear the roof, and so left. In fact, the
simplest expression of the difference in the systems is, that a northern apse is a southern
one with its inter-fenestrial piers set edgeways. Thus, a, Fig. XLII., is the general idea
of the southern apse; take it to pieces, and set all its piers edgeways, as at b, and you have
the northern one. You gain much light for the interior, but you cut the exterior to pieces,
and instead of a bold rounded or polygonal surface, ready for any kind of decoration, you have
a series of dark and damp cells, which no device that I have yet seen has succeeded in decorating
in a perfectly satisfactory manner. If the system be farther carried, and a second or third
order of buttresses be added, the real fact is that we have a building standing on two or three
rows of concentric piers, with the roof off the whole of it except the central circle, and
only ribs left, to carry the weight of the bit of remaining roof in the middle; and after the
eye has been accustomed to the bold and simple rounding of the Italian apse, the skeleton character
of the disposition is painfully felt. After spending some months in Venice, I thought Bourges
Cathedral looked exactly like a half-built ship on its shores. It is useless, however, to dispute
respecting the merits of the two systems: both are noble in their place; the Northern decidedly
the most scientific, or at least involving the greatest display of science, the Italian the
calmest and purest, this having in it the sublimity of a calm heaven or a windless noon, the
other that of a mountain flank tormented by the north wind, and withering into grisly furrows
of alternate chasm and crag.

§ X. If I have succeeded in making the reader understand the veritable action of the buttress,
he will have no difficulty in determining its fittest form. He has to deal with two distinct
kinds; one, a narrow vertical pier, acting principally by its weight, and crowned by a pinnacle;
the other, commonly called a Flying buttress, a cross bar set from such a pier (when detached
from the building) against the main wall. This latter, then, is to be considered as a mere
prop or shore, and its use by the Gothic architects might be illustrated by the supposition
that we were to build all our houses with walls too thin to stand without wooden props outside,
and then to substitute stone props for wooden ones. I have some doubts of the real dignity
of such a proceeding, but at all events the merit of the form of the flying buttress depends
on its faithfully and visibly performing this somewhat humble office; it is, therefore, in
its purity, a mere sloping bar of stone, with an arch beneath it to carry its weight, that
is to say, to prevent the action of gravity from in any wise deflecting it, or causing it to
break downwards under the lateral thrust; it is thus formed quite simple in Notre Dame of Paris,
and in the Cathedral of Beauvais, while at Cologne the sloping bars are pierced with quatrefoils,
and at Amiens with traceried arches. Both seem to me effeminate and false in principle; not,
of course, that there is any occasion to make the flying buttress heavy, if a light one will
answer the purpose; but it seems as if some security were sacrificed to ornament. At Amiens
the arrangement is now seen to great disadvantage, for the early traceries have been replaced
by base flamboyant ones, utterly weak and despicable. Of the degradations of the original form
which took place in after times, I have spoken at p. 35 of the "Seven Lamps."

§ XI. The form of the common buttress must be familiar to the eye of every reader, sloping
if low, and thrown into successive steps if they are to be carried to any considerable height.
There is much dignity in them when they are of essential service; but even in their best examples,
their awkward angles are among the least manageable features of the Northern Gothic, and the
whole organisation of its system was destroyed by their unnecessary and lavish application
on a diminished scale; until the buttress became actually confused with the shaft, and we find
strangely crystallised masses of diminutive buttress applied, for merely vertical support,
in the northern tabernacle work; while in some recent copies of it the principle has been so
far distorted that the tiny buttressings look as if they carried the superstructure on the
points of their pinnacles, as in the Cranmer memorial at Oxford. Indeed, in most modern Gothic,
the architects evidently consider buttresses as convenient breaks of blank surface, and general
apologies for deadness of wall. They stand in the place of ideas, and I think are supposed
also to have something of the odor of sanctity about them; otherwise, one hardly sees why a
warehouse seventy feet high should have nothing of the kind, and a chapel, which one can just
get into with one's hat off, should have a bunch of them at every corner; and worse than this,
they are even thought ornamental when they can be of no possible use; and these stupid penthouse
outlines are forced upon the eye in every species of decoration: in St. Margaret's Chapel,
West Street, there are actually a couple of buttresses at the end of every pew.

§ XII. It is almost impossible, in consequence of these unwise repetitions of it, to contemplate
the buttress without some degree of prejudice; and I look upon it as one of the most justifiable
causes of the unfortunate aversion with which many of our best architects regard the whole
Gothic school. It may, however, always be regarded with respect when its form is simple and
its service clear; but no treason to Gothic can be greater than the use of it in indolence
or vanity, to enhance the intricacies of structure, or occupy the vacuities of design.

CHAPTER XVI.

  FORM OF APERTURE.

§ I. We have now, in order, examined the means of raising walls and sustaining roofs, and we
have finally to consider the structure of the necessary apertures in the wall veil, the door
and window; respecting which there are three main points to be considered.

1. The form of the aperture, i.e., its outline, its size, and the forms of its sides.

2. The filling of the aperture, i.e., valves and glass, and their holdings.

3. The protection of the aperture, and its appliances, i.e., canopies, porches, and balconies.
We shall examine these in succession.

§ II. 1. The form of the aperture: and first of doors. We will, for the present, leave out
of the question doors and gates in unroofed walls, the forms of these being very arbitrary,
and confine ourselves to the consideration of doors of entrance into roofed buildings. Such
doors will, for the most part, be at, or near, the base of the building; except when raised
for purposes of defence, as in the old Scotch border towers, and our own Martello towers, or,
as in Switzerland, to permit access in deep snow, or when stairs are carried up outside the
house for convenience or magnificence. But in most cases, whether high or low, a door may be
assumed to be considerably lower than the apartments or buildings into which it gives admission,
and therefore to have some height of wall above it, whose weight must be carried by the heading
of the door. It is clear, therefore, that the best heading must be an arch, because the strongest,
and that a square-headed door must be wrong, unless under Mont-Cenisian masonry; or else, unless
the top of the door be the roof of the building, as in low cottages. And a square-headed door
is just so much more wrong and ugly than a connexion of main shafts by lintels, as the weight
of wall above the door is likely to be greater than that above the main shafts. Thus, while
I admit the Greek general forms of temple to be admirable in their kind, I think the Greek
door always offensive and unmanageable.

§ III. We have it also determined by necessity, that the apertures shall be at least above
a man's height, with perpendicular sides (for sloping sides are evidently unnecessary, and
even inconvenient, therefore absurd) and level threshold; and this aperture we at present suppose
simply cut through the wall without any bevelling of the jambs. Such a door, wide enough for
two persons to pass each other easily, and with such fillings or valves as we may hereafter
find expedient, may be fit enough for any building into which entrance is required neither
often, nor by many persons at a time. But when entrance and egress are constant, or required
by crowds, certain further modifications must take place.

§ IV. When entrance and egress are constant, it may be supposed that the valves will be absent
or unfastened,--that people will be passing more quickly than when the entrance and egress
are unfrequent, and that the square angles of the wall will be inconvenient to such quick passers
through. It is evident, therefore, that what would be done in time, for themselves, by the
passing multitude, should be done for them at once by the architect; and that these angles,
which would be worn away by friction, should at once be bevelled off, or, as it is called,
splayed, and the most contracted part of the aperture made as short as possible, so that the
plan of the entrance should become as at a, Fig. XLIII.

§ V. Farther. As persons on the outside may often approach the door or depart from it, beside
the building, so as to turn aside as they enter or leave the door, and therefore touch its
jamb, but, on the inside, will in almost every case approach the door, or depart from it in
the direct line of the entrance (people generally walking forward when they enter a hall, court,
or chamber of any kind, and being forced to do so when they enter a passage), it is evident
that the bevelling may be very slight on the inside, but should be large on the outside, so
that the plan of the aperture should become as at b, Fig. XLIII. Farther, as the bevelled wall
cannot conveniently carry an unbevelled arch, the door arch must be bevelled also, and the
aperture, seen from the outside, will have somewhat the aspect of a small cavern diminishing
towards the interior.

§ VI. If, however, beside frequent entrance, entrance is required for multitudes at the same
time, the size of the aperture either must be increased, or other apertures must be introduced.
It may, in some buildings, be optional with the architect whether he shall give many small
doors, or few large ones; and in some, as theatres, amphitheatres, and other places where the
crowd are apt to be impatient, many doors are by far the best arrangement of the two. Often,
however, the purposes of the building, as when it is to be entered by processions, or where
the crowd most usually enter in one direction, require the large single entrance; and (for
here again the æsthetic and structural laws cannot be separated) the expression and harmony
of the building require, in nearly every case, an entrance of largeness proportioned to the
multitude which is to meet within. Nothing is more unseemly than that a great multitude should
find its way out and in, as ants and wasps do, through holes; and nothing more undignified
than the paltry doors of many of our English cathedrals, which look as if they were made, not
for the open egress, but for the surreptitious drainage of a stagnant congregation. Besides,
the expression of the church door should lead us, as far as possible, to desire at least the
western entrance to be single, partly because no man of right feeling would willingly lose
the idea of unity and fellowship in going up to worship, which is suggested by the vast single
entrance; partly because it is at the entrance that the most serious words of the building
are always addressed, by its sculptures or inscriptions, to the worshipper; and it is well,
that these words should be spoken to all at once, as by one great voice, not broken up into
weak repetitions over minor doors.

In practice the matter has been, I suppose, regulated almost altogether by convenience, the
western doors being single in small churches, while in the larger the entrances become three
or five, the central door remaining always principal, in consequence of the fine sense of composition
which the mediæval builders never lost. These arrangements have formed the noblest buildings
in the world. Yet it is worth observing[55] how perfect in its simplicity the single entrance
may become, when it is treated as in the Duomo and St. Zeno of Verona, and other such early
Lombard churches, having noble porches, and rich sculptures grouped around the entrance.

§ VII. However, whether the entrances be single, triple, or manifold, it is a constant law
that one shall be principal, and all shall be of size in some degree proportioned to that of
the building. And this size is, of course, chiefly to be expressed in width, that being the
only useful dimension in a door (except for pageantry, chairing of bishops and waving of banners,
and other such vanities, not, I hope, after this century, much to be regarded in the building
of Christian temples); but though the width is the only necessary dimension, it is well to
increase the height also in some proportion to it, in order that there may be less weight of
wall above, resting on the increased span of the arch. This is, however, so much the necessary
result of the broad curve of the arch itself, that there is no structural necessity of elevating
the jamb; and I believe that beautiful entrances might be made of every span of arch, retaining
the jamb at a little more than a man's height, until the sweep of the curves became so vast
that the small vertical line became a part of them, and one entered into the temple as under
a great rainbow.

§ VIII. On the other hand, the jamb may be elevated indefinitely, so that the increasing entrance
retains at least the proportion of width it had originally; say 4 ft. by 7 ft. 5 in. But a
less proportion of width than this has always a meagre, inhospitable, and ungainly look except
in military architecture, where the narrowness of the entrance is necessary, and its height
adds to its grandeur, as between the entrance towers of our British castles. This law however,
observe, applies only to true doors, not to the arches of porches, which may be of any proportion,
as of any number, being in fact intercolumniations, not doors; as in the noble example of the
west front of Peterborough, which, in spite of the destructive absurdity of its central arch
being the narrowest, would still, if the paltry porter's lodge, or gatehouse, or turnpike,
or whatever it is, were knocked out of the middle of it, be the noblest west front in England.

§ IX. Further, and finally. In proportion to the height and size of the building, and therefore
to the size of its doors, will be the thickness of its walls, especially at the foundation,
that is to say, beside the doors; and also in proportion to the numbers of a crowd will be
the unruliness and pressure of it. Hence, partly in necessity and partly in prudence, the splaying
or chamfering of the jamb of the larger door will be deepened, and, if possible, made at a
larger angle for the large door than for the small one; so that the large door will always
be encompassed by a visible breadth of jamb proportioned to its own magnitude. The decorative
value of this feature we shall see hereafter.

§ X. The second kind of apertures we have to examine are those of windows.

Window apertures are mainly of two kinds; those for outlook, and those for inlet of light,
many being for both purposes, and either purpose, or both, combined in military architecture
with those of offence and defence. But all window apertures, as compared with door apertures,
have almost infinite licence of form and size: they may be of any shape, from the slit or cross
slit to the circle;[56] of any size, from the loophole of the castle to the pillars of light
of the cathedral apse. Yet, according to their place and purpose, one or two laws of fitness
hold respecting them, which let us examine in the two classes of windows successively, but
without reference to military architecture, which here, as before, we may dismiss as a subject
of separate science, only noticing that windows, like all other features, are always delightful,
if not beautiful, when their position and shape have indeed been thus necessarily determined,
and that many of their most picturesque forms have resulted from the requirements of war. We
should also find in military architecture the typical forms of the two classes of outlet and
inlet windows in their utmost development; the greatest sweep of sight and range of shot on
the one hand, and the fullest entry of light and air on the other, being constantly required
at the smallest possible apertures. Our business, however, is to reason out the laws for ourselves,
not to take the examples as we find them.

§ XI. 1. Outlook apertures. For these no general outline is determinable by the necessities
or inconveniences of outlooking, except only that the bottom or sill of the windows, at whatever
height, should be horizontal, for the convenience of leaning on it, or standing on it if the
window be to the ground. The form of the upper part of the window is quite immaterial, for
all windows allow a greater range of sight when they are approached than that of the eye itself:
it is the approachability of the window, that is to say, the annihilation of the thickness
of the wall, which is the real point to be attended to. If, therefore, the aperture be inaccessible,
or so small that the thickness of the wall cannot be entered, the wall is to be bevelled[57]
on the outside, so as to increase the range of sight as far as possible; if the aperture can
be entered, then bevelled from the point to which entrance is possible. The bevelling will,
if possible, be in every direction, that is to say, upwards at the top, outwards at the sides,
and downwards at the bottom, but essentially downwards; the earth and the doings upon it being
the chief object in outlook windows, except of observatories; and where the object is a distinct
and special view downwards, it will be of advantage to shelter the eye as far as possible from
the rays of light coming from above, and the head of the window may be left horizontal, or
even the whole aperture sloped outwards, as the slit in a letter-box is inwards.

The best windows for outlook are, of course, oriels and bow windows, but these are not to be
considered under the head of apertures merely; they are either balconies roofed and glazed,
and to be considered under the head of external appliances, or they are each a story of an
external semi-tower, having true aperture windows on each side of it.

§ XII. 2. Inlet windows. These windows may, of course, be of any shape and size whatever, according
to the other necessities of the building, and the quantity and direction of light desired,
their purpose being now to throw it in streams on particular lines or spots; now to diffuse
it everywhere; sometimes to introduce it in broad masses, tempered in strength, as in the cathedral
colored window; sometimes in starry showers of scattered brilliancy, like the apertures in
the roof of an Arabian bath; perhaps the most beautiful of all forms being the rose, which
has in it the unity of both characters, and sympathy with that of the source of light itself.
It is noticeable, however, that while both the circle and pointed oval are beautiful window
forms, it would be very painful to cut either of them in half and connect them by vertical
lines, as in Fig. XLIV. The reason is, I believe, that so treated, the upper arch is not considered
as connected with the lower, and forming an entire figure, but as the ordinary arch roof of
the aperture, and the lower arch as an arch floor, equally unnecessary and unnatural. Also,
the elliptical oval is generally an unsatisfactory form, because it gives the idea of useless
trouble in building it, though it occurs quaintly and pleasantly in the former windows of France:
I believe it is also objectionable because it has an indeterminate, slippery look, like that
of a bubble rising through a fluid. It, and all elongated forms, are still more objectionable
placed horizontally, because this is the weakest position they can structurally have; that
is to say, less light is admitted, with greater loss of strength to the building, than by any
other form. If admissible anywhere, it is for the sake of variety at the top of the building,
as the flat parallelogram sometimes not ungracefully in Italian Renaissance.

§ XIII. The question of bevelling becomes a little more complicated in the inlet than the outlook
window, because the mass or quantity of light admitted is often of more consequence than its
direction, and often vice versâ; and the outlook window is supposed to be approachable, which
is far from being always the case with windows for light, so that the bevelling which in the
outlook window is chiefly to open range of sight, is in the inlet a means not only of admitting
the light in greater quantity, but of directing it to the spot on which it is to fall. But,
in general, the bevelling of the one window will reverse that of the other; for, first, no
natural light will strike on the inlet window from beneath, unless reflected light, which is
(I believe) injurious to the health and the sight; and thus, while in the outlook window the
outside bevel downwards is essential, in the inlet it would be useless: and the sill is to
be flat, if the window be on a level with the spot it is to light; and sloped downwards within,
if above it. Again, as the brightest rays of light are the steepest, the outside bevel upwards
is as essential in the roof of the inlet as it was of small importance in that of the outlook
window.

§ XIV. On the horizontal section the aperture will expand internally, a somewhat larger number
of rays being thus reflected from the jambs; and the aperture being thus the smallest possible
outside, this is the favorite military form of inlet window, always found in magnificent development
in the thick walls of mediæval castles and convents. Its effect is tranquil, but cheerless
and dungeon-like in its fullest development, owing to the limitation of the range of sight
in the outlook, which, if the window be unapproachable, reduces it to a mere point of light.
A modified condition of it, with some combination of the outlook form, is probably the best
for domestic buildings in general (which, however, in modern architecture, are unhappily so
thin walled, that the outline of the jambs becomes a matter almost of indifference), it being
generally noticeable that the depth of recess which I have observed to be essential to nobility
of external effect has also a certain dignity of expression, as appearing to be intended rather
to admit light to persons quietly occupied in their homes, than to stimulate or favor the curiosity
of idleness.

FOOTNOTES:

  [55] And worth questioning, also, whether the triple porch has not
    been associated with Romanist views of mediatorship; the Redeemer
    being represented as presiding over the central door only, and the
    lateral entrances being under the protection of saints, while the
    Madonna almost always has one or both of the transepts. But it would
    be wrong to press this, for, in nine cases out of ten, the architect
    has been merely influenced in his placing of the statues by an
    artist's desire of variety in their forms and dress; and very
    naturally prefers putting a canonisation over one door, a martyrdom
    over another, and an assumption over a third, to repeating a
    crucifixion or a judgment above all. The architect's doctrine is
    only, therefore, to be noted with indisputable reprobation when the
    Madonna gets possession of the main door.

  [56] The arch heading is indeed the best where there is much
    incumbent weight, but a window frequently has very little weight
    above it, especially when placed high, and the arched form loses
    light in a low room: therefore the square-headed window is
    admissible where the square-headed door is not.

  [57] I do not like the sound of the word "splayed;" I always shall
    use "bevelled" instead.

CHAPTER XVII.

  FILLING OF APERTURE.

§ I. Thus far we have been concerned with the outline only of the aperture: we were next, it
will be remembered, to consider the necessary modes of filling it with valves in the case of
the door, or with glass or tracery in that of the window.

1. Fillings of doors. We concluded, in the previous Chapter, that doors in buildings of any
importance or size should have headings in the form of an arch. This is, however, the most
inconvenient form we could choose, as respects the fitting of the valves of the doorway; for
the arch-shaped head of the valves not only requires considerable nicety in fitting to the
arch, but adds largely to the weight of the door,--a double disadvantage, straining the hinges
and making it cumbersome in opening. And this inconvenience is so much perceived by the eye,
that a door valve with a pointed head is always a disagreeable object. It becomes, therefore,
a matter of true necessity so to arrange the doorway as to admit of its being fitted with rectangular
valves.

§ II. Now, in determining the form of the aperture, we supposed the jamb of the door to be
of the utmost height required for entrance. The extra height of the arch is unnecessary as
an opening, the arch being required for its strength only, not for its elevation. There is,
therefore, no reason why it should not be barred across by a horizontal lintel, into which
the valves may be fitted, and the triangular or semicircular arched space above the lintel
may then be permanently closed, as we choose, either with bars, or glass, or stone.

This is the form of all good doors, without exception, over the whole world and in all ages,
and no other can ever be invented.

§ III. In the simplest doors the cross lintel is of wood only, and glass or bars occupy the
space above, a very frequent form in Venice. In more elaborate doors the cross lintel is of
stone, and the filling sometimes of brick, sometimes of stone, very often a grand single stone
being used to close the entire space: the space thus filled is called the Tympanum. In large
doors the cross lintel is too long to bear the great incumbent weight of this stone filling
without support; it is, therefore, carried by a pier in the centre; and two valves are used,
fitted to the rectangular spaces on each side of the pier. In the most elaborate examples of
this condition, each of these secondary doorways has an arch heading, a cross lintel, and a
triangular filling or tympanum of its own, all subordinated to the main arch above.

§ IV. 2. Fillings of windows.

When windows are large, and to be filled with glass, the sheet of glass, however constructed,
whether of large panes or small fragments, requires the support of bars of some kind, either
of wood, metal, or stone. Wood is inapplicable on a large scale, owing to its destructibility;
very fit for door-valves, which can be easily refitted, and in which weight would be an inconvenience,
but very unfit for window-bars, which, if they decayed, might let the whole window be blown
in before their decay was observed, and in which weight would be an advantage, as offering
more resistance to the wind.

Iron is, however, fit for window-bars, and there seems no constructive reason why we should
not have iron traceries, as well as iron pillars, iron churches, and iron steeples. But I have,
in the "Seven Lamps," given reasons for not considering such structures as architecture at all.

The window-bars must, therefore, be of stone, and of stone only.

§ V. The purpose of the window being always to let in as much light, and command as much view,
as possible, these bars of stone are to be made as slender and as few as they can be, consistently
with their due strength.

Let it be required to support the breadth of glass, a, b, Fig. XLV. The tendency of the glass
sustaining any force, as of wind from without, is to bend into an arch inwards, in the dotted
line, and break in the centre. It is to be supported, therefore, by the bar put in its centre, c.

But this central bar, c, may not be enough, and the spaces a c, c b, may still need support.
The next step will be to put two bars instead of one, and divide the window into three spaces
as at d.

But this may still not be enough, and the window may need three bars. Now the greatest stress
is always on the centre of the window. If the three bars are equal in strength, as at e, the
central bar is either too slight for its work, or the lateral bars too thick for theirs. Therefore,
we must slightly increase the thickness of the central bar, and diminish that of the lateral
ones, so as to obtain the arrangement at f h. If the window enlarge farther, each of the spaces
f g, g h, is treated as the original space a b, and we have the groups of bars k and l.

So that, whatever the shape of the window, whatever the direction and number of the bars, there
are to be central or main bars; second bars subordinated to them; third bars subordinated to
the second, and so on to the number required. This is called the subordination of tracery,
a system delightful to the eye and mind, owing to its anatomical framing and unity, and to
its expression of the laws of good government in all fragile and unstable things. All tracery,
therefore, which is not subordinated, is barbarous, in so far as this part of its structure
is concerned.

§ VI. The next question will be the direction of the bars. The reader will understand at once,
without any laborious proof, that a given area of glass, supported by its edges, is stronger
in its resistance to violence when it is arranged in a long strip or band than in a square;
and that, therefore, glass is generally to be arranged, especially in windows on a large scale,
in oblong areas: and if the bars so dividing it be placed horizontally, they will have less
power of supporting themselves, and will need to be thicker in consequence, than if placed
vertically. As far, therefore, as the form of the window permits, they are to be vertical.

§ VII. But even when so placed, they cannot be trusted to support themselves beyond a certain
height, but will need cross bars to steady them. Cross bars of stone are, therefore, to be
introduced at necessary intervals, not to divide the glass, but to support the upright stone
bars. The glass is always to be divided longitudinally as far as possible, and the upright
bars which divide it supported at proper intervals. However high the window, it is almost impossible
that it should require more than two cross bars.

§ VIII. It may sometimes happen that when tall windows are placed very close to each other
for the sake of more light, the masonry between them may stand in need, or at least be the
better of, some additional support. The cross bars of the windows may then be thickened, in
order to bond the intermediate piers more strongly together, and if this thickness appear ungainly,
it may be modified by decoration.

§ IX. We have thus arrived at the idea of a vertical frame work of subordinated bars, supported
by cross bars at the necessary intervals, and the only remaining question is the method of
insertion into the aperture. Whatever its form, if we merely let the ends of the bars into
the voussoirs of its heading, the least settlement of the masonry would distort the arch, or
push up some of its voussoirs, or break the window bars, or push them aside. Evidently our
object should be to connect the window bars among themselves, so framing them together that
they may give the utmost possible degree of support to the whole window head in case of any
settlement. But we know how to do this already: our window bars are nothing but small shafts.
Capital them; throw small arches across between the smaller bars, large arches over them between
the larger bars, one comprehensive arch over the whole, or else a horizontal lintel, if the
window have a flat head; and we have a complete system of mutual support, independent of the
aperture head, and yet assisting to sustain it, if need be. But we want the spandrils of this
arch system to be themselves as light, and to let as much light through them, as possible:
and we know already how to pierce them (Chap. XII. § VII.). We pierce them with circles; and
we have, if the circles are small and the stonework strong, the traceries of Giotto and the
Pisan school; if the circles are as large as possible and the bars slender, those which I have
already figured and described as the only perfect traceries of the Northern Gothic.[58] The
varieties of their design arise partly from the different size of window and consequent number
of bars; partly from the different heights of their pointed arches, as well as the various
positions of the window head in relation to the roof, rendering one or another arrangement
better for dividing the light, and partly from æsthetic and expressional requirements, which,
within certain limits, may be allowed a very important influence: for the strength of the bars
is ordinarily so much greater than is absolutely necessary, that some portion of it may be
gracefully sacrificed to the attainment of variety in the plans of tracery--a variety which,
even within its severest limits, is perfectly endless; more especially in the pointed arch,
the proportion of the tracery being in the round arch necessarily more fixed.

§ X. The circular window furnishes an exception to the common law, that the bars shall be vertical
through the greater part of their length: for if they were so, they could neither have secure
perpendicular footing, nor secure heading, their thrust being perpendicular to the curve of
the voussoirs only in the centre of the window; therefore, a small circle, like the axle of
a wheel, is put into the centre of the window, large enough to give footing to the necessary
number of radiating bars; and the bars are arranged as spokes, being all of course properly
capitaled and arch-headed. This is the best form of tracery for circular windows, naturally
enough called wheel windows when so filled.

§ XI. Now, I wish the reader especially to observe that we have arrived at these forms of perfect
Gothic tracery without the smallest reference to any practice of any school, or to any law
of authority whatever. They are forms having essentially nothing whatever to do either with
Goths or Greeks. They are eternal forms, based on laws of gravity and cohesion; and no better,
nor any others so good, will ever be invented, so long as the present laws of gravity and cohesion
subsist.

§ XII. It does not at all follow that this group of forms owes its origin to any such course
of reasoning as that which has now led us to it. On the contrary, there is not the smallest
doubt that tracery began, partly, in the grouping of windows together (subsequently enclosed
within a large arch[59]), and partly in the fantastic penetrations of a single slab of stones
under the arch, as the circle in Plate V. above. The perfect form seems to have been accidentally
struck in passing from experiment on the one side, to affectation on the other; and it was
so far from ever becoming systematised, that I am aware of no type of tracery for which a less
decided preference is shown in the buildings in which it exists. The early pierced traceries
are multitudinous and perfect in their kind,--the late Flamboyant, luxuriant in detail, and
lavish in quantity,--but the perfect forms exist in comparatively few churches, generally in
portions of the church only, and are always connected, and that closely, either with the massy
forms out of which they have emerged, or with the enervated types into which they are instantly
to degenerate.

§ XIII. Nor indeed are we to look upon them as in all points superior to the more ancient examples.
We have above conducted our reasoning entirely on the supposition that a single aperture is
given, which it is the object to fill with glass, diminishing the power of the light as little
as possible. But there are many cases, as in triforium and cloister lights, in which glazing
is not required; in which, therefore, the bars, if there be any, must have some more important
function than that of merely holding glass, and in which their actual use is to give steadiness
and tone, as it were, to the arches and walls above and beside them; or to give the idea of
protection to those who pass along the triforium, and of seclusion to those who walk in the
cloister. Much thicker shafts, and more massy arches, may be properly employed in work of this
kind; and many groups of such tracery will be found resolvable into true colonnades, with the
arches in pairs, or in triple or quadruple groups, and with small rosettes pierced above them
for light. All this is just as right in its place, as the glass tracery is in its own function,
and often much more grand. But the same indulgence is not to be shown to the affectations which
succeeded the developed forms. Of these there are three principal conditions: the Flamboyant
of France, the Stump tracery of Germany, and the Perpendicular of England.

§ XIV. Of these the first arose, by the most delicate and natural transitions, out of the perfect
school. It was an endeavor to introduce more grace into its lines, and more change into its
combinations; and the æsthetic results are so beautiful, that for some time after the right
road had been left, the aberration was more to be admired than regretted. The final conditions
became fantastic and effeminate, but, in the country where they had been invented, never lost
their peculiar grace until they were replaced by the Renaissance. The copies of the school
in England and Italy have all its faults and none of its beauties; in France, whatever it lost
in method or in majesty, it gained in fantasy: literally Flamboyant, it breathed away its strength
into the air; but there is not more difference between the commonest doggrel that ever broke
prose into unintelligibility, and the burning mystery of Coleridge, or spirituality of Elizabeth
Barrett, than there is between the dissolute dulness of English Flamboyant, and the flaming
undulations of the wreathed lines of delicate stone, that confuse themselves with the clouds
of every morning sky that brightens above the valley of the Seine.

§ XV. The second group of traceries, the intersectional or German group, may be considered
as including the entire range of the absurd forms which were invented in order to display dexterity
in stone-cutting and ingenuity in construction. They express the peculiar character of the
German mind, which cuts the frame of every truth joint from joint, in order to prove the edge
of its instruments; and, in all cases, prefers a new or a strange thought to a good one, and
a subtle thought to a useful one. The point and value of the German tracery consists principally
in turning the features of good traceries upside down, and cutting them in two where they are
properly continuous. To destroy at once foundation and membership, and suspend everything in
the air, keeping out of sight, as far as possible, the evidences of a beginning and the probabilities
of an end, are the main objects of German architecture, as of modern German divinity.

§ XVI. This school has, however, at least the merit of ingenuity. Not so the English Perpendicular,
though a very curious school also in its way. In the course of the reasoning which led us to
the determination of the perfect Gothic tracery, we were induced successively to reject certain
methods of arrangement as weak, dangerous, or disagreeable. Collect all these together, and
practise them at once, and you have the English Perpendicular.

As thus. You find, in the first place (§ V.), that your tracery bars are to be subordinated,
less to greater; so you take a group of, suppose, eight, which you make all exactly equal,
giving you nine equal spaces in the window, as at A, Fig. XLVI. You found, in the second place
(§ VII.), that there was no occasion for more than two cross bars; so you take at least four
or five (also represented at A, Fig. XLVI.), also carefully equalised, and set at equal spaces.
You found, in the third place (§ VIII.), that these bars were to be strengthened, in order
to support the main piers; you will therefore cut the ends off the uppermost, and the fourth
into three pieces (as also at A). In the fourth place, you found (§ IX.) that you were never
to run a vertical bar into the arch head; so you run them all into it (as at B, Fig. XLVI.);
and this last arrangement will be useful in two ways, for it will not only expose both the
bars and the archivolt to an apparent probability of every species of dislocation at any moment,
but it will provide you with two pleasing interstices at the flanks, in the shape of carving-knives,
a, b, which, by throwing across the curves c, d, you may easily multiply into four; and these,
as you can put nothing into their sharp tops, will afford you a more than usually rational
excuse for a little bit of Germanism, in filling them with arches upside down, e, f. You will
now have left at your disposal two and forty similar interstices, which, for the sake of variety,
you will proceed to fill with two and forty similar arches: and, as you were told that the
moment a bar received an arch heading, it was to be treated as a shaft and capitalled, you
will take care to give your bars no capitals nor bases, but to run bars, foliations and all,
well into each other after the fashion of cast-iron, as at C. You have still two triangular
spaces occurring in an important part of your window, g g, which, as they are very conspicuous,
and you cannot make them uglier than they are, you will do wisely to let alone;--and you will
now have the west window of the cathedral of Winchester, a very perfect example of English
Perpendicular. Nor do I think that you can, on the whole, better the arrangement, unless, perhaps,
by adding buttresses to some of the bars, as is done in the cathedral at Gloucester; these
buttresses having the double advantage of darkening the window when seen from within, and suggesting,
when it is seen from without, the idea of its being divided by two stout party walls, with
a heavy thrust against the glass.

§ XVII. Thus far we have considered the plan of the tracery only: we have lastly to note the
conditions under which the glass is to be attached to the bars; and the sections of the bars
themselves.

These bars we have seen, in the perfect form, are to become shafts; but, supposing the object
to be the admission of as much light as possible, it is clear that the thickness of the bar
ought to be chiefly in the depth of the window, and that by increasing the depth of the bar
we may diminish its breadth: clearly, therefore, we should employ the double group of shafts,
b, of Fig. XIV., setting it edgeways in the window: but as the glass would then come between
the two shafts, we must add a member into which it is to be fitted, as at a, Fig. XLVII., and
uniting these three members together in the simplest way, with a curved instead of a sharp
recess behind the shafts, we have the section b, the perfect, but simplest type of the main
tracery bars in good Gothic. In triforium and cloister tracery, which has no glass to hold,
the central member is omitted, and we have either the pure double shaft, always the most graceful,
or a single and more massy shaft, which is the simpler and more usual form.

§ XVIII. Finally: there is an intermediate arrangement between the glazed and the open tracery,
that of the domestic traceries of Venice. Peculiar conditions, hereafter to be described, require
the shafts of these traceries to become the main vertical supports of the floors and walls.
Their thickness is therefore enormous; and yet free egress is required between them (into balconies)
which is obtained by doors in their lattice glazing. To prevent the inconvenience and ugliness
of driving the hinges and fastenings of them into the shafts, and having the play of the doors
in the intervals, the entire glazing is thrown behind the pillars, and attached to their abaci
and bases with iron. It is thus securely sustained by their massy bulk, and leaves their symmetry
and shade undisturbed.

§ XIX. The depth at which the glass should be placed, in windows without traceries, will generally
be fixed by the forms of their bevelling, the glass occupying the narrowest interval; but when
its position is not thus fixed, as in many London houses, it is to be remembered that the deeper
the glass is set (the wall being of given thickness), the more light will enter, and the clearer
the prospect will be to a person sitting quietly in the centre of the room; on the contrary,
the farther out the glass is set, the more convenient the window will be for a person rising
and looking out of it. The one, therefore, is an arrangement for the idle and curious, who
care only about what is going on upon the earth: the other for those who are willing to remain
at rest, so that they have free admission of the light of Heaven. This might be noted as a
curious expressional reason for the necessity (of which no man of ordinary feeling would doubt
for a moment) of a deep recess in the window, on the outside, to all good or architectural
effect: still, as there is no reason why people should be made idle by having it in their power
to look out of window, and as the slight increase of light or clearness of view in the centre
of a room is more than balanced by the loss of space, and the greater chill of the nearer glass
and outside air, we can, I fear, allege no other structural reason for the picturesque external
recess, than the expediency of a certain degree of protection, for the glass, from the brightest
glare of sunshine, and heaviest rush of rain.

FOOTNOTES:

  [58] "Seven Lamps," p. 53.

  [59] On the north side of the nave of the cathedral of Lyons, there
    is an early French window, presenting one of the usual groups of
    foliated arches and circles, left, as it were, loose, without any
    enclosing curve. The effect is very painful. This remarkable window
    is associated with others of the common form.

CHAPTER XVIII.

  PROTECTION OF APERTURE.

§ I. We have hitherto considered the aperture as merely pierced in the thickness of the walls;
and when its masonry is simple and the fillings of the aperture are unimportant, it may well
remain so. But when the fillings are delicate and of value, as in the case of colored glass,
finely wrought tracery, or sculpture, such as we shall often find occupying the tympanum of
doorways, some protection becomes necessary against the run of the rain down the walls, and
back by the bevel of the aperture to the joints or surface of the fillings.

§ II. The first and simplest mode of obtaining this is by channelling the jambs and arch head;
and this is the chief practical service of aperture mouldings, which are otherwise entirely
decorative. But as this very decorative character renders them unfit to be made channels for
rain water, it is well to add some external roofing to the aperture, which may protect it from
the run of all the rain, except that which necessarily beats into its own area. This protection,
in its most usual form, is a mere dripstone moulding carried over or round the head of the
aperture. But this is, in reality, only a contracted form of a true roof, projecting from the
wall over the aperture; and all protections of apertures whatsoever are to be conceived as
portions of small roofs, attached to the wall behind; and supported by it, so long as their
scale admits of their being so with safety, and afterwards in such manner as may be most expedient.
The proper forms of these, and modes of their support, are to be the subject of our final enquiry.

§ III. Respecting their proper form we need not stay long in doubt. A deep gable is evidently
the best for throwing off rain; even a low gable being better than a high arch. Flat roofs,
therefore, may only be used when the nature of the building renders the gable unsightly; as
when there is not room for it between the stories; or when the object is rather shade than
protection from rain, as often in verandahs and balconies. But for general service the gable
is the proper and natural form, and may be taken as representative of the rest. Then this gable
may either project unsupported from the wall, a, Fig. XLVIII., or be carried by brackets or
spurs, b, or by walls or shafts, c, which shafts or walls may themselves be, in windows, carried
on a sill; and this, in its turn, supported by brackets or spurs. We shall glance at the applications
of each of these forms in order.

§ IV. There is not much variety in the case of the first, a, Fig. XLVIII. In the Cumberland
and border cottages the door is generally protected by two pieces of slate arranged in a gable,
giving the purest possible type of the first form. In elaborate architecture such a projection
hardly ever occurs, and in large architecture cannot with safety occur, without brackets; but
by cutting away the greater part of the projection, we shall arrive at the idea of a plain
gabled cornice, of which a perfect example will be found in Plate VII. of the folio series.
With this first complete form we may associate the rude, single, projecting, penthouse roof;
imperfect, because either it must be level and the water lodge lazily upon it, or throw off
the drip upon the persons entering.

§ V. 2. b, Fig. XLVIII. This is a most beautiful and natural type, and is found in all good
architecture, from the highest to the most humble: it is a frequent form of cottage door, more
especially when carried on spurs, being of peculiarly easy construction in wood: as applied
to large architecture, it can evidently be built, in its boldest and simplest form, either
of wood only, or on a scale which will admit of its sides being each a single slab of stone.
If so large as to require jointed masonry, the gabled sides will evidently require support,
and an arch must be thrown across under them, as in Fig. XLIX., from Fiesole.

If we cut the projection gradually down, we arrive at the common Gothic gable dripstone carried
on small brackets, carved into bosses, heads, or some other ornamental form; the sub-arch in
such case being useless, is removed or coincides with the arch head of the aperture.

§ VI. 3. c, Fig. XLVIII. Substituting walls or pillars for the brackets, we may carry the projection
as far out as we choose, and form the perfect porch, either of the cottage or village church,
or of the cathedral. As we enlarge the structure, however, certain modifications of form become
necessary, owing to the increased boldness of the required supporting arch. For, as the lower
end of the gabled roof and of the arch cannot coincide, we have necessarily above the shafts
one of the two forms a or b, in Fig. L., of which the latter is clearly the best, requiring
less masonry and shorter roofing; and when the arch becomes so large as to cause a heavy lateral
thrust, it may become necessary to provide for its farther safety by pinnacles, c.

This last is the perfect type of aperture protection. None other can ever be invented so good.
It is that once employed by Giotto in the cathedral of Florence, and torn down by the proveditore,
Benedetto Uguccione, to erect a Renaissance front instead; and another such has been destroyed,
not long since, in Venice, the porch of the church of St. Apollinare, also to put up some Renaissance
upholstery: for Renaissance, as if it were not nuisance enough in the mere fact of its own
existence, appears invariably as a beast of prey, and founds itself on the ruin of all that
is best and noblest. Many such porches, however, happily still exist in Italy, and are among
its principal glories.

§ VII. When porches of this kind, carried by walls, are placed close together, as in cases
where there are many and large entrances to a cathedral front, they would, in their general
form, leave deep and uncomfortable intervals, in which damp would lodge and grass grow; and
there would be a painful feeling in approaching the door in the midst of a crowd, as if some
of them might miss the real doors, and be driven into the intervals, and embayed there. Clearly
it will be a natural and right expedient, in such cases, to open the walls of the porch wider,
so that they may correspond in slope, or nearly so, with the bevel of the doorway, and either
meet each other in the intervals, or have the said intervals closed up with an intermediate
wall, so that nobody may get embayed in them. The porches will thus be united, and form one
range of great open gulphs or caverns, ready to receive all comers, and direct the current
of the crowd into the narrower entrances. As the lateral thrust of the arches is now met by
each other, the pinnacles, if there were any, must be removed, and waterspouts placed between
each arch to discharge the double drainage of the gables. This is the form of all the noble
northern porches, without exception, best represented by that of Rheims.

§ VIII. Contracted conditions of the pinnacle porch are beautifully used in the doors of the
cathedral of Florence; and the entire arrangement, in its most perfect form, as adapted to
window protection and decoration, is applied by Giotto with inconceivable exquisiteness in
the windows of the campanile; those of the cathedral itself being all of the same type. Various
singular and delightful conditions of it are applied in Italian domestic architecture (in the
Broletto of Monza very quaintly), being associated with balconies for speaking to the people,
and passing into pulpits. In the north we glaze the sides of such projections, and they become
bow-windows, the shape of roofing being then nearly immaterial and very fantastic, often a
conical cap. All these conditions of window protection, being for real service, are endlessly
delightful (and I believe the beauty of the balcony, protected by an open canopy supported
by light shafts, never yet to have been properly worked out). But the Renaissance architects
destroyed all of them, and introduced the magnificent and witty Roman invention of a model
of a Greek pediment, with its cornices of monstrous thickness, bracketed up above the window.
The horizontal cornice of the pediment is thus useless, and of course, therefore, retained;
the protection to the head of the window being constructed on the principle of a hat with its
crown sewn up. But the deep and dark triangular cavity thus obtained affords farther opportunity
for putting ornament out of sight, of which the Renaissance architects are not slow to avail
themselves.

A more rational condition is the complete pediment with a couple of shafts, or pilasters, carried
on a bracketed sill; and the windows of this kind, which have been well designed, are perhaps
the best things which the Renaissance schools have produced: those of Whitehall are, in their
way, exceedingly beautiful; and those of the Palazzo Ricardi at Florence, in their simplicity
and sublimity, are scarcely unworthy of their reputed designer, Michael Angelo.

CHAPTER XIX.

  SUPERIMPOSITION.

§ I. The reader has now some knowledge of every feature of all possible architecture. Whatever
the nature of the building which may be submitted to his criticism, if it be an edifice at
all, if it be anything else than a mere heap of stones like a pyramid or breakwater, or than
a large stone hewn into shape, like an obelisk, it will be instantly and easily resolvable
into some of the parts which we have been hitherto considering: its pinnacles will separate
themselves into their small shafts and roofs; its supporting members into shafts and arches,
or walls penetrated by apertures of various shape, and supported by various kinds of buttresses.
Respecting each of these several features I am certain that the reader feels himself prepared,
by understanding their plain function, to form something like a reasonable and definite judgment,
whether they be good or bad; and this right judgment of parts will, in most cases, lead him
to just reverence or condemnation of the whole.

§ II. The various modes in which these parts are capable of combination, and the merits of
buildings of different form and expression, are evidently not reducible into lists, nor to
be estimated by general laws. The nobility of each building depends on its special fitness
for its own purposes; and these purposes vary with every climate, every soil, and every national
custom: nay, there were never, probably, two edifices erected in which some accidental difference
of condition did not require some difference of plan or of structure; so that, respecting plan
and distribution of parts, I do not hope to collect any universal law of right; but there are
a few points necessary to be noticed respecting the means by which height is attained in buildings
of various plans, and the expediency and methods of superimposition of one story or tier of
architecture above another.

§ III. For, in the preceding inquiry, I have always supposed either that a single shaft would
reach to the top of the building, or that the farther height required might be added in plain
wall above the heads of the arches; whereas it may often be rather expedient to complete the
entire lower series of arches, or finish the lower wall, with a bold string course or cornice,
and build another series of shafts, or another wall, on the top of it.

§ IV. This superimposition is seen in its simplest form in the interior shafts of a Greek temple;
and it has been largely used in nearly all countries where buildings have been meant for real
service. Outcry has often been raised against it, but the thing is so sternly necessary that
it has always forced itself into acceptance; and it would, therefore, be merely losing time
to refute the arguments of those who have attempted its disparagement. Thus far, however, they
have reason on their side, that if a building can be kept in one grand mass, without sacrificing
either its visible or real adaptation to its objects, it is not well to divide it into stories
until it has reached proportions too large to be justly measured by the eye. It ought then
to be divided in order to mark its bulk; and decorative divisions are often possible, which
rather increase than destroy the expression of general unity.

§ V. Superimposition, wisely practised, is of two kinds, directly contrary to each other, of
weight on lightness, and of lightness on weight; while the superimposition of weight on weight,
or lightness on lightness, is nearly always wrong.

1. Weight on lightness: I do not say weight on weakness. The superimposition of the human body
on its limbs I call weight on lightness: the superimposition of the branches on a tree trunk
I call lightness on weight: in both cases the support is fully adequate to the work, the form
of support being regulated by the differences of requirement. Nothing in architecture is half
so painful as the apparent want of sufficient support when the weight above is visibly passive:
for all buildings are not passive; some seem to rise by their own strength, or float by their
own buoyancy; a dome requires no visibility of support, one fancies it supported by the air.
But passive architecture without help for its passiveness is unendurable. In a lately built
house, No. 86, in Oxford Street, three huge stone pillars in the second story are carried apparently
by the edges of three sheets of plate glass in the first. I hardly know anything to match the
painfulness of this and some other of our shop structures, in which the iron-work is concealed;
nor, even when it is apparent, can the eye ever feel satisfied of their security, when built,
as at present, with fifty or sixty feet of wall above a rod of iron not the width of this page.

§ VI. The proper forms of this superimposition of weight on lightness have arisen, for the
most part, from the necessity or desirableness, in many situations, of elevating the inhabited
portions of buildings considerably above the ground level, especially those exposed to damp
or inundation, and the consequent abandonment of the ground story as unserviceable, or else
the surrender of it to public purposes. Thus, in many market and town houses, the ground story
is left open as a general place of sheltered resort, and the enclosed apartments raised on
pillars. In almost all warm countries the luxury, almost the necessity, of arcades to protect
the passengers from the sun, and the desirableness of large space in the rooms above, lead
to the same construction. Throughout the Venetian islet group, the houses seem to have been
thus, in the first instance, universally built, all the older palaces appearing to have had
the rez de chaussée perfectly open, the upper parts of the palace being sustained on magnificent
arches, and the smaller houses sustained in the same manner on wooden piers, still retained
in many of the cortiles, and exhibited characteristically throughout the main street of Murano.
As ground became more valuable and house-room more scarce, these ground-floors were enclosed
with wall veils between the original shafts, and so remain; but the type of the structure of
the entire city is given in the Ducal Palace.

§ VII. To this kind of superimposition we owe the most picturesque street effects throughout
the world, and the most graceful, as well as the most grotesque, buildings, from the many-shafted
fantasy of the Alhambra (a building as beautiful in disposition as it is base in ornamentation)
to the four-legged stolidity of the Swiss Chalet:[60] nor these only, but great part of the
effect of our cathedrals, in which, necessarily, the close triforium and clerestory walls are
superimposed on the nave piers; perhaps with most majesty where with greatest simplicity, as
in the old basilican types, and the noble cathedral of Pisa.

§ VIII. In order to the delightfulness and security of all such arrangements, this law must
be observed:--that in proportion to the height of wall above them, the shafts are to be short.
You may take your given height of wall, and turn any quantity of that wall into shaft that
you like; but you must not turn it all into tall shafts, and then put more wall above. Thus,
having a house five stories high, you may turn the lower story into shafts, and leave the four
stories in wall; or the two lower stories into shafts, and leave three in wall; but, whatever
you add to the shaft, you must take from the wall. Then also, of course, the shorter the shaft
the thicker will be its proportionate, if not its actual, diameter. In the Ducal Palace of
Venice the shortest shafts are always the thickest.[61]

§ IX. The second kind of superimposition, lightness on weight, is, in its most necessary use,
of stories of houses one upon another, where, of course, wall veil is required in the lower
ones, and has to support wall veil above, aided by as much of shaft structure as is attainable
within the given limits. The greatest, if not the only, merit of the Roman and Renaissance
Venetian architects is their graceful management of this kind of superimposition; sometimes
of complete courses of external arches and shafts one above the other; sometimes of apertures
with intermediate cornices at the levels of the floors, and large shafts from top to bottom
of the building; always observing that the upper stories shall be at once lighter and richer
than the lower ones. The entire value of such buildings depends upon the perfect and easy expression
of the relative strength of the stories, and the unity obtained by the varieties of their proportions,
while yet the fact of superimposition and separation by floors is frankly told.

§ X. In churches and other buildings in which there is no separation by floors, another kind
of pure shaft superimposition is often used, in order to enable the builder to avail himself
of short and slender shafts. It has been noted that these are often easily attainable, and
of precious materials, when shafts large enough and strong enough to do the work at once, could
not be obtained except at unjustifiable expense, and of coarse stone. The architect has then
no choice but to arrange his work in successive stories; either frankly completing the arch
work and cornice of each, and beginning a new story above it, which is the honester and nobler
way, or else tying the stories together by supplementary shafts from floor to roof,--the general
practice of the Northern Gothic, and one which, unless most gracefully managed, gives the look
of a scaffolding, with cross-poles tied to its uprights, to the whole clerestory wall. The
best method is that which avoids all chance of the upright shafts being supposed continuous,
by increasing their number and changing their places in the upper stories, so that the whole
work branches from the ground like a tree. This is the superimposition of the Byzantine and
the Pisan Romanesque; the most beautiful examples of it being, I think, the Southern portico
of St. Mark's, the church of S. Giovanni at Pistoja, and the apse of the cathedral of Pisa.
In Renaissance work the two principles are equally distinct, though the shafts are (I think)
always one above the other. The reader may see one of the best examples of the separately superimposed
story in Whitehall (and another far inferior in St. Paul's), and by turning himself round at
Whitehall may compare with it the system of connecting shafts in the Treasury; though this
is a singularly bad example, the window cornices of the first floor being like shelves in a
cupboard, and cutting the mass of the building in two, in spite of the pillars.

§ XI. But this superimposition of lightness on weight is still more distinctly the system of
many buildings of the kind which I have above called Architecture of Position, that is to say,
architecture of which the greater part is intended merely to keep something in a peculiar position;
as in light-houses, and many towers and belfries. The subject of spire and tower architecture,
however, is so interesting and extensive, that I have thoughts of writing a detached essay
upon it, and, at all events, cannot enter upon it here: but this much is enough for the reader
to note for our present purpose, that, although many towers do in reality stand on piers or
shafts, as the central towers of cathedrals, yet the expression of all of them, and the real
structure of the best and strongest, are the elevation of gradually diminishing weight on massy
or even solid foundation. Nevertheless, since the tower is in its origin a building for strength
of defence, and faithfulness of watch, rather than splendor of aspect, its true expression
is of just so much diminution of weight upwards as may be necessary to its fully balanced strength,
not a jot more. There must be no light-headedness in your noble tower: impregnable foundation,
wrathful crest, with the vizor down, and the dark vigilance seen through the clefts of it;
not the filigree crown or embroidered cap. No towers are so grand as the square-browed ones,
with massy cornices and rent battlements: next to these come the fantastic towers, with their
various forms of steep roof; the best, not the cone, but the plain gable thrown very high;
last of all in my mind (of good towers), those with spires or crowns, though these, of course,
are fittest for ecclesiastical purposes, and capable of the richest ornament. The paltry four
or eight pinnacled things we call towers in England (as in York Minster), are mere confectioner's
Gothic, and not worth classing.

§ XII. But, in all of them, this I believe to be a point of chief necessity,--that they shall
seem to stand, and shall verily stand, in their own strength; not by help of buttresses nor
artful balancings on this side and on that. Your noble tower must need no help, must be sustained
by no crutches, must give place to no suspicion of decrepitude. Its office may be to withstand
war, look forth for tidings, or to point to heaven: but it must have in its own walls the strength
to do this; it is to be itself a bulwark, not to be sustained by other bulwarks; to rise and
look forth, "the tower of Lebanon that looketh toward Damascus," like a stern sentinel, not
like a child held up in its nurse's arms. A tower may, indeed, have a kind of buttress, a projection,
or subordinate tower at each of its angles; but these are to its main body like the satellites
to a shaft, joined with its strength, and associated in its uprightness, part of the tower
itself: exactly in the proportion in which they lose their massive unity with its body and
assume the form of true buttress walls set on its angles, the tower loses its dignity.

§ XIII. These two characters, then, are common to all noble towers, however otherwise different
in purpose or feature,--the first, that they rise from massy foundation to lighter summits,
frowning with battlements perhaps, but yet evidently more pierced and thinner in wall than
beneath, and, in most ecclesiastical examples, divided into rich open work: the second, that
whatever the form of the tower, it shall not appear to stand by help of buttresses. It follows
from the first condition, as indeed it would have followed from ordinary æsthetic requirements,
that we shall have continual variation in the arrangements of the stories, and the larger number
of apertures towards the top,--a condition exquisitely carried out in the old Lombardic towers,
in which, however small they may be, the number of apertures is always regularly increased
towards the summit; generally one window in the lowest stories, two in the second, then three,
five, and six; often, also, one, two, four, and six, with beautiful symmetries of placing,
not at present to our purpose. We may sufficiently exemplify the general laws of tower building
by placing side by side, drawn to the same scale, a mediæval tower, in which most of them are
simply and unaffectedly observed, and one of our own modern towers, in which every one of them
is violated, in small space, convenient for comparison. (Plate VI.)

§ XIV. The old tower is that of St. Mark's at Venice, not a very perfect example, for its top
is Renaissance, but as good Renaissance as there is in Venice; and it is fit for our present
purpose, because it owes none of its effect to ornament. It is built as simply as it well can
be to answer its purpose: no buttresses; no external features whatever, except some huts at
the base, and the loggia, afterwards built, which, on purpose, I have not drawn; one bold square
mass of brickwork; double walls, with an ascending inclined plane between them, with apertures
as small as possible, and these only in necessary places, giving just the light required for
ascending the stair or slope, not a ray more; and the weight of the whole relieved only by
the double pilasters on the sides, sustaining small arches at the top of the mass, each decorated
with the scallop or cockle shell, presently to be noticed as frequent in Renaissance ornament,
and here, for once, thoroughly well applied. Then, when the necessary height is reached, the
belfry is left open, as in the ordinary Romanesque campanile, only the shafts more slender,
but severe and simple, and the whole crowned by as much spire as the tower would carry, to
render it more serviceable as a landmark. The arrangement is repeated in numberless campaniles
throughout Italy.

§ XV. The one beside it is one of those of the lately built college at Edinburgh. I have not
taken it as worse than many others (just as I have not taken the St. Mark's tower as better
than many others); but it happens to compress our British system of tower building into small
space. The Venetian tower rises 350 feet,[62] and has no buttresses, though built of brick;
the British tower rises 121 feet, and is built of stone, but is supposed to be incapable of
standing without two huge buttresses on each angle. The St. Mark's tower has a high sloping
roof, but carries it simply, requiring no pinnacles at its angles; the British tower has no
visible roof, but has four pinnacles for mere ornament. The Venetian tower has its lightest
part at the top, and is massy at the base; the British tower has its lightest part at the base,
and shuts up its windows into a mere arrowslit at the top. What the tower was built for at
all must therefore, it seems to me, remain a mystery to every beholder; for surely no studious
inhabitant of its upper chambers will be conceived to be pursuing his employments by the light
of the single chink on each side; and, had it been intended for a belfry, the sound of its
bells would have been as effectually prevented from getting out as the light from getting in.

§ XVI. In connexion with the subject of towers and of superimposition, one other feature, not
conveniently to be omitted from our house-building, requires a moment's notice,--the staircase.

In modern houses it can hardly be considered an architectural feature, and is nearly always
an ugly one, from its being apparently without support. And here I may not unfitly note the
important distinction, which perhaps ought to have been dwelt upon in some places before now,
between the marvellous and the perilous in apparent construction. There are many edifices which
are awful or admirable in their height, and lightness, and boldness of form, respecting which,
nevertheless, we have no fear that they should fall. Many a mighty dome and aërial aisle and
arch may seem to stand, as I said, by miracle, but by steadfast miracle notwithstanding; there
is no fear that the miracle should cease. We have a sense of inherent power in them, or, at
all events, of concealed and mysterious provision for their safety. But in leaning towers,
as of Pisa or Bologna, and in much minor architecture, passive architecture, of modern times,
we feel that there is but a chance between the building and destruction; that there is no miraculous
life in it, which animates it into security, but an obstinate, perhaps vain, resistance to
immediate danger. The appearance of this is often as strong in small things as in large; in
the sounding-boards of pulpits, for instance, when sustained by a single pillar behind them,
so that one is in dread, during the whole sermon, of the preacher being crushed if a single
nail should give way; and again, the modern geometrical unsupported staircase. There is great
disadvantage, also, in the arrangement of this latter, when room is of value; and excessive
ungracefulness in its awkward divisions of the passage walls, or windows. In mediæval architecture,
where there was need of room, the staircase was spiral, and enclosed generally in an exterior
tower, which added infinitely to the picturesque effect of the building; nor was the stair
itself steeper nor less commodious than the ordinary compressed straight staircase of a modern
dwelling-house. Many of the richest towers of domestic architecture owe their origin to this
arrangement. In Italy the staircase is often in the open air, surrounding the interior court
of the house, and giving access to its various galleries or loggias: in this case it is almost
always supported by bold shafts and arches, and forms a most interesting additional feature
of the cortile, but presents no peculiarity of construction requiring our present examination.

We may here, therefore, close our inquiries into the subject of construction; nor must the
reader be dissatisfied with the simplicity or apparent barrenness of their present results.
He will find, when he begins to apply them, that they are of more value than they now seem;
but I have studiously avoided letting myself be drawn into any intricate question, because
I wished to ask from the reader only so much attention as it seemed that even the most indifferent
would not be unwilling to pay to a subject which is hourly becoming of greater practical interest.
Evidently it would have been altogether beside the purpose of this essay to have entered deeply
into the abstract science, or closely into the mechanical detail, of construction: both have
been illustrated by writers far more capable of doing so than I, and may be studied at the
reader's discretion; all that has been here endeavored was the leading him to appeal to something
like definite principle, and refer to the easily intelligible laws of convenience and necessity,
whenever he found his judgment likely to be overborne by authority on the one hand, or dazzled
by novelty on the other. If he has time to do more, and to follow out in all their brilliancy
the mechanical inventions of the great engineers and architects of the day, I, in some sort,
envy him, but must part company with him: for my way lies not along the viaduct, but down the
quiet valley which its arches cross, nor through the tunnel, but up the hill-side which its
cavern darkens, to see what gifts Nature will give us, and with what imagery she will fill
our thoughts, that the stones we have ranged in rude order may now be touched with life; nor
lose for ever, in their hewn nakedness, the voices they had of old, when the valley streamlet
eddied round them in palpitating light, and the winds of the hill-side shook over them the
shadows of the fern.

FOOTNOTES:

  [60] I have spent much of my life among the Alps; but I never pass,
    without some feeling of new surprise, the Chalet, standing on its
    four pegs (each topped with a flat stone), balanced in the fury of
    Alpine winds. It is not, perhaps, generally known that the chief use
    of the arrangement is not so much to raise the building above the
    snow, as to get a draught of wind beneath it, which may prevent the
    drift from rising against its sides.

  [62] I have taken Professor Willis's estimate; there being discrepancy
    among various statements. I did not take the trouble to measure the
    height myself, the building being one which does not come within the
    range of our future inquiries; and its exact dimensions, even here,
    are of no importance as respects the question at issue.

CHAPTER XX.

  THE MATERIAL OF ORNAMENT.

§ I. We enter now on the second division of our subject. We have no more to do with heavy stones
and hard lines; we are going to be happy: to look round in the world and discover (in a serious
manner always, however, and under a sense of responsibility) what we like best in it, and to
enjoy the same at our leisure: to gather it, examine it, fasten all we can of it into imperishable
forms, and put it where we may see it for ever.

This is to decorate architecture.

§ II. There are, therefore, three steps in the process: first, to find out in a grave manner
what we like best; secondly, to put as much of this as we can (which is little enough) into
form; thirdly, to put this formed abstraction into a proper place.

And we have now, therefore, to make these three inquiries in succession: first, what we like,
or what is the right material of ornament; then how we are to present it, or its right treatment;
then, where we are to put it, or its right place. I think I can answer that first inquiry in
this Chapter, the second inquiry in the next Chapter, and the third I shall answer in a more
diffusive manner, by taking up in succession the several parts of architecture above distinguished,
and rapidly noting the kind of ornament fittest for each.

§ III. I said in chapter II. § XIV., that all noble ornamentation was the expression of man's
delight in God's work. This implied that there was an ignoble ornamentation, which was the
expression of man's delight in his own. There is such a school, chiefly degraded classic and
Renaissance, in which the ornament is composed of imitations of tilings made by man. I think,
before inquiring what we like best of God's work, we had better get rid of all this imitation
of man's, and be quite sure we do not like that.

§ IV. We shall rapidly glance, then, at the material of decoration hence derived. And now I
cannot, as I before have done respecting construction, convince the reader of one thing being
wrong, and another right. I have confessed as much again and again; I am now only to make appeal
to him, and cross-question him, whether he really does like things or not. If he likes the
ornament on the base of the column of the Place Vendôme, composed of Wellington boots and laced
frock coats, I cannot help it; I can only say I differ from him, and don't like it. And if,
therefore, I speak dictatorially, and say this is base, or degraded, or ugly, I mean, only
that I believe men of the longest experience in the matter would either think it so, or would
be prevented from thinking it so only by some morbid condition of their minds; and I believe
that the reader, if he examine himself candidly, will usually agree in my statements.

§ V. The subjects of ornament found in man's work may properly fall into four heads: 1. Instruments
of art, agriculture, and war; armor, and dress; 2. Drapery; 3. Shipping; 4. Architecture itself.

1. Instruments, armor, and dress.

The custom of raising trophies on pillars, and of dedicating arms in temples, appears to have
first suggested the idea of employing them as the subjects of sculptural ornament: thenceforward,
this abuse has been chiefly characteristic of classical architecture, whether true or Renaissance.
Armor is a noble thing in its proper service and subordination to the body; so is an animal's
hide on its back; but a heap of cast skins, or of shed armor, is alike unworthy of all regard
or imitation. We owe much true sublimity, and more of delightful picturesqueness, to the introduction
of armor both in painting and sculpture: in poetry it is better still,--Homer's undressed Achilles
is less grand than his crested and shielded Achilles, though Phidias would rather have had
him naked; in all mediæval painting, arms, like all other parts of costume, are treated with
exquisite care and delight; in the designs of Leonardo, Raffaelle, and Perugino, the armor
sometimes becomes almost too conspicuous from the rich and endless invention bestowed upon
it; while Titian and Rubens seek in its flash what the Milanese and Perugian sought in its
form, sometimes subordinating heroism to the light of the steel, while the great designers
wearied themselves in its elaborate fancy.

But all this labor was given to the living, not the dead armor; to the shell with its animal
in it, not the cast shell of the beach; and even so, it was introduced more sparingly by the
good sculptors than the good painters; for the former felt, and with justice, that the painter
had the power of conquering the over prominence of costume by the expression and color of the
countenance, and that by the darkness of the eye, and glow of the cheek, he could always conquer
the gloom and the flash of the mail; but they could hardly, by any boldness or energy of the
marble features, conquer the forwardness and conspicuousness of the sharp armorial forms. Their
armed figures were therefore almost always subordinate, their principal figures draped or naked,
and their choice of subject was much influenced by this feeling of necessity. But the Renaissance
sculptors displayed the love of a Camilla for the mere crest and plume. Paltry and false alike
in every feeling of their narrowed minds, they attached themselves, not only to costume without
the person, but to the pettiest details of the costume itself. They could not describe Achilles,
but they could describe his shield; a shield like those of dedicated spoil, without a handle,
never to be waved in the face of war. And then we have helmets and lances, banners and swords,
sometimes with men to hold them, sometimes without; but always chiselled with a tailor-like
love of the chasing or the embroidery,--show helmets of the stage, no Vulcan work on them,
no heavy hammer strokes, no Etna fire in the metal of them, nothing but pasteboard crests and
high feathers. And these, cast together in disorderly heaps, or grinning vacantly over keystones,
form one of the leading decorations of Renaissance architecture, and that one of the best;
for helmets and lances, however loosely laid, are better than violins, and pipes, and books
of music, which were another of the Palladian and Sansovinian sources of ornament. Supported
by ancient authority, the abuse soon became a matter of pride, and since it was easy to copy
a heap of cast clothes, but difficult to manage an arranged design of human figures, the indolence
of architects came to the aid of their affectation, until by the moderns we find the practice
carried out to its most interesting results, and, as above noted, a large pair of boots occupying
the principal place in the bas-reliefs on the base of the Colonne Vendôme.

§ VI. A less offensive, because singularly grotesque, example of the abuse at its height, occurs
in the Hôtel des Invalides, where the dormer windows are suits of armor down to the bottom
of the corselet, crowned by the helmet, and with the window in the middle of the breast.

Instruments of agriculture and the arts are of less frequent occurrence, except in hieroglyphics,
and other work, where they are not employed as ornaments, but represented for the sake of accurate
knowledge, or as symbols. Wherever they have purpose of this kind, they are of course perfectly
right; but they are then part of the building's conversation, not conducive to its beauty.
The French have managed, with great dexterity, the representation of the machinery for the
elevation of their Luxor obelisk, now sculptured on its base.

§ VII. 2. Drapery. I have already spoken of the error of introducing drapery, as such, for
ornament, in the "Seven Lamps." I may here note a curious instance of the abuse in the church
of the Jesuiti at Venice (Renaissance). On first entering you suppose that the church, being
in a poor quarter of the city, has been somewhat meanly decorated by heavy green and white
curtains of an ordinary upholsterer's pattern: on looking closer, they are discovered to be
of marble, with the green pattern inlaid. Another remarkable instance is in a piece of not
altogether unworthy architecture at Paris (Rue Rivoli), where the columns are supposed to be
decorated with images of handkerchiefs tied in a stout knot round the middle of them. This
shrewd invention bids fair to become a new order. Multitudes of massy curtains and various
upholstery, more or less in imitation of that of the drawing-room, are carved and gilt, in
wood or stone, about the altars and other theatrical portions of Romanist churches; but from
these coarse and senseless vulgarities we may well turn, in all haste, to note, with respect
as well as regret, one of the errors of the great school of Niccolo Pisano,--an error so full
of feeling as to be sometimes all but redeemed, and altogether forgiven,--the sculpture, namely,
of curtains around the recumbent statues upon tombs, curtains which angels are represented
as withdrawing, to gaze upon the faces of those who are at rest. For some time the idea was
simply and slightly expressed, and though there was always a painfulness in finding the shafts
of stone, which were felt to be the real supporters of the canopy, represented as of yielding
drapery, yet the beauty of the angelic figures, and the tenderness of the thought, disarmed
all animadversion. But the scholars of the Pisani, as usual, caricatured when they were unable
to invent; and the quiet curtained canopy became a huge marble tent, with a pole in the centre
of it. Thus vulgarised, the idea itself soon disappeared, to make room for urns, torches, and
weepers, and the other modern paraphernalia of the churchyard.

§ VIII. 3. Shipping. I have allowed this kind of subject to form a separate head, owing to
the importance of rostra in Roman decoration, and to the continual occurrence of naval subjects
in modern monumental bas-relief. Mr. Fergusson says, somewhat doubtfully, that he perceives
a "kind of beauty" in a ship: I say, without any manner of doubt, that a ship is one of the
loveliest things man ever made, and one of the noblest; nor do I know any lines, out of divine
work, so lovely as those of the head of a ship, or even as the sweep of the timbers of a small
boat, not a race boat, a mere floating chisel, but a broad, strong, sea boat, able to breast
a wave and break it: and yet, with all this beauty, ships cannot be made subjects of sculpture.
No one pauses in particular delight beneath the pediments of the Admiralty; nor does scenery
of shipping ever become prominent in bas-relief without destroying it: witness the base of
the Nelson pillar. It may be, and must be sometimes, introduced in severe subordination to
the figure subject, but just enough to indicate the scene; sketched in the lightest lines on
the background; never with any attempt at realisation, never with any equality to the force
of the figures, unless the whole purpose of the subject be picturesque. I shall explain this
exception presently, in speaking of imitative architecture.

§ IX. There is one piece of a ship's fittings, however, which may be thought to have obtained
acceptance as a constant element of architectural ornament,--the cable: it is not, however,
the cable itself, but its abstract form, a group of twisted lines (which a cable only exhibits
in common with many natural objects), which is indeed beautiful as an ornament. Make the resemblance
complete, give to the stone the threads and character of the cable, and you may, perhaps, regard
the sculpture with curiosity, but never more with admiration. Consider the effect of the base
of the statue of King William IV. at the end of London Bridge.

§ X. 4. Architecture itself. The erroneous use of armor, or dress, or instruments, or shipping,
as decorative subject, is almost exclusively confined to bad architecture--Roman or Renaissance.
But the false use of architecture itself, as an ornament of architecture, is conspicuous even
in the mediæval work of the best times, and is a grievous fault in some of its noblest examples.

It is, therefore, of great importance to note exactly at what point this abuse begins, and
in what it consists.

§ XI. In all bas-relief, architecture may be introduced as an explanation of the scene in which
the figures act; but with more or less prominence in the inverse ratio of the importance of
the figures.

The metaphysical reason of this is, that where the figures are of great value and beauty, the
mind is supposed to be engaged wholly with them; and it is an impertinence to disturb its contemplation
of them by any minor features whatever. As the figures become of less value, and are regarded
with less intensity, accessory subjects may be introduced, such as the thoughts may have leisure
for.

Thus, if the figures be as large as life, and complete statues, it is gross vulgarity to carve
a temple above them, or distribute them over sculptured rocks, or lead them up steps into pyramids:
I need hardly instance Canova's works,[63] and the Dutch pulpit groups, with fishermen, boats,
and nets, in the midst of church naves.

If the figures be in bas-relief, though as large as life, the scene may be explained by lightly
traced outlines: this is admirably done in the Ninevite marbles.

If the figures be in bas-relief, or even alto-relievo, but less than life, and if their purpose
is rather to enrich a space and produce picturesque shadows, than to draw the thoughts entirely
to themselves, the scenery in which they act may become prominent. The most exquisite examples
of this treatment are the gates of Ghiberti. What would that Madonna of the Annunciation be,
without the little shrine into which she shrinks back? But all mediæval work is full of delightful
examples of the same kind of treatment: the gates of hell and of paradise are important pieces,
both of explanation and effect, in all early representations of the last judgment, or of the
descent into Hades. The keys of St. Peter, and the crushing flat of the devil under his own
door, when it is beaten in, would hardly be understood without the respective gate-ways above.
The best of all the later capitals of the Ducal Palace of Venice depends for great part of
its value on the richness of a small campanile, which is pointed to proudly by a small emperor
in a turned-up hat, who, the legend informs us, is "Numa Pompilio, imperador, edifichador di
tempi e chiese."

§ XII. Shipping may be introduced, or rich fancy of vestments, crowns, and ornaments, exactly
on the same conditions as architecture; and if the reader will look back to my definition of
the picturesque in the "Seven Lamps," he will see why I said, above, that they might only be
prominent when the purpose of the subject was partly picturesque; that is to say, when the
mind is intended to derive part of its enjoyment from the parasitical qualities and accidents
of the thing, not from the heart of the thing itself.

And thus, while we must regret the flapping sails in the death of Nelson in Trafalgar Square,
we may yet most heartily enjoy the sculpture of a storm in one of the bas-reliefs of the tomb
of St. Pietro Martire in the church of St. Eustorgio at Milan, where the grouping of the figures
is most fancifully complicated by the undercut cordage of the vessel.

§ XIII. In all these instances, however, observe that the permission to represent the human
work as an ornament, is conditional on its being necessary to the representation of a scene,
or explanation of an action. On no terms whatever could any such subject be independently admissible.

Observe, therefore, the use of manufacture as ornament is--

  1. With heroic figure sculpture, not admissible at all.
  2. With picturesque figure sculpture, admissible in the degree of its
       picturesqueness.
  3. Without figure sculpture, not admissible at all.

So also in painting: Michael Angelo, in the Sistine Chapel, would not have willingly painted
a dress of figured damask or of watered satin; his was heroic painting, not admitting accessories.

Tintoret, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, and Vandyck, would be very sorry to part with their figured
stuffs and lustrous silks; and sorry, observe, exactly in the degree of their picturesque feeling.
Should not we also be sorry to have Bishop Ambrose without his vest, in that picture of the
National Gallery?

But I think Vandyck would not have liked, on the other hand, the vest without the bishop. I
much doubt if Titian or Veronese would have enjoyed going into Waterloo House, and making studies
of dresses upon the counter.

§ XIV. So, therefore, finally, neither architecture nor any other human work is admissible
as an ornament, except in subordination to figure subject. And this law is grossly and painfully
violated by those curious examples of Gothic, both early and late, in the north, (but late,
I think, exclusively, in Italy,) in which the minor features of the architecture were composed
of small models of the larger: examples which led the way to a series of abuses materially
affecting the life, strength, and nobleness of the Northern Gothic,--abuses which no Ninevite,
nor Egyptian, nor Greek, nor Byzantine, nor Italian of the earlier ages would have endured
for an instant, and which strike me with renewed surprise whenever I pass beneath a portal
of thirteenth century Northern Gothic, associated as they are with manifestations of exquisite
feeling and power in other directions. The porches of Bourges, Amiens, Notre Dame of Paris,
and Notre Dame of Dijon, may be noted as conspicuous in error: small models of feudal towers
with diminutive windows and battlements, of cathedral spires with scaly pinnacles, mixed with
temple pediments and nondescript edifices of every kind, are crowded together over the recess
of the niche into a confused fool's cap for the saint below. Italian Gothic is almost entirely
free from the taint of this barbarism until the Renaissance period, when it becomes rampant
in the cathedral of Como and Certosa of Pavia; and at Venice we find the Renaissance churches
decorated with models of fortifications like those in the Repository at Woolwich, or inlaid
with mock arcades in pseudo-perspective, copied from gardeners' paintings at the ends of conservatories.

§ XV. I conclude, then, with the reader's leave, that all ornament is base which takes for
its subject human work, that it is utterly base,--painful to every rightly-toned mind, without
perhaps immediate sense of the reason, but for a reason palpable enough when we do think of
it. For to carve our own work, and set it up for admiration, is a miserable self-complacency,
a contentment in our own wretched doings, when we might have been looking at God's doings.
And all noble ornament is the exact reverse of this. It is the expression of man's delight
in God's work.

§ XVI. For observe, the function of ornament is to make you happy. Now in what are you rightly
happy? Not in thinking of what you have done yourself; not in your own pride, not your own
birth; not in your own being, or your own will, but in looking at God; watching what He does,
what He is; and obeying His law, and yielding yourself to His will.

You are to be made happy by ornaments; therefore they must be the expression of all this. Not
copies of your own handiwork; not boastings of your own grandeur; not heraldries; not king's
arms, nor any creature's arms, but God's arm, seen in His work. Not manifestation of your delight
in your own laws, or your own liberties, or your own inventions; but in divine laws, constant,
daily, common laws;--not Composite laws, nor Doric laws, nor laws of the five orders, but of
the Ten Commandments.

§ XVII. Then the proper material of ornament will be whatever God has created; and its proper
treatment, that which seems in accordance with or symbolical of His laws. And, for material,
we shall therefore have, first, the abstract lines which are most frequent in nature; and then,
from lower to higher, the whole range of systematised inorganic and organic forms. We shall
rapidly glance in order at their kinds; and, however absurd the elemental division of inorganic
matter by the ancients may seem to the modern chemist, it is one so grand and simple for arrangements
of external appearances, that I shall here follow it; noticing first, after abstract lines,
the imitable forms of the four elements, of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, and then those of
animal organisms. It may be convenient to the reader to have the order stated in a clear succession
at first, thus:--

   1. Abstract lines.
   2. Forms of Earth (Crystals).
   3. Forms of Water (Waves).
   4. Forms of Fire (Flames and Rays).
   5. Forms of Air (Clouds).
   6. (Organic forms.) Shells.
   7. Fish.
   8. Reptiles and insects.
   9. Vegetation (A.) Stems and Trunks.
  10. Vegetation (B.) Foliage.
  11. Birds.
  12. Mammalian animals and Man.

It may be objected that clouds are a form of moisture, not of air. They are, however, a perfect
expression of aërial states and currents, and may sufficiently well stand for the element they
move in. And I have put vegetation apparently somewhat out of its place, owing to its vast
importance as a means of decoration, and its constant association with birds and men.

§ XVIII. 1. Abstract lines. I have not with lines named also shades and colors, for this evident
reason, that there are no such things as abstract shadows, irrespective of the forms which
exhibit them, and distinguished in their own nature from each other; and that the arrangement
of shadows, in greater or less quantity, or in certain harmonical successions, is an affair
of treatment, not of selection. And when we use abstract colors, we are in fact using a part
of nature herself,--using a quality of her light, correspondent with that of the air, to carry
sound; and the arrangement of color in harmonious masses is again a matter of treatment, not
selection. Yet even in this separate art of coloring, as referred to architecture, it is very
notable that the best tints are always those of natural stones. These can hardly be wrong;
I think I never yet saw an offensive introduction of the natural colors of marble and precious
stones, unless in small mosaics, and in one or two glaring instances of the resolute determination
to produce something ugly at any cost. On the other hand, I have most assuredly never yet seen
a painted building, ancient or modern, which seemed to me quite right.

§ XIX. Our first constituents of ornament will therefore be abstract lines, that is to say,
the most frequent contours of natural objects, transferred to architectural forms when it is
not right or possible to render such forms distinctly imitative. For instance, the line or
curve of the edge of a leaf may be accurately given to the edge of a stone, without rendering
the stone in the least like a leaf, or suggestive of a leaf; and this the more fully, because
the lines of nature are alike in all her works; simpler or richer in combination, but the same
in character; and when they are taken out of their combinations it is impossible to say from
which of her works they have been borrowed, their universal property being that of ever-varying
curvature in the most subtle and subdued transitions, with peculiar expressions of motion,
elasticity, or dependence, which I have already insisted upon at some length in the chapters
on typical beauty in "Modern Painters." But, that the reader may here be able to compare them
for himself as deduced from different sources, I have drawn, as accurately as I can, on the
opposite plate, some ten or eleven lines from natural forms of very different substances and
scale: the first, a b, is in the original, I think, the most beautiful simple curve I have
ever seen in my life; it is a curve about three quarters of a mile long, formed by the surface
of a small glacier of the second order, on a spur of the Aiguille de Blaitière (Chamouni).
I have merely outlined the crags on the right of it, to show their sympathy and united action
with the curve of the glacier, which is of course entirely dependent on their opposition to
its descent; softened, however, into unity by the snow, which rarely melts on this high glacier
surface.

The line d c is some mile and a half or two miles long; it is part of the flank of the chain
of the Dent d'Oche above the lake of Geneva, one or two of the lines of the higher and more
distant ranges being given in combination with it.

h is a line about four feet long, a branch of spruce fir. I have taken this tree because it
is commonly supposed to be stiff and ungraceful; its outer sprays are, however, more noble
in their sweep than almost any that I know: but this fragment is seen at great disadvantage,
because placed upside down, in order that the reader may compare its curvatures with c d, e
g, and i k, which are all mountain lines; e g, about five hundred feet of the southern edge
of the Matterhorn; i k, the entire slope of the Aiguille Bouchard, from its summit into the
valley of Chamouni, a line some three miles long; l m is the line of the side of a willow leaf
traced by laying the leaf on the paper; n o, one of the innumerable groups of curves at the
lip of a paper Nautilus; p, a spiral, traced on the paper round a Serpula; q r, the leaf of
the Alisma Plantago with its interior ribs, real size; s t, the side of a bay-leaf; u w, of
a salvia leaf; and it is to be carefully noted that these last curves, being never intended
by nature to be seen singly, are more heavy and less agreeable than any of the others which
would be seen as independent lines. But all agree in their character of changeful curvature,
the mountain and glacier lines only excelling the rest in delicacy and richness of transition.

§ XX. Why lines of this kind are beautiful, I endeavored to show in the "Modern Painters;"
but one point, there omitted, may be mentioned here,--that almost all these lines are expressive
of action of force of some kind, while the circle is a line of limitation or support. In leafage
they mark the forces of its growth and expansion, but some among the most beautiful of them
are described by bodies variously in motion, or subjected to force; as by projectiles in the
air, by the particles of water in a gentle current, by planets in motion in an orbit, by their
satellites, if the actual path of the satellite in space be considered instead of its relation
to the planet; by boats, or birds, turning in the water or air, by clouds in various action
upon the wind, by sails in the curvatures they assume under its force, and by thousands of
other objects moving or bearing force. In the Alisma leaf, q r, the lines through its body,
which are of peculiar beauty, mark the different expansions of its fibres, and are, I think,
exactly the same as those which would be traced by the currents of a river entering a lake
of the shape of the leaf, at the end where the stalk is, and passing out at its point. Circular
curves, on the contrary, are always, I think, curves of limitation or support; that is to say,
curves of perfect rest. The cylindrical curve round the stem of a plant binds its fibres together;
while the ascent of the stem is in lines of various curvature: so the curve of the horizon
and of the apparent heaven, of the rainbow, etc.: and though the reader might imagine that
the circular orbit of any moving body, or the curve described by a sling, was a curve of motion,
he should observe that the circular character is given to the curve not by the motion, but
by the confinement: the circle is the consequence not of the energy of the body, but of its
being forbidden to leave the centre; and whenever the whirling or circular motion can be fully
impressed on it we obtain instant balance and rest with respect to the centre of the circle.

Hence the peculiar fitness of the circular curve as a sign of rest, and security of support,
in arches; while the other curves, belonging especially to action, are to be used in the more
active architectural features--the hand and foot (the capital and base), and in all minor ornaments;
more freely in proportion to their independence of structural conditions.

§ XXI. We need not, however, hope to be able to imitate, in general work, any of the subtly
combined curvatures of nature's highest designing: on the contrary, their extreme refinement
renders them unfit for coarse service or material. Lines which are lovely in the pearly film
of the Nautilus shell, are lost in the grey roughness of stone; and those which are sublime
in the blue of far away hills, are weak in the substance of incumbent marble. Of all the graceful
lines assembled on Plate VII., we shall do well to be content with two of the simplest. We
shall take one mountain line (e g) and one leaf line (u w), or rather fragments of them, for
we shall perhaps not want them all. I will mark off from u w the little bit x y, and from e
g the piece e f; both which appear to me likely to be serviceable: and if hereafter we need
the help of any abstract lines, we will see what we can do with these only.

§ XXII. 2. Forms of Earth (Crystals). It may be asked why I do not say rocks or mountains?
Simply, because the nobility of these depends, first, on their scale, and, secondly, on accident.
Their scale cannot be represented, nor their accident systematised. No sculptor can in the
least imitate the peculiar character of accidental fracture: he can obey or exhibit the laws
of nature, but he cannot copy the felicity of her fancies, nor follow the steps of her fury.
The very glory of a mountain is in the revolutions which raised it into power, and the forces
which are striking it into ruin. But we want no cold and careful imitation of catastrophe;
no calculated mockery of convulsion; no delicate recommendation of ruin. We are to follow the
labor of Nature, but not her disturbance; to imitate what she has deliberately ordained,[64]
not what she has violently suffered, or strangely permitted. The only uses, therefore, of rock
form which are wise in the architect, are its actual introduction (by leaving untouched such
blocks as are meant for rough service), and that noble use of the general examples of mountain
structure of which I have often heretofore spoken. Imitations of rock form have, for the most
part, been confined to periods of degraded feeling and to architectural toys or pieces of dramatic
effect,--the Calvaries and holy sepulchres of Romanism, or the grottoes and fountains of English
gardens. They were, however, not unfrequent in mediæval bas-reliefs; very curiously and elaborately
treated by Ghiberti on the doors of Florence, and in religious sculpture necessarily introduced
wherever the life of the anchorite was to be expressed. They were rarely introduced as of ornamental
character, but for particular service and expression; we shall see an interesting example in
the Ducal Palace at Venice.

§ XXIII. But against crystalline form, which is the completely systematised natural structure
of the earth, none of these objections hold good, and, accordingly, it is an endless element
of decoration, where higher conditions of structure cannot be represented. The four-sided pyramid,
perhaps the most frequent of all natural crystals, is called in architecture a dogtooth; its
use is quite limitless, and always beautiful: the cube and rhomb are almost equally frequent
in chequers and dentils: and all mouldings of the middle Gothic are little more than representations
of the canaliculated crystals of the beryl, and such other minerals:

§ XXIV. Not knowingly. I do not suppose a single hint was ever actually taken from mineral
form; not even by the Arabs in their stalactite pendants and vaults: all that I mean to allege
is, that beautiful ornament, wherever found, or however invented, is always either an intentional
or unintentional copy of some constant natural form; and that in this particular instance,
the pleasure we have in these geometrical figures of our own invention, is dependent for all
its acuteness on the natural tendency impressed on us by our Creator to love the forms into
which the earth He gave us to tread, and out of which He formed our bodies, knit itself as
it was separated from the deep.

§ XXV. 3. Forms of Water (Waves).

The reasons which prevent rocks from being used for ornament repress still more forcibly the
portraiture of the sea. Yet the constant necessity of introducing some representation of water
in order to explain the scene of events, or as a sacred symbol, has forced the sculptors of
all ages to the invention of some type or letter for it, if not an actual imitation. We find
every degree of conventionalism or of naturalism in these types, the earlier being, for the
most part, thoughtful symbols; the latter, awkward attempts at portraiture.[65] The most conventional
of all types is the Egyptian zigzag, preserved in the astronomical sign of Aquarius; but every
nation, with any capacities of thought, has given, in some of its work, the same great definition
of open water, as "an undulatory thing with fish in it." I say open water, because inland nations
have a totally different conception of the element. Imagine for an instant the different feelings
of an husbandman whose hut is built by the Rhine or the Po, and who sees, day by day, the same
giddy succession of silent power, the same opaque, thick, whirling, irresistible labyrinth
of rushing lines and twisted eddies, coiling themselves into serpentine race by the reedy banks,
in omne volubilis ævum,--and the image of the sea in the mind of the fisher upon the rocks
of Ithaca, or by the Straits of Sicily, who sees how, day by day, the morning winds come coursing
to the shore, every breath of them with a green wave rearing before it; clear, crisp, ringing,
merry-minded waves, that fall over and over each other, laughing like children as they near
the beach, and at last clash themselves all into dust of crystal over the dazzling sweeps of
sand. Fancy the difference of the image of water in those two minds, and then compare the sculpture
of the coiling eddies of the Tigris and its reedy branches in those slabs of Nineveh, with
the crested curls of the Greek sea on the coins of Camerina or Tarentum. But both agree in
the undulatory lines, either of the currents or the surface, and in the introduction of fish
as explanatory of the meaning of those lines (so also the Egyptians in their frescoes, with
most elaborate realisation of the fish). There is a very curious instance on a Greek mirror
in the British Museum, representing Orion on the Sea; and multitudes of examples with dolphins
on the Greek vases: the type is preserved without alteration in mediæval painting and sculpture.
The sea in that Greek mirror (at least 400 B.C.), in the mosaics of Torcello and St. Mark's,
on the font of St. Frediano at Lucca, on the gate of the fortress of St. Michael's Mount in
Normandy, on the Bayeux tapestry, and on the capitals of the Ducal Palace at Venice (under
Arion on his Dolphin), is represented in a manner absolutely identical. Giotto, in the frescoes
of Avignon, has, with his usual strong feeling for naturalism, given the best example I remember,
in painting, of the unity of the conventional system with direct imitation, and that both in
sea and river; giving in pure blue color the coiling whirlpool of the stream, and the curled
crest of the breaker. But in all early sculptural examples, both imitation and decorative effect
are subordinate to easily understood symbolical language; the undulatory lines are often valuable
as an enrichment of surface, but are rarely of any studied gracefulness. One of the best examples
I know of their expressive arrangement is around some figures in a spandril at Bourges, representing
figures sinking in deep sea (the deluge): the waved lines yield beneath the bodies and wildly
lave the edge of the moulding, two birds, as if to mark the reverse of all order of nature,
lowest of all sunk in the depth of them. In later times of debasement, water began to be represented
with its waves, foam, etc., as on the Vendramin tomb at Venice, above cited; but even there,
without any definite ornamental purpose, the sculptor meant partly to explain a story, partly
to display dexterity of chiselling, but not to produce beautiful forms pleasant to the eye.
The imitation is vapid and joyless, and it has often been matter of surprise to me that sculptors,
so fond of exhibiting their skill, should have suffered this imitation to fall so short, and
remain so cold,--should not have taken more pains to curl the waves clearly, to edge them sharply,
and to express, by drill-holes or other artifices, the character of foam. I think in one of
the Antwerp churches something of this kind is done in wood, but in general it is rare.

§ XXVI. 4. Forms of Fire (Flames and Rays). If neither the sea nor the rock can be imagined,
still less the devouring fire. It has been symbolised by radiation both in painting and sculpture,
for the most part in the latter very unsuccessfully. It was suggested to me, not long ago,[66]
that zigzag decorations of Norman architects were typical of light springing from the half-set
orb of the sun; the resemblance to the ordinary sun type is indeed remarkable, but I believe
accidental. I shall give you, in my large plates, two curious instances of radiation in brick
ornament above arches, but I think these also without any very luminous intention. The imitations
of fire in the torches of Cupids and genii, and burning in tops of urns, which attest and represent
the mephitic inspirations of the seventeenth century in most London churches, and in monuments
all over civilised Europe, together with the gilded rays of Romanist altars, may be left to
such mercy as the reader is inclined to show them.

§ XXVII. 5. Forms of Air (Clouds). Hardly more manageable than flames, and of no ornamental
use, their majesty being in scale and color, and inimitable in marble. They are lightly traced
in much of the cinque cento sculpture; very boldly and grandly in the strange Last Judgment
in the porch of St. Maclou at Rouen, described in the "Seven Lamps." But the most elaborate
imitations are altogether of recent date, arranged in concretions like flattened sacks, forty
or fifty feet above the altars of continental churches, mixed with the gilded truncheons intended
for sunbeams above alluded to.

§ XXVIII. 6. Shells. I place these lowest in the scale (after inorganic forms) as being moulds
or coats of organism; not themselves organic. The sense of this, and of their being mere emptiness
and deserted houses, must always prevent them, however beautiful in their lines, from being
largely used in ornamentation. It is better to take the line and leave the shell. One form,
indeed, that of the cockle, has been in all ages used as the decoration of half domes, which
were named conchas from their shell form: and I believe the wrinkled lip of the cockle, so
used, to have been the origin, in some parts of Europe at least, of the exuberant foliation
of the round arch. The scallop also is a pretty radiant form, and mingles well with other symbols
when it is needed. The crab is always as delightful as a grotesque, for here we suppose the
beast inside the shell; and he sustains his part in a lively manner among the other signs of
the zodiac, with the scorpion; or scattered upon sculptured shores, as beside the Bronze Boar
of Florence. We shall find him in a basket at Venice, at the base of one of the Piazzetta shafts.

§ XXIX. 7. Fish. These, as beautiful in their forms as they are familiar to our sight, while
their interest is increased by their symbolic meaning, are of great value as material of ornament.
Love of the picturesque has generally induced a choice of some supple form with scaly body
and lashing tail, but the simplest fish form is largely employed in mediæval work. We shall
find the plain oval body and sharp head of the Thunny constantly at Venice; and the fish used
in the expression of sea-water, or water generally, are always plain bodied creatures in the
best mediæval sculpture. The Greek type of the dolphin, however, sometimes but slightly exaggerated
from the real outline of the Delphinus Delphis,[67] is one of the most picturesque of animal
forms; and the action of its slow revolving plunge is admirably caught upon the surface sea
represented in Greek vases.

§ XXX. 8. Reptiles and Insects. The forms of the serpent and lizard exhibit almost every element
of beauty and horror in strange combination; the horror, which in an imitation is felt only
as a pleasurable excitement, has rendered them favorite subjects in all periods of art; and
the unity of both lizard and serpent in the ideal dragon, the most picturesque and powerful
of all animal forms, and of peculiar symbolical interest to the Christian mind, is perhaps
the principal of all the materials of mediæval picturesque sculpture. By the best sculptors
it is always used with this symbolic meaning, by the cinque cento sculptors as an ornament
merely. The best and most natural representations of mere viper or snake are to be found interlaced
among their confused groups of meaningless objects. The real power and horror of the snake-head
has, however, been rarely reached. I shall give one example from Verona of the twelfth century.

Other less powerful reptile forms are not unfrequent. Small frogs, lizards, and snails almost
always enliven the foregrounds and leafage of good sculpture. The tortoise is less usually
employed in groups. Beetles are chiefly mystic and colossal. Various insects, like everything
else in the world, occur in cinque cento work; grasshoppers most frequently. We shall see on
the Ducal Palace at Venice an interesting use of the bee.

§ XXXI. 9. Branches and stems of Trees. I arrange these under a separate head; because, while
the forms of leafage belong to all architecture, and ought to be employed in it always, those
of the branch and stem belong to a peculiar imitative and luxuriant architecture, and are only
applicable at times. Pagan sculptors seem to have perceived little beauty in the stems of trees;
they were little else than timber to them; and they preferred the rigid and monstrous triglyph,
or the fluted column, to a broken bough or gnarled trunk. But with Christian knowledge came
a peculiar regard for the forms of vegetation, from the root upwards. The actual representation
of the entire trees required in many scripture subjects,--as in the most frequent of Old Testament
subjects, the Fall; and again in the Drunkenness of Noah, the Garden Agony, and many others,
familiarised the sculptors of bas-relief to the beauty of forms before unknown; while the symbolical
name given to Christ by the Prophets, "the Branch," and the frequent expressions referring
to this image throughout every scriptural description of conversion, gave an especial interest
to the Christian mind to this portion of vegetative structure. For some time, nevertheless,
the sculpture of trees was confined to bas-relief; but it at last affected even the treatment
of the main shafts in Lombard Gothic buildings,--as in the western façade of Genoa, where two
of the shafts are represented as gnarled trunks: and as bas-relief itself became more boldly
introduced, so did tree sculpture, until we find the writhed and knotted stems of the vine
and fig used for angle shafts on the Doge's Palace, and entire oaks and appletrees forming,
roots and all, the principal decorative sculptures of the Scala tombs at Verona. It was then
discovered to be more easy to carve branches than leaves and, much helped by the frequent employment
in later Gothic of the "Tree of Jesse," for traceries and other purposes, the system reached
full developement in a perfect thicket of twigs, which form the richest portion of the decoration
of the porches of Beauvais. It had now been carried to its richest extreme: men wearied of
it and abandoned it, and like all other natural and beautiful things, it was ostracised by
the mob of Renaissance architects. But it is interesting to observe how the human mind, in
its acceptance of this feature of ornament, proceeded from the ground, and followed, as it
were, the natural growth of the tree. It began with the rude and solid trunk, as at Genoa;
then the branches shot out, and became loaded leaves; autumn came, the leaves were shed, and
the eye was directed to the extremities of the delicate branches;--the Renaissance frosts came,
and all perished.

§ XXXII. 10. Foliage, Flowers, and Fruit. It is necessary to consider these as separated from
the stems; not only, as above noted, because their separate use marks another school of architecture,
but because they are the only organic structures which are capable of being so treated, and
intended to be so, without strong effort of imagination. To pull animals to pieces, and use
their paws for feet of furniture, or their heads for terminations of rods and shafts, is usually
the characteristic of feelingless schools; the greatest men like their animals whole. The head
may, indeed, be so managed as to look emergent from the stone, rather than fastened to it;
and wherever there is throughout the architecture any expression of sternness or severity (severity
in its literal sense, as in Romans, XI. 22), such divisions of the living form may be permitted;
still, you cannot cut an animal to pieces as you can gather a flower or a leaf. These were
intended for our gathering, and for our constant delight: wherever men exist in a perfectly
civilised and healthy state, they have vegetation around them; wherever their state approaches
that of innocence or perfectness, it approaches that of Paradise,--it is a dressing of garden.
And, therefore, where nothing else can be used for ornament, vegetation may; vegetation in
any form, however fragmentary, however abstracted. A single leaf laid upon the angle of a stone,
or the mere form or frame-work of the leaf drawn upon it, or the mere shadow and ghost of the
leaf,--the hollow "foil" cut out of it,--possesses a charm which nothing else can replace;
a charm not exciting, nor demanding laborious thought or sympathy, but perfectly simple, peaceful,
and satisfying.

§ XXXIII. The full recognition of leaf forms, as the general source of subordinate decoration,
is one of the chief characteristics of Christian architecture; but the two roots of leaf ornament
are the Greek acanthus, and the Egyptian lotus.[68] The dry land and the river thus each contributed
their part; and all the florid capitals of the richest Northern Gothic on the one hand, and
the arrowy lines of the severe Lombardic capitals on the other, are founded on these two gifts
of the dust of Greece and the waves of the Nile. The leaf which is, I believe, called the Persepolitan
water-leaf, is to be associated with the lotus flower and stem, as the origin of our noblest
types of simple capital; and it is to be noted that the florid leaves of the dry land are used
most by the Northern architects, while the water leaves are gathered for their ornaments by
the parched builders of the Desert.

§ XXXIV. Fruit is, for the most part, more valuable in color than form; nothing is more beautiful
as a subject of sculpture on a tree; but, gathered and put in baskets, it is quite possible
to have too much of it. We shall find it so used very dextrously on the Ducal Palace of Venice,
there with a meaning which rendered it right necessary; but the Renaissance architects address
themselves to spectators who care for nothing but feasting, and suppose that clusters of pears
and pineapples are visions of which their imagination can never weary, and above which it will
never care to rise. I am no advocate for image worship, as I believe the reader will elsewhere
sufficiently find; but I am very sure that the Protestantism of London would have found itself
quite as secure in a cathedral decorated with statues of good men, as in one hung round with
bunches of ribston pippins.

§ XXXV. 11. Birds. The perfect and simple grace of bird form, in general, has rendered it a
favorite subject with early sculptors, and with those schools which loved form more than action;
but the difficulty of expressing action, where the muscular markings are concealed, has limited
the use of it in later art. Half the ornament, at least, in Byzantine architecture, and a third
of that of Lombardic, is composed of birds, either pecking at fruit or flowers, or standing
on either side of a flower or vase, or alone, as generally the symbolical peacock. But how
much of our general sense of grace or power of motion, of serenity, peacefulness, and spirituality,
we owe to these creatures, it is impossible to conceive; their wings supplying us with almost
the only means of representation of spiritual motion which we possess, and with an ornamental
form of which the eye is never weary, however meaninglessly or endlessly repeated; whether
in utter isolation, or associated with the bodies of the lizard, the horse, the lion, or the
man. The heads of the birds of prey are always beautiful, and used as the richest ornaments
in all ages.

§ XXXVI. 12. Quadrupeds and Men. Of quadrupeds the horse has received an elevation into the
primal rank of sculptural subject, owing to his association with men. The full value of other
quadruped forms has hardly been perceived, or worked for, in late sculpture; and the want of
science is more felt in these subjects than in any other branches of early work. The greatest
richness of quadruped ornament is found in the hunting sculpture of the Lombards; but rudely
treated (the most noble examples of treatment being the lions of Egypt, the Ninevite bulls,
and the mediæval griffins). Quadrupeds of course form the noblest subjects of ornament next
to the human form; this latter, the chief subject of sculpture, being sometimes the end of
architecture rather than its decoration.

We have thus completed the list of the materials of architectural decoration, and the reader
may be assured that no effort has ever been successful to draw elements of beauty from any
other sources than these. Such an effort was once resolutely made. It was contrary to the religion
of the Arab to introduce any animal form into his ornament; but although all the radiance of
color, all the refinements of proportion, and all the intricacies of geometrical design were
open to him, he could not produce any noble work without an abstraction of the forms of leafage,
to be used in his capitals, and made the ground plan of his chased ornament. But I have above
noted that coloring is an entirely distinct and independent art; and in the "Seven Lamps" we
saw that this art had most power when practised in arrangements of simple geometrical form:
the Arab, therefore, lay under no disadvantage in coloring, and he had all the noble elements
of constructive and proportional beauty at his command: he might not imitate the sea-shell,
but he could build the dome. The imitation of radiance by the variegated voussoir, the expression
of the sweep of the desert by the barred red lines upon the wall, the starred inshedding of
light through his vaulted roof, and all the endless fantasy of abstract line,[69] were still
in the power of his ardent and fantastic spirit. Much he achieved; and yet in the effort of
his overtaxed invention, restrained from its proper food, he made his architecture a glittering
vacillation of undisciplined enchantment, and left the lustre of its edifices to wither like
a startling dream, whose beauty we may indeed feel, and whose instruction we may receive, but
must smile at its inconsistency, and mourn over its evanescence.

CHAPTER XXI.

  TREATMENT OF ORNAMENT.

§ I. We now know where we are to look for subjects of decoration. The next question is, as
the reader must remember, how to treat or express these subjects.

There are evidently two branches of treatment: the first being the expression, or rendering
to the eye and mind, of the thing itself; and the second, the arrangement of the thing so expressed:
both of these being quite distinct from the placing of the ornament in proper parts of the
building. For instance, suppose we take a vine-leaf for our subject. The first question is,
how to cut the vine-leaf? Shall we cut its ribs and notches on the edge, or only its general
outline? and so on. Then, how to arrange the vine-leaves when we have them; whether symmetrically,
or at random; or unsymmetrically, yet within certain limits? All these I call questions of
treatment. Then, whether the vine-leaves so arranged are to be set on the capital of a pillar
or on its shaft, I call a question of place.

§ II. So, then, the questions of mere treatment are twofold, how to express, and how to arrange.
And expression is to the mind or the sight. Therefore, the inquiry becomes really threefold:--

  1. How ornament is to be expressed with reference to the mind.

  2. How ornament is to be arranged with reference to the sight.

  3. How ornament is to be arranged with reference to both.

§ III. (1.) How is ornament to be treated with reference to the mind?

If, to produce a good or beautiful ornament, it were only necessary to produce a perfect piece
of sculpture, and if a well cut group of flowers or animals were indeed an ornament wherever
it might be placed, the work of the architect would be comparatively easy. Sculpture and architecture
would become separate arts; and the architect would order so many pieces of such subject and
size as he needed, without troubling himself with any questions but those of disposition and
proportion. But this is not so. No perfect piece either of painting or sculpture is an architectural
ornament at all, except in that vague sense in which any beautiful thing is said to ornament
the place it is in. Thus we say that pictures ornament a room; but we should not thank an architect
who told us that his design, to be complete, required a Titian to be put in one corner of it,
and a Velasquez in the other; and it is just as unreasonable to call perfect sculpture, niched
in, or encrusted on a building, a portion of the ornament of that building, as it would be
to hang pictures by the way of ornament on the outside of it. It is very possible that the
sculptured work may be harmoniously associated with the building, or the building executed
with reference to it; but in this latter case the architecture is subordinate to the sculpture,
as in the Medicean chapel, and I believe also in the Parthenon. And so far from the perfection
of the work conducing to its ornamental purpose, we may say, with entire security, that its
perfection, in some degree, unfits it for its purpose, and that no absolutely complete sculpture
can be decoratively right. We have a familiar instance in the flower-work of St. Paul's, which
is probably, in the abstract, as perfect flower sculpture as could be produced at the time;
and which is just as rational an ornament of the building as so many valuable Van Huysums,
framed and glazed and hung up over each window.

§ IV. The especial condition of true ornament is, that it be beautiful in its place, and nowhere
else, and that it aid the effect of every portion of the building over which it has influence;
that it does not, by its richness, make other parts bald, or, by its delicacy, make other parts
coarse. Every one of its qualities has reference to its place and use: and it is fitted for
its service by what would be faults and deficiencies if it had no especial duty. Ornament,
the servant, is often formal, where sculpture, the master, would have been free; the servant
is often silent where the master would have been eloquent; or hurried, where the master would
have been serene.

§ V. How far this subordination is in different situations to be expressed, or how far it may
be surrendered, and ornament, the servant, be permitted to have independent will; and by what
means the subordination is best to be expressed when it is required, are by far the most difficult
questions I have ever tried to work out respecting any branch of art; for, in many of the examples
to which I look as authoritative in their majesty of effect, it is almost impossible to say
whether the abstraction or imperfection of the sculpture was owing to the choice, or the incapacity
of the workman; and, if to the latter, how far the result of fortunate incapacity can be imitated
by prudent self-restraint. The reader, I think, will understand this at once by considering
the effect of the illuminations of an old missal. In their bold rejection of all principles
of perspective, light and shade, and drawing, they are infinitely more ornamental to the page,
owing to the vivid opposition of their bright colors and quaint lines, than if they had been
drawn by Da Vinci himself: and so the Arena chapel is far more brightly decorated by the archaic
frescoes of Giotti, than the Stanze of the Vatican are by those of Raffaelle. But how far it
is possible to recur to such archaicism, or to make up for it by any voluntary abandonment
of power, I cannot as yet venture in any wise to determine.

§ VI. So, on the other hand, in many instances of finished work in which I find most to regret
or to reprobate, I can hardly distinguish what is erroneous in principle from what is vulgar
in execution. For instance, in most Romanesque churches of Italy, the porches are guarded by
gigantic animals, lions or griffins, of admirable severity of design; yet, in many cases, of
so rude workmanship, that it can hardly be determined how much of this severity was intentional,--how
much involuntary: in the cathedral of Genoa two modern lions have, in imitation of this ancient
custom, been placed on the steps of its west front; and the Italian sculptor, thinking himself
a marvellous great man because he knew what lions were really like, has copied them, in the
menagerie, with great success, and produced two hairy and well-whiskered beasts, as like to
real lions as he could possibly cut them. One wishes them back in the menagerie for his pains;
but it is impossible to say how far the offence of their presence is owing to the mere stupidity
and vulgarity of the sculpture, and how far we might have been delighted with a realisation,
carried to nearly the same length by Ghiberti or Michael Angelo. (I say nearly, because neither
Ghiberti nor Michael Angelo would ever have attempted, or permitted, entire realisation, even
in independent sculpture.)

§ VII. In spite of these embarrassments, however, some few certainties may be marked in the
treatment of past architecture, and secure conclusions deduced for future practice. There is
first, for instance, the assuredly intended and resolute abstraction of the Ninevite and Egyptian
sculptors. The men who cut those granite lions in the Egyptian room of the British Museum,
and who carved the calm faces of those Ninevite kings, knew much more, both of lions and kings,
than they chose to express. Then there is the Greek system, in which the human sculpture is
perfect, the architecture and animal sculpture is subordinate to it, and the architectural
ornament severely subordinated to this again, so as to be composed of little more than abstract
lines: and, finally, there is the peculiarly mediæval system, in which the inferior details
are carried to as great or greater imitative perfection as the higher sculpture; and the subordination
is chiefly effected by symmetries of arrangement, and quaintnesses of treatment, respecting
which it is difficult to say how far they resulted from intention, and how far from incapacity.

§ VIII. Now of these systems, the Ninevite and Egyptian are altogether opposed to modern habits
of thought and action; they are sculptures evidently executed under absolute authorities, physical
and mental, such as cannot at present exist. The Greek system presupposes the possession of
a Phidias; it is ridiculous to talk of building in the Greek manner; you may build a Greek
shell or box, such as the Greek intended to contain sculpture, but you have not the sculpture
to put in it. Find your Phidias first, and your new Phidias will very soon settle all your
architectural difficulties in very unexpected ways indeed; but until you find him, do not think
yourselves architects while you go on copying those poor subordinations, and secondary and
tertiary orders of ornament, which the Greek put on the shell of his sculpture. Some of them,
beads, and dentils, and such like, are as good as they can be for their work, and you may use
them for subordinate work still; but they are nothing to be proud of, especially when you did
not invent them: and others of them are mistakes and impertinences in the Greek himself, such
as his so-called honeysuckle ornaments and others, in which there is a starched and dull suggestion
of vegetable form, and yet no real resemblance nor life, for the conditions of them result
from his own conceit of himself, and ignorance of the physical sciences, and want of relish
for common nature, and vain fancy that he could improve everything he touched, and that he
honored it by taking it into his service: by freedom from which conceits the true Christian
architecture is distinguished--not by points to its arches.

§ IX. There remains, therefore, only the mediæval system, in which I think, generally, more
completion is permitted (though this often because more was possible) in the inferior than
in the higher portions of ornamental subject. Leaves, and birds, and lizards are realised,
or nearly so; men and quadrupeds formalised. For observe, the smaller and inferior subject
remains subordinate, however richly finished; but the human sculpture can only be subordinate
by being imperfect. The realisation is, however, in all cases, dangerous except under most
skilful management, and the abstraction, if true and noble, is almost always more delightful.[70]

§ X. What, then, is noble abstraction? It is taking first the essential elements of the thing
to be represented, then the rest in the order of importance (so that wherever we pause we shall
always have obtained more than we leave behind), and using any expedient to impress what we
want upon the mind, without caring about the mere literal accuracy of such expedient. Suppose,
for instance, we have to represent a peacock: now a peacock has a graceful neck, so has a swan;
it has a high crest, so has a cockatoo; it has a long tail, so has a bird of Paradise. But
the whole spirit and power of peacock is in those eyes of the tail. It is true, the argus pheasant,
and one or two more birds, have something like them, but nothing for a moment comparable to
them in brilliancy: express the gleaming of the blue eyes through the plumage, and you have
nearly all you want of peacock, but without this, nothing; and yet those eyes are not in relief;
a rigidly true sculpture of a peacock's form could have no eyes,--nothing but feathers. Here,
then, enters the stratagem of sculpture; you must cut the eyes in relief, somehow or another;
see how it is done in the peacock on the opposite page; it is so done by nearly all the Byzantine
sculptors: this particular peacock is meant to be seen at some distance (how far off I know
not, for it is an interpolation in the building where it occurs, of which more hereafter),
but at all events at a distance of thirty or forty feet; I have put it close to you that you
may see plainly the rude rings and rods which stand for the eyes and quills, but at the just
distance their effect is perfect.

§ XI. And the simplicity of the means here employed may help us, both to some clear understanding
of the spirit of Ninevite and Egyptian work, and to some perception of the kind of enfantillage
or archaicism to which it may be possible, even in days of advanced science, legitimately to
return. The architect has no right, as we said before, to require of us a picture of Titian's
in order to complete his design; neither has he the right to calculate on the co-operation
of perfect sculptors, in subordinate capacities. Far from this; his business is to dispense
with such aid altogether, and to devise such a system of ornament as shall be capable of execution
by uninventive and even unintelligent workmen; for supposing that he required noble sculpture
for his ornament, how far would this at once limit the number and the scale of possible buildings?
Architecture is the work of nations; but we cannot have nations of great sculptors. Every house
in every street of every city ought to be good architecture, but we cannot have Flaxman or
Thorwaldsen at work upon it: nor, even if we chose only to devote ourselves to our public buildings,
could the mass and majesty of them be great, if we required all to be executed by great men;
greatness is not to be had in the required quantity. Giotto may design a campanile, but he
cannot carve it; he can only carve one or two of the bas-reliefs at the base of it. And with
every increase of your fastidiousness in the execution of your ornament, you diminish the possible
number and grandeur of your buildings. Do not think you can educate your workmen, or that the
demand for perfection will increase the supply: educated imbecility and finessed foolishness
are the worst of all imbecilities and foolishnesses; and there is no free-trade measure, which
will ever lower the price of brains,--there is no California of common sense. Exactly in the
degree in which you require your decoration to be wrought by thoughtful men, you diminish the
extent and number of architectural works. Your business as an architect, is to calculate only
on the co-operation of inferior men, to think for them, and to indicate for them such expressions
of your thoughts as the weakest capacity can comprehend and the feeblest hand can execute.
This is the definition of the purest architectural abstractions. They are the deep and laborious
thoughts of the greatest men, put into such easy letters that they can be written by the simplest.
They are expressions of the mind of manhood by the hands of childhood.

§ XII. And now suppose one of those old Ninevite or Egyptian builders, with a couple of thousand
men--mud-bred, onion-eating creatures--under him, to be set to work, like so many ants, on
his temple sculptures. What is he to do with them? He can put them through a granitic exercise
of current hand; he can teach them all how to curl hair thoroughly into croche-coeurs, as you
teach a bench of school-boys how to shape pothooks; he can teach them all how to draw long
eyes and straight noses, and how to copy accurately certain well-defined lines. Then he fits
his own great design to their capacities; he takes out of king, or lion, or god, as much as
was expressible by croche-coeurs and granitic pothooks; he throws this into noble forms of
his own imagining, and having mapped out their lines so that there can be no possibility of
error, sets his two thousand men to work upon them, with a will, and so many onions a day.

§ XIII. I said those times cannot now return. We have, with Christianity, recognised the individual
value of every soul; and there is no intelligence so feeble but that its single ray may in
some sort contribute to the general light. This is the glory of Gothic architecture, that every
jot and tittle, every point and niche of it, affords room, fuel, and focus for individual fire.
But you cease to acknowledge this, and you refuse to accept the help of the lesser mind, if
you require the work to be all executed in a great manner. Your business is to think out all
of it nobly, to dictate the expression of it as far as your dictation can assist the less elevated
intelligence: then to leave this, aided and taught as far as may be, to its own simple act
and effort; and to rejoice in its simplicity if not in its power, and in its vitality if not
in its science.

§ XIV. We have, then, three orders of ornament, classed according to the degrees of correspondence
of the executive and conceptive minds. We have the servile ornament, in which the executive
is absolutely subjected to the inventive,--the ornament of the great Eastern nations, more
especially Hamite, and all pre-Christian, yet thoroughly noble in its submissiveness. Then
we have the mediæval system, in which the mind of the inferior workman is recognised, and has
full room for action, but is guided and ennobled by the ruling mind. This is the truly Christian
and only perfect system. Finally, we have ornaments expressing the endeavor to equalise the
executive and inventive,--endeavor which is Renaissance and revolutionary, and destructive
of all noble architecture.

§ XV. Thus far, then, of the incompleteness or simplicity of execution necessary in architectural
ornament, as referred to the mind. Next we have to consider that which is required when it
is referred to the sight, and the various modifications of treatment which are rendered necessary
by the variation of its distance from the eye. I say necessary: not merely expedient or economical.
It is foolish to carve what is to be seen forty feet off with the delicacy which the eye demands
within two yards; not merely because such delicacy is lost in the distance, but because it
is a great deal worse than lost:--the delicate work has actually worse effect in the distance
than rough work. This is a fact well known to painters, and, for the most part, acknowledged
by the critics of painters, namely, that there is a certain distance for which a picture is
painted; and that the finish, which is delightful if that distance be small, is actually injurious
if the distance be great: and, moreover, that there is a particular method of handling which
none but consummate artists reach, which has its effects at the intended distance, and is altogether
hieroglyphical and unintelligible at any other. This, I say, is acknowledged in painting, but
it is not practically acknowledged in architecture; nor until my attention was especially directed
to it, had I myself any idea of the care with which this great question was studied by the
mediæval architects. On my first careful examination of the capitals of the upper arcade of
the Ducal Palace at Venice, I was induced, by their singular inferiority of workmanship, to
suppose them posterior to those of the lower arcade. It was not till I discovered that some
of those which I thought the worst above, were the best when seen from below, that I obtained
the key to this marvellous system of adaptation; a system which I afterwards found carried
out in every building of the great times which I had opportunity of examining.

§ XVI. There are two distinct modes in which this adaptation is effected. In the first, the
same designs which are delicately worked when near the eye, are rudely cut, and have far fewer
details when they are removed from it. In this method it is not always easy to distinguish
economy from skill, or slovenliness from science. But, in the second method, a different design
is adopted, composed of fewer parts and of simpler lines, and this is cut with exquisite precision.
This is of course the higher method, and the more satisfactory proof of purpose; but an equal
degree of imperfection is found in both kinds when they are seen close; in the first, a bald
execution of a perfect design; the second, a baldness of design with perfect execution. And
in these very imperfections lies the admirableness of the ornament.

§ XVII. It may be asked whether, in advocating this adaptation to the distance of the eye,
I obey my adopted rule of observance of natural law. Are not all natural things, it may be
asked, as lovely near as far away? Nay, not so. Look at the clouds, and watch the delicate
sculpture of their alabaster sides, and the rounded lustre of their magnificent rolling. They
are meant to be beheld far away; they were shaped for their place, high above your head; approach
them, and they fuse into vague mists, or whirl away in fierce fragments of thunderous vapor.
Look at the crest of the Alp, from the far-away plains over which its light is cast, whence
human souls have communion with it by their myriads. The child looks up to it in the dawn,
and the husbandman in the burden and heat of the day, and the old man in the going down of
the sun, and it is to them all as the celestial city on the world's horizon; dyed with the
depth of heaven, and clothed with the calm of eternity. There was it set, for holy dominion,
by Him who marked for the sun his journey, and bade the moon know her going down. It was built
for its place in the far-off sky; approach it, and as the sound of the voice of man dies away
about its foundations, and the tide of human life, shallowed upon the vast aërial shore, is
at last met by the Eternal "Here shall thy waves be stayed," the glory of its aspect fades
into blanched fearfulness; its purple walls are rent into grisly rocks, its silver fretwork
saddened into wasting snow, the storm-brands of ages are on its breast, the ashes of its own
ruin lie solemnly on its white raiment.

Nor in such instances as these alone, though strangely enough, the discrepancy between apparent
and actual beauty is greater in proportion to the unapproachableness of the object, is the
law observed. For every distance from the eye there is a peculiar kind of beauty, or a different
system of lines of form; the sight of that beauty is reserved for that distance, and for that
alone. If you approach nearer, that kind of beauty is lost, and another succeeds, to be disorganised
and reduced to strange and incomprehensible means and appliances in its turn. If you desire
to perceive the great harmonies of the form of a rocky mountain, you must not ascend upon its
sides. All is there disorder and accident, or seems so; sudden starts of its shattered beds
hither and thither; ugly struggles of unexpected strength from under the ground; fallen fragments,
toppling one over another into more helpless fall. Retire from it, and, as your eye commands
it more and more, as you see the ruined mountain world with a wider glance, behold! dim sympathies
begin to busy themselves in the disjointed mass; line binds itself into stealthy fellowship
with line; group by group, the helpless fragments gather themselves into ordered companies;
new captains of hosts and masses of battalions become visible, one by one, and far away answers
of foot to foot, and of bone to bone, until the powerless chaos is seen risen up with girded
loins, and not one piece of all the unregarded heap could now be spared from the mystic whole.

§ XVIII. Now it is indeed true that where nature loses one kind of beauty, as you approach
it, she substitutes another; this is worthy of her infinite power: and, as we shall see, art
can sometimes follow her even in doing this; but all I insist upon at present is, that the
several effects of nature are each worked with means referred to a particular distance, and
producing their effect at that distance only. Take a singular and marked instance: When the
sun rises behind a ridge of pines, and those pines are seen from a distance of a mile or two,
against his light, the whole form of the tree, trunk, branches, and all, becomes one frostwork
of intensely brilliant silver, which is relieved against the clear sky like a burning fringe,
for some distance on either side of the sun.[71] Now suppose that a person who had never seen
pines were, for the first time in his life, to see them under this strange aspect, and, reasoning
as to the means by which such effect could be produced, laboriously to approach the eastern
ridge, how would he be amazed to find that the fiery spectres had been produced by trees with
swarthy and grey trunks, and dark green leaves! We, in our simplicity, if we had been required
to produce such an appearance, should have built up trees of chased silver, with trunks of
glass, and then been grievously amazed to find that, at two miles off, neither silver nor glass
were any more visible; but nature knew better, and prepared for her fairy work with the strong
branches and dark leaves, in her own mysterious way.

§ XIX. Now this is exactly what you have to do with your good ornament. It may be that it is
capable of being approached, as well as likely to be seen far away, and then it ought to have
microscopic qualities, as the pine leaves have, which will bear approach. But your calculation
of its purpose is for a glory to be produced at a given distance; it may be here, or may be
there, but it is a given distance; and the excellence of the ornament depends upon its fitting
that distance, and being seen better there than anywhere else, and having a particular function
and form which it can only discharge and assume there. You are never to say that ornament has
great merit because "you cannot see the beauty of it here;" but, it has great merit because
"you can see its beauty here only." And to give it this merit is just about as difficult a
task as I could well set you. I have above noted the two ways in which it is done: the one,
being merely rough cutting, may be passed over; the other, which is scientific alteration of
design, falls, itself, into two great branches, Simplification and Emphasis.

A word or two is necessary on each of these heads.

§ XX. When an ornamental work is intended to be seen near, if its composition be indeed fine,
the subdued and delicate portions of the design lead to, and unite, the energetic parts, and
those energetic parts form with the rest a whole, in which their own immediate relations to
each other are not perceived. Remove this design to a distance, and the connecting delicacies
vanish, the energies alone remain, now either disconnected altogether, or assuming with each
other new relations, which, not having been intended by the designer, will probably be painful.
There is a like, and a more palpable, effect, in the retirement of a band of music in which
the instruments are of very unequal powers; the fluting and fifeing expire, the drumming remains,
and that in a painful arrangement, as demanding something which is unheard. In like manner,
as the designer at arm's length removes or elevates his work, fine gradations, and roundings,
and incidents, vanish, and a totally unexpected arrangement is established between the remainder
of the markings, certainly confused, and in all probability painful.

§ XXI. The art of architectural design is therefore, first, the preparation for this beforehand,
the rejection of all the delicate passages as worse than useless, and the fixing the thought
upon the arrangement of the features which will remain visible far away. Nor does this always
imply a diminution of resource; for, while it may be assumed as a law that fine modulation
of surface in light becomes quickly invisible as the object retires, there are a softness and
mystery given to the harder markings, which enable them to be safely used as media of expression.
There is an exquisite example of this use, in the head of the Adam of the Ducal Palace. It
is only at the height of 17 or 18 feet above the eye; nevertheless, the sculptor felt it was
no use to trouble himself about drawing the corners of the mouth, or the lines of the lips,
delicately, at that distance; his object has been to mark them clearly, and to prevent accidental
shadows from concealing them, or altering their expression. The lips are cut thin and sharp,
so that their line cannot be mistaken, and a good deep drill-hole struck into the angle of
the mouth; the eye is anxious and questioning, and one is surprised, from below, to perceive
a kind of darkness in the iris of it, neither like color, nor like a circular furrow. The expedient
can only be discovered by ascending to the level of the head; it is one which would have been
quite inadmissible except in distant work, six drill-holes cut into the iris, round a central
one for the pupil.

§ XXII. By just calculation, like this, of the means at our disposal, by beautiful arrangement
of the prominent features, and by choice of different subjects for different places, choosing
the broadest forms for the farthest distance, it is possible to give the impression, not only
of perfection, but of an exquisite delicacy, to the most distant ornament. And this is the
true sign of the right having been done, and the utmost possible power attained:--The spectator
should be satisfied to stay in his place, feeling the decoration, wherever it may be, equally
rich, full, and lovely: not desiring to climb the steeples in order to examine it, but sure
that he has it all, where he is. Perhaps the capitals of the cathedral of Genoa are the best
instances of absolute perfection in this kind: seen from below, they appear as rich as the
frosted silver of the Strada degli Orefici; and the nearer you approach them, the less delicate
they seem.

§ XXIII. This is, however, not the only mode, though the best, in which ornament is adapted
for distance. The other is emphasis,--the unnatural insisting upon explanatory lines, where
the subject would otherwise become unintelligible. It is to be remembered that, by a deep and
narrow incision, an architect has the power, at least in sunshine, of drawing a black line
on stone, just as vigorously as it can be drawn with chalk on grey paper; and that he may thus,
wherever and in the degree that he chooses, substitute chalk sketching for sculpture. They
are curiously mingled by the Romans. The bas-reliefs of the Arc d'Orange are small, and would
be confused, though in bold relief, if they depended for intelligibility on the relief only;
but each figure is outlined by a strong incision at its edge into the background, and all the
ornaments on the armor are simply drawn with incised lines, and not cut out at all. A similar
use of lines is made by the Gothic nations in all their early sculpture, and with delicious
effect. Now, to draw a mere pattern--as, for instance, the bearings of a shield--with these
simple incisions, would, I suppose, occupy an able sculptor twenty minutes or half an hour;
and the pattern is then clearly seen, under all circumstances of light and shade; there can
be no mistake about it, and no missing it. To carve out the bearings in due and finished relief
would occupy a long summer's day, and the results would be feeble and indecipherable in the
best lights, and in some lights totally and hopelessly invisible, ignored, non-existant. Now
the Renaissance architects, and our modern ones, despise the simple expedient of the rough
Roman or barbarian. They do not care to be understood. They care only to speak finely, and
be thought great orators, if one could only hear them. So I leave you to choose between the
old men, who took minutes to tell things plainly, and the modern men, who take days to tell
them unintelligibly.

§ XXIV. All expedients of this kind, both of simplification and energy, for the expression
of details at a distance where their actual forms would have been invisible, but more especially
this linear method, I shall call Proutism; for the greatest master of the art in modern times
has been Samuel Prout. He actually takes up buildings of the later times in which the ornament
has been too refined for its place, and translates it into the energised linear ornament of
earlier art: and to this power of taking the life and essence of decoration, and putting it
into a perfectly intelligible form, when its own fulness would have been confused, is owing
the especial power of his drawings. Nothing can be more closely analogous than the method with
which an old Lombard uses his chisel, and that with which Prout uses the reed-pen; and we shall
see presently farther correspondence in their feeling about the enrichment of luminous surfaces.

§ XXV. Now, all that has been hitherto said refers to ornament whose distance is fixed, or
nearly so; as when it is at any considerable height from the ground, supposing the spectator
to desire to see it, and to get as near it as he can. But the distance of ornament is never
fixed to the general spectator. The tower of a cathedral is bound to look well, ten miles off,
or five miles, or half a mile, or within fifty yards. The ornaments of its top have fixed distances,
compared with those of its base; but quite unfixed distances in their relation to the great
world: and the ornaments of the base have no fixed distance at all. They are bound to look
well from the other side of the cathedral close, and to look equally well, or better, as we
enter the cathedral door. How are we to manage this?

§ XXVI. As nature manages it. I said above, § XVII., that for every distance from the eye there
was a different system of form in all natural objects: this is to be so then in architecture.
The lesser ornament is to be grafted on the greater, and third or fourth orders of ornaments
upon this again, as need may be, until we reach the limits of possible sight; each order of
ornament being adapted for a different distance: first, for example, the great masses,--the
buttresses and stories and black windows and broad cornices of the tower, which give it make,
and organism, as it rises over the horizon, half a score of miles away: then the traceries
and shafts and pinnacles, which give it richness as we approach: then the niches and statues
and knobs and flowers, which we can only see when we stand beneath it. At this third order
of ornament, we may pause, in the upper portions; but on the roofs of the niches, and the robes
of the statues, and the rolls of the mouldings, comes a fourth order of ornament, as delicate
as the eye can follow, when any of these features may be approached.

§ XXVII. All good ornamentation is thus arborescent, as it were, one class of it branching
out of another and sustained by it; and its nobility consists in this, that whatever order
or class of it we may be contemplating, we shall find it subordinated to a greater, simpler,
and more powerful; and if we then contemplate the greater order, we shall find it again subordinated
to a greater still; until the greatest can only be quite grasped by retiring to the limits
of distance commanding it.

And if this subordination be not complete, the ornament is bad: if the figurings and chasings
and borderings of a dress be not subordinated to the folds of it,--if the folds are not subordinate
to the action and mass of the figure,--if this action and mass not to the divisions of the
recesses and shafts among which it stands,--if these not to the shadows of the great arches
and buttresses of the whole building, in each case there is error; much more if all be contending
with each other and striving for attention at the same time.

§ XXVIII. It is nevertheless evident, that, however perfect this distribution, there cannot
be orders adapted to every distance of the spectator. Between the ranks of ornament there must
always be a bold separation; and there must be many intermediate distances, where we are too
far off to see the lesser rank clearly, and yet too near to grasp the next higher rank wholly:
and at all these distances the spectator will feel himself ill-placed, and will desire to go
nearer or farther away. This must be the case in all noble work, natural or artificial. It
is exactly the same with respect to Rouen cathedral or the Mont Blanc. We like to see them
from the other side of the Seine, or of the lake of Geneva; from the Marché aux Fleurs, or
the Valley of Chamouni; from the parapets of the apse, or the crags of the Montagne de la Côte:
but there are intermediate distances which dissatisfy us in either case, and from which one
is in haste either to advance or to retire.

§ XXIX. Directly opposed to this ordered, disciplined, well officered and variously ranked
ornament, this type of divine, and therefore of all good human government, is the democratic
ornament, in which all is equally influential, and has equal office and authority; that is
to say, none of it any office nor authority, but a life of continual struggle for independence
and notoriety, or of gambling for chance regards. The English perpendicular work is by far
the worst of this kind that I know; its main idea, or decimal fraction of an idea, being to
cover its walls with dull, successive, eternity of reticulation, to fill with equal foils the
equal interstices between the equal bars, and charge the interminable blanks with statues and
rosettes, invisible at a distance, and uninteresting near.

The early Lombardic, Veronese, and Norman work is the exact reverse of this; being divided
first into large masses, and these masses covered with minute chasing and surface work, which
fill them with interest, and yet do not disturb nor divide their greatness. The lights are
kept broad and bright, and yet are found on near approach to be charged with intricate design.
This, again, is a part of the great system of treatment which I shall hereafter call "Proutism;"
much of what is thought mannerism and imperfection in Prout's work, being the result of his
determined resolution that minor details shall never break up his large masses of light.

§ XXX. Such are the main principles to be observed in the adaptation of ornament to the sight.
We have lastly to inquire by what method, and in what quantities, the ornament, thus adapted
to mental contemplation, and prepared for its physical position, may most wisely be arranged.
I think the method ought first to be considered, and the quantity last; for the advisable quantity
depends upon the method.

§ XXXI. It was said above, that the proper treatment or arrangement of ornament was that which
expressed the laws and ways of Deity. Now, the subordination of visible orders to each other,
just noted, is one expression of these. But there may also--must also--be a subordination and
obedience of the parts of each order to some visible law, out of itself, but having reference
to itself only (not to any upper order): some law which shall not oppress, but guide, limit,
and sustain.

In the tenth chapter of the second volume of "Modern Painters," the reader will find that I
traced one part of the beauty of God's creation to the expression of a self-restrained liberty:
that is to say, the image of that perfection of divine action, which, though free to work in
arbitrary methods, works always in consistent methods, called by us Laws.

Now, correspondingly, we find that when these natural objects are to become subjects of the
art of man, their perfect treatment is an image of the perfection of human action: a voluntary
submission to divine law.

It was suggested to me but lately by the friend to whose originality of thought I have before
expressed my obligations, Mr. Newton, that the Greek pediment, with its enclosed sculptures,
represented to the Greek mind the law of Fate, confining human action within limits not to
be overpassed. I do not believe the Greeks ever distinctly thought of this; but the instinct
of all the human race, since the world began, agrees in some expression of such limitation
as one of the first necessities of good ornament.[72] And this expression is heightened, rather
than diminished, when some portion of the design slightly breaks the law to which the rest
is subjected; it is like expressing the use of miracles in the divine government; or, perhaps,
in slighter degrees, the relaxing of a law, generally imperative, in compliance with some more
imperative need--the hungering of David. How eagerly this special infringement of a general
law was sometimes sought by the mediæval workmen, I shall be frequently able to point out to
the reader; but I remember just now a most curious instance, in an archivolt of a house in
the Corte del Remer close to the Rialto at Venice. It is composed of a wreath of flower-work--a
constant Byzantine design--with an animal in each coil; the whole enclosed between two fillets.
Each animal, leaping or eating, scratching or biting, is kept nevertheless strictly within
its coil, and between the fillets. Not the shake of an ear, not the tip of a tail, overpasses
this appointed line, through a series of some five-and-twenty or thirty animals; until, on
a sudden, and by mutual consent, two little beasts (not looking, for the rest, more rampant
than the others), one on each side, lay their small paws across the enclosing fillet at exactly
the same point of its course, and thus break the continuity of its line. Two ears of corn,
or leaves, do the same thing in the mouldings round the northern door of the Baptistery at
Florence.

§ XXXII. Observe, however, and this is of the utmost possible importance, that the value of
this type does not consist in the mere shutting of the ornament into a certain space, but in
the acknowledgment by the ornament of the fitness of the limitation--of its own perfect willingness
to submit to it; nay, of a predisposition in itself to fall into the ordained form, without
any direct expression of the command to do so; an anticipation of the authority, and an instant
and willing submission to it, in every fibre and spray: not merely willing, but happy submission,
as being pleased rather than vexed to have so beautiful a law suggested to it, and one which
to follow is so justly in accordance with its own nature. You must not cut out a branch of
hawthorn as it grows, and rule a triangle round it, and suppose that it is then submitted to
law. Not a bit of it. It is only put in a cage, and will look as if it must get out, for its
life, or wither in the confinement. But the spirit of triangle must be put into the hawthorn.
It must suck in isoscelesism with its sap. Thorn and blossom, leaf and spray, must grow with
an awful sense of triangular necessity upon them, for the guidance of which they are to be
thankful, and to grow all the stronger and more gloriously. And though there may be a transgression
here and there, and an adaptation to some other need, or a reaching forth to some other end
greater even than the triangle, yet this liberty is to be always accepted under a solemn sense
of special permission; and when the full form is reached and the entire submission expressed,
and every blossom has a thrilling sense of its responsibility down into its tiniest stamen,
you may take your terminal line away if you will. No need for it any more. The commandment
is written on the heart of the thing.

§ XXXIII. Then, besides this obedience to external law, there is the obedience to internal
headship, which constitutes the unity of ornament, of which I think enough has been said for
my present purpose in the chapter on Unity in the second vol. of "Modern Painters." But I hardly
know whether to arrange as an expression of a divine law, or a representation of a physical
fact, the alternation of shade with light which, in equal succession, forms one of the chief
elements of continuous ornament, and in some peculiar ones, such as dentils and billet mouldings,
is the source of their only charm. The opposition of good and evil, the antagonism of the entire
human system (so ably worked out by Lord Lindsay), the alternation of labor with rest, the
mingling of life with death, or the actual physical fact of the division of light from darkness,
and of the falling and rising of night and day, are all typified or represented by these chains
of shade and light of which the eye never wearies, though their true meaning may never occur
to the thoughts.

§ XXXIV. The next question respecting the arrangement of ornament is one closely connected
also with its quantity. The system of creation is one in which "God's creatures leap not, but
express a feast, where all the guests sit close, and nothing wants." It is also a feast, where
there is nothing redundant. So, then, in distributing our ornament, there must never be any
sense of gap or blank, neither any sense of there being a single member, or fragment of a member,
which could be spared. Whatever has nothing to do, whatever could go without being missed,
is not ornament; it is deformity and encumbrance. Away with it. And, on the other hand, care
must be taken either to diffuse the ornament which we permit, in due relation over the whole
building, or so to concentrate it, as never to leave a sense of its having got into knots,
and curdled upon some points, and left the rest of the building whey. It is very difficult
to give the rules, or analyse the feelings, which should direct us in this matter: for some
shafts may be carved and others left unfinished, and that with advantage; some windows may
be jewelled like Aladdin's, and one left plain, and still with advantage; the door or doors,
or a single turret, or the whole western façade of a church, or the apse or transept, may be
made special subjects of decoration, and the rest left plain, and still sometimes with advantage.
But in all such cases there is either sign of that feeling which I advocated in the First Chapter
of the "Seven Lamps," the desire of rather doing some portion of the building as we would have
it, and leaving the rest plain, than doing the whole imperfectly; or else there is choice made
of some important feature, to which, as more honorable than the rest, the decoration is confined.
The evil is when, without system, and without preference of the nobler members, the ornament
alternates between sickly luxuriance and sudden blankness. In many of our Scotch and English
abbeys, especially Melrose, this is painfully felt; but the worst instance I have ever seen
is the window in the side of the arch under the Wellington statue, next St. George's Hospital.
In the first place, a window has no business there at all; in the second, the bars of the window
are not the proper place for decoration, especially wavy decoration, which one instantly fancies
of cast iron; in the third, the richness of the ornament is a mere patch and eruption upon
the wall, and one hardly knows whether to be most irritated at the affectation of severity
in the rest, or at the vain luxuriance of the dissolute parallelogram.

§ XXXV. Finally, as regards quantity of ornament I have already said, again and again, you
cannot have too much if it be good; that is, if it be thoroughly united and harmonised by the
laws hitherto insisted upon. But you may easily have too much if you have more than you have
sense to manage. For with every added order of ornament increases the difficulty of discipline.
It is exactly the same as in war: you cannot, as an abstract law, have too many soldiers, but
you may easily have more than the country is able to sustain, or than your generalship is competent
to command. And every regiment which you cannot manage will, on the day of battle, be in your
way, and encumber the movements it is not in disposition to sustain.

§ XXXVI. As an architect, therefore, you are modestly to measure your capacity of governing
ornament. Remember, its essence,--its being ornament at all, consists in its being governed.
Lose your authority over it, let it command you, or lead you, or dictate to you in any wise,
and it is an offence, an incumbrance, and a dishonor. And it is always ready to do this; wild
to get the bit in its teeth, and rush forth on its own devices. Measure, therefore, your strength;
and as long as there is no chance of mutiny, add soldier to soldier, battalion to battalion;
but be assured that all are heartily in the cause, and that there is not one of whose position
you are ignorant, or whose service you could spare.

    think, however, the writer attaches too great importance to one out
    of many ornamental necessities.

CHAPTER XXII.

  THE ANGLE.

§ I. We have now examined the treatment and specific kinds of ornament at our command. We have
lastly to note the fittest places for their disposal. Not but that all kinds of ornament are
used in all places; but there are some parts of the building, which, without ornament, are
more painful than others, and some which wear ornament more gracefully than others; so that,
although an able architect will always be finding out some new and unexpected modes of decoration,
and fitting his ornament into wonderful places where it is least expected, there are, nevertheless,
one or two general laws which may be noted respecting every one of the parts of a building,
laws not (except a few) imperative like those of construction, but yet generally expedient,
and good to be understood, if it were only that we might enjoy the brilliant methods in which
they are sometimes broken. I shall note, however, only a few of the simplest; to trace them
into their ramifications, and class in due order the known or possible methods of decoration
for each part of a building, would alone require a large volume, and be, I think, a somewhat
useless work; for there is often a high pleasure in the very unexpectedness of the ornament,
which would be destroyed by too elaborate an arrangement of its kinds.

§ II. I think that the reader must, by this time, so thoroughly understand the connection of
the parts of a building, that I may class together, in treating of decoration, several parts
which I kept separate in speaking of construction. Thus I shall put under one head (A) the
base of the wall and of the shaft; then (B) the wall veil and shaft itself; then (C) the cornice
and capital; then (D) the jamb and archivolt, including the arches both over shafts and apertures,
and the jambs of apertures, which are closely connected with their archivolts; finally (E)
the roof, including the real roof, and the minor roofs or gables of pinnacles and arches. I
think, under these divisions, all may be arranged which is necessary to be generally stated;
for tracery decorations or aperture fillings are but smaller forms of application of the arch,
and the cusps are merely smaller spandrils, while buttresses have, as far as I know, no specific
ornament. The best are those which have least; and the little they have resolves itself into
pinnacles, which are common to other portions of the building, or into small shafts, arches,
and niches, of still more general applicability. We shall therefore have only five divisions
to examine in succession, from foundation to roof.

§ III. But in the decoration of these several parts, certain minor conditions of ornament occur
which are of perfectly general application. For instance, whether, in archivolts, jambs, or
buttresses, or in square piers, or at the extremity of the entire building, we necessarily
have the awkward (moral or architectural) feature, the corner. How to turn a corner gracefully
becomes, therefore, a perfectly general question; to be examined without reference to any particular
part of the edifice.

§ IV. Again, the furrows and ridges by which bars of parallel light and shade are obtained,
whether these are employed in arches, or jambs, or bases, or cornices, must of necessity present
one or more of six forms: square projection, a (Fig. LI.), or square recess, b, sharp projection,
c, or sharp recess, d, curved projection, e, or curved recess, f. What odd curves the projection
or recess may assume, or how these different conditions may be mixed and run into one another,
is not our present business. We note only the six distinct kinds or types.

Now, when these ridges or furrows are on a small scale they often themselves constitute all
the ornament required for larger features, and are left smooth cut; but on a very large scale
they are apt to become insipid, and they require a sub-ornament of their own, the consideration
of which is, of course, in great part, general, and irrespective of the place held by the mouldings
in the building itself: which consideration I think we had better undertake first of all.

§ V. But before we come to particular examination of these minor forms, let us see how far
we can simplify it. Look back to Fig. LI., above. There are distinguished in it six forms of
moulding. Of these, c is nothing but a small corner; but, for convenience sake, it is better
to call it an edge, and to consider its decoration together with that of the member a, which
is called a fillet; while e, which I shall call a roll (because I do not choose to assume that
it shall be only of the semicircular section here given), is also best considered together
with its relative recess, f; and because the shape of a recess is of no great consequence,
I shall class all the three recesses together, and we shall thus have only three subjects for
separate consideration:--

  1. The Angle.
  2. The Edge and Fillet.
  3. The Roll and Recess.

§ VI. There are two other general forms which may probably occur to the reader's mind, namely,
the ridge (as of a roof), which is a corner laid on its back, or sloping,--a supine corner,
decorated in a very different manner from a stiff upright corner: and the point, which is a
concentrated corner, and has wonderfully elaborate decorations all to its insignificant self,
finials, and spikes, and I know not what more. But both these conditions are so closely connected
with roofs (even the cusp finial being a kind of pendant to a small roof), that I think it
better to class them and their ornament under the head of roof decoration, together with the
whole tribe of crockets and bosses; so that we shall be here concerned only with the three
subjects above distinguished: and, first, the corner or Angle.

§ VII. The mathematician knows there are many kinds of angles; but the one we have principally
to deal with now, is that which the reader may very easily conceive as the corner of a square
house, or square anything. It is of course the one of most frequent occurrence; and its treatment,
once understood, may, with slight modification, be referred to other corners, sharper or blunter,
or with curved sides.

§ VIII. Evidently the first and roughest idea which would occur to any one who found a corner
troublesome, would be to cut it off. This is a very summary and tyrannical proceeding, somewhat
barbarous, yet advisable if nothing else can be done: an amputated corner is said to be chamfered.
It can, however, evidently be cut off in three ways: 1. with a concave cut, a; 2. with a straight
cut, b; 3. with a convex cut, c, Fig. LII.

The first two methods, the most violent and summary, have the apparent disadvantage that we
get by them,--two corners instead of one; much milder corners, however, and with a different
light and shade between them; so that both methods are often very expedient. You may see the
straight chamfer (b) on most lamp posts, and pillars at railway stations, it being the easiest
to cut: the concave chamfer requires more care, and occurs generally in well-finished but simple
architecture--very beautifully in the small arches of the Broletto of Como, Plate V.; and the
straight chamfer in architecture of every kind, very constantly in Norman cornices and arches,
as in Fig. 2, Plate IV., at Sens.

§ IX. The third, or convex chamfer, as it is the gentlest mode of treatment, so (as in medicine
and morals) it is very generally the best. For while the two other methods produce two corners
instead of one, this gentle chamfer does verily get rid of the corner altogether, and substitutes
a soft curve in its place.

But it has, in the form above given, this grave disadvantage, that it looks as if the corner
had been rubbed or worn off, blunted by time and weather, and in want of sharpening again.
A great deal often depends, and in such a case as this, everything depends, on the Voluntariness
of the ornament. The work of time is beautiful on surfaces, but not on edges intended to be
sharp. Even if we needed them blunt, we should not like them blunt on compulsion; so, to show
that the bluntness is our own ordaining, we will put a slight incised line to mark off the
rounding, and show that it goes no farther than we choose. We shall thus have the section a,
Fig. LIII.; and this mode of turning an angle is one of the very best ever invented. By enlarging
and deepening the incision, we get in succession the forms b, c, d; and by describing a small
equal arc on each of the sloping lines of these figures, we get e, f, g, h.

§ X. I do not know whether these mouldings are called by architects chamfers or beads; but
I think bead a bad word for a continuous moulding, and the proper sense of the word chamfer
is fixed by Spenser as descriptive not merely of truncation, but of trench or furrow:--

  "Tho gin you, fond flies, the cold to scorn,
   And, crowing in pipes made of green corn,
   You thinken to be lords of the year;
   But eft when ye count you freed from fear,
   Comes the breme winter with chamfred brows,
   Full of wrinkles and frosty furrows."

So I shall call the above mouldings beaded chamfers, when there is any chance of confusion
with the plain chamfer, a, or b, of Fig. LII.: and when there is no such chance, I shall use
the word chamfer only.

§ XI. Of those above given, b is the constant chamfer of Venice, and a of Verona: a being the
grandest and best, and having a peculiar precision and quaintness of effect about it. I found
it twice in Venice, used on the sharp angle, as at a and b, Fig. LIV., a being from the angle
of a house on the Rio San Zulian, and b from the windows of the church of San Stefano.

§ XII. There is, however, evidently another variety of the chamfers, f and g, Fig. LIII., formed
by an unbroken curve instead of two curves, as c, Fig. LIV.; and when this, or the chamfer
d, Fig. LIII., is large, it is impossible to say whether they have been devised from the incised
angle, or from small shafts set in a nook, as at e, Fig. LIV., or in the hollow of the curved
chamfer, as d, Fig. LIV. In general, however, the shallow chamfers, a, b, e, and f, Fig. LIII.,
are peculiar to southern work; and may be assumed to have been derived from the incised angle,
while the deep chamfers, c, d, g, h, are characteristic of northern work, and may be partly
derived or imitated from the angle shaft; while, with the usual extravagance of the northern
architects, they are cut deeper and deeper until we arrive at the condition f, Fig. LIV., which
is the favorite chamfer at Bourges and Bayeux, and in other good French work.

I have placed in the Appendix[73] a figure belonging to this subject, but which cannot interest
the general reader, showing the number of possible chamfers with a roll moulding of given size.

§ XIII. If we take the plain chamfer, b, of Fig. LII., on a large scale, as at a, Fig. LV.,
and bead both its edges, cutting away the parts there shaded, we shall have a form much used
in richly decorated Gothic, both in England and Italy. It might be more simply described as
the chamfer a of Fig. LII., with an incision on each edge; but the part here shaded is often
worked into ornamental forms, not being entirely cut away.

§ XIV. Many other mouldings, which at first sight appear very elaborate, are nothing more than
a chamfer, with a series of small echoes of it on each side, dying away with a ripple on the
surface of the wall, as in b, Fig. LV., from Coutances (observe, here the white part is the
solid stone, the shade is cut away).

Chamfers of this kind are used on a small scale and in delicate work: the coarse chamfers are
found on all scales: f and g, Fig. LIII., in Venice, form the great angles of almost every
Gothic palace; the roll being a foot or a foot and a half round, and treated as a shaft, with
a capital and fresh base at every story, while the stones of which it is composed form alternate
quoins in the brickwork beyond the chamfer curve. I need hardly say how much nobler this arrangement
is than a common quoined angle; it gives a finish to the aspect of the whole pile attainable
in no other way. And thus much may serve concerning angle decoration by chamfer.

CHAPTER XXIII.

  THE EDGE AND FILLET.

§ I. The decoration of the angle by various forms of chamfer and bead, as above described,
is the quietest method we can employ; too quiet, when great energy is to be given to the moulding,
and impossible, when, instead of a bold angle, we have to deal with a small projecting edge,
like c in Fig. LI. In such cases we may employ a decoration, far ruder and easier in its simplest
conditions than the bead, far more effective when not used in too great profusion; and of which
the complete developments are the source of mouldings at once the most picturesque and most
serviceable which the Gothic builders invented.

§ II. The gunwales of the Venetian heavy barges being liable to somewhat rough collision with
each other, and with the walls of the streets, are generally protected by a piece of timber,
which projects in the form of the fillet, a, Fig. LI.; but which, like all other fillets, may,
if we so choose, be considered as composed of two angles or edges, which the natural and most
wholesome love of the Venetian boatmen for ornament, otherwise strikingly evidenced by their
painted sails and glittering flag-vanes, will not suffer to remain wholly undecorated. The
rough service of these timbers, however, will not admit of rich ornament, and the boatbuilder
usually contents himself with cutting a series of notches in each edge, one series alternating
with the other, as represented at 1, Plate IX.

§ III. In that simple ornament, not as confined to Venetian boats, but as representative of
a general human instinct to hack at an edge, demonstrated by all school-boys and all idle possessors
of penknives or other cutting instruments on both sides of the Atlantic;--in that rude Venetian
gunwale, I say, is the germ of all the ornament which has touched, with its rich successions
of angular shadow, the portals and archivolts of nearly every early building of importance,
from the North Cape to the Straits of Messina. Nor are the modifications of the first suggestion
intricate. All that is generic in their character may be seen on Plate IX. at a glance.

§ IV. Taking a piece of stone instead of timber, and enlarging the notches, until they meet
each other, we have the condition 2, which is a moulding from the tomb of the Doge Andrea Dandolo,
in St. Mark's. Now, considering this moulding as composed of two decorated edges, each edge
will be reduced, by the meeting of the notches, to a series of four-sided pyramids (as marked
off by the dotted lines), which, the notches here being shallow, will be shallow pyramids;
but by deepening the notches, we get them as at 3, with a profile a, more or less steep. This
moulding I shall always call "the plain dogtooth;" it is used in profusion in the Venetian
and Veronese Gothic, generally set with its front to the spectator, as here at 3; but its effect
may be much varied by placing it obliquely (4, and profile as at b); or with one side horizontal
(5, and profile c). Of these three conditions, 3 and 5 are exactly the same in reality, only
differently placed; but in 4 the pyramid is obtuse, and the inclination of its base variable,
the upper side of it being always kept vertical. It is comparatively rare. Of the three, the
last, 5, is far the most brilliant in effect, giving in the distance a zigzag form to the high
light on it, and a full sharp shadow below. The use of this shadow is sufficiently seen by
fig. 7 in this plate (the arch on the left, the number beneath it), in which these levelled
dogteeth, with a small interval between each, are employed to set off by their vigor the delicacy
of floral ornament above. This arch is the side of a niche from the tomb of Can Signorio della
Scala, at Verona; and the value, as well as the distant expression of its dogtooth, may be
seen by referring to Prout's beautiful drawing of this tomb in his "Sketches in France and
Italy." I have before observed that this artist never fails of seizing the true and leading
expression of whatever he touches: he has made this ornament the leading feature of the niche,
expressing it, as in distance it is only expressible, by a zigzag.

§ V. The reader may perhaps be surprised at my speaking so highly of this drawing, if he take
the pains to compare Prout's symbolism of the work on the niche with the facts as they stand
here in Plate IX. But the truth is that Prout has rendered the effect of the monument on the
mind of the passer-by;--the effect it was intended to have on every man who turned the corner
of the street beneath it: and in this sense there is actually more truth and likeness[74] in
Prout's translation than in my fac-simile, made diligently by peering into the details from
a ladder. I do not say that all the symbolism in Prout's Sketch is the best possible; but it
is the best which any architectural draughtsman has yet invented; and in its application to
special subjects it always shows curious internal evidence that the sketch has been made on
the spot, and that the artist tried to draw what he saw, not to invent an attractive subject.
I shall notice other instances of this hereafter.

§ VI. The dogtooth, employed in this simple form, is, however, rather a foil for other ornament,
than itself a satisfactory or generally available decoration. It is, however, easy to enrich
it as we choose: taking up its simple form at 3, and describing the arcs marked by the dotted
lines upon its sides, and cutting a small triangular cavity between them, we shall leave its
ridges somewhat rudely representative of four leaves, as at 8, which is the section and front
view of one of the Venetian stone cornices described above, Chap. XIV., § IV., the figure 8
being here put in the hollow of the gutter. The dogtooth is put on the outer lower truncation,
and is actually in position as fig. 5; but being always looked up to, is to the spectator as
3, and always rich and effective. The dogteeth are perhaps most frequently expanded to the
width of fig. 9.

§ VII. As in nearly all other ornaments previously described, so in this,--we have only to
deepen the Italian cutting, and we shall get the Northern type. If we make the original pyramid
somewhat steeper, and instead of lightly incising, cut it through, so as to have the leaves
held only by their points to the base, we shall have the English dogtooth; somewhat vulgar
in its piquancy, when compared with French mouldings of a similar kind.[75] It occurs, I think,
on one house in Venice, in the Campo St. Polo; but the ordinary moulding, with light incisions,
is frequent in archivolts and architraves, as well as in the roof cornices.

§ VIII. This being the simplest treatment of the pyramid, fig. 10, from the refectory of Wenlock
Abbey, is an example of the simplest decoration of the recesses or inward angles between the
pyramids; that is to say, of a simple hacked edge like one of those in fig. 2, the cuts being
taken up and decorated instead of the points. Each is worked into a small trefoiled arch, with
an incision round it to mark its outline, and another slight incision above, expressing the
angle of the first cutting. I said that the teeth in fig. 7 had in distance the effect of a
zigzag: in fig. 10 this zigzag effect is seized upon and developed, but with the easiest and
roughest work; the angular incision being a mere limiting line, like that described in § IX.
of the last chapter. But hence the farther steps to every condition of Norman ornament are
self evident. I do not say that all of them arose from development of the dogtooth in this
manner, many being quite independent inventions and uses of zigzag lines; still, they may all
be referred to this simple type as their root and representative, that is to say, the mere
hack of the Venetian gunwale, with a limiting line following the resultant zigzag.

§ IX. Fig. 11 is a singular and much more artificial condition, cast in brick, from the church
of the Frari, and given here only for future reference. Fig. 12, resulting from a fillet with
the cuts on each of its edges interrupted by a bar, is a frequent Venetian moulding, and of
great value; but the plain or leaved dogteeth have been the favorites, and that to such a degree,
that even the Renaissance architects took them up; and the best bit of Renaissance design in
Venice, the side of the Ducal Palace next the Bridge of Sighs, owes great part of its splendor
to its foundation, faced with large flat dogteeth, each about a foot wide in the base, with
their points truncated, and alternating with cavities which are their own negatives or casts.

§ X. One other form of the dogtooth is of great importance in northern architecture, that produced
by oblique cuts slightly curved, as in the margin, Fig. LVI. It is susceptible of the most
fantastic and endless decoration; each of the resulting leaves being, in the early porches
of Rouen and Lisieux, hollowed out and worked into branching tracery: and at Bourges, for distant
effect, worked into plain leaves, or bold bony processes with knobs at the points, and near
the spectator, into crouching demons and broad winged owls, and other fancies and intricacies,
innumerable and inexpressible.

§ XI. Thus much is enough to be noted respecting edge decoration. We were next to consider
the fillet. Professor Willis has noticed an ornament, which he has called the Venetian dentil,
"as the most universal ornament in its own district that ever I met with;" but has not noticed
the reason for its frequency. It is nevertheless highly interesting.

The whole early architecture of Venice is architecture of incrustation: this has not been enough
noticed in its peculiar relation to that of the rest of Italy. There is, indeed, much incrusted
architecture throughout Italy, in elaborate ecclesiastical work, but there is more which is
frankly of brick, or thoroughly of stone. But the Venetian habitually incrusted his work with
nacre; he built his houses, even the meanest, as if he had been a shell-fish,--roughly inside,
mother-of-pearl on the surface: he was content, perforce, to gather the clay of the Brenta
banks, and bake it into brick for his substance of wall; but he overlaid it with the wealth
of ocean, with the most precious foreign marbles. You might fancy early Venice one wilderness
of brick, which a petrifying sea had beaten upon till it coated it with marble: at first a
dark city--washed white by the sea foam. And I told you before that it was also a city of shafts
and arches, and that its dwellings were raised upon continuous arcades, among which the sea
waves wandered. Hence the thoughts of its builders were early and constantly directed to the
incrustation of arches.

§ XII. In Fig. LVII. I have given two of these Byzantine stilted arches: the one on the right,
a, as they now too often appear, in its bare brickwork; that on the left, with its alabaster
covering, literally marble defensive armor, riveted together in pieces, which follow the contours
of the building. Now, on the wall, these pieces are mere flat slabs cut to the arch outline;
but under the soffit of the arch the marble mail is curved, often cut singularly thin, like
bent tiles, and fitted together so that the pieces would sustain each other even without rivets.
It is of course desirable that this thin sub-arch of marble should project enough to sustain
the facing of the wall; and the reader will see, in Fig. LVII., that its edge forms a kind
of narrow band round the arch (b), a band which the least enrichment would render a valuable
decorative feature. Now this band is, of course, if the soffit-pieces project a little beyond
the face of the wall-pieces, a mere fillet, like the wooden gunwale in Plate IX.; and the question
is, how to enrich it most wisely. It might easily have been dogtoothed, but the Byzantine architects
had not invented the dogtooth, and would not have used it here, if they had; for the dogtooth
cannot be employed alone, especially on so principal an angle as this of the main arches, without
giving to the whole building a peculiar look, which I can not otherwise describe than as being
to the eye, exactly what untempered acid is to the tongue. The mere dogtooth is an acid moulding,
and can only be used in certain mingling with others, to give them piquancy; never alone. What,
then, will be the next easiest method of giving interest to the fillet?

§ XIII. Simply to make the incisions square instead of sharp, and to leave equal intervals
of the square edge between them. Fig. LVIII. is one of the curved pieces of arch armor, with
its edge thus treated; one side only being done at the bottom, to show the simplicity and ease
of the work. This ornament gives force and interest to the edge of the arch, without in the
least diminishing its quietness. Nothing was ever, nor could be ever invented, fitter for its
purpose, or more easily cut. From the arch it therefore found its way into every position where
the edge of a piece of stone projected, and became, from its constancy of occurrence in the
latest Gothic as well as the earliest Byzantine, most truly deserving of the name of the "Venetian
Dentil." Its complete intention is now, however, only to be seen in the pictures of Gentile
Bellini and Vittor Carpaccio; for, like most of the rest of the mouldings of Venetian buildings,
it was always either gilded or painted--often both, gold being laid on the faces of the dentils,
and their recesses colored alternately red and blue.

§ XIV. Observe, however, that the reason above given for the universality of this ornament
was by no means the reason of its invention. The Venetian dentil is a particular application
(consequent on the incrusted character of Venetian architecture) of the general idea of dentil,
which had been originally given by the Greeks, and realised both by them and by the Byzantines
in many laborious forms, long before there was need of them for arch armor; and the lower half
of Plate IX. will give some idea of the conditions which occur in the Romanesque of Venice,
distinctly derived from the classical dentil; and of the gradual transition to the more convenient
and simple type, the running-hand dentil, which afterwards became the characteristic of Venetian
Gothic. No. 13[76] is the common dentiled cornice, which occurs repeatedly in St. Mark's; and,
as late as the thirteenth century, a reduplication of it, forming the abaci of the capitals
of the Piazzetta shafts. Fig. 15 is perhaps an earlier type; perhaps only one of more careless
workmanship, from a Byzantine ruin in the Rio di Ca' Foscari: and it is interesting to compare
it with fig. 14 from the Cathedral of Vienne, in South France. Fig. 17, from St. Mark's, and
18, from the apse of Murano, are two very early examples in which the future true Venetian
dentil is already developed in method of execution, though the object is still only to imitate
the classical one; and a rude imitation of the bead is joined with it in fig. 17. No. 16 indicates
two examples of experimental forms: the uppermost from the tomb of Mastino della Scala, at
Verona; the lower from a door in Venice, I believe, of the thirteenth century: 19 is a more
frequent arrangement, chiefly found in cast brick, and connecting the dentils with the dogteeth:
20 is a form introduced richly in the later Gothic, but of rare occurrence until the latter
half of the thirteenth century. I shall call it the gabled dentil. It is found in the greatest
profusion in sepulchral Gothic, associated with several slight variations from the usual dentil
type, of which No. 21, from the tomb of Pietro Cornaro, may serve as an example.

§ XV. All the forms given in Plate IX. are of not unfrequent occurrence: varying much in size
and depth, according to the expression of the work in which they occur; generally increasing
in size in late work (the earliest dentils are seldom more than an inch or an inch and a half
long: the fully developed dentil of the later Gothic is often as much as four or five in length,
by one and a half in breadth); but they are all somewhat rare, compared to the true or armor
dentil, above described. On the other hand, there are one or two unique conditions, which will
be noted in the buildings where they occur.[77] The Ducal Palace furnishes three anomalies
in the arch, dogtooth, and dentil: it has a hyperbolic arch, as noted above, Chap. X., § XV.;
it has a double-fanged dogtooth in the rings of the spiral shafts on its angles; and, finally,
it has a dentil with concave sides, of which the section and two of the blocks, real size,
are given in Plate XIV. The labor of obtaining this difficult profile has, however, been thrown
away; for the effect of the dentil at ten feet distance is exactly the same as that of the
usual form: and the reader may consider the dogtooth and dentil in that plate as fairly representing
the common use of them in the Venetian Gothic.

§ XVI. I am aware of no other form of fillet decoration requiring notice: in the Northern Gothic,
the fillet is employed chiefly to give severity or flatness to mouldings supposed to be too
much rounded, and is therefore generally plain. It is itself an ugly moulding, and, when thus
employed, is merely a foil for others, of which, however, it at last usurped the place, and
became one of the most painful features in the debased Gothic both of Italy and the North.

FOOTNOTES:

  [74] I do not here speak of artistical merits, but the play of the
    light among the lower shafts is also singularly beautiful in this
    sketch of Prout's, and the character of the wild and broken leaves,
    half dead, on the stone of the foreground.

  [75] Vide the "Seven Lamps," p. 122.

  [76] The sections of all the mouldings are given on the right of
    each; the part which is constantly solid being shaded, and that
    which is cut into dentils left.

  [77] As, however, we shall not probably be led either to Bergamo or
    Bologna, I may mention here a curiously rich use of the dentil,
    entirely covering the foliation and tracery of a niche on the
    outside of the duomo of Bergamo; and a roll, entirely incrusted, as
    the handle of a mace often is with nails, with massy dogteeth or
    nail-heads, on the door of the Pepoli palace of Bologna.

CHAPTER XXIV.

  THE ROLL AND RECESS.

§ I. I have classed these two means of architectural effect together, because the one is in
most cases the negative of the other, and is used to relieve it exactly as shadow relieves
light; recess alternating with roll, not only in lateral, but in successive order; not merely
side by side with each other, but interrupted the one by the other in their own lines. A recess
itself has properly no decoration; but its depth gives value to the decoration which flanks,
encloses, or interrupts it, and the form which interrupts it best is the roll.

§ II. I use the word roll generally for any mouldings which present to the eye somewhat the
appearance of being cylindrical, and look like round rods. When upright, they are in appearance,
if not in fact, small shafts; and are a kind of bent shaft, even when used in archivolts and
traceries;--when horizontal, they confuse themselves with cornices, and are, in fact, generally
to be considered as the best means of drawing an architectural line in any direction, the soft
curve of their side obtaining some shadow at nearly all times of the day, and that more tender
and grateful to the eye than can be obtained either by an incision or by any other form of
projection.

§ III. Their decorative power is, however, too slight for rich work, and they frequently require,
like the angle and the fillet, to be rendered interesting by subdivision or minor ornament
of their own. When the roll is small, this is effected, exactly as in the case of the fillet,
by cutting pieces out of it; giving in the simplest results what is called the Norman billet
moulding: and when the cuts are given in couples, and the pieces rounded into spheres and almonds,
we have the ordinary Greek bead, both of them too well known to require illustration. The Norman
billet we shall not meet with in Venice; the bead constantly occurs in Byzantine, and of course
in Renaissance work. In Plate IX., Fig. 17, there is a remarkable example of its early treatment,
where the cuts in it are left sharp.

§ IV. But the roll, if it be of any size, deserves better treatment. Its rounded surface is
too beautiful to be cut away in notches; and it is rather to be covered with flat chasing or
inlaid patterns. Thus ornamented, it gradually blends itself with the true shaft, both in the
Romanesque work of the North, and in the Italian connected schools; and the patterns used for
it are those used for shaft decoration in general.

§ V. But, as alternating with the recess, it has a decoration peculiar to itself. We have often,
in the preceding chapters, noted the fondness of the Northern builders for deep shade and hollowness
in their mouldings; and in the second chapter of the "Seven Lamps," the changes are described
which reduced the massive roll mouldings of the early Gothic to a series of recesses, separated
by bars of light. The shape of these recesses is at present a matter of no importance to us:
it was, indeed, endlessly varied; but needlessly, for the value of a recess is in its darkness,
and its darkness disguises its form. But it was not in mere wanton indulgence of their love
of shade that the Flamboyant builders deepened the furrows of their mouldings: they had found
a means of decorating those furrows as rich as it was expressive, and the entire frame-work
of their architecture was designed with a view to the effect of this decoration; where the
ornament ceases, the frame-work is meagre and mean: but the ornament is, in the best examples
of the style, unceasing.

§ VI. It is, in fact, an ornament formed by the ghosts or anatomies of the old shafts, left
in the furrows which had taken their place. Every here and there, a fragment of a roll or shaft
is left in the recess or furrow: a billet-moulding on a huge scale, but a billet-moulding reduced
to a skeleton; for the fragments of roll are cut hollow, and worked into mere entanglement
of stony fibres, with the gloom of the recess shown through them. These ghost rolls, forming
sometimes pedestals, sometimes canopies, sometimes covering the whole recess with an arch of
tracery, beneath which it runs like a tunnel, are the peculiar decorations of the Flamboyant
Gothic.

§ VII. Now observe, in all kinds of decoration, we must keep carefully under separate heads,
the consideration of the changes wrought in the mere physical form, and in the intellectual
purpose of ornament. The relations of the canopy to the statue it shelters, are to be considered
altogether distinctly from those of the canopy to the building which it decorates. In its earliest
conditions the canopy is partly confused with representations of miniature architecture: it
is sometimes a small temple or gateway, sometimes a honorary addition to the pomp of a saint,
a covering to his throne, or to his shrine; and this canopy is often expressed in bas-relief
(as in painting), without much reference to the great requirements of the building. At other
times it is a real protection to the statue, and is enlarged into a complete pinnacle, carried
on proper shafts, and boldly roofed. But in the late northern system the canopies are neither
expressive nor protective. They are a kind of stone lace-work, required for the ornamentation
of the building, for which the statues are often little more than an excuse, and of which the
physical character is, as above described, that of ghosts of departed shafts.

§ VIII. There is, of course, much rich tabernacle work which will not come literally under
this head, much which is straggling or flat in its plan, connecting itself gradually with the
ordinary forms of independent shrines and tombs; but the general idea of all tabernacle work
is marked in the common phrase of a "niche," that is to say a hollow intended for a statue,
and crowned by a canopy; and this niche decoration only reaches its full development when the
Flamboyant hollows are cut deepest, and when the manner and spirit of sculpture had so much
lost their purity and intensity that it became desirable to draw the eye away from the statue
to its covering, so that at last the canopy became the more important of the two, and is itself
so beautiful that we are often contented with architecture from which profanity has struck
the statues, if only the canopies are left; and consequently, in our modern ingenuity, even
set up canopies where we have no intention of setting statues.

§ IX. It is a pity that thus we have no really noble example of the effect of the statue in
the recesses of architecture: for the Flamboyant recess was not so much a preparation for it
as a gulf which swallowed it up. When statues were most earnestly designed, they were thrust
forward in all kinds of places, often in front of the pillars, as at Amiens, awkwardly enough,
but with manly respect to the purpose of the figures. The Flamboyant hollows yawned at their
sides, the statues fell back into them, and nearly disappeared, and a flash of flame in the
shape of a canopy rose as they expired.

§ X. I do not feel myself capable at present of speaking with perfect justice of this niche
ornament of the north, my late studies in Italy having somewhat destroyed my sympathies with
it. But I once loved it intensely, and will not say anything to depreciate it now, save only
this, that while I have studied long at Abbeville, without in the least finding that it made
me care less for Verona, I never remained long in Verona without feeling some doubt of the
nobility of Abbeville.

§ XI. Recess decoration by leaf mouldings is constantly and beautifully associated in the north
with niche decoration, but requires no special notice, the recess in such cases being used
merely to give value to the leafage by its gloom, and the difference between such conditions
and those of the south being merely that in the one the leaves are laid across a hollow, and
in the other over a solid surface; but in neither of the schools exclusively so, each in some
degree intermingling the method of the other.

§ XII. Finally the recess decoration by the ball flower is very definite and characteristic,
found, I believe, chiefly in English work. It consists merely in leaving a small boss or sphere,
fixed, as it were, at intervals in the hollows; such bosses being afterwards carved into roses,
or other ornamental forms, and sometimes lifted quite up out of the hollow, on projecting processes,
like vertebræ, so as to make them more conspicuous, as throughout the decoration of the cathedral
of Bourges.

The value of this ornament is chiefly in the spotted character which it gives to the lines
of mouldings seen from a distance. It is very rich and delightful when not used in excess;
but it would satiate and weary the eye if it were ever used in general architecture. The spire
of Salisbury, and of St. Mary's at Oxford, are agreeable as isolated masses; but if an entire
street were built with this spotty decoration at every casement, we could not traverse it to
the end without disgust. It is only another example of the constant aim at piquancy of effect
which characterised the northern builders; an ingenious but somewhat vulgar effort to give
interest to their grey masses of coarse stone, without overtaking their powers either of invention
or execution. We will thank them for it without blame or praise, and pass on.

CHAPTER XXV.

  THE BASE.

§ I. We know now as much as is needful respecting the methods of minor and universal decorations,
which were distinguished in Chapter XXII., § III., from the ornament which has special relation
to particular parts. This local ornament, which, it will be remembered, we arranged in § II.
of the same chapter under five heads, we have next, under those heads, to consider. And, first,
the ornament of the bases, both of walls and shafts.

It was noticed in our account of the divisions of a wall, that there are something in those
divisions like the beginning, the several courses, and the close of a human life. And as, in
all well-conducted lives, the hard work, and roughing, and gaining of strength come first,
the honor or decoration in certain intervals during their course, but most of all in their
close, so, in general, the base of the wall, which is its beginning of labor, will bear least
decoration, its body more, especially those epochs of rest called its string courses; but its
crown or cornice most of all. Still, in some buildings, all these are decorated richly, though
the last most; and in others, when the base is well protected and yet conspicuous, it may probably
receive even more decoration than other parts.

§ II. Now, the main things to be expressed in a base are its levelness and evenness. We cannot
do better than construct the several members of the base, as developed in Fig. II., p. 55,
each of a different colored marble, so as to produce marked level bars of color all along the
foundation. This is exquisitely done in all the Italian elaborate wall bases; that of St. Anastasia
at Verona is one of the most perfect existing, for play of color; that of Giotto's campanile
is on the whole the most beautifully finished. Then, on the vertical portions, a, b, c, we
may put what patterns in mosaic we please, so that they be not too rich; but if we choose rather
to have sculpture (or must have it for want of stones to inlay), then observe that all sculpture
on bases must be in panels, or it will soon be worn away, and that a plain panelling is often
good without any other ornament. The member b, which in St. Mark's is subordinate, and c, which
is expanded into a seat, are both of them decorated with simple but exquisitely-finished panelling,
in red and white or green and white marble; and the member e is in bases of this kind very
valuable, as an expression of a firm beginning of the substance of the wall itself. This member
has been of no service to us hitherto, and was unnoticed in the chapters on construction; but
it was expressed in the figure of the wall base, on account of its great value when the foundation
is of stone and the wall of brick (coated or not). In such cases it is always better to add
the course e, above the slope of the base, than abruptly to begin the common masonry of the wall.

§ III. It is, however, with the member d, or Xb, that we are most seriously concerned; for
this being the essential feature of all bases, and the true preparation for the wall or shaft,
it is most necessary that here, if anywhere, we should have full expression of levelness and
precision; and farther, that, if possible, the eye should not be suffered to rest on the points
of junction of the stones, which would give an effect of instability. Both these objects are
accomplished by attracting the eye to two rolls, separated by a deep hollow, in the member
d itself. The bold projections of their mouldings entirely prevent the attention from being
drawn to the joints of the masonry, and besides form a simple but beautifully connected group
of bars of shadow, which express, in their perfect parallelism, the absolute levelness of the
foundation.

§ IV. I need hardly give any perspective drawing of an arrangement which must be perfectly
familiar to the reader, as occurring under nearly every column of the too numerous classical
buildings all over Europe. But I may name the base of the Bank of England as furnishing a very
simple instance of the group, with a square instead of a rounded hollow, both forming the base
of the wall, and gathering into that of the shafts as they occur; while the bases of the pillars
of the façade of the British Museum are as good examples as the reader can study on a larger scale.

§ V. I believe this group of mouldings was first invented by the Greeks, and it has never been
materially improved, as far as its peculiar purpose is concerned;[78] the classical attempts
at its variation being the ugliest: one, the using a single roll of larger size, as may be
seen in the Duke of York's column, which therefore looks as if it stood on a large sausage
(the Monument has the same base, but more concealed by pedestal decoration): another, the using
two rolls without the intermediate cavetto,--a condition hardly less awkward, and which may
be studied to advantage in the wall and shaftbases of the Athenæum Club-house: and another,
the introduction of what are called fillets between the rolls, as may be seen in the pillars
of Hanover Chapel, Regent Street, which look, in consequence, as if they were standing upon
a pile of pewter collection plates. But the only successful changes have been mediæval; and
their nature will be at once understood by a glance at the varieties given on the opposite
page. It will be well first to give the buildings in which they occur, in order.

§ VI. Eighteen out of the twenty eight varieties are Venetian, being bases to which I shall
have need of future reference; but the interspersed examples, 8, 9, 12, and 19, from Milan,
Pavia, Vienne (France), and Verona, show the exactly correspondent conditions of the Romanesque
base at the period, throughout the centre of Europe. The last five examples show the changes
effected by the French Gothic architects: the Salisbury base (22) I have only introduced to
show its dulness and vulgarity beside them; and 23, from Torcello, for a special reason, in
that place.

§ VII. The reader will observe that the two bases, 8 and 9, from the two most important Lombardic
churches of Italy, St. Ambrogio of Milan and St. Michele of Pavia, mark the character of the
barbaric base founded on pure Roman models, sometimes approximating to such models very closely;
and the varieties 10, 11, 13, 16 are Byzantine types, also founded on Roman models. But in
the bases 1 to 7 inclusive, and, still more characteristically, in 23 below, there is evidently
an original element, a tendency to use the fillet and hollow instead of the roll, which is
eminently Gothic; which in the base 3 reminds one even of Flamboyant conditions, and is excessively
remarkable as occurring in Italian work certainly not later than the tenth century, taking
even the date of the last rebuilding of the Duomo of Torcello, though I am strongly inclined
to consider these bases portions of the original church. And I have therefore put the base
23 among the Gothic group to which it has so strong relationship, though, on the last supposition,
five centuries older than the earliest of the five terminal examples; and it is still more
remarkable because it reverses the usual treatment of the lower roll, which is in general a
tolerably accurate test of the age of a base, in the degree of its projection. Thus, in the
examples 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, the lower roll is hardly rounded at all, and diametrically
opposed to the late Gothic conditions, 24 to 28, in which it advances gradually, like a wave
preparing to break, and at last is actually seen curling over with the long-backed rush of
surf upon the shore. Yet the Torcello base resembles these Gothic ones both in expansion beneath
and in depth of cavetto above.

§ VIII. There can be no question of the ineffable superiority of these Gothic bases, in grace
of profile, to any ever invented by the ancients. But they have all two great faults: They
seem, in the first place, to have been designed without sufficient reference to the necessity
of their being usually seen from above; their grace of profile cannot be estimated when so
seen, and their excessive expansion gives them an appearance of flatness and separation from
the shaft, as if they had splashed out under its pressure: in the second place their cavetto
is so deeply cut that it has the appearance of a black fissure between the members of the base;
and in the Lyons and Bourges shafts, 24 and 26, it is impossible to conquer the idea suggested
by it, that the two stones above and below have been intended to join close, but that some
pebbles have got in and kept them from fitting; one is always expecting the pebbles to be crushed,
and the shaft to settle into its place with a thunder-clap.

§ IX. For these reasons, I said that the profile of the pure classic base had hardly been materially
improved; but the various conditions of it are beautiful or commonplace, in proportion to the
variety of proportion among their lines and the delicacy of their curvatures; that is to say,
the expression of characters like those of the abstract lines in Plate VII.

The five best profiles in Plate X. are 10, 17, 19, 20, 21; 10 is peculiarly beautiful in the
opposition between the bold projection of its upper roll, and the delicate leafy curvature
of its lower; and this and 21 may be taken as nearly perfect types, the one of the steep, the
other of the expansive basic profiles. The characters of all, however, are so dependent upon
their place and expression, that it is unfair to judge them thus separately; and the precision
of curvature is a matter of so small consequence in general effect, that we need not here pursue
the subject farther.

§ X. We have thus far, however, considered only the lines of moulding in the member X b, whether
of wall or shaft base. But the reader will remember that in our best shaft base, in Fig. XII.
(p. 78), certain props or spurs were applied to the slope of X b; but now that X b is divided
into these delicate mouldings, we cannot conveniently apply the spur to its irregular profile;
we must be content to set it against the lower roll. Let the upper edge of this lower roll
be the curved line here, a, d, e, b, Fig. LIX., and c the angle of the square plinth projecting
beneath it. Then the spur, applied as we saw in Chap. VII., will be of some such form as the
triangle c e d, Fig. LIX.

§ XI. Now it has just been stated that it is of small importance whether the abstract lines
of the profile of a base moulding be fine or not, because we rarely stoop down to look at them.
But this triangular spur is nearly always seen from above, and the eye is drawn to it as one
of the most important features of the whole base; therefore it is a point of immediate necessity
to substitute for its harsh right lines (c d, c e) some curve of noble abstract character.

§ XII. I mentioned, in speaking of the line of the salvia leaf at p. 224, that I had marked
off the portion of it, x y, because I thought it likely to be generally useful to us afterwards;
and I promised the reader that as he had built, so he should decorate his edifice at his own
free will. If, therefore, he likes the above triangular spur, c d e, by all means let him keep
it; but if he be on the whole dissatisfied with it, I may be permitted, perhaps, to advise
him to set to work like a tapestry bee, to cut off the little bit of line of salvia leaf x
y, and try how he can best substitute it for the awkward lines c d c e. He may try it any way
that he likes; but if he puts the salvia curvature inside the present lines, he will find the
spur looks weak, and I think he will determine at last on placing it as I have done at c d,
c e, Fig. LX. (If the reader will be at the pains to transfer the salvia leaf line with tracing
paper, he will find it accurately used in this figure.) Then I merely add an outer circular
line to represent the outer swell of the roll against which the spur is set, and I put another
such spur to the opposite corner of the square, and we have the half base, Fig. LX., which
is a general type of the best Gothic bases in existence, being very nearly that of the upper
shafts of the Ducal Palace of Venice. In those shafts the quadrant a b, or the upper edge of
the lower roll, is 2 feet 1-3/8 inches round, and the base of the spur d e, is 10 inches; the
line d e being therefore to a b as 10 to 25-3/8. In Fig. LX. it is as 10 to 24, the measurement
being easier and the type somewhat more generally representative of the best, i.e. broadest,
spurs of Italian Gothic.

§ XIII. Now, the reader is to remember, there is nothing magical in salvia leaves: the line
I take from them happened merely to fall conveniently on the page, and might as well have been
taken from anything else; it is simply its character of gradated curvature which fits it for
our use. On Plate XI., opposite, I have given plans of the spurs and quadrants of twelve Italian
and three Northern bases; these latter (13), from Bourges, (14) from Lyons, (15) from Rouen,
are given merely to show the Northern disposition to break up bounding lines, and lose breadth
in picturesqueness. These Northern bases look the prettiest in this plate, because this variation
of the outline is nearly all the ornament they have, being cut very rudely; but the Italian
bases above them are merely prepared by their simple outlines for far richer decoration at
the next step, as we shall see presently. The Northern bases are to be noted also for another
grand error: the projection of the roll beyond the square plinth, of which the corner is seen,
in various degrees of advancement, in the three examples. 13 is the base whose profile is No.
26 in Plate X.; 14 is 24 in the same plate; and 15 is 28.

§ XIV. The Italian bases are the following; all, except 7 and 10, being Venetian: 1 and 2,
upper colonnade, St. Mark's; 3, Ca' Falier; 4, lower colonnade, and 5, transept, St. Mark's;
6, from the Church of St. John and Paul; 7, from the tomb near St. Anastasia, Verona, described
above (p. 142); 8 and 9, Fon daco de' Turchi, Venice; 10, tomb of Can Mastino della Scala,
Verona; 11, San Stefano, Venice; 12, Ducal Palace, Venice, upper colonnade. The Nos. 3, 8,
9, 11 are the bases whose profiles are respectively Nos. 18, 11, 13, and 20 in Plate X. The
flat surfaces of the basic plinths are here shaded; and in the lower corner of the square occupied
by each quadrant is put, also shaded, the central profile of each spur, from its root at the
roll of the base to its point; those of Nos. 1 and 2 being conjectural, for their spurs were
so rude and ugly, that I took no note of their profiles; but they would probably be as here
given. As these bases, though here, for the sake of comparison, reduced within squares of equal
size, in reality belong to shafts of very different size, 9 being some six or seven inches
in diameter, and 6, three or four feet, the proportionate size of the roll varies accordingly,
being largest, as in 9, where the base is smallest, and in 6 and 12 the leaf profile is given
on a larger scale than the plan, or its character could not have been exhibited.

§ XV. Now, in all these spurs, the reader will observe that the narrowest are for the most
part the earliest. No. 2, from the upper colonnade of St. Mark's, is the only instance I ever
saw of the double spur, as transitive between the square and octagon plinth; the truncated
form, 1, is also rare and very ugly. Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 are the general conditions of the
Byzantine spur; 8 is a very rare form of plan in Byzantine work, but proved to be so by its
rude level profile; while 7, on the contrary, Byzantine in plan, is eminently Gothic in the
profile. 9 to 12 are from formed Gothic buildings, equally refined in their profile and plan.

§ XVI. The character of the profile is indeed much altered by the accidental nature of the
surface decoration; but the importance of the broad difference between the raised and flat
profile will be felt on glancing at the examples 1 to 6 in Plate XII. The three upper examples
are the Romanesque types, which occur as parallels with the Byzantine types, 1 to 3 of Plate
XI. Their plans would be nearly the same; but instead of resembling flat leaves, they are literally
spurs, or claws, as high as they are broad; and the third, from St. Michele of Pavia, appears
to be intended to have its resemblance to a claw enforced by the transverse fillet. 1 is from
St. Ambrogio, Milan; 2 from Vienne, France. The 4th type, Plate XII., almost like the extremity
of a man's foot, is a Byzantine form (perhaps worn on the edges), from the nave of St. Mark's;
and the two next show the unity of the two principles, forming the perfect Italian Gothic types,--5,
from tomb of Can Signorio della Scala, Verona; 6, from San Stefano, Venice (the base 11 of
Plate XI., in perspective). The two other bases, 10 and 12 of Plate XI., are conditions of
the same kind, showing the varieties of rise and fall in exquisite modulation; the 10th, a
type more frequent at Verona than Venice, in which the spur profile overlaps the roll, instead
of rising out of it, and seems to hold it down, as if it were a ring held by sockets. This
is a character found both in early and late work; a kind of band, or fillet, appears to hold,
and even compress, the centre of the roll in the base of one of the crypt shafts of St. Peter's,
Oxford, which has also spurs at its angles; and long bands flow over the base of the angle
shaft of the Ducal Palace of Venice, next the Porta della Carta.

§ XVII. When the main contours of the base are once determined, its decoration is as easy as
it is infinite. I have merely given, in Plate XII., three examples to which I shall need to
refer, hereafter. No. 9 is a very early and curious one; the decoration of the base 6 in Plate
XI., representing a leaf turned over and flattened down; or, rather, the idea of the turned
leaf, worked as well as could be imagined on the flat contour of the spur. Then 10 is the perfect,
but simplest possible development of the same idea, from the earliest bases of the upper colonnade
of the Ducal Palace, that is to say, the bases of the sea façade; and 7 and 8 are its lateral
profile and transverse section. Finally, 11 and 12 are two of the spurs of the later shafts
of the same colonnade on the Piazzetta side (No. 12 of Plate XI.). No. 11 occurs on one of
these shafts only, and is singularly beautiful. I suspect it to be earlier than the other,
which is the characteristic base of the rest of the series, and already shows the loose, sensual,
ungoverned character of fifteenth century ornament in the dissoluteness of its rolling.

§ XVIII. I merely give these as examples ready to my hand, and necessary for future reference;
not as in anywise representative of the variety of the Italian treatment of the general contour,
far less of the endless caprices of the North. The most beautiful base I ever saw, on the whole,
is a Byzantine one in the Baptistery of St. Mark's, in which the spur profile approximates
to that of No. 10 in Plate XI.; but it is formed by a cherub, who sweeps downwards on the wing.
His two wings, as they half close, form the upper part of the spur, and the rise of it in the
front is formed by exactly the action of Alichino, swooping on the pitch lake: "quei drizzo,
volando, suso il petto." But it requires noble management to confine such a fancy within such
limits. The greater number of the best bases are formed of leaves; and the reader may amuse
himself as he will by endless inventions of them, from types which he may gather among the
weeds at the nearest roadside. The value of the vegetable form is especially here, as above
noted, Chap. XX., § XXXII., its capability of unity with the mass of the base, and of being
suggested by few lines; none but the Northern Gothic architects are able to introduce entire
animal forms in this position with perfect success. There is a beautiful instance at the north
door of the west front of Rouen; a lizard pausing and curling himself round a little in the
angle; one expects him the next instant to lash round the shaft and vanish: and we may with
advantage compare this base with those of Renaissance Scuola di San Rocca[79] at Venice, in
which the architect, imitating the mediæval bases, which he did not understand, has put an
elephant, four inches higher, in the same position.

§ XIX. I have not in this chapter spoken at all of the profiles which are given in Northern
architecture to the projections of the lower members of the base, b and c in Fig. II., nor
of the methods in which both these, and the rolls of the mouldings in Plate X., are decorated,
especially in Roman architecture, with superadded chain work or chasing of various patterns.
Of the first I have not spoken, because I shall have no occasion to allude to them in the following
essay; nor of the second, because I consider them barbarisms. Decorated rolls and decorated
ogee profiles, such, for instance, as the base of the Arc de l'Etoile at Paris, are among the
richest and farthest refinements of decorative appliances; and they ought always to be reserved
for jambs, cornices, and archivolts: if you begin with them in the base, you have no power
of refining your decorations as you ascend, and, which is still worse, you put your most delicate
work on the jutting portions of the foundation,--the very portions which are most exposed to
abrasion. The best expression of a base is that of stern endurance,--the look of being able
to bear roughing; or, if the whole building is so delicate that no one can be expected to treat
even its base with unkindness,[80] then at least the expression of quiet, prefatory simplicity.
The angle spur may receive such decoration as we have seen, because it is one of the most important
features in the whole building; and the eye is always so attracted to it that it cannot be
in rich architecture left altogether blank; the eye is stayed upon it by its position, but
glides, and ought to glide, along the basic rolls to take measurement of their length: and
even with all this added fitness, the ornament of the basic spur is best, in the long run,
when it is boldest and simplest. The base above described, § XVIII., as the most beautiful
I ever saw, was not for that reason the best I ever saw: beautiful in its place, in a quiet
corner of a Baptistery sheeted with jasper and alabaster, it would have been utterly wrong,
nay, even offensive, if used in sterner work, or repeated along a whole colonnade. The base
No. 10 of Plate XII. is the richest with which I was ever perfectly satisfied for general service;
and the basic spurs of the building which I have named as the best Gothic monument in the world
(p. 141), have no ornament upon them whatever. The adaptation, therefore, of rich cornice and
roll mouldings to the level and ordinary lines of bases, whether of walls or shafts, I hold
to be one of the worst barbarisms which the Roman and Renaissance architects ever committed;
and that nothing can afterwards redeem the effeminacy and vulgarity of the buildings in which
it prominently takes place.

§ XX. I have also passed over, without present notice, the fantastic bases formed by couchant
animals, which sustain many Lombardic shafts. The pillars they support have independent bases
of the ordinary kind; and the animal form beneath is less to be considered as a true base (though
often exquisitely combined with it, as in the shaft on the south-west angle of the cathedral
of Genoa) than as a piece of sculpture, otherwise necessary to the nobility of the building,
and deriving its value from its special positive fulfilment of expressional purposes, with
which we have here no concern. As the embodiment of a wild superstition, and the representation
of supernatural powers, their appeal to the imagination sets at utter defiance all judgment
based on ordinary canons of law; and the magnificence of their treatment atones, in nearly
every case, for the extravagance of their conception. I should not admit this appeal to the
imagination, if it had been made by a nation in whom the powers of body and mind had been languid;
but by the Lombard, strong in all the realities of human life, we need not fear being led astray:
the visions of a distempered fancy are not indeed permitted to replace the truth, or set aside
the laws of science: but the imagination which is thoroughly under the command of the intelligent
will,[81] has a dominion indiscernible by science, and illimitable by law; and we may acknowledge
the authority of the Lombardic gryphons in the mere splendor of their presence, without thinking
idolatry an excuse for mechanical misconstruction, or dreading to be called upon, in other
cases, to admire a systemless architecture, because it may happen to have sprung from an irrational
religion.

FOOTNOTES:

  [78] Another most important reason for the peculiar sufficiency and
    value of this base, especially as opposed to the bulging forms of
    the single or double roll, without the cavetto, has been suggested
    by the writer of the Essay on the Æsthetics of Gothic Architecture
    in the British Quarterly for August, 1849:--"The Attic base
    recedes at the point where, if it suffered from superincumbent
    weight, it would bulge out."

  [79] I have put in Appendix 24, "Renaissance Bases," my memorandum
    written respecting this building on the spot. But the reader had
    better delay referring to it, until we have completed our
    examination of ornaments in shafts and capitals.

  [80] Appendix 25, "Romanist Decoration of Bases."

  [81] In all the wildness of the Lombardic fancy (described in
    Appendix 8), this command of the will over its action is as distinct
    as it is stern. The fancy is, in the early work of the nation,
    visibly diseased; but never the will, nor the reason.

CHAPTER XXVI.

  THE WALL VEIL AND SHAFT.

§ I. No subject has been more open ground of dispute among architects than the decoration of
the wall veil, because no decoration appeared naturally to grow out of its construction; nor
could any curvatures be given to its surface large enough to produce much impression on the
eye. It has become, therefore, a kind of general field for experiments of various effects of
surface ornament, or has been altogether abandoned to the mosaicist and fresco painter. But
we may perhaps conclude, from what was advanced in the Fifth Chapter, that there is one kind
of decoration which will, indeed, naturally follow on its construction. For it is perfectly
natural that the different kinds of stone used in its successive courses should be of different
colors; and there are many associations and analogies which metaphysically justify the introduction
of horizontal bands of color, or of light and shade. They are, in the first place, a kind of
expression of the growth or age of the wall, like the rings in the wood of a tree; then they
are a farther symbol of the alternation of light and darkness, which was above noted as the
source of the charm of many inferior mouldings: again, they are valuable as an expression of
horizontal space to the imagination, space of which the conception is opposed, and gives more
effect by its opposition, to the enclosing power of the wall itself (this I spoke of as probably
the great charm of these horizontal bars to the Arabian mind): and again they are valuable
in their suggestion of the natural courses of rocks, and beds of the earth itself. And to all
these powerful imaginative reasons we have to add the merely ocular charm of interlineal opposition
of color; a charm so great, that all the best colorists, without a single exception, depend
upon it for the most piquant of their pictorial effects, some vigorous mass of alternate stripes
or bars of color being made central in all their richest arrangements. The whole system of
Tintoret's great picture of the Miracle of St. Mark is poised on the bars of blue, which cross
the white turban of the executioner.

§ II. There are, therefore, no ornaments more deeply suggestive in their simplicity than these
alternate bars of horizontal colors; nor do I know any buildings more noble than those of the
Pisan Romanesque, in which they are habitually employed; and certainly none so graceful, so
attractive, so enduringly delightful in their nobleness. Yet, of this pure and graceful ornamentation,
Professor Willis says, "a practice more destructive of architectural grandeur can hardly be
conceived:" and modern architects have substituted for it the ingenious ornament of which the
reader has had one specimen above, Fig. III., p. 61, and with which half the large buildings
in London are disfigured, or else traversed by mere straight lines, as, for instance, the back
of the Bank. The lines on the Bank may, perhaps, be considered typical of accounts; but in
general the walls, if left destitute of them, would have been as much fairer than the walls
charged with them, as a sheet of white paper is than the leaf of a ledger. But that the reader
may have free liberty of judgment in this matter, I place two examples of the old and the Renaissance
ornament side by side on the opposite page. That on the right is Romanesque, from St. Pietro
of Pistoja; that on the left, modern English, from the Arthur Club-house, St. James's Street.

§ III. But why, it will be asked, should the lines which mark the division of the stones be
wrong when they are chiselled, and right when they are marked by color? First, because the
color separation is a natural one. You build with different kinds of stone, of which, probably,
one is more costly than another; which latter, as you cannot construct your building of it
entirely, you arrange in conspicuous bars. But the chiselling of the stones is a wilful throwing
away of time and labor in defacing the building: it costs much to hew one of those monstrous
blocks into shape; and, when it is done, the building is weaker than it was before, by just
as much stone as has been cut away from its joints. And, secondly, because, as I have repeatedly
urged, straight lines are ugly things as lines, but admirable as limits of colored spaces;
and the joints of the stones, which are painful in proportion to their regularity, if drawn
as lines, are perfectly agreeable when marked by variations of hue.

§ IV. What is true of the divisions of stone by chiselling, is equally true of divisions of
bricks by pointing. Nor, of course, is the mere horizontal bar the only arrangement in which
the colors of brickwork or masonry can be gracefully disposed. It is rather one which can only
be employed with advantage when the courses of stone are deep and bold. When the masonry is
small, it is better to throw its colors into chequered patterns. We shall have several interesting
examples to study in Venice besides the well-known one of the Ducal Palace. The town of Moulins,
in France, is one of the most remarkable on this side the Alps for its chequered patterns in
bricks. The church of Christchurch, Streatham, lately built, though spoiled by many grievous
errors (the iron work in the campanile being the grossest), yet affords the inhabitants of
the district a means of obtaining some idea of the variety of effects which are possible with
no other material than brick.

§ V. We have yet to notice another effort of the Renaissance architects to adorn the blank
spaces of their walls by what is called Rustication. There is sometimes an obscure trace of
the remains of the imitation of something organic in this kind of work. In some of the better
French eighteenth century buildings it has a distinctly floral character, like a final degradation
of Flamboyant leafage; and some of our modern English architects appear to have taken the decayed
teeth of elephants for their type; but, for the most part, it resembles nothing so much as
worm casts; nor these with any precision. If it did, it would not bring it within the sphere
of our properly imitative ornamentation. I thought it unnecessary to warn the reader that he
was not to copy forms of refuse or corruption; and that, while he might legitimately take the
worm or the reptile for a subject of imitation, he was not to study the worm cast or coprolite.

§ VI. It is, however, I believe, sometimes supposed that rustication gives an appearance of
solidity to foundation stones. Not so; at least to any one who knows the look of a hard stone.
You may, by rustication, make your good marble or granite look like wet slime, honeycombed
by sand-eels, or like half-baked tufo covered with slow exudation of stalactite, or like rotten
claystone coated with concretions of its own mud; but not like the stones of which the hard
world is built. Do not think that nature rusticates her foundations. Smooth sheets of rock,
glistening like sea waves, and that ring under the hammer like a brazen bell,--that is her
preparation for first stories. She does rusticate sometimes: crumbly sand-stones, with their
ripple-marks filled with red mud; dusty lime-stones, which the rains wash into labyrinthine
cavities; spongy lavas, which the volcano blast drags hither and thither into ropy coils and
bubbling hollows;--these she rusticates, indeed, when she wants to make oyster-shells and magnesia
of them; but not when she needs to lay foundations with them. Then she seeks the polished surface
and iron heart, not rough looks and incoherent substance.

§ VII. Of the richer modes of wall decoration it is impossible to institute any general comparison;
they are quite infinite, from mere inlaid geometrical figures up to incrustations of elaborate
bas-relief. The architect has perhaps more license in them, and more power of producing good
effect with rude design than in any other features of the building; the chequer and hatchet
work of the Normans and the rude bas-reliefs of the Lombards being almost as satisfactory as
the delicate panelling and mosaic of the Duomo of Florence. But this is to be noted of all
good wall ornament, that it retains the expression of firm and massive substance, and of broad
surface, and that architecture instantly declined when linear design was substituted for massive,
and the sense of weight of wall was lost in a wilderness of upright or undulating rods. Of
the richest and most delicate wall veil decoration by inlaid work, as practised in Italy from
the twelfth to the fifteenth century, I have given the reader two characteristic examples in
Plates XX. and XXI.

§ VIII. There are, however, three spaces in which the wall veil, peculiarly limited in shape,
was always felt to be fitted for surface decoration of the most elaborate kind; and in these
spaces are found the most majestic instances of its treatment, even to late periods. One of
these is the spandril space, or the filling between any two arches, commonly of the shape a,
Fig. LXI.; the half of which, or the flank filling of any arch, is called a spandril. In Chapter
XVII., on Filling of Apertures, the reader will find another of these spaces noted, called
the tympanum, and commonly of the form b, Fig. LXI.: and finally, in Chapter XVIII., he will
find the third space described, that between an arch and its protecting gable, approximating
generally to the form c, Fig. LXI.

§ IX. The methods of treating these spaces might alone furnish subject for three very interesting
essays; but I shall only note the most essential points respecting them.

(1.) The Spandril. It was observed in Chapter XII., that this portion of the arch load might
frequently be lightened with great advantage by piercing it with a circle, or with a group
of circles; and the roof of the Euston Square railroad station was adduced as an example. One
of the spandril decorations of Bayeux Cathedral is given in the "Seven Lamps," Plate VII. fig.
4. It is little more than one of these Euston Square spandrils, with its circles foliated.

Sometimes the circle is entirely pierced; at other times it is merely suggested by a mosaic
or light tracery on the wall surface, as in the plate opposite, which is one of the spandrils
of the Ducal Palace at Venice. It was evidently intended that all the spandrils of this building
should be decorated in this manner, but only two of them seem to have been completed.[82]

§ X. The other modes of spandril filling may be broadly reduced to four heads. 1. Free figure
sculpture, as in the Chapter-house of Salisbury, and very superbly along the west front of
Bourges, the best Gothic spandrils I know. 2. Radiated foliage, more or less referred to the
centre, or to the bottom of the spandril for its origin; single figures with expanded wings
often answering the same purpose. 3. Trefoils; and 4, ordinary wall decoration continued into
the spandril space, as in Plate XIII., above, from St. Pietro at Pistoja, and in Westminster
Abbey. The Renaissance architects introduced spandril fillings composed of colossal human figures
reclining on the sides of the arch, in precarious lassitude; but these cannot come under the
head of wall veil decoration.

§ XI. (2.) The Tympanum. It was noted that, in Gothic architecture, this is for the most part
a detached slab of stone, having no constructional relation to the rest of the building. The
plan of its sculpture is therefore quite arbitrary; and, as it is generally in a conspicuous
position, near the eye, and above the entrance, it is almost always charged with a series of
rich figure sculptures, solemn in feeling and consecutive in subject. It occupies in Christian
sacred edifices very nearly the position of the pediment in Greek sculpture. This latter is
itself a kind of tympanum, and charged with sculpture in the same manner.

§ XII. (3.) The Gable. The same principles apply to it which have been noted respecting the
spandril, with one more of some importance. The chief difficulty in treating a gable lies in
the excessive sharpness of its upper point. It may, indeed, on its outside apex, receive a
finial; but the meeting of the inside lines of its terminal mouldings is necessarily both harsh
and conspicuous, unless artificially concealed. The most beautiful victory I have ever seen
obtained over this difficulty was by placing a sharp shield, its point, as usual, downwards,
at the apex of the gable, which exactly reversed the offensive lines, yet without actually
breaking them; the gable being completed behind the shield. The same thing is done in the Northern
and Southern Gothic: in the porches of Abbeville and the tombs of Verona.

§ XIII. I believe there is little else to be noted of general laws of ornament respecting the
wall veil. We have next to consider its concentration in the shaft.

Now the principal beauty of a shaft is its perfect proportion to its work,--its exact expression
of necessary strength. If this has been truly attained, it will hardly need, in some cases
hardly bear, more decoration than is given to it by its own rounding and taper curvatures;
for, if we cut ornaments in intaglio on its surface, we weaken it; if we leave them in relief,
we overcharge it, and the sweep of the line from its base to its summit, though deduced in
Chapter VIII., from necessities of construction, is already one of gradated curvature, and
of high decorative value.

§ XIV. It is, however, carefully to be noted, that decorations are admissible on colossal and
on diminutive shafts, which are wrong upon those of middle size. For, when the shaft is enormous,
incisions or sculpture on its sides (unless colossal also), do not materially interfere with
the sweep of its curve, nor diminish the efficiency of its sustaining mass. And if it be diminutive,
its sustaining function is comparatively of so small importance, the injurious results of failure
so much less, and the relative strength and cohesion of its mass so much greater, that it may
be suffered in the extravagance of ornament or outline which would be unendurable in a shaft
of middle size, and impossible in one of colossal. Thus, the shafts drawn in Plate XIII., of
the "Seven Lamps," though given as examples of extravagance, are yet pleasing in the general
effect of the arcade they support; being each some six or seven feet high. But they would have
been monstrous, as well as unsafe, if they had been sixty or seventy.

§ XV. Therefore, to determine the general rule for shaft decoration, we must ascertain the
proportions representative of the mean bulk of shafts: they might easily be calculated from
a sufficient number of examples, but it may perhaps be assumed, for our present general purpose,
that the mean standard would be of some twenty feet in height, by eight or nine in circumference:
then this will be the size on which decoration is most difficult and dangerous: and shafts
become more and more fit subjects for decoration, as they rise farther above, or fall farther
beneath it, until very small and very vast shafts will both be found to look blank unless they
receive some chasing or imagery; blank, whether they support a chair or table on the one side,
or sustain a village on the ridge of an Egyptian architrave on the other.

§ XVI. Of the various ornamentation of colossal shafts, there are no examples so noble as the
Egyptian; these the reader can study in Mr. Roberts' work on Egypt nearly as well, I imagine,
as if he were beneath their shadow, one of their chief merits, as examples of method, being
the perfect decision and visibility of their designs at the necessary distance: contrast with
these the incrustations of bas-relief on the Trajan pillar, much interfering with the smooth
lines of the shaft, and yet themselves untraceable, if not invisible.

§ XVII. On shafts of middle size, the only ornament which has ever been accepted as right,
is the Doric fluting, which, indeed, gave the effect of a succession of unequal lines of shade,
but lost much of the repose of the cylindrical gradation. The Corinthian fluting, which is
a mean multiplication and deepening of the Doric, with a square instead of a sharp ridge between
each hollow, destroyed the serenity of the shaft altogether, and is always rigid and meagre.
Both are, in fact, wrong in principle; they are an elaborate weakening[83] of the shaft, exactly
opposed (as above shown) to the ribbed form, which is the result of a group of shafts bound
together, and which is especially beautiful when special service is given to each member.

§ XVIII. On shafts of inferior size, every species of decoration may be wisely lavished, and
in any quantity, so only that the form of the shaft be clearly visible. This I hold to be absolutely
essential, and that barbarism begins wherever the sculpture is either so bossy, or so deeply
cut, as to break the contour of the shaft, or compromise its solidity. Thus, in Plate XXI.
(Appendix 8), the richly sculptured shaft of the lower story has lost its dignity and definite
function, and become a shapeless mass, injurious to the symmetry of the building, though of
some value as adding to its imaginative and fantastic character. Had all the shafts been like
it, the façade would have been entirely spoiled; the inlaid pattern, on the contrary, which
is used on the shortest shaft of the upper story, adds to its preciousness without interfering
with its purpose, and is every way delightful, as are all the inlaid shaft ornaments of this
noble church (another example of them is given in Plate XII. of the "Seven Lamps"). The same
rule would condemn the Caryatid; which I entirely agree with Mr. Fergusson in thinking (both
for this and other reasons) one of the chief errors of the Greek schools; and, more decisively
still, the Renaissance inventions of shaft ornament, almost too absurd and too monstrous to
be seriously noticed, which consist in leaving square blocks between the cylinder joints, as
in the portico of No. 1, Regent Street, and many other buildings in London; or in rusticating
portions of the shafts, or wrapping fleeces about them, as at the entrance of Burlington House,
in Piccadilly; or tying drapery round them in knots, as in the new buildings above noticed
(Chap. 20, § VII.), at Paris. But, within the limits thus defined, there is no feature capable
of richer decoration than the shaft; the most beautiful examples of all I have seen, are the
slender pillars, encrusted with arabesques, which flank the portals of the Baptistery and Duomo
at Pisa, and some others of the Pisan and Lucchese churches; but the varieties of sculpture
and inlaying, with which the small Romanesque shafts, whether Italian or Northern, are adorned
when they occupy important positions, are quite endless, and nearly all admirable. Mr. Digby
Wyatt has given a beautiful example of inlaid work so employed, from the cloisters of the Lateran,
in his work on early mosaic; an example which unites the surface decoration of the shaft with
the adoption of the spiral contour. This latter is often all the decoration which is needed,
and none can be more beautiful; it has been spoken against, like many other good and lovely
things, because it has been too often used in extravagant degrees, like the well-known twisting
of the pillars in Raffaelle's "Beautiful gate." But that extravagant condition was a Renaissance
barbarism: the old Romanesque builders kept their spirals slight and pure; often, as in the
example from St. Zeno, in Plate XVII. below, giving only half a turn from the base of the shaft
to its head, and nearly always observing what I hold to be an imperative law, that no twisted
shaft shall be single, but composed of at least two distinct members, twined with each other.
I suppose they followed their own right feeling in doing this, and had never studied natural
shafts; but the type they might have followed was caught by one of the few great painters who
were not affected by the evil influence of the fifteenth century, Benozzo Gozzoli, who, in
the frescoes of the Ricardi Palace, among stems of trees for the most part as vertical as stone
shafts, has suddenly introduced one of the shape given in Fig. LXII. Many forest trees present,
in their accidental contortions, types of most complicated spiral shafts, the plan being originally
of a grouped shaft rising from several roots; nor, indeed, will the reader ever find models
for every kind of shaft decoration, so graceful or so gorgeous, as he will find in the great
forest aisle, where the strength of the earth itself seems to rise from the roots into the
vaulting; but the shaft surface, barred as it expands with rings of ebony and silver, is fretted
with traceries of ivy, marbled with purple moss, veined with grey lichen, and tesselated, by
the rays of the rolling heaven, with flitting fancies of blue shadow and burning gold.

CHAPTER XXVII.

  THE CORNICE AND CAPITAL.

§ I. There are no features to which the attention of architects has been more laboriously directed,
in all ages, than these crowning members of the wall and shaft; and it would be vain to endeavor,
within any moderate limits, to give the reader any idea of the various kinds of admirable decoration
which have been invented for them. But, in proportion to the effort and straining of the fancy,
have been the extravagances into which it has occasionally fallen; and while it is utterly
impossible severally to enumerate the instances either of its success or its error, it is very
possible to note the limits of the one and the causes of the other. This is all that we shall
attempt in the present chapter, tracing first for ourselves, as in previous instances, the
natural channels by which invention is here to be directed or confined, and afterwards remarking
the places where, in real practice, it has broken bounds.

§ II. The reader remembers, I hope, the main points respecting the cornice and capital, established
above in the Chapters on Construction. Of these I must, however, recapitulate thus much:--

1. That both the cornice and capital are, with reference to the slope of their profile or bell,
to be divided into two great orders; in one of which the ornament is convex, and in the other
concave. (Ch. VI., § V.)

2. That the capital, with reference to the method of twisting the cornice round to construct
it, and to unite the circular shaft with the square abacus, falls into five general forms,
represented in Fig. XXII., p. 119.

3. That the most elaborate capitals were formed by true or simple capitals with a common cornice
added above their abacus. (Ch. IX., § XXIV.)

We have then, in considering decoration, first to observe the treatment of the two great orders
of the cornice; then their gathering into the five of the capital; then the addition of the
secondary cornice to the capital when formed.

§ III. The two great orders or families of cornice were above distinguished in Fig. V., p.
69.; and it was mentioned in the same place that a third family arose from their combination.
We must deal with the two great opposed groups first.

They were distinguished in Fig. V. by circular curves drawn on opposite sides of the same line.
But we now know that in these smaller features the circle is usually the least interesting
curve that we can use; and that it will be well, since the capital and cornice are both active
in their expression, to use some of the more abstract natural lines. We will go back, therefore,
to our old friend the salvia leaf; and taking the same piece of it we had before, x y, Plate
VII., we will apply it to the cornice line; first within it, giving the concave cornice, then
without, giving the convex cornice. In all the figures, a, b, c, d, Plate XV., the dotted line
is at the same slope, and represents an average profile of the root of cornices (a, Fig. V.,
p. 69); the curve of the salvia leaf is applied to it in each case, first with its roundest
curvature up, then with its roundest curvature down; and we have thus the two varieties, a
and b, of the concave family, and c and d, of the convex family.

§ IV. These four profiles will represent all the simple cornices in the world; represent them,
I mean, as central types: for in any of the profiles an infinite number of slopes may be given
to the dotted line of the root (which in these four figures is always at the same angle); and
on each of these innumerable slopes an innumerable variety of curves may be fitted, from every
leaf in the forest, and every shell on the shore, and every movement of the human fingers and
fancy; therefore, if the reader wishes to obtain something like a numerical representation
of the number of possible and beautiful cornices which may be based upon these four types or
roots, and among which the architect has leave to choose according to the circumstances of
his building and the method of its composition, let him set down a figure 1 to begin with,
and write ciphers after it as fast as he can, without stopping, for an hour.

§ V. None of the types are, however, found in perfection of curvature, except in the best work.
Very often cornices are worked with circular segments (with a noble, massive effect, for instance,
in St. Michele of Lucca), or with rude approximation to finer curvature, especially a, Plate
XV., which occurs often so small as to render it useless to take much pains upon its curve.
It occurs perfectly pure in the condition represented by 1 of the series 1-6, in Plate XV.,
on many of the Byzantine and early Gothic buildings of Venice; in more developed form it becomes
the profile of the bell of the capital in the later Venetian Gothic, and in much of the best
Northern Gothic. It also represents the Corinthian capital, in which the curvature is taken
from the bell to be added in some excess to the nodding leaves. It is the most graceful of
all simple profiles of cornice and capital.

§ VI. b is a much rarer and less manageable type: for this evident reason, that while a is
the natural condition of a line rooted and strong beneath, but bent out by superincumbent weight,
or nodding over in freedom, b is yielding at the base and rigid at the summit. It has, however,
some exquisite uses, especially in combination, as the reader may see by glancing in advance
at the inner line of the profile 14 in Plate XV.

§ VII. c is the leading convex or Doric type, as a is the leading concave or Corinthian. Its
relation to the best Greek Doric is exactly what the relation of a is to the Corinthian; that
is to say, the curvature must be taken from the straighter limb of the curve and added to the
bolder bend, giving it a sudden turn inwards (as in the Corinthian a nod outwards), as the
reader may see in the capital of the Parthenon in the British Museum, where the lower limb
of the curve is all but a right line.[84] But these Doric and Corinthian lines are mere varieties
of the great families which are represented by the central lines a and c, including not only
the Doric capital, but all the small cornices formed by a slight increase of the curve of c,
which are of so frequent occurrence in Greek ornaments.

§ VIII. d is the Christian Doric, which I said (Chap. I., § XX.) was invented to replace the
antique: it is the representative of the great Byzantine and Norman families of convex cornice
and capital, and, next to the profile a, the most important of the four, being the best profile
for the convex capital, as a is for the concave; a being the best expression of an elastic
line inserted vertically in the shaft, and d of an elastic line inserted horizontally and rising
to meet vertical pressure.

If the reader will glance at the arrangements of boughs of trees, he will find them commonly
dividing into these two families, a and d: they rise out of the trunk and nod from it as a,
or they spring with sudden curvature out from it, and rise into sympathy with it, as at d;
but they only accidentally display tendencies to the lines b or c. Boughs which fall as they
spring from the tree also describe the curve d in the plurality of instances, but reversed
in arrangement; their junction with the stem being at the top of it, their sprays bending out
into rounder curvature.

§ IX. These then being the two primal groups, we have next to note the combined group, formed
by the concave and convex lines joined in various proportions of curvature, so as to form together
the reversed or ogee curve, represented in one of its most beautiful states by the glacier
line a, on Plate VII. I would rather have taken this line than any other to have formed my
third group of cornices by, but as it is too large, and almost too delicate, we will take instead
that of the Matterhorn side, e f, Plate VII. For uniformity's sake I keep the slope of the
dotted line the same as in the primal forms; and applying this Matterhorn curve in its four
relative positions to that line, I have the types of the four cornices or capitals of the third
family, e, f, g, h, on Plate XV.

These are, however, general types only thus far, that their line is composed of one short and
one long curve, and that they represent the four conditions of treatment of every such line;
namely, the longest curve concave in e and f, and convex in g and h; and the point of contrary
flexure set high in e and g, and low in f and h. The relative depth of the arcs, or nature
of their curvature, cannot be taken into consideration without a complexity of system which
my space does not admit.

Of the four types thus constituted, e and f are of great importance; the other two are rarely
used, having an appearance of weakness in consequence of the shortest curve being concave:
the profiles e and f, when used for cornices, have usually a fuller sweep and somewhat greater
equality between the branches of the curve; but those here given are better representatives
of the structure applicable to capitals and cornices indifferently.

§ X. Very often, in the farther treatment of the profiles e or f, another limb is added to
their curve in order to join it to the upper or lower members of the cornice or capital. I
do not consider this addition as forming another family of cornices, because the leading and
effective part of the curve is in these, as in the others, the single ogee; and the added bend
is merely a less abrupt termination of it above or below: still this group is of so great importance
in the richer kinds of ornamentation that we must have it sufficiently represented. We shall
obtain a type of it by merely continuing the line of the Matterhorn side, of which before we
took only a fragment. The entire line e to g on Plate VII., is evidently composed of three
curves of unequal lengths, which if we call the shortest 1, the intermediate one 2, and the
longest 3, are there arranged in the order 1, 3, 2, counting upwards. But evidently we might
also have had the arrangements 1, 2, 3, and 2, 1, 3, giving us three distinct lines, altogether
independent of position, which being applied to one general dotted slope will each give four
cornices, or twelve altogether. Of these the six most important are those which have the shortest
curve convex: they are given in light relief from k to p, Plate XV., and, by turning the page
upside down, the other six will be seen in dark relief, only the little upright bits of shadow
at the bottom are not to be considered as parts of them, being only admitted in order to give
the complete profile of the more important cornices in light.

§ XI. In these types, as in e and f, the only general condition is, that their line shall be
composed of three curves of different lengths and different arrangements (the depth of arcs
and radius of curvatures being unconsidered). They are arranged in three couples, each couple
being two positions of the same entire line; so that numbering the component curves in order
of magnitude and counting upwards, they will read--

  k 1, 2, 3,
  l 3, 2, 1,
  m 1, 3, 2,
  n 2, 3, 1,
  o 2, 1, 3,
  p 3, 1, 2.

m and n, which are the Matterhorn line, are the most beautiful and important of all the twelve;
k and l the next; o and p are used only for certain conditions of flower carving on the surface.
The reverses (dark) of k and l are also of considerable service; the other four hardly ever
used in good work.

§ XII. If we were to add a fourth curve to the component series, we should have forty-eight
more cornices: but there is no use in pursuing the system further, as such arrangements are
very rare and easily resolved into the simpler types with certain arbitrary additions fitted
to their special place; and, in most cases, distinctly separate from the main curve, as in
the inner line of No. 14, which is a form of the type e, the longest curve, i.e., the lowest,
having deepest curvature, and each limb opposed by a short contrary curve at its extremities,
the convex limb by a concave, the concave by a convex.

§ XIII. Such, then, are the great families of profile lines into which all cornices and capitals
may be divided; but their best examples unite two such profiles in a mode which we cannot understand
till we consider the further ornament with which the profiles are charged. And in doing this
we must, for the sake of clearness, consider, first the nature of the designs themselves, and
next the mode of cutting them.

§ XIV. In Plate XVI., opposite, I have thrown together a few of the most characteristic mediæval
examples of the treatment of the simplest cornice profiles: the uppermost, a, is the pure root
of cornices from St. Mark's. The second, d, is the Christian Doric cornice, here lettered d
in order to avoid confusion, its profile being d of Plate XV. in bold development, and here
seen on the left-hand side, truly drawn, though filled up with the ornament to show the mode
in which the angle is turned. This is also from St. Mark's. The third, b, is b of Plate XV.,
the pattern being inlaid in black because its office was in the interior of St. Mark's, where
it was too dark to see sculptured ornament at the required distance. (The other two simple
profiles, a and c of Plate XV., would be decorated in the same manner, but require no example
here, for the profile a is of so frequent occurrence that it will have a page to itself alone
in the next volume; and c may be seen over nearly every shop in London, being that of the common
Greek egg cornice.) The fourth, e in Plate XVI., is a transitional cornice, passing from Byzantine
into Venetian Gothic: f is a fully developed Venetian Gothic cornice founded on Byzantine traditions;
and g the perfect Lombardic-Gothic cornice, founded on the Pisan Romanesque traditions, and
strongly marked with the noblest Northern element, the Lombardic vitality restrained by classical
models. I consider it a perfect cornice, and of the highest order.

§ XV. Now in the design of this series of ornaments there are two main points to be noted;
the first, that they all, except b, are distinctly rooted in the lower part of the cornice,
and spring to the top. This arrangement is constant in all the best cornices and capitals;
and it is essential to the expression of the supporting power of both. It is exactly opposed
to the system of running cornices and banded[85] capitals, in which the ornament flows along
them horizontally, or is twined round them, as the mouldings are in the early English capital,
and the foliage in many decorated ones. Such cornices have arisen from a mistaken appliance
of the running ornaments, which are proper to archivolts, jambs, &c., to the features which
have definite functions of support. A tendril may nobly follow the outline of an arch, but
must not creep along a cornice, nor swathe or bandage a capital; it is essential to the expression
of these features that their ornament should have an elastic and upward spring; and as the
proper profile for the curve is that of a tree bough, as we saw above, so the proper arrangement
of its farther ornament is that which best expresses rooted and ascendant strength like that
of foliage.

There are certain very interesting exceptions to the rule (we shall see a curious one presently);
and in the carrying out of the rule itself, we may see constant licenses taken by the great
designers, and momentary violations of it, like those above spoken of, respecting other ornamental
laws--violations which are for our refreshment, and for increase of delight in the general
observance; and this is one of the peculiar beauties of the cornice g, which, rooting itself
in strong central clusters, suffers some of its leaves to fall languidly aside, as the drooping
outer leaves of a natural cluster do so often; but at the very instant that it does this, in
order that it may not lose any of its expression of strength, a fruit-stalk is thrown up above
the languid leaves, absolutely vertical, as much stiffer and stronger than the rest of the
plant as the falling leaves are weaker. Cover this with your finger, and the cornice falls
to pieces, like a bouquet which has been untied.

§ XVI. There are some instances in which, though the real arrangement is that of a running
stem, throwing off leaves up and down, the positions of the leaves give nearly as much elasticity
and organisation to the cornice, as if they had been rightly rooted; and others, like b, where
the reversed portion of the ornament is lost in the shade, and the general expression of strength
is got by the lower member. This cornice will, nevertheless, be felt at once to be inferior
to the rest; and though we may often be called upon to admire designs of these kinds, which
would have been exquisite if not thus misplaced, the reader will find that they are both of
rare occurrence, and significative of declining style; while the greater mass of the banded
capitals are heavy and valueless, mere aggregations of confused sculpture, swathed round the
extremity of the shaft, as if she had dipped it into a mass of melted ornament, as the glass-blower
does his blow-pipe into the metal, and brought up a quantity adhering glutinously to its extremity.
We have many capitals of this kind in England: some of the worst and heaviest in the choir
of York. The later capitals of the Italian Gothic have the same kind of effect, but owing to
another cause: for their structure is quite pure, and based on the Corinthian type: and it
is the branching form of the heads of the leaves which destroys the effect of their organisation.
On the other hand, some of the Italian cornices which are actually composed by running tendrils,
throwing off leaves into oval interstices, are so massive in their treatment, and so marked
and firm in their vertical and arched lines, that they are nearly as suggestive of support
as if they had been arranged on the rooted system. A cornice of this kind is used in St. Michele
of Lucca (Plate VI. in the "Seven Lamps," and XXI. here), and with exquisite propriety; for
that cornice is at once a crown to the story beneath it and a foundation to that which is above
it, and therefore unites the strength and elasticity of the lines proper to the cornice with
the submission and prostration of those proper to the foundation.

§ XVII. This, then, is the first point needing general notice in the designs in Plate XVI.
The second is the difference between the freedom of the Northern and the sophistication of
the classical cornices, in connection with what has been advanced in Appendix 8. The cornices,
a, d, and b, are of the same date, but they show a singular difference in the workman's temper:
that at b is a single copy of a classical mosaic; and many carved cornices occur, associated
with it, which are, in like manner, mere copies of the Greek and Roman egg and arrow mouldings.
But the cornices a and d are copies of nothing of the kind: the idea of them has indeed been
taken from the Greek honeysuckle ornament, but the chiselling of them is in no wise either
Greek, or Byzantine, in temper. The Byzantines were languid copyists: this work is as energetic
as its original; energetic, not in the quantity of work, but in the spirit of it: an indolent
man, forced into toil, may cover large spaces with evidence of his feeble action, or accumulate
his dulness into rich aggregation of trouble, but it is gathered weariness still. The man who
cut those two uppermost cornices had no time to spare: did as much cornice as he could in half
an hour; but would not endure the slightest trace of error in a curve, or of bluntness in an
edge. His work is absolutely unreproveable; keen, and true, as Nature's own; his entire force
is in it, and fixed on seeing that every line of it shall be sharp and right: the faithful
energy is in him: we shall see something come of that cornice: The fellow who inlaid the other
(b), will stay where he is for ever; and when he has inlaid one leaf up, will inlay another
down,--and so undulate up and down to all eternity: but the man of a and d will cut his way
forward, or there is no truth in handicrafts, nor stubbornness in stone.

§ XVIII. But there is something else noticeable in those two cornices, besides the energy of
them: as opposed either to b, or the Greek honeysuckle or egg patterns, they are natural designs.
The Greek egg and arrow cornice is a nonsense cornice, very noble in its lines, but utterly
absurd in meaning. Arrows have had nothing to do with eggs (at least since Leda's time), neither
are the so-called arrows like arrows, nor the eggs like eggs, nor the honeysuckles like honeysuckles;
they are all conventionalised into a monotonous successiveness of nothing,--pleasant to the
eye, useless to the thought. But those Christian cornices are, as far as may be, suggestive;
there is not the tenth of the work in them that there is in the Greek arrows, but, as far as
that work will go, it has consistent intention; with the fewest possible incisions, and those
of the easiest shape, they suggest the true image, of clusters of leaves, each leaf with its
central depression from root to point, and that distinctly visible at almost any distance from
the eye, and in almost any light.

§ XIX. Here, then, are two great new elements visible; energy and naturalism:--Life, with submission
to the laws of God, and love of his works; this is Christianity, dealing with her classical
models. Now look back to what I said in Chap. 1. § XX. of this dealing of hers, and invention
of the new Doric line; then to what is above stated (§ VIII.) respecting that new Doric, and
the boughs of trees; and now to the evidence in the cutting of the leaves on the same Doric
section, and see how the whole is beginning to come together.

§ XX. We said that something would come of these two cornices, a and d. In e and f we see that
something has come of them: e is also from St. Mark's, and one of the earliest examples in
Venice of the transition from the Byzantine to the Gothic cornice. It is already singularly
developed; flowers have been added between the clusters of leaves, and the leaves themselves
curled over: and observe the well-directed thought of the sculptor in this curling;--the old
incisions are retained below, and their excessive rigidity is one of the proofs of the earliness
of the cornice; but those incisions now stand for the under surface of the leaf; and behold,
when it turns over, on the top of it you see true ribs. Look at the upper and under surface
of a cabbage-leaf, and see what quick steps we are making.

§ XXI. The fifth example (f) was cut in 1347; it is from the tomb of Marco Giustiniani, in
the church of St. John and Paul, and it exhibits the character of the central Venetian Gothic
fully developed. The lines are all now soft and undulatory, though elastic; the sharp incisions
have become deeply-gathered folds; the hollow of the leaf is expressed completely beneath,
and its edges are touched with light, and incised into several lobes, and their ribs delicately
drawn above. (The flower between is only accidentally absent; it occurs in most cornices of
the time.)

But in both these cornices the reader will notice that while the naturalism of the sculpture
is steadily on the increase, the classical formalism is still retained. The leaves are accurately
numbered, and sternly set in their places; they are leaves in office, and dare not stir nor
wave. They have the shapes of leaves, but not the functions, "having the form of knowledge,
but denying the power thereof." What is the meaning of this?

§ XXII. Look back to the XXXIIIrd paragraph of the first chapter, and you will see the meaning
of it. These cornices are the Venetian Ecclesiastical Gothic; the Christian element struggling
with the Formalism of the Papacy,--the Papacy being entirely heathen in all its principles.
That officialism of the leaves and their ribs means Apostolic succession, and I don't know
how much more, and is already preparing for the transition to old Heathenism again, and the
Renaissance.[86]

§ XXIII. Now look to the last cornice (g). That is Protestantism,--a slight touch of Dissent,
hardly amounting to schism, in those falling leaves, but true life in the whole of it. The
forms all broken through, and sent heaven knows where, but the root held fast; and the strong
sap in the branches; and, best of all, good fruit ripening and opening straight towards heaven,
and in the face of it, even though some of the leaves lie in the dust.

Now, observe. The cornice f represents Heathenism and Papistry, animated by the mingling of
Christianity and nature. The good in it, the life of it, the veracity and liberty of it, such
as it has, are Protestantism in its heart; the rigidity and saplessness are the Romanism of
it. It is the mind of Fra Angelico in the monk's dress,--Christianity before the Reformation.
The cornice g has the Lombardic life element in its fulness, with only some color and shape
of Classicalism mingled with it--the good of classicalism; as much method and Formalism as
are consistent with life, and fitting for it: The continence within certain border lines, the
unity at the root, the simplicity of the great profile,--all these are the healthy classical
elements retained: the rest is reformation, new strength, and recovered liberty.

§ XXIV. There is one more point about it especially noticeable. The leaves are thoroughly natural
in their general character, but they are of no particular species: and after being something
like cabbage-leaves in the beginning, one of them suddenly becomes an ivy-leaf in the end.
Now I don't know what to say of this. I know it, indeed, to be a classical character;--it is
eminently characteristic of Southern work; and markedly distinctive of it from the Northern
ornament, which would have been oak, or ivy, or apple, but not anything, nor two things in
one. It is, I repeat, a clearly classical element; but whether a good or bad element, I am
not sure;--whether it is the last trace of Centaurism and other monstrosity dying away; or
whether it has a figurative purpose, legitimate in architecture (though never in painting),
and has been rightly retained by the Christian sculptor, to express the working of that spirit
which grafts one nature upon another, and discerns a law in its members warring against the
law of its mind.

§ XXV. These, then, being the points most noticeable in the spirit both of the designs and
the chiselling, we have now to return to the question proposed in § XIII., and observe the
modifications of form of profile which resulted from the changing contours of the leafage;
for up to § XIII., we had, as usual, considered the possible conditions of form in the abstract;--the
modes in which they have been derived from each other in actual practice require to be followed
in their turn. How the Greek Doric or Greek ogee cornices were invented is not easy to determine,
and, fortunately, is little to our present purpose; for the mediæval ogee cornices have an
independent development of their own, from the first type of the concave cornice a in Plate XV.

§ XXVI. That cornice occurs, in the simplest work, perfectly pure, but in finished work it
was quickly felt that there was a meagreness in its junction with the wall beneath it, where
it was set as here at a, Fig. LXIII., which could only be conquered by concealing such junction
in a bar of shadow. There were two ways of getting this bar: one by a projecting roll at the
foot of the cornice (b, Fig. LXIII.), the other by slipping the whole cornice a little forward
(c. Fig. LXIII.). From these two methods arise two groups of cornices and capitals, which we
shall pursue in succession.

§ XXVII. First group. With the roll at the base (b, Fig. LXIII.). The chain of its succession
is represented from 1 to 6, in Plate XV.: 1 and 2 are the steps already gained, as in Fig.
LXIII.; and in them the profile of cornice used is a of Plate XV., or a refined condition of
b of Fig. V., p. 69, above. Now, keeping the same refined profile, substitute the condition
of it, f of Fig. V. (and there accounted for), above the roll here, and you have 3, Plate XV.
This superadded abacus was instantly felt to be harsh in its projecting angle; but you know
what to do with an angle when it is harsh. Use your simplest chamfer on it (a or b, Fig. LIII.,
page 287, above), but on the visible side only, and you have fig. 4, Plate XV. (the top stone
being made deeper that you may have room to chamfer it). Now this fig. 4 is the profile of
Lombardic and Venetian early capitals and cornices, by tens of thousands; and it continues
into the late Venetian Gothic, with this only difference, that as times advances, the vertical
line at the top of the original cornice begins to slope outwards, and through a series of years
rises like the hazel wand in the hand of a diviner:--but how slowly! a stone dial which marches
but 45 degrees in three centuries, and through the intermediate condition 5 arrives at 6, and
so stays.

In tracing this chain I have kept all the profiles of the same height in order to make the
comparison more easy; the depth chosen is about intermediate between that which is customary
in cornices on the one hand, which are often a little shorter, and capitals on the other, which
are often a little deeper.[87] And it is to be noted that the profiles 5 and 6 establish themselves
in capitals chiefly, while 4 is retained in cornices to the latest times.

§ XXVIII. Second group (c, Fig. LXIII.). If the lower angle, which was quickly felt to be hard,
be rounded off, we have the form a, Fig. LXIV. The front of the curved line is then decorated,
as we have seen; and the termination of the decorated surface marked by an incision, as in
an ordinary chamfer, as at b here. This I believe to have been the simple origin of most of
the Venetian ogee cornices; but they are farther complicated by the curves given to the leafage
which flows over them. In the ordinary Greek cornices, and in a and d of Plate XVI., the decoration
is incised from the outside profile, without any suggestion of an interior surface of a different
contour. But in the leaf cornices which follow, the decoration is represented as overlaid on
one of the early profiles, and has another outside contour of its own; which is, indeed, the
true profile of the cornice, but beneath which, more or less, the simpler profile is seen or
suggested, which terminates all the incisions of the chisel. This under profile will often
be found to be some condition of the type a or b, Fig. LXIV.; and the leaf profile to be another
ogee with its fullest curve up instead of down, lapping over the cornice edge above, so that
the entire profile might be considered as made up of two ogee curves laid, like packed herrings,
head to tail. Figures 8 and 9 of Plate XV. exemplify this arrangement. Fig. 7 is a heavier
contour, doubtless composed in the same manner, but of which I had not marked the innermost
profile, and which I have given here only to complete the series which, from 7 to 12 inclusive,
exemplifies the gradual restriction of the leaf outline, from its boldest projection in the
cornice to its most modest service in the capital. This change, however, is not one which indicates
difference of age, but merely of office and position: the cornice 7 is from the tomb of the
Doge Andrea Dandolo (1350) in St. Mark's, 8 from a canopy over a door of about the same period,
9 from the tomb of the Dogaressa Agnese Venier (1411), 10 from that of Pietro Cornaro (1361),[88]
and 11 from that of Andrea Morosini (1347), all in the church of San Giov. and Paola, all these
being cornice profiles; and, finally, 12 from a capital of the Ducal Palace, of fourteen century
work.

§ XXIX. Now the reader will doubtless notice that in the three examples, 10 to 12, the leaf
has a different contour from that of 7, 8, or 9. This difference is peculiarly significant.
I have always desired that the reader should theoretically consider the capital as a concentration
of the cornice; but in practice it often happens that the cornice is, on the contrary, an unrolled
capital; and one of the richest early forms of the Byzantine cornice (not given in Plate XV.,
because its separate character and importance require examination apart) is nothing more than
an unrolled continuation of the lower range of acanthus leaves on the Corinthian capital. From
this cornice others appear to have been derived, like e in Plate XVI., in which the acanthus
outline has become confused with that of the honeysuckle, and the rosette of the centre of
the Corinthian capital introduced between them; and thus their forms approach more and more
to those derived from the cornice itself. Now if the leaf has the contour of 10, 11, or 12,
Plate XV., the profile is either actually of a capital, or of a cornice derived from a capital;
while, if the leaf have the contour of 7 or 8, the profile is either actually of a cornice
or of a capital derived from a cornice. Where the Byzantines use the acanthus, the Lombards
use the Persepolitan water-leaf; but the connection of the cornices and capitals is exactly
the same.

§ XXX. Thus far, however, we have considered the characters of profile which are common to
the cornice and capital both. We have now to note what farther decorative features or peculiarities
belong to the capital itself, or result from the theoretical gathering of the one into the other.

Look back to Fig. XXII., p. 110. The five types there given, represented the five different
methods of concentration of the root of cornices, a of Fig. V. Now, as many profiles of cornices
as were developed in Plate XV. from this cornice root, there represented by the dotted slope,
so many may be applied to each of the five types in Fig. XXII.,--applied simply in a and b,
but with farther modifications, necessitated by their truncations or spurs, in c, d, and e.

Then, these cornice profiles having been so applied in such length and slope as is proper for
capitals, the farther condition comes into effect described in Chapter IX. § XXIV., and any
one of the cornices in Plate XV. may become the abacus of a capital formed out of any other,
or out of itself. The infinity of forms thus resultant cannot, as may well be supposed, be
exhibited or catalogued in the space at present permitted to us: but the reader, once master
of the principle, will easily be able to investigate for himself the syntax of all examples
that may occur to him, and I shall only here, as a kind of exercise, put before him a few of
those which he will meet with most frequently in his Venetian inquiries, or which illustrate
points, not hitherto touched upon, in the disposition of the abacus.

§ XXXI. In Plate XVII. the capital at the top, on the left hand, is the rudest possible gathering
of the plain Christian Doric cornice, d of Plate XV. The shaft is octagonal, and the capital
is not cut to fit it, but is square at the base; and the curve of its profile projects on two
of its sides more than on the other two, so as to make the abacus oblong, in order to carry
an oblong mass of brickwork, dividing one of the upper lights of a Lombard campanile at Milan.
The awkward stretching of the brickwork, to do what the capital ought to have done, is very
remarkable. There is here no second superimposed abacus.

§ XXXII. The figure on the right hand, at the top, shows the simple but perfect fulfilment
of all the requirements in which the first example fails. The mass of brickwork to be carried
is exactly the same in size and shape; but instead of being trusted to a single shaft, it has
two of smaller area (compare Chap. VIII., § XIII.), and all the expansion necessary is now
gracefully attained by their united capitals, hewn out of one stone. Take the section of these
capitals through their angle, and nothing can be simpler or purer; it is composed of 2, in
Plate XV., used for the capital itself, with c of Fig. LXIII. used for the abacus; the reader
could hardly have a neater little bit of syntax for a first lesson. If the section be taken
through the side of the bell, the capital profile is the root of cornices, a of Fig. V., with
the added roll. This capital is somewhat remarkable in having its sides perfectly straight,
some slight curvature being usual on so bold a scale; but it is all the better as a first example,
the method of reduction being of order d, in Fig. XXII., p. 110, and with a concave cut, as
in Fig. XXI., p. 109. These two capitals are from the cloister of the duomo of Verona.

§ XXXIII. The lowermost figure in Plate XVII. represents an exquisitely finished example of
the same type, from St. Zeno of Verona. Above, at 2, in Plate II., the plan of the shafts was
given, but I inadvertently reversed their position: in comparing that plan with Plate XVII.,
Plate II. must be held upside down. The capitals, with the band connecting them, are all cut
out of one block; their profile is an adaptation of 4 of Plate XV., with a plain headstone
superimposed. This method of reduction is that of order d in Fig. XXII., but the peculiarity
of treatment of their truncation is highly interesting. Fig. LXV. represents the plans of the
capitals at the base, the shaded parts being the bells: the open line, the roll with its connecting
band. The bell of the one, it will be seen, is the exact reverse of that of the other: the
angle truncations are, in both, curved horizontally as well as uprightly; but their curve is
convex in the one, and in the other concave. Plate XVII. will show the effect of both, with
the farther incisions, to the same depth, on the flank of the one with the concave truncation,
which join with the rest of its singularly bold and keen execution in giving the impression
of its rather having been cloven into its form by the sweeps of a sword, than by the dull travail
of a chisel. Its workman was proud of it, as well he might be: he has written his name upon
its front (I would that more of his fellows had been as kindly vain), and the goodly stone
proclaims for ever, ADAMINUS DE SANCTO GIORGIO ME FECIT.

§ XXXIV. The reader will easily understand that the gracefulness of this kind of truncation,
as he sees it in Plate XVII., soon suggested the idea of reducing it to a vegetable outline,
and laying four healing leaves, as it were, upon the wounds which the sword had made. These
four leaves, on the truncations of the capital, correspond to the four leaves which we saw,
in like manner, extend themselves over the spurs of the base, and, as they increase in delicacy
of execution, form one of the most lovely groups of capitals which the Gothic workmen ever
invented; represented by two perfect types in the capitals of the Piazzetta columns of Venice.
But this pure group is an isolated one; it remains in the first simplicity of its conception
far into the thirteenth century, while around it rise up a crowd of other forms, imitative
of the old Corinthian, and in which other and younger leaves spring up in luxuriant growth
among the primal four. The varieties of their grouping we shall enumerate hereafter: one general
characteristic of them all must be noted here.

§ XXXV. The reader has been told repeatedly[89] that there are two, and only two, real orders
of capitals, originally represented by the Corinthian and the Doric; and distinguished by the
concave or convex contours of their bells, as shown by the dotted lines at e, Fig. V., p. 65.
And hitherto, respecting the capital, we have been exclusively concerned with the methods in
which these two families of simple contours have gathered themselves together, and obtained
reconciliation to the abacus above, and the shaft below. But the last paragraph introduces
us to the surface ornament disposed upon these, in the chiselling of which the characters described
above, § XXVIII., which are but feebly marked in the cornice, boldly distinguish and divide
the families of the capital.

§ XXXVI. Whatever the nature of the ornament be, it must clearly have relief of some kind,
and must present projecting surfaces separated by incisions. But it is a very material question
whether the contour, hitherto broadly considered as that of the entire bell, shall be that
of the outside of the projecting and relieved ornaments, or of the bottoms of the incisions
which divide them; whether, that is to say, we shall first cut out the bell of our capital
quite smooth, and then cut farther into it, with incisions, which shall leave ornamental forms
in relief, or whether, in originally cutting the contour of the bell, we shall leave projecting
bits of stone, which we may afterwards work into the relieved ornament.

§ XXXVII. Now, look back to Fig. V., p. 65. Clearly, if to ornament the already hollowed profile,
b, we cut deep incisions into it, we shall so far weaken it at the top, that it will nearly
lose all its supporting power. Clearly, also, if to ornament the already bulging profile c
we were to leave projecting pieces of stone outside of it, we should nearly destroy all its
relation to the original sloping line X, and produce an unseemly and ponderous mass, hardly
recognizable as a cornice profile. It is evident, on the other hand, that we can afford to
cut into this profile without fear of destroying its strength, and that we can afford to leave
projections outside of the other, without fear of destroying its lightness. Such is, accordingly,
the natural disposition of the sculpture, and the two great families of capitals are therefore
distinguished, not merely by their concave and convex contours, but by the ornamentation being
left outside the bell of the one, and cut into the bell of the other; so that, in either case,
the ornamental portions will fall between the dotted lines at e, Fig. V., and the pointed oval,
or vesica piscis, which is traced by them, may be called the Limit of ornamentation.

§ XXXVIII. Several distinctions in the quantity and style of the ornament must instantly follow
from this great distinction in its position. First, in its quantity. For, observe: since in
the Doric profile, c of Fig. V., the contour itself is to be composed of the surface of the
ornamentation, this ornamentation must be close and united enough to form, or at least suggest,
a continuous surface; it must, therefore, be rich in quantity and close in aggregation; otherwise
it will destroy the massy character of the profile it adorns, and approximate it to its opposite,
the concave. On the other hand, the ornament left projecting from the concave, must be sparing
enough, and dispersed enough, to allow the concave bell to be clearly seen beneath it; otherwise
it will choke up the concave profile, and approximate it to its opposite, the convex.

§ XXXIX. And, secondly, in its style. For, clearly, as the sculptor of the concave profile
must leave masses of rough stone prepared for his outer ornament, and cannot finish them at
once, but must complete the cutting of the smooth bell beneath first, and then return to the
projecting masses (for if he were to finish these latter first, they would assuredly, if delicate
or sharp, be broken as he worked on; since, I say, he must work in this foreseeing and predetermined
method, he is sure to reduce the system of his ornaments to some definite symmetrical order
before he begins); and the habit of conceiving beforehand all that he has to do, will probably
render him not only more orderly in its arrangement, but more skilful and accurate in its execution,
than if he could finish all as he worked on. On the other hand, the sculptor of the convex
profile has its smooth surface laid before him, as a piece of paper on which he can sketch
at his pleasure; the incisions he makes in it are like touches of a dark pencil; and he is
at liberty to roam over the surface in perfect freedom, with light incisions or with deep;
finishing here, suggesting there, or perhaps in places leaving the surface altogether smooth.
It is ten to one, therefore, but that, if he yield to the temptation, he becomes irregular
in design, and rude in handling; and we shall assuredly find the two families of capitals distinguished,
the one by its symmetrical, thoroughly organised, and exquisitely executed ornament, the other
by its rambling, confused, and rudely chiselled ornament: But, on the other hand, while we
shall often have to admire the disciplined precision of the one, and as often to regret the
irregular rudeness of the other, we shall not fail to find balancing qualities in both. The
severity of the disciplinarian capital represses the power of the imagination; it gradually
degenerates into Formalism; and the indolence which cannot escape from its stern demand of
accurate workmanship, seeks refuge in copyism of established forms, and loses itself at last
in lifeless mechanism. The license of the other, though often abused, permits full exercise
to the imagination: the mind of the sculptor, unshackled by the niceties of chiselling, wanders
over its orbed field in endless fantasy; and, when generous as well as powerful, repays the
liberty which has been granted to it with interest, by developing through the utmost wildness
and fulness of its thoughts, an order as much more noble than the mechanical symmetry of the
opponent school, as the domain which it regulates is vaster.

§ XL. And now the reader shall judge whether I had not reason to cast aside the so-called Five
orders of the Renaissance architects, with their volutes and fillets, and to tell him that
there were only two real orders, and that there could never be more.[90] For we now find that
these two great and real orders are representative of the two great influences which must for
ever divide the heart of man: the one of Lawful Discipline, with its perfection and order,
but its danger of degeneracy into Formalism; the other of Lawful Freedom, with its vigor and
variety, but its danger of degeneracy into Licentiousness.

§ XLI. I shall not attempt to give any illustrations here of the most elaborate developments
of either order; they will be better given on a larger scale: but the examples in Plate XVII.
and XVIII. represent the two methods of ornament in their earliest appliance. The two lower
capitals in Plate XVII. are a pure type of the concave school; the two in the centre of Plate
XVIII., of the convex. At the top of Plate XVIII. are two Lombardic capitals; that on the left
from Sta. Sofia at Padua, that on the right from the cortile of St. Ambrogio at Milan. They
both have the concave angle truncation; but being of date prior to the time when the idea of
the concave bell was developed, they are otherwise left square, and decorated with the surface
ornament characteristic of the convex school. The relation of the designs to each other is
interesting; the cross being prominent in the centre of each, but more richly relieved in that
from St. Ambrogio. The two beneath are from the southern portico of St. Mark's; the shafts
having been of different lengths, and neither, in all probability, originally intended for
their present place, they have double abaci, of which the uppermost is the cornice running
round the whole façade. The zigzagged capital is highly curious, and in its place very effective
and beautiful, although one of the exceptions which it was above noticed that we should sometimes
find to the law stated in § XV. above.

§ XLII. The lower capital, which is also of the true convex school, exhibits one of the conditions
of the spurred type, e of Fig. XXII., respecting which one or two points must be noticed.

If we were to take up the plan of the simple spur, represented at e in Fig. XXII., p. 110,
and treat it, with the salvia leaf, as we did the spur of the base, we should have for the
head of our capital a plan like Fig. LXVI., which is actually that of one of the capitals of
the Fondaco de' Turchi at Venice; with this only difference, that the intermediate curves between
the spurs would have been circular: the reason they are not so, here, is that the decoration,
instead of being confined to the spur, is now spread over the whole mass, and contours are
therefore given to the intermediate curves which fit them for this ornament; the inside shaded
space being the head of the shaft, and the outer, the abacus. The reader has in Fig. LXVI.
a characteristic type of the plans of the spurred capitals, generally preferred by the sculptors
of the convex school, but treated with infinite variety, the spurs often being cut into animal
forms, or the incisions between them multiplied, for richer effect; and in our own Norman capital
the type c of Fig. XXII. is variously subdivided by incisions on its slope, approximating in
general effect to many conditions of the real spurred type, e, but totally differing from them
in principle.

§ XLIII. The treatment of the spur in the concave school is far more complicated, being borrowed
in nearly every case from the original Corinthian. Its plan may be generally represented by
Fig. LXVII. The spur itself is carved into a curling tendril or concave leaf, which supports
the projecting angle of a four-sided abacus, whose hollow sides fall back behind the bell,
and have generally a rosette or other ornament in their centres. The mediæval architects often
put another square abacus above all, as represented by the shaded portion of Fig. LXVII., and
some massy conditions of this form, elaborately ornamented, are very beautiful; but it is apt
to become rigid and effeminate, as assuredly it is in the original Corinthian, which is thoroughly
mean and meagre in its upper tendrils and abacus.

§ XLIV. The lowest capital in Plate XVIII. is from St. Mark's, and singular in having double
spurs; it is therefore to be compared with the doubly spurred base, also from St Mark's, in
Plate XI. In other respects it is a good example of the union of breadth of mass with subtlety
of curvature, which characterises nearly all the spurred capitals of the convex school. Its
plan is given in Fig. LXVIII.: the inner shaded circle is the head of the shaft; the white
cross, the bottom of the capital, which expands itself into the external shaded portions at
the top. Each spur, thus formed, is cut like a ship's bow, with the Doric profile; the surfaces
so obtained are then charged with arborescent ornament.

§ XLV. I shall not here farther exemplify the conditions of the treatment of the spur, because
I am afraid of confusing the reader's mind, and diminishing the distinctness of his conception
of the differences between the two great orders, which it has been my principal object to develope
throughout this chapter. If all my readers lived in London, I could at once fix this difference
in their minds by a simple, yet somewhat curious illustration. In many parts of the west end
of London, as, for instance, at the corners of Belgrave Square, and the north side of Grosvenor
Square, the Corinthian capitals of newly-built houses are put into cages of wire. The wire
cage is the exact form of the typical capital of the convex school; the Corinthian capital,
within, is a finished and highly decorated example of the concave. The space between the cage
and capital is the limit of ornamentation.

§ XLVI. Those of my readers, however, to whom this illustration is inaccessible, must be content
with the two profiles, 13 and 14, on Plate XV. If they will glance along the line of sections
from 1 to 6, they will see that the profile 13 is their final development, with a superadded
cornice for its abacus. It is taken from a capital in a very important ruin of a palace, near
the Rialto of Venice, and hereafter to be described; the projection, outside of its principal
curve, is the profile of its superadded leaf ornamentation; it may be taken as one of the simplest,
yet a perfect type of the concave group.

§ XLVII. The profile 14 is that of the capital of the main shaft of the northern portico of
St. Mark's, the most finished example I ever met with of the convex family, to which, in spite
of the central inward bend of its profile, it is marked as distinctly belonging, by the bold
convex curve at its root, springing from the shaft in the line of the Christian Doric cornice,
and exactly reversing the structure of the other profile, which rises from the shaft, like
a palm leaf from its stem. (1 Kings, vii. 17, 19.)

§ XLVIII. On this exquisite capital there is imposed an abacus of the profile with which we
began our investigation long ago, the profile a of Fig. V. This abacus is formed by the cornice
already given, a, of Plate XVI.: and therefore we have, in this lovely Venetian capital, the
summary of the results of our investigation, from its beginning to its close: the type of the
first cornice; the decoration of it, in its emergence from the classical models; the gathering
into the capital; the superimposition of the secondary cornice, and the refinement of the bell
of the capital by triple curvature in the two limits of chiselling. I cannot express the exquisite
refinements of the curves on the small scale of Plate XV.; I will give them more accurately
in a larger engraving; but the scale on which they are here given will not prevent the reader
from perceiving, and let him note it thoughtfully, that the outer curve of the noble capital
is the one which was our first example of associated curves; that I have had no need, throughout
the whole of our inquiry, to refer to any other ornamental line than the three which I at first
chose, the simplest of those which Nature set by chance before me; and that this lily, of the
delicate Venetian marble, has but been wrought, by the highest human art, into the same line
which the clouds disclose, when they break from the rough rocks of the flank of the Matterhorn.

FOOTNOTES:

  [84] In very early Doric it was an absolute right line; and that
    capital is therefore derived from the pure cornice root, represented
    by the dotted line.

  [85] The word banded is used by Professor Willis in a different
    sense; which I would respect, by applying it in his sense always to
    the Impost, and in mine to the capital itself. (This note is not for
    the general reader, who need not trouble himself about the matter.)

  [86] The Renaissance period being one of return to formalism on the
    one side, of utter licentiousness on the other, so that sometimes,
    as here, I have to declare its lifelessness, at other times (Chap.
    XXV., § XVII.) its lasciviousness. There is, of course, no
    contradiction in this: but the reader might well ask how I knew the
    change from the base 11 to the base 12, in Plate XII., to be one
    from temperance to luxury; and from the cornice f to the cornice
    g, in Plate XVI., to be one from formalism to vitality. I know it,
    both by certain internal evidences, on which I shall have to dwell
    at length hereafter, and by the context of the works of the time.
    But the outward signs might in both ornaments be the same,
    distinguishable only as signs of opposite tendencies by the event of
    both. The blush of shame cannot always be told from the blush of
    indignation.

  [87] The reader must always remember that a cornice, in becoming a
    capital, must, if not originally bold and deep, have depth added to
    its profile, in order to reach the just proportion of the lower
    member of the shaft head; and that therefore the small Greek egg
    cornices are utterly incapable of becoming capitals till they have
    totally changed their form and depth. The Renaissance architects,
    who never obtained hold of a right principle but they made it worse
    than a wrong one by misapplication, caught the idea of turning the
    cornice into a capital, but did not comprehend the necessity of the
    accompanying change of depth. Hence we have pilaster heads formed of
    small egg cornices, and that meanest of all mean heads of shafts,
    the coarse Roman Doric profile chopped into a small egg and arrow
    moulding, both which may be seen disfiguring half the buildings in
    London.

  [88] I have taken these dates roughly from Selvatico; their absolute
    accuracy to within a year or two, is here of no importance.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

  THE ARCHIVOLT AND APERTURE.

§ I. If the windows and doors of some of our best northern Gothic buildings were built up,
and the ornament of their archivolts concealed, there would often remain little but masses
of dead wall and unsightly buttress; the whole vitality of the building consisting in the graceful
proportions or rich mouldings of its apertures. It is not so in the south, where, frequently,
the aperture is a mere dark spot on the variegated wall; but there the column, with its horizontal
or curved architrave, assumes an importance of another kind, equally dependent upon the methods
of lintel and archivolt decoration. These, though in their richness of minor variety they defy
all exemplification, may be very broadly generalized.

Of the mere lintel, indeed, there is no specific decoration, nor can be; it has no organism
to direct its ornament, and therefore may receive any kind and degree of ornament, according
to its position. In a Greek temple, it has meagre horizontal lines; in a Romanesque church,
it becomes a row of upright niches, with an apostle in each; and may become anything else at
the architect's will. But the arch head has a natural organism, which separates its ornament
into distinct families, broadly definable.

§ II. In speaking of the arch-line and arch masonry, we considered the arch to be cut straight
through the wall; so that, if half built, it would have the appearance at a, Fig. LXIX. But
in the chapter on Form of Apertures, we found that the side of the arch, or jamb of the aperture,
might often require to be bevelled, so as to give the section b, Fig. LXIX. It is easily conceivable
that when two ranges of voussoirs were used, one over another, it would be easier to leave
those beneath, of a smaller diameter, than to bevel them to accurate junction with those outside.
Whether influenced by this facility, or by decorative instinct, the early northern builders
often substitute for the bevel the third condition, c, of Fig. LXIX.; so that, of the three
forms in that figure, a belongs principally to the south, c to the north, and b indifferently
to both.

§ III. If the arch in the northern building be very deep, its depth will probably be attained
by a succession of steps, like that in c; and the richest results of northern archivolt decoration
are entirely based on the aggregation of the ornament of these several steps; while those of
the south are only the complete finish and perfection of the ornament of one. In this ornament
of the single arch, the points for general note are very few.

§ IV. It was, in the first instance, derived from the classical architrave,[91] and the early
Romanesque arches are nothing but such an architrave, bent round. The horizontal lines of the
latter become semicircular, but their importance and value remain exactly the same; their continuity
is preserved across all the voussoirs, and the joints and functions of the latter are studiously
concealed. As the builders get accustomed to the arch, and love it better, they cease to be
ashamed of its structure: the voussoirs begin to show themselves confidently, and fight for
precedence with the architrave lines; and there is an entanglement of the two structures, in
consequence, like the circular and radiating lines of a cobweb, until at last the architrave
lines get worsted, and driven away outside of the voussoirs; being permitted to stay at all
only on condition of their dressing themselves in mediæval costume, as in the plate opposite.

§ V. In other cases, however, before the entire discomfiture of the architrave, a treaty of
peace is signed between the adverse parties on these terms: That the architrave shall entirely
dismiss its inner three meagre lines, and leave the space of them to the voussoirs, to display
themselves after their manner; but that, in return for this concession, the architrave shall
have leave to expand the small cornice which usually terminates it (the reader had better look
at the original form in that of the Erechtheum, in the middle of the Elgin room of the British
Museum) into bolder prominence, and even to put brackets under it, as if it were a roof cornice,
and thus mark with a bold shadow the terminal line of the voussoirs. This condition is seen
in the arch from St. Pietro of Pistoja, Plate XIII., above.

§ VI. If the Gothic spirit of the building be thoroughly determined, and victorious, the architrave
cornice is compelled to relinquish its classical form, and take the profile of a Gothic cornice
or dripstone; while, in other cases, as in much of the Gothic of Verona, it is forced to disappear
altogether. But the voussoirs then concede, on the other hand, so much of their dignity as
to receive a running ornament of foliage or animals, like a classical frieze, and continuous
round the arch. In fact, the contest between the adversaries may be seen running through all
the early architecture of Italy: success inclining sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other,
and various kinds of truce or reconciliation being effected between them: sometimes merely
formal, sometimes honest and affectionate, but with no regular succession in time. The greatest
victory of the voussoir is to annihilate the cornice, and receive an ornament of its own outline,
and entirely limited by its own joints: and yet this may be seen in the very early apse of Murano.

§ VII. The most usual condition, however, is that unity of the two members above described,
§ V., and which may be generally represented by the archivolt section a, Fig. LXX.; and from
this descend a family of Gothic archivolts of the highest importance. For the cornice, thus
attached to the arch, suffers exactly the same changes as the level cornice, or capital; receives,
in due time, its elaborate ogee profile and leaf ornaments, like Fig. 8 or 9 of Plate XV.;
and, when the shaft loses its shape, and is lost in the later Gothic jamb, the archivolt has
influence enough to introduce this ogee profile in the jamb also, through the banded impost:
and we immediately find ourselves involved in deep successions of ogee mouldings in sides of
doors and windows, which never would have been thought of, but for the obstinate resistance
of the classical architrave to the attempts of the voussoir at its degradation or banishment.

§ VIII. This, then, will be the first great head under which we shall in future find it convenient
to arrange a large number of archivolt decorations. It is the distinctively Southern and Byzantine
form, and typically represented by the section a, of Fig. LXX.; and it is susceptible of almost
every species of surface ornament, respecting which only this general law may be asserted:
that, while the outside or vertical surface may properly be decorated, and yet the soffit or
under surface left plain, the soffit is never to be decorated, and the outer surface left plain.
Much beautiful sculpture is, in the best Byzantine buildings, half lost by being put under
soffits; but the eye is led to discover it, and even to demand it, by the rich chasing of the
outside of the voussoirs. It would have been an hypocrisy to carve them externally only. But
there is not the smallest excuse for carving the soffit, and not the outside; for, in that
case, we approach the building under the idea of its being perfectly plain; we do not look
for the soffit decoration, and, of course, do not see it: or, if we do, it is merely to regret
that it should not be in a better place. In the Renaissance architects, it may, perhaps, for
once, be considered a merit, that they put their bad decoration systematically in the places
where we should least expect it, and can seldomest see it:--Approaching the Scuola di San Rocco,
you probably will regret the extreme plainness and barrenness of the window traceries; but,
if you will go very close to the wall beneath the windows, you may, on sunny days, discover
a quantity of panel decorations which the ingenious architect has concealed under the soffits.

The custom of decorating the arch soffit with panelling is a Roman application of the Greek
roof ornament, which, whatever its intrinsic merit (compare Chap. XXIX. § IV.), may rationally
be applied to waggon vaults, as of St. Peter's, and to arch soffits under which one walks.
But the Renaissance architects had not wit enough to reflect that people usually do not walk
through windows.

§ IX. So far, then, of the Southern archivolt: In Fig. LXIX., above, it will be remembered
that c represents the simplest form of the Northern. In the farther development of this, which
we have next to consider, the voussoirs, in consequence of their own negligence or over-confidence,
sustain a total and irrecoverable defeat. That archivolt is in its earliest conditions perfectly
pure and undecorated,--the simplest and rudest of Gothic forms. Necessarily, when it falls
on the pier, and meets that of the opposite arch, the entire section of masonry is in the shape
of a cross, and is carried by the crosslet shaft, which we above stated to be distinctive of
Northern design. I am more at a loss to account for the sudden and fixed development of this
type of archivolt than for any other architectural transition with which I am acquainted. But
there it is, pure and firmly established, as early as the building of St. Michele of Pavia;
and we have thenceforward only to observe what comes of it.

§ X. We find it first, as I said, perfectly barren; cornice and architrave altogether ignored,
the existence of such things practically denied, and a plain, deep-cut recess with a single
mighty shadow occupying their place. The voussoirs, thinking their great adversary utterly
defeated, are at no trouble to show themselves; visible enough in both the upper and under
archivolts, they are content to wait the time when, as might have been hoped, they should receive
a new decoration peculiar to themselves.

§ XI. In this state of paralysis, or expectation, their flank is turned by an insidious chamfer.
The edges of the two great blank archivolts are felt to be painfully conspicuous; all the four
are at once beaded or chamfered, as at b, Fig. LXX.; a rich group of deep lines, running concentrically
with the arch, is the result on the instant, and the fate of the voussoirs is sealed. They
surrender at once without a struggle, and unconditionally; the chamfers deepen and multiply
themselves, cover the soffit, ally themselves with other forms resulting from grouped shafts
or traceries, and settle into the inextricable richness of the fully developed Gothic jamb
and arch; farther complicated in the end by the addition of niches to their recesses, as above
described.

§ XII. The voussoirs, in despair, go over to the classical camp, in hope of receiving some
help or tolerance from their former enemies. They receive it indeed: but as traitors should,
to their own eternal dishonor. They are sharply chiselled at the joints, or rusticated, or
cut into masks and satyrs' heads, and so set forth and pilloried in the various detestable
forms of which the simplest is given above in Plate XIII. (on the left); and others may be
seen in nearly every large building in London, more especially in the bridges; and, as if in
pure spite at the treatment they had received from the archivolt, they are now not content
with vigorously showing their lateral joints, but shape themselves into right-angled steps
at their heads, cutting to pieces their limiting line, which otherwise would have had sympathy
with that of the arch, and fitting themselves to their new friend, the Renaissance Ruled Copy-book
wall. It had been better they had died ten times over, in their own ancient cause, than thus
prolonged their existence.

§ XIII. We bid them farewell in their dishonor, to return to our victorious chamfer. It had
not, we said, obtained so easy a conquest, unless by the help of certain forms of the grouped
shaft. The chamfer was quite enough to decorate the archivolts, if there were no more than
two; but if, as above noticed in § III., the archivolt was very deep, and composed of a succession
of such steps, the multitude of chamferings were felt to be weak and insipid, and instead of
dealing with the outside edges of the archivolts, the group was softened by introducing solid
shafts in their dark inner angles. This, the manliest and best condition of the early northern
jamb and archivolt, is represented in section at fig. 12 of Plate II.; and its simplest aspect
in Plate V., from the Broletto of Como,--an interesting example, because there the voussoirs
being in the midst of their above-described southern contest with the architrave, were better
prepared for the flank attack upon them by the shaft and chamfer, and make a noble resistance,
with the help of color, in which even the shaft itself gets slightly worsted, and cut across
in several places, like General Zach's column at Marengo.

§ XIV. The shaft, however, rapidly rallies, and brings up its own peculiar decorations to its
aid; and the intermediate archivolts receive running or panelled ornaments, also, until we
reach the exquisitely rich conditions of our own Norman archivolts, and of the parallel Lombardic
designs, such as the entrance of the Duomo, and of San Fermo, at Verona. This change, however,
occupies little time, and takes place principally in doorways, owing to the greater thickness
of wall, and depth of archivolt; so that we find the rich shafted succession of ornament, in
the doorway and window aperture, associated with the earliest and rudest double archivolt,
in the nave arches, at St. Michele of Pavia. The nave arches, therefore, are most usually treated
by the chamfer, and the voussoirs are there defeated much sooner than by the shafted arrangements,
which they resist, as we saw, in the south by color; and even in the north, though forced out
of their own shape, they take that of birds' or monsters' heads, which for some time peck and
pinch the rolls of the archivolt to their hearts' content; while the Norman zigzag ornament
allies itself with them, each zigzag often restraining itself amicably between the joints of
each voussoir in the ruder work, and even in the highly finished arches, distinctly presenting
a concentric or sunlike arrangement of lines; so much so, as to prompt the conjecture, above
stated, Chap. XX. § XXVI., that all such ornaments were intended to be typical of light issuing
from the orb of the arch. I doubt the intention, but acknowledge the resemblance; which perhaps
goes far to account for the never-failing delightfulness of this zigzag decoration. The diminution
of the zigzag, as it gradually shares the defeat of the voussoir, and is at last overwhelmed
by the complicated, railroad-like fluency of the later Gothic mouldings, is to me one of the
saddest sights in the drama of architecture.

§ XV. One farther circumstance is deserving of especial note in Plate V., the greater depth
of the voussoirs at the top of the arch. This has been above alluded to as a feature of good
construction, Chap. XI., § III.; it is to be noted now as one still more valuable in decoration:
for when we arrive at the deep succession of concentric archivolts, with which northern portals,
and many of the associated windows, are headed, we immediately find a difficulty in reconciling
the outer curve with the inner. If, as is sometimes the case, the width of the group of archivolts
be twice or three times that of the inner aperture, the inner arch may be distinctly pointed,
and the outer one, if drawn with concentric arcs, approximate very nearly to a round arch.
This is actually the case in the later Gothic of Verona; the outer line of the archivolt having
a hardly perceptible point, and every inner arch of course forming the point more distinctly,
till the innermost becomes a lancet. By far the nobler method, however, is that of the pure
early Italian Gothic; to make every outer arch a magnified fac-simile of the innermost one,
every arc including the same number of degrees, but degrees of a larger circle. The result
is the condition represented in Plate V., often found in far bolder development; exquisitely
springy and elastic in its expression, and entirely free from the heaviness and monotony of
the deep northern archivolts.

§ XVI. We have not spoken of the intermediate form, b, of Fig. LXIX. (which its convenience
for admission of light has rendered common in nearly all architectures), because it has no
transitions peculiar to itself: in the north it sometimes shares the fate of the outer architrave,
and is channelled into longitudinal mouldings; sometimes remains smooth and massy, as in military
architecture, or in the simpler forms of domestic and ecclesiastical. In Italy it receives
surface decoration like the architrave, but has, perhaps, something of peculiar expression
in being placed between the tracery of the window within, and its shafts and tabernacle work
without, as in the Duomo of Florence: in this position it is always kept smooth in surface,
and inlaid (or painted) with delicate arabesques; while the tracery and the tabernacle work
are richly sculptured. The example of its treatment by colored voussoirs, given in Plate XIX.,
may be useful to the reader as a kind of central expression of the aperture decoration of the
pure Italian Gothic;--aperture decoration proper; applying no shaft work to the jambs, but
leaving the bevelled opening unenriched; using on the outer archivolt the voussoirs and concentric
architrave in reconcilement (the latter having, however, some connection with the Norman zigzag);
and beneath them, the pure Italian two-pieced and mid-cusped arch, with rich cusp decoration.
It is a Veronese arch, probably of the thirteenth century, and finished with extreme care;
the red portions are all in brick, delicately cast: and the most remarkable feature of the
whole is the small piece of brick inlaid on the angle of each stone voussoir, with a most just
feeling, which every artist will at once understand, that the color ought not to be let go
all at once.

§ XVII. We have traced the various conditions of treatment in the archivolt alone; but, except
in what has been said of the peculiar expression of the voussoirs, we might throughout have
spoken in the same terms of the jamb. Even a parallel to the expression of the voussoir may
be found in the Lombardic and Norman divisions of the shafts, by zigzags and other transverse
ornamentation, which in the end are all swept away by the canaliculated mouldings. Then, in
the recesses of these and of the archivolts alike, the niche and statue decoration develops
itself; and the vaulted and cavernous apertures are covered with incrustations of fretwork,
and with every various application of foliage to their fantastic mouldings.

§ XVIII. I have kept the inquiry into the proper ornament of the archivolt wholly free from
all confusion with the questions of beauty in tracery; for, in fact, all tracery is a mere
multiplication and entanglement of small archivolts, and its cusp ornament is a minor condition
of that proper to the spandril. It does not reach its completely defined form until the jamb
and archivolt have been divided into longitudinal mouldings; and then the tracery is formed
by the innermost group of the shafts or fillets, bent into whatever forms or foliations the
designer may choose; but this with a delicacy of adaptation which I rather choose to illustrate
by particular examples, of which we shall meet with many in the course of our inquiry, than
to delay the reader by specifying here. As for the conditions of beauty in the disposition
of the tracery bars, I see no hope of dealing with the subject fairly but by devoting, if I
can find time, a separate essay to it--which, in itself, need not be long, but would involve,
before it could be completed, the examination of the whole mass of materials lately collected
by the indefatigable industry of the English architects who have devoted their special attention
to this subject, and which are of the highest value as illustrating the chronological succession
or mechanical structure of tracery, but which, in most cases, touch on their æsthetic merits
incidentally only. Of works of this kind, by far the best I have met with is Mr. Edmund Sharpe's,
on Decorated Windows, which seems to me, as far as a cursory glance can enable me to judge,
to exhaust the subject as respects English Gothic; and which may be recommended to the readers
who are interested in the subject, as containing a clear and masterly enunciation of the general
principles by which the design of tracery has been regulated, from its first development to
its final degradation.

FOOTNOTES:

  [91] The architrave is properly the horizontal piece of stone laid
    across the tops of the pillars in Greek buildings, and commonly
    marked with horizontal lines, obtained by slight projections of its
    surface, while it is protected above in the richer orders, by a
    small cornice.

CHAPTER XXIX.

  THE ROOF.

§ I. The modes of decoration hitherto considered, have been common to the exteriors and interiors
of all noble buildings; and we have taken no notice of the various kinds of ornament which
require protection from weather, and are necessarily confined to interior work. But in the
case of the roof, the exterior and interior treatments become, as we saw in construction, so
also in decoration, separated by broad and bold distinctions. One side of a wall is, in most
cases, the same as another, and if its structure be concealed, it is mostly on the inside;
but, in the roof, the anatomical structure, out of which decoration should naturally spring,
is visible, if at all, in the interior only: so that the subject of internal ornament becomes
both wide and important, and that of external, comparatively subordinate.

§ II. Now, so long as we were concerned principally with the outside of buildings, we might
with safety leave expressional character out of the question for the time, because it is not
to be expected that all persons who pass the building, or see it from a distance, shall be
in the temper which the building is properly intended to induce; so that ornaments somewhat
at variance with this temper may often be employed externally without painful effect. But these
ornaments would be inadmissible in the interior, for those who enter will for the most part
either be in the proper temper which the building requires, or desirous of acquiring it. (The
distinction is not rigidly observed by the mediæval builders, and grotesques, or profane subjects,
occur in the interior of churches, in bosses, crockets, capitals, brackets, and such other
portions of minor ornament: but we do not find the interior wall covered with hunting and battle
pieces, as often the Lombardic exteriors.) And thus the interior expression of the roof or
ceiling becomes necessarily so various, and the kind and degree of fitting decoration so dependent
upon particular circumstances, that it is nearly impossible to classify its methods, or limit
its application.

§ III. I have little, therefore, to say here, and that touching rather the omission than the
selection of decoration, as far as regards interior roofing. Whether of timber or stone, roofs
are necessarily divided into surfaces, and ribs or beams;--surfaces, flat or carved; ribs,
traversing these in the directions where main strength is required; or beams, filling the hollow
of the dark gable with the intricate roof-tree, or supporting the flat ceiling. Wherever the
ribs and beams are simply and unaffectedly arranged, there is no difficulty about decoration;
the beams may be carved, the ribs moulded, and the eye is satisfied at once; but when the vaulting
is unribbed, as in plain waggon vaults and much excellent early Gothic, or when the ceiling
is flat, it becomes a difficult question how far their services may receive ornamentation independent
of their structure. I have never myself seen a flat ceiling satisfactorily decorated, except
by painting: there is much good and fanciful panelling in old English domestic architecture,
but it always is in some degree meaningless and mean. The flat ceilings of Venice, as in the
Scuola di San Rocco and Ducal Palace, have in their vast panellings some of the noblest paintings
(on stretched canvas) which the world possesses: and this is all very well for the ceiling;
but one would rather have the painting in a better place, especially when the rain soaks through
its canvas, as I have seen it doing through many a noble Tintoret. On the whole, flat ceilings
are as much to be avoided as possible; and, when necessary, perhaps a panelled ornamentation
with rich colored patterns is the most satisfying, and loses least of valuable labor. But I
leave the question to the reader's thought, being myself exceedingly undecided respecting it:
except only touching one point--that a blank ceiling is not to be redeemed by a decorated ventilator.

§ IV. I have a more confirmed opinion, however, respecting the decoration of curved surfaces.
The majesty of a roof is never, I think, so great, as when the eye can pass undisturbed over
the course of all its curvatures, and trace the dying of the shadows along its smooth and sweeping
vaults. And I would rather, myself, have a plain ridged Gothic vault, with all its rough stones
visible, to keep the sleet and wind out of a cathedral aisle, than all the fanning and pendanting
and foliation that ever bewildered Tudor weight. But mosaic or fresco may of course be used
as far as we can afford or obtain them; for these do not break the curvature. Perhaps the most
solemn roofs in the world are the apse conchas of the Romanesque basilicas, with their golden
ground and severe figures. Exactly opposed to these are the decorations which disturb the serenity
of the curve without giving it interest, like the vulgar panelling of St. Peter's and the Pantheon;
both, I think, in the last degree detestable.

§ V. As roofs internally may be divided into surfaces and ribs, externally they may be divided
into surfaces, and points, or ridges; these latter often receiving very bold and distinctive
ornament. The outside surface is of small importance in central Europe, being almost universally
low in slope, and tiled throughout Spain, South France, and North Italy: of still less importance
where it is flat, as a terrace; as often in South Italy and the East, mingled with low domes:
but the larger Eastern and Arabian domes become elaborate in ornamentation: I cannot speak
of them with confidence; to the mind of an inhabitant of the north, a roof is a guard against
wild weather; not a surface which is forever to bask in serene heat, and gleam across deserts
like a rising moon. I can only say, that I have never seen any drawing of a richly decorated
Eastern dome that made me desire to see the original.

§ VI. Our own northern roof decoration is necessarily simple. Colored tiles are used in some
cases with quaint effect; but I believe the dignity of the building is always greater when
the roof is kept in an undisturbed mass, opposing itself to the variegation and richness of
the walls. The Italian round tile is itself decoration enough, a deep and rich fluting, which
all artists delight in; this, however, is fitted exclusively for low pitch of roofs. On steep
domestic roofs, there is no ornament better than may be obtained by merely rounding, or cutting
to an angle, the lower extremities of the flat tiles or shingles, as in Switzerland: thus the
whole surface is covered with an appearance of scales, a fish-like defence against water, at
once perfectly simple, natural, and effective at any distance; and the best decoration of sloping
stone roofs, as of spires, is a mere copy of this scale armor; it enriches every one of the
spires and pinnacles of the cathedral of Coutances, and of many Norman and early Gothic buildings.
Roofs covered or edged with lead have often patterns designed upon the lead, gilded and relieved
with some dark color, as on the house of Jaques Coeur at Bourges; and I imagine the effect
of this must have been singularly delicate and beautiful, but only traces of it now remain.
The northern roofs, however, generally stand in little need of surface decoration, the eye
being drawn to the fantastic ranges of their dormer windows, and to the finials and fringes
on their points and ridges.

§ VII. Whether dormer windows are legitimately to be classed as decorative features, seems
to me to admit of doubt. The northern spire system is evidently a mere elevation and exaggeration
of the domestic turret with its look-out windows, and one can hardly part with the grotesque
lines of the projections, though nobody is to be expected to live in the spire: but, at all
events, such windows are never to be allowed in places visibly inaccessible, or on less than
a natural and serviceable scale.

§ VIII. Under the general head of roof-ridge and point decoration, we may include, as above
noted, the entire race of fringes, finials, and crockets. As there is no use in any of these
things, and as they are visible additions and parasitical portions of the structure, more caution
is required in their use than in any other features of ornament, and the architect and spectator
must both be in felicitous humor before they can be well designed or thoroughly enjoyed. They
are generally most admirable where the grotesque Northern spirit has most power; and I think
there is almost always a certain spirit of playfulness in them, adverse to the grandest architectural
effects, or at least to be kept in severe subordination to the serener character of the prevalent
lines. But as they are opposed to the seriousness of majesty on the one hand, so they are to
the weight of dulness on the other; and I know not any features which make the contrast between
continental domestic architecture, and our own, more humiliatingly felt, or which give so sudden
a feeling of new life and delight, when we pass from the streets of London to those of Abbeville
or Rouen, as the quaint points and pinnacles of the roof gables and turrets. The commonest
and heaviest roof may be redeemed by a spike at the end of it, if it is set on with any spirit;
but the foreign builders have (or had, at least) a peculiar feeling in this, and gave animation
to the whole roof by the fringe of its back, and the spike on its forehead, so that all goes
together, like the dorsal fins and spines of a fish: but our spikes have a dull, screwed on,
look; a far-off relationship to the nuts of machinery; and our roof fringes are sure to look
like fenders, as if they were meant to catch ashes out of the London smoke-clouds.

§ IX. Stone finials and crockets are, I think, to be considered in architecture, what points
and flashes of light are in the color of painting, or of nature. There are some landscapes
whose best character is sparkling, and there is a possibility of repose in the midst of brilliancy,
or embracing it,--as on the fields of summer sea, or summer land:

  "Calm, and deep peace, on this high wold,
   And on the dews that drench the furze,
   And on the silvery gossamers,
   That twinkle into green and gold."

And there are colorists who can keep their quiet in the midst of a jewellery of light; but,
for the most part, it is better to avoid breaking up either lines or masses by too many points,
and to make the few points used exceedingly precious. So the best crockets and finials are
set, like stars, along the lines, and at the points, which they adorn, with considerable intervals
between them, and exquisite delicacy and fancy of sculpture in their own designs; if very small,
they may become more frequent, and describe lines by a chain of points; but their whole value
is lost if they are gathered into bunches or clustered into tassels and knots; and an over-indulgence
in them always marks lowness of school. In Venice, the addition of the finial to the arch-head
is the first sign of degradation; all her best architecture is entirely without either crockets
or finials; and her ecclesiastical architecture may be classed, with fearless accuracy, as
better or worse, in proportion to the diminution or expansion of the crocket. The absolutely
perfect use of the crocket is found, I think, in the tower of Giotto, and in some other buildings
of the Pisan school. In the North they generally err on one side or other, and are either florid
and huge, or mean in outline, looking as if they had been pinched out of the stonework, as
throughout the entire cathedral of Amiens; and are besides connected with the generally spotty
system which has been spoken of under the head of archivolt decoration.

§ X. Employed, however, in moderation, they are among the most delightful means of delicate
expression; and the architect has more liberty in their individual treatment than in any other
feature of the building. Separated entirely from the structural system, they are subjected
to no shadow of any other laws than those of grace and chastity; and the fancy may range without
rebuke, for materials of their design, through the whole field of the visible or imaginable
creation.

CHAPTER XXX.

  THE VESTIBULE.

§ I. I have hardly kept my promise. The reader has decorated but little for himself as yet;
but I have not, at least, attempted to bias his judgment. Of the simple forms of decoration
which have been set before him, he has always been left free to choose; and the stated restrictions
in the methods of applying them have been only those which followed on the necessities of construction
previously determined. These having been now defined, I do indeed leave my reader free to build;
and with what a freedom! All the lovely forms of the universe set before him, whence to choose,
and all the lovely lines that bound their substance or guide their motion; and of all these
lines,--and there are myriads of myriads in every bank of grass and every tuft of forest; and
groups of them divinely harmonized, in the bell of every flower, and in every several member
of bird and beast,--of all these lines, for the principal forms of the most important members
of architecture, I have used but Three! What, therefore, must be the infinity of the treasure
in them all! There is material enough in a single flower for the ornament of a score of cathedrals,
but suppose we were satisfied with less exhaustive appliance, and built a score of cathedrals,
each to illustrate a single flower? that would be better than trying to invent new styles,
I think. There is quite difference of style enough, between a violet and a harebell, for all
reasonable purposes.

§ II. Perhaps, however, even more strange than the struggle of our architects to invent new
styles, is the way they commonly speak of this treasure of natural infinity. Let us take our
patience to us for an instant, and hear one of them, not among the least intelligent:--

  "It is not true that all natural forms are beautiful. We may hardly
  be able to detect this in Nature herself; but when the forms are
  separated from the things, and exhibited alone (by sculpture or
  carving), we then see that they are not all fitted for ornamental
  purposes; and indeed that very few, perhaps none, are so fitted
  without correction. Yes, I say correction, for though it is the
  highest aim of every art to imitate nature, this is not to be done by
  imitating any natural form, but by criticising and correcting
  it,--criticising it by Nature's rules gathered from all her works,
  but never completely carried out by her in any one work; correcting
  it, by rendering it more natural, i.e. more conformable to the
  general tendency of Nature, according to that noble maxim recorded of
  Raffaelle, 'that the artist's object was to make things not as Nature
  makes them, but as she WOULD make them;' as she ever tries to make
  them, but never succeeds, though her aim may be deduced from a
  comparison of her efforts; just as if a number of archers had aimed
  unsuccessfully at a mark upon a wall, and this mark were then
  removed, we could by the examination of their arrow marks point out
  the most probable position of the spot aimed at, with a certainty of
  being nearer to it than any of their shots."[92]

§ III. I had thought that, by this time, we had done with that stale, second-hand, one-sided,
and misunderstood saying of Raffaelle's; or that at least, in these days of purer Christian
light, men might have begun to get some insight into the meaning of it: Raffaelle was a painter
of humanity, and assuredly there is something the matter with humanity, a few dovrebbe's, more
or less, wanting in it. We have most of us heard of original sin, and may perhaps, in our modest
moments, conjecture that we are not quite what God, or nature, would have us to be. Raffaelle
had something to mend in Humanity: I should have liked to have seen him mending a daisy!--or
a pease-blossom, or a moth, or a mustard seed, or any other of God's slightest works. If he
had accomplished that, one might have found for him more respectable employment,--to set the
stars in better order, perhaps (they seem grievously scattered as they are, and to be of all
manner of shapes and sizes,--except the ideal shape, and the proper size); or to give us a
corrected view of the ocean; that, at least, seems a very irregular and improveable thing;
the very fishermen do not know, this day, how far it will reach, driven up before the west
wind:--perhaps Some One else does, but that is not our business. Let us go down and stand by
the beach of it,--of the great irregular sea, and count whether the thunder of it is not out
of time. One,--two:--here comes a well-formed wave at last, trembling a little at the top,
but, on the whole, orderly. So, crash among the shingle, and up as far as this grey pebble;
now stand by and watch! Another:--Ah, careless wave! why couldn't you have kept your crest
on? it is all gone away into spray, striking up against the cliffs there--I thought as much--missed
the mark by a couple of feet! Another:--How now, impatient one! couldn't you have waited till
your friend's reflux was done with, instead of rolling yourself up with it in that unseemly
manner? You go for nothing. A fourth, and a goodly one at last. What think we of yonder slow
rise, and crystalline hollow, without a flaw? Steady, good wave; not so fast; not so fast;
where are you coming to?--By our architectural word, this is too bad; two yards over the mark,
and ever so much of you in our face besides; and a wave which we had some hope of, behind there,
broken all to pieces out at sea, and laying a great white table-cloth of foam all the way to
the shore, as if the marine gods were to dine off it! Alas, for these unhappy arrow shots of
Nature; she will never hit her mark with those unruly waves of hers, nor get one of them, into
the ideal shape, if we wait for a thousand years. Let us send for a Greek architect to do it
for her. He comes--the great Greek architect, with measure and rule. Will he not also make
the weight for the winds? and weigh out the waters by measure? and make a decree for the rain,
and a way for the lightning of the thunder? He sets himself orderly to his work, and behold!
this is the mark of nature, and this is the thing into which the great Greek architect improves
the sea--

[Greek: Thalatta, thalatta]: Was it this, then, that they wept to see from the sacred mountain--those
wearied ones?

§ IV. But the sea was meant to be irregular! Yes, and were not also the leaves, and the blades
of grass; and, in a sort, as far as may be without mark of sin, even the countenance of man?
Or would it be pleasanter and better to have us all alike, and numbered on our foreheads, that
we might be known one from the other?

§ V. Is there, then, nothing to be done by man's art? Have we only to copy, and again copy,
for ever, the imagery of the universe? Not so. We have work to do upon it; there is not any
one of us so simple, nor so feeble, but he has work to do upon it. But the work is not to improve,
but to explain. This infinite universe is unfathomable, inconceivable, in its whole; every
human creature must slowly spell out, and long contemplate, such part of it as may be possible
for him to reach; then set forth what he has learned of it for those beneath him; extricating
it from infinity, as one gathers a violet out of grass; one does not improve either violet
or grass in gathering it, but one makes the flower visible; and then the human being has to
make its power upon his own heart visible also, and to give it the honor of the good thoughts
it has raised up in him, and to write upon it the history of his own soul. And sometimes he
may be able to do more than this, and to set it in strange lights, and display it in a thousand
ways before unknown: ways specially directed to necessary and noble purposes, for which he
had to choose instruments out of the wide armory of God. All this he may do: and in this he
is only doing what every Christian has to do with the written, as well as the created word,
"rightly dividing the word of truth." Out of the infinity of the written word, he has also
to gather and set forth things new and old, to choose them for the season and the work that
are before him, to explain and manifest them to others, with such illustration and enforcement
as may be in his power, and to crown them with the history of what, by them, God has done for
his soul. And, in doing this, is he improving the Word of God? Just such difference as there
is between the sense in which a minister may be said to improve a text, to the people's comfort,
and the sense in which an atheist might declare that he could improve the Book, which, if any
man shall add unto, there shall be added unto him the plagues that are written therein; just
such difference is there between that which, with respect to Nature, man is, in his humbleness,
called upon to do, and that which, in his insolence, he imagines himself capable of doing.

§ VI. Have no fear, therefore, reader, in judging between nature and art, so only that you
love both. If you can love one only, then let it be Nature; you are safe with her: but do not
then attempt to judge the art, to which you do not care to give thought, or time. But if you
love both, you may judge between them fearlessly; you may estimate the last, by its making
you remember the first, and giving you the same kind of joy. If, in the square of the city,
you can find a delight, finite, indeed, but pure and intense, like that which you have in a
valley among the hills, then its art and architecture are right; but if, after fair trial,
you can find no delight in them, nor any instruction like that of nature, I call on you fearlessly
to condemn them.

We are forced, for the sake of accumulating our power and knowledge, to live in cities; but
such advantage as we have in association with each other is in great part counterbalanced by
our loss of fellowship with nature. We cannot all have our gardens now, nor our pleasant fields
to meditate in at eventide. Then the function of our architecture is, as far as may be, to
replace these; to tell us about nature; to possess us with memories of her quietness; to be
solemn and full of tenderness, like her, and rich in portraitures of her; full of delicate
imagery of the flowers we can no more gather, and of the living creatures now far away from
us in their own solitude. If ever you felt or found this in a London Street,--if ever it furnished
you with one serious thought, or one ray of true and gentle pleasure,--if there is in your
heart a true delight in its grim railings and dark casements, and wasteful finery of shops,
and feeble coxcombry of club-houses,--it is well: promote the building of more like them. But
if they never taught you anything, and never made you happier as you passed beneath them, do
not think they have any mysterious goodness nor occult sublimity. Have done with the wretched
affectation, the futile barbarism, of pretending to enjoy: for, as surely as you know that
the meadow grass, meshed with fairy rings, is better than the wood pavement, cut into hexagons;
and as surely as you know the fresh winds and sunshine of the upland are better than the choke-damp
of the vault, or the gas-light of the ball-room, you may know, as I told you that you should,
that the good architecture, which has life, and truth, and joy in it, is better than the bad
architecture, which has death, dishonesty, and vexation of heart in it, from the beginning
to the end of time.

§ VII. And now come with me, for I have kept you too long from your gondola: come with me,
on an autumnal morning, through the dark gates of Padua, and let us take the broad road leading
towards the East.

It lies level, for a league or two, between its elms, and vine festoons full laden, their thin
leaves veined into scarlet hectic, and their clusters deepened into gloomy blue; then mounts
an embankment above the Brenta, and runs between the river and the broad plain, which stretches
to the north in endless lines of mulberry and maize. The Brenta flows slowly, but strongly;
a muddy volume of yellowish-grey water, that neither hastens nor slackens, but glides heavily
between its monotonous banks, with here and there a short, babbling eddy twisted for an instant
into its opaque surface, and vanishing, as if something had been dragged into it and gone down.
Dusty and shadeless, the road fares along the dyke on its northern side; and the tall white
tower of Dolo is seen trembling in the heat mist far away, and never seems nearer than it did
at first. Presently you pass one of the much vaunted "villas on the Brenta:" a glaring, spectral
shell of brick and stucco, its windows with painted architraves like picture-frames, and a
court-yard paved with pebbles in front of it, all burning in the thick glow of the feverish
sunshine, but fenced from the high road, for magnificence sake, with goodly posts and chains;
then another, of Kew Gothic, with Chinese variations, painted red and green; a third composed
for the greater part of dead-wall, with fictitious windows painted upon it, each with a pea-green
blind, and a classical architrave in bad perspective; and a fourth, with stucco figures set
on the top of its garden-wall: some antique, like the kind to be seen at the corner of the
New Road, and some of clumsy grotesque dwarfs, with fat bodies and large boots. This is the
architecture to which her studies of the Renaissance have conducted modern Italy.

§ VIII. The sun climbs steadily, and warms into intense white the walls of the little piazza
of Dolo, where we change horses. Another dreary stage among the now divided branches of the
Brenta, forming irregular and half-stagnant canals; with one or two more villas on the other
side of them, but these of the old Venetian type, which we may have recognised before at Padua,
and sinking fast into utter ruin, black, and rent, and lonely, set close to the edge of the
dull water, with what were once small gardens beside them, kneaded into mud, and with blighted
fragments of gnarled hedges and broken stakes for their fencing; and here and there a few fragments
of marble steps, which have once given them graceful access from the water's edge, now settling
into the mud in broken joints, all aslope, and slippery with green weed. At last the road turns
sharply to the north, and there is an open space, covered with bent grass, on the right of
it: but do not look that way.

§ IX. Five minutes more, and we are in the upper room of the little inn at Mestre, glad of
a moment's rest in shade. The table is (always, I think) covered with a cloth of nominal white
and perennial grey, with plates and glasses at due intervals, and small loaves of a peculiar
white bread, made with oil, and more like knots of flour than bread. The view from its balcony
is not cheerful: a narrow street, with a solitary brick church and barren campanile on the
other side of it; and some coventual buildings, with a few crimson remnants of fresco about
their windows; and, between them and the street, a ditch with some slow current in it, and
one or two small houses beside it, one with an arbor of roses at its door, as in an English
tea-garden; the air, however, about us having in it nothing of roses, but a close smell of
garlic and crabs, warmed by the smoke of various stands of hot chestnuts. There is much vociferation
also going on beneath the window respecting certain wheelbarrows which are in rivalry for our
baggage: we appease their rivalry with our best patience, and follow them down the narrow street.

§ X. We have but walked some two hundred yards when we come to a low wharf or quay, at the
extremity of a canal, with long steps on each side down to the water, which latter we fancy
for an instant has become black with stagnation; another glance undeceives us,--it is covered
with the black boats of Venice. We enter one of them, rather to try if they be real boats or
not, than with any definite purpose, and glide away; at first feeling as if the water were
yielding continually beneath the boat and letting her sink into soft vacancy. It is something
clearer than any water we have seen lately, and of a pale green; the banks only two or three
feet above it, of mud and rank grass, with here and there a stunted tree; gliding swiftly past
the small casement of the gondola, as if they were dragged by upon a painted scene.

Stroke by stroke we count the plunges of the oar, each heaving up the side of the boat slightly
as her silver beak shoots forward. We lose patience, and extricate ourselves from the cushions:
the sea air blows keenly by, as we stand leaning on the roof of the floating cell. In front,
nothing to be seen but long canal and level bank; to the west, the tower of Mestre is lowering
fast, and behind it there have risen purple shapes, of the color of dead rose-leaves, all round
the horizon, feebly defined against the afternoon sky,--the Alps of Bassano. Forward still:
the endless canal bends at last, and then breaks into intricate angles about some low bastions,
now torn to pieces and staggering in ugly rents towards the water,--the bastions of the fort
of Malghera. Another turn, and another perspective of canal; but not interminable. The silver
beak cleaves it fast,--it widens: the rank grass of the banks sinks lower, and lower, and at
last dies in tawny knots along an expanse of weedy shore. Over it, on the right, but a few
years back, we might have seen the lagoon stretching to the horizon, and the warm southern
sky bending over Malamocco to the sea. Now we can see nothing but what seems a low and monotonous
dock-yard wall, with flat arches to let the tide through it;--this is the railroad bridge,
conspicuous above all things. But at the end of those dismal arches, there rises, out of the
wide water, a straggling line of low and confused brick buildings, which, but for the many
towers which are mingled among them, might be the suburbs of an English manufacturing town.
Four or five domes, pale, and apparently at a greater distance, rise over the centre of the
line; but the object which first catches the eye is a sullen cloud of black smoke brooding
over the northern half of it, and which issues from the belfry of a church.

It is Venice.

APPENDIX.

  1. FOUNDATION OF VENICE.

I find the chroniclers agree in fixing the year 421, if any: the following sentence from De
Monaci may perhaps interest the reader.

"God, who punishes the sins of men by war sorrows, and whose ways are past finding out, willing
both to save the innocent blood, and that a great power, beneficial to the whole world, should
arise in a spot strange beyond belief, moved the chief men of the cities of the Venetian province
(which from the border of Pannonia, extended as far as the Adda, a river of Lombardy), both
in memory of past, and in dread of future distress, to establish states upon the nearer islands
of the inner gulphs of the Adriatic, to which, in the last necessity, they might retreat for
refuge. And first Galienus de Fontana, Simon de Glauconibus, and Antonius Calvus, or, as others
have it, Adalburtus Falerius, Thomas Candiano, Comes Daulus, Consuls of Padua, by the command
of their King and the desire of the citizens, laid the foundations of the new commonwealth,
under good auspices, on the island of the Rialto, the highest and nearest to the mouth of the
deep river now called the Brenta, in the year of Our Lord, as many writers assure us, four
hundred and twenty-one, on the 25th day of March."[93]

It is matter also of very great satisfaction to know that Venice was founded by good Christians:
"La qual citade è stada hedificada da veri e boni Christiani:" which information I found in
the MS. copy of the Zancarol Chronicle, in the library of St. Mark's.

Finally the conjecture as to the origin of her name, recorded by Sansovino, will be accepted
willingly by all who love Venice: "Fu interpretato da alcuni, che questa voce VENETIA voglia
dire VENI ETIAM, cioè, vieni ancora, e ancora, percioche quante volte verrai, sempre vedrai
nuove cose, enuove bellezze."

  2. POWER OF THE DOGES.

The best authorities agree in giving the year 697 as that of the election of the first doge,
Paul Luke Anafeste. He was elected in a general meeting of the commonalty, tribunes, and clergy,
at Heraclea, "divinis rebus procuratis," as usual, in all serious work, in those times. His
authority is thus defined by Sabellico, who was not likely to have exaggerated it:--"Penes
quem decus omne imperii ac majestas esset: cui jus concilium cogendi quoties de republica aliquid
referri oporteret; qui tribunos annuos in singulas insulas legeret, a quibus ad Ducem esset
provocatio. Cæterum, si quis dignitatem, ecclesiam, sacerdotumve cleri populique suffragio
esset adeptus, ita demum id ratum haberetur si dux ipse auctor factus esset." (Lib. I.) The
last clause is very important, indicating the subjection of the ecclesiastical to the popular
and ducal (or patrician) powers, which, throughout her career, was one of the most remarkable
features in the policy of Venice. The appeal from the tribunes to the doge is also important;
and the expression "decus omne imperii," if of somewhat doubtful force, is at least as energetic
as could have been expected from an historian under the influence of the Council of Ten.

  3. SERRAR DEL CONSIGLIO.

The date of the decree which made the right of sitting in the grand council hereditary, is
variously given; the Venetian historians themselves saying as little as they can about it.
The thing was evidently not accomplished at once, several decrees following in successive years:
the Council of Ten was established without any doubt in 1310, in consequence of the conspiracy
of Tiepolo. The Venetian verse, quoted by Mutinelli (Annali Urbani di Venezia, p. 153), is
worth remembering.

  "Del mille tresento e diese
   A mezzo el mese delle ceriese
   Bagiamonte passò el ponte
   E per esso fo fatto el Consegio di diese."

The reader cannot do better than take 1297 as the date of the beginning of the change of government,
and this will enable him exactly to divide the 1100 years from the election of the first doge
into 600 of monarchy and 500 of aristocracy. The coincidence of the numbers is somewhat curious;
697 the date of the establishment of the government, 1297 of its change, and 1797 of its fall.

  4. S. PIETRO DI CASTELLO.

It is credibly reported to have been founded in the seventh century, and (with somewhat less
of credibility) in a place where the Trojans, conducted by Antenor, had, after the destruction
of Troy, built "un castello, chiamato prima Troja, poscia Olivolo, interpretato, luogo pieno."
It seems that St. Peter appeared in person to the Bishop of Heraclea, and commanded him to
found in his honor, a church in that spot of the rising city on the Rialto: "ove avesse veduto
una mandra di buoi e di pecore pascolare unitamente. Questa fu la prodigiosa origine della
Chiesa di San Pietro, che poscia, o rinovata, o ristaurata, da Orso Participazio IV Vescovo
Olivolense, divenne la Cattedrale della Nuova citta." (Notizie Storiche delle Chiese e Monasteri
di Venezia. Padua, 1758.) What there was so prodigious in oxen and sheep feeding together,
we need St. Peter, I think, to tell us. The title of Bishop of Castello was first taken in
1091: St. Mark's was not made the cathedral church till 1807. It may be thought hardly fair
to conclude the small importance of the old St. Pietro di Castello from the appearance of the
wretched modernisations of 1620. But these modernisations are spoken of as improvements; and
I find no notice of peculiar beauties in the older building, either in the work above quoted,
or by Sansovino; who only says that when it was destroyed by fire (as everything in Venice
was, I think, about three times in a century), in the reign of Vital Michele, it was rebuilt
"with good thick walls, maintaining, for all that, the order of its arrangement taken from
the Greek mode of building." This does not seem the description of a very enthusiastic effort
to rebuild a highly ornate cathedral. The present church is among the least interesting in
Venice; a wooden bridge, something like that of Battersea on a small scale, connects its island,
now almost deserted, with a wretched suburb of the city behind the arsenal; and a blank level
of lifeless grass, rotted away in places rather than trodden, is extended before its mildewed
façade and solitary tower.

  5. PAPAL POWER IN VENICE.

I may refer the reader to the eleventh chapter of the twenty-eighth book of Daru for some account
of the restraints to which the Venetian clergy were subjected. I have not myself been able
to devote any time to the examination of the original documents bearing on this matter, but
the following extract from a letter of a friend, who will not at present permit me to give
his name, but who is certainly better conversant with the records of the Venetian State than
any other Englishman, will be of great value to the general reader:--

"In the year 1410, or perhaps at the close of the thirteenth century, churchmen were excluded
from the Grand Council and declared ineligible to civil employment; and in the same year, 1410,
the Council of Ten, with the Giunta, decreed that whenever in the state's councils matters
concerning ecclesiastical affairs were being treated, all the kinsfolk of Venetian beneficed
clergymen were to be expelled; and, in the year 1434, the RELATIONS of churchmen were declared
ineligible to the post of ambassador at Rome.

"The Venetians never gave possession of any see in their territories to bishops unless they
had been proposed to the pope by the senate, which elected the patriarch, who was supposed,
at the end of the sixteenth century, to be liable to examination by his Holiness, as an act
of confirmation of installation; but of course, everything depended on the relative power at
any given time of Rome and Venice: for instance, a few days after the accession of Julius II.,
in 1503, he requests the Signory, cap in hand, to ALLOW him to confer the archbishopric of
Zara on a dependant of his, one Cipico the Bishop of Famagosta. Six years later, when Venice
was overwhelmed by the leaguers of Cambrai, that furious pope would assuredly have conferred
Zara on Cipico WITHOUT asking leave. In 1608, the rich Camaldolite Abbey of Vangadizza, in
the Polesine, fell vacant through the death of Lionardo Loredano, in whose family it had been
since some while. The Venetian ambassador at Rome received the news on the night of the 28th
December; and, on the morrow, requested Paul IV. not to dispose of this preferment until he
heard from the senate. The pope talked of 'poor cardinals' and of his nephew, but made no positive
reply; and, as Francesco Contarini was withdrawing, said to him: 'My Lord ambassador, with
this opportunity we will inform you that, to our very great regret, we understand that the
chiefs of the Ten mean to turn sacristans; for they order the parish priests to close the church
doors at the Ave Maria, and not to ring the bells at certain hours. This is precisely the sacristan's
office; we don't know why their lordships, by printed edicts, which we have seen, choose to
interfere in this matter. This is pure and mere ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and even, in case
of any inconvenience arising, is there not the patriarch, who is at any rate your own; why
not apply to him, who could remedy these irregularities? These are matters which cause us very
notable displeasure; we say so that they may be written and known: it is decided by the councils
and canons, and not uttered by us, that whosoever forms any resolve against the ecclesiastical
liberty, cannot do so without incurring censure: and in order that Father Paul [Bacon's correspondent]
may not say hereafter, as he did in his past writings, that our predecessors assented either
tacitly or by permission, we declare that we do not give our assent, nor do we approve it;
nay, we blame it, and let this be announced in Venice, so that, for the rest, every one may
take care of his own conscience. St. Thomas à Becket, whose festival is celebrated this very
day, suffered martyrdom for the ecclesiastical liberty; it is our duty likewise to support
and defend it.' Contarini says: 'This remonstrance was delivered with some marks of anger,
which induced me to tell him how the tribunal of the most excellent the Lords chiefs of the
Ten is in our country supreme; that it does not do its business unadvisedly, or condescend
to unworthy matters; and that, therefore, should those Lords have come to any public declaration
of their will, it must be attributed to orders anterior, and to immemorial custom and authority,
recollecting that, on former occasions likewise, similar commissions were given to prevent
divers incongruities; wherefore an upright intention, such as this, ought not to be taken in
any other sense than its own, especially as the parishes of Venice were in her own gift,' &c.
&c. The pope persisted in bestowing the abbacy on his nephew, but the republic would not give
possession, and a compromise was effected by its being conferred on the Venetian Matteo Priuli,
who allowed the cardinal five thousand ducats per annum out of its revenues. A few years before
this, this very same pope excommunicated the State, because she had imprisoned two churchmen
for heinous crimes; the strife lasted for more than a year, and ended through the mediation
of Henry IV., at whose suit the prisoners were delivered to the French ambassador, who made
them over to a papal commissioner.

"In January, 1484, a tournament was in preparation on St. Mark's Square: some murmurs had been
heard about the distribution of the prizes having been pre-arranged, without regard to the
'best man.' One of the chiefs of the Ten was walking along Rialto on the 28th January, when
a young priest, twenty-two years old, a sword-cutlers son, and a Bolognese, and one of Perugia,
both men-at-arms under Robert Sansoverino, fell upon a clothier with drawn weapons. The chief
of the Ten desired they might be seized, but at the moment the priest escaped; he was, however,
subsequently retaken, and in that very evening hanged by torch-light between the columns with
the two soldiers. Innocent VIII. was less powerful than Paul IV.; Venice weaker in 1605 than
in 1484.

"* * * The exclusion from the Grand Council, whether at the end of the fourteenth or commencement
of the following century, of the Venetian ecclesiastics, (as induced either by the republic's
acquisitions on the main land then made, and which, through the rich benefices they embraced,
might have rendered an ambitious churchman as dangerous in the Grand Council as a victorious
condottiere; or from dread of their allegiance being divided between the church and their country,
it being acknowledged that no man can serve two masters,) did not render them hostile to their
fatherland, whose interests were, with very few exceptions, eagerly fathered by the Venetian
prelates at Rome, who, in their turn, received all honor at Venice, where state receptions
given to cardinals of the houses of Correr, Grimani, Cornaro, Pisani, Contarini, Zeno, Delfino,
and others, vouch for the good understanding that existed between the 'Papalists' and their
countrymen. The Cardinal Grimani was instrumental in detaching Julius II. from the league of
Cambrai; the Cardinal Cornaro always aided the state to obtain anything required of Leo X.;
and, both before and after their times, all Venetians that had a seat in the Sacred College
were patriots rather than pluralists: I mean that they cared more for Venice than for their
benefices, admitting thus the soundness of that policy which denied them admission into the
Grand Council."

To this interesting statement, I shall add, from the twenty-eighth book of Daru, two passages,
well deserving consideration by us English in present days:

"Pour être parfaitement assurée contre les envahissements de la puissance ecclésiastique, Venise
commença par lui ôter tout prétexte d'intervenir dans les affaires de l'Etat; elle resta invariablement
fidèle au dogme. Jamais aucune des opinions nouvelles n'y prit la moindre faveur; jamais aucun
hérésiarque ne sortit de Venise. Les conciles, les disputes, les guerres de religion, se passèrent
sans qu'elle y prit jamais la moindre part. Inébranlable dans sa foi, elle ne fut pas moins
invariable dans son système de tolérance. Non seulement ses sujets de la religion grecque conservèrent
l'exercise de leur culte, leurs évêques et leurs prêtres; mais les Protestantes, les Arméniens,
les Mahomitans, les Juifs, toutes les religions, toutes les sectes qui se trouvaient dans Venise,
avaient des temples, et la sépulture dans les églises n'était point refusé aux hérétiques.
Une police vigilante s'appliquait avec le même soin à éteindre les discordes, et à empêcher
les fanatiques et les novateurs de troubler l'Etat."

       *       *       *       *       *

"Si on considère que c'est dans un temps où presque toutes les nations tremblaient devant la
puissance pontificale, que les Vénitiens surent tenir leur clergé dans la dépendance, et braver
souvent les censures ecclésiastiques et les interdits, sans encourir jamais aucun reproche
sur la pureté de leur foi, on sera forcé de reconnaître que cette république avait dévancé
de loin les autres peuples dans cette partie de la science du gouvernement. La fameuse maxime,
'Siamo veneziani, poi christiani,' n'était qu'une formule énergique qui ne prouvait point quils
voulussent placer l'intérêt de la religion après celui de l'Etat, mais qui annonçait leur invariable
résolution de ne pas souffrir qu'un pouvoir étranger portât atteinte aux droits de la république.

"Dans toute la durée de son existence, an milieu des revers comme dans la prospérité cet inébranlable
gouvernement ne fit qu'une seule fois des concessions à la cour de Borne, et ce fut pour détacher
le Pape Jules II. de la ligue de Cambrai.

"Jamais il ne se relâcha du soin de tenir le clergé dans une nullité absolue relativement aux
affaires politiques; on peut en juger par la conduite qu'il tint avec l'ordre religieux le
plus redoutable et le plus accoutumé à s'immiscer dans les secrets de l'Etat et dans les intérêts
temporels."

The main points, next stated, respecting the Jesuits are, that the decree which permitted their
establishment in Venice required formal renewal every three years; that no Jesuit could stay
in Venice more than three years; that the slightest disobedience to the authority of the government
was instantly punished by imprisonment; that no Venetian could enter the order without express
permission from the government; that the notaries were forbidden to sanction any testamentary
disposal of property to the Jesuits; finally, that the heads of noble families were forbidden
to permit their children to be educated in the Jesuits' colleges, on pain of degradation from
their rank.

Now, let it be observed that the enforcement of absolute exclusion of the clergy from the councils
of the state, dates exactly from the period which I have marked for the commencement of the
decline of the Venetian power. The Romanist is welcome to his advantage in this fact, if advantage
it be; for I do not bring forward the conduct of the senate of Venice, as Daru does, by way
of an example of the general science of government. The Venetians accomplished therein what
we ridiculously call a separation of "Church and State" (as if the State were not, in all Christendom,
necessarily also the Church[94]), but ought to call a separation of lay and clerical officers.
I do not point out this separation as subject of praise, but as the witness borne by the Venetians
against the principles of the Papacy. If they were to blame, in yielding to their fear of the
ambitious spirit of Rome so far as to deprive their councils of all religious element, what
excuse are we to offer for the state, which, with Lords Spiritual of her own faith already
in her senate, permits the polity of Rome to be represented by lay members? To have sacrificed
religion to mistaken policy, or purchased security with ignominy, would have been no new thing
in the world's history; but to be at once impious and impolitic, and seek for danger through
dishonor, was reserved for the English parliament of 1829.

I am glad to have this opportunity of referring to, and farther enforcing, the note on this
subject which, not without deliberation, I appended to the "Seven Lamps;" and of adding to
it the following passage, written by my father in the year 1839, and published in one of the
journals of that year:--a passage remarkable as much for its intrinsic value, as for having
stated, twelve years ago, truths to which the mind of England seems but now, and that slowly,
awakening.

"We hear it said, that it cannot be merely the Roman religion that causes the difficulty [respecting
Ireland], for we were once all Roman Catholics, and nations abroad of this faith are not as
the Irish. It is totally overlooked, that when we were so, our government was despotic, and
fit to cope with this dangerous religion, as most of the Continental governments yet are. In
what Roman Catholic state, or in what age of Roman Catholic England, did we ever hear of such
agitation as now exists in Ireland by evil men taking advantage of an anomalous state of things--Roman
Catholic ignorance in the people, Protestant toleration in the government? We have yet to feel
the tremendous difficulty in which Roman Catholic emancipation has involved us. Too late we
discover that a Roman Catholic is wholly incapable of being safely connected with the British
constitution, as it now exists, in any near relation. The present constitution is no longer
fit for Catholics. It is a creature essentially Protestant, growing with the growth, and strengthening
with the strength, of Protestantism. So entirely is Protestantism interwoven with the whole
frame of our constitution and laws, that I take my stand on this, against all agitators in
existence, that the Roman religion is totally incompatible with the British constitution. We
have, in trying to combine them, got into a maze of difficulties; we are the worse, and Ireland
none the better. It is idle to talk of municipal reform or popular Lords Lieutenant. The mild
sway of a constitutional monarchy is not strong enough for a Roman Catholic population. The
stern soul of a Republican would not shrink from sending half the misguided population and
all the priests into exile, and planting in their place an industrious Protestant people. But
you cannot do this, and you cannot convert the Irish, nor by other means make them fit to wear
the mild restraints of a Protestant Government. It was, moreover, a strange logic that begot
the idea of admitting Catholics to administer any part of our laws or constitution. It was
admitted by all that, by the very act of abandoning the Roman religion, we became a free and
enlightened people. It was only by throwing off the yoke of that slavish religion that we attained
to the freedom of thought which has advanced us in the scale of society. We are so much advanced
by adopting and adhering to a reformed religion, that to prove our liberal and unprejudiced
views, we throw down the barriers betwixt the two religions, of which the one is the acknowledged
cause of light and knowledge, the other the cause of darkness and ignorance. We are so much
altered to the better by leaving this people entirely, and giving them neither part nor lot
amongst us, that it becomes proper to mingle again with them. We have found so much good in
leaving them, that we deem it the best possible reason for returning to be among them. No fear
of their Church again shaking us, with all our light and knowledge. It is true, the most enlightened
nations fell under the spell of her enchantments, fell into total darkness and superstition;
but no fear of us--we are too well informed! What miserable reasoning! infatuated presumption!
I fear me, when the Roman religion rolled her clouds of darkness over the earlier ages, that
she quenched as much light, and knowledge, and judgment as our modern Liberals have ever displayed.
I do not expect a statesman to discuss the point of Transubstantiation betwixt Protestant and
Catholic, nor to trace the narrow lines which divide Protestant sectarians from each other;
but can any statesman that shall have taken even a cursory glance at the face of Europe, hesitate
a moment on the choice of the Protestant religion? If he unfortunately knew nothing of its
being the true one in regard to our eternal interests, he is at least bound to see whether
it be not the best for the worldly prosperity of a people. He may be but moderately imbued
with pious zeal for the salvation of a kingdom, but at least he will be expected to weigh the
comparative merits of religion, as of law or government; and blind, indeed, must he be if he
does not discern that, in neglecting to cherish the Protestant faith, or in too easily yielding
to any encroachments on it, he is foregoing the use of a state engine more powerful than all
the laws which the uninspired legislators of the earth have ever promulgated, in promoting
the happiness, the peace, prosperity, and the order, the industry, and the wealth, of a people;
in forming every quality valuable or desirable in a subject or a citizen; in sustaining the
public mind at that point of education and information that forms the best security for the
state, and the best preservative for the freedom of a people, whether religious or political."

  6. RENAISSANCE ORNAMENTS.

There having been three principal styles of architecture in Venice,--the Greek or Byzantine,
the Gothic, and the Renaissance, it will be shown, in the sequel, that the Renaissance itself
is divided into three correspondent families: Renaissance engrafted on Byzantine, which is
earliest and best; Renaissance engrafted on Gothic, which is second, and second best; Renaissance
on Renaissance, which is double darkness, and worst of all. The palaces in which Renaissance
is engrafted on Byzantine are those noticed by Commynes: they are characterized by an ornamentation
very closely resembling, and in some cases identical with, early Byzantine work; namely, groups
of colored marble circles inclosed in interlacing bands. I have put on the opposite page one
of these ornaments, from the Ca' Trevisan, in which a most curious and delicate piece of inlaid
design is introduced into a band which is almost exactly copied from the church of Theotocos
at Constantinople, and correspondent with others in St. Mark's. There is also much Byzantine
feeling in the treatment of the animals, especially in the two birds of the lower compartment,
while the peculiar curves of the cinque cento leafage are visible in the leaves above. The
dove, alighted, with the olive-branch plucked off, is opposed to the raven with restless expanded
wings. Beneath are evidently the two sacrifices "of every clean fowl and of every clean beast."
The color is given with green and white marbles, the dove relieved on a ground of greyish green,
and all is exquisitely finished.

In Plate I., p. 13, the upper figure is from the same palace (Ca' Trevisan), and it is very
interesting in its proportions. If we take five circles in geometrical proportion, each diameter
being two-thirds of the diameter next above it, and arrange the circles so proportioned, in
contact with each other, in the manner shown in the plate, we shall find that an increase quite
imperceptible in the diameter of the circles in the angles, will enable us to inscribe the
whole in a square. The lines so described will then run in the centre of the white bands. I
cannot be certain that this is the actual construction of the Trevisan design, because it is
on a high wall surface, where I could not get at its measurements; but I found this construction
exactly coincide with the lines of my eye sketch. The lower figure in Plate I. is from the
front of the Ca' Dario, and probably struck the eye of Commynes in its first brightness. Salvatico,
indeed, considers both the Ca' Trevisan (which once belonged to Bianca Cappello) and the Ca'
Dario, as buildings of the sixteenth century. I defer the discussion of the question at present,
but have, I believe, sufficient reason for assuming the Ca' Dario to have been built about
1486, and the Ca' Trevisan not much later.

  7. VARIETIES OF THE ORDERS.

Of these phantasms and grotesques, one of some general importance is that commonly called Ionic,
of which the idea was taken (Vitruvius says) from a woman's hair, curled; but its lateral processes
look more like rams' horns: be that as it may, it is a mere piece of agreeable extravagance,
and if, instead of rams' horns, you put ibex horns, or cows' horns, or an ass's head at once,
you will have ibex orders, or ass orders, or any number of other orders, one for every head
or horn. You may have heard of another order, the Composite, which is Ionic and Corinthian
mixed, and is one of the worst of ten thousand forms referable to the Corinthian as their head:
it may be described as a spoiled Corinthian. And you may have also heard of another order,
called Tuscan (which is no order at all, but a spoiled Doric): and of another called Roman
Doric, which is Doric more spoiled, both which are simply among the most stupid variations
ever invented upon forms already known. I find also in a French pamphlet upon architecture,[95]
as applied to shops and dwelling houses, a sixth order, the "Ordre Français," at least as good
as any of the three last, and to be hailed with acclamation, considering whence it comes, there
being usually more tendency on the other side of the channel to the confusion of "orders" than
their multiplication: but the reader will find in the end that there are in very deed only
two orders, of which the Greek, Doric, and Corinthian are the first examples, and they not
perfect, nor in anywise sufficiently representative of the vast families to which they belong;
but being the first and the best known, they may properly be considered as the types of the
rest. The essential distinctions of the two great orders he will find explained in §§ XXXV.
and XXXVI. of Chap. XXVII., and in the passages there referred to; but I should rather desire
that these passages might be read in the order in which they occur.

  8. THE NORTHERN ENERGY.

I have sketched above, in the First Chapter, the great events of architectural history in the
simplest and fewest words I could; but this indraught of the Lombard energies upon the Byzantine
rest, like a wild north wind descending into a space of rarified atmosphere, and encountered
by an Arab simoom from the south, may well require from us some farther attention; for the
differences in all these schools are more in the degrees of their impetuosity and refinement
(these qualities being, in most cases, in inverse ratio, yet much united by the Arabs) than
in the style of the ornaments they employ. The same leaves, the same animals, the same arrangement,
are used by Scandinavians, ancient Britons, Saxons, Normans, Lombards, Romans, Byzantines,
and Arabians; all being alike descended through classic Greece from Egypt and Assyria, and
some from Phoenicia. The belts which encompass the Assyrian bulls, in the hall of the British
Museum, are the same as the belts of the ornaments found in Scandinavian tumuli; their method
of ornamentation is the same as that of the gate of Mycenæ, and of the Lombard pulpit of St.
Ambrogio of Milan, and of the church of Theotocos at Constantinople; the essential differences
among the great schools are their differences of temper and treatment, and science of expression;
it is absurd to talk of Norman ornaments, and Lombard ornaments, and Byzantine ornaments, as
formally distinguished; but there is irreconcileable separation between Arab temper, and Lombard
temper, and Byzantine temper.

Now, as far as I have been able to compare the three schools, it appears to me that the Arab
and Lombard are both distinguished from the Byzantine by their energy and love of excitement,
but the Lombard stands alone in his love of jest: Neither an Arab nor Byzantine ever jests
in his architecture; the Lombard has great difficulty in ever being thoroughly serious; thus
they represent three conditions of humanity, one in perfect rest, the Byzantine, with exquisite
perception of grace and dignity; the Arab, with the same perception of grace, but with a restless
fever in his blood; the Lombard, equally energetic, but not burning himself away, capable of
submitting to law, and of enjoying jest. But the Arabian feverishness infects even the Lombard
in the South, showing itself, however, in endless invention, with a refreshing firmness and
order directing the whole of it. The excitement is greatest in the earliest times, most of
all shown in St. Michele of Pavia; and I am strongly disposed to connect much of its peculiar
manifestations with the Lombard's habits of eating and drinking, especially his carnivorousness.
The Lombard of early times seems to have been exactly what a tiger would be, if you could give
him love of a joke, vigorous imagination, strong sense of justice, fear of hell, knowledge
of northern mythology, a stone den, and a mallet and chisel; fancy him pacing up and down in
the said den to digest his dinner, and striking on the wall, with a new fancy in his head,
at every turn, and you have the Lombardic sculptor. As civilisation increases the supply of
vegetables, and shortens that of wild beasts, the excitement diminishes; it is still strong
in the thirteenth century at Lyons and Rouen; it dies away gradually in the later Gothic, and
is quite extinct in the fifteenth century.

I think I shall best illustrate this general idea by simply copying the entries in my diary
which were written when, after six months' close study of Byzantine work in Venice, I came
again to the Lombard work of Verona and Pavia. There are some other points alluded to in these
entries not pertaining to the matter immediately in hand; but I have left them, as they will
be of use hereafter.

"(Verona.) Comparing the arabesque and sculpture of the Duomo here with St. Mark's, the first
thing that strikes one is the low relief, the second, the greater motion and spirit, with infinitely
less grace and science. With the Byzantine, however rude the cutting, every line is lovely,
and the animals or men are placed in any attitudes which secure ornamental effect, sometimes
impossible ones, always severe, restrained, or languid. With the Romanesque workmen all the
figures show the effort (often successful) to express energetic action; hunting chiefly, much
fighting, and both spirited; some of the dogs running capitally, straining to it, and the knights
hitting hard, while yet the faces and drawing are in the last degree barbarous. At Venice all
is graceful, fixed, or languid; the eastern torpor is in every line,--the mark of a school
formed on severe traditions, and keeping to them, and never likely or desirous to rise beyond
them, but with an exquisite sense of beauty, and much solemn religious faith.

"If the Greek outer archivolt of St. Mark's is Byzantine, the law is somewhat broken by its
busy domesticity; figures engaged in every trade, and in the preparation of viands of all kinds;
a crowded kind of London Christmas scene, interleaved (literally) by the superb balls of leafage,
unique in sculpture; but even this is strongly opposed to the wild war and chase passion of
the Lombard. Farther, the Lombard building is as sharp, precise, and accurate, as that of St.
Mark's is careless. The Byzantines seem to have been too lazy to put their stones together;
and, in general, my first impression on coming to Verona, after four months in Venice, is of
the exquisitely neat masonry and perfect feeling here; a style of Gothic formed by a combination
of Lombard surface ornament with Pisan Gothic, than which nothing can possibly be more chaste,
pure, or solemn."

I have said much of the shafts of the entrance to the crypt of St. Zeno;[96] the following
note of the sculptures on the archivolt above them is to our present purpose:

"It is covered by very light but most effective bas-reliefs of jesting subject:--two cocks
carrying on their shoulders a long staff to which a fox (?) is tied by the legs, hanging down
between them: the strut of the foremost cock, lifting one leg at right angles to the other,
is delicious. Then a stag hunt, with a centaur horseman drawing a bow; the arrow has gone clear
through the stag's throat, and is sticking there. Several capital hunts with dogs, with fruit
trees between, and birds in them; the leaves, considering the early time, singularly well set,
with the edges outwards, sharp, and deep cut: snails and frogs filling up the intervals, as
if suspended in the air, with some saucy puppies on their hind legs, two or three nondescript
beasts; and, finally, on the centre of one of the arches on the south side, an elephant and
castle,--a very strange elephant, yet cut as if the carver had seen one."

Observe this elephant and castle; we shall meet with him farther north.

"These sculptures of St. Zeno are, however, quite quiet and tame compared with those of St.
Michele of Pavia, which are designed also in a somewhat gloomier mood; significative, as I
think, of indigestion. (Note that they are much earlier than St. Zeno; of the seventh century
at latest. There is more of nightmare, and less of wit in them.) Lord Lindsay has described
them admirably, but has not said half enough; the state of mind represented by the west front
is more that of a feverish dream, than resultant from any determined architectural purpose,
or even from any definite love and delight in the grotesque. One capital is covered with a
mass of grinning heads, other heads grow out of two bodies, or out of and under feet; the creatures
are all fighting, or devouring, or struggling which shall be uppermost, and yet in an ineffectual
way, as if they would fight for ever, and come to no decision. Neither sphinxes nor centaurs
did I notice, nor a single peacock (I believe peacocks to be purely Byzantine), but mermaids
with two tails (the sculptor having perhaps seen double at the time), strange, large fish,
apes, stags (bulls?), dogs, wolves, and horses, griffins, eagles, long-tailed birds (cocks?),
hawks, and dragons, without end, or with a dozen of ends, as the case may be; smaller birds,
with rabbits, and small nondescripts, filling the friezes. The actual leaf, which is used in
the best Byzantine mouldings at Venice, occurs in parts of these Pavian designs. But the Lombard
animals are all alive, and fiercely alive too, all impatience and spring: the Byzantine birds
peck idly at the fruit, and the animals hardly touch it with their noses. The cinque cento
birds in Venice hold it up daintily, like train-bearers; the birds in the earlier Gothic peck
at it hungrily and naturally; but the Lombard beasts gripe at it like tigers, and tear it off
with writhing lips and glaring eyes. They are exactly like Jip with the bit of geranium, worrying
imaginary cats in it."

The notice of the leaf in the above extract is important,--it is the vine-leaf; used constantly
both by Byzantines and Lombards, but by the latter with especial frequency, though at this
time they were hardly able to indicate what they meant. It forms the most remarkable generality
of the St. Michele decoration; though, had it not luckily been carved on the façade, twining
round a stake, and with grapes, I should never have known what it was meant for, its general
form being a succession of sharp lobes, with incised furrows to the point of each. But it is
thrown about in endless change; four or five varieties of it might be found on every cluster
of capitals: and not content with this, the Lombards hint the same form even in their griffin
wings. They love the vine very heartily.

In St. Michele of Lucca we have perhaps the noblest instance in Italy of the Lombard spirit
in its later refinement. It is some four centuries later than St. Michele of Pavia, and the
method of workmanship is altogether different. In the Pavian church, nearly all the ornament
is cut in a coarse sandstone, in bold relief: a darker and harder stone (I think, not serpentine,
but its surface is so disguised by the lustre of ages that I could not be certain) is used
for the capitals of the western door, which are especially elaborate in their sculpture;--two
devilish apes, or apish devils, I know not which, with bristly moustaches and edgy teeth, half-crouching,
with their hands impertinently on their knees, ready for a spit or a spring if one goes near
them; but all is pure bossy sculpture; there is no inlaying, except of some variegated tiles
in the shape of saucers set concave (an ornament used also very gracefully in St. Jacopo of
Bologna): and the whole surface of the church is enriched with the massy reliefs, well preserved
everywhere above the reach of human animals, but utterly destroyed to some five or six feet
from the ground; worn away into large cellular hollows and caverns, some almost deep enough
to render the walls unsafe, entirely owing to the uses to which the recesses of the church
are dedicated by the refined and high-minded Italians. But St. Michele of Lucca is wrought
entirely in white marble and green serpentine; there is hardly any relieved sculpture except
in the capitals of the shafts and cornices, and all the designs of wall ornament are inlaid
with exquisite precision--white on dark ground; the ground being cut out and filled with serpentine,
the figures left in solid marble. The designs of the Pavian church are encrusted on the walls;
of the Lucchese, incorporated with them; small portions of real sculpture being introduced
exactly where the eye, after its rest on the flatness of the wall, will take most delight in
the piece of substantial form. The entire arrangement is perfect beyond all praise, and the
morbid restlessness of the old designs is now appeased. Geometry seems to have acted as a febrifuge,
for beautiful geometrical designs are introduced amidst the tumult of the hunt; and there is
no more seeing double, nor ghastly monstrosity of conception; no more ending of everything
in something else; no more disputing for spare legs among bewildered bodies; no more setting
on of heads wrong side foremost. The fragments have come together: we are out of the Inferno
with its weeping down the spine; we are in the fair hunting-fields of the Lucchese mountains
(though they had their tears also),--with horse, and hound, and hawk; and merry blast of the
trumpet.--Very strange creatures to be hunted, in all truth; but still creatures with a single
head, and that on their shoulders, which is exactly the last place in the Pavian church where
a head is to be looked for.

My good friend Mr. Cockerell wonders, in one of his lectures, why I give so much praise to
this "crazy front of Lucca." But it is not crazy; not by any means. Altogether sober, in comparison
with the early Lombard work, or with our Norman. Crazy in one sense it is: utterly neglected,
to the breaking of its old stout heart; the venomous nights and salt frosts of the Maremma
winters have their way with it--"Poor Tom's a cold!" The weeds that feed on the marsh air,
have twisted themselves into its crannies; the polished fragments of serpentine are spit and
rent out of their cells, and lie in green ruins along its ledges; the salt sea winds have eaten
away the fair shafting of its star window into a skeleton of crumbling rays. It cannot stand
much longer; may Heaven only, in its benignity, preserve it from restoration, and the sands
of the Serchio give it honorable grave.

In the "Seven Lamps," Plate VI., I gave a faithful drawing of one of its upper arches, to which
I must refer the reader; for there is a marked piece of character in the figure of the horseman
on the left of it. And in making this reference, I would say a few words about those much abused
plates of the "Seven Lamps." They are black, they are overbitten, they are hastily drawn, they
are coarse and disagreeable; how disagreeable to many readers I venture not to conceive. But
their truth is carried to an extent never before attempted in architectural drawing. It does
not in the least follow that because a drawing is delicate, or looks careful, it has been carefully
drawn from the thing represented; in nine instances out of ten, careful and delicate drawings
are made at home. It is not so easy as the reader, perhaps, imagines, to finish a drawing altogether
on the spot, especially of details seventy feet from the ground; and any one who will try the
position in which I have had to do some of my work--standing, namely, on a cornice or window
sill, holding by one arm round a shaft, and hanging over the street (or canal, at Venice),
with my sketch-book supported against the wall from which I was drawing, by my breast, so as
to leave my right hand free--will not thenceforward wonder that shadows should be occasionally
carelessly laid in, or lines drawn with some unsteadiness. But, steady, or infirm, the sketches
of which those plates in the "Seven Lamps" are fac-similes, were made from the architecture
itself, and represent that architecture with its actual shadows at the time of day at which
it was drawn, and with every fissure and line of it as they now exist; so that when I am speaking
of some new point, which perhaps the drawing was not intended to illustrate, I can yet turn
back to it with perfect certainty that if anything be found in it bearing on matters now in
hand, I may depend upon it just as securely as if I had gone back to look again at the building.

It is necessary that my readers should understand this thoroughly, and I did not before sufficiently
explain it; but I believe I can show them the use of this kind of truth, now that we are again
concerned with this front of Lucca. They will find a drawing of the entire front in Gally Knight's
"Architecture of Italy." It may serve to give them an idea of its general disposition, and
it looks very careful and accurate; but every bit of the ornament on it is drawn out of the
artist's head. There is not one line of it that exists on the building. The reader will therefore,
perhaps, think my ugly black plate of somewhat more value, upon the whole, in its rough veracity,
than the other in its delicate fiction.[97]

As, however, I made a drawing of another part of the church somewhat more delicately, and as
I do not choose that my favorite church should suffer in honor by my coarse work, I have had
this, as far as might be, fac-similied by line engraving (Plate XXI.). It represents the southern
side of the lower arcade of the west front; and may convey some idea of the exquisite finish
and grace of the whole; but the old plate, in the "Seven Lamps," gives a nearer view of one
of the upper arches, and a more faithful impression of the present aspect of the work, and
especially of the seats of the horsemen; the limb straight, and well down on the stirrup (the
warrior's seat, observe, not the jockey's), with a single pointed spur on the heel. The bit
of the lower cornice under this arch I could not see, and therefore had not drawn; it was supplied
from beneath another arch. I am afraid, however, the reader has lost the thread of my story
while I have been recommending my veracity to him. I was insisting upon the healthy tone of
this Lucca work as compared with the old spectral Lombard friezes. The apes of the Pavian church
ride without stirrups, but all is in good order and harness here: civilisation had done its
work; there was reaping of corn in the Val d'Arno, though rough hunting still upon its hills.
But in the north, though a century or two later, we find the forests of the Rhone, and its
rude limestone cotes, haunted by phantasms still (more meat-eating, then, I think). I do not
know a more interesting group of cathedrals than that of Lyons, Vienne, and Valencia: a more
interesting indeed, generally, than beautiful; but there is a row of niches on the west front
of Lyons, and a course of panelled decoration about its doors, which is, without exception,
the most exquisite piece of Northern Gothic I ever beheld, and with which I know nothing that
is even comparable, except the work of the north transept of Rouen, described in the "Seven
Lamps," p. 159; work of about the same date, and exactly the same plan; quatrefoils filled
with grotesques, but somewhat less finished in execution, and somewhat less wild in imagination.
I wrote down hastily, and in their own course, the subjects of some of the quatrefoils of Lyons;
of which I here give the reader the sequence:--

   1. Elephant and castle; less graphic than the St. Zeno one.

   2. A huge head walking on two legs, turned backwards, hoofed; the
        head has a horn behind, with drapery over it, which ends in
        another head.

   3. A boar hunt; the boar under a tree, very spirited.

   4. A bird putting its head between its legs to bite its own tail,
        which ends in a head.

   5. A dragon with a human head set on the wrong way.

   6. St. Peter awakened by the angel in prison; full of spirit, the
        prison picturesque, with a trefoiled arch, the angel eager, St.
        Peter startled, and full of motion.

   7. St. Peter led out by the angel.

   8. The miraculous draught of fishes; fish and all, in the small
        space.

   9. A large leaf, with two snails rampant, coming out of nautilus
        shells, with grotesque faces, and eyes at the ends of their
        horns.

  10. A man with an axe striking at a dog's head, which comes out of
        a nautilus shell: the rim of the shell branches into a stem
        with two large leaves.

  11. Martyrdom of St. Sebastian; his body very full of arrows.

  12. Beasts coming to ark; Noah opening a kind of wicker cage.

  13. Noah building the ark on shores.

  14. A vine leaf with a dragon's head and tail, the one biting the
        other.

  15. A man riding a goat, catching a flying devil.

  16. An eel or muraena growing into a bunch of flowers, which turns
        into two wings.

  17. A sprig of hazel, with nuts, thrown all around the quatrefoils
        with a squirrel in centre, apparently attached to the tree only
        by its enormous tail, richly furrowed into hair, and nobly
        sweeping.

  18. Four hares fastened together by the ears, galloping in a circle.
        Mingled with these grotesques are many sword and buckler
        combats, the bucklers being round and conical like a hat; I
        thought the first I noticed, carried by a man at full gallop on
        horseback, had been a small umbrella.

This list of subjects may sufficiently illustrate the feverish character of the Northern Energy;
but influencing the treatment of the whole there is also the Northern love of what is called
the Grotesque, a feeling which I find myself, for the present, quite incapable either of analysing
or defining, though we all have a distinct idea attached to the word: I shall try, however,
in the next volume.

  9. WOODEN CHURCHES OF THE NORTH.

I cannot pledge myself to this theory of the origin of the vaulting shaft, but the reader will
find some interesting confirmations of it in Dahl's work on the wooden churches of Norway.
The inside view of the church of Borgund shows the timber construction of one shaft run up
through a crossing architrave, and continued into the clerestory; while the church of Urnes
is in the exact form of a basilica; but the wall above the arches is formed of planks, with
a strong upright above each capital. The passage quoted from Stephen Eddy's Life of Bishop
Wilfrid, at p. 86 of Churton's "Early English Church," gives us one of the transformations
or petrifactions of the wooden Saxon churches. "At Ripon he built a new church of polished
stone, with columns variously ornamented, and porches." Mr. Churton adds: "It was perhaps in
bad imitation of the marble buildings he had seen in Italy, that he washed the walls of this
original York Minster, and made them 'whiter than snow.'"

  10. CHURCH OF ALEXANDRIA.

The very cause which enabled the Venetians to possess themselves of the body of St. Mark, was
the destruction of the church by the caliph for the sake of its marbles: the Arabs and Venetians,
though bitter enemies, thus building on the same models; these in reverence for the destroyed
church, and those with the very pieces of it. In the somewhat prolix account of the matter
given in the Notizie Storiche (above quoted) the main points are, that "il Califa de' Saraceni,
per fabbricarsi un Palazzo presse di Babilonia, aveva ordinato che dalle Chiese d' Cristiani
si togliessero i più scelti marmi;" and that the Venetians, "videro sotto i loro occhi flagellarsi
crudelmente un Cristiano per aver infranto un marmo." I heartily wish that the same kind of
punishment were enforced to this day, for the same sin.

  11. RENAISSANCE LANDSCAPE.

I am glad here to re-assert opinions which it has grieved me to be suspected of having changed.
The calmer tone of the second volume of "Modern Painters," as compared with the first, induced,
I believe, this suspicion, very justifiably, in the minds of many of its readers. The difference
resulted, however, from the simple fact, that the first was written in great haste and indignation,
for a special purpose and time;--the second, after I had got engaged, almost unawares, in inquiries
which could not be hastily nor indignantly pursued; my opinions remaining then, and remaining
now, altogether unchanged on the subject which led me into the discussion. And that no farther
doubt of them may be entertained by any who may think them worth questioning, I shall here,
once for all, express them in the plainest and fewest words I can. I think that J. M. W. Turner
is not only the greatest (professed) landscape painter who ever lived, but that he has in him
as much as would have furnished all the rest with such power as they had; and that if we put
Nicolo Poussin, Salvator, and our own Gainsborough out of the group, he would cut up into Claudes,
Cuyps, Ruysdaels, and such others, by uncounted bunches. I hope this is plainly and strongly
enough stated. And farther, I like his later pictures, up to the year 1845, the best; and believe
that those persons who only like his early pictures do not, in fact, like him at all. They
do not like that which is essentially his. They like that in which he resembles other men;
which he had learned from Loutherbourg, Claude, or Wilson; that which is indeed his own, they
do not care for. Not that there is not much of his own in his early works; they are all invaluable
in their way; but those persons who can find no beauty in his strangest fantasy on the Academy
walls, cannot distinguish the peculiarly Turneresque characters of the earlier pictures. And,
therefore, I again state here, that I think his pictures painted between the years 1830 and
1845 his greatest; and that his entire power is best represented by such pictures as the Temeraire,
the Sun of Venice going to Sea, and others, painted exactly at the time when the public and
the press were together loudest in abuse of him.

  Turner. Tintoret.
  Massaccio.
  John Bellini.
  Albert Durer.
  Giorgione.
  Paul Veronese.
  Titian.
  Rubens.
  Correggio.
  Orcagna.
  Benozzo Gozzoli.
  Giotto.
  Raffaelle.
  Perugino.

I desire, however, the reader to observe that I said, above, professed landscape painters,
among whom, perhaps, I should hardly have put Gainsborough. The landscape of the great figure
painters is often majestic in the highest degree, and Tintoret's especially shows exactly the
same power and feeling as Turner's. If with Turner I were to rank the historical painters as
landscapists, estimating rather the power they show, than the actual value of the landscape
they produced, I should class those, whose landscapes I have studied, in some such order as
this at the side of the page:--associating with the landscape of Perugino that of Francia and
Angelico, and the other severe painters of religious subjects. I have put Turner and Tintoret
side by side, not knowing which is, in landscape, the greater; I had nearly associated in the
same manner the noble names of John Bellini and Albert Durer; but Bellini must be put first,
for his profound religious peace yet not separated from the other, if but that we might remember
his kindness to him in Venice; and it is well we should take note of it here, for it furnishes
us with a most interesting confirmation of what was said in the text respecting the position
of Bellini as the last of the religious painters of Venice. The following passage is quoted
in Jackson's "Essay on Wood-engraving," from Albert Durer's Diary:

"I have many good friends among the Italians who warn me not to eat or drink with their painters,
of whom several are my enemies, and copy my picture in the church, and others of mine, wherever
they can find them, and yet they blame them, and say they are not according to ancient art,
and therefore not good. Giovanni Bellini, however, has praised me highly to several gentlemen,
and wishes to have something of my doing: he called on me himself, and requested that I would
paint a picture for him, for which, he said, he would pay me well. People are all surprised
that I should be so much thought of by a person of his reputation: he is very old, but is still
the best painter of them all."

A choice little piece of description this, of the Renaissance painters, side by side with the
good old Venetian, who was soon to leave them to their own ways. The Renaissance men are seen
in perfection, envying, stealing, and lying, but without wit enough to lie to purpose.

  12. ROMANIST MODERN ART.

It is of the highest importance, in these days, that Romanism should be deprived of the miserable
influence which its pomp and picturesqueness have given it over the weak sentimentalism of
the English people; I call it a miserable influence, for of all motives to sympathy with the
Church of Rome, this I unhesitatingly class as the basest: I can, in some measure, respect
the other feelings which have been the beginnings of apostasy; I can respect the desire for
unity which would reclaim the Romanist by love, and the distrust of his own heart which subjects
the proselyte to priestly power; I say I can respect these feelings, though I cannot pardon
unprincipled submission to them, nor enough wonder at the infinite fatuity of the unhappy persons
whom they have betrayed:--Fatuity, self-inflicted, and stubborn in resistance to God's Word
and man's reason!--to talk of the authority of the Church, as if the Church were anything else
than the whole company of Christian men, or were ever spoken of in Scripture[98] as other than
a company to be taught and fed, not to teach and feed.--Fatuity! to talk of a separation of
Church and State, as if a Christian state, and every officer therein, were not necessarily
a part of the Church,[99] and as if any state officer could do his duty without endeavoring
to aid and promote religion, or any clerical officer do his duty without seeking for such aid
and accepting it:--Fatuity! to seek for the unity of a living body of truth and trust in God,
with a dead body of lies and trust in wood, and thence to expect anything else than plague,
and consumption by worms undying, for both. Blasphemy as well as fatuity! to ask for any better
interpreter of God's Word than God, or to expect knowledge of it in any other way than the
plainly ordered way: if any man will do he shall know. But of all these fatuities, the basest
is the being lured into the Romanist Church by the glitter of it, like larks into a trap by
broken glass; to be blown into a change of religion by the whine of an organ-pipe; stitched
into a new creed by gold threads on priests' petticoats; jangled into a change of conscience
by the chimes of a belfry. I know nothing in the shape of error so dark as this, no imbecility
so absolute, no treachery so contemptible. I had hardly believed that it was a thing possible,
though vague stories had been told me of the effect, on some minds, of mere scarlet and candles,
until I came on this passage in Pugin's "Remarks on articles in the Rambler":--

"Those who have lived in want and privation are the best qualified to appreciate the blessings
of plenty; thus, those who have been devout and sincere members of the separated portion of
the English Church; who have prayed, and hoped, and loved, through all the poverty of the maimed
rites which it has retained--to them does the realisation of all their longing desires appear
truly ravishing. * * * Oh! then, what delight! what joy unspeakable! when one of the solemn
piles is presented to them, in all its pristine life and glory!--the stoups are filled to the
brim; the rood is raised on high; the screen glows with sacred imagery and rich device; the
niches are filled; the altar is replaced, sustained by sculptured shafts, the relics of the
saints repose beneath, the body of Our Lord is enshrined on its consecrated stone; the lamps
of the sanctuary burn bright; the saintly portraitures in the glass windows shine all gloriously;
and the albs hang in the oaken ambries, and the cope chests are filled with orphreyed baudekins;
and pix and pax, and chrismatory are there, and thurible, and cross."

One might have put this man under a pix, and left him, one should have thought; but he has
been brought forward, and partly received, as an example of the effect of ceremonial splendor
on the mind of a great architect. It is very necessary, therefore, that all those who have
felt sorrow at this should know at once that he is not a great architect, but one of the smallest
possible or conceivable architects; and that by his own account and setting forth of himself.
Hear him:--

"I believe, as regards architecture, few men have been so unfortunate as myself. I have passed
my life in thinking of fine things, studying fine things, designing fine things, and realising
very poor ones. I have never had the chance of producing a single fine ecclesiastical building,
except my own church, where I am both paymaster and architect; but everything else, either
for want of adequate funds or injudicious interference and control, or some other contingency,
is more or less a failure. * * *

"St. George's was spoilt by the very instructions laid down by the committee, that it was to
hold 3000 people on the floor at a limited price; in consequence, height, proportion, everything,
was sacrificed to meet these conditions. Nottingham was spoilt by the style being restricted
to lancet,--a period well suited to a Cistercian abbey in a secluded vale, but very unsuitable
for the centre of a crowded town. * * *

"Kirkham was spoilt through several hundred pounds being reduced on the original estimate;
to effect this, which was a great sum in proportion to the entire cost, the area of the church
was contracted, the walls lowered, tower and spire reduced, the thickness of walls diminished,
and stone arches omitted." (Remarks, &c., by A. Welby Pugin: Dolman, 1850.)

Is that so? Phidias can niche himself into the corner of a pediment, and Raffaelle expatiate
within the circumference of a clay platter; but Pugin is inexpressible in less than a cathedral?
Let his ineffableness be assured of this, once for all, that no difficulty or restraint ever
happened to a man of real power, but his power was the more manifested in the contending with,
or conquering it; and that there is no field so small, no cranny so contracted, but that a
great spirit can house and manifest itself therein. The thunder that smites the Alp into dust,
can gather itself into the width of a golden wire. Whatever greatness there was in you, had
it been Buonarroti's own, you had room enough for it in a single niche: you might have put
the whole power of it into two feet cube of Caen stone. St. George's was not high enough for
want of money? But was it want of money that made you put that blunt, overloaded, laborious
ogee door into the side of it? Was it for lack of funds that you sunk the tracery of the parapet
in its clumsy zigzags? Was it in parsimony that you buried its paltry pinnacles in that eruption
of diseased crockets? or in pecuniary embarrassment that you set up the belfry foolscaps, with
the mimicry of dormer windows, which nobody can ever reach nor look out of? Not so, but in
mere incapability of better things.

I am sorry to have to speak thus of any living architect; and there is much in this man, if
he were rightly estimated, which one might both regard and profit by. He has a most sincere
love for his profession, a heartily honest enthusiasm for pixes and piscinas; and though he
will never design so much as a pix or a piscina thoroughly well, yet better than most of the
experimental architects of the day. Employ him by all means, but on small work. Expect no cathedrals
from him; but no one, at present, can design a better finial. That is an exceedingly beautiful
one over the western door of St. George's; and there is some spirited impishness and switching
of tails in the supporting figures at the imposts. Only do not allow his good designing of
finials to be employed as an evidence in matters of divinity, nor thence deduce the incompatibility
of Protestantism and art. I should have said all that I have said above, of artistical apostasy,
if Giotto had been now living in Florence, and if art were still doing all that it did once
for Rome. But the grossness of the error becomes incomprehensible as well as unpardonable,
when we look to what level of degradation the human intellect has sunk at this instant in Italy.
So far from Romanism now producing anything greater in art, it cannot even preserve what has
been given to its keeping. I know no abuses of precious inheritance half so grievous, as the
abuse of all that is best in art wherever the Romanist priesthood gets possession of it. It
amounts to absolute infatuation. The noblest pieces of mediæval sculpture in North Italy, the
two griffins at the central (west) door of the cathedral of Verona, were daily permitted to
be brought into service, when I was there in the autumn of 1849, by a washerwoman living in
the Piazza, who tied her clothes-lines to their beaks: and the shafts of St. Mark's at Venice
were used by a salesman of common caricatures to fasten his prints upon (Compare Appendix 25);
and this in the face of the continually passing priests: while the quantity of noble art annually
destroyed in altarpieces by candle-droppings, or perishing by pure brutality of neglect, passes
all estimate. I do not know, as I have repeatedly stated, how far the splendor of architecture,
or other art, is compatible with the honesty and usefulness of religious service. The longer
I live, the more I incline to severe judgment in this matter, and the less I can trust the
sentiments excited by painted glass and colored tiles. But if there be indeed value in such
things, our plain duty is to direct our strength against the superstition which has dishonored
them; there are thousands who might possibly be benefited by them, to whom they are now merely
an offence, owing to their association with idolatrous ceremonies. I have but this exhortation
for all who love them,--not to regulate their creeds by their taste in colors, but to hold
calmly to the right, at whatever present cost to their imaginative enjoyment; sure that they
will one day find in heavenly truth a brighter charm than in earthly imagery, and striving
to gather stones for the eternal building, whose walls shall be salvation, and whose gates
shall be praise.

  13. MR. FERGUSSON'S SYSTEM.

The reader may at first suppose this division of the attributes of buildings into action, voice,
and beauty, to be the same division as Mr. Fergusson's, now well known, of their merits, into
technic, æsthetic and phonetic.

But there is no connection between the two systems; mine, indeed, does not profess to be a
system, it is a mere arrangement of my subject, for the sake of order and convenience in its
treatment: but, as far as it goes, it differs altogether from Mr. Fergusson's in these two
following respects:--

The action of a building, that is to say its standing or consistence, depends on its good construction;
and the first part of the foregoing volume has been entirely occupied with the consideration
of the constructive merit of buildings: but construction is not their only technical merit.
There is as much of technical merit in their expression, or in their beauty, as in their construction.
There is no more mechanical or technical admirableness in the stroke of the painter who covers
them with fresco, than in the dexterity of the mason who cements their stones: there is just
as much of what is technical in their beauty, therefore, as in their construction; and, on
the other hand, there is often just as much intellect shown in their construction as there
is in either their expression or decoration. Now Mr. Fergusson means by his "Phonetic" division,
whatever expresses intellect: my constructive division, therefore, includes part of his phonetic:
and my expressive and decorative divisions include part of his technical.

Secondly, Mr. Fergusson tries to make the same divisions fit the subjects of art, and art itself;
and therefore talks of technic, æsthetic, and phonetic, arts, (or, translating the Greek,)
of artful arts, sensitive arts, and talkative arts; but I have nothing to do with any division
of the arts, I have to deal only with the merits of buildings. As, however, I have been led
into reference to Mr. Fergusson's system, I would fain say a word or two to effect Mr. Fergusson's
extrication from it. I hope to find in him a noble ally, ready to join with me in war upon
affectation, falsehood, and prejudice, of every kind: I have derived much instruction from
his most interesting work, and I hope for much more from its continuation; but he must disentangle
himself from his system, or he will be strangled by it; never was anything so ingeniously and
hopelessly wrong throughout; the whole of it is founded on a confusion of the instruments of
man with his capacities.

Mr. Fergusson would have us take--

  "First, man's muscular action or power." (Technics.)

  "Secondly, those developments of sense by which he does!! as much
    as by his muscles." (Æsthetics.)

  "Lastly, his intellect, or to confine this more correctly to its
    external action, his power of speech!!!" (Phonetics.)

Granting this division of humanity correct, or sufficient, the writer then most curiously supposes
that he may arrange the arts as if there were some belonging to each division of man,--never
observing that every art must be governed by, and addressed to, one division, and executed
by another; executed by the muscular, addressed to the sensitive or intellectual; and that,
to be an art at all, it must have in it work of the one, and guidance from the other. If, by
any lucky accident, he had been led to arrange the arts, either by their objects, and the things
to which they are addressed, or by their means, and the things by which they are executed,
he would have discovered his mistake in an instant. As thus:--

  These arts are addressed to the,--Muscles!!
                                    Senses,
                                    Intellect;
                   or executed by,--Muscles,
                                    Senses!!
                                    Intellect.

Indeed it is true that some of the arts are in a sort addressed to the muscles, surgery for
instance; but this is not among Mr. Fergusson's technic, but his politic, arts! and all the
arts may, in a sort, be said to be performed by the senses, as the senses guide both muscles
and intellect in their work: but they guide them as they receive information, or are standards
of accuracy, but not as in themselves capable of action. Mr. Fergusson is, I believe, the first
person who has told us of senses that act or do, they having been hitherto supposed only to
sustain or perceive. The weight of error, however, rests just as much in the original division
of man, as in the endeavor to fit the arts to it. The slight omission of the soul makes a considerable
difference when it begins to influence the final results of the arrangement.

Mr. Fergusson calls morals and religion "Politick arts" (as if religion were an art at all!
or as if both were not as necessary to individuals as to societies); and therefore, forming
these into a body of arts by themselves, leaves the best of the arts to do without the soul
and the moral feeling as rest they may. Hence "expression," or "phonetics," is of intellect
only (as if men never expressed their feelings!); and then, strangest and worst of all, intellect
is entirely resolved into talking! There can be no intellect but it must talk, and all talking
must be intellectual. I believe people do sometimes talk without understanding; and I think
the world would fare ill if they never understood without talking. The intellect is an entirely
silent faculty, and has nothing to do with parts of speech any more than the moral part has.
A man may feel and know things without expressing either the feeling or knowledge; and the
talking is a muscular mode of communicating the workings of the intellect or heart--muscular,
whether it be by tongue or by sign, or by carving or writing, or by expression of feature;
so that to divide a man into muscular and talking parts, is to divide him into body in general,
and tongue in particular, the endless confusion resulting from which arrangement is only less
marvellous in itself, than the resolution with which Mr. Fergusson has worked through it, and
in spite of it, up to some very interesting and suggestive truths; although starting with a
division of humanity which does not in the least raise it above the brute, for a rattlesnake
has his muscular, æsthetic, and talking part as much as man, only he talks with his tail, and
says, "I am angry with you, and should like to bite you," more laconically and effectively
than any phonetic biped could, were he so minded. And, in fact, the real difference between
the brute and man is not so much that the one has fewer means of expression than the other,
as that it has fewer thoughts to express, and that we do not understand its expressions. Animals
can talk to one another intelligibly enough when they have anything to say, and their captains
have words of command just as clear as ours, and better obeyed. We have indeed, in watching
the efforts of an intelligent animal to talk to a human being, a melancholy sense of its dumbness;
but the fault is still in its intelligence, more than in its tongue. It has not wit enough
to systematise its cries or signs, and form them into language.

But there is no end to the fallacies and confusions of Mr. Fergusson's arrangement. It is a
perfect entanglement of gun-cotton, and explodes into vacuity wherever one holds a light to
it. I shall leave him to do so with the rest of it for himself, and should perhaps have left
it to his own handling altogether, but for the intemperateness of the spirit with which he
has spoken on a subject perhaps of all others demanding gentleness and caution. No man could
more earnestly have desired the changes lately introduced into the system of the University
of Oxford than I did myself: no man can be more deeply sensible than I of grievous failures
in the practical working even of the present system: but I believe that these failures may
be almost without exception traced to one source, the want of evangelical, and the excess of
rubrical religion among the tutors; together with such rustinesses and stiffnesses as necessarily
attend the continual operation of any intellectual machine. The fault is, at any rate, far
less in the system than in the imperfection of its administration; and had it been otherwise,
the terms in which Mr. Fergusson speaks of it are hardly decorous in one who can but be imperfectly
acquainted with its working. They are sufficiently answered by the structure of the essay in
which they occur; for if the high powers of mind which its author possesses had been subjected
to the discipline of the schools, he could not have wasted his time on the development of a
system which their simplest formulæ of logic would have shown him to be untenable.

Mr. Fergusson will, however, find it easier to overthrow his system than to replace it. Every
man of science knows the difficulty of arranging a reasonable system of classification, in
any subject, by any one group of characters; and that the best classifications are, in many
of their branches, convenient rather than reasonable: so that, to any person who is really
master of his subject, many different modes of classification will occur at different times;
one of which he will use rather than another, according to the point which he has to investigate.
I need only instance the three arrangements of minerals, by their external characters, and
their positive or negative bases, of which the first is the most useful, the second the most
natural, the third the most simple; and all in several ways unsatisfactory.

But when the subject becomes one which no single mind can grasp, and which embraces the whole
range of human occupation and enquiry, the difficulties become as great, and the methods as
various, as the uses to which the classification might be put; and Mr. Fergusson has entirely
forgotten to inform us what is the object to which his arrangements are addressed. For observe:
there is one kind of arrangement which is based on the rational connection of the sciences
or arts with one another; an arrangement which maps them out like the rivers of some great
country, and marks the points of their junction, and the direction and force of their united
currents; and this without assigning to any one of them a superiority above another, but considering
them all as necessary members of the noble unity of human science and effort. There is another
kind of classification which contemplates the order of succession in which they might most
usefully be presented to a single mind, so that the given mind should obtain the most effective
and available knowledge of them all: and, finally, the most usual classification contemplates
the powers of mind which they each require for their pursuit, the objects to which they are
addressed, or with which they are concerned; and assigns to each of them a rank superior or
inferior, according to the nobility of the powers they require, or the grandeur of the subjects
they contemplate.

Now, not only would it be necessary to adopt a different classification with respect to each
of these great intentions, but it might be found so even to vary the order of the succession
of sciences in the case of every several mind to which they were addressed; and that their
rank would also vary with the power and specific character of the mind engaged upon them. I
once heard a very profound mathematician remonstrate against the impropriety of Wordsworth's
receiving a pension from government, on the ground that he was "only a poet." If the study
of mathematics had always this narrowing effect upon the sympathies, the science itself would
need to be deprived of the rank usually assigned to it; and there could be no doubt that, in
the effect it had on the mind of this man, and of such others, it was a very contemptible science
indeed. Hence, in estimating the real rank of any art or science, it is necessary for us to
conceive it as it would be grasped by minds of every order. There are some arts and sciences
which we underrate, because no one has risen to show us with what majesty they may be invested;
and others which we overrate, because we are blinded to their general meanness by the magnificence
which some one man has thrown around them: thus, philology, evidently the most contemptible
of all the sciences, has been raised to unjust dignity by Johnson.[100] And the subject is
farther complicated by the question of usefulness; for many of the arts and sciences require
considerable intellectual power for their pursuit, and yet become contemptible by the slightness
of what they accomplish: metaphysics, for instance, exercising intelligence of a high order,
yet useless to the mass of mankind, and, to its own masters, dangerous. Yet, as it has become
so by the want of the true intelligence which its inquiries need, and by substitution of vain
subtleties in its stead, it may in future vindicate for itself a higher rank than a man of
common sense usually concedes to it.

Nevertheless, the mere attempt at arrangement must be useful, even where it does nothing more
than develop difficulties. Perhaps the greatest fault of men of learning is their so often
supposing all other branches of science dependent upon or inferior to their own best beloved
branch; and the greatest deficiency of men comparatively unlearned, their want of perception
of the connection of the branches with each other. He who holds the tree only by the extremities,
can perceive nothing but the separation of its sprays. It must always be desirable to prove
to those the equality of rank, to these the closeness of sequence, of what they had falsely
supposed subordinate or separate. And, after such candid admission of the co-equal dignity
of the truly noble arts and sciences, we may be enabled more justly to estimate the inferiority
of those which indeed seem intended for the occupation of inferior powers and narrower capacities.
In Appendix 14, following, some suggestions will be found as to the principles on which classification
might be based; but the arrangement of all the arts is certainly not a work which could with
discretion be attempted in the Appendix to an essay on a branch of one of them.

  14. DIVISIONS OF HUMANITY.

The reader will probably understand this part of the subject better if he will take the trouble
briefly to consider the actions of the mind and body of man in the sciences and arts, which
give these latter the relations of rank usually attributed to them.

It was above observed (Appendix 13) that the arts were generally ranked according to the nobility
of the powers they require, that is to say, the quantity of the being of man which they engaged
or addressed. Now their rank is not a very important matter as regards each other, for there
are few disputes more futile than that concerning the respective dignity of arts, all of which
are necessary and honorable. But it is a very important matter as regards themselves; very
important whether they are practised with the devotion and regarded with the respect which
are necessary or due to their perfection. It does not at all matter whether architecture or
sculpture be the nobler art; but it matters much whether the thought is bestowed upon buildings,
or the feeling is expressed in statues, which make either deserving of our admiration. It is
foolish and insolent to imagine that the art which we ourselves practise is greater than any
other; but it is wise to take care that in our own hands it is as noble as we can make it.
Let us take some notice, therefore, in what degrees the faculties of man may be engaged in
his several arts: we may consider the entire man as made up of body, soul, and intellect (Lord
Lindsay, meaning the same thing, says inaccurately--sense, intellect, and spirit--forgetting
that there is a moral sense as well as a bodily sense, and a spiritual body as well as a natural
body, and so gets into some awkward confusion, though right in the main points). Then, taking
the word soul as a short expression of the moral and responsible part of being, each of these
three parts has a passive and active power. The body has senses and muscles; the soul, feeling
and resolution; the intellect, understanding and imagination. The scheme may be put into tabular
form, thus:--

              Passive or Receptive Part.    Active or Motive Part. The sense of beauty I
consider a mixture of the Senses of the body and soul.

Now all these parts of the human system have a reciprocal action on one another, so that the
true perfection of any of them is not possible without some relative perfection of the others,
and yet any one of the parts of the system may be brought into a morbid development, inconsistent
with the perfection of the others. Thus, in a healthy state, the acuteness of the senses quickens
that of the feelings, and these latter quicken the understanding, and then all the three quicken
the imagination, and then all the four strengthen the resolution; while yet there is a danger,
on the other hand, that the encouraged and morbid feeling may weaken or bias the understanding,
or that the over shrewd and keen understanding may shorten the imagination, or that the understanding
and imagination together may take place of, or undermine, the resolution, as in Hamlet. So
in the mere bodily frame there is a delightful perfection of the senses, consistent with the
utmost health of the muscular system, as in the quick sight and hearing of an active savage:
another false delicacy of the senses, in the Sybarite, consequent on their over indulgence,
until the doubled rose-leaf is painful; and this inconsistent with muscular perfection. Again;
there is a perfection of muscular action consistent with exquisite sense, as in that of the
fingers of a musician or of a painter, in which the muscles are guided by the slightest feeling
of the strings, or of the pencil: another perfection of muscular action inconsistent with acuteness
of sense, as in the effort of battle, in which a soldier does not perceive his wounds. So that
it is never so much the question, what is the solitary perfection of a given part of the man,
as what is its balanced perfection in relation to the whole of him: and again, the perfection
of any single power is not merely to be valued by the mere rank of the power itself, but by
the harmony which it indicates among the other powers. Thus, for instance, in an archer's glance
along his arrow, or a hunter's raising of his rifle, there is a certain perfection of sense
and finger which is the result of mere practice, of a simple bodily perfection; but there is
a farther value in the habit which results from the resolution and intellect necessary to the
forming of it: in the hunter's raising of his rifle there is a quietness implying far more
than mere practice,--implying courage, and habitual meeting of danger, and presence of mind,
and many other such noble characters. So also in a musician's way of laying finger on his instrument,
or a painter's handling of his pencil, there are many qualities expressive of the special sensibilities
of each, operating on the production of the habit, besides the sensibility operating at the
moment of action. So that there are three distinct stages of merit in what is commonly called
mere bodily dexterity: the first, the dexterity given by practice, called command of tools
or of weapons; the second stage, the dexterity or grace given by character, as the gentleness
of hand proceeding from modesty or tenderness of spirit, and the steadiness of it resulting
from habitual patience coupled with decision, and the thousand other characters partially discernible,
even in a man's writing, much more in his general handiwork; and, thirdly, there is the perfection
of action produced by the operation of present strength, feeling, or intelligence on instruments
thus previously perfected, as the handling of a great painter is rendered more beautiful by
his immediate care and feeling and love of his subject, or knowledge of it, and as physical
strength is increased by strength of will and greatness of heart. Imagine, for instance, the
difference in manner of fighting, and in actual muscular strength and endurance, between a
common soldier, and a man in the circumstances of the Horatii, or of the temper of Leonidas.

Mere physical skill, therefore, the mere perfection and power of the body as an instrument,
is manifested in three stages:

  First, Bodily power by practice;
  Secondly, Bodily power by moral habit;
  Thirdly, Bodily power by immediate energy;

and the arts will be greater or less, cæteris paribus, according to the degrees of these dexterities
which they admit. A smith's work at his anvil admits little but the first; fencing, shooting,
and riding, admit something of the second; while the fine arts admit (merely through the channel
of the bodily dexterities) an expression almost of the whole man.

Nevertheless, though the higher arts admit this higher bodily perfection, they do not all require
it in equal degrees, but can dispense with it more and more in proportion to their dignity.
The arts whose chief element is bodily dexterity, may be classed together as arts of the third
order, of which the highest will be those which admit most of the power of moral habit and
energy, such as riding and the management of weapons; and the rest may be thrown together under
the general title of handicrafts, of which it does not much matter which are the most honorable,
but rather, which are the most necessary and least injurious to health, which it is not our
present business to examine. Men engaged in the practice of these are called artizans, as opposed
to artists, who are concerned with the fine arts.

The next step in elevation of art is the addition of the intelligences which have no connection
with bodily dexterity; as, for instance, in hunting, the knowledge of the habits of animals
and their places of abode; in architecture, of mathematics; in painting, of harmonies of color;
in music, of those of sound; all this pure science being joined with readiness of expedient
in applying it, and with shrewdness in apprehension of difficulties, either present or probable.

It will often happen that intelligence of this kind is possessed without bodily dexterity,
or the need of it; one man directing and another executing, as for the most part in architecture,
war, and seamanship. And it is to be observed, also, that in proportion to the dignity of the
art, the bodily dexterities needed even in its subordinate agents become less important, and
are more and more replaced by intelligence; as in the steering of a ship, the bodily dexterity
required is less than in shooting or fencing, but the intelligence far greater: and so in war,
the mere swordsmanship and marksmanship of the troops are of small importance in comparison
with their disposition, and right choice of the moment of action. So that arts of this second
order must be estimated, not by the quantity of bodily dexterity they require, but by the quantity
and dignity of the knowledge needed in their practice, and by the degree of subtlety needed
in bringing such knowledge into play. War certainly stands first in the general mind, not only
as the greatest of the arts which I have called of the second order, but as the greatest of
all arts. It is not, however, easy to distinguish the respect paid to the Power, from that
rendered to the Art of the soldier; the honor of victory being more dependent, in the vulgar
mind, on its results, than its difficulties. I believe, however, that taking into consideration
the greatness of the anxieties under which this art must be practised, the multitude of circumstances
to be known and regarded in it, and the subtleties both of apprehension and stratagem constantly
demanded by it, as well as the multiplicity of disturbing accidents and doubtful contingencies
against which it must make provision on the instant, it must indeed rank as far the first of
the arts of the second order; and next to this great art of killing, medicine being much like
war in its stratagems and watchings against its dark and subtle death-enemy.

Then the arts of the first order will be those in which the Imaginative part of the intellect
and the Sensitive part of the soul are joined: as poetry, architecture, and painting; these
forming a kind of cross, in their part of the scheme of the human being, with those of the
second order, which wed the Intelligent part of the intellect and Resolute part of the soul.
But the reader must feel more and more, at every step, the impossibility of classing the arts
themselves, independently of the men by whom they are practised; and how an art, low in itself,
may be made noble by the quantity of human strength and being which a great man will pour into
it; and an art, great in itself, be made mean by the meanness of the mind occupied in it. I
do not intend, when I call painting an art of the first, and war an art of the second, order,
to class Dutch landscape painters with good soldiers; but I mean, that if from such a man as
Napoleon we were to take away the honor of all that he had done in law and civil government,
and to give him the reputation of his soldiership only, his name would be less, if justly weighed,
than that of Buonarroti, himself a good soldier also, when need was. But I will not endeavor
to pursue the inquiry, for I believe that of all the arts of the first order it would be found
that all that a man has, or is, or can be, he can fully express in them, and give to any of
them, and find it not enough.

  15. INSTINCTIVE JUDGMENTS.

The same rapid judgment which I wish to enable the reader to form of architecture, may in some
sort also be formed of painting, owing to the close connection between execution and expression
in the latter; as between structure and expression in the former. We ought to be able to tell
good painting by a side glance as we pass along a gallery; and, until we can do so, we are
not fit to pronounce judgment at all: not that I class this easily visible excellence of painting
with the great expressional qualities which time and watchfulness only unfold. I have again
and again insisted on the supremacy of these last and shall always continue to do so. But I
perceive a tendency among some of the more thoughtful critics of the day to forget that the
business of a painter is to paint, and so altogether to despise those men, Veronese and Rubens
for instance, who were painters, par excellence, and in whom the expressional qualities are
subordinate. Now it is well, when we have strong moral or poetical feeling manifested in painting,
to mark this as the best part of the work; but it is not well to consider as a thing of small
account, the painter's language in which that feeling is conveyed, for if that language be
not good and lovely, the man may indeed be a just moralist or a great poet, but he is not a
painter, and it was wrong of him to paint. He had much better put his morality into sermons,
and his poetry into verse, than into a language of which he was not master. And this mastery
of the language is that of which we should be cognizant by a glance of the eye; and if that
be not found, it is wasted time to look farther: the man has mistaken his vocation, and his
expression of himself will be cramped by his awkward efforts to do what he was not fit to do.
On the other hand, if the man be a painter indeed, and have the gift of colors and lines, what
is in him will come from his hand freely and faithfully; and the language itself is so difficult
and so vast, that the mere possession of it argues the man is great, and that his works are
worth reading. So that I have never yet seen the case in which this true artistical excellence,
visible by the eye-glance, was not the index of some true expressional worth in the work. Neither
have I ever seen a good expressional work without high artistical merit: and that this is ever
denied is only owing to the narrow view which men are apt to take both of expression and of
art; a narrowness consequent on their own especial practice and habits of thought. A man long
trained to love the monk's visions of Fra Angelico, turns in proud and ineffable disgust from
the first work of Rubens which he encounters on his return across the Alps. But is he right
in his indignation? He has forgotten, that while Angelico prayed and wept in his olive shade,
there was different work doing in the dank fields of Flanders;--wild seas to be banked out;
endless canals to be dug, and boundless marshes to be drained; hard ploughing and harrowing
of the frosty clay; careful breeding of stout horses and fat cattle; close setting of brick
walls against cold winds and snow; much hardening of hands and gross stoutening of bodies in
all this; gross jovialities of harvest homes and Christmas feasts, which were to be the reward
of it; rough affections, and sluggish imagination; fleshy, substantial, ironshod humanities,
but humanities still; humanities which God had his eye upon, and which won, perhaps, here and
there, as much favor in his sight as the wasted aspects of the whispering monks of Florence
(Heaven forbid it should not be so, since the most of us cannot be monks, but must be ploughmen
and reapers still). And are we to suppose there is no nobility in Rubens' masculine and universal
sympathy with all this, and with his large human rendering of it, Gentleman though he was,
by birth, and feeling, and education, and place; and, when he chose, lordly in conception also?
He had his faults, perhaps great and lamentable faults, though more those of his time and his
country than his own; he has neither cloister breeding nor boudoir breeding, and is very unfit
to paint either in missals or annuals; but he has an open sky and wide-world breeding in him,
that we may not be offended with, fit alike for king's court, knight's camp, or peasant's cottage.
On the other hand, a man trained here in England, in our Sir Joshua school, will not and cannot
allow that there is any art at all in the technical work of Angelico. But he is just as wrong
as the other. Fra Angelico is as true a master of the art necessary to his purposes, as Rubens
was of that necessary for his. We have been taught in England to think there can be no virtue
but in a loaded brush and rapid hand; but if we can shake our common sense free of such teaching,
we shall understand that there is art also in the delicate point and in the hand which trembles
as it moves; not because it is more liable to err, but because there is more danger in its
error, and more at stake upon its precision. The art of Angelico, both as a colorist and a
draughtsman, is consummate; so perfect and beautiful, that his work may be recognised at any
distance by the rainbow-play and brilliancy of it: However closely it may be surrounded by
other works of the same school, glowing with enamel and gold, Angelico's may be told from them
at a glance, like so many huge pieces of opal lying among common marbles. So again with Giotto;
the Arena chapel is not only the most perfect expressional work, it is the prettiest piece
of wall decoration and fair color, in North Italy.

Now there is a correspondence of the same kind between the technical and expressional parts
of architecture;--not a true or entire correspondence, so that when the expression is best,
the building must be also best; but so much of correspondence as that good building is necessary
to good expression, comes before it, and is to be primarily looked for: and the more, because
the manner of building is capable of being determinately estimated and classed; but the expressional
character not so: we can at once determine the true value of technical qualities, we can only
approximate to the value of expressional qualities: and besides this, the looking for the technical
qualities first will enable us to cast a large quantity of rubbish aside at once, and so to
narrow the difficult field of inquiry into expression: we shall get rid of Chinese pagodas
and Indian temples, and Renaissance Palladianisms, and Alhambra stucco and filigree, in one
great rubbish heap; and shall not need to trouble ourselves about their expression, or anything
else concerning them. Then taking the buildings which have been rightly put together, and which
show common sense in their structure, we may look for their farther and higher excellences;
but on those which are absurd in their first steps we need waste no time.

  16. STRENGTH OF SHAFTS.

I could have wished, before writing this chapter, to have given more study to the difficult
subject of the strength of shafts of different materials and structure; but I cannot enter
into every inquiry which general criticism might suggest, and this I believe to be one which
would have occupied the reader with less profit than many others: all that is necessary for
him to note is, that the great increase of strength gained by a tubular form in iron shafts,
of given solid contents, is no contradiction to the general principle stated in the text, that
the strength of materials is most available when they are most concentrated. The strength of
the tube is owing to certain properties of the arch formed by its sides, not to the dispersion
of its materials: and the principle is altogether inapplicable to stone shafts. No one would
think of building a pillar of a succession of sandstone rings; however strong it might be,
it would be still stronger filled up, and the substitution of such a pillar for a solid one
of the same contents would lose too much space; for a stone pillar, even when solid, must be
quite as thick as is either graceful or convenient, and in modern churches is often too thick
as it is, hindering sight of the preacher, and checking the sound of his voice.

  17. ANSWER TO MR. GARBETT.

Some three months ago, and long after the writing of this passage, I met accidentally with
Mr. Garbett's elementary Treatise on Design. (Weale, 1850.) If I had cared about the reputation
of originality, I should have been annoyed--and was so, at first, on finding Mr. Garbett's
illustrations of the subject exactly the same as mine, even to the choice of the elephant's
foot for the parallel of the Doric pillar: I even thought of omitting, or rewriting, great
part of the chapter, but determined at last to let it stand. I am striving to speak plain truths
on many simple and trite subjects, and I hope, therefore, that much of what I say has been
said before, and am quite willing to give up all claim to originality in any reasoning or assertion
whatsoever, if any one cares to dispute it. I desire the reader to accept what I say, not as
mine, but as the truth, which may be all the world's, if they look for it. If I remember rightly,
Mr. Frank Howard promised at some discussion respecting the "Seven Lamps," reported in the
"Builder," to pluck all my borrowed feathers off me; but I did not see the end of the discussion,
and do not know to this day how many feathers I have left: at all events the elephant's foot
must belong to Mr. Garbett, though, strictly speaking, neither he nor I can be quite justified
in using it, for an elephant in reality stands on tiptoe; and this is by no means the expression
of a Doric shaft. As, however, I have been obliged to speak of this treatise of Mr. Garbett's,
and desire also to recommend it as of much interest and utility in its statements of fact,
it is impossible for me to pass altogether without notice, as if unanswerable, several passages
in which the writer has objected to views stated in the "Seven Lamps." I should at any rate
have noticed the passage quoted above, (Chap. 30th,) which runs counter to the spirit of all
I have ever written, though without referring to me; but the references to the "Seven Lamps"
I should not have answered, unless I had desired, generally, to recommend the book, and partly
also, because they may serve as examples of the kind of animadversion which the "Seven Lamps"
had to sustain from architects, very generally; which examples being once answered, there will
be little occasion for my referring in future to other criticisms of the kind.

The first reference to the "Seven Lamps" is in the second page, where Mr. Garbett asks a question,
"Why are not convenience and stability enough to constitute a fine building?"--which I should
have answered shortly by asking another, "Why we have been made men, and not bees nor termites:"
but Mr. Garbett has given a very pretty, though partial, answer to it himself, in his 4th to
9th pages,--an answer which I heartily beg the reader to consider. But, in page 12, it is made
a grave charge against me, that I use the words beauty and ornament interchangeably. I do so,
and ever shall; and so, I believe, one day, will Mr. Garbett himself; but not while he continues
to head his pages thus:--"Beauty not dependent on ornament, or superfluous features." What
right has he to assume that ornament, rightly so called, ever was, or can be, superfluous?
I have said before, and repeatedly in other places, that the most beautiful things are the
most useless; I never said superfluous. I said useless in the well-understood and usual sense,
as meaning, inapplicable to the service of the body. Thus I called peacocks and lilies useless;
meaning, that roast peacock was unwholesome (taking Juvenal's word for it), and that dried
lilies made bad hay: but I do not think peacocks superfluous birds, nor that the world could
get on well without its lilies. Or, to look closer, I suppose the peacock's blue eyes to be
very useless to him; not dangerous indeed, as to their first master, but of small service,
yet I do not think there is a superfluous eye in all his tail; and for lilies, though the great
King of Israel was not "arrayed" like one of them, can Mr. Garbett tell us which are their
superfluous leaves? Is there no Diogenes among lilies? none to be found content to drink dew,
but out of silver? The fact is, I never met with the architect yet who did not think ornament
meant a thing to be bought in a shop and pinned on, or left off, at architectural toilets,
as the fancy seized them, thinking little more than many women do of the other kind of ornament--the
only true kind,--St. Peter's kind,--"Not that outward adorning, but the inner--of the heart."
I do not mean that architects cannot conceive this better ornament, but they do not understand
that it is the only ornament; that all architectural ornament is this, and nothing but this;
that a noble building never has any extraneous or superfluous ornament; that all its parts
are necessary to its loveliness, and that no single atom of them could be removed without harm
to its life. You do not build a temple and then dress it.[101] You create it in its loveliness,
and leave it, as her Maker left Eve. Not unadorned, I believe, but so well adorned as to need
no feather crowns. And I use the words ornament and beauty interchangeably, in order that architects
may understand this: I assume that their building is to be a perfect creature capable of nothing
less than it has, and needing nothing more. It may, indeed, receive additional decoration afterwards,
exactly as a woman may gracefully put a bracelet on her arm, or set a flower in her hair: but
that additional decoration is not the architecture. It is of curtains, pictures, statues, things
that may be taken away from the building, and not hurt it. What has the architect to do with
these? He has only to do with what is part of the building itself, that is to say, its own
inherent beauty. And because Mr. Garbett does not understand or acknowledge this, he is led
on from error to error; for we next find him endeavoring to define beauty as distinct from
ornament, and saying that "Positive beauty may be produced by a studious collation of whatever
will display design, order, and congruity." (p. 14.) Is that so? There is a highly studious
collation of whatever will display design, order, and congruity, in a skull, is there not?--yet
small beauty. The nose is a decorative feature,--yet slightly necessary to beauty, it seems
to me; now, at least, for I once thought I must be wrong in considering a skull disagreeable.
I gave it fair trial: put one on my bed-room chimney-piece, and looked at it by sunrise every
morning, and by moonlight every night, and by all the best lights I could think of, for a month,
in vain. I found it as ugly at last as I did at first. So, also, the hair is a decoration,
and its natural curl is of little use; but can Mr. Garbett conceive a bald beauty; or does
he prefer a wig, because that is a "studious collation" of whatever will produce design, order,
and congruity? So the flush of the cheek is a decoration,--God's painting of the temple of
his spirit,--and the redness of the lip; and yet poor Viola thought it beauty truly blent;
and I hold with her.

I have answered enough to this count.

The second point questioned is my assertion, "Ornament cannot be overcharged if it is good,
and is always overcharged when it is bad." To which Mr. Garbett objects in these terms: "I
must contend, on the contrary, that the very best ornament may be overcharged by being misplaced."

A short sentence with two mistakes in it.

First. Mr. Garbett cannot get rid of his unfortunate notion that ornament is a thing to be
manufactured separately, and fastened on. He supposes that an ornament may be called good in
itself, in the stonemason's yard or in the ironmonger's shop: Once for all, let him put this
idea out of his head. We may say of a thing, considered separately, that it is a pretty thing;
but before we can say it is a good ornament, we must know what it is to adorn, and how. As,
for instance, a ring of gold is a pretty thing; it is a good ornament on a woman's finger;
not a good ornament hung through her under lip. A hollyhock, seven feet high, would be a good
ornament for a cottage-garden; not a good ornament for a lady's head-dress. Might not Mr. Garbett
have seen this without my showing? and that, therefore, when I said "good" ornament, I said
"well-placed" ornament, in one word, and that, also, when Mr. Garbett says "it may be overcharged
by being misplaced," he merely says it may be overcharged by being bad.

Secondly. But, granted that ornament were independent of its position, and might be pronounced
good in a separate form, as books are good, or men are good.--Suppose I had written to a student
in Oxford, "You cannot have too many books, if they be good books;" and he had answered me,
"Yes, for if I have many, I have no place to put them in but the coal-cellar." Would that in
anywise affect the general principle that he could not have too many books?

Or suppose he had written, "I must not have too many, they confuse my head." I should have
written back to him: "Don't buy books to put in the coal-hole, nor read them if they confuse
your head; you cannot have too many, if they be good: but if you are too lazy to take care
of them, or too dull to profit by them, you are better without them."

Exactly in the same tone, I repeat to Mr. Garbett, "You cannot have too much ornament, if it
be good: but if you are too indolent to arrange it, or too dull to take advantage of it, assuredly
you are better without it."

The other points bearing on this question have already been stated in the close of the 21st
chapter.

The third reference I have to answer, is to my repeated assertion, that the evidence of manual
labor is one of the chief sources of value in ornament, ("Seven Lamps," p. 49, "Modern Painters,"
§ 1, Chap. III.,) to which objection is made in these terms: "We must here warn the reader
against a remarkable error of Ruskin. The value of ornaments in architecture depends not in
the slightest degree on the manual labor they contain. If it did, the finest ornaments ever
executed would be the stone chains that hang before certain Indian rock-temples." Is that so?
Hear a parallel argument. "The value of the Cornish mines depends not in the slightest degree
on the quantity of copper they contain. If it did, the most valuable things ever produced would
be copper saucepans." It is hardly worth my while to answer this; but, lest any of my readers
should be confused by the objection, and as I hold the fact to be of great importance, I may
re-state it for them with some explanation.

Observe, then, the appearance of labor, that is to say, the evidence of the past industry of
man, is always, in the abstract, intensely delightful: man being meant to labor, it is delightful
to see that he has labored, and to read the record of his active and worthy existence.

The evidence of labor becomes painful only when it is a sign of Evil greater, as Evil, than
the labor is great, as Good. As, for instance, if a man has labored for an hour at what might
have been done by another man in a moment, this evidence of his labor is also evidence of his
weakness; and this weakness is greater in rank of evil, than his industry is great in rank of good.

Again, if a man have labored at what was not worth accomplishing, the signs of his labor are
the signs of his folly, and his folly dishonors his industry; we had rather he had been a wise
man in rest than a fool in labor.

Again, if a man have labored without accomplishing anything, the signs of his labor are the
signs of his disappointment; and we have more sorrow in sympathy with his failure, than pleasure
in sympathy with his work.

Now, therefore, in ornament, whenever labor replaces what was better than labor, that is to
say, skill and thought; wherever it substitutes itself for these, or negatives these by its
existence, then it is positive evil. Copper is an evil when it alloys gold, or poisons food:
not an evil, as copper; good in the form of pence, seriously objectionable when it occupies
the room of guineas. Let Danaë cast it out of her lap, when the gold comes from heaven; but
let the poor man gather it up carefully from the earth.

Farther, the evidence of labor is not only a good when added to other good, but the utter absence
of it destroys good in human work. It is only good for God to create without toil; that which
man can create without toil is worthless: machine ornaments are no ornaments at all. Consider
this carefully, reader: I could illustrate it for you endlessly; but you feel it yourself every
hour of your existence. And if you do not know that you feel it, take up, for a little time,
the trade which of all manual trades has been most honored: be for once a carpenter. Make for
yourself a table or a chair, and see if you ever thought any table or chair so delightful,
and what strange beauty there will be in their crooked limbs.

I have not noticed any other animadversions on the "Seven Lamps" in Mr. Garbett's volume; but
if there be more, I must now leave it to his own consideration, whether he may not, as in the
above instances, have made them incautiously: I may, perhaps, also be permitted to request
other architects, who may happen to glance at the preceding pages, not immediately to condemn
what may appear to them false in general principle. I must often be found deficient in technical
knowledge; I may often err in my statements respecting matters of practice or of special law.
But I do not write thoughtlessly respecting principles; and my statements of these will generally
be found worth reconnoitring before attacking. Architects, no doubt, fancy they have strong
grounds for supposing me wrong when they seek to invalidate my assertions. Let me assure them,
at least, that I mean to be their friend, although they may not immediately recognise me as
such. If I could obtain the public ear, and the principles I have advocated were carried into
general practice, porphyry and serpentine would be given to them instead of limestone and brick;
instead of tavern and shop-fronts they would have to build goodly churches and noble dwelling-houses;
and for every stunted Grecism and stucco Romanism, into which they are now forced to shape
their palsied thoughts, and to whose crumbling plagiarisms they must trust their doubtful fame,
they would be asked to raise whole streets of bold, and rich, and living architecture, with
the certainty in their hearts of doing what was honorable to themselves, and good for all men.

Before I altogether leave the question of the influence of labor on architectural effect, the
reader may expect from me a word or two respecting the subject which this year must be interesting
to all--the applicability, namely, of glass and iron to architecture in general, as in some
sort exemplified by the Crystal Palace.

It is thought by many that we shall forthwith have great part of our architecture in glass
and iron, and that new forms of beauty will result from the studied employment of these materials.

It may be told in a few words how far this is possible; how far eternally impossible.

There are two means of delight in all productions of art--color and form.

The most vivid conditions of color attainable by human art are those of works in glass and
enamel, but not the most perfect. The best and noblest coloring possible to art is that attained
by the touch of the human hand on an opaque surface, upon which it can command any tint required,
without subjection to alteration by fire or other mechanical means. No color is so noble as
the color of a good painting on canvas or gesso.

This kind of color being, however, impossible, for the most part, in architecture, the next
best is the scientific disposition of the natural colors of stones, which are far nobler than
any abstract hues producible by human art.

The delight which we receive from glass painting is one altogether inferior, and in which we
should degrade ourselves by over indulgence. Nevertheless, it is possible that we may raise
some palaces like Aladdin's with colored glass for jewels, which shall be new in the annals
of human splendor, and good in their place; but not if they superseded nobler edifices.

Now, color is producible either on opaque or in transparent bodies: but form is only expressible,
in its perfection, on opaque bodies, without lustre.

This law is imperative, universal, irrevocable. No perfect or refined form can be expressed
except in opaque and lustreless matter. You cannot see the form of a jewel, nor, in any perfection,
even of a cameo or bronze. You cannot perfectly see the form of a humming-bird, on account
of its burnishing; but you can see the form of a swan perfectly. No noble work in form can
ever, therefore, be produced in transparent or lustrous glass or enamel. All noble architecture
depends for its majesty on its form: therefore you can never have any noble architecture in
transparent or lustrous glass or enamel. Iron is, however, opaque; and both it and opaque enamel
may, perhaps, be rendered quite lustreless; and, therefore, fit to receive noble form.

Let this be thoroughly done, and both the iron and enamel made fine in paste or grain, and
you may have an architecture as noble as cast or struck architecture even can be: as noble,
therefore, as coins can be, or common cast bronzes, and such other multiplicable things;[102]--eternally
separated from all good and great things by a gulph which not all the tubular bridges nor engineering
of ten thousand nineteenth centuries cast into one great bronze-foreheaded century, will ever
overpass one inch of. All art which is worth its room in this world, all art which is not a
piece of blundering refuse, occupying the foot or two of earth which, if unencumbered by it,
would have grown corn or violets, or some better thing, is art which proceeds from an individual
mind, working through instruments which assist, but do not supersede, the muscular action of
the human hand, upon the materials which most tenderly receive, and most securely retain, the
impressions of such human labor.

And the value of every work of art is exactly in the ratio of the quantity of humanity which
has been put into it, and legibly expressed upon it for ever:--

First, of thought and moral purpose;

Secondly, of technical skill;

Thirdly, of bodily industry.

The quantity of bodily industry which that Crystal Palace expresses is very great. So far it
is good.

The quantity of thought it expresses is, I suppose, a single and very admirable thought of
Mr. Paxton's, probably not a bit brighter than thousands of thoughts which pass through his
active and intelligent brain every hour,--that it might be possible to build a greenhouse larger
than ever greenhouse was built before. This thought, and some very ordinary algebra, are as
much as all that glass can represent of human intellect. "But one poor half-pennyworth of bread
to all this intolerable deal of sack." Alas!

  "The earth hath bubbles as the water hath:
   And this is of them."

  18. EARLY ENGLISH CAPITALS.

The depth of the cutting in some of the early English capitals is, indeed, part of a general
system of attempts at exaggerated force of effect, like the "black touches" of second-rate
draughtsmen, which I have noticed as characteristic of nearly all northern work, associated
with the love of the grotesque: but the main section of the capital is indeed a dripstone rolled
round, as above described; and dripstone sections are continually found in northern work, where
not only they cannot increase force of effect, but are entirely invisible except on close examination;
as, for instance, under the uppermost range of stones of the foundation of Whitehall, or under
the slope of the restored base of All Souls College, Oxford, under the level of the eye. I
much doubt if any of the Fellows be aware of its existence.

Many readers will be surprised and displeased by the disparagement of the early English capital.
That capital has, indeed, one character of considerable value; namely, the boldness with which
it stops the mouldings which fall upon it, and severs them from the shaft, contrasting itself
with the multiplicity of their vertical lines. Sparingly used, or seldom seen, it is thus,
in its place, not unpleasing; and we English love it from association, it being always found
in connection with our purest and loveliest Gothic arches, and never in multitudes large enough
to satiate the eye with its form. The reader who sits in the Temple church every Sunday, and
sees no architecture during the week but that of Chancery Lane, may most justifiably quarrel
with me for what I have said of it. But if every house in Fleet Street or Chancery Lane were
Gothic, and all had early English capitals, I would answer for his making peace with me in
a fortnight.

  19. TOMBS NEAR ST. ANASTASIA.

Whose they are, is of little consequence to the reader or to me, and I have taken no pains
to discover; their value being not in any evidence they bear respecting dates, but in their
intrinsic merit as examples of composition. Two of them are within the gate, one on the top
of it, and this latter is on the whole the best, though all are beautiful; uniting the intense
northern energy in their figure sculpture with the most serene classical restraint in their
outlines, and unaffected, but masculine simplicity of construction.

I have not put letters to the diagram of the lateral arch at page 154, in order not to interfere
with the clearness of the curves, but I shall always express the same points by the same letters,
whenever I have to give measures of arches of this simple kind, so that the reader need never
have the diagrams lettered at all. The base or span of the centre arch will always be a b;
its vertex will always be V; the points of the cusps will be c c; p p will be the bases of
perpendiculars let fall from V and c on a b; and d the base of a perpendicular from the point
of the cusp to the arch line. Then a b will always be a span of the arch, V p its perpendicular
height, V a the chord of its side arcs, d c the depth of its cusps, c c the horizontal interval
between the cusps, a c the length of the chord of the lower arc of the cusp, V c the length
of the chord of the upper arc of the cusp, (whether continuous or not,) and c p the length
of a perpendicular from the point of the cusp on a b.

Of course we do not want all these measures for a single arch, but it often happens that some
of them are attainable more easily than others; some are often unattainable altogether, and
it is necessary therefore to have expressions for whichever we may be able to determine.

V p or V a, a b, and d c are always essential; then either a c and V c or c c and c p: when
I have my choice, I always take a b, V p, d c, c c, and c p, but c p is not to be generally
obtained so accurately as the cusp arcs.

The measures of the present arch are:

           Ft.  In.
  a b,    3 ,, 8
  V p,    4 ,, 0
  V c,    2 ,, 4-1/2
  a c,    2 ,, 0-1/4
  d c,    0 ,, 3-1/2

                   20. SHAFTS OF DUCAL PALACE.

The shortness of the thicker ones at the angles is induced by the greater depth of the enlarged
capitals: thus the 36th shaft is 10 ft. 4-1/3 in. in circumference at its base, and 10 ,, 0-1/2[103]
in circumference under the fillet of its capital; but it is only 6 ,, 1-3/4 high, while the
minor intermediate shafts, of which the thickest is 7 ,, 8 round at the base, and 7 ,, 4 under
capital, are yet on the average 7 ,, 7 high. The angle shaft towards the sea (the 18th) is
nearly of the proportions of the 36th, and there are three others, the 15th, 24th, and 26th,
which are thicker than the rest, though not so thick as the angle ones. The 24th and 26th have
both party walls to bear, and I imagine the 15th must in old time have carried another, reaching
across what is now the Sala del Gran Consiglio.

They measure respectively round at the base,

  The 15th, 8 ,, 2
      24th, 9 ,, 6-1/2
      26th, 8 ,, 0-1/2

The other pillars towards the sea, and those to the 27th inclusive of the Piazzetta, are all
seven feet round at the base, and then there is a most curious and delicate crescendo of circumference
to the 36th, thus:

  The 28th, 7 ,, 3   The 33rd, 7 ,, 6
      29th, 7 ,, 4       34th, 7 ,, 8
      30th, 7 ,, 6       35th, 7 ,, 8
      31st, 7 ,, 7       36th, 10 ,, 4-1/3
      32nd, 7 ,, 5

The shafts of the upper arcade, which are above these thicker columns, are also thicker than
their companions, measuring on the average, 4 ,, 8-1/2 in circumference, while those of the
sea façade, except the 29th, average 4 ,, 7-1/2 in circumference. The 29th, which is of course
above the 15th of the lower story, is 5 ,, 5 in circumference, which little piece of evidence
will be of no small value to us by-and-by. The 35th carries the angle of the palace, and is
6 ,, 0 round. The 47th, which comes above the 24th and carries the party wall of the Sala del
Gran Consiglio, is strengthened by a pilaster; and the 51st, which comes over the 26th, is
5 ,, 4-1/2 round, or nearly the same as the 29th; it carries the party wall of the Sala del
Scrutinio; a small room containing part of St. Mark's library, coming between the two saloons;
a room which, in remembrances of the help I have received in all my inquiries from the kindness
and intelligence of its usual occupant, I shall never easily distinguish otherwise than as
"Mr. Lorenzi's."[104]

I may as well connect with these notes respecting the arcades of the Ducal Palace, those which
refer to Plate XIV., which represents one of its spandrils. Every spandril of the lower arcade
was intended to have been occupied by an ornament resembling the one given in that plate. The
mass of the building being of Istrian stone, a depth of about two inches is left within the
mouldings of the arches, rough hewn, to receive the slabs of fine marble composing the patterns.
I cannot say whether the design was ever completed, or the marbles have been since removed,
but there are now only two spandrils retaining their fillings, and vestiges of them in a third.
The two complete spandrils are on the sea façade, above the 3rd and 10th capitals (vide method
of numbering, Chap. I., page 30); that is to say, connecting the 2nd arch with the 3rd, and
the 9th with the 10th. The latter is the one given in Plate XIV. The white portions of it are
all white marble, the dental band surrounding the circle is in coarse sugary marble, which
I believe to be Greek, and never found in Venice to my recollection, except in work at least
anterior to the fifteenth century. The shaded fields charged with the three white triangles
are of red Verona marble; the inner disc is green serpentine, and the dark pieces of the radiating
leaves are grey marble. The three triangles are equilateral. The two uppermost are 1 ,, 5 each
side, and the lower 1 ,, 2.

The extreme diameter of the circle is 3 ,, 10-1/2; its field is slightly raised above the red
marbles, as shown in the section at A, on the left. A a is part of the red marble field; a
b the section of the dentil moulding let into it; b c the entire breadth of the rayed zone,
represented on the other side of the spandril by the line C f; c d is the white marble band
let in, with the dogtooth on the face of it; b c is 7-3/4 inches across; c d 3-3/4; and at
B are given two joints of the dentil (mentioned above, in the chapter on dentils, as unique
in Venice) of their actual size. At C is given one of the inlaid leaves; its measure being
(in inches) C f 7-3/4; C h 3/4; f g 3/4; f e 4-3/4, the base of the smaller leaves being of
course f e - f g = 4. The pattern which occupies the other spandril is similar, except that
the field b c, instead of the intersecting arcs, has only triangles of grey marble, arranged
like rays, with their bases towards the centre. There being twenty round the circle, the reader
can of course draw them for himself; they being isosceles, touching the dentil with their points,
and being in contact at their bases: it has lost its central boss. The marbles are, in both,
covered with a rusty coating, through which it is excessively difficult to distinguish the
colors (another proof of the age of the ornament). But the white marbles are certainly, in
places (except only the sugary dentil), veined with purple, and the grey seem warmed with green.

A trace of another of these ornaments may be seen over the 21st capital; but I doubt if the
marbles have ever been inserted in the other spandrils, and their want of ornament occasions
the slight meagreness in the effect of the lower story, which is almost the only fault of the
building.

This decoration by discs, or shield-like ornaments, is a marked characteristic of Venetian
architecture in its earlier ages, and is carried into later times by the Byzantine Renaissance,
already distinguished from the more corrupt forms of Renaissance, in Appendix 6. Of the disc
decoration, so borrowed, we have already an example in Plate I. In Plate VII. we have an earlier
condition of it, one of the discs being there sculptured, the others surrounded by sculptured
bands: here we have, on the Ducal Palace, the most characteristic of all, because likest to
the shield, which was probably the origin of the same ornament among the Arabs, and assuredly
among the Greeks. In Mr. Donaldson's restoration of the gate of the treasury of Atreus, this
ornament is conjecturally employed, and it occurs constantly on the Arabian buildings of Cairo.

  21. ANCIENT REPRESENTATIONS OF WATER.

I have long been desirous of devoting some time to an enquiry into the effect of natural scenery
upon the pagan, and especially the Greek, mind, and knowing that my friend, Mr. C. Newton,
had devoted much thought to the elucidation of the figurative and symbolic language of ancient
art, I asked him to draw up for me a few notes of the facts which he considered most interesting,
as illustrative of its methods of representing nature. I suggested to him, for an initiative
subject, the representation of water; because this is one of the natural objects whose portraiture
may most easily be made a test of treatment, for it is one of universal interest, and of more
closely similar aspect in all parts of the world than any other. Waves, currents, and eddies
are much liker each other, everywhere, than either land or vegetation. Rivers and lakes, indeed,
differ widely from the sea, and the clear Pacific from the angry Northern ocean; but the Nile
is liker the Danube than a knot of Nubian palms is to a glade of the Black Forest; and the
Mediterranean is liker the Atlantic than the Campo Felice is like Solway moss.

Mr. Newton has accordingly most kindly furnished me with the following data. One or two of
the types which he describes have been already noticed in the main text; but it is well that
the reader should again contemplate them in the position which they here occupy in a general
system. I recommend his special attention to Mr. Newton's definitions of the terms "figurative"
and "symbolic," as applied to art, in the beginning of the paper.

       *       *       *       *       *

In ancient art, that is to say, in the art of the Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, and Roman races,
water is, for the most part, represented conventionally rather than naturally.

By natural representation is here meant as just and perfect an imitation of nature as the technical
means of art will allow: on the other hand, representation is said to be conventional, either
when a confessedly inadequate imitation is accepted in default of a better, or when imitation
is not attempted at all, and it is agreed that other modes of representation, those by figures
or by symbols, shall be its substitute and equivalent.

In figurative representation there is always impersonation; the sensible form, borrowed by
the artist from organic life, is conceived to be actuated by a will, and invested with such
mental attributes as constitute personality.

The sensible symbol, whether borrowed from organic or from inorganic nature, is not a personification
at all, but the conventional sign or equivalent of some object or notion, to which it may perhaps
bear no visible resemblance, but with which the intellect or the imagination has in some way
associated it.

For instance, a city may be figuratively represented as a woman crowned with towers; here the
artist has selected for the expression of his idea a human form animated with a will and motives
of action analogous to those of humanity generally. Or, again, as in Greek art, a bull may
be a figurative representation of a river, and, in the conception of the artist, this animal
form may contain, and be ennobled by, a human mind.

This is still impersonation; the form only in which personality is embodied is changed.

Again, a dolphin may be used as a symbol of the sea; a man ploughing with two oxen is a well-known
symbol of a Roman colony. In neither of these instances is there impersonation. The dolphin
is not invested, like the figure of Neptune, with any of the attributes of the human mind;
it has animal instincts, but no will; it represents to us its native element, only as a part
may be taken for a whole.

Again, the man ploughing does not, like the turreted female figure, personify, but rather typifies
the town, standing as the visible representation of a real event, its first foundation. To
our mental perceptions, as to our bodily senses, this figure seems no more than man; there
is no blending of his personal nature with the impersonal nature of the colony, no transfer
of attributes from the one to the other.

Though the conventionally imitative, the figurative, and the symbolic, are three distinct kinds
of representation, they are constantly combined in one composition, as we shall see in the
following examples, cited from the art of successive races in chronological order.

In Egyptian art the general representation of water is the conventionally imitative. In the
British Museum are two frescoes from tombs at Thebes, Nos. 177 and 170: the subject of the
first of these is an oblong pond, ground-plan and elevation being strangely confused in the
design. In this pond water is represented by parallel zigzag lines, in which fish are swimming
about. On the surface are birds and lotos flowers; the herbage at the edge of the pond is represented
by a border of symmetrical fan-shaped flowers; the field beyond by rows of trees, arranged
round the sides of the pond at right angles to each other, and in defiance of all laws of perspective.

In the fresco, No. 170, we have the representation of a river with papyrus on its bank. Here
the water is rendered by zigzag lines arranged vertically and in parallel lines, so as to resemble
herring-bone masonry, thus. There are fish in this fresco as in the preceding, and in both
each fish is drawn very distinctly, not as it would appear to the eye viewed through water.
The mode of representing this element in Egyptian painting is further abbreviated in their
hieroglyphic writing, where the sign of water is a zigzag line; this line is, so to speak,
a picture of water written in short hand. In the Egyptian Pantheon there was but one aquatic
deity, the god of the Nile; his type is, therefore, the only figurative representation of water
in Egyptian art. (Birch, "Gallery of British Museum Antiquities," Pl. 13.) In Assyrian sculpture
we have very curious conventionally imitative representations of water. On several of the friezes
from Nimroud and Khorsabad, men are seen crossing a river in boats, or in skins, accompanied
by horses swimming (see Layard, ii. p. 381). In these scenes water is represented by masses
of wavy lines somewhat resembling tresses of hair, and terminating in curls or volutes; these
wavy lines express the general character of a deep and rapid current, like that of the Tigris.
Fish are but sparingly introduced, the idea of surface being sufficiently expressed by the
floating figures and boats. In the representation of these there is the same want of perspective
as in the Egyptian fresco which we have just cited.

In the Assyrian Pantheon one aquatic deity has been discovered, the god Dagon, whose human
form terminates in a fish's tail. Of the character and attributes of this deity we know but little.

The more abbreviated mode of representing water, the zigzag line, occurs on the large silver
coins with the type of a city or a war galley (see Layard, ii. p. 386). These coins were probably
struck in Assyria, not long after the conquest of it by the Persians.

In Greek art the modes of representing water are far more varied. Two conventional imitations,
the wave moulding and the Mæander, are well known. Both are probably of the most remote antiquity;
both have been largely employed as an architectural ornament, and subordinately as a decoration
of vases, costume, furniture and implements. In the wave moulding we have a conventional representation
of the small crisping waves which break upon the shore of the Mediterranean, the sea of the Greeks.

Their regular succession, and equality of force and volume, are generalised in this moulding,
while the minuter varieties which distinguish one wave from another are merged in the general
type. The character of ocean waves is to be "for ever changing, yet the same for ever;" it
is this eternity of recurrence which the early artist has expressed in this hieroglyphic.

With this profile representation of water may be compared the sculptured waves out of which
the head and arms of Hyperion are rising in the pediment of the Parthenon (Elgin Room, No.
(65) 91, Museum Marbles, vi. pl. 1). Phidias has represented these waves like a mass of overlapping
tiles, thus generalising their rippling movement. In the Mæander pattern the graceful curves
of nature are represented by angles, as in the Egyptian hieroglyphic of water: so again the
earliest representation of the labyrinth on the coins of the Cnossus is rectangular; on later
coins we find the curvilinear form introduced.

In the language of Greek mythography, the wave pattern and the Mæander are sometimes used singly
for the idea of water, but more frequently combined with figurative representation. The number
of aquatic deities in the Greek Pantheon led to the invention of a great variety of beautiful
types. Some of these are very well known. Everybody is familiar with the general form of Poseidon
(Neptune), the Nereids, the Nymphs and River Gods; but the modes in which these types were
combined with conventional imitation and with accessory symbols deserve careful study, if we
would appreciate the surpassing richness and beauty of the language of art formed out of these
elements.

This class of representations may be divided into two principal groups, those relating to the
sea, and those relating to fresh water.

The power of the ocean and the great features of marine scenery are embodied in such types
as Poseidon, Nereus and the Nereids, that is to say, in human forms moving through the liquid
element in chariots, or on the back of dolphins, or who combine the human form with that of
the fish-like Tritons. The sea-monsters who draw these chariots are called Hippocamps, being
composed of the tail of a fish and the fore-part of a horse, the legs terminating in web-feet:
this union seems to express speed and power under perfect control, such as would characterise
the movements of sea deities. A few examples have been here selected to show how these types
were combined with symbols and conventional imitation.

In the British Museum is a vase, No. 1257, engraved (Lenormant et De Witte, Mon. Céram., i.
pl. 27), of which the subject is, Europa crossing the sea on the back of the bull. In this
design the sea is represented by a variety of expedients. First, the swimming action of the
bull suggests the idea of the liquid medium through which he moves. Behind him stands Nereus,
his staff held perpendicularly in his hand; the top of his staff comes nearly to the level
of the bull's back, and is probably meant as the measure of the whole depth of the sea. Towards
the surface line thus indicated a dolphin is rising; in the middle depth is another dolphin;
below a shrimp and a cuttle-fish, and the bottom is indicated by a jagged line of rocks, on
which are two echini.

On a mosaic found at Oudnah in Algeria (Revue Archéol., iii. pl. 50), we have a representation
of the sea, remarkable for the fulness of details with which it is made out.

This, though of the Roman period, is so thoroughly Greek in feeling, that it may be cited as
an example of the class of mythography now under consideration. The mosaic lines the floor
and sides of a bath, and, as was commonly the case in the baths of the ancients, serves as
a figurative representation of the water it contained.

On the sides are hippocamps, figures riding on dolphins, and islands on which fishermen stand;
on the floor are fish, crabs, and shrimps.

These, as in the vase with Europa, indicate the bottom of the sea: the same symbols of the
submarine world appear on many other ancient designs. Thus in vase pictures, when Poseidon
upheaves the island of Cos to overwhelm the Giant Polydotes, the island is represented as an
immense mass of rock; the parts which have been under water are indicated by a dolphin, a shrimp,
and a sepia, the parts above the water by a goat and a serpent (Lenormant et De Witte, i., tav. 5).

Sometimes these symbols occur singly in Greek art, as the types, for instance, of coins. In
such cases they cannot be interpreted without being viewed in relation to the whole context
of mythography to which they belong. If we find, for example, on one coin of Tarentum a shell,
on another a dolphin, on a third a figure of Tarus, the mythic founder of the town, riding
on a dolphin in the midst of the waves, and this latter group expresses the idea of the town
itself and its position on the coast, then we know the two former types to be but portions
of the greater design, having been detached from it, as we may detach words from sentences.

The study of the fuller and clearer examples, such as we have cited above, enables us to explain
many more compendious forms of expression. We have, for instance, on coins several representations
of ancient harbors.

Of these, the earliest occurs on the coins of Zancle, the modern Messina in Sicily. The ancients
likened the form of this harbor to a sickle, and on the coins of the town we find a curved
object, within the area of which is a dolphin. On this curve are four square elevations placed
at equal distances. It has been conjectured that these projections are either towers or the
large stones to which galleys were moored still to be seen in ancient harbors (see Burgon,
Numismatic Chronicle, iii. p. 40). With this archaic representation of a harbor may be compared
some examples of the Roman period. On a coin of Sept. Severus struck at Corinth (Millingen,
Sylloge of Uned. Coins, 1837, p. 57, Pl. II., No. 30) we have a female figure standing on a
rock between two recumbent male figures holding rudders. From an arch at the foot of the rock
a stream is flowing: this is a representation of the rock of the Acropolis of Corinth: the
female figure is a statue of Aphrodite, whose temple surmounted the rock. The stream is the
fountain Pirene. The two recumbent figures are impersonations of the two harbors, Lechreum
and Cenchreia, between which Corinth was situated. Philostratus (Icon. ii., c. 16) describes
a similar picture of the Isthmus between the two harbors, one of which was in the form of a
youth, the other of a nymph.

On another coin of Corinth we have one of the harbors in a semicircular form, the whole arc
being marked with small equal divisions, to denote the archways under which the ancient galleys
were drawn, subductæ; at the either horn or extremity of the harbor is a temple; in the centre
of the mouth, a statue of Neptune. (Millingen, Médailles Inéd., Pl. II., No. 19. Compare also
Millingen, Ancient Coins of Cities and Kings, 1831, pp. 50-61, Pl. IV., No. 15; Mionnet, Suppl.
vii. p. 79, No. 246; and the harbor of Ostium, on the large brass coins of Nero, in which there
is a representation of the Roman fleet and a reclining figure of Neptune.)

In vase pictures we have occasionally an attempt to represent water naturally. On a vase in
the British Museum (No. 785), of which the subject is Ulysses and the Sirens, the Sea is rendered
by wavy lines drawn in black on a red ground, and something like the effect of light playing
on the surface of the water is given. On each side of the ship are shapeless masses of rock
on which the Sirens stand.

One of the most beautiful of the figurative representations of the sea is the well-known type
of Scylla. She has a beautiful body, terminating in two barking dogs and two serpent tails.
Sometimes drowning men, the rari nantes in gurgite vasto, appear caught up in the coils of
these tails. Below are dolphins. Scylla generally brandishes a rudder to show the manner in
which she twists the course of ships. For varieties of her type see Monum. dell'Inst. Archeol.
Rom., iii. Tavv. 52-3.

The representations of fresh water may be arranged under the following heads--rivers, lakes,
fountains.

There are several figurative modes of representing rivers very frequently employed in ancient
mythography.

In the type which occurs earliest we have the human form combined with that of the bull in
several ways. On an archaic coin of Metapontum in Lucania, (see frontispiece to Millingen,
Ancient Coins of Greek Cities and Kings,) the river Achelous is represented with the figure
of a man with a shaggy beard and bull's horns and ears. On a vase of the best period of Greek
art (Brit. Mus. No. 789; Birch, Trans. Roy. Soc. of Lit., New Series, Lond. 1843, i. p. 100)
the same river is represented with a satyr's head and long bull's horns on the forehead; his
form, human to the waist, terminates in a fish's tail; his hair falls down his back; his beard
is long and shaggy. In this type we see a combination of the three forms separately enumerated
by Sophocles, in the commencement of the Trachiniæ.

                  [Greek: Achelôon legô,
  os m' en trisin morphaisin exêtei patros,
  phoitôn enargês auros allot' aiolos,
  drakôn heliktos, allot' andreiô kytei
  bouprôros, ek de daskiou geneiados
  krounoi dierrhainonto krênaiou potou].

In a third variety of this type the human-headed body is united at the waist with the shoulders
of a bull's body, in which it terminates. This occurs on an early vase. (Brit. Mus., No. 452.)
On the coins of Oeniadæ in Acarnia, and on those of Ambracia, all of the period after Alexander
the Great, the Achelous has a bull's body, and head with a human face. In this variety of the
type the human element is almost absorbed, as in the first variety cited above, the coin of
Metapontum, the bull portion of the type is only indicated by the addition of the horns and
ears to the human head. On the analogy between these, varieties in the type of the Achelous
and those under which the metamorphoses of the marine goddess Thetis are represented, see Gerhard,
Auserl. Vasenb. ii. pp. 106-113. It is probable that, in the type of Thetis, of Proteus, and
also of the Achelous, the singular combinations and transformations are intended to express
the changeful nature of the element water.

Numerous other examples may be cited, where rivers are represented by this combination of the
bull and human form, which maybe called, for convenience, the Androtauric type. On the coins
of Sicily, of the archaic and also of the finest period of art, rivers are most usually represented
by a youthful male figure, with small budding horns; the hair has the lank and matted form
which characterises aquatic deities in Greek mythography. The name of the river is often inscribed
round the head. When the whole figure occurs on the coin, it is always represented standing,
never reclining.

The type of the bull on the coins of Sybaris and Thurium, in Magna Græcia, has been considered,
with great probability, a representation of this kind. On the coins of Sybaris, which are of
a very early period, the head of the bull is turned round; on those of Thurium, he stoops his
head, butting: the first of these actions has been thought to symbolise the winding course
of the river, the second, its headlong current. On the coins of Thurium, the idea of water
is further suggested by the adjunct of dolphins and other fish in the exergue of the coin.
The ground on which the bull stands is indicated by herbage or pebbles. This probably represents
the river bank. Two bulls' head occur on the coins of Sardis, and it has been ingeniously conjectured
by Mr. Burgon that the two rivers of the place are expressed under this type.

The representation of river-gods as human figures in a reclining position, though probably
not so much employed in earlier Greek art as the Androtauric type, is very much more familiar
to us, from its subsequent adoption in Roman mythography. The earliest example we have of a
reclining river-god is in the figure in the Elgin Room commonly called the Ilissus, but more
probably the Cephissus. This occupied one angle in the western pediment of the Parthenon; the
other Athenian river, the Ilissus, and the fountain Callirrhoe being represented by a male
and female figure in the opposite angle; this group, now destroyed, is visible in the drawing
made by Carrey in 1678.

It is probable that the necessities of pedimental composition first led the artist to place
the river-god in a reclining position. The head of the Ilissus being broken off, we are not
sure whether he had bull's horns, like the Sicilian figures already described. His form is
youthful, in the folds of the drapery behind him there is a flow like that of waves, but the
idea of water is not suggested by any other symbol. When we compare this figure with that of
the Nile (Visconti, Mus. Pio Clem., i., Pl. 38), and the figure of the Tiber in the Louvre,
both of which are of the Roman period, we see how in these later types the artist multiplied
symbols and accessories, ingrafting them on the original simple type of the river-god, as it
was conceived by Phidias in the figure of the Ilissus. The Nile is represented as a colossal
bearded figure reclining. At his side is a cornucopia, full of the vegetable produce of the
Egyptian soil. Round his body are sixteen naked boys, who represent the sixteen cubits, the
height to which the river rose in a favorable year. The statue is placed on a basement divided
into three compartments, one above another. In the uppermost of these, waves are flowing over
in one great sheet from the side of the river-god. In the other two compartments are the animals
and plants of the river; the bas-reliefs on this basement are, in fact, a kind of abbreviated
symbolic panorama of the Nile.

The Tiber is represented in a very similar manner. On the base are, in two compartments, scenes
taken from the early Roman myths; flocks, herds, and other objects on the banks of the river.
(Visconti, Mus. P. Cl. i., Pl. 39; Millin, Galerie Mythol., i. p. 77, Pl. 74, Nos. 304, 308.)

In the types of the Greek coins of Camarina, we find two interesting representations of Lakes.
On the obverse of one of these we have, within a circle of the wave pattern, a male head, full
face, with dishevelled hair, and with a dolphin on either side; on the reverse a female figure
sailing on a swan, below which a wave moulding, and above, a dolphin.

On another coin the swan type of the reverse is associated with the youthful head of a river-god,
inscribed "Hipparis" on the obverse. On some smaller coins we have the swan flying over the
rippling waves, which are represented by the wave moulding. When we examine the chart of Sicily,
made by the Admiralty survey, we find marked down at Camarina, a lake through which the river
Hipparis flows.

We can hardly doubt that the inhabitants of Camarina represented both their river and their
lakes on their coins. The swan flying over the waves would represent a lake; the figure associated
with it being no doubt the Aphrodite worshipped at that place: the head, in a circle of wave
pattern, may express that part of the river which flows through the lake.

Fountains are usually represented by a stream of water issuing from a lion's head in the rock:
see a vase (Gerhard, Auserl. Vasenb., taf. CXXXIV.), where Hercules stands, receiving a shower-bath
from a hot spring at Thermæ in Sicily. On the coins of Syracuse the fountain Arethusa is represented
by a female head seen to the front; the flowing lines of her dishevelled hair suggest, though
they do not directly imitate, the bubbling action of the fresh-water spring; the sea in which
it rises is symbolized by the dolphins round the head. This type presents a striking analogy
with that of the Camarina head in the circle of wave pattern described above.

These are the principal modes of representing water in Greek mythography. In the art of the
Roman period, the same kind of figurative and symbolic language is employed, but there is a
constant tendency to multiply accessories and details, as we have shown in the later representations
of harbors and river-gods cited above. In these crowded compositions the eye is fatigued and
distracted by the quantity it has to examine; the language of art becomes more copious but
less terse and emphatic, and addresses itself to minds far less intelligent than the refined
critics who were the contemporaries of Phidias.

Rivers in Roman art are usually represented by reclining male figures, generally bearded, holding
reeds or other plants in their hands, and leaning on urns from which water is flowing. On the
coins of many Syrian cities, struck in imperial times, the city is represented by a turreted
female figure seated on rocks, and resting her feet on the shoulder of a youthful male figure,
who looks up in her face, stretching out his arms, and who is sunk in the ground as high as
the waist. See Müller (Denkmäler d. A. Kunst, i., taf. 49, No. 220) for a group of this kind
in the Vatican, and several similar designs on coins.

On the column of Trajan there occur many rude representations of the Danube, and other rivers
crossed by the Romans in their military expeditions. The water is imitated by sculptured wavy
lines, in which boats are placed. In one scene (Bartoli, Colonna Trajana, Tav. 4) this rude
conventional imitation is combined with a figure. In a recess in the river bank is a reclining
river-god, terminating at the waist. This is either meant for a statue which was really placed
on the bank of the river, and which therefore marks some particular locality, or we have here
figurative representation blended with conventional imitation.

On the column of Antoninus (Bartoli, Colon. Anton., Tav. 15) a storm of rain is represented
by the head of Jupiter Pluvius, who has a vast outspread beard flowing in long tresses. In
the Townley collection, in the British Museum, is a Roman helmet found at Ribchester in Lancashire,
with a mask or vizor attached. The helmet is richly embossed with figures in a battle scene;
round the brow is a row of turrets; the hair in the forehead is so treated as to give the idea
of waves washing the base of the turrets. This head is perhaps a figurative representation
of a town girt with fortifications and a moat, near which some great battle was fought. It
is engraved (Vetusta Monum. of Soc. Ant. London, iv., Pl. 1-4).

In the Galeria at Florence is a group in alto relievo (Gori, Inscript. Ant. Flor. 1727, p.
76, Tab. 14) of three female figures, one of whom is certainly Demeter Kourotrophos, or the
earth; another, Thetis, or the sea; the centre of the three seems to represent Aphrodite associated,
as on the coins of Camarina, with the element of fresh water.

This figure is seated on a swan, and holds over her head an arched veil. Her hair is bound
with reeds; above her veil grows a tall water plant, and below the swan other water plants,
and a stork seated on a hydria, or pitcher, from which water is flowing. The swan, the stork,
the water plants, and the hydria must all be regarded as symbols of fresh water, the latter
emblem being introduced to show that the element is fit for the use of man.

Fountains in Roman art are generally personified as figures of nymphs reclining with urns,
or standing holding before them a large shell.

One of the latest representations of water in ancient art is the mosaic of Palestrina (Barthélemy,
in Bartoli, Peint. Antiques) which may be described as a kind of rude panorama of some district
of Upper Egypt, a bird's-eye view, half man, half picture, in which the details are neither
adjusted to a scale, nor drawn according to perspective, but crowded together, as they would
be in an ancient bas-relief.

  22. ARABIAN ORNAMENTATION.

I do not mean what I have here said of the Inventive power of the Arab to be understood as
in the least applying to the detestable ornamentation of the Alhambra.[105] The Alhambra is
no more characteristic of Arab work, than Milan Cathedral is of Gothic: it is a late building,
a work of the Spanish dynasty in its last decline, and its ornamentation is fit for nothing
but to be transferred to patterns of carpets or bindings of books, together with their marbling,
and mottling, and other mechanical recommendations. The Alhambra ornament has of late been
largely used in shop-fronts, to the no small detriment of Regent Street and Oxford Street.

  23. VARIETIES OF CHAMFER.

Let B A C, Fig. LXXII., be the original angle of the wall. Inscribe within it a circle, p Q
N p, of the size of the bead required, touching A B, A C, in p, p; join p, p, and draw B C
parallel to it, touching the circle.

Then the lines B C, p p are the limits of the possible chamfers constructed with curves struck
either from centre A, as the line Q q, N d, r u, g c, &c., or from any other point chosen as
a centre in the direction Q A produced: and also of all chamfers in straight lines, as a b,
e f. There are, of course, an infinite number of chamfers to be struck between B C and p p,
from every point in Q A produced to infinity; thus we have infinity multiplied into infinity
to express the number of possible chamfers of this species, which are peculiarly Italian chamfers;
together with another singly infinite group of the straight chamfers, a b, e f, &c., of which
the one formed by the line a b, passing through the centre of the circle, is the universal
early Gothic chamfer of Venice.

Again. Either on the line A C, or on any other lines A l or A m, radiating from A, any number
of centres may be taken, from which, with any radii not greater than the distance between such
points and Q, an infinite number of curves may be struck, such as t u, r s, N n (all which
are here struck from centres on the line A C). These lines represent the great class of the
northern chamfers, of which the number is infinity raised to its fourth power, but of which
the curve N n (for northern) represents the average condition; the shallower chamfers of the
same group, r s, t u, &c., occurring often in Italy. The lines r u, t u, and a b may be taken
approximating to the most frequent conditions of the southern chamfer.

It is evident that the chords of any of these curves will give a relative group of rectilinear
chamfers, occurring both in the North and South; but the rectilinear chamfers, I think, invariably
fall within the line Q C, and are either parallel with it, or inclined to A C at an angle greater
than A C Q, and often perpendicular to it; but never inclined to it at an angle less than A C Q.

  24. RENAISSANCE BASES.

The following extract from my note-book refers also to some features of late decoration of shafts.

"The Scuola di San Rocco is one of the most interesting examples of Renaissance work in Venice.
Its fluted pillars are surrounded each by a wreath, one of vine, another of laurel, another
of oak, not indeed arranged with the fantasticism of early Gothic; but, especially the laurel,
reminding one strongly of the laurel sprays, powerful as well as beautiful, of Veronese and
Tintoret. Their stems are curiously and richly interlaced--the last vestige of the Byzantine
wreathed work--and the vine-leaves are ribbed on the surfaces, I think, nearly as finely as
those of the Noah,[106] though more injured by time. The capitals are far the richest Renaissance
in Venice, less corrupt and more masculine in plan, than any other, and truly suggestive of
support, though of course showing the tendency to error in this respect; and finally, at the
angles of the pure Attic bases, on the square plinth, are set couchant animals; one, an elephant
four inches high, very curiously and cleverly cut, and all these details worked with a spirit,
finish, fancy, and affection quite worthy of the middle ages. But they have all the marked
fault of being utterly detached from the architecture. The wreaths round the columns look as
if they would drop off the next moment, and the animals at the bases produce exactly the effect
of mice who had got there by accident: one feels them ridiculously diminutive, and utterly
useless."

The effect of diminutiveness is, I think, chiefly owing to there being no other groups of figures
near them, to accustom the eye to the proportion, and to the needless choice of the largest
animals, elephants, bears, and lions, to occupy a position so completely insignificant, and
to be expressed on so contemptible a scale,--not in a bas-relief or pictorial piece of sculpture,
but as independent figures. The whole building is a most curious illustration of the appointed
fate of the Renaissance architects,--to caricature whatever they imitated, and misapply whatever
they learned.

  25. ROMANIST DECORATION OF BASES.

I have spoken above (Appendix 12) of the way in which the Roman Catholic priests everywhere
suffer their churches to be desecrated. But the worst instances I ever saw of sacrilege and
brutality, daily permitted in the face of all men, were the uses to which the noble base of
St. Mark's was put, when I was last in Venice. Portions of nearly all cathedrals may be found
abandoned to neglect; but this base of St. Mark's is in no obscure position. Full fronting
the western sun--crossing the whole breadth of St. Mark's Place--the termination of the most
noble square in the world--the centre of the most noble city--its purple marbles were, in the
winter of 1849, the customary gambling tables of the idle children of Venice; and the parts
which flank the Great Entrance, that very entrance where "Barbarossa flung his mantle off,"
were the counters of a common bazaar for children's toys, carts, dolls, and small pewter spoons
and dishes, German caricatures and books of the Opera, mixed with those of the offices of religion;
the caricatures being fastened with twine round the porphyry shafts of the church. One Sunday,
the 24th of February, 1850, the book-stall being somewhat more richly laid out than usual,
I noted down the titles of a few of the books in the order in which they lay, and I give them
below. The irony conveyed by the juxtaposition of the three in Italics appears too shrewd to
be accidental; but the fact was actually so.

Along the edge of the white plinth were a row of two kinds of books,

  Officium Beatæ Virg. M.; and Officium Hebdomadæ sanctæ, juxta Formam
    Missalis et Breviarii Romani sub Urbano VIII. correcti.

Behind these lay, side by side, the following:

  Don Desiderio. Dramma Giocoso per Musica.
  Breve Esposizione della Carattere di vera Religione.

On the top of this latter, keeping its leaves open,

  La Figlia del Reggimento. Melodramma comica.
  Carteggio di Madama la Marchesa di Pompadour, ossia
     raccolta di Lettere scritte della Medesima.
  Istruzioni di morale Condotta per le Figlie.
  Francesca di Rimini. Dramma per Musica.

Then, a little farther on, after a mass of plays:--

  Orazioni a Gesu Nazareno e a Maria addolorata.
  Semiramide; Melodramma tragico da rappresentarsi nel Gran Teatro
    il Fenice.
  Modo di orare per l'Acquisto del S. Giubileo, conceduto a tutto il
    Mondo Cattolico da S. S. Gregorio XVI.
  Le due illustre Rivali, Melodramma in Tre Atti, da rappresentarsi
    nel nuovo Gran Teatro il Fenice.
  Il Cristiano secondo il Cuore di Gesu, per la Pratica delle sue
    Virtu.
  Traduzione dell'Idioma Italiana.
  La chiava Chinese; Commedia del Sig. Abate Pietro Chiari.
  La Pelarina; Intermezzo de Tre Parti per Musica.
  Il Cavaliero e la Dama; Commedia in Tre Atti in Prosa.

I leave these facts without comment. But this being the last piece of Appendix I have to add
to the present volume, I would desire to close its pages with a question to my readers--a statistical
question, which, I doubt not, is being accurately determined for us all elsewhere, and which,
therefore, it seems to me, our time would not be wasted in determining for ourselves.

There has now been peace between England and the continental powers about thirty-five years,
and during that period the English have visited the continent at the rate of many thousands
a year, staying there, I suppose, on the average, each two or three months; nor these an inferior
kind of English, but the kind which ought to be the best--the noblest born, the best taught,
the richest in time and money, having more leisure, knowledge, and power than any other portion
of the nation. These, we might suppose, beholding, as they travelled, the condition of the
states in which the Papal religion is professed, and being, at the same time, the most enlightened
section of a great Protestant nation, would have been animated with some desire to dissipate
the Romanist errors, and to communicate to others the better knowledge which they possessed
themselves. I doubt not but that He who gave peace upon the earth, and gave it by the hand
of England, expected this much of her, and has watched every one of the millions of her travellers
as they crossed the sea, and kept count for him of his travelling expenses, and of their distribution,
in a manner of which neither the traveller nor his courier were at all informed. I doubt not,
I say, but that such accounts have been literally kept for all of us, and that a day will come
when they will be made clearly legible to us, and when we shall see added together, on one
side of the account book, a great sum, the certain portion, whatever it may be, of this thirty-five
years' spendings of the rich English, accounted for in this manner:--

To wooden spoons, nut-crackers, and jewellery, bought at Geneva, and elsewhere among the Alps,
so much; to shell cameos and bits of mosaic bought at Rome, so much; to coral horns and lava
brooches bought at Naples, so much; to glass beads at Venice, and gold filigree at Genoa, so
much; to pictures, and statues, and ornaments, everywhere, so much; to avant-couriers and extra
post-horses, for show and magnificence, so much; to great entertainments and good places for
seeing sights, so much; to ball-dresses and general vanities, so much. This, I say, will be
the sum on one side of the book; and on the other will be written:

To the struggling Protestant Churches of France, Switzerland, and Piedmont, so much.

Had we not better do this piece of statistics for ourselves, in time?

    printer writes at the side of the page a note, which I insert with
    thanks:--"This is not the first attempt at a French order. The
    writer has a Treatise by Sebastian Le Clerc, a great man in his
    generation, which contains a Roman order, a Spanish order, which the
    inventor appears to think very grand, and a new French order
    nationalised by the Gallic cock crowing and clapping its wings in
    the capital."

  [97] One of the upper stories is also in Gally Knight's plate
    represented as merely banded, and otherwise plain: it is, in
    reality, covered with as delicate inlaying as the rest. The whole
    front is besides out of proportion, and out of perspective, at once;
    and yet this work is referred to as of authority, by our architects.
    Well may our architecture fall from its place among the fine arts,
    as it is doing rapidly; nearly all our works of value being devoted
    to the Greek architecture, which is utterly useless to us--or
    worse. One most noble book, however, has been dedicated to our
    English abbeys,--Mr. E. Sharpe's "Architectural Parallels"--almost a
    model of what I should like to see done for the Gothic of all
    Europe.

  [98] Except in the single passage "tell it unto the Church," which
    is simply the extension of what had been commanded before, i.e.,
    tell the fault first "between thee and him," then taking "with thee
    one or two more," then, to all Christian men capable of hearing the
    cause: if he refuse to hear their common voice, "let him be unto
    thee as a heathen man and publican:" (But consider how Christ
    treated both.)

  [99] One or two remarks on this subject, some of which I had
    intended to have inserted here, and others in Appendix 5, I have
    arranged in more consistent order, and published in a separate
    pamphlet, "Notes on the Construction of Sheep-folds," for the
    convenience of readers interested in other architecture than that of
    Venetian palaces.

  [100] Not, however, by Johnson's testimony: Vide Adventurer, No.
    39.

  [101] We have done so--theoretically; just as one would reason on
    the human form from the bones outwards: but the Architect of human
    form frames all at once--bone and flesh.

  [102] Of course mere multiplicability, as of an engraving, does not
    diminish the intrinsic value of the work; and if the casts of
    sculpture could be as sharp as the sculpture itself, they would hold
    to it the relation of value which engravings hold to paintings. And,
    if we choose to have our churches all alike, we might cast them all
    in bronze--we might actually coin churches, and have mints of
    Cathedrals. It would be worthy of the spirit of the century to put
    milled edges for mouldings, and have a popular currency of religious
    subjects: a new cast of nativities every Christmas. I have not heard
    this contemplated, however, and I speak, therefore, only of the
    results which I believe are contemplated, as attainable by mere
    mechanical applications of glass and iron.

  [103] I shall often have occasion to write measures in the current
    text, therefore the reader will kindly understand that whenever they
    are thus written, 2 ,, 2, with double commas between, the first
    figures stand for English feet, the second for English inches.

  [104] I cannot suffer this volume to close without also thanking my
    kind friend, Mr. Rawdon Brown, for help given me in a thousand ways
    during my stay in Venice: but chiefly for his direction to passages
    elucidatory of my subject in the MSS. of St. Mark's library.

  [105] I have not seen the building itself, but Mr. Owen Jones's work
    may, I suppose, be considered as sufficiently representing it for
    all purposes of criticism.

  [106] The sculpture of the Drunkenness of Noah on the Ducal Palace,
    of which we shall have much to say hereafter.
