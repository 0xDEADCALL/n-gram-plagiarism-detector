SEA-POWER AND OTHER STUDIES

BY ADMIRAL SIR CYPRIAN BRIDGE, G.C.B.

PREFACE

The essays collected in this volume are republished in the hope that they may be of some use
to those who are interested in naval history. The aim has been to direct attention to certain
historical occurrences and conditions which the author ventures to think have been often misunderstood.
An endeavour has been made to show the continuity of the operation of sea-power throughout
history, and the importance of recognising this at the present day.

In some cases specially relating to our navy at different periods a revision of the more commonly
accepted conclusions--formed, it is believed, on imperfect knowledge--is asked for.

It is also hoped that the intimate connection between naval history in the strict sense and
military history in the strict sense has been made apparent, and likewise the fact that both
are in reality branches of the general history of a nation and not something altogether distinct
from and outside it.

In a collection of essays on kindred subjects some repetitions are inevitable, but it is believed
that they will be found present only to a moderate extent in the following pages.

My nephew, Mr. J. S. C. Bridge, has very kindly seen the book through the press.

June 1910.

SEA-POWER[1]

[Footnote 1: Written in 1899. (EncyclopoediaBritannica.)]

Sea-power is a term used to indicate two distinct, though cognate things. The affinity of these
two and the indiscriminate manner in which the term has been applied to each have tended to
obscure its real significance. The obscurity has been deepened by the frequency with which
the term has been confounded with the old phrase, 'Sovereignty of the sea,' and the still current
expression, 'Command of the sea.' A discussion--etymological, or even archæological in character--of
the term must be undertaken as an introduction to the explanation of its now generally accepted
meaning. It is one of those compound words in which a Teutonic and a Latin (or Romance) element
are combined, and which are easily formed and become widely current when the sea is concerned.
Of such are 'sea-coast,' 'sea-forces' (the 'land- and sea-forces' used to be a common designation
of what we now call the 'Army and Navy'), 'sea-service,' 'sea-serpent,' and 'sea-officer' (now
superseded by 'naval officer'). The term in one form is as old as the fifteenth century. Edward
III, in commemoration of the naval victory of Sluys, coined gold 'nobles' which bore on one
side his effigy 'crowned, standing in a large ship, holding in one hand a sword and in the
other a shield.' An anonymous poet, who wrote in the reign of Henry VI, says of this coin:

  For four things our noble showeth to me,
  King, ship, and sword, and powerofthesea.

Even in its present form the term is not of very recent date. Grote [2] speaks of 'the conversion
of Athens from a land-power into a sea-power.' In a lecture published in 1883, but probably
delivered earlier, the late Sir J. R. Seeley says that 'commerce was swept out of the Mediterranean
by the besom of the Turkish sea-power.'[3] The term also occurs in vol. xviii. of the 'Encyclopædia
Britannica,' published in 1885. At p. 574 of that volume (art. Persia) we are told that Themistocles
was 'the founder of the Attic sea-power.' The sense in which the term is used differs in these
extracts. In the first it means what we generally call a 'naval power'--that is to say, a state
having a considerable navy in contradistinction to a 'military power,' a state with a considerable
army but only a relatively small navy. In the last two extracts it means all the elements of
the naval strength of the state referred to; and this is the meaning that is now generally,
and is likely to be exclusively, attached to the term owing to the brilliant way in which it
has been elucidated by Captain A. T. Mahan of the United States Navy in a series of remarkable
works.[4] The double use of the term is common in German, though in that language both parts
of the compound now in use are Teutonic. One instance out of many may be cited from the historian
Adolf Holm.[5] He says[6] that Athens, being in possession of a good naval port, could become
'einebedeutende Seemacht,' i.e. an important naval power. He also says[7] that Gelon of Syracuse,
besides a large army (Heer), had 'eine bedeutendeSeemacht,' meaning a considerable navy. The
term, in the first of the two senses, is old in German, as appears from the following, extracted
from Zedler's 'Grosses Universal Lexicon,' vol. xxxvi:[8] 'Seemachten, Seepotenzen, Latin.
summae potestatesmaripotentes.' 'Seepotenzen' is probably quite obsolete now. It is interesting
as showing that German no more abhors Teuto-Latin or Teuto-Romance compounds than English.
We may note, as a proof of the indeterminate meaning of the expression until his own epoch-making
works had appeared, that Mahan himself in his earliest book used it in both senses. He says,[9]
'The Spanish Netherlands ceased to be a sea-power.' He alludes[10] to the development of a
nation as a 'sea-power,' and[11] to the inferiority of the Confederate States 'as a sea-power.'
Also,[12] he remarks of the war of the Spanish Succession that 'before it England was one of
the sea-powers, after it she was the sea-power without any second.' In all these passages,
as appears from the use of the indefinite article, what is meant is a naval power, or a state
in possession of a strong navy. The other meaning of the term forms the general subject of
his writings above enumerated. In his earlier works Mahan writes 'sea power' as two words;
but in a published letter of the 19th February 1897, he joins them with a hyphen, and defends
this formation of the term and the sense in which he uses it. We may regard him as the virtual
inventor of the term in its more diffused meaning, for--even if it had been employed by earlier
writers in that sense--it is he beyond all question who has given it general currency. He has
made it impossible for anyone to treat of sea-power without frequent reference to his writings
and conclusions.

There is something more than mere literary interest in the fact that the term in another language
was used more than two thousand years ago. Before Mahan no historian--not even one of those
who specially devoted themselves to the narration of naval occurrences--had evinced a more
correct appreciation of the general principles of naval warfare than Thucydides. He alludes
several times to the importance of getting command of the sea. This country would have been
saved some disasters and been less often in peril had British writers--taken as guides by the
public--possessed the same grasp of the true principles of defence as Thucydides exhibited.
One passage in his history is worth quoting. Brief as it is, it shows that on the subject of
sea-power he was a predecessor of Mahan. In a speech in favour of prosecuting the war, which
he puts into the mouth of Pericles, these words occur:-- oimeu garouchexousiuallaeuautilabeiuamacheiaemiudeesti
gaepollaekaieuuaesoiskaikataepeiroumegagar totesthalassaeskratos. The last part of this extract,
though often translated 'command of the sea,' or 'dominion of the sea,' really has the wider
meaning of sea-power, the 'power of the sea' of the old English poet above quoted. This wider
meaning should be attached to certain passages in Herodotus,[13] which have been generally
interpreted 'commanding the sea,' or by the mere titular and honorific 'having the dominion
of the sea.' One editor of Herodotus, Ch. F. Baehr, did, however, see exactly what was meant,
for, with reference to the allusion to Polycrates, he says, classemaximumvaluit. This is perhaps
as exact a definition of sea-power as could be given in a sentence.

[Footnote 13: Herodotus, iii. 122 in two places; v.83.]

It is, however, impossible to give a definition which would be at the same time succinct and
satisfactory. To say that 'sea-power' means the sum-total of the various elements that go to
make up the naval strength of a state would be in reality to beg the question. Mahan lays down
the 'principal conditions affecting the sea-power of nations,' but he does not attempt to give
a concise definition of it. Yet no one who has studied his works will find it difficult to
understand what it indicates.

Our present task is to put readers in possession of the means of doing this. The best, indeed--as
Mahan has made us see--the only effective way of attaining this object is to treat the matter
historically. Whatever date we may agree to assign to the formation of the term itself, the
idea--as we have seen--is as old as history. It is not intended to give a condensed history
of sea-power, but rather an analysis of the idea and what it contains, illustrating this analysis
with examples from history ancient and modern. It is important to know that it is not something
which originated in the middle of the seventeenth century, and having seriously affected history
in the eighteenth, ceased to have weight till Captain Mahan appeared to comment on it in the
last decade of the nineteenth. With a few masterly touches Mahan, in his brief allusion to
the second Punic war, has illustrated its importance in the struggle between Rome and Carthage.
What has to be shown is that the principles which he has laid down in that case, and in cases
much more modern, are true and have been true always and everywhere. Until this is perceived
there is much history which cannot be understood, and yet it is essential to our welfare as
a maritime people that we should understand it thoroughly. Our failure to understand it has
more than once brought us, if not to the verge of destruction, at any rate within a short distance
of serious disaster.

SEA-POWER IN ANCIENT TIMES

The high antiquity of decisive naval campaigns is amongst the most interesting features of
international conflicts. Notwithstanding the much greater frequency of land wars, the course
of history has been profoundly changed more often by contests on the water. That this has not
received the notice it deserved is true, and Mahan tells us why. As in modern times the fate
of India and the fate of North America were determined by sea-power, so also at a very remote
epoch sea-power decided whether or not Hellenic colonisation was to take root in, and Hellenic
culture to dominate, Central and Northern Italy as it dominated Southern Italy, where traces
of it are extant to this day. A moment's consideration will enable us to see how different
the history of the world would have been had a Hellenised city grown and prospered on the Seven
Hills. Before the Tarquins were driven out of Rome a Phocoean fleet was encountered (537 B.C.)
off Corsica by a combined force of Etruscans and Phoenicians, and was so handled that the Phocoeans
abandoned the island and settled on the coast of Lucania.[14] The enterprise of their navigators
had built up for the Phoenician cities and their great off-shoot Carthage, a sea-power which
enabled them to gain the practical sovereignty of the sea to the west of Sardinia and Sicily.
The control of these waters was the object of prolonged and memorable struggles, for on it--as
the result showed--depended the empire of the world. From very remote times the consolidation
and expansion, from within outwards, of great continental states have had serious consequences
for mankind when they were accompanied by the acquisition of a coast-line and the absorption
of a maritime population. We shall find that the process loses none of its importance in recent
years. 'The ancient empires,' says the historian of Greece, Ernst Curtius, 'as long as no foreign
elements had intruded into them, had an invincible horror of the water.' When the condition,
which Curtius notices in parenthesis, arose, the 'horror' disappeared. There is something highly
significant in the uniformity of the efforts of Assyria, Egypt, Babylon, and Persia to get
possession of the maritime resources of Phoenicia. Our own immediate posterity will, perhaps,
have to reckon with the results of similar efforts in our own day. It is this which gives a
living interest to even the very ancient history of sea-power, and makes the study of it of
great practical importance to us now. We shall see, as we go on, how the phenomena connected
with it reappear with striking regularity in successive periods. Looked at in this light, the
great conflicts of former ages are full of useful, indeed necessary, instruction.

[Footnote 14: Mommsen, Hist.Rome, English trans., i. p. 153.]

In the first and greatest of the contests waged by the nations of the East against Europe--the
Persian wars--sea-power was the governing factor. Until Persia had expanded to the shores of
the Levant the European Greeks had little to fear from the ambition of the great king. The
conquest of Egypt by Cambyses had shown how formidable that ambition could be when supported
by an efficient navy. With the aid of the naval forces of the Phoenician cities the Persian
invasion of Greece was rendered comparatively easy. It was the naval contingents from Phoenicia
which crushed the Ionian revolt. The expedition of Mardonius, and still more that of Datis
and Artaphernes, had indicated the danger threatening Greece when the master of a great army
was likewise the master of a great navy. Their defeat at Marathon was not likely to, and as
a matter of fact did not, discourage the Persians from further attempts at aggression. As the
advance of Cambyses into Egypt had been flanked by a fleet, so also was that of Xerxes into
Greece. By the good fortune sometimes vouch-safed to a people which, owing to its obstinate
opposition to, or neglect of, a wise policy, scarcely deserves it, there appeared at Athens
an influential citizen who understood all that was meant by the term sea-power. Themistocles
saw more clearly than any of his contemporaries that, to enable Athens to play a leading part
in the Hellenic world, she needed above all things a strong navy. 'He had already in his eye
the battle-field of the future.' He felt sure that the Persians would come back, and come with
such forces that resistance in the open field would be out of the question. One scene of action
remained--the sea. Persuaded by him the Athenians increased their navy, so that of the 271
vessels comprising the Greek fleet at Artemisium, 147 had been provided by Athens, which also
sent a large reinforcement after the first action. Though no one has ever surpassed Themistocles
in the faculty of correctly estimating the importance of sea-power, it was understood by Xerxes
as clearly as by him that the issue of the war depended upon naval operations. The arrangements
made under the Persian monarch's direction, and his very personal movements, show that this
was his view. To have made certain of success, the Persians should have first obtained a command
of the Ægean, as complete for all practical purposes as the French and English had of the sea
generally in the war against Russia of 1854-56. The Persian sea-power was not equal to the
task. The fleet of the great king was numerically stronger than that of the Greek allies; but
it has been proved many times that naval efficiency does not depend on numerical superiority
alone. The choice sections of the Persian fleet were the contingents of the Ionians and Phoenicians.
The former were half-hearted or disaffected; whilst the latter were, at best, not superior
in skill, experience, and valour to the Greek sailors. At Salamis Greece was saved not only
from the ambition and vengeance of Xerxes, but also and for many centuries from oppression
by an Oriental conqueror. Persia did not succeed against the Greeks, not because she had no
sea-power, but because her sea-power, artificially built up, was inferior to that which was
a natural element of the vitality of her foes. Ionia was lost and Greece in the end enslaved,
because the quarrels of Greeks with Greeks led to the ruin of their naval states.

The Peloponnesian was largely a naval war. The confidence of the Athenians in their sea-power
had a great deal to do with its outbreak. The immediate occasion of the hostilities, which
in time involved so many states, was the opportunity offered by the conflict between Corinth
and Corcyra of increasing the sea-power of Athens. Hitherto the Athenian naval predominance
had been virtually confined to the Ægean Sea. The Corcyræan envoy, who pleaded for help at
Athens, dwelt upon the advantage to be derived by the Athenians from alliance with a naval
state occupying an important situation 'with respect to the western regions towards which the
views of the Athenians had for some time been directed.'[15] It was the 'weapon of her sea-power,'
to adopt Mahan's phrase, that enabled Athens to maintain the great conflict in which she was
engaged. Repeated invasions of her territory, the ravages of disease amongst her people, and
the rising disaffection of her allies had been more than made up for by her predominance on
the water. The scale of the subsequent Syracusan expedition showed how vigorous Athens still
was down to the interruption of the war by the peace of Nicias. The great expedition just mentioned
over-taxed her strength. Its failure brought about the ruin of the state. It was held by contemporaries,
and has been held in our own day, that the Athenian defeat at Syracuse was due to the omission
of the government at home to keep the force in Sicily properly supplied and reinforced. This
explanation of failure is given in all ages, and should always be suspected. The friends of
unsuccessful generals and admirals always offer it, being sure of the support of the political
opponents of the administration. After the despatch of the supporting expedition under Demosthenes
and Eurymedon, no further great reinforcement, as Nicias admitted, was possible. The weakness
of Athens was in the character of the men who swayed the popular assemblies and held high commands.
A people which remembered the administration of a Pericles, and yet allowed a Cleon or an Alcibiades
to direct its naval and military policy, courted defeat. Nicias, notwithstanding the possession
of high qualities, lacked the supreme virtue of a commander--firm resolution. He dared not
face the obloquy consequent on withdrawal from an enterprise on which the popular hopes had
been fixed; and therefore he allowed a reverse to be converted into an overwhelming disaster.
'The complete ruin of Athens had appeared, both to her enemies and to herself, impending and
irreparable. But so astonishing, so rapid, and so energetic had been her rally, that [a year
after Syracuse] she was found again carrying on a terrible struggle.'[16] Nevertheless her
sea-power had indeed been ruined at Syracuse. Now she could wage war only 'with impaired resources
and on a purely defensive system.' Even before Arginusæ it was seen that 'superiority of nautical
skill had passed to the Peloponnesians and their allies.'[17]

The great, occasionally interrupted, and prolonged contest between Rome and Carthage was a
sustained effort on the part of one to gain and of the other to keep the control of the Western
Mediterranean. So completely had that control been exercised by Carthage, that she had anticipated
the Spanish commercial policy in America. The Romans were precluded by treaties from trading
with the Carthaginian territories in Hispania, Africa, and Sardinia. Rome, as Mommsen tells
us, 'was from the first a maritime city and, in the period of its vigour, never was so foolish
or so untrue to its ancient traditions as wholly to neglect its war marine and to desire to
be a mere continental power.' It may be that it was lust of wealth rather than lust of dominion
that first prompted a trial of strength with Carthage. The vision of universal empire could
hardly as yet have formed itself in the imagination of a single Roman. The area of Phoenician
maritime commerce was vast enough both to excite jealousy and to offer vulnerable points to
the cupidity of rivals. It is probable that the modern estimate of the sea-power of Carthage
is much exaggerated. It was great by comparison, and of course overwhelmingly great when there
were none but insignificant competitors to challenge it. Mommsen holds that, in the fourth
and fifth centuries after the foundation of Rome, 'the two main competitors for the dominion
of the Western waters' were Carthage and Syracuse. 'Carthage,' he says, 'had the preponderance,
and Syracuse sank more and more into a second-rate naval power. The maritime importance of
the Etruscans was wholly gone.... Rome itself was not exempt from the same fate; its own waters
were likewise commanded by foreign fleets.' The Romans were for a long time too much occupied
at home to take much interest in Mediterranean matters. The position of the Carthaginians in
the western basin of the Mediterranean was very like that of the Portuguese long afterwards
in India. No one is surprised on finding that the land-forces of Carthage were composed largely
of alien mercenaries. We have several examples from which we can infer a parallel, if not an
identical, condition of her maritime resources. How, then, was the great Carthaginian carrying-trade
provided for? The experience of more than one country will enable us to answer this question.
The ocean trade of those off-shoots or dependencies of the United Kingdom, viz. the United
States, Australasia, and India, is largely or chiefly conducted by shipping of the old country.
So that of Carthage was largely conducted by old Phoenicians. These may have obtained a 'Carthaginian
Register,' or the contemporary equivalent; but they could not all have been purely Carthaginian
or Liby-Phoenician. This must have been the case even more with the war-navy. British India
for a considerable time possessed a real and indeed highly efficient navy; but it was officered
entirely and manned almost entirely by men from the 'old country.' Moreover, it was small.
The wealth of India would have sufficed to furnish a larger material element; but, as the country
could not supply the personnel, it would have been absurd to speak of the sea-power of India
apart from that of England. As soon as the Romans chose to make the most of their natural resources
the maritime predominance of Carthage was doomed. The artificial basis of the latter's sea-power
would not enable it to hold out against serious and persistent assaults. Unless this is perceived
it is impossible to understand the story of the Punic wars. Judged by every visible sign of
strength, Carthage, the richer, the more enterprising, ethnically the more predominant amongst
her neighbours, and apparently the more nautical, seemed sure to win in the great struggle
with Rome which, by the conditions of the case, was to be waged largely on the water. Yet those
who had watched the struggles of the Punic city with the Sicilian Greeks, and especially that
with Agathocles, must have seen reason to cherish doubts concerning her naval strength. It
was an anticipation of the case of Spain in the age of Philip II. As the great Elizabethan
seamen discerned the defects of the Spanish naval establishment, so men at Rome discerned those
of the Carthaginian. Dates in connection with this are of great significance. A comprehensive
measure, with the object of 'rescuing their marine from its condition of impotence,' was taken
by the Romans in the year 267 B.C. Four quoestores classici--in modern naval English we may
perhaps call them port-admirals--were nominated, and one was stationed at each of four ports.
The objects of the Roman Senate, so Mommsen tells us, were very obvious. It was, and had to
be, largely a naval contest. The Romans waged it with varying fortune, but in the end triumphed
by means of their sea-power. 'The sea was the place where all great destinies were decided.'[19]
The victory of Catulus over the Carthaginian fleet off the Ægatian Islands decided the war
and left to the Romans the possession of Sicily and the power of possessing themselves of Sardinia
and Corsica. It would be an interesting and perhaps not a barren investigation to inquire to
what extent the decline of the mother states of Phoenicia, consequent on the campaigns of Alexander
the Great, had helped to enfeeble the naval efficiency of the Carthaginian defences. One thing
was certain. Carthage had now met with a rival endowed with natural maritime resources greater
than her own. That rival also contained citizens who understood the true importance of sea-power.
A thorough comprehension of the events of the first Punic war enables us to solve what, until
Mahan wrote, had been one of the standing enigmas of history, viz. Hannibal's invasion of Italy
by land instead of by sea in the second Punic war. Mahan's masterly examination of this question
has set at rest all doubts as to the reason of Hannibal's action.[21] The naval predominance
in the western basin of the Mediterranean acquired by Rome had never been lost. Though modern
historians, even those belonging to a maritime country, may have failed to perceive it, the
Carthaginians knew well enough that the Romans were too strong for them on the sea. Though
other forces co-operated to bring about the defeat of Carthage in the second Punic war, the
Roman navy, as Mahan demonstrates, was the most important. Westminster, 1899.]

[Footnote 21: Inf.onHist., pp. 13-21.]

The attainment of all but universal dominion by Rome was now only a question of time. 'The
annihilation of the Carthaginian fleet had made the Romans masters of the sea.'[22] A lodgment
had already been gained in Illyricum, and countries farther east were before long to be reduced
to submission. A glance at the map will show that to effect this the command of the eastern
basin of the Mediterranean, like that of the western, must be secured by the Romans. The old
historic navies of the Greek and Phoenician states had declined. One considerable naval force
there was which, though it could not have prevented, was strong enough to have delayed the
Roman progress eastwards. This force belonged to Rhodes, which in the years immediately following
the close of the second Punic war reached its highest point as a naval power.[23] Far from
trying to obstruct the advance of the Romans the Rhodian fleet helped it. Hannibal, in his
exile, saw the necessity of being strong on the sea if the East was to be saved from the grasp
of his hereditary foe; but the resources of Antiochus, even with the mighty cooperation of
Hannibal, were insufficient. In a later and more often-quoted struggle between East and West--that
which was decided at Actium--sea-power was again seen to 'have the casting vote.' When the
whole of the Mediterranean coasts became part of a single state the importance of the navy
was naturally diminished; but in the struggles within the declining empire it rose again at
times. The contest of the Vandal Genseric with Majorian and the African expedition of Belisarius--not
to mention others--were largely influenced by the naval operations.[24]

SEA-POWER IN THE MIDDLE AGES

A decisive event, the Mohammedan conquest of Northern Africa from Egypt westwards, is unintelligible
until it is seen how great a part sea-power played in effecting it. Purely land expeditions,
or expeditions but slightly supported from the sea, had ended in failure. The emperor at Constantinople
still had at his disposal a fleet capable of keeping open the communications with his African
province. It took the Saracens half a century (647-698 A.D.) to win 'their way along the coast
of Africa as far as the Pillars of Hercules';[25] and, as Gibbon tells us, it was not till
the Commander of the Faithful had prepared a great expedition, this time by sea as well as
by land, that the Saracenic dominion was definitely established. It has been generally assumed
that the Arabian conquerors who, within a few years of his death, spread the faith of Mohammed
over vast regions, belonged to an essentially non-maritime race; and little or no stress has
been laid on the extent to which they relied on naval support in prosecuting their conquests.
In parts of Arabia, however, maritime enterprise was far from non-existent; and when the Mohammedan
empire had extended outwards from Mecca and Medina till it embraced the coasts of various seas,
the consequences to the neighbouring states were as serious as the rule above mentioned would
lead us to expect that they would be. 'With the conquest of Syria and Egypt a long stretch
of sea-board had come into the Saracenic power; and the creation and maintenance of a navy
for the protection of the maritime ports as well as for meeting the enemy became a matter of
vital importance. Great attention was paid to the manning and equipment of the fleet.'[26]
At first the fleet was manned by sailors drawn from the Phoenician towns where nautical energy
was not yet quite extinct; and later the crews were recruited from Syria, Egypt, and the coasts
of Asia Minor. Ships were built at most of the Syrian and Egyptian ports, and also at Obolla
and Bushire on the Persian Gulf,' whilst the mercantile marine and maritime trade were fostered
and encouraged. The sea-power thus created was largely artificial. It drooped--as in similar
cases--when the special encouragement was withdrawn. 'In the days of Arabian energy,' says
Hallam, 'Constantinople was twice, in 668 and 716, attacked by great naval armaments.' The
same authority believes that the abandonment of such maritime enterprises by the Saracens may
be attributed to the removal of the capital from Damascus to Bagdad. The removal indicated
a lessened interest in the affairs of the Mediterranean Sea, which was now left by the administration
far behind. 'The Greeks in their turn determined to dispute the command of the sea,' with the
result that in the middle of the tenth century their empire was far more secure from its enemies
than under the first successors of Heraclius. Not only was the fall of the empire, by a rational
reliance on sea-power, postponed for centuries, but also much that had been lost was regained.
'At the close of the tenth century the emperors of Constantinople possessed the best and greatest
part' of Southern Italy, part of Sicily, the whole of what is now called the Balkan Peninsula,
Asia Minor, with some parts of Syria and Armenia.[27]

Neglect of sea-power by those who can be reached by sea brings its own punishment. Whether
neglected or not, if it is an artificial creation it is nearly sure to disappoint those who
wield it when it encounters a rival power of natural growth. How was it possible for the Crusaders,
in their various expeditions, to achieve even the transient success that occasionally crowned
their efforts? How did the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem contrive to exist for more than three-quarters
of a century? Why did the Crusades more and more become maritime expeditions? The answer to
these questions is to be found in the decline of the Mohammedan naval defences and the rising
enterprise of the seafaring people of the West. Venetians, Pisans, and Genoese transported
crusading forces, kept open the communications of the places held by the Christians, and hampered
the operations of the infidels. Even the great Saladin failed to discern the important alteration
of conditions. This is evident when we look at the efforts of the Christians to regain the
lost kingdom. Saladin 'forgot that the safety of Phoenicia lay in immunity from naval incursions,
and that no victory on land could ensure him against an influx from beyond the sea.'[28] Not
only were the Crusaders helped by the fleets of the maritime republics of Italy, they also
received reinforcements by sea from western Europe and England, on the 'arrival of MalikAnkiltar
(Richard Coeur de Lion) with twenty shiploads of fighting men and munitions of war.'

[Footnote 28: Ameer Ali, Syed, pp. 359, 360.]

Participation in the Crusades was not a solitary proof of the importance of the naval states
of Italy. That they had been able to act effectively in the Levant may have been in some measure
due to the weakening of the Mohammedans by the disintegration of the Seljukian power, the movements
of the Moguls, and the confusion consequent on the rise of the Ottomans. However that may have
been, the naval strength of those Italian states was great absolutely as well as relatively.
Sismondi, speaking of Venice, Pisa, and Genoa, towards the end of the eleventh century, says
'these three cities had more vessels on the Mediterranean than the whole of Christendom besides.'[29]
Dealing with a period two centuries later, he declares it 'difficult to comprehend how two
simple cities could put to sea such prodigious fleets as those of Pisa and Genoa.' The difficulty
disappears when we have Mahan's explanation. Sea-power was the Themistoclean instrument with
which they made a small state into a great one.

[Footnote 29: Ital.Republics, English ed., p. 29.]

A fertile source of dispute between states is the acquisition of territory beyond sea. As others
have done before and since, the maritime republics of Italy quarrelled over this. Sea-power
seemed, like Saturn, to devour its own children. In 1284, in a great sea-fight off Meloria,
the Pisans were defeated by the Genoese with heavy loss, which, as Sismondi states, 'ruined
the maritime power' of the former. From that time Genoa, transferring her activity to the Levant,
became the rival of Venice, The fleets of the two cities in 1298 met near Cyprus in an encounter,
said to be accidental, that began 'a terrible war which for seven years stained the Mediterranean
with blood and consumed immense wealth.' In the next century the two republics, 'irritated
by commercial quarrels'--like the English and Dutch afterwards--were again at war in the Levant.
Sometimes one side, sometimes the other was victorious; but the contest was exhausting to both,
and especially to Venice. Within a quarter of a century they were at war again. Hostilities
lasted till the Genoese met with the crushing defeat of Chioggia. 'From this time,' says Hallam,
'Genoa never commanded the ocean with such navies as before; her commerce gradually went into
decay; and the fifteenth century, the most splendid in the annals of Venice, is till recent
times the most ignominious in those of Genoa.' Venice seemed now to have no naval rival, and
had no fear that anyone could forbid the ceremony in which the Doge, standing in the bows of
the Bucentaur, cast a ring into the Adriatic with the words, Desponsamuste,Mare,insignumveriperpetuiquedominii.
The result of the combats at Chioggia, though fatal to it in the long-run, did not at once
destroy the naval importance of Genoa. A remarkable characteristic of sea-power is the delusive
manner in which it appears to revive after a great defeat. The Persian navy occasionally made
a brave show afterwards; but in reality it had received at Salamis a mortal wound. Athens seemed
strong enough on the sea after the catastrophe of Syracuse; but, as already stated, her naval
power had been given there a check from which it never completely recovered. The navy of Carthage
had had similar experience; and, in later ages, the power of the Turks was broken at Lepanto
and that of Spain at Gravelines notwithstanding deceptive appearances afterwards. Venice was
soon confronted on the sea by a new rival. The Turkish naval historian, Haji Khalifeh,[30]
tells us that, 'After the taking of Constantinople, when they [the Ottomans] spread their conquests
over land and sea, it became necessary to build ships and make armaments in order to subdue
the fortresses and castles on the Rumelian and Anatolian shores, and in the islands of the
Mediterranean.' Mohammed II established a great naval arsenal at Constantinople. In 1470 the
Turks, 'for the first time, equipped a fleet with which they drove that of the Venetians out
of the Grecian seas.'[31] The Turkish wars of Venice lasted a long time. In that which ended
in 1503 the decline of the Venetians' naval power was obvious. 'The Mussulmans had made progress
in naval discipline; the Venetian fleet could no longer cope with theirs.' Henceforward it
was as an allied contingent of other navies that that of Venice was regarded as important.
Dyer[32] quotes a striking passage from a letter of Æneas Sylvius, afterwards Pope Pius II,
in which the writer affirms that, if the Venetians are defeated, Christendom will not control
the sea any longer; for neither the Catalans nor the Genoese, without the Venetians, are equal
to the Turks.

SEA-POWER IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES

The last-named people, indeed, exemplified once more the rule that a military state expanding
to the sea and absorbing older maritime populations becomes a serious menace to its neighbours.
Even in the fifteenth century Mohammed II had made an attack on Southern Italy; but his sea-power
was not equal to the undertaking. Suleymân the Magnificent directed the Ottoman forces towards
the West. With admirable strategic insight he conquered Rhodes, and thus freed himself from
the danger of a hostile force on his flank. 'The centenary of the conquest of Constantinople
was past, and the Turk had developed a great naval power besides annexing Egypt and Syria.'[33]
The Turkish fleets, under such leaders as Khair-ad-din (Barbarossa), Piale, and Dragut, seemed
to command the Mediterranean including its western basin; but the repulse at Malta in 1565
was a serious check, and the defeat at Lepanto in 1571 virtually put an end to the prospect
of Turkish maritime dominion. The predominance of Portugal in the Indian Ocean in the early
part of the sixteenth century had seriously diminished the Ottoman resources. The wealth derived
from the trade in that ocean, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea, had supplied the Mohammedans
with the sinews of war, and had enabled them to contend with success against the Christians
in Europe. 'The main artery had been cut when the Portuguese took up the challenge of the Mohammedan
merchants of Calicut, and swept their ships from the ocean.'[34] The sea-power of Portugal
wisely employed had exercised a great, though unperceived, influence. Though enfeebled and
diminishing, the Turkish navy was still able to act with some effect in the seventeenth century.
Nevertheless, the sea-power of the Turks ceased to count as a factor of importance in the relations
between great states.

[Footnote 33: Seeley, BritishPolicy, i. p. 143.]

[Footnote 34: Whiteway, p. 2.]

In the meantime the state which had a leading share in winning the victory of Lepanto had been
growing up in the West. Before the union of its crown with that of Castile and the formation
of the Spanish monarchy, Aragon had been expanding till it reached the sea. It was united with
Catalonia in the twelfth century, and it conquered Valencia in the thirteenth. Amongst the
maritime states of the Mediterranean Catalonia had been conspicuous. She was to the Iberian
Peninsula much what Phoenicia had been to Syria. The Catalan navy had disputed the empire of
the Mediterranean with the fleets of Pisa and Genoa. The incorporation of Catalonia with Aragon
added greatly to the strength of that kingdom. The Aragonese kings were wise enough to understand
and liberal enough to foster the maritime interests of their new possessions.[35] Their French
and Italian neighbours were to feel, before long, the effect of this policy; and when the Spanish
monarchy had been consolidated, it was felt not only by them, but by others also. The more
Spanish dominion was extended in Italy, the more were the naval resources at the command of
Spain augmented. Genoa became 'Spain's water-gate to Italy.... Henceforth the Spanish crown
found in the Dorias its admirals; their squadron was permanently hired to the kings of Spain.'
Spanish supremacy at sea was established at the expense of France.[36] The acquisition of a
vast domain in the New World had greatly developed the maritime activity of Castile, and Spain
was as formidable on the ocean as in the Mediterranean. After Portugal had been annexed the
naval vessels of that country were added to the Spanish, and the great port of Lisbon became
available as a place of equipment and as an additional base of operations for oceanic campaigns.
The fusion of Spain and Portugal, says Seeley, 'produced a single state of unlimited maritime
dominion.... Henceforth the whole New World belonged exclusively to Spain.' The story of the
tremendous catastrophe--the defeat of the Armada--by which the decline of this dominion was
heralded is well known. It is memorable, not only because of the harm it did to Spain, but
also because it revealed the rise of another claimant to maritime pre-eminence--the English
nation. The effects of the catastrophe were not at once visible. Spain still continued to look
like the greatest power in the world; and, though the English seamen were seen to be something
better than adventurous pirates--a character suggested by some of their recent exploits--few
could have comprehended that they were engaged in building up what was to be a sea-power greater
than any known to history.

[Footnote 35: Prescott, FerdinandandIsabella, Introd. sects. i. ii.]

[Footnote 36: G. W. Prothero, in M. Hume's Spain, 1479-1788, p. 65.]

They were carrying forward, not beginning the building of this. 'England,' says Sir J. K. Laughton,
'had always believed in her naval power, had always claimed the sovereignty of the Narrow Seas;
and more than two hundred years before Elizabeth came to the throne, Edward III had testified
to his sense of its importance by ordering a gold coinage bearing a device showing the armed
strength and sovereignty of England based on the sea.'[37] It is impossible to make intelligible
the course of the many wars which the English waged with the French in the Middle Ages unless
the true naval position of the former is rightly appreciated. Why were Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt--not
to mention other combats--fought, not on English, but on continental soil? Why during the so-called
'Hundred Years' War' was England in reality the invader and not the invaded? We of the present
generation are at last aware of the significance of naval defence, and know that, if properly
utilised, it is the best security against invasion that a sea-surrounded state can enjoy. It
is not, however, commonly remembered that the same condition of security existed and was properly
valued in mediæval times. The battle of Sluys in 1340 rendered invasion of England as impracticable
as did that of La Hogue in 1692, that of Quiberon Bay in 1759, and that of Trafalgar in 1805;
and it permitted, as did those battles, the transport of troops to the continent to support
our allies in wars which, had we not been strong at sea, would have been waged on the soil
of our own country. Our early continental wars, therefore, are proofs of the long-established
efficiency of our naval defences. Notwithstanding the greater attention paid, within the last
dozen years or so, to naval affairs, it is doubtful if the country generally even yet recognises
the extent to which its security depends upon a good fleet as fully as our ancestors did nearly
seven centuries ago. The narrative of our pre-Elizabethan campaigns is interesting merely as
a story; and, when told--as for instance D. Hannay has told it in the introductory chapters
of his 'Short History of the Royal Navy'--it will be found instructive and worthy of careful
study at the present day. Each of the principal events in our early naval campaigns may be
taken as an illustration of the idea conveyed by the term 'sea-power,' and of the accuracy
with which its meaning was apprehended at the time. To take a very early case, we may cite
the defeat of Eustace the Monk by Hubert de Burgh in 1217. Reinforcements and supplies had
been collected at Calais for conveyance to the army of Prince Louis of France and the rebel
barons who had been defeated at Lincoln. The reinforcements tried to cross the Channel under
the escort of a fleet commanded by Eustace. Hubert de Burgh, who had stoutly held Dover for
King John, and was faithful to the young Henry III, heard of the enemy's movements. 'If these
people land,' said he, 'England is lost; let us therefore boldly meet them.' He reasoned in
almost the same words as Raleigh about four centuries afterwards, and undoubtedly 'had grasped
the true principles of the defence of England.' He put to sea and defeated his opponent. The
fleet on which Prince Louis and the rebellious barons had counted was destroyed; and with it
their enterprise. 'No more admirably planned, no more fruitful battle has been fought by Englishmen
on water.'[38] As introductory to a long series of naval operations undertaken with a like
object, it has deserved detailed mention here.

[Footnote 37: Armada, Introd. (Navy Records Society).]

[Footnote 38: Hannay, p. 7.]

The sixteenth century was marked by a decided advance in both the development and the application
of sea-power. Previously its operation had been confined to the Mediterranean or to coast waters
outside it. Spanish or Basque seamen--by their proceedings in the English Channel--had proved
the practicability of, rather than been engaged in, ocean warfare. The English, who withstood
them, were accustomed to seas so rough, to seasons so uncertain, and to weather so boisterous,
that the ocean had few terrors for them. All that was wanting was a sufficient inducement to
seek distant fields of action and a development of the naval art that would permit them to
be reached. The discovery of the New World supplied the first; the consequently increased length
of voyages and of absence from the coast led to the second. The world had been moving onwards
in other things as well as in navigation. Intercommunication was becoming more and more frequent.
What was done by one people was soon known to others. It is a mistake to suppose that, because
the English had been behindhand in the exploration of remote regions, they were wanting in
maritime enterprise. The career of the Cabots would of itself suffice to render such a supposition
doubtful. The English had two good reasons for postponing voyages to and settlement in far-off
lands. They had their hands full nearer home; and they thoroughly, and as it were by instinct,
understood the conditions on which permanent expansion must rest. They wanted to make sure
of the line of communication first. To effect this a sea-going marine of both war and commerce
and, for further expansion, stations on the way were essential. The chart of the world furnishes
evidence of the wisdom and the thoroughness of their procedure. Taught by the experience of
the Spaniards and the Portuguese, when unimpeded by the political circumstances of the time,
and provided with suitable equipment, the English displayed their energy in distant seas. It
now became simply a question of the efficiency of sea-power. If this was not a quality of that
of the English, then their efforts were bound to fail; and, more than this, the position of
their country, challenging as it did what was believed to be the greatest of maritime states,
would have been altogether precarious. The principal expeditions now undertaken were distinguished
by a characteristic peculiar to the people, and not to be found in connection with the exploring
or colonising activity of most other great nations even down to our own time. They were really
unofficial speculations in which, if the Government took part at all, it was for the sake of
the profit expected and almost, if not exactly, like any private adventurer. The participation
of the Government, nevertheless, had an aspect which it is worth while to note. It conveyed
a hint--and quite consciously--to all whom it might concern that the speculations were 'under-written'
by the whole sea-power of England. The forces of more than one state had been used to protect
its maritime trade from the assaults of enemies in the Mediterranean or in the Narrow Seas.
They had been used to ward off invasion and to keep open communications across not very extensive
areas of water. In the sixteenth century they were first relied upon to support distant commerce,
whether carried on in a peaceful fashion or under aggressive forms. This, naturally enough,
led to collisions. The contention waxed hot, and was virtually decided when the Armada shaped
course to the northward after the fight off Gravelines.

The expeditions against the Spanish Indies and, still more, those against Philip II's peninsular
territory, had helped to define the limitations of sea-power. It became evident, and it was
made still more evident in the next century, that for a great country to be strong it must
not rely upon a navy alone. It must also have an adequate and properly organised mobile army.
Notwithstanding the number of times that this lesson has been repeated, we have been slow to
learn it. It is doubtful if we have learned it even yet. English seamen in all ages seem to
have mastered it fully; for they have always demanded--at any rate for upwards of three centuries--that
expeditions against foreign territory over-sea should be accompanied by a proper number of
land-troops. On the other hand, the necessity of organising the army of a maritime insular
state, and of training it with the object of rendering effective aid in operations of the kind
in question, has rarely been perceived and acted upon by others. The result has been a long
series of inglorious or disastrous affairs like the West Indies voyage of 1595-96, the Cadiz
expedition of 1625, and that to the Ile de Ré of 1627. Additions might be made to the list.
The failures of joint expeditions have often been explained by alleging differences or quarrels
between the naval and the military commanders. This way of explaining them, however, is nothing
but the inveterate critical method of the streets by which cause is taken for effect and effect
for cause. The differences and quarrels arose, no doubt; but they generally sprang out of the
recriminations consequent on, not producing, the want of success. Another manifestation of
the way in which sea-power works was first observed in the seventeenth century. It suggested
the adoption of, and furnished the instrument for carrying out a distinct maritime policy.
What was practically a standing navy had come into existence. As regards England this phenomenon
was now of respectable age. Long voyages and cruises of several ships in company had been frequent
during the latter half of the sixteenth century and the early part of the seventeenth. Even
the grandfathers of the men who sailed with Blake and Penn in 1652 could not have known a time
when ships had never crossed the ocean, and squadrons kept together for months had never cruised.
However imperfect it may have been, a system of provisioning ships and supplying them with
stores, and of preserving discipline amongst their crews, had been developed, and had proved
fairly satisfactory. The Parliament and the Protector in turn found it necessary to keep a
considerable number of ships in commission, and make them cruise and operate in company. It
was not till well on in the reign of Queen Victoria that the man-of-war's man was finally differentiated
from the merchant seaman; but two centuries before some of the distinctive marks of the former
had already begun to be noticeable. There were seamen in the time of the Commonwealth who rarely,
perhaps some who never, served afloat except in a man-of-war. Some of the interesting naval
families which were settled at Portsmouth and the eastern ports, and which--from father to
son--helped to recruit the ranks of our bluejackets till a date later than that of the launch
of the first ironclad, could carry back their professional genealogy to at least the days of
Charles II, when, in all probability, it did not first start. Though landsmen continued even
after the civil war to be given naval appointments, and though a permanent corps, through the
ranks of which everyone must pass, had not been formally established, a body of real naval
officers--men who could handle their ships, supervise the working of the armament, and exercise
military command--had been formed. A navy, accordingly, was now a weapon of undoubted keenness,
capable of very effective use by anyone who knew how to wield it. Having tasted the sweets
of intercourse with the Indies, whether in the occupation of Portugal or of Spain, both English
and Dutch were desirous of getting a larger share of them. English maritime commerce had increased
and needed naval protection. If England was to maintain the international position to which,
as no one denied, she was entitled, that commerce must be permitted to expand. The minds of
men in western Europe, moreover, were set upon obtaining for their country territories in the
New World, the amenities of which were now known. From the reign of James I the Dutch had shown
great jealousy of English maritime enterprise. Where it was possible, as in the East Indian
Archipelago, they had destroyed it. Their naval resources were great enough to let them hold
English shipping at their mercy, unless a vigorous effort were made to protect it. The Dutch
conducted the carrying trade of a great part of the world, and the monopoly of this they were
resolved to keep, while the English were resolved to share in it. The exclusion of the English
from every trade-route, except such as ran by their own coast or crossed the Narrow Seas, seemed
a by no means impossible contingency. There seemed also to be but one way of preventing it,
viz. by war. The supposed unfriendliness of the Dutch, or at least of an important party amongst
them, to the regicide Government in England helped to force the conflict. The Navigation Act
of 1651 was passed and regarded as a covert declaration of hostilities. So the first Dutch
war began. It established our claim to compete for the position of a great maritime commercial
power.

The rise of the sea-power of the Dutch, and the magnitude which it attained in a short time
and in the most adverse circumstances, have no parallel in history. The case of Athens was
different, because the Athenian power had not so much been unconsciously developed out of a
great maritime trade, as based on a military marine deliberately and persistently fostered
during many years. Thirlwall believes that it was Solon who 'laid the foundations of the Attic
navy,'[39] a century before Salamis. The great achievement of Themistocles was to convince
his fellow-citizens that their navy ought to be increased. Perhaps the nearest parallel with
the power of the Dutch was presented by that of Rhodes, which rested largely on a carrying
trade. The Rhodian undertakings, however, were by comparison small and restricted in extent.
Motley declares of the Seven United Provinces that they 'commanded the ocean,'[40] and that
it would be difficult to exaggerate the naval power of the young Commonwealth. Even in the
days of Spain's greatness English seamen positively declined to admit that she was stronger
than England on the sea; and the story of the Armada justified their view. Our first two Dutch
wars were, therefore, contests between the two foremost naval states of the world for what
was primarily a maritime object. The identity of the cause of the first and of the second war
will be discerned by anyone who compares what has been said about the circumstances leading
to the former, with Monk's remark as to the latter. He said that the English wanted a larger
share of the trade enjoyed by the Dutch. It was quite in accordance with the spirit of the
age that the Dutch should try to prevent, by force, this want from being satisfied. Anything
like free and open competition was repugnant to the general feeling. The high road to both
individual wealth and national prosperity was believed to lie in securing a monopoly. Merchants
or manufacturers who called for the abolition of monopolies granted to particular courtiers
and favourites had not the smallest intention, on gaining their object, of throwing open to
the enterprise of all what had been monopolised. It was to be kept for the exclusive benefit
of some privileged or chartered company. It was the same in greater affairs. The skill and
enterprise of the Dutch having enabled them to force themselves into this trade, they were
determined to keep it to themselves. The Dutch East India Company was a powerful body, and
largely dictated the maritime policy of the country. We have thus come to an interesting point
in the historical consideration of sea-power. The Elizabethan conflict with Spain had practically
settled the question whether or not the expanding nations were to be allowed to extend their
activities to territories in the New World. The first two Dutch wars were to settle the question
whether or not the ocean trade of the world was to be open to any people qualified to engage
in it. We can see how largely these were maritime questions, how much depended on the solution
found for them, and how plain it was that they must be settled by naval means.

[Footnote 39: Hist.Greece, ii. p. 52.]

[Footnote 40: UnitedNetherlands, ii. p. 132.]

Mahan's great survey of sea-power opens in 1660, midway between the first and second Dutch
wars. 'The sailing-ship era, with its distinctive features,' he tells us, 'had fairly begun.'
The art of war by sea, in its more important details, had been settled by the first war. From
the beginning of the second the general features of ship design, the classification of ships,
the armament of ships, and the handling of fleets, were to remain without essential alteration
until the date of Navarino. Even the tactical methods, except where improved on occasions by
individual genius, altered little. The great thing was to bring the whole broadside force to
bear on an enemy. Whether this was to be impartially distributed throughout the hostile line
or concentrated on one part of it depended on the character of particular admirals. It would
have been strange if a period so long and so rich in incidents had afforded no materials for
forming a judgment on the real significance of sea-power. The text, so to speak, chosen by
Mahan is that, notwithstanding the changes wrought in naval matériel during the last half-century,
we can find in the history of the past instructive illustrations of the general principles
of maritime war. These illustrations will prove of value not only 'in those wider operations
which embrace a whole theatre of war,' but also, if rightly applied, 'in the tactical use of
the ships and weapons' of our own day. By a remarkable coincidence the same doctrine was being
preached at the same time and quite independently by the late Vice-Admiral Philip Colomb in
his work on 'Naval Warfare.' As a prelude to the second Dutch war we find a repetition of a
process which had been adopted somewhat earlier. That was the permanent conquest of trans-oceanic
territory. Until the seventeenth century had well begun, naval, or combined naval and military,
operations against the distant possessions of an enemy had been practically restricted to raiding
or plundering attacks on commercial centres. The Portuguese territory in South America having
come under Spanish dominion in consequence of the annexation of Portugal to Spain, the Dutch--as
the power of the latter country declined--attempted to reduce part of that territory into permanent
possession. This improvement on the practice of Drake and others was soon seen to be a game
at which more than one could play. An expedition sent by Cromwell to the West Indies seized
the Spanish island of Jamaica, which has remained in the hands of its conquerors to this day.
In 1664 an English force occupied the Dutch North American settlements on the Hudson. Though
the dispossessed rulers were not quite in a position to throw stones at sinners, this was rather
a raid than an operation of recognised warfare, because it preceded the formal outbreak of
hostilities. The conquered territory remained in English hands for more than a century, and
thus testified to the efficacy of a sea-power which Europe had scarcely begun to recognise.
Neither the second nor the third Dutch war can be counted amongst the occurrences to which
Englishmen may look back with unalloyed satisfaction; but they, unquestionably, disclosed some
interesting manifestations of sea-power. Much indignation has been expressed concerning the
corruption and inefficiency of the English Government of the day, and its failure to take proper
measures for keeping up the navy as it should have been kept up. Some, perhaps a good deal,
of this indignation was deserved; but it would have been nearly as well deserved by every other
government of the day. Even in those homes of political virtue where the administrative machinery
was worked by or in the interest of speculating capitalists and privileged companies, the accumulating
evidence of late years has proved that everything was not considered to be, and as a matter
of fact was not, exactly as it ought to have been. Charles II and his brother, the Duke of
York, have been held up to obloquy because they thought that the coast of England could be
defended against a naval enemy better by fortifications than by a good fleet and, as Pepys
noted, were 'not ashamed of it.' The truth is that neither the king nor the duke believed in
the power of a navy to ward off attack from an island. This may have been due to want of intellectual
capacity; but it would be going a long way to put it down to personal wickedness. They have
had many imitators, some in our own day. The huge forts which stud the coast of the United
Kingdom, and have been erected within the memory of the present generation, are monuments,
likely to last for many years, of the inability of people, whom no one could accuse of being
vicious, to rate sea-power at its proper value. It is much more likely that it was owing to
a reluctance to study questions of naval defence as industriously as they deserved, and to
that moral timidity which so often tempts even men of proved physical courage to undertake
the impossible task of making themselves absolutely safe against hostile efforts at every point.

Charles II has also been charged with indifference to the interests of his country, or worse,
because during a great naval war he adopted the plan of trying to weaken the enemy by destroying
his commerce. Anyhow, if the king erred, as he undoubtedly did, he erred in good company. Mahan's
works are, in a sense, a formal warning to his fellow-citizens not to adopt it. In France,
within the last years of the nineteenth century, it found, and appears still to find, adherents
enough to form a school. The reappearance of belief in demonstrated impossibilities is a recognised
incident in human history; but it is usually confined to the emotional or the vulgar. It is
serious and filled with menaces of disaster when it is held by men thought fit to administer
the affairs of a nation or advise concerning its defence. The third Dutch war may not have
settled directly the position of England in the maritime world; but it helped to place that
country above all other maritime states,--in the position, in fact, which Great Britain, the
United Kingdom, the British Empire, whichever name may be given it, has retained up to the
present. It also manifested in a very striking form the efficacy of sea-power. The United Provinces,
though attacked by two of the greatest monarchies in the world, France and England, were not
destroyed. Indeed, they preserved much of their political importance in the State system of Europe.

[Footnote 41: Mommsen, ii. p. 52.]

The war which was ended by the Peace of Ryswick in 1697 presents two features of exceptional
interest: one was the havoc wrought on English commerce by the enemy; the other was Torrington's
conduct at and after the engagement off Beachy Head. Mahan discusses the former with his usual
lucidity. The explanation is that Louis XIV made great efforts to keep up powerful fleets.
Our navy was so fully occupied in watching these that no ships could be spared to protect our
maritime trade. This is only another way of saying that our commerce had increased so largely
that the navy was not strong enough to look after it as well as oppose the enemy's main force.
Notwithstanding our losses we were on the winning side in the conflict. Much misery and ruin
had been caused, but not enough to affect the issue of the war.

Torrington's proceedings in July 1690 were at the time the subject of much angry debate. The
debate, still meriting the epithet angry, has been renewed within the last few years. The matter
has to be noticed here, because it involves the consideration of a question of naval strategy
which must be understood by those who wish to know the real meaning of the term sea-power,
and who ought to learn that it is not a thing to be idly risked or thrown away at the bidding
of the ignorant and the irresponsible. Arthur Herbert, Earl of Torrington--the later peerage
is a viscounty held by the Byng family--was in command of the allied English and Dutch fleet
in the Channel. 'The disparity of force,' says Mahan, 'was still in favour of France in 1690,
but it was not so great as the year before.' We can measure the ability of the then English
Government for conducting a great war, when we know that, in its wisdom, it had still further
weakened our fleet by dividing it (Vice-Admiral Killigrew having been sent to the Mediterranean
with a squadron), and had neglected, and indeed refused when urged, to take the necessary steps
to repair this error. The Government having omitted, as even British Governments sometimes
do, to gain any trustworthy intelligence of the strength or movements of the enemy, Torrington
suddenly found himself confronted by a considerably superior French fleet under Tourville,
one of the greatest of French sea-officers. Of late years the intentions of the French have
been questioned; but it is beyond dispute that in England at the time Tourville's movements
were believed to be preliminary to invasion. Whether Tourville deliberately meant his movement
to cover an invasion or not, invasion would almost certainly have followed complete success
on his part; otherwise his victory would have been without any valuable result. Torrington
saw that as long as he could keep his own fleet intact, he could, though much weaker than his
opponent, prevent him from doing serious harm. Though personally not a believer in the imminence
of invasion, the English admiral knew that 'most men were in fear that the French would invade.'
His own view was, 'that whilst we had a fleet in being they would not dare to make an attempt.'
Of late years controversy has raged round this phrase, 'a fleet in being,' and the strategic
principle which it expresses. Most seamen were at the time, have been since, and still are
in agreement with Torrington. This might be supposed enough to settle the question. It has
not been allowed, however, to remain one of purely naval strategy. It was made at the time
a matter of party politics. This is why it is so necessary that in a notice of sea-power it
should be discussed. Both as a strategist and as a tactician Torrington was immeasurably ahead
of his contemporaries. The only English admirals who can be placed above him are Hawke and
Nelson. He paid the penalty of his pre-eminence: he could not make ignorant men and dull men
see the meaning or the advantages of his proceedings. Mahan, who is specially qualified to
do him full justice, does not devote much space in his work to a consideration of Torrington's
case, evidently because he had no sufficient materials before him on which to form a judgment.
The admiral's character had been taken away already by Macaulay, who did have ample evidence
before him. William III, with all his fine qualities, did not possess a military genius quite
equal to that of Napoleon; and Napoleon, in naval strategy, was often wrong. William III understood
that subject even less than the French emperor did; and his favourites were still less capable
of understanding it. Consequently Torrington's action has been put down to jealousy of the
Dutch. There have been people who accused Nelson of being jealous of the naval reputation of
Caracciolo! The explanation of Torrington's conduct is this:-- He had a fleet so much weaker
than Tourville's that he could not fight a general action with the latter without a practical
certainty of getting a crushing defeat. Such a result would have laid the kingdom open: a defeat
of the allied fleet, says Mahan, 'if sufficiently severe, might involve the fall of William's
throne in England.' Given certain movements of the French fleet, Torrington might have manoeuvred
to slip past it to the westward and join his force with that under Killigrew, which would make
him strong enough to hazard a battle. This proved impracticable. There was then one course
left. To retire before the French, but not to keep far from them. He knew that, though not
strong enough to engage their whole otherwise unemployed fleet with any hope of success, he
would be quite strong enough to fight and most likely beat it, when a part of it was trying
either to deal with our ships to the westward or to cover the disembarkation of an invading
army. He, therefore, proposed to keep his fleet 'in being' in order to fall on the enemy when
the latter would have two affairs at the same time on his hands. The late Vice-Admiral Colomb
rose to a greater height than was usual even with him in his criticism of this campaign. What
Torrington did was merely to reproduce on the sea what has been noticed dozens of times on
shore, viz. the menace by the flanking enemy. For the crime of being a good strategist he was
brought before a court-martial, but acquitted. His sovereign, who had been given the crowns
of three kingdoms to defend our laws, showed his respect for them by flouting a legally constituted
tribunal and disregarding its solemn finding. The admiral who had saved his country was forced
into retirement. Still, the principle of the 'fleet in being' lies at the bottom of all sound
strategy.

Admiral Colomb has pointed out a great change of plan in the later naval campaigns of the seventeenth
century. Improvements in naval architecture, in the methods of preserving food, and in the
arrangements for keeping the crews healthy, permitted fleets to be employed at a distance from
their home ports for long continuous periods. The Dutch, when allies of the Spaniards, kept
a fleet in the Mediterranean for many months. The great De Ruyter was mortally wounded in one
of the battles there fought. In the war of the Spanish Succession the Anglo-Dutch fleet found
its principal scene of action eastward of Gibraltar. This, as it were, set the fashion for
future wars. It became a kind of tacitly accepted rule that the operation of British sea-power
was to be felt in the enemy's rather than in our own waters. The hostile coast was regarded
strategically as the British frontier, and the sea was looked upon as territory which the enemy
must be prevented from invading. Acceptance of this principle led in time to the so-called
'blockades' of Brest and Toulon. The name was misleading. As Nelson took care to explain, there
was no desire to keep the enemy's fleet in; what was desired was to be near enough to attack
it if it came out. The wisdom of the plan is undoubted. The hostile navy could be more easily
watched and more easily followed if it put to sea. To carry out this plan a navy stronger in
number of ships or in general efficiency than that of the enemy was necessary to us. With the
exception of that of American Independence, which will therefore require special notice, our
subsequent great wars were conducted in accordance with the rule.

SEA-POWER IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND EARLY PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

In the early part of the eighteenth century there was a remarkable manifestation of sea-power
in the Baltic. Peter the Great, having created an efficient army, drove the Swedes from the
coast provinces south of the Gulf of Finland. Like the earlier monarchies of which we have
spoken, Russia, in the Baltic at least, now became a naval state. A large fleet was built,
and, indeed, a considerable navy established. It was a purely artificial creation, and showed
the merits and defects of its character. At first, and when under the eye of its creator, it
was strong; when Peter was no more it dwindled away and, when needed again, had to be created
afresh. It enabled Peter the Great to conquer the neighbouring portion of Finland, to secure
his coast territories, and to dominate the Baltic. In this he was assisted by the exhaustion
of Sweden consequent on her endeavours to retain, what was no longer possible, the position
of a quasi great power which she had held since the days of Gustavus Adolphus. Sweden had been
further weakened, especially as a naval state, by almost incessant wars with Denmark, which
prevented all hope of Scandinavian predominance in the Baltic, the control of which sea has
in our own days passed into the hands of another state possessing a quickly created navy--the
modern German empire.

The war of the Spanish Succession left Great Britain a Mediterranean power, a position which,
in spite of twice losing Minorca, she still holds. The Seven Years' war included some brilliant
displays of the efficacy of sea-power. It was this which put the British in possession of Canada,
decided which European race was to rule in India, and led to a British occupation of Havannah
in one hemisphere and of Manila in the other. In the same war we learned how, by a feeble use
of sea-power, a valuable possession like Minorca may be lost. At the same time our maritime
trade and the general prosperity of the kingdom increased enormously. The result of the conflict
made plain to all the paramount importance of having in the principal posts in the Government
men capable of understanding what war is and how it ought to be conducted.

[Footnote 42: Mahan, Inf.onHist. p. 280.]

This lesson, as the sequel demonstrated, had not been learned when Great Britain became involved
in a war with the insurgent colonies in North America. They quite ignored the teaching of the
then comparatively recent wars which has been alluded to already--that we should look upon
the enemy's coast as our frontier. A century and a half earlier the Dutchman Grotius had written--

  Quæ meta Britannis
  Litora sunt aliis.

[Footnote 43: InfluenceonHist. p. 338.]

Though ordinary prudence would have suggested ample preparation, British ministers allowed
their country to remain unprepared. Instead of concentrating their efforts on the main objective,
they frittered away force in attempts to relieve two beleaguered garrisons under the pretext
of yielding to popular pressure, which is the official term for acting on the advice of irresponsible
and uninstructed busybodies. 'Depuis le début de la crise,' says Captain Chevalier, 'les ministres
de la Grande Bretagne s'étaient montrés inférieurs à leur tâche.' An impressive result of this
was the repeated appearance of powerful and indeed numerically superior hostile fleets in the
English Channel. The war--notwithstanding that, perhaps because, land operations constituted
an important part of it, and in the end settled the issue--was essentially oceanic. Captain
Mahan says it was 'purely maritime.' It may be true that, whatever the belligerent result,
the political result, as regards the status of the insurgent colonies, would have been the
same. It is in the highest degree probable, indeed it closely approaches to certainty, that
a proper use of the British sea-power would have prevented independence from being conquered,
as it were, at the point of the bayonet. There can be no surprise in store for the student
acquainted with the vagaries of strategists who are influenced in war by political in preference
to military requirements. Still, it is difficult to repress an emotion of astonishment on finding
that a British Government intentionally permitted De Grasse's fleet and the French army in
its convoy to cross the Atlantic unmolested, for fear of postponing for a time the revictualling
of the garrison beleaguered at Gibraltar. At the point of contact with the enemy, however,
it was not in general so conspicuously successful as it was in the Seven Years' war, or as
it was to be in the great conflict with the French republic and empire. The truth is that its
opponent, the French navy, was never so thoroughly a sea-going force as it was in the war of
American Independence; and never so closely approached our own in real sea-experience as it
did during that period. We met antagonists who were very nearly, but, fortunately for us, not
quite as familiar with the sea as we were ourselves; and we never found it so hard to beat
them, or even to avoid being beaten by them. An Englishman would, naturally enough, start at
the conclusion confronting him, if he were to speculate as to the result of more than one battle
had the great Suffren's captains and crews been quite up to the level of those commanded by
stout old Sir Edward Hughes. Suffren, it should be said, before going to the East Indies, had
'thirty-eight years of almost uninterrupted sea-service.'[44] A glance at a chart of the world,
with the scenes of the general actions of the war dotted on it, will show how notably oceanic
the campaigns were. The hostile fleets met over and over again on the far side of the Atlantic
and in distant Indian seas. The French navy had penetrated into the ocean as readily and as
far as we could do ourselves. Besides this, it should be remembered that it was not until the
12th April 1782. when Rodney in one hemisphere and Suffren in the other showed them the way,
that our officers were able to escape from the fetters imposed on them by the Fighting Instructions,--a
fact worth remembering in days in which it is sometimes proposed, by establishing schools of
naval tactics on shore, to revive the pedantry which made a decisive success in battle nearly
impossible.

[Footnote 44: Laughton, StudiesinNavalHist. p. 103.]

The mighty conflict which raged between Great Britain on one side and France and her allies
on the other, with little intermission, for more than twenty years, presents a different aspect
from that of the war last mentioned. The victories which the British fleet was to gain were
generally to be overwhelming; if not, they were looked upon as almost defeats. Whether the
fleet opposed to ours was, or was not, the more numerous, the result was generally the same--our
enemy was beaten. That there was a reason for this which can be discovered is certain. A great
deal has been made of the disorganisation in the French navy consequent on the confusion of
the Revolution. That there was disorganisation is undoubted; that it did impair discipline
and, consequently, general efficiency will not be disputed; but that it was considerable enough
to account by itself for the French naval defeats is altogether inadmissible. Revolutionary
disorder had invaded the land-forces to a greater degree than it had invaded the sea-forces.
The supersession, flight, or guillotining of army officers had been beyond measure more frequent
than was the case with the naval officers. In spite of all this the French armies were on the
whole--even in the early days of the Revolution--extraordinarily successful. In 1792 'the most
formidable invasion that ever threatened France,' as Alison calls it, was repelled, though
the invaders were the highly disciplined and veteran armies of Prussia and Austria. It was
nearly two years later that the French and English fleets came into serious conflict. The first
great battle, which we call 'The Glorious First of June,' though a tactical victory for us,
was a strategical defeat. Villaret-Joyeuse manoeuvred so as to cover the arrival in France
of a fleet of merchant vessels carrying sorely needed supplies of food, and in this he was
completely successful. His plan involved the probability, almost the necessity, of fighting
a general action which he was not at all sure of winning. He was beaten, it is true; but the
French made so good a fight of it that their defeat was not nearly so disastrous as the later
defeats of the Nile or Trafalgar, and--at the most--not more disastrous than that of Dominica.
Yet no one even alleges that there was disorder or disorganisation in the French fleet at the
date of anyone of those affairs. Indeed, if the French navy was really disorganised in 1794,
it would have been better for France--judging from the events of 1798 and 1805--if the disorganisation
had been allowed to continue. In point of organisation the British Navy was inferior, and in
point of discipline not much superior to the French at the earliest date; at the later dates,
and especially at the latest, owing to the all-pervading energy of Napoleon, the British was
far behind its rival in organisation, in 'science,' and in every branch of training that can
be imparted without going to sea. We had the immense advantage of counting amongst our officers
some very able men. Nelson, of course, stands so high that he holds a place entirely by himself.
The other British chiefs, good as they were, were not conspicuously superior to the Hawkes
and Rodneys of an earlier day. Howe was a great commander, but he did little more than just
appear on the scene in the war. Almost the same may be said of Hood, of whom Nelson wrote,
'He is the greatest sea-officer I ever knew.'[45] There must have been something, therefore,
beyond the meritorious qualities of our principal officers which helped us so consistently
to victory. The many triumphs won could not have been due in every case to the individual superiority
of the British admiral or captain to his opponent. There must have been bad as well as good
amongst the hundreds on our lists; and we cannot suppose that Providence had so arranged it
that in every action in which a British officer of inferior ability commanded a still inferior
French commander was opposed to him. The explanation of our nearly unbroken success is, that
the British was a thoroughly sea-going navy, and became more and more so every month; whilst
the French, since the close of the American war, had lost to a great extent its sea-going character
and, because we shut it up in its ports, became less and less sea-going as hostilities continued.
The war had been for us, in the words of Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, 'a continuous course of victory
won mainly by seamanship.' Our navy, as regards sea-experience, especially of the officers,
was immensely superior to the French. This enabled the British Government to carry into execution
sound strategic plans, in accordance with which the coasts of France and its dependent or allied
countries were regarded as the English frontier to be watched or patrolled by our fleets.

[Footnote 45: Laughton, Nelson'sLett.andDesp. p. 71.]

Before the long European war had been brought to a formal ending we received some rude rebuffs
from another opponent of unsuspected vigour. In the quarrel with the United States, the so-called
'War of 1812,' the great sea-power of the British in the end asserted its influence, and our
antagonists suffered much more severely, even absolutely, than ourselves. At the same time
we might have learned, for the Americans did their best to teach us, that over-confidence in
numerical strength and narrow professional self-satisfaction are nearly sure to lead to reverses
in war, and not unlikely to end in grave disasters. We had now to meet the élite of one of
the finest communities of seamen ever known. Even in 1776 the Americans had a great maritime
commerce, which, as Mahan informs us, 'had come to be the wonder of the statesmen of the mother
country.' In the six-and-thirty years which had elapsed since then this commerce had further
increased. There was no finer nursery of seamen than the then states of the American Union.
The men who passed through this practical, and therefore supremely excellent, training school
were numerous. Very many had been trained in English men-of-war, and some in French ships.
The state navy which they were called on to man was small; and therefore its personnel, though
without any regular or avowed selection, was virtually and in the highest sense a picked body.
The lesson of the war of 1812 should be learned by Englishmen of the present day, when a long
naval peace has generated a confidence in numerical superiority, in the mere possession of
heavier matériel, and in the merits of a rigidly uniform system of training, which confidence,
as experience has shown, is too often the forerunner of misfortune. It is neither patriotic
nor intelligent to minimise the American successes. Certainly they have been exaggerated by
Americans and even by ourselves. To take the frigate actions alone, as being those which properly
attracted most attention, we see that the captures in action amounted to three on each side,
the proportionate loss to our opponents, considering the smallness of their fleet, being immensely
greater than ours. We also see that no British frigate was taken after the first seven months
of a war which lasted two and a half years, and that no British frigate succumbed except to
admittedly superior force. Attempts have been made to spread a belief that our reverses were
due to nothing but the greater size and heavier guns of our enemy's ships. It is now established
that the superiority in these details, which the Americans certainly enjoyed, was not great,
and not of itself enough to account for their victories. Of course, if superiority in mere
matériel, beyond a certain well-understood amount, is possessed by one of two combatants, his
antagonist can hardly escape defeat; but it was never alleged that size of ship or calibre
of guns--greater within reasonable limits than we had--necessarily led to the defeat of British
ships by the French or Spaniards. In the words of Admiral Jurien de la Gravière, 'The ships
of the United States constantly fought with the chances in their favour.' All this is indisputable.
Nevertheless we ought to see to it that in any future war our sea-power, great as it may be,
does not receive shocks like those that it unquestionably did receive in 1812.

[Footnote 46: NavalWarof1812, 3rd ed. pp. 29, 30.]

SEA-POWER IN RECENT TIMES

We have now come to the end of the days of the naval wars of old time. The subsequent period
has been illustrated repeatedly by manifestations of sea-power, often of great interest and
importance, though rarely understood or even discerned by the nations which they more particularly
concerned. The British sea-power, notwithstanding the first year of the war of 1812, had come
out of the great European conflict unshaken and indeed more preeminent than ever. The words
used, half a century before by a writer in the great French 'Encyclopédie,' seemed more exact
than when first written. 'L'empiredesmers,' he says, is, 'le plus avantageux de tous les empires;
les Phoeniciens le possédoient autre fois et c'est aux Anglois que cette gloire appartient
aujourd'hui sur toutes les puissances maritimes.'[47] Vast out-lying territories had been acquired
or were more firmly held, and the communications of all the over-sea dominions of the British
Crown were secured against all possibility of serious menace for many years to come. Our sea-power
was so ubiquitous and all-pervading that, like the atmosphere, we rarely thought of it and
rarely remembered its necessity or its existence. It was not till recently that the greater
part of the nation--for there were many, and still are some exceptions--perceived that it was
the medium apart from which the British Empire could no more live than it could have grown
up. Forty years after the fall of Napoleon we found ourselves again at war with a great power.
We had as our ally the owner of the greatest navy in the world except our own. Our foe, as
regards his naval forces, came the next in order. Yet so overwhelming was the strength of Great
Britain and France on the sea that Russia never attempted to employ her navy against them.
Not to mention other expeditions, considerable enough in themselves, military operations on
the largest scale were undertaken, carried on for many months, and brought to a successful
termination on a scene so remote that it was two thousand miles from the country of one, and
three thousand from that of the other partner in the alliance. At the close of the Russian
war we encountered, and unhappily for us in influential positions, men who, undismayed by the
consequences of mimicking in free England the cast-iron methods of the Great Frederick, began
to measure British requirements by standards borrowed from abroad and altogether inapplicable
to British conditions. Because other countries wisely abstained from relying on that which
they did not possess, or had only imperfectly and with elaborate art created, the mistress
of the seas was led to proclaim her disbelief in the very force that had made and kept her
dominion, and urged to defend herself with fortifications by advisers who, like Charles II
and the Duke of York two centuries before, were 'not ashamed of it.' It was long before the
peril into which this brought the empire was perceived; but at last, and in no small degree
owing to the teachings of Mahan, the people themselves took the matter in hand and insisted
that a great maritime empire should have adequate means of defending all that made its existence
possible.

[Footnote 47: Encyclopédie, 7th Jan. 1765, art. 'Thalassarchie.']

In forms differing in appearance, but identical in essentials, the efficacy of sea-power was
proved again in the American Secession war. If ever there were hostilities in which, to the
unobservant or short-sighted, naval operations might at first glance seem destined to count
for little, they were these. The sequel, however, made it clear that they constituted one of
the leading factors of the success of the victorious side. The belligerents, the Northern or
Federal States and the Southern or Confederate States, had a common land frontier of great
length. The capital of each section was within easy distance of this frontier, and the two
were not far apart. In wealth, population, and resources the Federals were enormously superior.
They alone possessed a navy, though at first it was a small one. The one advantage on the Confederate
side was the large proportion of military officers which belonged to it and their fine training
as soldiers. In physique as well as in morale the army of one side differed little from that
of the other; perhaps the Federal army was slightly superior in the first, and the Confederate,
as being recruited from a dominant white race, in the second. Outnumbered, less well equipped,
and more scantily supplied, the Confederates nevertheless kept up the war, with many brilliant
successes on land, for four years. Had they been able to maintain their trade with neutral
states they could have carried on the war longer, and--not improbably--have succeeded in the
end. The Federal navy, which was largely increased, took away all chance of this. It established
effective blockades of the Confederate ports, and severed their communications with the outside
world. Indispensable articles of equipment could not be obtained, and the armies, consequently,
became less and less able to cope with their abundantly furnished antagonists. By dominating
the rivers the Federals cut the Confederacy asunder; and by the power they possessed of moving
troops by sea at will, perplexed and harassed the defence, and facilitated the occupation of
important points. Meanwhile the Confederates could make no reply on the water except by capturing
merchant vessels, by which the contest was embittered, but the course of the war remained absolutely
unaffected. The great numbers of men under arms on shore, the terrific slaughter in many battles
of a war in which tactical ability, even in a moderate degree, was notably uncommon on both
sides, and the varying fortunes of the belligerents, made the land campaigns far more interesting
to the ordinary observer than the naval. It is not surprising, therefore, that peace had been
re-established for several years before the American people could be made to see the great
part taken by the navy in the restoration of the Union; and what the Americans had not seen
was hidden from the sight of other nations.

In several great wars in Europe waged since France and England made peace with Russia sea-power
manifested itself but little. In the Russo-Turkish war the great naval superiority of the Turks
in the Black Sea, where the Russians at the time had no fleet, governed the plans, if not the
course, of the campaigns. The water being denied to them, the Russians were compelled to execute
their plan of invading Turkey by land. An advance to the Bosphorus through the northern part
of Asia Minor was impracticable without help from a navy on the right flank. Consequently the
only route was a land one across the Danube and the Balkans. The advantages, though not fully
utilised, which the enforcement of this line of advance put into the hands of the Turks, and
the difficulties and losses which it caused the Russians, exhibited in a striking manner what
sea-power can effect even when its operation is scarcely observable.

This was more conspicuous in a later series of hostilities. The civil war in Chili between
Congressists and Balmacedists is specially interesting, because it throws into sharp relief
the predominant influence, when a non-maritime enemy is to be attacked, of a navy followed
up by an adequate land-force. At the beginning of the dispute the Balmacedists, or President's
party, had practically all the army, and the Congressists, or Opposition party, nearly all
the Chilian navy. Unable to remain in the principal province of the republic, and expelled
from the waters of Valparaiso by the Balmacedist garrisons of the forts--the only and doubtful
service which those works rendered to their own side--the Congressists went off with the ships
to the northern provinces, where they counted many adherents. There they formed an army, and
having money at command, and open sea communications, they were able to import equipment from
abroad, and eventually to transport their land-force, secured from molestation on the voyage
by the sea-power at their disposal, to the neighbourhood of Valparaiso, where it was landed
and triumphantly ended the campaign.

It will have been noticed that, in its main outlines, this story repeated that of many earlier
campaigns. It was itself repeated, as regards its general features, by the story of the war
between China and Japan in 1894-95. 'Every aspect of the war,' says Colomb, 'is interesting
to this country, as Japan is to China in a position similar to that which the British Islands
occupy to the European continent.'[48] It was additionally interesting because the sea-power
of Japan was a novelty. Though a novelty, it was well known by English naval men to be superior
in all essentials to that of China, a novelty itself. As is the rule when two belligerents
are contending for something beyond a purely maritime object, the final decision was to be
on land. Korea was the principal theatre of the land war; and, as far as access to it by sea
was concerned, the chief bases of the two sides were about the same distance from it. It was
possible for the Chinese to march there by land. The Japanese, coming from an island state,
were obliged to cross the water. It will be seen at once that not only the success of the Japanese
in the struggle, but also the possibility of its being carried on by them at all, depended
on sea-power. The Japanese proved themselves decisively superior at sea. Their navy effectually
cleared the way for one army which was landed in Korea, and for another which was landed in
the Chinese province of Shantung. The Chinese land-forces were defeated. The navy of japan,
being superior on the sea, was able to keep its sister service supplied or reinforced as required.
It was, however, not the navy, but the army, which finally frustrated the Chinese efforts at
defence, and really terminated the war. What the navy did was what, in accordance with the
limitations of sea-power, may be expected of a navy. It made the transport of the army across
the sea possible; and enabled it to do what of itself the army could not have done, viz. overcome
the last resistance of the enemy.

[Footnote 48: NavalWarfare, 3rd ed. p. 436.]

The issue of the Spanish-American war, at least as regards the mere defeat of Spain, was, perhaps,
a foregone conclusion. That Spain, even without a serious insurrection on her hands, was unequal
to the task of meeting so powerful an antagonist as the United States must have been evident
even to Spaniards. Be that as it may, an early collapse of the Spanish defence was not anticipated,
and however one-sided the war may have been seen to be, it furnished examples illustrating
rules as old as naval warfare. Mahan says of it that, 'while possessing, as every war does,
characteristics of its own differentiating it from others, nevertheless in its broad analogies
it falls into line with its predecessors, evidencing that unity of teaching which pervades
the art from its beginnings unto this day.'[49] The Spaniards were defeated by the superiority
of the American sea-power. 'A million of the best soldiers,' says Mahan, 'would have been powerless
in face of hostile control of the sea.' That control was obtained and kept by the United States
navy, thus permitting the unobstructed despatch of troops--and their subsequent reinforcement
and supply--to Spanish territory, which was finally conquered, not by the navy, but by the
army on shore. That it was the navy which made this final conquest possible happened, in this
case, to be made specially evident by the action of the United States Government, which stopped
a military expedition on the point of starting for Cuba until the sea was cleared of all Spanish
naval force worth attention.

[Footnote 49: LessonsoftheWarwithSpain, p. 16.]

The events of the long period which we have been considering will have shown how sea-power
operates, and what it effects. What is in it will have appeared from this narrative more clearly
than would have been possible from any mere definition. Like many other things, sea-power is
composed of several elements. To reach the highest degree of efficacy it should be based upon
a population naturally maritime, and on an ocean commerce naturally developed rather than artificially
enticed to extend itself. Its outward and visible sign is a navy, strong in the discipline,
skill, and courage of a numerous personnel habituated to the sea, in the number and quality
of its ships, in the excellence of its matériel, and in the efficiency, scale, security, and
geographical position of its arsenals and bases. History has demonstrated that sea-power thus
conditioned can gain any purely maritime object, can protect the trade and the communications
of a widely extended empire, and whilst so doing can ward off from its shores a formidable
invader. There are, however, limitations to be noted. Left to itself its operation is confined
to the water, or at any rate to the inner edge of a narrow zone of coast. It prepares the way
for the advance of an army, the work of which it is not intended, and is unable to perform.
Behind it, in the territory of which it guards the shores, there must be a land-force adjusted
in organisation, equipment, and numbers to the circumstances of the country. The possession
of a navy does not permit a sea-surrounded state to dispense with all fixed defences or fortification;
but it does render it unnecessary and indeed absurd that they should be abundant or gigantic.
The danger which always impends over the sea-power of any country is that, after being long
unused, it may lose touch of the sea. The revolution in the constructive arts during the last
half-century, which has also been a period of but little-interrupted naval peace, and the universal
adoption of mechanical appliances, both for ship-propulsion and for many minor services--mere
matériel being thereby raised in the general estimation far above really more important matters--makes
the danger mentioned more menacing in the present age than it has ever been before.

II

THE COMMAND OF THE SEA[50]

[Footnote 50: Written in 1899. (EncyclopoediaBritannica.)]

This phrase, a technical term of naval warfare, indicates a definite strategical condition.
The term has been substituted occasionally, but less frequently of late years, for the much
older 'Dominion of the sea' or 'Sovereignty of the sea,' a legal term expressing a claim, if
not a right. It has also been sometimes treated as though it were identical with the rhetorical
expression 'Empire of the sea.' Mahan, instead of it, uses the term 'Control of the sea,' which
has the merit of precision, and is not likely to be misunderstood or mixed up with a form of
words meaning something different. The expression 'Command of the sea,' however, in its proper
and strategic sense, is so firmly fixed in the language that it would be a hopeless task to
try to expel it; and as, no doubt, writers will continue to use it, it must be explained and
illustrated. Not only does it differ in meaning from 'Dominion or Sovereignty of the sea,'
it is not even truly derived therefrom, as can be briefly shown. 'It has become an uncontested
principle of modern international law that the sea, as a general rule, cannot be subjected
to appropriation.'[51] This, however, is quite modern. We ourselves did not admit the principle
till 1805; the Russians did not admit it till 1824; and the Americans, and then only tacitly,
not till 1894. Most European nations at some time or other have claimed and have exercised
rights over some part of the sea, though far outside the now well-recognised 'three miles'
limit.' Venice claimed the Adriatic, and exacted a heavy toll from vessels navigating its northern
waters. Genoa and France each claimed portions of the western Mediterranean. Denmark and Sweden
claimed to share the Baltic between them. Spain claimed dominion over the Pacific and the Gulf
of Mexico, and Portugal over the Indian Ocean and all the Atlantic south of Morocco.[52] The
claim which has made the greatest noise in the world is that once maintained by the kings of
England to the seas surrounding the British Isles. Like other institutions, the English sovereignty
of the sea was, and was admitted to be, beneficent for a long period. Then came the time when
it ought to have been abandoned as obsolete; but it was not, and so it led to war. The general
conviction of the maritime nations was that the Lord of the Sea would provide for the police
of the waters over which he exercised dominion. In rude ages when men, like the ancients, readily
'turned themselves to piracy,' this was of immense importance to trade; and, far from the right
of dominion being disputed by foreigners, it was insisted upon by them and declared to carry
with it certain duties. In 1299, not only English merchants, but also 'the maritime people
of Genoa, Catalonia, Spain, Germany, Zealand, Holland, Frisia, Denmark, Norway, and several
other places of the empire' declared that the kings of England had from time immemorial been
in 'peaceable possession of the sovereign lordship of the sea of England,' and had done what
was 'needful for the maintenance of peace, right, and equity between people of all sorts, whether
subjects of another kingdom or not, who pass through those seas.'[53] The English sovereignty
was not exercised as giving authority to exact toll. All that was demanded in return for keeping
the sea safe for peaceful traffic was a salute, enforced no doubt as a formal admission of
the right which permitted the (on the whole, at any rate) effective police of the waters to
be maintained. The Dutch in the seventeenth century objected to the demand for this salute.
It was insisted upon. War ensued; but in the end the Dutch acknowledged by solemn treaties
their obligation to render the salute. The time for exacting it, however, was really past.
S. R. Gardiner[54] maintains that though the 'question of the flag' was the occasion, it was
not the cause of the war. There was not much, if any, piracy in the English Channel which the
King of England was specially called upon to suppress, and if there had been the merchant vessels
of the age were generally able to defend themselves, while if they were not their governments
possessed force enough to give them the necessary protection. We gave up our claim to exact
the salute in 1805.

[Footnote 54: TheFirstDutchWar (Navy Records Society), 1899.]

The necessity of the foregoing short account of the 'Sovereignty or Dominion of the Seas' will
be apparent as soon as we come to the consideration of the first struggle, or rather series
of struggles, for the command of the sea. Gaining this was the result of our wars with the
Dutch in the seventeenth century. At the time of the first Dutch war, 1652-54, and probably
of the later wars also, a great many people, and especially seamen, believed that the conflict
was due to a determination on our part to retain, and on that of the Dutch to put an end to,
the English sovereignty or dominion. The obstinacy of the Dutch in objecting to pay the old-established
mark of respect to the English flag was quite reason enough in the eyes of most Englishmen,
and probably of most Dutchmen also, to justify hostilities which other reasons may have rendered
inevitable. The remarkable thing about the Dutch wars is that in reality what we gained was
the possibility of securing an absolute command of the sea. We came out of the struggle a great,
and in a fair way of becoming the greatest, naval power. It is this which prompted Vice-Admiral
P. H. Colomb to hold that there are various kinds of command, such as 'absolute or assured,'
'temporary,' 'with definite ulterior purpose,' &c. An explanation that would make all these
terms intelligible would be voluminous and is unnecessary here. It will be enough to say that
the absolute command--of attempts to gain which, as Colomb tells us, the Anglo-Dutch wars were
the most complete example--is nothing but an attribute of the nation whose power on the sea
is paramount. It exists and may be visible in time of peace. The command which, as said above,
expresses a definite strategical condition is existent only in time of war. It can easily be
seen that the former is essential to an empire like the British, the parts of which are bound
together by maritime communications. Inability to keep these communications open can have only
one result, viz. the loss of the parts with which communication cannot be maintained. Experience
of war as well as reason will have made it evident that inability to keep open sea-communications
cannot be limited to any single line, because the inability must be due either to incapacity
in the direction of hostilities or insufficiency of force. If we have not force enough to keep
open all the communications of our widely extended empire, or if--having force enough--we are
too foolish to employ it properly, we do not hold the command of the sea, and the empire must
fall if seriously attacked.

The strategic command of the sea in a particular war or campaign has equal concern for all
maritime belligerents. Before seeing what it is, it will be well to learn on high authority
what it is not. What the term really does imply is the power possessed from the first, or gained
during hostilities, by one belligerent of carrying out considerable over-sea expeditions at
will. In the Russian war just mentioned the allies had such overwhelmingly superior sea-power
that the Russians abandoned to them without a struggle the command of the sea; and the more
recent landing in South Africa, more than six thousand miles away, of a large British army
without even a threat of interruption on the voyage is another instance of unchallenged command.
In wars between great powers and also between secondary powers, if nearly equally matched,
this absence of challenge is rare. The rule is that the command of the sea has to be won after
hostilities begin. To win it the enemy's naval force must be neutralised. It must be driven
into his ports and there blockaded or 'masked,' and thus rendered virtually innocuous; or it
must be defeated and destroyed. The latter is the preferable, because the more effective, plan.
As was perceptible in the Spanish-American war of 1898, as long as one belligerent's fleet
is intact or at large, the other is reluctant to carry out any considerable expedition over-sea.
In fact, the command of the sea has not been secured whilst the enemy continues to have a 'fleet
in being.'[56]

[Footnote 55: InfluenceofSea-poweronHistory, 1890, p. 4.]

[Footnote 56: See ante, Sea-Power, p. 50.]

In 1782 a greatly superior Franco-Spanish fleet was covering the siege of Gibraltar. Had this
fleet succeeded in preventing the revictualling of the fortress the garrison would have been
starved into surrender. A British fleet under Lord Howe, though much weaker in numbers, had
not been defeated and was still at large. Howe, in spite of the odds against him, managed to
get his supply-ships in to the anchorage and to fight a partial action, in which he did the
allies as much damage as he received. There has never been a display of higher tactical skill
than this operation of Howe's, though, it may be said, he owes his fame much more to his less
meritorious performance on the first of June. The revictualling of Gibraltar surpassed even
Suffren's feat of the capture of Trincomalee in the same year. In 1798 the French, assuming
that a temporary superiority in the Mediterranean had given them a free hand on the water,
sent a great expedition to Egypt. Though the army which was carried succeeded in landing there,
the covering fleet was destroyed by Nelson at the Nile, and the army itself was eventually
forced to surrender. The French had not perceived that, except for a short time and for minor
operations, you cannot separate the command of the Mediterranean or of any particular area
of water from that of the sea in general. Local command of the sea may enable a belligerent
to make a hasty raid, seize a relatively insignificant port, or cut out a vessel; but it will
not ensure his being able to effect anything requiring considerable time for its execution,
or, in other words, anything likely to have an important influence on the course of the war.
If Great Britain has not naval force enough to retain command of the Mediterranean, she will
certainly not have force enough to retain command of the English Channel. It can be easily
shown why it should be so. In war danger comes less from conditions of locality than from the
enemy's power to hurt. Taking up a weak position when confronting an enemy may help him in
the exercise of his power, but it does not constitute it.[57] A maritime enemy's power to hurt
resides in his fleet. If that can be neutralised his power disappears. It is in the highest
degree improbable that this end can be attained by splitting up our own fleet into fragments
so as to have a part of it in nearly every quarter in which the enemy may try to do us mischief.
The most promising plan--as experience has often proved--is to meet the enemy, when he shows
himself, with a force sufficiently strong to defeat him. The proper station of the British
fleet in war should, accordingly, be the nearest possible point to the enemy's force. This
was the fundamental principle of Nelson's strategy, and it is as valid now as ever it was.
If we succeed in getting into close proximity to the hostile fleet with an adequate force of
our own, our foe cannot obtain command of the sea, or of any part of it, whether that part
be the Mediterranean or the English Channel, at any rate until he has defeated us. If he is
strong enough to defeat our fleet he obtains the command of the sea in general; and it is for
him to decide whether he shall show the effectiveness of that command in the Mediterranean
or in the Channel.

[Footnote 57: In his HistoryofScotland (1873). J. H. M. Burton, speaking of the Orkney and
Shetland isles in the Viking times, says (vol. i. p. 320): 'Those who occupied them were protected,
not so much by their own strength of position, as by the complete command over the North Sea
held by the fleets that found shelter in the fiords and firths.']

In the smaller operations of war temporary command of a particular area of water may suffice
for the success of an expedition, or at least will permit the execution of the preliminary
movements. When the main fleet of a country is at a distance--which it ought not to be except
with the object of nearing the opposing fleet--a small hostile expedition may slip across,
say the Channel, throw shells into a coast town or burn a fishing village, and get home again
unmolested. Its action would have no sort of influence on the course of the campaign, and would,
therefore, be useless. It would also most likely lead to reprisals; and, if this process were
repeated, the war would probably degenerate into the antiquated system of 'cross-raiding,'
discarded centuries ago, not at all for reasons of humanity, but because it became certain
that war could be more effectually waged in other ways. The nation in command of the sea may
resort to raiding to expedite the formal submission of an already defeated enemy, as Russia
did when at war with Sweden in 1719; but in such a case the other side cannot retaliate. Temporary
command of local waters will also permit of operations rather more considerable than mere raiding
attacks; but the duration of these operations must be adjusted to the time available. If the
duration of the temporary command is insufficient the operation must fail. It must fail even
if the earlier steps have been taken successfully. Temporary command of the Baltic in war might
enable a German force to occupy an Aland isle; but unless the temporary could be converted
into permanent command, Germany could make no use of the acquisition, which in the end would
revert as a matter of course to its former possessors. The command of the English Channel,
which Napoleon wished to obtain when maturing his invasion project, was only temporary. It
is possible that a reminiscence of what had happened in Egypt caused him to falter at the last;
and that, quite independently of the proceedings of Villeneuve, he hesitated to risk a second
battle of the Nile and the loss of a second army. It may have been this which justified his
later statement that he did not really mean to invade England. In any case, the English practice
of fixing the station of their fleet wherever that of the enemy's was, would have seriously
shortened the duration of his command of the Channel, even if it had allowed it to be won at
all. Moreover, attempts to carry out a great operation of war against time as well as against
the efforts of the enemy to prevent it are in the highest degree perilous.

In war the British Navy has three prominent duties to discharge. It has to protect our maritime
trade, to keep open the communications between the different parts of the empire, and to prevent
invasion. If we command the sea these duties will be discharged effectually. As long as we
command the sea the career of hostile cruisers sent to prey on our commerce will be precarious,
because command of the sea carries with it the necessity of possessing an ample cruiser force.
As long as the condition mentioned is satisfied our ocean communications will be kept open,
because an inferior enemy, who cannot obtain the command required, will be too much occupied
in seeing to his own safety to be able to interfere seriously with that of any part of our
empire. This being so, it is evident that the greater operation of invasion cannot be attempted,
much less carried to a successful termination, by the side which cannot make head against the
opposing fleet. Command of the sea is the indispensable preliminary condition of a successful
military expedition sent across the water. It enables the nation which possesses it to attack
its foes where it pleases and where they seem to be most vulnerable. At the same time it gives
to its possessor security against serious counter-attacks, and affords to his maritime commerce
the most efficient protection that can be devised. It is, in fact, the main object of naval
warfare.

III

WAR AND ITS CHIEF LESSONS[58]

[Footnote 58: Written in 1900. (NavalAnnual, 1901.)]

Had the expression 'real war' been introduced into the title of this chapter, its introduction
would have been justifiable. The sources--if not of our knowledge of combat, at least of the
views which are sure to prevail when we come to actual fighting--are to be found in two well-defined,
dissimilar, and widely separated areas. Within one are included the records of war; within
the other, remembrance of the exercises and manoeuvres of a time of peace. The future belligerent
will almost of a certainty have taken a practical part in the latter, whilst it is probable
that he will have had no personal experience of the former. The longer the time elapsed since
hostilities were in progress, the more probable and more general does this absence of experience
become. The fighting man--that is to say, the man set apart, paid, and trained so as to be
ready to fight when called upon--is of the same nature as the rest of his species. This is
a truism; but it is necessary to insist upon it, because professional, and especially professorial,
strategists and tacticians almost invariably ignore it. That which we have seen and know has
not only more, but very much more, influence upon the minds of nearly all of us than that of
which we have only heard, and, most likely, heard but imperfectly. The result is that, when
peace is interrupted and the fighting man--on both sea and land--is confronted with the problems
of practical belligerency, he brings to his attempts at their solution an intellectual equipment
drawn, not from knowledge of real war, but from the less trustworthy arsenal of the recollections
of his peace training.

When peace, especially a long peace, ends, the methods which it has introduced are the first
enemies which the organised defenders of a country have to overcome. There is plenty of evidence
to prove that--except, of course, in unequal conflicts between highly organised, civilised
states and savage or semi-barbarian tribes--success in war is directly proportionate to the
extent of the preliminary victory over the predominance of impressions derived from the habits
and exercises of an armed force during peace. That the cogency of this evidence is not invariably
recognised is to be attributed to insufficient attention to history and to disinclination to
apply its lessons properly. A primary object of the NavalAnnual--indeed, the chief reason for
its publication--being to assist in advancing the efficiency of the British Navy, its pages
are eminently the place for a review of the historical examples of the often-recurring inability
of systems established in peace to stand the test of war. Hostilities on land being more frequent,
and much more frequently written about, than those by sea, the history of the former as well
as of the latter must be examined. The two classes of warfare have much in common. The principles
of their strategy are identical; and, as regards some of their main features, so are those
of the tactics followed in each. Consequently the history of land warfare has its lessons for
those who desire to achieve success in warfare on the sea.

That this has often been lost sight of is largely due to a misapprehension of the meaning of
terms. The two words 'military' and 'army' have been given, in English, a narrower signification
than they ought, and than they used, to have. Both terms have been gradually restricted in
their use, and made to apply only to the land service. This has been unfortunate; because records
of occurrences and discussions, capable of imparting much valuable instruction to naval officers,
have been passed over by them as inapplicable to their own calling. It may have been noticed
that Captain Mahan uses the word 'military' in its right sense as indicating the members, and
the most important class of operations, of both land- and sea-forces. The French, through whom
the word has come to us from the Latin, use it in the same sense as Mahan. Unmilitaire is a
member of either a land army or a navy. The 'Naval and Military Intelligence' of the English
press is given under the heading 'Nouvelles Militaires' in the French. Our word 'army' also
came to us direct from the French, who still apply it equally to both services--arméede terre,arméedemer.
It is a participle, and means 'armed,' the word 'force' being understood. The kindred words
armada in Spanish and Portuguese, and armata in Italian--equally derived from the Latin--are
used to indicate a fleet or navy, another name being given to a land army. The word 'army'
was generally applied to a fleet in former days by the English, as will be seen on reference
to the Navy Records Society's volumes on the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

This short etymological discussion is not inappropriate here, for it shows why we should not
neglect authorities on the history and conduct of war merely because they do not state specially
that they are dealing with the naval branch of it.

A very slight knowledge of history is quite enough to make us acquainted with the frequent
recurrence of defeats and disasters inflicted on armed forces by antagonists whose power to
do so had not been previously suspected. It has been the same on the sea as on the land, though--owing
to more copious records--we may have a larger list of events on the latter. It will not be
denied that it is of immense importance to us to inquire how this happened, and ascertain how--for
the future--it may be rendered highly improbable in our own case. A brief enumeration of the
more striking instances will make it plain that the events in question have been confined to
no particular age and to no particular country.

It may be said that the more elaborately organised and trained in peace time an armed force
happened to be, the more unexpected always, and generally the more disastrous, was its downfall.
Examples of this are to be found in the earliest campaigns of which we have anything like detailed
accounts, and they continue to reappear down to very recent times. In the elaborate nature
of its organisation and training there probably never has been an army surpassing that led
by Xerxes into Greece twenty-four centuries ago. Something like eight years had been devoted
to its preparation. The minute account of its review by Xerxes on the shores of the Hellespont
proves that, however inefficient the semi-civilised contingents accompanying it may have been,
the regular Persian army appeared, in discipline, equipment, and drill, to have come up to
the highest standard of the most intense 'pipeclay' epoch. In numbers alone its superiority
was considerable to the last, and down to the very eve of Platæa its commander openly displayed
his contempt for his enemy. Yet no defeat could be more complete than that suffered by the
Persians at the hands of their despised antagonists.

As if to establish beyond dispute the identity of governing conditions in both land and maritime
wars, the next very conspicuous disappointment of an elaborately organised force was that of
the Athenian fleet at Syracuse. At the time Athens, without question, stood at the head of
the naval world: her empire was in the truest sense the product of sea-power. Her navy, whilst
unequalled in size, might claim, without excessive exaggeration, to be invincible. The great
armament which the Athenians despatched to Sicily seemed, in numbers alone, capable of triumphing
over all resistance. If the Athenian navy had already met with some explicable mishaps, it
looked back with complacent confidence on the glorious achievements of more than half a century
previously. It had enjoyed many years of what was so nearly a maritime peace that its principal
exploits had been the subjection of states weak to insignificance on the sea as compared with
imperial Athens. Profuse expenditure on its maintenance; the 'continued practice' of which
Pericles boasted, the peace manoeuvres of a remote past; skilfully designed equipment; and
the memory of past glories;--all these did not avail to save it from defeat at the hands of
an enemy who only began to organise a fleet when the Athenians had invaded his coast waters.

Ideal perfection as a regular army has never been so nearly reached as by that of Sparta. The
Spartan spent his life in the barrack and the mess-room; his amusements were the exercises
of the parade ground. For many generations a Spartan force had never been defeated in a pitched
battle. We have had, in modern times, some instances of a hectoring soldiery arrogantly prancing
amongst populations whose official defenders it had defeated in battle; but nonesuch could
vie with the Spartans in the sublimity of their military self-esteem. Overweening confidence
in the prowess of her army led Sparta to trample with ruthless disdain on the rights of others.
The iniquitous attack on Thebes, a state thought incapable of effectual resentment, was avenged
by the defeat of Leuctra, which announced the end of the political supremacy and the military
predominance of Sparta.

In the series of struggles with Carthage which resulted in putting Rome in a position enabling
her eventually to win the dominion of the ancient world, the issue was to be decided on the
water. Carthage was essentially a maritime state. The foundation of the city was effected by
a maritime expedition; its dominions lay on the neighbouring coast or in regions to which the
Carthaginians could penetrate only by traversing the sea. To Carthage her fleet was 'all in
all': her navy, supported by large revenues and continuously maintained, was more of a 'regular'
force than any modern navy before the second half of the seventeenth century. The Romans were
almost without a fleet, and when they formed one the undertaking was ridiculed by the Carthaginians
with an unconcealed assumption of superiority. The defeat of the latter off Mylæ, the first
of several, came as a great surprise to them, and, as we can see now, indicated the eventual
ruin of their city.

We are so familiar with stories of the luxury and corruption of the Romans during the decline
of the empire that we are likely to forget that the decline went on for centuries, and that
their armed forces, however recruited, presented over and over again abundant signs of physical
courage and vigour. The victory of Stilicho over Alaric at Pollentia has been aptly paralleled
with that of Marius over the Cimbri. This was by no means the only achievement of the Roman
army of the decadence. A century and a quarter later--when the Empire of the West had fallen
and the general decline had made further progress--Belisarius conducted successful campaigns
in Persia, in North Africa, in Sicily, and in Italy. The mere list of countries shows that
the mobility and endurance of the Roman forces during a period in which little creditable is
generally looked for were not inferior to their discipline and courage. Yet they met with disastrous
defeat after all, and at the hands of races which they had more than once proved themselves
capable of withstanding. It could not have been because the later Roman equipment was inferior,
the organisation less elaborate, or the training less careful than those of their barbarian
enemies.

Though it is held by some in these days that the naval power of Spain in the latter part of
the sixteenth century was not really formidable, that does not appear to have been the opinion
of contemporaries, whether Spaniards or otherwise. Some English seamen of the time did, indeed,
declare their conviction that Philip the Second's navy was not so much to be feared as many
of their fellow-countrymen thought; but, in the public opinion of the age, Spain was the greatest,
or indeed the one great, naval state. She possessed a more systematically organised navy than
any other country having the ocean for a field of action had then, or till long afterwards.
Even Genoa and Venice, whose operations, moreover, were restricted to Mediterranean waters,
could not have been served by more finished specimens of the naval officer and the man-of-war's
man of the time than a large proportion of the military personnel of the regular Spanish fleet.
As Basques, Castilians, Catalans, or Aragonese, or all combined, the crews of Spanish fighting
ships could look back upon a glorious past. It was no wonder that, by common consent of those
who manned it, the title of 'Invincible' was informally conferred upon the Armada which, in
1588, sailed for the English Channel. How it fared is a matter of common knowledge. No one
could have been more surprised at the result than the gallant officers who led its squadrons.

Spain furnishes another instance of the unexpected overthrow of a military body to which long
cohesion and precise organisation were believed to have secured invincibility. The Spanish
was considered the 'most redoubtable infantry in Europe' till its unexpected defeat at Rocroi.
The effects of this defeat were far-reaching. Notwithstanding the bravery of her sons, which
has never been open to question, and, in fact, has always been conspicuous, the military superiority
of Spain was broken beyond repair.

In the history of other countries are to be found examples equally instructive. The defeats
of Almansa, Brihuega, and Villaviciosa were nearly contemporary with the victories of Blenheim
and Ramillies; and the thousands of British troops compelled to lay down their arms at the
first named belonged to the same service as their fellow-countrymen who so often marched to
victory under Marlborough. A striking example of the disappointment which lies in wait for
military self-satisfaction was furnished by the defeat of Soubise at Rossbach by Frederick
the Great. Before the action the French had ostentatiously shown their contempt for their opponent.

The service which gloried in the exploits of Anson and of Hawke discerned the approach of the
Seven Years' war without misgiving; and the ferocity shown in the treatment of Byng enables
us now to measure the surprise caused by the result of the action off Minorca. There were further
surprises in store for the English Navy. At the end of the Seven Years' war its reputation
for invincibility was generally established. Few, perhaps none, ventured to doubt that, if
there were anything like equality between the opposing forces, a meeting between the French
and the British fleets could have but one result--viz. the decisive victory of the latter.
Experience in the English Channel, on the other side of the Atlantic, and in the Bay of Bengal--during
the war of American Independence--roughly upset this flattering anticipation. Yet, in the end,
the British Navy came out the unquestioned victor in the struggle: which proves the excellence
of its quality. After every allowance is made for the incapacity of the Government, we must
suspect that there was something else which so often frustrated the efforts of such a formidable
force as the British Navy of the day must essentially have been. On land the surprises were
even more mortifying; and it is no exaggeration to say that, a year before it occurred, such
an event as the surrender of Burgoyne's army to an imperfectly organised and trained body of
provincials would have seemed impossible.

The army which Frederick the Great bequeathed to Prussia was universally regarded as the model
of efficiency. Its methods were copied in other countries, and foreign officers desiring to
excel in their profession made pilgrimages to Berlin and Potsdam to drink of the stream of
military knowledge at its source. When it came in contact with the tumultuous array of revolutionary
France, the performances of the force that preserved the tradition of the great Frederick were
disappointingly wanting in brilliancy. A few years later it suffered an overwhelming disaster.
The Prussian defeat at Jena was serious as a military event; its political effects were of
the utmost importance. Yet many who were involved in that disaster took, later on, an effective
part in the expulsion of the conquerors from their country, and in settling the history of
Europe for nearly half a century at Waterloo.

The brilliancy of the exploits of Wellington and the British army in Portugal and Spain has
thrown into comparative obscurity that part of the Peninsular war which was waged for years
by the French against the Spaniards. Spain, distracted by palace intrigues and political faction,
with the flower of her troops in a distant comer of Europe, and several of her most important
fortresses in the hands of her assailant, seemed destined to fall an easy and a speedy prey
to the foremost military power in the world. The attitude of the invaders made it evident that
they believed themselves to be marching to certain victory. Even the British soldiers--of whom
there were never many more than 50,000 in the Peninsula, and for some years not half that number--were
disdained until they had been encountered. The French arms met with disappointment after disappointment.
On one occasion a whole French army, over 18,000 strong, surrendered to a Spanish force, and
became prisoners of war. Before the struggle closed there were six marshals of France with
nearly 400,000 troops in the Peninsula. The great efforts which these figures indicate were
unsuccessful, and the intruders were driven from the country. Yet they were the comrades of
the victors of Austerlitz, of Jena, and of Wagram, and part of that mighty organisation which
had planted its victorious standards in Berlin and Vienna, held down Prussia like a conquered
province, and shattered into fragments the holy Roman Empire.

In 1812 the British Navy was at the zenith of its glory. It had not only defeated all its opponents;
it had also swept the seas of the fleets of the historic maritime powers--of Spain, of France,
which had absorbed the Italian maritime states, of the Netherlands, of Denmark. Warfare, nearly
continuous for eighteen, and uninterrupted for nine years, had transformed the British Navy
into an organisation more nearly resembling a permanently maintained force than it had been
throughout its previous history. Its long employment in serious hostilities had saved it from
some of the failings which the narrow spirit inherent in a close profession is only too sure
to foster. It had, however, a confidence--not unjustified by its previous exploits--in its
own invincibility. This confidence did not diminish, and was not less ostentatiously exhibited,
as its great achievements receded more and more into the past. The new enemy who now appeared
on the farther side of the Atlantic was not considered formidable. In the British Navy there
were 145,000 men. In the United States Navy the number of officers, seamen, and marines available
for ocean service was less than 4500--an insignificant numerical addition to the enemies with
whom we were already contending. The subsequent and rapid increase in the American personnel
to 18,000 shows the small extent to which it could be considered a 'regular' force, its permanent
nucleus being overwhelmingly outnumbered by the hastily enrolled additions. Our defeats in
the war of 1812 have been greatly exaggerated; but, all the same, they did constitute rebuffs
to our naval self-esteem which were highly significant in themselves, and deserve deep attention.
Rebuffs of the kind were not confined to the sea service, and at New Orleans our army, which
numbered in its ranks soldiers of Busaco, Fuentes de Onoro, and Salamanca, met with a serious
defeat.

When the Austro-Prussian war broke out in 1866, the Austrian commander-in-chief, General Benedek,
published an order, probably still in the remembrance of many, which officially declared the
contempt for the enemy felt in the Imperial army. Even those who perceived that the Prussian
forces were not fit subjects of contempt counted with confidence on the victory of the Austrians.
Yet the latter never gained a considerable success in their combats with the Prussians; and
within a few weeks from the beginning of hostilities the general who had assumed such a lofty
tone of superiority in speaking of his foes had to implore his sovereign to make peace to avoid
further disasters.

At the beginning of the Franco-German war of 1870, the widespread anticipation of French victories
was clearly shown by the unanimity with which the journalists of various nationalities illustrated
their papers with maps giving the country between the French frontier and Berlin, and omitting
the part of France extending to Paris. In less than five weeks from the opening of hostilities
events had made it certain that a map of the country to the eastward of Lorraine would be practically
useless to a student of the campaign, unless it were to follow the route of the hundreds of
thousands of French soldiers who were conveyed to Germany as prisoners of war.

It is to be specially noted that in the above enumeration only contests in which the result
was unexpected--unexpected not only by the beaten side but also by impartial observers--have
been specified. In all wars one side or the other is defeated; and it has not been attempted
to give a general résumé of the history of war. The object has been to show the frequency--in
all ages and in all circumstances of systematic, as distinguished from savage, warfare--of
the defeat of the force which by general consent was regarded as certain to win. Now it is
obvious that a result so frequently reappearing must have a distinct cause, which is well worth
trying to find out. Discovery of the cause may enable us to remove it in the future, and thus
prevent results which are likely to be all the more disastrous because they have not been foreseen.

Professional military writers--an expression which, as before explained, includes naval--do
not help us much in the prosecution of the search which is so eminently desirable. As a rule,
they have contrived rather to hide than to bring to light the object sought for. It would be
doing them injustice to assume that this has been done with deliberate intention. It is much
more likely due to professional bias, which exercises over the minds of members of definitely
limited professions incessant and potent domination. When alluding to occurrences included
in the enumeration given above, they exhibit signs of a resolve to defend their profession
against possible imputations of inefficiency, much more than a desire to get to the root of
the matter. This explains the unremitting eagerness of military writers to extol the special
qualities developed by long-continued service habits and methods. They are always apprehensive
of the possibility of credit being given to fighting bodies more loosely organised and less
precisely trained in peace time than the body to which they themselves belong.

This sensitiveness as to the merits of their particular profession, and impatience of even
indirect criticism, are unnecessary. There is nothing in the history of war to show that an
untrained force is better than a trained force. On the contrary, all historical evidence is
on the other side. In quite as many instances as are presented by the opposite, the forces
which put an unexpected end to the military supremacy long possessed by their antagonists were
themselves, in the strictest sense of the word, 'regulars.' The Thebans whom Epaminondas led
to victory over the Spartans at Leuctra no more resembled a hasty levy of armed peasants or
men imperfectly trained as soldiers than did Napoleon's army which overthrew the Prussians
at Jena, or the Germans who defeated the French at Gravelotte and Sedan. Nothing could have
been less like an 'irregular' force than the fleet with which La Galissonnière beat Byng off
Minorca, or the French fleets which, in the war of American Independence, so often disappointed
the hopes of the British. The records of war on land and by sea--especially the extracts from
them included in the enumeration already given--lend no support to the silly suggestion that
efficient defence can be provided for a country by 'an untrained man with a rifle behind a
hedge.' The truth is that it was not the absence of organisation or training on one side which
enabled it to defeat the other. If the beaten side had been elaborately organised and carefully
trained, there must have been something bad in its organisation or its methods.

Now this 'something bad,' this defect--wherever it has disclosed itself--has been enough to
neutralise the most splendid courage and the most unselfish devotion. It has been seen that
armies and navies the valour of which has never been questioned have been defeated by antagonists
sometimes as highly organised as they were, and sometimes much less so. This ought to put us
on the track of the cause which has produced an effect so little anticipated. A 'regular' permanently
embodied or maintained service of fighting men is always likely to develop a spirit of intense
professional self-satisfaction. The more highly organised it is, and the more sharply its official
frontiers are defined, the more intense is this spirit likely to become. A 'close' service
of the kind grows restive at outside criticism, and yields more and more to the conviction
that no advance in efficiency is possible unless it be the result of suggestions emanating
from its own ranks. Its view of things becomes narrower and narrower, whereas efficiency in
war demands the very widest view. Ignorant critics call the spirit thus engendered 'professional
conservatism'; the fact being that change is not objected to--is even welcomed, however frequent
it may be, provided only that it is suggested from inside. An immediate result is 'unreality
and formalism of peace training'--to quote a recent thoughtful military critic.

As the formalism becomes more pronounced, so the unreality increases. The proposer or introducer
of a system of organisation of training or of exercises is often, perhaps usually, capable
of distinguishing between the true and the false, the real and the unreal. His successors,
the men who continue the execution of his plans, can hardly bring to their work the open mind
possessed by the originator; they cannot escape from the influence of the methods which have
been provided for them ready made, and which they are incessantly engaged in practising. This
is not a peculiarity of the military profession in either branch--it extends to nearly every
calling; but in the profession specified, which is a service rather than a freely exercised
profession, it is more prominent. Human thought always has a tendency to run in grooves, and
in military institutions the grooves are purposely made deep, and departure from them rigorously
forbidden. All exercises, even those designed to have the widest scope, tend to become mere
drill. Each performance produces, and bequeaths for use on the next occasion, a set of customary
methods of execution which are readily adopted by the subsequent performers. There grows up
in time a kind of body of customary law governing the execution of peace operations--the principles
being peace-operation principles wholly and solely--which law few dare to disobey, and which
eventually obtains the sanction of official written regulations. As Scharnhorst, quoted by
Baron von der Goltz, said, 'We have begun to place the art of war higher than military virtues.'
The eminent authority who thus expressed himself wrote the words before the great catastrophe
of Jena; and, with prophetic insight sharpened by his fear of the menacing tendency of peace-training
formalism and unreality, added his conviction that 'this has been the ruin of nations from
time immemorial.'

Independently of the evidence of history already adduced, it would be reasonable to conclude
that the tendency is strengthened and made more menacing when the service in which it prevails
becomes more highly specialised. If custom and regulation leave little freedom of action to
the individual members of an armed force, the difficulty--sure to be experienced by them--of
shaking themselves clear of their fetters when the need for doing so arises is increased. To
realise--when peace is broken--the practical conditions of war demands an effort of which the
unfettered intelligence alone seems capable. The great majority of successful leaders in war
on both elements have not been considerably, or at all, superior in intellectual acuteness
to numbers of their fellows; but they have had strength of character, and their minds were
not squeezed in a mould into a commonplace and uniform pattern.

The 'canker of a long peace,' during recent years at any rate, is not manifested in disuse
of arms, but in mistaken methods. For a quarter of a century the civilised world has tended
more and more to become a drill-ground, but the spirit dominating it has been that of the pedant.
There has been more exercise and less reality. The training, especially of officers, becomes
increasingly scholastic. This, and the deterioration consequent on it, are not merely modern
phenomena. They appear in all ages. 'The Sword of the Saracens,' says Gibbon, 'became less
formidable when their youth was drawn from the camp to the college.' The essence of pedantry
is want of originality. It is nourished on imitation. For the pedant to imitate is enough of
itself; to him the suitability of the model is immaterial. Thus military bodies have been ruined
by mimicry of foreign arrangements quite inapplicable to the conditions of the mimics' country.
More than twenty years ago Sir Henry Maine, speaking of the war of American Independence, said,
'Next to their stubborn valour, the chief secret of the colonists' success was the incapacity
of the English generals, trained in the stiff Prussian system soon to perish at Jena, to adapt
themselves to new conditions of warfare.' He pointed out that the effect of this uncritical
imitation of what was foreign was again experienced by men 'full of admiration of a newer German
system.' We may not be able to explain what it is, but, all the same, there does exist something
which we call national characteristics. The aim of all training should be to utilise these
to the full, not to ignore them. The naval methods of a continental state with relatively small
oceanic interests, or with but a brief experience of securing these, cannot be very applicable
to a great maritime state whose chief interests have been on the seas for many years.

How is all this applicable to the ultimate efficiency of the British Navy? It may be allowed
that there is a good deal of truth in what has been written above; but it may be said that
considerations sententiously presented cannot claim to have much practical value so long as
they are absolute and unapplied. The statement cannot be disputed. It is unquestionably necessary
to make the application. The changes in naval matériel, so often spoken of, introduced within
the last fifty years have been rivalled by the changes in the composition of the British Navy.
The human element remains in original individual character exactly the same as it always was;
but there has been a great change in the opportunities and facilities offered for the development
of the faculties most desired in men-of-war's men. All reform--using the word in its true sense
of alteration, and not in its strained sense of improvement--has been in the direction of securing
perfect uniformity. If we take the particular directly suggested by the word just used, we
may remember, almost with astonishment, that there was no British naval uniform for anyone
below the rank of officer till after 1860. Now, at every inspection, much time is taken up
in ascertaining if the narrow tape embroidery on a frock collar is of the regulation width,
and if the rows of tape are the proper distance apart. The diameter of a cloth cap is officially
defined; and any departure from the regulation number of inches (and fractions of an inch)
is as sure of involving punishment as insubordination.

It is the same in greater things. Till 1853--in which year the change came into force--there
was no permanent British naval service except the commissioned and warrant officers. Not till
several years later did the new 'continuous service' men equal half of the bluejacket aggregate.
Now, every bluejacket proper serves continuously, and has been in the navy since boyhood. The
training of the boys is made uniform. No member of the ship's company--except a domestic--is
now allowed to set foot on board a sea-going ship till he has been put through a training course
which is exactly like that through which every other member of his class passes. Even during
the comparatively brief period in which young officers entered the navy by joining the college
at Portsmouth, it was only the minority who received the special academic training. Till the
establishment of the Illustrious training school in 1855, the great majority of officers joined
their first ship as individuals from a variety of different and quite independent quarters.
Now, every one of them has, as a preliminary condition, to spend a certain time--the same for
all--in a school. Till a much later period, every engineer entered separately. Now, passing
through a training establishment is obligatory for engineers also.

Within the service there has been repeated formation of distinct branches or 'schools,' such
as the further specialised specialist gunnery and torpedo sections. It was not till 1860 that
uniform watch bills, quarter bills, and station bills were introduced, and not till later that
their general adoption was made compulsory. Up to that time the internal organisation and discipline
of a ship depended on her own officers, it being supposed that capacity to command a ship implied,
at least, capacity to distribute and train her crew. The result was a larger scope than is
now thought permissible for individual capability. However short-lived some particular drill
or exercise may be, however soon it is superseded by another, as long as it lasts the strictest
conformity to it is rigorously enforced. Even the number of times that an exercise has to be
performed, difference in class of ship or in the nature of the service on which she is employed
notwithstanding, is authoritatively laid down. Still more noteworthy, though much less often
spoken of than the change in matériel, has been the progress of the navy towards centralisation.
Naval duties are now formulated at a desk on shore, and the mode of carrying them out notified
to the service in print. All this would have been quite as astonishing to the contemporaries
of Nelson or of Exmouth and Codrington as the aspect of a battleship or of a 12-inch breech-loading
gun.

Let it be clearly understood that none of these things has been mentioned with the intention
of criticising them either favourably or unfavourably. They have been cited in order that it
may be seen that the change in naval affairs is by no means one in matériel only, and that
the transformation in other matters has been stupendous and revolutionary beyond all previous
experience. It follows inevitably from this that we shall wage war in future under conditions
dissimilar from any hitherto known. In this very fact there lies the making of a great surprise.
It will have appeared from the historical statement given above how serious a surprise sometimes
turns out to be. Its consequences, always significant, are not unfrequently far-reaching. The
question of practical moment is: How are we to guard ourselves against such a surprise? To
this a satisfactory answer can be given. It might be summarised in the admonitions: abolish
over-centralisation; give proper scope to individual capacity and initiative; avoid professional
self-sufficiency.

When closely looked at, it is one of the strangest manifestations of the spirit of modern navies
that, though the issues of land warfare are rarely thought instructive, the peace methods of
land forces are extensively and eagerly copied by the sea-service. The exercises of the parade
ground and the barrack square are taken over readily, and so are the parade ground and the
barrack square themselves. This may be right. The point is that it is novel, and that a navy
into the training of which the innovation has entered must differ considerably from one that
was without it and found no need of it during a long course of serious wars. At any rate, no
one will deny that parade-ground evolutions and barrack-square drill expressly aim at the elimination
of individuality, or just the quality to the possession of which we owe the phenomenon called,
in vulgar speech, the 'handy man.' Habits and sentiments based on a great tradition, and the
faculties developed by them, are not killed all at once; but innovation in the end annihilates
them, and their not having yet entirely disappeared gives no ground for doubting their eventual,
and even near, extinction. The aptitudes still universally most prized in the seaman were produced
and nourished by practices and under conditions no longer allowed to prevail. Should we lose
those aptitudes, are we likely to reach the position in war gained by our predecessors?

For the British Empire the matter is vital: success in maritime war, decisive and overwhelming,
is indispensable to our existence. We have to consider the desirability of 'taking stock' of
our moral, as well as of our material, naval equipment: to ascertain where the accumulated
effect of repeated innovations has carried us. The mere fact of completing the investigation
will help us to rate at their true value the changes which have been introduced; will show
us what to retain, what to reject, and what to substitute. There is no essential vagueness
in these allusions. If they seem vague, it is because the moment for particularising has not
yet come. The public opinion of the navy must first be turned in the right direction. It must
be led to question the soundness of the basis on which many present methods rest. Having once
begun to do this, we shall find no difficulty in settling, in detail and with precision, what
the true elements of naval efficiency are.

IV[59]

THE HISTORICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NAVY AND THE MERCHANT SERVICE

[Footnote 59: Written in 1898. (TheTimes.)]

The regret, often expressed, that the crews of British merchant ships now include a large proportion
of foreigners, is founded chiefly on the apprehension that a well-tested and hitherto secure
recruiting ground for the navy is likely to be closed. It has been stated repeatedly, and the
statement has been generally accepted without question, that in former days, when a great expansion
of our fleet was forced on us by the near approach of danger, we relied upon the ample resources
of our merchant service to complete the manning of our ships of war, even in a short time,
and that the demands of the navy upon the former were always satisfied. It is assumed that
compliance with those demands was as a rule not voluntary, but was enforced by the press-gang.
The resources, it is said, existed and were within reach, and the method employed in drawing
upon them was a detail of comparatively minor importance; our merchant ships were manned by
native-born British seamen, of whom tens of thousands were always at hand, so that if volunteers
were not forthcoming the number wanted could be 'pressed' into the Royal service. It is lamented
that at the present day the condition of affairs is different, that the presence in it of a
large number of foreigners forbids us to regard with any confidence the merchant service as
an adequate naval recruiting ground in the event of war, even though we are ready to substitute
for the system of 'impressment'--which is now considered both undesirable and impossible--rewards
likely to attract volunteers. The importance of the subject need not be dwelt upon. The necessity
to a maritime state of a powerful navy, including abundant resources for manning it, is now
no more disputed than the law of gravitation. If the proportion of foreigners in our merchant
service is too high it is certainly deplorable; and if, being already too high, that proportion
is rising, an early remedy is urgently needed. I do not propose to speak here of that matter,
which is grave enough to require separate treatment.

My object is to present the results of an inquiry into the history of the relations between
the navy and the merchant service, from which will appear to what extent the latter helped
in bringing the former up to a war footing, how far its assistance was affected by the presence
in it of any foreign element, and in what way impressment ensured or expedited the rendering
of the assistance. The inquiry has necessarily been largely statistical; consequently the results
will often be given in a statistical form. This has the great advantage of removing the conclusions
arrived at from the domain of mere opinion into that of admitted fact. The statistics used
are those which have not been, and are not likely to be, questioned. It is desirable that this
should be understood, because official figures have not always commanded universal assent.
Lord Brougham, speaking in the House of Lords in 1849 of tables issued by the Board of Trade,
said that a lively impression prevailed 'that they could prove anything and everything'; and
in connection with them he adopted some unnamed person's remark, 'Give me half an hour and
the run of the multiplication table and I'll engage to payoff the National Debt.' In this inquiry
there has been no occasion to use figures relating to the time of Lord Brougham's observations.
We will take the last three great maritime wars in which our country has been engaged. These
were: the war of American Independence, the war with Revolutionary France to the Peace of Amiens,
and the war with Napoleon. The period covered by these three contests roughly corresponds to
the last quarter of the eighteenth and the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century. In
each of the three wars there was a sudden and large addition to the number of seamen in the
navy; and in each there were considerable annual increases as the struggle continued. It must
be understood that we shall deal with the case of seamen only; the figures, which also were
large, relating to the marines not being included in our survey because it has never been contended
that their corps looked to the merchant service for any appreciable proportion of its recruits.
In taking note of the increase of seamen voted for any year it will be necessary to make allowance
also for the 'waste' of the previous year. The waste, even in the latter part of the last century,
was large. Commander Robinson, in his valuable work, 'The British Fleet,' gives details showing
that the waste during the Seven Years' war was so great as to be truly shocking. In 1895 Lord
Brassey (NavalAnnual) allowed for the personnel of the navy, even in these days of peace and
advanced sanitary science, a yearly waste of 5 per cent., a percentage which is, I expect,
rather lower than that officially accepted. We may take it as certain that, during the three
serious wars above named, the annual waste was never less than 6 per cent. This is, perhaps,
to put it too low; but it is better to understate the case than to appear to exaggerate it.
The recruiting demand, therefore, for a year of increased armament will be the sum of the increase
in men plus the waste on the previous year's numbers.

The capacity of the British merchant service to supply what was demanded would, of course,
be all the greater the smaller the number of foreigners it contained in its ranks. This is
not only generally admitted at the present day; it is also frequently pointed out when it is
asserted that the conditions now are less favourable than they were owing to a recent influx
of foreign seamen. The fact, however, is that there were foreigners on board British merchant
ships, and, it would seem, in considerable numbers, long before even the war of American Independence.
By 13 George II, c. 3, foreigners, not exceeding three-fourths of the crew, were permitted
in British vessels, 'and in two years to be naturalised.' By 13 George II, c. 17, exemption
from impressment was granted to 'every person, being a foreigner, who shall serve in any merchant
ship, or other trading vessel or privateer belonging to a subject of the Crown of Great Britain.'
The Acts quoted were passed about the time of the 'Jenkins' Ear War' and the war of the Austrian
Succession; but the fact that foreigners were allowed to form the majority of a British vessel's
crew is worthy of notice. The effect and, probably, the object of this legislation were not
so much to permit foreign seamen to enter our merchant service as to permit the number of those
already there to be increased. It was in 1759 that Lord, then Commander, Duncan reported that
the crew of the hired merchant ship Royal Exchange consisted 'to a large extent of boys and
foreigners, many of whom could not speak English.' In 1770 by 11 George III, c. 3, merchant
ships were allowed to have three-fourths of their crews foreigners till the 1st February 1772.
Acts permitting the same proportion of foreign seamen and extending the time were passed in
1776, 1778, 1779, 1780, 1781, and 1782. A similar Act was passed in 1792. It was in contemplation
to reduce the foreign proportion, after the war, to one-fourth. In 1794 it was enacted (34
George III, c. 68), 'for the encouragement of British seamen,' that after the expiration of
six months from the conclusion of the war, vessels in the foreign, as distinguished from the
coasting, trade were to have their commanders and three-fourths of their crews British subjects.
From the wording of the Act it seems to have been taken for granted that the proportion of
three-fourths bonafide British-born seamen was not likely to be generally exceeded. It will
have been observed that in all the legislation mentioned, from the time of George II downwards,
it was assumed as a matter of course that there were foreign seamen on board our merchant vessels.
The United States citizens in the British Navy, about whom there was so much discussion on
the eve of the war of 1812, came principally from our own merchant service, and not direct
from the American. It is remarkable that, until a recent date, the presence of foreigners in
British vessels, even in time of peace, was not loudly or generally complained of. Mr. W. S.
Lindsay, writing in 1876, stated that the throwing open the coasting trade in 1855 had 'neither
increased on the average the number of foreigners we had hitherto been allowed to employ in
our ships, nor deteriorated the number and quality of British seamen.' I have brought forward
enough evidence to show that, as far as the merchant service was the proper recruiting ground
for the British Navy, it was not one which was devoid of a considerable foreign element.

We may, nevertheless, feel certain that that element never amounted to, and indeed never nearly
approached, three-fourths of the whole number of men employed in our 'foreign-going' vessels.
For this, between 50,000 and 60,000 men would have been required, at least in the last of the
three wars above mentioned. If all the foreign mercantile marines at the present day, when
nearly all have been so largely increased, were to combine, they could not furnish the number
required after their own wants had been satisfied. During the period under review some of the
leading commercial nations were at war with us; so that few, if any, seamen could have come
to us from them. Our custom-house statistics indicate an increase in the shipping trade of
the neutral nations sufficient to have rendered it impossible for them to spare us any much
larger number of seamen. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to resist the conclusion that
during the wars the composition of our merchant service remained nearly what it was during
peace. It contained a far from insignificant proportion of foreigners; and that proportion
was augmented, though by no means enormously, whilst war was going on. This leads us to the
further conclusion that, if our merchant service supplied the navy with many men, it could
recover only a small part of the number from foreign countries. In fact, any that it could
give it had to replace from our own population almost exclusively.

The question now to be considered is, What was the capacity of the merchant service for supplying
the demands of the navy? In the year 1770 the number of seamen voted for the navy was 11,713.
Owing to a fear of a difficulty with Spain about the Falkland Islands, the number for the following
year was suddenly raised to 31,927. Consequently, the increase was 20,214, which, added to
the 'waste' on the previous year, made the whole naval demand about 21,000. We have not got
statistics of the seamen of the whole British Empire for this period, but we have figures which
will enable us to compute the number with sufficient accuracy for the purpose in hand. In England
and Wales there were some 59,000 seamen, and those of the rest of the empire amounted to about
21,000. Large as the 'waste' was in the Royal Navy, it was, and still is, much larger in the
merchant service. We may safely put it at 8 per cent. at least. Therefore, simply to keep up
its numbers--80,000--the merchant service would have had to engage fully 6400 fresh hands.
In view of these figures, it is difficult to believe that it could have furnished the navy
with 21,000 men, or, indeed, with any number approximating thereto. It could not possibly have
done so without restricting its operations, if only for a time. So far were its operations
from shrinking that they were positively extended. The English tonnage 'cleared outwards' from
our ports was for the years mentioned as follows: 1770, 703,495; 1771, 773,390; 1772 818,108.

Owing to the generally slow rate of sailing when on voyages and to the great length of time
taken in unloading and reloading abroad--both being often effected 'in the stream' and with
the ship's own boats--the figures for clearances outward much more nearly represented the amount
of our 'foreign-going' tonnage a century ago than similar figures would now in these days of
rapid movement. After 1771 the navy was reduced and kept at a relatively low standard till
1775. In that year the state of affairs in America rendered an increase of our naval forces
necessary. In 1778 we were at war with France; in 1779 with Spain as well; and in December
1780 we had the Dutch for enemies in addition. In September 1783 we were again at peace. The
way in which we had to increase the navy will be seen in the following table:--

   -------------------------------------------------------
  |       |           |           |          |   Total    |
  |       |  Seamen   |           |          | additional |

  | 1776  |  21,335   |   3,335   |  1,080   |    4,415   |
  | 1777  |  34,871   |  13,536   |  1,278   |   14,184   |

  | 1779  |  52,611   |   4,440   |  2,886   |    7,326   |
  | 1780  |  66,221   |  13,610   |  3,156   |   16,766   |
  | 1781  |  69,683   |   3,462   |  3,972   |    7,434   |
  | 1782  |  78,695   |   9,012   |  4,176   |   13,188   |
  | 1783  |  84,709   |   6,014   |  4,722   |   10,736   |
   -------------------------------------------------------

It cannot be believed that the merchant service, with its then dimensions, could have possibly
satisfied these great and repeated demands, besides making up its own 'waste,' unless its size
were much reduced. After 1777, indeed, there was a considerable fall in the figures of English
tonnage 'outwards.' I give these figures down to the first year of peace.

  1777  736,234 tons 'outwards.'
  1778  657,238   "      "
  1779  590,911   "      "
  1780  619,462   "      "
  1781  547,953   "      "
  1782  552,851   "      "
  1783  795,669   "      "
  1784  846,355   "      "

At first sight it would seem as if there had, indeed, been a shrinkage. We find, however, on
further examination that in reality there had been none. 'During the [American] war the ship-yards
in every port of Britain were full of employment; and consequently new ship-yards were set
up in places where ships had never been built before.' Even the diminution in the statistics
of outward clearances indicated no diminution in the number of merchant ships or their crews.
The missing tonnage was merely employed elsewhere. 'At this time there were about 1000 vessels
of private property employed by the Government as transports and in other branches of the public
service.' Of course there had been some diminution due to the transfer of what had been British-American
shipping to a new independent flag. This would not have set free any men to join the navy.

When we come to the Revolutionary war we find ourselves confronted
with similar conditions. The case of this war has often been
quoted as proving that in former days the navy had to rely
practically exclusively on the merchant service when expansion
was necessary. In giving evidence before a Parliamentary committee
about fifty years ago, Admiral Sir T. Byam Martin, referring
to the great increase of the fleet in 1793, said, 'It was the
merchant service that enabled us to man some sixty ships of the
line and double that number of frigates and smaller vessels.' He
added that we had been able to bring promptly together 'about
35,000 or 40,000 men of the mercantile marine.' The requirements
of the navy amounted, as stated by the admiral, to about 40,000
men; to be exact, 39,045. The number of seamen in the British
Empire in 1793 was 118,952. In the next year the number showed
no diminution; in fact it increased, though but slightly, to
119,629. How our merchant service could have satisfied the
above-mentioned immense demand on it in addition to making good
its waste and then have even increased is a thing that baffles
comprehension. No such example of elasticity is presented by
any other institution. Admiral Byam Martin spoke so positively,
and, indeed, with such justly admitted authority, that we should
have to give up the problem as insoluble were it not for other
passages in the admiral's own evidence. It may be mentioned that
all the witnesses did not hold his views. Sir James Stirling, an
officer of nearly if not quite equal authority, differed from
him. In continuation of his evidence Sir T. Byam Martin stated
that afterwards the merchant service could give only a small
and occasional supply, as ships arrived from foreign ports or as
apprentices grew out of their time. Now, during the remaining years
of this war and throughout the Napoleonic war, great as were the
demands of the navy, they only in one year, that of the rupture
of the Peace of Amiens, equalled the demand at the beginning of
the Revolutionary war. From the beginning of hostilities till
the final close of the conflict in 1815 the number of merchant
seamen fell only once--viz. in 1795, the fall being 3200. In 1795,
however, the demand for men for the navy was less than half that
of 1794. The utmost, therefore, that Sir T. Byam Martin desired
to establish was that, on a single occasion in an unusually
protracted continuance of war, the strength of our merchant service
enabled it to reinforce the navy up to the latter's requirements;
but its doing so prevented it from giving much help afterwards.
All the same, men in large numbers had to be found for the navy
yearly for a long time.  |

(No 'waste' is allowed for when there has been a reduction.)

It is a reasonable presumption that, except perhaps on a single occasion, the merchant service
did not furnish the men required--not from any want of patriotism or of public spirit, but
simply because it was impossible. Even as regards the single exception the evidence is not
uncontested; and by itself, though undoubtedly strong, it is not convincing, in view of the
well-grounded presumptions the other way. The question then that naturally arises is--If the
navy did not fill up its complements from the merchant service, how did it fill them up? The
answer is easy. Our naval complements were filled up largely with boys, largely with landsmen,
largely with fishermen, whose numbers permitted this without inconvenience to their trade in
general, and, to a small extent, with merchant seamen. It may be suggested that the men wanted
by the navy could have been passed on to it from our merchant vessels, which could then complete
their own crews with boys, landsmen, and fishermen. It was the age in which Dr. Price was a
great authority on public finance, the age of Mr. Pitt's sinking fund, when borrowed money
was repaid with further borrowings; so that a corresponding roundabout method for manning the
navy may have had attractions for some people. A conclusive reason why it was not adopted is
that its adoption would have been possible only at the cost of disorganising such a great industrial
undertaking as our maritime trade. That this disorganisation did not arise is proved by the
fact that our merchant service flourished and expanded.

It is widely supposed that, wherever the men wanted for the navy may have come from, they were
forced into it by the system of 'impressment.' The popular idea of a man-of-war's 'lower deck'
of a century ago is that it was inhabited by a ship's company which had been captured by the
press-gang and was restrained from revolting by the presence of a detachment of marines. The
prevalence of the belief that seamen were 'raised'--'recruited' is not a naval term--for the
navy by forcible means can be accounted for without difficulty. The supposed ubiquity of the
press-gang and its violent procedure added much picturesque detail, and even romance, to stories
of naval life. Stories connected with it, if authentic, though rare, would, indeed, make a
deep impression on the public; and what was really the exception would be taken for the rule.
There is no evidence to show that even from the middle of the seventeenth century any considerable
number of men was raised by forcible impressment. I am not acquainted with a single story of
the press-gang which, even when much embellished, professes to narrate the seizure of more
than an insignificant body. The allusions to forcible impressment made by naval historians
are, with few exceptions, complaints of the utter inefficiency of the plan. In Mr. David, Hannay's
excellent 'Short History of the Royal Navy' will be found more than one illustration of its
inefficient working in the seventeenth century. Confirmation, if confirmation is needed, can
be adduced on the high authority of Mr. M. Oppenheim. We wanted tens of thousands, and forcible
impressment was giving us half-dozens, or, at the best, scores. Even of those it provided,
but a small proportion was really forced to serve. Mr. Oppenheim tells us of an Act of Parliament
(17 Charles I) legalising forcible impressment, which seems to have been passed to satisfy
the sailors. If anyone should think this absurd, he may be referred to the remarkable expression
of opinion by some of the older seamen of Sunderland and Shields when the Russian war broke
out in 1854. The married sailors, they said, naturally waited for the impressment, for 'we
know that has always been and always will be preceded by the proclamation of bounty.'

The most fruitful source of error as to the procedure of the press-gang has been a deficient
knowledge of etymology. The word has, properly, no relation to the use of force, and has no
etymological connection with 'press' and its compounds, 'compress,' 'depress,' 'express,' 'oppress,'
&c. 'Prest money is so-called from the French word prest--that is, readie money, for that it
bindeth all those that have received it to be ready at all times appointed.' Professor Laughton
tells us that 'A prest or imprest was an earnest or advance paid on account. A prest man was
really a man who received the prest of 12d., as a soldier when enlisted.' Writers, and some
in an age when precision in spelling is thought important, have frequently spelled prest pressed,
and imprest impressed. The natural result has been that the thousands who had received 'prest
money' were classed as 'pressed' into the service by force.

The foregoing may be summed up as follows:--

For 170 years at least there never has been a time when the British merchant service did not
contain an appreciable percentage of foreigners.

During the last three (and greatest) maritime wars in which this country has been involved
only a small proportion of the immense number of men required by the navy came, or could have
come, from the merchant service.

The number of men raised for the navy by forcible impressment in war time has been enormously
exaggerated owing to a confusion of terms. As a matter of fact the number so raised, for quite
two centuries, was only an insignificant fraction of the whole.

V

FACTS AND FANCIES ABOUT THE PRESS-GANG[60]

[Footnote 60: Written in 1900, (NationalReview.)]

Of late years great attention has been paid to our naval history, and many even of its obscure
byways have been explored. A general result of the investigation is that we are enabled to
form a high estimate of the merits of our naval administration in former centuries. We find
that for a long time the navy has possessed an efficient organisation; that its right position
as an element of the national defences was understood ages ago; and that English naval officers
of a period which is now very remote showed by their actions that they exactly appreciated
and--when necessary--were able to apply the true principles of maritime warfare. If anyone
still believes that the country has been saved more than once merely by lucky chances of weather,
and that the England of Elizabeth has been converted into the great oceanic and colonial British
Empire of Victoria in 'a fit of absence of mind,' it will not be for want of materials with
which to form a correct judgment on these points.

It has been accepted generally that the principal method of manning our fleet in the past--especially
when war threatened to arise--was to seize and put men on board the ships by force. This has
been taken for granted by many, and it seems to have been assumed that, in any case, there
is no way of either proving it or disproving it. The truth, however, is that it is possible
and--at least as regards the period of our last great naval war--not difficult to make sure
if it is true or not. Records covering a long succession of years still exist, and in these
can be found the name of nearly every seaman in the navy and a statement of the conditions
on which he joined it. The exceptions would not amount to more than a few hundreds out of many
tens of thousands of names, and would be due to the disappearance--in itself very infrequent--of
some of the documents and to occasional, but also very rare, inaccuracies in the entries.

The historical evidence on which the belief in the prevalence of impressment as a method of
recruiting the navy for more than a hundred years is based, is limited to contemporary statements
in the English newspapers, and especially in the issues of the periodical called TheNavalChronicle,
published in 1803, the first year of the war following the rupture of the Peace of Amiens.
Readers of Captain Mahan's works on Sea-Power will remember the picture he draws of the activity
of the press-gang in that year, his authority being TheNavalChronicle. This evidence will be
submitted directly to close examination, and we shall see what importance ought to be attached
to it. In the great majority of cases, however, the belief above mentioned has no historical
foundation, but is to be traced to the frequency with which the supposed operations of the
press-gang were used by the authors of naval stories and dramas, and by artists who took scenes
of naval life for their subject. Violent seizure and abduction lend themselves to effective
treatment in literature and in art, and writers and painters did not neglect what was so plainly
suggested.

A fruitful source of the widespread belief that our navy in the old days was chiefly manned
by recourse to compulsion, is a confusion between two words of independent origin and different
meaning, which, in ages when exact spelling was not thought indispensable, came to be written
and pronounced alike. During our later great maritime wars, the official term applied to anyone
recruited by impressment was 'prest-man.' In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and part
of the eighteenth century, this term meant the exact opposite. It meant a man who had voluntarily
engaged to serve, and who had received a sum in advance called 'prest-money.' 'A prest-man,'
we are told by that high authority, Professor Sir J. K. Laughton, 'was really a man who received
the prest of 12d., as a soldier when enlisted.' In the 'Encyclopædia Metropolitana' (1845),
we find:-- 'Impressing, or, more correctly, impresting, i.e. paying earnest-money to seamen
by the King's Commission to the Admiralty, is a right of very ancient date, and established
by prescription, though not by statute. Many statutes, however, imply its existence--one as
far back as 2 Richard II, cap. 4.' An old dictionary of James I's time (1617), called 'The
Guide into the Tongues, by the Industrie, Studie, Labour, and at the Charges of John Minshew,'
gives the following definition:--'Imprest-money. G. [Gallic or French], Imprest-ànce; Imprestanza,
from in and prestare, to lend or give beforehand.... Presse-money. T. [Teutonic or German],
Soldt, from salz, salt. For anciently agreement or compact between the General and the soldier
was signified by salt.' Minshew also defines the expression 'to presse souldiers' by the German
soldatenwerben, and explains that here the word werben means prepare (parare). 'Prest-money,'
he says, 'is so-called of the French word prest, i.e. readie, for that it bindeth those that
have received it to be ready at all times appointed.' In the posthumous work of Stephen Skinner,
'Etymologia Linguæ Anglicanæ' (1671), the author joins together 'press or imprest' as though
they were the same, and gives two definitions, viz.: (1) recruiting by force (militescogere);
(2) paying soldiers a sum of money and keeping them ready to serve. Dr. Murray's 'New English
Dictionary,' now in course of publication, gives instances of the confusion between imprest
and impress. A consequence of this confusion has been that many thousands of seamen who had
received an advance of money have been regarded as carried off to the navy by force. If to
this misunderstanding we add the effect on the popular mind of cleverly written stories in
which the press-gang figured prominently, we can easily see how the belief in an almost universal
adoption of compulsory recruiting for the navy became general. It should, therefore, be no
matter of surprise when we find that the sensational reports published in the English newspapers
in 1803 were accepted without question.

Impressment of seamen for the navy has been called 'lawless,' and sometimes it has been asserted
that it was directly contrary to law. There is, however, no doubt that it was perfectly legal,
though its legality was not based upon any direct statutory authority. Indirect confirmations
of it by statute are numerous. These appear in the form of exemptions. The law of the land
relating to this subject was that all 'sea-faring' men were liable to impressment unless specially
protected by custom or statute. A consideration of the long list of exemptions tends to make
one believe that in reality very few people were liable to be impressed. Some were 'protected'
by local custom, some by statute, and some by administrative order. The number of the last
must have been very great. The 'Protection Books' preserved in the Public Record Office form
no inconsiderable section of the Admiralty records. For the period specially under notice,
viz. that beginning with the year 1803, there are no less than five volumes of 'protections.'
Exemptions by custom probably originated at a very remote date: ferrymen, for example, being
everywhere privileged from impressment. The crews of colliers seem to have enjoyed the privilege
by custom before it was confirmed by Act of Parliament. The naval historian, Burchett, writing
of 1691, cites a 'Proclamation forbidding pressing men from colliers.'

Every ship in the coal trade had the following persons protected, viz. two A.B.'s for every
ship of 100 tons, and one for every 50 tons in larger ships. When we come to consider the sensational
statements in TheNavalChronicle of 1803, it will be well to remember what the penalty for infringing
the colliers' privilege was. By the Act 6 & 7 William III, c. 18, sect. 19, 'Any officer who
presumes to impress any of the above shall forfeit to the master or owner of such vessel £10
for every man so impressed; and such officer shall be incapable of holding any place, office,
or employment in any of His Majesty's ships of war.' It is not likely that the least scrupulous
naval officer would make himself liable to professional ruin as well as to a heavy fine. No
parish apprentice could be impressed for the sea service of the Crown until he arrived at the
age of eighteen (2 & 3 Anne, c. 6, sect. 4). Persons voluntarily binding themselves apprentices
to sea service could not be impressed for three years from the date of their indentures. Besides
sect. 15 of the Act of Anne just quoted, exemptions were granted, before 1803, by 4 Anne, c.
19; and 13 George II, c. 17. By the Act last mentioned all persons fifty-five years of age
and under eighteen were exempted, and every foreigner serving in a ship belonging to a British
subject, and also all persons 'of what age soever who shall use the sea' for two years, to
be computed from the time of their first using it. A customary exemption was extended to the
proportion of the crew of any ship necessary for her safe navigation. In practice this must
have reduced the numbers liable to impressment to small dimensions.

Even when the Admiralty decided to suspend all administrative exemptions--or, as the phrase
was, 'to press from all protections'--many persons were still exempted. The customary and statutory
exemptions, of course, were unaffected. On the 5th November 1803 their Lordships informed officers
in charge of rendezvous that it was 'necessary for the speedy manning of H.M. ships to impress
all persons of the denominations exprest in the press-warrant which you have received from
us, without regard to any protections, excepting, however, all such persons as are protected
pursuant to Acts of Parliament, and all others who by the printed instructions which accompanied
the said warrant are forbidden to be imprest.' In addition to these a long list of further
exemptions was sent. The last in the list included the crews of 'ships and vessels bound to
foreign parts which are laden and cleared outwards by the proper officers of H.M. Customs.'
It would seem that there was next to no one left liable to impressment; and it is not astonishing
that the Admiralty, as shown by its action very shortly afterwards, felt that pressing seamen
was a poor way of manning the fleet.

Though the war which broke out in 1803 was not formally declared until May, active preparations
were begun earlier. The navy had been greatly reduced since the Peace of Amiens, and as late
as the 2nd December 1802 the House of Commons had voted that '50,000 seamen be employed for
the service of the year 1803, including 12,000 marines.' On the 14th March an additional number
was voted. It amounted to 10,000 men, of whom 2400 were to be marines. Much larger additions
were voted a few weeks later. The total increase was 50,000 men; viz. 39,600 seamen and 10,400
marines. It never occurred to anyone that forcible recruiting would be necessary in the case
of the marines, though the establishment of the corps was to be nearly doubled, as it had to
be brought up to 22,400 from 12,000. Attention may be specially directed to this point. The
marine formed an integral part of a man-of-war's crew just as the seamen did. He received no
better treatment than the latter; and as regards pecuniary remuneration, prospects of advancement,
and hope of attaining to the position of warrant officer, was, on the whole, in a less favourable
position. It seems to have been universally accepted that voluntary enlistment would prove--as,
in fact, it did prove--sufficient in the case of the marines. What we have got to see is how
far it failed in the case of the seamen, and how far its deficiencies were made up by compulsion.

On the 12th March the Admiralty notified the Board of Ordnance that twenty-two ships of the
line--the names of which were stated--were 'coming forward' for sea. Many of these ships are
mentioned in TheNavalChronicle as requiring men, and that journal gives the names of several
others of various classes in the same state. The number altogether is thirty-one. The aggregate
complements, including marines and boys, of these ships amounted to 17,234. The number of 'seamen'
was 11,861, though this included some of the officers who were borne on the same muster-list.
The total number of seamen actually required exceeded 11,500. The Naval Chronicle contains
a vivid, not to say sensational, account of the steps taken to raise them. The report from
Plymouth, dated 10th March, is as follows: 'Several bodies of Royal Marines in parties of twelve
and fourteen each, with their officers and naval officers armed, proceeded towards the quays.
So secret were the orders kept that they did not know the nature of the business on which they
were going until they boarded the tier of colliers at the New Quay, and other gangs the ships
in the Catwater and the Pool, and the gin-shops. A great number of prime seamen were taken
out and sent on board the Admiral's ship. They also pressed landsmen of all descriptions; and
the town looked as if in a state of siege. At Stonehouse, Mutton Cove, Morris Town, and in
all the receiving and gin-shops at Dock [the present Devonport] several hundreds of seamen
and landsmen were picked up and sent directly aboard the flag-ship. By the returns last night
it appears that upwards of 400 useful hands were pressed last night in the Three Towns....
One press-gang entered the Dock [Devonport] Theatre and cleared the whole gallery except the
women.' The reporter remarks: 'It is said that near 600 men have been impressed in this neighbourhood.'
The number--if obtained--would not have been sufficient to complete the seamen in the complements
of a couple of line-of-battle ships. Naval officers who remember the methods of manning ships
which lasted well into the middle of the nineteenth century, and of course long after recourse
to impressment had been given up, will probably notice the remarkable fact that the reporter
makes no mention of any of the parties whose proceedings he described being engaged in picking
up men who had voluntarily joined ships fitting out, but had not returned on board on the expiration
of the leave granted them. The description in TheNavalChronicle might be applied to events
which--when impressment had ceased for half a century--occurred over and over again at Portsmouth,
Devonport, and other ports when two or three ships happened to be put in commission about the
same time.

We shall find that the 600 reported as impressed had to be considerably reduced before long.
The reporter afterwards wisely kept himself from giving figures, except in a single instance
when he states that 'about forty' were taken out of the flotilla of Plymouth trawlers. Reporting
on 11th March he says that 'Last Thursday and yesterday'--the day of the sensational report
above given--'several useful hands were picked up, mostly seamen, who were concealed in the
different lodgings and were discovered by their girls.' He adds, 'Several prime seamen were
yesterday taken disguised as labourers in the different marble quarries round the town.' On
14th October the report is that 'the different press-gangs, with their officers, literally
scoured the country on the eastern roads and picked up several fine young fellows.' Here, again,
no distinction is drawn between men really impressed and men who were arrested for being absent
beyond the duration of their leave. We are told next that 'upon a survey of all impressed men
before three captains and three surgeons of the Royal Navy, such as were deemed unfit for His
Majesty's service, as well as all apprentices, were immediately discharged,' which, no doubt,
greatly diminished the above-mentioned 600.

The reporter at Portsmouth begins his account of the 'press' at that place by saying, 'They
indiscriminately took every man on board the colliers.' In view of what we know of the heavy
penalties to which officers who pressed more than a certain proportion of a collier's crew
were liable, we may take it that this statement was made in error. On 14th March it was reported
that 'the constables and gangs from the ships continue very alert in obtaining seamen, many
of whom have been sent on board different ships in the harbour this day.' We do not hear again
from Portsmouth till May, on the 7th of which month it was reported that 'about 700 men were
obtained.' On the 8th the report was that 'on Saturday afternoon the gates of the town were
shut and soldiers placed at every avenue. Tradesmen were taken from their shops and sent on
board the ships in the harbour or placed in the guard-house for the night, till they could
be examined. If fit for His Majesty's service they were kept, if in trade set at liberty.'
The 'tradesmen,' then, if really taken, were taken simply to be set free again. As far as the
reports first quoted convey any trustworthy information, it appears that at Portsmouth and
Plymouth during March, April, and the first week of May, 1340 men were 'picked up,' and that
of these many were immediately discharged. How many of the 1340 were not really impressed,
but were what in the navy are called 'stragglers,' i.e. men over-staying their leave of absence,
is not indicated.

TheTimes of the 11th March 1803, and 9th May 1803, also contained reports of the impressment
operations. It says: 'The returns to the Admiralty of the seamen impressed (apparently at the
Thames ports) on Tuesday night amounted to 1080, of whom no less than two-thirds are considered
prime hands. At Portsmouth, Portsea, Gosport, and Cowes a general press took place the same
night.... Upwards of 600 seamen were collected in consequence of the promptitude of the measures
adopted.' It was added that the Government 'relied upon increasing our naval forces with 10,000
seamen, either volunteers or impressed men, in less than a fortnight.' The figures show us
how small a proportion of the 10,000 was even alleged to be made up of impressed men. A later
Times report is that: 'The impress on Saturday, both above and below the bridge, was the hottest
that has been for some time. The boats belonging to the ships at Deptford were particularly
active, and it is supposed they obtained upwards of 200 men.' The Times reports thus account
for 1280 men over and above the 1340 stated to have been impressed at Plymouth and Portsmouth,
thus making a grand total of 2620. It will be proved by official figures directly that the
last number was an over-estimate.

Before going farther, attention may be called to one or two points in connection with the above
reports. The increase in the number of seamen voted by Parliament in March was 7600. The reports
of the impressment operations only came down to May. It was not till the 11th June that Parliament
voted a further addition to the navy of 32,000 seamen. Yet whilst the latter great increase
was being obtained--for obtained it was--the reporters are virtually silent as to the action
of the press-gang. We must ask ourselves, if we could get 32,000 additional seamen with so
little recourse to impressment that the operations called for no special notice, how was it
that compulsion was necessary when only 7600 men were wanted? The question is all the more
pertinent when we recall the state of affairs in the early part of 1803.

The navy had been greatly reduced in the year before, the men voted having diminished from
100,000 to 56,000. What became of the 44,000 men not required, of whom about 35,000 must have
been of the seaman class and have been discharged from the service? There was a further reduction
of 6000, to take effect in the beginning of 1803. Sir Sydney Smith, at that time a Member of
Parliament, in the debate of the 2nd December 1802, 'expressed considerable regret at the great
reductions which were suddenly made, both in the King's dockyards and in the navy in general.
A prodigious number of men,' he said, 'had been thus reduced to the utmost poverty and distress.'
He stated that he 'knew, from his own experience, that what was called an ordinary seaman could
hardly find employment at present, either in the King's or in the merchants' service.' The
increase of the fleet in March must have seemed a godsend to thousands of men-of-war's men.
If there was any holding back on their part, it was due, no doubt, to an expectation--which
the sequel showed to be well founded--that a bounty would be given to men joining the navy.

The muster-book of a man-of-war is the official list of her crew. It contains the name of every
officer and man in the complement. Primarily it was an account-book, as it contains entries
of the payments made to each person whose name appears in it. At the beginning of the nineteenth
century it was usual to make out a fresh muster-book every two months, though that period was
not always exactly adhered to. Each new book was a copy of the preceding one, with the addition
of the names of persons who had joined the ship since the closing of the latter. Until the
ship was paid off and thus put out of commission--or, in the case of a very long commission,
until 'new books' were ordered to be opened so as to escape the inconveniences due to the repetition
of large numbers of entries--the name of every man that had belonged to her remained on the
list, his disposal--if no longer in the ship--being noted in the proper column. One column
was headed 'Whence, and whether prest or not?' In this was noted his former ship, or the fact
of his being entered direct from the shore, which answered to the question 'Whence?' There
is reason to believe that the muster-book being, as above said, primarily an account-book,
the words 'whether prest or not' were originally placed at the head of the column so that it
might be noted against each man entered whether he had been paid 'prest-money' or not. However
this may be, the column at the beginning of the nineteenth century was used for a record of
the circumstances of the man's entering the ship, whether he had been transferred from another,
had joined as a volunteer from the shore, or had been impressed.

I have examined the muster-book of every ship mentioned in the Admiralty letter to the Board
of Ordnance above referred to, and also of the ships mentioned in TheNavalChronicle as fitting
out in the early part of 1803. There are altogether thirty-three ships; but two of them, the
Utrecht and the Gelykheid, were used as temporary receiving ships for newly raised men.[61]
The names on their lists are, therefore, merely those of men who were passed on to other ships,
in whose muster-books they appeared again. There remained thirty-one ships which, as far as
could be ascertained, account for the additional force which the Government had decided to
put in commission, more than two-thirds of them being ships of the line. As already stated,
their total complements amounted to 17,234, and the number of the 'blue-jackets' of full age
to at least 11,500. The muster-books appear to have been kept with great care. The only exception
seems to be that of the Victory, in which there is some reason to think the number of men noted
as 'prest' has been over-stated owing to an error in copying the earlier book. Ships in 1803
did not get their full crews at once, any more than they did half a century later. I have,
therefore, thought it necessary to take the muster-books for the months in which the crews
had been brought up to completion.

[Footnote 61: The words 'recruit' and 'enlist,' except as regards marines, are unknown in the
navy, in which they are replaced by 'raise' and 'enter.']

An examination of the books would be likely to dispel many misconceptions about the old navy.
Not only is it noted against each man's name whether he was 'pressed' or a volunteer, it is
also noted if he was put on board ship as an alternative to imprisonment on shore, this being
indicated by the words 'civil power,' an expression still used in the navy, but with a different
meaning. The percentage of men thus 'raised' was small. Sometimes there is a note stating that
the man had been allowed to enter from the '----shire Militia.' A rare note is 'Brought on
board by soldiers,' which most likely indicated that the man had been recaptured when attempting
to desert. It is sometimes asserted that many men who volunteered did so only to escape impressment.
This may be so; but it should be said that there are frequent notations against the names of
'prest' men that they afterwards volunteered. This shows the care that was taken to ascertain
the real conditions on which a man entered the service. For the purposes of this inquiry all
these men have been considered as impressed, and they have not been counted amongst the volunteers.
It is, perhaps, permissible to set off against such men the number of those who allowed themselves
to be impressed to escape inconveniences likely to be encountered if they remained at home.
Of two John Westlakes, ordinary seamen of the Boadicea, one--John (I.)--was 'prest,' but was
afterwards 'taken out of the ship for a debt of twenty pounds'; which shows that he had preferred
to trust himself to the press-gang rather than to his creditors. Without being unduly imaginative,
we may suppose that in 1803 there were heroes who preferred being 'carried off' to defend their
country afloat to meeting the liabilities of putative paternity in their native villages.

The muster-books examined cover several months, during which many 'prest' men were discharged
and some managed to desert, so that the total was never present at anyone time. That total
amounts to 1782. It is certain that even this is larger than the reality, because it has been
found impossible--without an excessive expenditure of time and labour--to trace the cases of
men being sent from one ship to another, and thus appearing twice over, or oftener, as 'prest'
men. As an example of this the Minotaur may be cited. Out of twenty names on one page of her
muster-book thirteen are those of 'prest' men discharged to other ships. The discharges from
the Victory were numerous; and the Ardent, which was employed in keeping up communication with
the ships off Brest, passed men on to the latter when required. I have, however, made no deductions
from the 'prest' total to meet these cases. We can see that not more than 1782 men, and probably
considerably fewer, were impressed to meet the increase of the navy during the greater part
of 1803. Admitting that there were cases of impressment from merchant vessels abroad to complete
the crews of our men-of-war in distant waters, the total number impressed--including these
latter--could not have exceeded greatly the figures first given. We know that owing to the
reduction of 1802, as stated by Sir Sydney Smith, the seamen were looking for ships rather
than the ships for seamen. It seems justifiable to infer that the whole number of impressed
men on any particular day did not exceed, almost certainly did not amount to, 2000. If they
had been spread over the whole navy they would not have made 2 per cent. of the united complements
of the ships; and, as it was, did not equal one-nineteenth of the 39,600 seamen ('blue-jackets')
raised to complete the navy to the establishment sanctioned by Parliament. A system under which
more than 37,000 volunteers come forward to serve and less than 2000 men are obtained by compulsion
cannot be properly called compulsory.

The Plymouth reporter of TheNavalChronicle does not give many details of the volunteering for
the navy in 1803, though he alludes to it in fluent terms more than once. On the 11th October,
however, he reports that, 'So many volunteer seamen have arrived here this last week that upwards
of £4000 bounty is to be paid them afloat by the Paying Commissioner, Rear-Admiral Dacres.'
At the time the bounty was £2 10s. for an A.B., £1 10s. for an ordinary seaman, and £1 for
a landsman. Taking only £4000 as the full amount paid, and assuming that the three classes
were equally represented, three men were obtained for every £5, or 2400 in all, a number raised
in about a week, that may be compared with that given as resulting from impressment. In reality,
the number of volunteers must have been larger, because the A.B.'s were fewer than the other
classes.

Some people may be astonished because the practice of impressment, which had proved to be so
utterly inefficient, was not at once and formally given up. No astonishment will be felt by
those who are conversant with the habits of Government Departments. In every country public
officials evince great and, indeed, almost invincible reluctance to give up anything, whether
it be a material object or an administrative process, which they have once possessed or conducted.
One has only to stroll through the arsenals of the world, or glance at the mooring-grounds
of the maritime states, to see to what an extent the passion for retaining the obsolete and
useless holds dominion over the official mind. A thing may be known to be valueless--its retention
may be proved to be mischievous--yet proposals to abandon it will be opposed and defeated.
It is doubtful if any male human being over forty was ever converted to a new faith of any
kind. The public has to wait until the generation of administrative Conservatives has either
passed away or been outnumbered by those acquainted only with newer methods. Then the change
is made; the certainty, nevertheless, being that the new men in their turn will resist improvements
as obstinately and in exactly the same way as their predecessors.

To be just to the Board of Admiralty of 1803, it must be admitted that some of its members
seem to have lost faith in the efficacy of impressment as a system of manning the navy. The
Lords Commissioners of that date could hardly--all of them, at any rate--have been so thoroughly
destitute of humour as not to suspect that seizing a few score of men here and a few there
when tens of thousands were needed, was a very insufficient compensation for the large correspondence
necessitated by adherence to the system (and still in existence). Their Lordships actively
bombarded the Home Office with letters pointing out, for example, that a number of British
seamen at Guernsey 'appeared to have repaired to that island with a view to avoid being pressed';
that they were 'of opinion that it would be highly proper that the sea-faring men (in Jersey
as well as Guernsey), not natives nor settled inhabitants, should be impressed'; that when
the captain of H.M.S. Aigle had landed at Portland 'for the purpose of raising men' some resistance
had 'been made by the sailors'; and dealing with other subjects connected with the system.
A complaint sent to the War Department was that 'amongst a number of men lately impressed (at
Leith) there were eight or ten shipwrights who were sea-faring men, and had been claimed as
belonging to a Volunteer Artillery Corps.'

We may suspect that there was some discussion at Whitehall as to the wisdom of retaining a
plan which caused so much inconvenience and had such poor results. The conclusion seems to
have been to submit it to a searching test. The coasts of the United Kingdom were studded with
stations--thirty-seven generally, but the number varied--for the entry of seamen. The ordinary
official description of these--as shown by entries in the muster-books--was 'rendezvous'; but
other terms were used. It has often been thought that they were simply impressment offices.
The fact is that many more men were raised at these places by volunteering than by impressment.
The rendezvous, as a rule, were in charge of captains or commanders, some few being entrusted
to lieutenants. The men attached to each were styled its 'gang,' a word which conveys no discredit
in nautical language. On 5th November 1803 the Admiralty sent to the officers in charge of
rendezvous the communication already mentioned--to press men 'without regard to any protections,'--the
exceptions, indeed, being so many that the officers must have wondered who could legitimately
be taken.

The order at first sight appeared sweeping enough. It contained the following words: 'Whereas
we think fit that a general press from all protections as above mentioned shall commence at
London and in the neighbourhood thereof on the night of Monday next, the 7th instant, you are
therefore (after taking the proper preparatory measures with all possible secrecy) hereby required
to impress and to give orders to the lieutenants under your command to impress all persons
of the above-mentioned denominations (except as before excepted) and continue to do so until
you receive orders from us to the contrary.' As it was addressed to officers in all parts of
the United Kingdom, the 'general press' was not confined to London and its neighbourhood, though
it was to begin in the capital.

Though returns of the numbers impressed have not been discovered, we have strong evidence that
this 'general press,' notwithstanding the secrecy with which it had been arranged, was a failure.
On the 6th December 1803, just a month after it had been tried, the Admiralty formulated the
following conclusion: 'On a consideration of the expense attending the service of raising men
on shore for His Majesty's Fleet comparatively with the number procured, as well as from other
circumstances, there is reason to believe that either proper exertions have not been made by
some of the officers employed on that service, or that there have been great abuses and mismanagement
in the expenditure of the public money.' This means that it was now seen that impressment,
though of little use in obtaining men for the navy, was a very costly arrangement. The Lords
of the Admiralty accordingly ordered that 'the several places of rendezvous should be visited
and the conduct of the officers employed in carrying out the above-mentioned service should
be inquired into on the spot.' Rear-Admiral Arthur Phillip, the celebrated first Governor of
New South Wales, was ordered to make the inquiry. This was the last duty in which that distinguished
officer was employed, and his having been selected for it appears to have been unknown to all
his biographers.

It is not surprising that after this the proceedings of the press-gang occupy scarcely any
space in our naval history. Such references to them as there are will be found in the writings
of the novelist and the dramatist. Probably individual cases of impressment occurred till nearly
the end of the Great War; but they could not have been many. Compulsory service most unnecessarily
caused--not much, but still some--unjustifiable personal hardship. It tended to stir up a feeling
hostile to the navy. It required to work it machinery costly out of all proportion to the results
obtained. Indeed, it failed completely to effect what had been expected of it. In the great
days of old our fleet, after all, was manned, not by impressed men, but by volunteers. It was
largely due to that that we became masters of the sea.

VI

PROJECTED INVASIONS OF THE BRITISH ISLES[62]

[Footnote 62: Written in 1900. (TheTimes.)]

The practice to which we have become accustomed of late, of publishing original documents relating
to naval and military history, has been amply justified by the results. These meet the requirements
of two classes of readers. The publications satisfy, or at any rate go far towards satisfying,
the wishes of those who want to be entertained, and also of those whose higher motive is a
desire to discover the truth about notable historical occurrences. Putting the public in possession
of the materials, previously hidden in more or less inaccessible muniment-rooms and record
offices, with which the narratives of professed historians have been constructed, has had advantages
likely to become more and more apparent as time goes on. It acts as a check upon the imaginative
tendencies which even eminent writers have not always been able, by themselves, to keep under
proper control. The certainty, nay the mere probability, that you will be confronted with the
witnesses on whose evidence you profess to have relied--the 'sources' from which your story
is derived--will suggest the necessity of sobriety of statement and the advisability of subordinating
rhetoric to veracity. Had the contemporary documents been available for an immediate appeal
to them by the reading public, we should long ago have rid ourselves of some dangerous superstitions.
We should have abandoned our belief in the fictions that the Armada of 1588 was defeated by
the weather, and that the great Herbert of Torrington was a lubber, a traitor, and a coward.
It is not easy to calculate the benefit that we should have secured, had the presentation of
some important events in the history of our national defence been as accurate as it was effective.
Enormous sums of money have been wasted in trying to make our defensive arrangements square
with a conception of history based upon misunderstanding or misinterpretation of facts. Pecuniary
extravagance is bad enough; but there is a greater evil still. We have been taught to cherish,
and we have been reluctant to abandon, a false standard of defence, though adherence to such
a standard can be shown to have brought the country within measurable distance of grievous
peril. Captain Duro, of the Spanish Navy, in his 'Armada Invencible,' placed within our reach
contemporary evidence from the side of the assailants, thereby assisting us to form a judgment
on a momentous episode in naval history. The evidence was completed; some being adduced from
the other side, by our fellow-countryman Sir J. K. Laughton, in his 'Defeat of the Spanish
Armada,' published by the Navy Records Society. Others have worked on similar lines; and a
healthier view of our strategic conditions and needs is more widely held than it was; though
it cannot be said to be, even yet, universally prevalent. Superstition, even the grossest,
dies hard.

Something deeper than mere literary interest, therefore, is to be attributed to a work which
has recently appeared in Paris.[63] To speak strictly, it should be said that only the first
volume of three which will complete it has been published. It is, however, in the nature of
a work of the kind that its separate parts should be virtually independent of each other. Consequently
the volume which we now have may be treated properly as a book by itself. When completed the
work is to contain all the documents relating to the French preparations during the period
1793-1805, for taking the offensive against England (touslesdocumentsserapportant àlapréparationdel'offensivecontrel'Angleterre).
The search for, the critical examination and the methodical classification of, the papers were
begun in October 1898. The book is compiled by Captain Desbrière, of the French Cuirassiers,
who was specially authorised to continue his editorial labours even after he had resumed his
ordinary military duties. It bears the imprimatur of the staff of the army; and its preface
is written by an officer who was--and so signs himself--chief of the historical section of
that department. There is no necessity to criticise the literary execution of the work. What
is wanted is to explain the nature of its contents and to indicate the lessons which may be
drawn from them. Nevertheless, attention may be called to a curious misreading of history contained
in the preface. In stating the periods which the different volumes of the book are to cover,
the writer alludes to the Peace of Amiens, which, he affirms, England was compelled to accept
by exhaustion, want of means of defence, and fear of the menaces of the great First Consul
then disposing of the resources of France, aggrandised, pacified, and reinforced by alliances.
The book being what it is and coming whence it does, such a statement ought not to be passed
over. 'The desire for peace,' says an author so easily accessible as J. R. Green, 'sprang from
no sense of national exhaustion. On the contrary, wealth had never increased so fast.... Nor
was there any ground for despondency in the aspect of the war itself.' This was written in
1875 by an author so singularly free from all taint of Chauvinism that he expressly resolved
that his work 'should never sink into a drum and trumpet history.' A few figures will be interesting
and, it may be added, conclusive. Between 1793 when the war began and 1802 when the Peace of
Amiens interrupted it, the public income of Great Britain increased from £16,382,000 to £28,000,000,
the war taxes not being included in the latter sum. The revenue of France, notwithstanding
her territorial acquisitions, sank from £18,800,000 to £18,000,000. The French exports and
imports by sea were annihilated; whilst the British exports were doubled and the imports increased
more than 50 per cent. The French Navy had at the beginning 73, at the end of the war 39, ships
of the line; the British began the contest with 135 and ended it with 202. Even as regards
the army, the British force at the end of the war was not greatly inferior numerically to the
French. It was, however, much scattered, being distributed over the whole British Empire. In
view of the question under discussion, no excuse need be given for adducing these facts.

Desbrière, Capitaine breveté aux 1er Cuirassiers. Paris, Chapelot et Cie. 1900. (Publié sous
la direction de la section historique de l'État-Major de l'Armée.)]

Captain Desbrière in the present volume carries his collection of documents down to the date
at which the then General Bonaparte gave up his connection with the flotilla that was being
equipped in the French Channel ports, and prepared to take command of the expedition to Egypt.
The volume therefore, in addition to accounts of many projected, but never really attempted,
descents on the British Isles, gives a very complete history of Hoche's expedition to Ireland;
of the less important, but curious, descent in Cardigan Bay known as the Fishguard, or Fishgard,
expedition; and of the formation of the first 'Army of England,' a designation destined to
attain greater celebrity in the subsequent war, when France was ruled by the great soldier
whom we know as the Emperor Napoleon. The various documents are connected by Captain Desbrière
with an explanatory commentary, and here and there are illustrated with notes. He has not rested
content with the publication of MSS. selected from the French archives. In preparing his book
he visited England and examined our records; and, besides, he has inserted in their proper
place passages from Captain Mahan's works and also from those of English authors. The reader's
interest in the book is likely to be almost exclusively concentrated on the detailed, and,
where Captain Desbrière's commentary appears, lucid, account of Hoche's expedition. Of course,
the part devoted to the creation of the 'Army of England' is not uninteresting; but it is distinctly
less so than the part relating to the proceedings of Hoche. Several of the many plans submitted
by private persons, who here describe them in their own words, are worth examination; and some,
it may be mentioned, are amusing in the naïveté of their Anglophobia and in their obvious indifference
to the elementary principles of naval strategy. In this indifference they have some distinguished
companions.

We are informed by Captain Desbrière that the idea of a hostile descent on England was during
a long time much favoured in France. The national archives and those of the Ministries of War
and of Marine are filled with proposals for carrying it out, some dating back to 1710. Whether
emanating from private persons or formulated in obedience to official direction, there are
certain features in all the proposals so marked that we are able to classify the various schemes
by grouping together those of a similar character. In one class may be placed all those which
aimed at mere annoyance, to be effected by landing small bodies of men, not always soldiers,
to do as much damage as possible. The appearance of these at many different points, it was
believed, would so harass the English that they would end the war, or at least so divide their
forces that their subjection might be looked for with confidence. In another class might be
placed proposals to seize outlying, out not distant, British territory--the Channel Islands
or the Isle of Wight, for example. A third class might comprise attempts on a greater scale,
necessitating the employment of a considerable body of troops and meriting the designation
'Invasion.' Some of these attempts were to be made in Great Britain, some in Ireland. In every
proposal for an attempt of this class, whether it was to be made in Great Britain or in Ireland,
it was assumed that the invaders would receive assistance from the people of the country invaded.
Indeed, generally the bulk of the force to be employed was ultimately to be composed of native
sympathisers, who were also to provide--at least at the beginning--all the supplies and transport,
both vehicles and animals, required. Every plan, no matter to which class it might belong,
was based upon the assumption that the British naval force could be avoided. Until we come
to the time when General Bonaparte, as he then was, dissociated himself from the first 'Army
of England,' there is no trace, in any of the documents now printed, of a belief in the necessity
of obtaining command of the sea before sending across it a considerable military expedition.
That there was such a thing as the command of the sea is rarely alluded to; and when it is,
it is merely to accentuate the possibility of neutralising it by evading the force holding
it. There is something which almost deserves to be styled comical in the absolutely unvarying
confidence, alike of amateurs and highly placed military officers, with which it was held that
a superior naval force was a thing that might be disregarded. Generals who would have laughed
to scorn anyone maintaining that, though there was a powerful Prussian army on the road to
one city and an Austrian army on the road to the other, a French army might force its way to
either Berlin or Vienna without either fighting or even being prepared to fight, such generals
never hesitated to approve expeditions obliged to traverse a region in the occupation of a
greatly superior force, the region being pelagic and the force naval. We had seized the little
islands of St. Marcoff, a short distance from the coast of Normandy, and held them for years.
It was expressly admitted that their recapture was impossible, 'à raison de la supériorité
des forces navales Anglaises'; but it was not even suspected that a much more difficult operation,
requiring longer time and a longer voyage, was likely to be impracticable. We shall see by
and by how far this remarkable attitude of mind was supported by the experience of Hoche's
expedition to Ireland.

Hoche himself was the inventor of a plan of harassing the English enemy which long remained
in favour. He proposed to organise what was called a Chouannerie in England. As that country
had no Chouans of her own, the want was to be supplied by sending over an expedition composed
of convicts. Hoche's ideas were approved and adopted by the eminent Carnot. The plan, to which
the former devoted great attention, was to land on the coast of Wales from 1000 to 1200 forçats,
to be commanded by a certain Mascheret, of whom Hoche wrote that he was 'le plus mauvais sujet
dont on puisse purger la France.' In a plan accepted and forwarded by Hoche, it was laid down
that the band, on reaching the enemy's country, was, if possible, not to fight, but to pillage;
each man was to understand that he was sent to England to steal 100,000f., 'pour ensuite finir
sa carrière tranquillement dans l'aisance,' and was to be informed that he would receive a
formal pardon from the French Government. The plan, extraordinary as it was, was one of the
few put into execution. The famous Fishguard Invasion was carried out by some fourteen hundred
convicts commanded by an American adventurer named Tate. The direction to avoid fighting was
exactly obeyed by Colonel Tate and the armed criminals under his orders. He landed in Cardigan
Bay from a small squadron of French men-of-war at sunset on the 22nd February 1797; and, on
the appearance of Lord Cawdor with the local Yeomanry and Militia, asked to be allowed to surrender
on the 24th. At a subsequent exchange of prisoners the French authorities refused to receive
any of the worthies who had accompanied Tate. At length 512 were allowed to land; but were
imprisoned in the forts of Cherbourg. The French records contain many expressions of the dread
experienced by the inhabitants of the coast lest the English should put on shore in France
the malefactors whom they had captured at Fishguard.

A more promising enterprise was that in which it was decided to obtain the assistance of the
Dutch, at the time in possession of a considerable fleet. The Dutch fleet was to put to sea
with the object of engaging the English. An army of 15,000 was then to be embarked in the ports
of Holland, and was to effect a diversion in favour of another and larger body, which, starting
from France, was to land in Ireland, repeating the attempt of Hoche in December 1796, which
will be dealt with later on. The enterprise was frustrated by the action of Admiral Duncan,
who decisively defeated the Dutch fleet off Camperdown in October. It might have been supposed
that this would have driven home the lesson that no considerable military expedition across
the water has any chance of success till the country sending it has obtained command of the
sea; but it did not. To Bonaparte the event was full of meaning; but no other French soldier
seems to have learned it--if we may take Captain Desbrière's views as representative--even
down to the present day. On the 23rd February 1798 Bonaparte wrote: 'Opérer une descente en
Angleterre sans être maître de la mer est l'opération la plus hardie et la plus difficile qui
ait été faite.' There has been much speculation as to the reasons which induced Bonaparte to
quit the command of the 'Army of England' after holding it but a short time, and after having
devoted great attention to its organisation and proposed methods of transport across the Channel.
The question is less difficult than it has appeared to be to many. One of the foremost men
in France, Bonaparte was ready to take the lead in any undertaking which seemed likely to have
a satisfactory ending--an ending which would redound to the glory of the chief who conducted
it. The most important operation contemplated was the invasion of England; and--now that Hoche
was no more--Bonaparte might well claim to lead it. His penetrating insight soon enabled him
to see its impracticability until the French had won the command of the Channel. Of that there
was not much likelihood; and at the first favourable moment he dissociated himself from all
connection with an enterprise which offered so little promise of a successful termination that
it was all but certain not to be begun. An essential condition, as already pointed out, of
all the projected invasions was the receipt of assistance from sympathisers in the enemy's
country. Hoche himself expected this even in Tate's case; but experience proved the expectation
to be baseless. When the prisoners taken with Tate were being conducted to their place of confinement,
the difficulty was to protect them, 'car la population furieuse contre les Français voulait
les lyncher.' Captain Desbrière dwells at some length on the mutinies in the British fleet
in 1797, and asks regretfully, 'Qu'avait-on fait pour profiter de cette chance unique?' He
remarks on the undoubted and really lamentable fact that English historians have usually paid
insufficient attention to these occurrences. One, and perhaps the principal reason of their
silence, was the difficulty, at all events till quite lately, of getting materials with which
to compose a narrative. The result is that the real character of the great mutinies has been
altogether misunderstood. Lord Camperdown's recently published life of his great ancestor,
Lord Duncan, has done something to put them in their right light. As regards defence against
the enemy, the mutinies affected the security of the country very little. The seamen always
expressed their determination to do their duty if the enemy put to sea. Even at the Nore they
conspicuously displayed their general loyalty; and, as a matter of fact, discipline had regained
its sway some time before the expedition preparing in Holland was ready. How effectively the
crews of the ships not long before involved in the mutiny could fight, was proved at Camperdown.

Though earlier in date than the events just discussed, the celebrated first expedition to Ireland
has been intentionally left out of consideration till now. As to the general features of the
undertaking, and even some of its more important details, the documents now published add little
to our knowledge. The literature of the expedition is large, and Captain Chevalier had given
us an admirable account of it in his 'Histoire de la Marine Française sous la première République.'
The late Vice-Admiral Colomb submitted it to a most instructive examination in the Journalofthe
RoyalUnitedServiceInstitution for January 1892. We can, however, learn something from Captain
Desbrière's collection. The perusal suggests, or indeed compels, the conclusion that the expedition
was doomed to failure from the start. It had no money, stores, or means of transport. There
was no hope of finding these in a country like the south-western corner of Ireland. Grouchy's
decision not to land the troops who had reached Bantry Bay was no doubt dictated in reality
by a perception of this; and by the discovery that, even if he got on shore, sympathisers with
him would be practically non-existent. On reading the letters now made public, one is convinced
of Hoche's unfitness for the leadership of such an enterprise. The adoration of mediocrities
is confined to no one cult and to no one age. Hoche's canonisation, for he is a prominent saint
in the Republican calendar, was due not so much to what he did as to what he did not do. He
did not hold the supreme command in La Vendée till the most trying period of the war was past.
He did not continue the cruelties of the Jacobin emissaries in the disturbed districts; but
then his pacificatory measures were taken when the spirit of ferocity which caused the horrors
of the noyades and of the Terror had, even amongst the mob of Paris, burnt itself out. He did
not overthrow a constitutional Government and enslave his country as Bonaparte did; and, therefore,
he is favourably compared with the latter, whose opportunities he did not have. His letters
show him to have been an adept in the art of traducing colleagues behind their backs. In writing
he called Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse 'perfide,' and spoke of his 'mauvaise foi.' He had a low
opinion of General Humbert, whom he bracketed with Mascheret. Grouchy, he said, was 'un inconséquent
paperassier,' and General Vaillant 'un misérable ivrogne.' He was placed in supreme command
of the naval as well as of the military forces, and was allowed to select the commander of
the former. Yet he and his nominee were amongst the small fraction of the expeditionary body
which never reached a place where disembarkation was possible.

Notwithstanding all this, the greater part of the fleet, and of the troops conveyed by it,
did anchor in Bantry Bay without encountering an English man-of-war; and a large proportion
continued in the Bay, unmolested by our navy, for more than a fortnight. Is not this, it may
be asked, a sufficient refutation of those who hold that command of the sea gives security
against invasion? As a matter of fact, command of the sea--even in the case in question--did
prevent invasion from being undertaken, still more from being carried through, on a scale likely
to be very formidable. The total number of troops embarked was under 14,000, of whom 633 were
lost, owing to steps taken to avoid the hostile navy, before the expedition had got fully under
way. It is not necessary to rate Hoche's capacity very highly in order to understand that he,
who had seen something of war on a grand scale, would not have committed himself to the command
of so small a body, without cavalry, without means of transport on land, without supplies,
with but an insignificant artillery and that not furnished with horses, and, as was avowed,
without hope of subsequent reinforcement or of open communications with its base--that he would
not have staked his reputation on the fate of a body so conditioned, if he had been permitted
by the naval conditions of the case to lead a larger, more effectually organised, and better
supplied army. The commentary supplied by Captain Desbrière to the volume under notice discloses
his opinion that the failure of the expedition to Ireland was due to the inefficiency of the
French Navy. He endeavours to be scrupulously fair to his naval fellow-countrymen; but his
conviction is apparent. It hardly admits of doubt that this view has generally been, and still
is, prevalent in the French Army. Foreign soldiers of talent and experience generalise from
this as follows: Let them but have the direction of the naval as well as of the military part
of an expedition, and the invasion of England must be successful. The complete direction which
they would like is exactly what Hoche did have. He chose the commander of the fleet, and also
chose or regulated the choice of the junior flag officers and several of the captains. Admiral
Morard de Galles was not, and did not consider himself, equal to the task for which Hoche's
favour had selected him. His letter pointing out his own disqualifications has a striking resemblance
to the one written by Medina Sidonia in deprecation of his appointment in place of Santa Cruz.
Nevertheless, the French naval officers did succeed in conveying the greater part of the expeditionary
army to a point at which disembarkation was practicable.

Now we have some lessons to learn from this. The advantages conferred by command of the sea
must be utilised intelligently; and it was bad management which permitted an important anchorage
to remain for more than a fortnight in the hands of an invading force. We need not impute to
our neighbours a burning desire to invade us; but it is a becoming exercise of ordinary strategic
precaution to contemplate preparations for repelling what, as a mere military problem, they
consider still feasible. No amount of naval superiority will ever ensure every part of our
coast against incursions like that of Tate and his gaol-birds. Naval superiority, however,
will put in our hands the power of preventing the arrival of an army strong enough to carry
out a real invasion. The strength of such an army will largely depend upon the amount of mobile
land force of which we can dispose. Consequently, defence against invasion, even of an island,
is the duty of a land army as well as of a fleet. The more important part may, in our case,
be that of the latter; but the services of the former cannot be dispensed with. The best method
of utilising those services calls for much thought. In 1798, when the 'First Army of England'
menaced us from the southern coast of the Channel, it was reported to our Government that an
examination of the plans formerly adopted for frustrating intended invasions showed the advantage
of troubling the enemy in his own home and not waiting till he had come to injure us in ours.

OVER-SEA RAIDS AND RAIDS ON LAND[64]

[Footnote 64: Written in 1906. (TheMorningPost.)]

It has been contended that raids by 'armaments with 1000, 20,000, and 50,000 men on board respectively'
have succeeded in evading 'our watching and chasing fleets,' and that consequently invasion
of the British Isles on a great scale is not only possible but fairly practicable, British
naval predominance notwithstanding. I dispute the accuracy of the history involved in the allusions
to the above-stated figures. The number of men comprised in a raiding or invading expedition
is the number that is or can be put on shore. The crews of the transports are not included
in it. In the cases alluded to, Humbert's expedition was to have numbered 82 officers and 1017
other ranks, and 984 were put on shore in Killala Bay. Though the round number, 1000, represents
this figure fairly enough, there was a 10 per cent. shrinkage from the original embarkation
strength. In Hoche's expedition the total number of troops embarked was under 14,000, of whom
633 were lost before the expedition had got clear of its port of starting, and of the remainder
only a portion reached Ireland. General Bonaparte landed in Egypt not 50,000 men, but about
36,000. In the expeditions of Hoche and Humbert it was not expected that the force to be landed
would suffice of itself, the belief being that it would be joined in each case by a large body
of adherents in the raided country. Outside the ranks of the 'extremists of the dinghy school'--whose
number is unknown and is almost certainly quite insignificant--no one asserts or ever has asserted
that raids in moderate strength are not possible even in the face of a strong defending navy.
It is a fact that the whole of our defence policy for many generations has been based upon
an admission of their possibility. Captain Mahan's statement of the case has never been questioned
by anyone of importance. Students of Clausewitz may be expected to remember that the art of
war does not consist in making raids that are unsuccessful; that war is waged to gain certain
great objects; and that the course of hostilities between two powerful antagonists is affected
little one way or the other by raids even on a considerable scale.

The Egyptian expedition of 1798 deserves fuller treatment than it has generally received. The
preparations at Toulon and some Italian ports were known to the British Government. It being
impossible for even a Moltke or--comparative resources being taken into account--the greater
strategist Kodama to know everything in the mind of an opponent, the sensible proceeding is
to guard against his doing what would be likely to do you most harm. The British Government
had reason to believe that the Toulon expedition was intended to reinforce at an Atlantic port
another expedition to be directed against the British Isles, or to effect a landing in Spain
with a view to marching into Portugal and depriving our navy of the use of Lisbon. Either if
effected would probably cause us serious mischief, and arrangements were made to prevent them.
A landing in Egypt was, as the event showed, of little importance. The threat conveyed by it
against our Indian possessions proved to be an empty one. Upwards of 30,000 hostile troops
were locked up in a country from which they could exercise no influence on the general course
of the war, and in which in the end they had to capitulate. Suppose that an expedition crossing
the North Sea with the object of invading this country had to content itself with a landing
in Iceland, having eventual capitulation before it, should we not consider ourselves very fortunate,
though it may have temporarily occupied one of the Shetland Isles enroute? The truth of the
matter is that the Egyptian expedition was one of the gravest of strategical mistakes, and
but for the marvellous subsequent achievements of Napoleon it would have been the typical example
of bad strategy adduced by lecturers and writers on the art of war for the warning of students.

The supposition that over-sea raids, even when successful in part, in any way demonstrate the
inefficiency of naval defence would never be admitted if only land and sea warfare were regarded
as branches of one whole and not as quite distinct things. To be consistent, those that admit
the supposition should also admit that the practicability of raids demonstrates still more
conclusively the insufficiency of defence by an army. An eminent military writer has told us
that 'a raiding party of 1000 French landed in Ireland without opposition, after sixteen days
of navigation, unobserved by the British Navy; defeated and drove back the British troops opposing
them on four separate occasions... entirely occupied the attention of all the available troops
of a garrison of Ireland 100,000 strong; penetrated almost to the centre of the island, and
compelled the Lord-Lieutenant to send an urgent requisition for "as great a reinforcement as
possible."' If an inference is to be drawn from this in the same way as one has been drawn
from the circumstances on the sea, it would follow that one hundred thousand troops are not
sufficient to prevent a raid by one thousand, and consequently that one million troops would
not be sufficient to prevent one by ten thousand enemies. On this there would arise the question,
If an army a million strong gives no security against a raid by ten thousand men, is an army
worth having? And this question, be it noted, would come, not from disciples of the Blue Water
School, 'extremist' or other, but from students of military narrative.

The truth is that raids are far more common on land than on the ocean. For every one of the
latter it would be possible to adduce several of the former. Indeed, accounts of raids are
amongst the common-places of military history. There are few campaigns since the time of that
smart cavalry leader Mago, the younger brother of Hannibal, in which raids on land did not
occur or in which they exercised any decisive influence on the issue of hostilities. It is
only the failure to see the connection between warfare on land and naval warfare that prevents
these land raids being given the same significance and importance that is usually given to
those carried out across the sea.

In the year 1809, the year of Wagram, Napoleon's military influence in Central Germany was,
to say the least, not at its lowest. Yet Colonel Schill, of the Prussian cavalry, with 1200
men, subsequently increased to 2000 infantry and 12 squadrons, proceeded to Wittenberg, thence
to Magdeburg, and next to Stralsund, which he occupied and where he met his death in opposing
an assault made by 6000 French troops. He had defied for a month all the efforts of a large
army to suppress him. In the same year the Duke of Brunswick-Oels and Colonel Dornberg, notwithstanding
the smallness of the force under them, by their action positively induced Napoleon, only a
few weeks before Wagram, to detach the whole corps of Kellerman, 30,000 strong, which otherwise
would have been called up to the support of the Grande Armée, to the region in which these
enterprising raiders were operating. The mileage covered by Schill was nearly as great as that
covered by the part of Hoche's expedition which under Grouchy did reach an Irish port, though
it was not landed. Instances of cavalry raids were frequent in the War of Secession in America.
The Federal Colonel B. H. Grierson, of the 6th Illinois Cavalry, with another Illinois and
an Iowa cavalry regiment, in April 1863 made a raid which lasted sixteen days, and in which
he covered 600 miles of hostile country, finally reaching Baton Rouge, where a friendly force
was stationed. The Confederate officers, John H. Morgan, John S. Mosby, and especially N. B.
Forrest, were famous for the extent and daring of their raids. Of all the leaders of important
raids in the War of Secession none surpassed the great Confederate cavalry General, J. E. B.
Stuart, whose riding right round the imposing Federal army is well known. Yet not one of the
raids above mentioned had any effect on the main course of the war in which they occurred or
on the result of the great conflict.

In the last war the case was the same. In January 1905, General Mischenko with 10,000 sabres
and three batteries of artillery marched right round the flank of Marshal Oyama's great Japanese
army, and occupied Niu-chwang--not the treaty port so-called, but a place not very far from
it. For several days he was unmolested, and in about a week he got back to his friends with
a loss which was moderate in proportion to his numbers. In the following May Mischenko made
another raid, this time round General Nogi's flank. He had with him fifty squadrons, a horse
artillery battery, and a battery of machine guns. Starting on the 17th, he was discovered on
the 18th, came in contact with his enemy on the 19th, but met with no considerable hostile
force till the 20th, when the Japanese cavalry arrived just in time to collide with the Russian
rearguard of two squadrons. On this General Mischenko 'retired at his ease for some thirty
miles along the Japanese flank and perhaps fifteen miles away from it.' These Russians' raids
did not alter the course of the war nor bring ultimate victory to their standards.

It would be considered by every military authority as a flagrant absurdity to deduce from the
history of these many raids on land that a strong army is not a sufficient defence for a continental
country against invasion. What other efficient defence against that can a continental country
have? Apply the reasoning to the case of an insular country, and reliance on naval defence
will be abundantly justified.

To maintain that Canada, India, and Egypt respectively could be invaded by the United States,
Russia, and Turkey, backed by Germany, notwithstanding any action that our navy could take,
would be equivalent to maintaining that one part of our empire cannot or need not reinforce
another. Suppose that we had a military force numerically equal to or exceeding the Russian,
how could any of it be sent to defend Canada, India, and Egypt, or to reinforce the defenders
of those countries, unless our sea communications were kept open? Can these be kept open except
by the action of our navy? It is plain that they cannot.

VIII

QUEEN ELIZABETH AND HER SEAMEN[65]

[Footnote 65: Written in 1900. (NineteenthCenturyandAfter, 1901.)]

An eminent writer has recently repeated the accusations made within the last forty years, and
apparently only within that period, against Queen Elizabeth of having starved the seamen of
her fleet by giving them food insufficient in quantity and bad in quality, and of having robbed
them by keeping them out of the pay due to them. He also accuses the Queen, though somewhat
less plainly, of having deliberately acquiesced in a wholesale slaughter of her seamen by remaining
still, though no adequate provision had been made for the care of the sick and wounded. There
are further charges of obstinately objecting, out of mere stinginess, to take proper measures
for the naval defence of the country, and of withholding a sufficient supply of ammunition
from her ships when about to meet the enemy. Lest it should be supposed that this is an exaggerated
statement of the case against Elizabeth as formulated by the writer in question, his own words
are given.

He says: 'Instead of strengthening her armaments to the utmost, and throwing herself upon her
Parliament for aid, she clung to her moneybags, actually reduced her fleet, withheld ammunition
and the more necessary stores, cut off the sailor's food, did, in short, everything in her
power to expose the country defenceless to the enemy. The pursuit of the Armada was stopped
by the failure of the ammunition, which, apparently, had the fighting continued longer, would
have been fatal to the English fleet.'

The writer makes on this the rather mild comment that 'treason itself could scarcely have done
worse.' Why 'scarcely'? Surely the very blackest treason could not have done worse. He goes
on to ask: 'How were the glorious seamen, whose memory will be for ever honoured by England
and the world, rewarded after their victory?'

This is his answer: 'Their wages were left unpaid, they were docked of their food, and served
with poisonous drink, while for the sick and wounded no hospitals were provided. More of them
were killed by the Queen's meanness than by the enemy.'

It is safe to challenge the students of history throughout the world to produce any parallel
to conduct so infamous as that which has thus been imputed to an English queen. If the charges
are true, there is no limit to the horror and loathing with which we ought to regard Elizabeth.
Are they true? That is the question. I respectfully invite the attention of those who wish
to know the truth and to retain their reverence for a great historical character, to the following
examination of the accusations and of the foundations on which they rest. It will not, I hope,
be considered presumptuous if I say that--in making this examination--personal experience of
life in the navy sufficiently extensive to embrace both the present day and the time before
the introduction of the great modern changes in system and naval matériel will be of great
help. Many things which have appeared so extraordinary to landsmen that they could account
for their occurrence only by assuming that this must have been due to extreme culpability or
extreme folly will be quite familiar to naval officers whose experience of the service goes
back forty years or more, and can be satisfactorily explained by them.

There is little reason to doubt that the above-mentioned charges against the great Queen are
based exclusively on statements in Froude's History. It is remarkable how closely Froude has
been followed by writers treating of Elizabeth and her reign. He was known to have gone to
original documents for the sources of his narrative; and it seems to have been taken for granted,
not only that his fidelity was above suspicion--an assumption with which I do not deal now--but
also that his interpretation of the meaning of those who wrote the papers consulted must be
correct. Motley, in his 'History of the United Netherlands,' published in 1860, had dwelt upon
the shortness of ammunition and provisions in the Channel Fleet commanded by Lord Howard of
Effingham; but he attributed this to bad management on the part of officials, and not to downright
baseness on that of Elizabeth.

Froude has placed beyond doubt his determination to make the Queen responsible for all shortcomings.

'The Queen,' he says, 'has taken upon herself the detailed arrangement of everything. She and
she alone was responsible. She had extended to the dockyards the same hard thrift with which
she had pared down her expenses everywhere. She tied the ships to harbour by supplying the
stores in driblets. She allowed rations but for a month, and permitted no reserves to be provided
in the victualling offices. The ships at Plymouth, furnished from a distance, and with small
quantities at a time, were often for many days without food of any kind. Even at Plymouth,
short food and poisonous drink had brought dysentery among them. They had to meet the enemy,
as it were, with one arm bandaged by their own sovereign. The greatest service ever done by
an English fleet had been thus successfully accomplished by men whose wages had not been paid
from the time of their engagement, half-starved, with their clothes in rags, and so ill-found
in the necessaries of war that they had eked out their ammunition by what they could take in
action from the enemy himself. The men expected that at least after such a service they would
be paid their wages in full. The Queen was cavilling over the accounts, and would give no orders
for money till she had demanded the meaning of every penny that she was charged.... Their legitimate
food had been stolen from them by the Queen's own neglect.'

We thus see that Froude has made Elizabeth personally responsible for the short rations, the
undue delay in paying wages earned, and the fearful sickness which produced a heavy mortality
amongst the crews of her Channel Fleet; and also for insufficiently supplying her ships with
ammunition.

The quotations from the book previously referred to make it clear that it is possible to outdo
Froude in his denunciations, even where it is on his statements that the accusers found their
charges. In his 'History of England'--which is widely read, especially by the younger generation
of Englishmen--the Rev. J. Franck Bright tells us, with regard to the defensive campaign against
the Armada: 'The Queen's avarice went near to ruin the country. The miserable supplies which
Elizabeth had alone allowed to be sent them (the ships in the Channel) had produced all sorts
of disease, and thousands of the crews came from their great victory only to die. In his sketch
of her life in the 'Dictionary of National Biography,' Dr. Augustus Jessopp asserts that the
Queen's ships 'were notoriously and scandalously ill-furnished with stores and provisions for
the sailors, and it is impossible to lay the blame on anyone but the Queen.' He had previously
remarked that the merchant vessels which came to the assistance of the men-of-war from London
and the smaller ports 'were as a rule far better furnished than the Queen's ships,' which were
'without the barest necessaries.' After these extracts one from Dr. S. R. Gardiner's 'Student's
History of England' will appear moderate. Here it is: 'Elizabeth having with her usual economy
kept the ships short of powder, they were forced to come back' from the chase of the Armada.

The above allegations constitute a heavy indictment of the Queen. No heavier could well be
brought against any sovereign or government. Probably the first thing that occurs to anyone
who, knowing what Elizabeth's position was, reads the tremendous charges made against her will
be, that--if they are true--she must have been without a rival in stupidity as well as in turpitude.
There was no person in the world who had as much cause to desire the defeat of the Armada as
she had. If the Duke of Medina Sidonia's expedition had been successful she would have lost
both her throne and her life. She herself and her father had shown that there could be a short
way with Queens--consort or regnant--whom you had in your power, and whose existence might
be inconvenient to you. Yet, if we are to believe her accusers, she did her best to ensure
her own dethronement and decapitation. 'The country saved itself and its cause in spite of
its Queen.'

How did this extraordinary view of Elizabeth's conduct arise? What had Froude to go upon when
he came forward as her accuser? These questions can be answered with ease. Every Government
that comes near going to war, or that has gone to war, is sure to incur one of two charges,
made according to circumstances. If the Government prepares for war and yet peace is preserved,
it is accused of unpardonable extravagance in making preparations. Whether it makes these on
a sufficient scale or not, it is accused, if war does break out--at least in the earlier period
of the contest--of not having done enough. Political opponents and the 'man in the street'
agree in charging the administration with panic profusion in one case, and with criminal niggardliness
in the other. Elizabeth hoped to preserve peace. She had succeeded in keeping out of an 'official'
war for a long time, and she had much justification for the belief that she could do so still
longer. 'She could not be thoroughly persuaded,' says Mr. David Hannay,[66] 'that it was hopeless
to expect to avert the Spanish invasion by artful diplomacy.' Whilst reasonable precautions
were not neglected, she was determined that no one should be able to say with truth that she
had needlessly thrown away money in a fright. For the general naval policy of England at the
time, Elizabeth, as both the nominal and the real head of the Government, is properly held
responsible. The event showed the perfect efficiency of that policy.

[Footnote 66: AShortHistoryoftheRoyalNavy, pp. 96, 97.]

The war having really come, it was inevitable that the Government, and Elizabeth as its head,
should be blamed sooner or later for not having made adequate provision for it. No one is better
entitled to speak on the naval policy of the Armada epoch than Mr. Julian Corbett,[67] who
is not disposed to assume that the Queen's action was above criticism. He says that 'Elizabeth
has usually been regarded as guilty of complete and unpardonable inaction.' He explains that
'the event at least justified the Queen's policy. There is no trace of her having been blamed
for it at the time at home; nor is there any reason to doubt it was adopted sagaciously and
deliberately on the advice of her most capable officers.' Mr. David Hannay, who, as an historian,
rightly takes into consideration the conditions of the age, points out that 'Elizabeth was
a very poor sovereign, and the maintenance of a great fleet was a heavy drain upon her resources.'
He adds: 'There is no reason to suppose that Elizabeth and her Lord Treasurer were careless
of their duty; but the Government of the time had very little experience in the maintenance
of great military forces.'

[Footnote 67: DrakeandtheTudorNavy, 1898, vol. ii. p. 117.]

If we take the charges against her in detail, we shall find that each is as ill-founded as
that of criminal neglect of naval preparations generally. The most serious accusation is that
with regard to the victuals. It will most likely be a surprise to many people to find that
the seamen of Elizabeth were victualled on a more abundant and much more costly scale than
the seamen of Victoria. Nevertheless, such is the fact. In 1565 the contract allowance for
victualling was 4-1/2d. a day for each man in harbour, and 5d. a day at sea. There was also
an allowance of 4d. a man per month at sea and 8d. in harbour for 'purser's necessaries.' Mr.
Oppenheim, in whose valuable work[68] on naval administration the details as to the Elizabethan
victualling system are to be found, tells us that in 1586 the rate was raised to 6d. a day
in harbour and 6-1/2d. at sea; and that in 1587 it was again raised, this time to 6-1/2d. in
harbour and 7d. at sea. These sums were intended to cover both the cost of the food and storage,
custody, conveyance, &c., the present-day 'establishment charges.' The repeated raising of
the money allowance is convincing proof that the victualling arrangements had not been neglected,
and that there was no refusal to sanction increased expenditure to improve them. It is a great
thing to have Mr. Oppenheim's high authority for this, because he is not generally favourable
to the Queen, though even he admits that it 'is a moot point' how far she was herself responsible.

[Footnote 68: TheAdministrationoftheRoyalNavy, 1509-1660. London, 1896.]

If necessary, detailed arguments could be adduced to show that to get the present value of
the sums allowed in 1588 we ought to multiply them by six[69] The sum allowed for each man's
daily food and the 'establishment charges'--increased as they had been in 1586--did little
more than cover the expenditure; and, though it does not appear that the contractor lost money,
he nevertheless died a poor man. It will be hardly imputed to Elizabeth for iniquity that she
did not consider that the end of government was the enrichment of contractors. The fact that
she increased the money payment again in 1587 may be accepted as proof that she did not object
to a fair bargain. As has been just said, the Elizabethan scale of victualling was more abundant
than the early Victorian, and not less abundant than that given in the earlier years of King
Edward VII.[70] As shown by Mr. Hubert Hall and Thorold Rogers, in the price-lists which they
publish, the cost of a week's allowance of food for a man-of-war's man in 1588, in the money
of the time, amounted to about 1s. 11-1/2d., which, multiplied by six, would be about 11s.
9d. of our present money. The so-called 'savings price' of the early twentieth century allowance
was about 9-1/2d. a day, or 5s. 6-1/2d. weekly. The 'savings price' is the amount of money
which a man received if he did not take up his victuals, each article having a price attached
to it for that purpose. It may be interesting to know that the full allowance was rarely, perhaps
never, taken up, and that some part of the savings was till the last, and for many years had
been, almost invariably paid.

[Footnote 69: See Mr. Hubert Hall's SocietyintheElizabethan Age, and Thorold Rogers's HistoryofAgricultureandPrices,
vols. v. and vi. Froude himself puts the ratio at six to one.]

[Footnote 70: It will be convenient to compare the two scales in a footnote, observing that--as
I hope will not be thought impertinent--I draw on my own personal experience for the more recent,
which was in force for some years after I went to sea.

There is now a small allowance of oatmeal, pepper, mustard, and vinegar, against which we may
set the 'purser's necessaries' of Elizabeth's day. In that day but little sugar was used, and
tea and cocoa were unknown even in palaces. It is just a question if seven gallons of beer
did not make up for the weekly allowance of these and for the seven-eighths of a pint of spirits.
Tea was only allowed in 1850, and was not an additional article. It replaced part of the spirits.
The biscuit allowance is now 8-3/4 lbs. Weekly.

The Victorian dietary is more varied and wholesome than the Elizabethan; but, as we have seen,
it is less abundant and can be obtained for much less money, even if we grant that the 'savings
price'--purposely kept low to avoid all suggestion that the men are being bribed into stinting
themselves--is less than the real cost. The excess of this latter, however, is not likely to
be more than 30 per cent., so that Elizabeth's expenditure in this department was more liberal
than the present. Such defects as were to be found in the Elizabethan naval dietary were common
to it with that of the English people generally. If there was plenty, there was but little
variety in the food of our ancestors of all ranks three centuries ago. As far as was possible
in the conditions of the time, Elizabeth's Government did make provision for victualling the
fleet on a sufficient and even liberal scale; and, notwithstanding slender pecuniary resources,
repeatedly increased the money assigned to it, on cause being shown. In his eagerness to make
Queen Elizabeth a monster of treacherous rapacity, Froude has completely overreached himself,
He says that 'she permitted some miserable scoundrel to lay a plan before her for saving expense,
by cutting down the seamen's diet.' The 'miserable scoundrel' had submitted a proposal for
diminishing the expenses which the administration was certainly ill able to bear, The candid
reader will draw his own conclusions when he finds that the Queen did not approve the plan
submitted; and yet that not one of her assailants has let this appear.[71]

[Footnote 71: It may be stated here that the word 'rations' is unknown in the navy. The official
term is 'victuals.' The term in common use is 'provisions.']

It is, of course, possible to concede that adequate arrangements had been made for the general
victualling of the fleet; and still to maintain that, after all, the sailors afloat actually
did run short of food. In his striking 'Introduction to the Armada Despatches' published by
the Navy Records Society, Professor Sir John Laughton declares that: 'To anyone examining the
evidence, there can be no question as to victualling being conducted on a fairly liberal scale,
as far as the money was concerned. It was in providing the victuals that the difficulty lay....
When a fleet of unprecedented magnitude was collected, when a sudden and unwonted demand was
made on the victualling officers, it would have been strange indeed if things had gone quite
smoothly.'

There are plenty of naval officers who have had experience, and within the last ten years of
the nineteenth century, of the difficulty, and sometimes of the impossibility, of getting sufficient
supplies for a large number of ships in rather out-of-the-way places. In 1588 the comparative
thinness of population and insufficiency of communications and means of transport must have
constituted obstacles, far greater than any encountered in our own day, to the collection of
supplies locally and to their timely importation from a distance. 'You would not believe,'
says Lord Howard of Effingham himself, 'what a wonderful thing it is to victual such an army
as this is in such a narrow corner of the earth, where a man would think that neither victuals
were to be had nor a cask to put it in.' No more effective defence of Elizabeth and her Ministers
could well be advanced than that which Mr. Oppenheim puts forward as a corroboration of the
accusation against them. He says that the victualling officials 'found no difficulty in arranging
for 13,000 men in 1596 and 9200 in 1597 after timely notice.' This is really a high compliment,
as it proves that the authorities were quite ready to, and in fact did, learn from experience.
Mr. Oppenheim, however, is not an undiscriminating assailant of the Queen; for he remarks,
as has been already said, that, 'how far Elizabeth was herself answerable is a moot point.'
He tells us that there 'is no direct evidence against her'; and the charge levelled at her
rests not on proof, but on 'strong probability.' One would like to have another instance out
of all history, of probability, however strong, being deemed sufficient to convict a person
of unsurpassed treachery and stupidity combined, when the direct evidence, which is not scanty,
fails to support the charge and indeed points the other way.

The Lord Admiral himself and other officers have been quoted to show how badly off the fleet
was for food. Yet at the close of the active operations against the Armada, Sir J. Hawkins
wrote: 'Here is victual sufficient, and I know not why any should be provided after September,
but for those which my Lord doth mean to leave in the narrow seas.' On the same day Howard
himself wrote from Dover: 'I have caused all the remains of victuals to be laid here and at
Sandwich, for the maintaining of them that shall remain in the Narrow Seas.' Any naval officer
with experience of command who reads Howard's representations on the subject of the victuals
will at once perceive that what the Admiral was anxious about was not the quantity on board
the ships, but the stock in reserve. Howard thought that the latter ought to be a supply for
six weeks. The Council thought a month's stock would be enough; and--as shown by the extracts
from Howard's and Hawkins's letters just given--the Council was right in its estimate. Anyone
who has had to write or to read official letters about stocks of stores and provisions will
find something especially modern in Howard's representations.

Though the crews of the fleet did certainly come near the end of their victuals afloat, there
is no case of their having actually run out of them. The complement of an ordinary man-of-war
in the latter part of the sixteenth century, judged by our modern standard, was very large
in proportion to her size. It was impossible for her to carry provisions enough to last her
men for a long time. Any unexpected prolongation of a cruise threatened a reduction to short
commons. A great deal has been made of the fact that Howard had to oblige six men to put up
with the allowance of four. 'When a large force,' says Mr. D. Hannay, 'was collected for service
during any length of time, it was the common rule to divide four men's allowance among six.'
There must be still many officers and men to whom the plan would seem quite familiar. It is
indicated by a recognised form of words, 'six upon four.' I have myself been 'six upon four'
several times, mostly in the Pacific, but also, on at least one occasion, in the East Indies.
As far as I could see, no one appeared to regard it as an intolerable hardship. The Government,
it should be known, made no profit out of the process, because money was substituted for the
food not issued. Howard's recourse to it was not due to immediate insufficiency. Speaking of
the merchant vessels which came to reinforce him, he says: 'We are fain to help them with victuals
to bring them thither. There is not any of them that hath one day's victuals.' These merchant
vessels were supplied by private owners; and it is worth noting that, in the teeth of this
statement by Howard, Dr. Jessopp, in his eagerness to blacken Elizabeth, says that they 'were,
as a rule, far better furnished than the Queen's ships.' The Lord Admiral on another occasion,
before the fight off Gravelines, said of the ships he hoped would join him from Portsmouth:
'Though they have not two days' victuals, let that not be the cause of their stay, for they
shall have victuals out of our fleet,' a conclusive proof that his ships were not very short.

As to the accusation of deliberately issuing food of bad quality, that is effectually disposed
of by the explanation already given of the method employed in victualling the navy. A sum was
paid for each man's daily allowance to a contractor, who was expressly bound to furnish 'good
and seasonable victuals.'[72] Professor Laughton, whose competence in the matter is universally
allowed, informs us that complaints of bad provisions are by no means confined to the Armada
epoch, and were due, not to intentional dishonesty and neglect, but to insufficient knowledge
of the way to preserve provisions for use on rather long cruises. Mr. Hannay says that the
fleet sent to the coast of Spain, in the year after the defeat of the Armada, suffered much
from want of food and sickness. 'Yet it was organised, not by the Queen, but by a committee
of adventurers who had every motive to fit it out well.' It is the fashion with English historians
to paint the condition of the navy in the time of the Commonwealth in glowing colours, yet
Mr. Oppenheim cites many occasions of well-founded complaints of the victuals. He says: 'The
quality of the food supplied to the men and the honesty of the victualling agents both steadily
deteriorated during the Commonwealth.' Lord Howard's principal difficulty was with the beer,
which would go sour. The beer was the most frequent subject of protest in the Commonwealth
times. Also, in 1759, Lord (then Sir Edward) Hawke reported: 'Our daily employment is condemning
the beer from Plymouth.' The difficulty of brewing beer that would stand a sea voyage seemed
to be insuperable. The authorities, however, did not soon abandon attempts to get the right
article. Complaints continued to pour in; but they went on with their brewing till 1835, and
then gave it up as hopeless.

[Footnote 72: See 'The Mariners of England before the Armada,' by Mr. H. Halliday Sparling,
in the EnglishIllustratedMagazine, July 1, 1891.]

One must have had personal experience of the change to enable one to recognise the advance
that has been made in the art of preserving articles of food within the last half-century.
In the first Drury Lane pantomime that I can remember--about a year before I went to sea--a
practical illustration of the quality of some of the food supplied to the navy was offered
during the harlequinade by the clown, who satisfied his curiosity as to the contents of a large
tin of 'preserved meat' by pulling out a dead cat. On joining the service I soon learned that,
owing to the badness of the 'preserved' food that had been supplied, the idea of issuing tinned
meat had been abandoned. It was not resumed till some years later. It is often made a joke
against naval officers of a certain age that, before eating a biscuit, they have a trick of
rapping the table with it. We contracted the habit as midshipmen when it was necessary to get
rid of the weevils in the biscuit before it could be eaten, and a fairly long experience taught
us that rapping the table with it was an effectual plan for expelling them.

There is no more justification for accusing Queen Elizabeth of failure to provide well-preserved
food to her sailors than there is for accusing her of not having sent supplies to Plymouth
by railway. Steam transport and efficient food preservation were equally unknown in her reign
and for long after. It has been intimated above that, even had she wished to, she could not
possibly have made any money out of bad provisions. The victualling system did not permit of
her doing so. The austere republican virtue of the Commonwealth authorities enabled them to
do what was out of Elizabeth's power. In 1653, 'beer and other provisions "decayed and unfit
for use" were licensed for export free of Customs.' Mr. Oppenheim, who reports this fact, makes
the remarkable comment that this was done 'perhaps in the hope that such stores would go to
Holland,' with whose people we were at war. As the heavy mortality in the navy had always been
ascribed to the use of bad provisions, we cannot refuse to give to the sturdy Republicans who
governed England in the seventeenth century the credit of contemplating a more insidious and
more effective method of damaging their enemy than poisoning his wells. One would like to have
it from some jurist if the sale of poisonously bad food to your enemy is disallowed by international
law.

That there was much sickness in the fleet and that many seamen died is, unfortunately, true.
If Howard's evidence is to be accepted--as it always is when it seems to tell against the Queen--it
is impossible to attribute this to the bad quality of the food then supplied. The Lord Admiral's
official report is 'that the ships of themselves be so infectious and corrupted as it is thought
to be a very plague; and we find that the fresh men that we draw into our ships are infected
one day and die the next.' The least restrained assertor of the 'poisonous' food theory does
not contend that it killed men within twenty-four hours. The Armada reached the Channel on
the 20th of July (30th, New Style). A month earlier Howard had reported that 'several men have
fallen sick and by thousands fain to be discharged'; and, after the fighting was over, he said
of the ElizabethJonas, she 'hath had a great infection in her from the beginning.' Lord Henry
Seymour, who commanded the division of the fleet stationed in the Straits of Dover, noted that
the sickness was a repetition of that of the year before, and attributed it not to bad food,
but to the weather. 'Our men,' he wrote, 'fall sick by reason of the cold nights and cold mornings
we find; and I fear me they will drop away faster than they did last year with Sir Henry Palmer,
which was thick enough.'

'The sickness,' says Professor Laughton, 'was primarily and chiefly due to infection from the
shore and ignorance or neglect of what we now know as sanitary laws.... Similar infections
continued occasionally to scourge our ships' companies, and still more frequently French and
Spanish ships' companies, till near the close of the eighteenth century.' It is not likely
that any evidence would suffice to divert from their object writers eager to hurl calumny at
a great sovereign; but a little knowledge of naval and of military history also would have
saved their readers from a belief in their accusations. In 1727 the fleet in the West Indies
commanded by Admiral Hosier, commemorated in Glover's ballad, lost ten flag officers and captains,
fifty lieutenants, and 4000 seamen. In the Seven Years' war the total number belonging to the
fleet killed in action was 1512; whilst the number that died of disease and were missing was
133,708. From 1778 to 1783, out of 515,000 men voted by Parliament for the navy, 132,623 were
'sent sick.' In the summer, 1779, the French fleet cruising at the mouth of the English Channel,
after landing 500, had still about 2000 men sick. At the beginning of autumn the number of
sick had become so great that many ships had not enough men to work them. The VilledeParis
had 560 sick, and lost 61. The Auguste had 500 sick, and lost 44. On board the Intrépide 70
died out of 529 sick. These were the worst cases; but other ships also suffered heavily.

It is, perhaps, not generally remembered till what a very late date armies and navies were
more than decimated by disease. In 1810 the House of Commons affirmed by a resolution, concerning
the Walcheren Expedition: 'That on the 19th of August a malignant disorder showed itself amongst
H.M. troops; and that on the 8th of September the number of sick amounted to upwards of 10,948
men. That of the army which embarked for service in the Scheldt sixty officers and 3900 men,
exclusive of those killed by the enemy, had died before the 1st of February last.'

In a volume of 'Military, Medical, and Surgical Essays'[73] prepared for the United States'
Sanitary Commission, and edited by Dr. Wm. A. Hammond, Surgeon-General of the U.S. Army, it
is stated that, in our Peninsular army, averaging a strength of 64,227 officers and men, the
annual rate of mortality from the 25th of December 1810 to the 25th of May 1813 was 10 per
cent. of the officers and 16 per cent. of the men. We may calculate from this that some 25,000
officers and men died. There were 22-1/2 per cent., or over 14,000, 'constantly sick.' Out
of 309,268 French soldiers sent to the Crimea in 1855-6, the number of killed and those who
died of wounds was 7500, the number who died of disease was 61,700. At the same date navies
also suffered. Dr. Stilon Mends, in his life of his father,[74] Admiral Sir William Mends,
prints a letter in which the Admiral, speaking of the cholera in the fleets at Varna, says:
'The mortality on board the Montebello, VilledeParis, Valmy (French ships), and Britannia (British)
has been terrible; the first lost 152 in three days, the second 120 in three days, the third
80 in ten days, but the last lost 50 in one night and 10 the subsequent day.' Kinglake tells
us that in the end the Britannia's loss went up to 105. With the above facts before us, we
are compelled to adopt one of two alternatives. We must either maintain that sanitary science
made no advance between 1588 and 1855, or admit that the mortality in Elizabeth's fleet became
what it was owing to ignorance of sanitary laws and not to intentional bad management. As regards
care of the sick, it is to be remembered that the establishment of naval and military hospitals
for the reception of sick soldiers and sailors is of recent date. For instance, the two great
English military hospitals, Netley and the Herbert, are only about sixty years old.

[Footnote 73: Philadelphia, 1864.]

[Footnote 74: London, 1899.]

So far from our fleet in 1588 having been ill-supplied with ammunition, it was in reality astonishingly
well equipped, considering the age. We learn from Mr. Julian Corbett,[75] that 'during the
few years immediately preceding the outbreak of the war, the Queen's navy had been entirely
re-armed with brass guns, and in the process of re-armament a great advance in simplicity had
been secured.' Froude, without seeing where the admission would land him, admits that our fleet
was more plentifully supplied than the Armada, in which, he says, 'the supply of cartridges
was singularly small. The King [Philip the Second] probably considered that a single action
would decide the struggle; and it amounted to but fifty rounds for each gun.' Our own supply
therefore exceeded fifty rounds. In his life of Vice-Admiral Lord Lyons,[76] Sir S. Eardley
Wilmot tells us that the British ships which attacked the Sebastopol forts in October 1854
'could only afford to expend seventy rounds per gun.' At the close of the nineteenth century,
the regulated allowance for guns mounted on the broadside was eighty-five rounds each. Consequently,
the Elizabethan allowance was nearly, if not quite, as much as that which our authorities,
after an experience of naval warfare during three centuries, thought sufficient. 'The full
explanation,' says Professor Laughton, 'of the want [of ammunition] seems to lie in the rapidity
of fire which has already been mentioned. The ships had the usual quantity on board; but the
expenditure was more, very many times more, than anyone could have conceived.' Mr. Julian Corbett
considers it doubtful if the ammunition, in at least one division of the fleet, was nearly
exhausted.

[Footnote 75: TheSpanishWar, 1585-87 (Navy Records Society), 1898, p. 323.]

[Footnote 76: London, 1898, p. 236.]

Exhaustion of the supply of ammunition in a single action is a common naval occurrence. The
not very decisive character of the battle of Malaga between Sir George Rooke and the Count
of Toulouse in 1704 was attributed to insufficiency of ammunition, the supply in our ships
having been depleted by what 'Mediterranean' Byng, afterwards Lord Torrington, calls the 'furious
fire' opened on Gibraltar. The Rev. Thomas Pocock, Chaplain of the Ranelagh, Byng's flag-ship
at Malaga, says:[77] 'Many of our ships went out of the line for want of ammunition.' Byng's
own opinion, as stated by the compiler of his memoirs, was, that 'it may without great vanity
be said that the English had gained a greater victory if they had been supplied with ammunition
as they ought to have been.' I myself heard the late Lord Alcester speak of the anxiety that
had been caused him by the state of his ships' magazines after the attack on the Alexandria
forts in 1882. At a still later date, Admiral Dewey in Manila Bay interrupted his attack on
the Spanish squadron to ascertain how much ammunition his ships had left. The carrying capacity
of ships being limited, rapid gun-fire in battle invariably brings with it the risk of running
short of ammunition. It did this in the nineteenth century just as much as, probably even more
than, it did in the sixteenth.

[Footnote 77: In his journal (p. 197), printed as an Appendix to MemoirsrelatingtotheLordTorrington,
edited by J. K. Laughton for the Camden Society, 1889.]

To charge Elizabeth with criminal parsimony because she insisted on every shot being 'registered
and accounted for' will be received with ridicule by naval officers. Of course every shot,
and for the matter of that every other article expended, has to be accounted for. One of the
most important duties of the gunner of a man-of-war is to keep a strict account of the expenditure
of all gunnery stores. This was more exactly done under Queen Victoria than it was under Queen
Elizabeth. Naval officers are more hostile to 'red tape' than most men, and they may lament
the vast amount of bookkeeping that modern auditors and committees of public accounts insist
upon, but they are convinced that a reasonable check on expenditure of stores is indispensable
to efficient organisation. So far from blaming Elizabeth for demanding this, they believe that
both she and Burleigh, her Lord Treasurer, were very much in advance of their age.

Another charge against her is that she defrauded her seamen of their wages. The following is
Froude's statement:--

'Want of the relief, which, if they had been paid their wages, they might have provided for
themselves had aggravated the tendencies to disease, and a frightful mortality now set in through
the entire fleet.' The word 'now' is interesting, Froude having had before him Howard's and
Seymour's letters, already quoted, showing that the appearance of the sickness was by no means
recent. Elizabeth's illiberality towards her seamen may be judged from the fact that in her
reign their pay was certainly increased once and perhaps twice.[78] In 1585 the sailor's pay
was raised from 6s. 8d. to 10s. a month. A rise of pay of 50 per cent. all at once is, I venture
to say, entirely without parallel in the navy since, and cannot well be called illiberal. The
Elizabethan 10s. would be equal to £3 in our present accounts; and, as the naval month at the
earlier date was the lunar, a sailor's yearly wages would be equal to £39 now. The year's pay
of an A.B., 'non-continuous service,' as Elizabeth's sailors were, is at the present time £24
6s. 8d. It is true that the sailor now can receive additional pay for good-conduct badges,
gunnery-training, &c., and also can look forward to that immense boon--a pension--nearly, but
thanks to Sir J. Hawkins and Drake's establishment of the 'Chatham Chest,' not quite unknown
in the sixteenth century. Compared with the rate of wages ruling on shore, Elizabeth's seamen
were paid highly. Mr. Hubert Hall states that for labourers 'the usual rate was 2d. or 3d.
a day.' Ploughmen received a shilling a week. In these cases 'board' was also given. The sailor's
pay was 5s. a week with board. Even compared with skilled labour on shore the sailor of the
Armada epoch was well paid. Thorold Rogers gives, for 1588, the wages, without board, of carpenters
and masons at 10d. and 1s. a day. A plumber's wages varied from 10-1/2d. to 1s.; but there
is one case of a plumber receiving as much as 1s. 4d., which was probably for a single day.

[Footnote 78: Mr. Halliday Sparling, in the article already referred to (p. 651), says twice;
but Mr. Oppenheim seems to think that the first increase was before Elizabeth's accession.]

Delay in the payment of wages was not peculiar to the Elizabethan system. It lasted very much
longer, down to our own times in fact. In 1588 the seamen of the fleet were kept without their
pay for several months. In the great majority of cases, and most likely in all, the number
of these months was less than six. Even within the nineteenth century men-of-war's men had
to wait for their pay for years. Commander C. N. Robinson, in his 'British Fleet,'[79] a book
that ought to be in every Englishman's library, remarks: 'All through the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries it was the rule not to pay anybody until the end of the commission, and to a certain
degree the practice obtained until some fifty years ago.' As to the nineteenth century, Lord
Dundonald, speaking in Parliament, may be quoted. He said that of the ships on the East Indies
station, the Centurion's men had been unpaid for eleven years; the Rattlesnake's for fourteen;
the Fox's for fifteen. The Elizabethan practice compared with this will look almost precipitate
instead of dilatory. To draw again on my personal experience, I may say that I have been kept
without pay for a longer time than most of the people in Lord Howard's fleet, as, for the first
two years that I was at sea, young officers were paid only once in six months; and then never
in cash, but always in bills. The reader may be left to imagine what happened when a naval
cadet tried to get a bill for some £7 or £8 cashed at a small Spanish-American port.

[Footnote 79: London, 1894.]

A great deal has been made of the strict audit of the accounts of Howard's fleet. Until a very
recent period, well within the last reign, no commanding officer, on a ship being paid off,
could receive the residue of his pay, or get any half-pay at all, until his 'accounts had been
passed.'[80] The same rule applied to officers in charge of money or stores. It has been made
a further charge against Elizabeth that her officers had to meet certain expenditure out of
their own pockets. That certainly is not a peculiarity of the sixteenth-century navy. Till
less than fifty years ago the captain of a British man-of-war had to provide one of the three
chronometers used in the navigation of his ship. Even later than that the articles necessary
for cleaning the ship and everything required for decorating her were paid for by the officers,
almost invariably by the first lieutenant, or second in command. There must be many officers
still serving who have spent sums, considerable in the aggregate, of their own money on public
objects. Though pressure in this respect has been much relieved of late, there are doubtless
many who do so still. It is, in fact, a traditional practice in the British Navy and is not
in the least distinctly Elizabethan.

[Footnote 80: This happened to me in 1904.]

Some acquaintance with present conditions and accurate knowledge of the naval methods prevailing
in the great Queen's reign--a knowledge which the publication of the original documents puts
within the reach of anyone who really cares to know the truth--will convince the candid inquirer
that Elizabeth's administration of the navy compares favourably with that of any of her successors;
and that, for it, she deserves the admiration and unalloyed gratitude of the nation.

NELSON: THE CENTENARY OF TRAFALGAR

[The following article was read as an address, in compliance with the request of its Council,
at the annual meeting of the Navy Records Society in July 1905. It was, and indeed is still,
my opinion, as stated to the meeting in some prefatory remarks, that the address would have
come better from a professed historian, several members of the Society being well known as
entitled to that designation. The Council, however, considered that, as Nelson's tactical principles
and achievements should be dealt with, it would be better for the address to be delivered by
a naval officer--one, moreover, who had personal experience of the manoeuvres of fleets under
sail. Space would not suffice for treating of Nelson's merits as a strategist, though they
are as great as those which he possessed as a tactician.]

Centenary commemorations are common enough; but the commemoration of Nelson has a characteristic
which distinguishes it from most, if not from all, others. In these days we forget soon. What
place is still kept in our memories by even the most illustrious of those who have but recently
left us? It is not only that we do not remember their wishes and injunctions; their existence
has almost faded from our recollection. It is not difficult to persuade people to commemorate
a departed worthy; but in most cases industry has to take the place of enthusiasm, and moribund
or extinct remembrances have to be galvanised by assiduity into a semblance of life. In the
case of Nelson the conditions are very different. He may have been misunderstood; even by his
professional descendants his acts and doctrines may have been misinterpreted; but he has never
been forgotten.

The time has now come when we can specially do honour to Nelson's memory without wounding the
feelings of other nations. There is no need to exult over or even to expatiate on the defeats
of others. In recalling the past it is more dignified as regards ourselves, and more considerate
of the honour of our great admiral, to think of the valour and self-devotion rather than the
misfortunes of those against whom he fought. We can do full justice to Nelson's memory without
reopening old wounds.

The first thing to be noted concerning him is that he is the only man who has ever lived who
by universal consent is without a peer. This is said in full view of the new constellation
rising above the Eastern horizon; for that constellation, brilliant as it is, has not yet reached
the meridian. In every walk of life, except that which Nelson chose as his own, you will find
several competitors for the first place, each one of whom will have many supporters. Alexander
of Macedon, Hannibal, Cæsar, Marlborough, Frederick the Great, and Napoleon have been severally
put forward for the palm of generalship. To those who would acclaim Richelieu as the first
of statesmen, others would oppose Chatham, or William Pitt, or Cavour, or Bismarck, or Marquis
Ito. Who was the first of sculptors? who the first of painters? who the first of poets? In
every case there is a great difference of opinion. Ask, however, who was the first of admirals,
and the unanimous reply will still be--'Nelson,' tried as he was by many years of high command
in war. It is not only amongst his fellow-countrymen that his preeminence is acknowledged.
Foreigners admit it as readily as we proclaim it ourselves.

We may consider what it was that gave Nelson this unique position among men. The early conditions
of his naval career were certainly not favourable to him. It is true that he was promoted when
young; but so were many other officers. Nelson was made a commander only a few months after
the outbreak of war between Great Britain and France, and was made a post-captain within a
few days of the declaration of war by Spain. An officer holding a rank qualifying him for command
at the outset of a great war might well have looked forward confidently to exceptional opportunities
of distinguishing himself. Even in our own days, when some trifling campaign is about to be
carried on, the officers who are employed where they can take no part in it vehemently lament
their ill-fortune. How much more disheartening must it have been to be excluded from active
participation in a great and long-continued conflict! This was Nelson's case. As far as his
hopes of gaining distinction were concerned, fate seemed to persecute him pertinaciously. He
was a captain of more than four years' seniority when the treaty of Versailles put an end to
the war of American Independence. Yet, with the exception of the brief Nicaragua expedition--which
by the side of the important occurrences of grand naval campaigns must have seemed insignificant--his
services during all those years of hostilities were uneventful, and even humdrum. He seemed
to miss every important operation; and when the war ended--we may almost say--he had never
seen a ship fire a broadside in anger.

There then came what promised to be, and in fact turned out to be, a long period of peace.
With no distinguished war service to point to, and with the prospect before him of only uneventful
employment, or no employment afloat at all, Nelson might well have been disheartened to the
verge of despondency. That he was not disheartened, but, instead thereof, made a name for himself
in such unfavourable circumstances, must be accepted as one of the most convincing proofs of
his rare force of character. To have attracted the notice, and to have secured the confidence,
of so great a sea-officer as Lord Hood constituted a distinction which could have been won
only by merit so considerable that it could not long remain unrecognised. The war of American
Independence had still seven months to run when Lord Hood pointed to Nelson as an officer to
be consulted on 'questions relative to naval tactics,' Professor Laughton tells us that at
that time Nelson had never served with a fleet. Lord Hood was one of the last men in the world
to go out of his way to pay to a youthful subordinate an empty compliment, and we may confidently
base our estimate of an officer's merits on Lord Hood's belief in them.

He, no doubt, gave a Wide signification to the term 'tactics,' and used it as embracing all
that is included in the phrase 'conduct of war.' He must have found out, from conversations
with, and from the remarks of, the young captain, whom he treated as intimately as if he was
his son, that the latter was already, what he continued to be till the end, viz. a student
of naval warfare. This point deserves particular attention. The officers of the navy of the
present day, period of peace though it be, can imitate Nelson at least in this. He had to wait
a long time before he could translate into brilliant action the result of his tactical studies.
His recent biographers, Captain Mahan and Professor Laughton, feel constrained to tell us over
and over again that Nelson's predominant characteristic was not mere 'headlong valour and instinct
for fighting'; that he was not the man 'to run needless and useless risks' in battle. There
is something very remarkable in the way in which Mr. Gutteridge's volume[82] not only confirms
Captain Mahan's refutation of the aspersions on Nelson's honour and humanity, but also establishes
Professor Laughton's conclusions, reached many years ago, that it was the orders given to him,
and not his amour, which detained him at Naples at a well-known epoch. The last volume issued
by the Society, that of Mr. Julian Corbett,[83] is, I venture to affirm, the most useful to
naval officers that has yet appeared among the Society's publications. It will provide them
with an admirable historical introduction to the study of tactics, and greatly help them in
ascertaining the importance of Nelson's achievements as a tactician. For my own part, I may
say with gratitude that but for Mr. Corbett's valuable work I could not have completed this
appreciation.

[Footnote 82: NelsonandtheNeapolitanJacobins.]

[Footnote 83: FightingInstructions, 1530-1816.]

The most renowned of Nelson's achievements was that performed in his final battle and victory.
Strange as it may seem, that celebrated performance has been the subject of much controversy,
and, brilliant as it was, the tactics adopted in it have been freely, and indeed unfavourably,
criticised. There is still much difference of opinion as to the preliminary movements, and
as to the exact method by which Nelson's attack was made. It has been often asserted that the
method really followed was not that which Nelson had expressly declared his intention of adopting.
The question raised concerning this is a difficult one, and, until the appearance of Mr. Julian
Corbett's recent work and the interesting volume on Trafalgar lately published by Mr. H. Newbolt,
had not been fully discussed. The late Vice-Admiral P. H. Colomb contributed to the UnitedServiceMagazine
of September 1899 a very striking article on the subject of Nelson's tactics in his last battle,
and those who propose to study the case should certainly peruse what he wrote.

The criticism of Nelson's procedure at Trafalgar in its strongest form may be summarised as
follows. It is affirmed that he drew up and communicated to the officers under his orders a
certain plan of attack; that just before the battle he changed his plan without warning; that
he hurried on his attack unnecessarily; that he exposed his fleet to excessive peril; and,
because of all this, that the British loss was much heavier and much less evenly distributed
among the ships of the fleet than it need have been. The most formidable arraignment of the
mode of Nelson's last attack is, undoubtedly, to be found in the paper published by Sir Charles
Ekins in his book on 'Naval Battles,' and vouched for by him as the work of an eye-witness--almost
certainly, as Mr. Julian Corbett holds, an officer on board the Conqueror in the battle. It
is a remarkable document. Being critical rather than instructive, it is not to be classed with
the essay of Clerk of Eldin; but it is one of the most important contributions to the investigation
of tactical questions ever published in the English tongue. On it are based nearly, or quite,
all the unfavourable views expressed concerning the British tactics at Trafalgar. As it contains
a respectfully stated, but still sharp, criticism of Nelson's action, it will not be thought
presumptuous if we criticise it in its turn.

Notwithstanding the fact that the author of the paper actually took part in the battle, and
that he was gifted with no mean tactical insight, it is permissible to say that his remarks
have an academic tinge. In fact, they are very much of the kind that a clever professor of
tactics, who had not felt the responsibilities inseparable from the command of a fleet, would
put before a class of students. Between a professor of tactics, however clever, and a commanding
genius like Nelson the difference is great indeed. The writer of the paper in question perhaps
expressed the more general opinion of his day. He has certainly suggested opinions to later
generations of naval officers. The captains who shared in Nelson's last great victory did not
agree among themselves as to the mode in which the attack was introduced. It was believed by
some of them, and, thanks largely to the Conqueror officer's paper, it is generally believed
now, that, whereas Nelson had announced his intention of advancing to the attack in lines-abreast
or lines-of-bearing, he really did so in lines-ahead. Following up the path of investigation
to which, in his article above mentioned, Admiral Colomb had already pointed, we can, I think,
arrive only at the conclusion that the announced intention was adhered to.

Before the reasons for this conclusion are given it will be convenient to deal with the suggestions,
or allegations, that Nelson exposed his fleet at Trafalgar to unduly heavy loss, putting it
in the power of the enemy--to use the words of the Conqueror's officer--to 'have annihilated
the ships one after another in detail'; and that 'the brunt of the action would have been more
equally felt' had a different mode of advance from that actually chosen been adopted. Now,
Trafalgar was a battle in which an inferior fleet of twenty-six ships gained a victory over
a superior fleet of thirty-three. The victory was so decisive that more than half of the enemy's
capital ships were captured or destroyed on the spot, and the remainder were so battered that
some fell an easy prey to the victor's side soon after the battle, the rest having limped painfully
to the shelter of a fortified port near at hand. To gain such a victory over a superior force
of seamen justly celebrated for their spirit and gallantry, very hard fighting was necessary.
The only actions of the Napoleonic period that can be compared with it are those of Camperdown,
the Nile, and Copenhagen. The proportionate loss at Trafalgar was the least in all the four
battles.[84] The allegation that, had Nelson followed a different method at Trafalgar, the
'brunt of the action would have been more equally felt' can be disposed of easily. In nearly
all sea-fights, whether Nelsonic in character or not, half of the loss of the victors has fallen
on considerably less than half the fleet. That this has been the rule, whatever tactical method
may have been adopted, will appear from the following statement. In Rodney's victory (12th
April 1782) half the loss fell upon nine ships out of thirty-six, or one-fourth; at 'The First
of June' it fell upon five ships out of twenty-five, or one-fifth; at St. Vincent it fell upon
three ships out of fifteen, also one-fifth; at Trafalgar half the loss fell on five ships out
of twenty-seven, or very little less than an exact fifth. It has, therefore, been conclusively
shown that, faulty or not faulty, long-announced or hastily adopted, the plan on which the
battle of Trafalgar was fought did not occasion excessive loss to the victors or confine the
loss, such as it was, to an unduly small portion of their fleet. As bearing on this question
of the relative severity of the British loss at Trafalgar, it may be remarked that in that
battle there were several British ships which had been in other great sea-fights. Their losses
in these latter were in nearly every case heavier than their Trafalgar losses.[85] Authoritative
and undisputed figures show how baseless are the suggestions that Nelson's tactical procedure
at Trafalgar caused his fleet to suffer needlessly heavy loss.

[In only one case was the Trafalgar total loss greater than the total loss of the same ship
in an earlier fight; and in this case (the Defiance) the number of killed at Trafalgar was
only about two-thirds of the number killed in the other action.]

It is now necessary to investigate the statement that Nelson, hastily and without warning,
changed his plan for fighting the battle. This investigation is much more difficult than that
into the losses of the British fleet, because, whilst the latter can be settled by arithmetic,
the former must proceed largely upon conjecture. How desirable it is to make the investigation
of the statement mentioned will be manifest when we reflect on the curious fact that the very
completeness of Nelson's success at Trafalgar checked, or, indeed, virtually destroyed, the
study of tactics in the British Navy for more than three-quarters of a century. His action
was so misunderstood, or, at any rate, so variously represented, that it generally passed for
gospel in our service that Nelson's method consisted merely in rushing at his enemy as soon
as he saw him. Against this conception his biographers, one after another, have protested in vain.

At the outset of this investigation it will be well to call to mind two or three things, simple
enough, but not always remembered. One of these is that advancing to the attack and the attack
itself are not the same operations. Another is, that, in the order of sailing in two or more
columns, if the ships were 'by the wind' or close-hauled--the column-leaders were not abeam
of each other, but bore from one another in the direction of the wind. Also, it may be mentioned
that by simple alterations of course a line-abreast may be converted into a line-of-bearing
and a line-of-bearing into a line-ahead, and that the reverse can be effected by the same operation.
Again, adherence to a plan which presupposes the enemy's fleet to be in a particular formation
after he is found to be in another is not to be expected of a consummate tactician. This remark
is introduced here with full knowledge of the probability that it will be quoted as an admission
that Nelson did change his plan without warning. No admission of the kind is intended. The
'advance squadron,' it should be noted, was not to be ahead of the two main divisions, but
in such a position that it could be moved to strengthen either. The name seems to have been
due to the mode in which the ships composing the squadron were employed in, so to speak, 'feeling
for' the enemy. On 19th October six ships were ordered 'to go ahead during the night'; and,
besides the frigates, two more ships were so stationed as to keep up the communication between
the six and the commander-in-chief's flag-ship. Thus eight ships in effect composed an 'advance
squadron,' and did not join either of the main divisions at first.

When it was expected that the British fleet would comprise forty sail-of-the-line and the enemy's
fleet forty-six, each British main division was to be made up of sixteen ships; and eight two-deckers
added to either division would increase the strength of the latter to twenty-four ships. It
is interesting to note that, omitting the Africa, which ship came up late, each British main
division on the morning of 21st October 1805 had nine ships--a number which, by the addition
of the eight already mentioned as distinct from the divisions, could have been increased to
seventeen, thus, except for a fraction, exactly maintaining the original proportion as regards
the hostile fleet, which was now found to be composed of thirty-three ships.

During the night of 20th-21st October the Franco-Spanish fleet, which had been sailing in three
divisions and a 'squadron of observation,' formed line and stood to the southward, heading
a little to the eastward of south. The 'squadron of observation' was parallel to the main body
and to windward (in this case to the westward) of it, with the leading ships rather more advanced.

The British main divisions steered WSW. till 1 A.M. After that they steered SW. till 4 A.M.
There are great difficulties about the time, as the notation of it[86] differed considerably
in different ships; but the above hours are taken from the Victory's log. At 4 A.M. the British
fleet, or rather its main divisions, wore and stood N. by E. As the wind was about NW. by W.,
the ships were close-hauled, and the leader of the 'lee-line,' i.e. Collingwood's flag-ship,
was when in station two points abaft the Victory's beam as soon as the 'order of sailing' in
two columns--which was to be the order of battle--had been formed.

[Footnote 86: Except the chronometers, which were instruments of navigation so precious as
always to be kept under lock and key, there were no clocks in the navy till some years after
I joined it. Time on board ship was kept by half-hour sand-glasses.]

About 6 A.M. the enemy's fleet was sighted from the Victory, and observed to bear from her
E. by S. and be distant from her ten or twelve miles. The distance is corroborated by observed
bearings from Collingwood's flag-ship.[87] Viewed from the British ships, placed as they were
relatively to it, the enemy's fleet must have appeared as a long single line-ahead, perhaps
not very exactly formed. As soon as the hostile force was clearly made out, the British divisions
bore up and stood to the eastward, steering by the Victory's compass ENE. The position and
formation of the British main divisions were by this made exactly those in which they are shown
in the diagram usually attached to the celebrated memorandum of 9th October 1805. The enemy
must have appeared to the British, who were ten or twelve miles to windward of him, and on
his beam, as if he were formed in line-ahead. He therefore was also in the position and formation
assigned to him in that diagram.

[Footnote 87: It would necessitate the use of some technicalities to explain it fully; but
it may be said that the bearings of the extremes of the enemy's line observed from his flag-ship
prove that Collingwood was in the station that he ought to have occupied when the British fleet
was in the Order of Sailing and close to the wind.]

At a time which, because of the variety in the notations of it, it is difficult to fix exactly,
but somewhere between 7 and 8 A.M., the enemy's ships wore together and endeavoured to form
a line to the northward, which, owing to the direction of the wind, must have been about N.
by E. and S. by W., or NNE. and SSW. The operation--not merely of wearing, but of both wearing
and reforming the line, such as it was--took more than an hour to complete. The wind was light;
there was a westerly swell; the ships were under easy sail; consequently there must have been
a good deal of leeway, and the hostile or 'combined' fleet headed in the direction of Cadiz,
towards which, we are expressly told by a high French authority--Chevalier--it advanced.

Nelson had to direct the course of his fleet so that its divisions, when about to make the
actual attack, would be just opposite the points to which the respective hostile ships had
advanced in the meantime. In a light wind varying in force a direct course to those points
could not be settled once for all; but that first chosen was very nearly right, and an alteration
of a point, viz. to E. by N., was for a considerable time all that was necessary. Collingwood
later made a signal to his division to alter course one point to port, which brought them back
to the earlier course, which by the Victory's compass had been ENE. The eight ships of what
has been referred to as the 'advance squadron' were distributed between the two main British
divisions, six being assigned to Collingwood's and two to Nelson's. They did not all join their
divisions at the same time, some--probably owing to the distance at which they had been employed
from the rest of the fleet and the feebleness of the breeze--not till several hours after the
combined fleet had been sighted.

Collingwood preserved in his division a line-of-bearing apparently until the very moment when
the individual ships pushed on to make the actual attack. The enemy's fleet is usually represented
as forming a curve. It would probably be more correct to call it a very obtuse re-entering
angle. This must have been largely due to Gravina's 'squadron of observation' keeping away
in succession, to get into the wake of the rest of the line, which was forming towards the
north. About the centre of the combined fleet there was a gap of a mile. Ahead and astern of
this the ships were not all in each other's wake. Many were to leeward of their stations, thus
giving the enemy's formation the appearance of a double line, or rather of a string of groups
of ships. It is important to remember this, because no possible mode of attack--the enemy's
fleet being formed as it was--could have prevented some British ships from being 'doubled on'
when they cut into the enemy's force. On 'The First of June,' notwithstanding that the advance
to the attack was intended to be in line-abreast, several British ships were 'doubled on,'
and even 'trebled on,' as will be seen in the experiences on that day of the Brunswick, Marlborough,
RoyalSovereign, and QueenCharlotte herself.

Owing to the shape of the hostile 'line' at Trafalgar and the formation in which he kept his
division, Collingwood brought his ships, up till the very moment when each proceeded to deliver
her attack, in the formation laid down in the oft-quoted memorandum. By the terms of that document
Nelson had specifically assigned to his own division the work of seeing that the movements
of Collingwood's division should be interrupted as little as possible. It would, of course,
have been beyond his power to do this if the position of his own division in the echelon formation
prescribed in the memorandum had been rigorously adhered to after Collingwood was getting near
his objective point. In execution, therefore, of the service allotted to his division, Nelson
made a feint at the enemy's van. This necessitated an alteration of course to port, so that
his ships came into a 'line-of-bearing' so very oblique that it may well have been loosely
called a 'line-ahead.' Sir Charles Ekins says that the two British lines 'afterwards fell into
line-ahead, the ships in the wake of each other,' and that this was in obedience to signal.
Collingwood's line certainly did not fall into line-ahead. At the most it was a rather oblique
line-of-bearing almost parallel to that part of the enemy's fleet which he was about to attack.
In Nelson's line there was more than one alteration of course, as the Victory's log expressly
states that she kept standing for the enemy's van, which we learn from the French accounts
was moving about N. by E. or NNE. In the light wind prevailing the alterations of course must
have rendered it, towards the end of the forenoon, impossible to keep exact station, even if
the Victory were to shorten sail, which we know she did not. As Admiral Colomb pointed out,
'Several later signals are recorded which were proper to make in lines-of-bearing, but not
in lines-ahead.' It is difficult to import into this fact any other meaning but that of intention
to preserve, however obliquely, the line-of-bearing which undoubtedly had been formed by the
act of bearing-up as soon as the enemy's fleet had been distinguished.

When Collingwood had moved near enough to the enemy to let his ships deliver their attacks,
it became unnecessary for Nelson's division to provide against the other's being interrupted.
Accordingly, he headed for the point at which he meant to cut into the enemy's fleet. Now came
the moment, as regards his division, for doing what Collingwood's had already begun to do,
viz. engage in a 'pell-mell battle,'[88] which surely may be interpreted as meaning a battle
in which rigorous station-keeping was no longer expected, and in which 'no captain could do
very wrong if he placed his ship alongside that of the enemy.'

[Footnote 88: Nelson's own expression.]

In several diagrams of the battle as supposed to have been fought the two British divisions
just before the moment of impact are represented as converging towards each other. The Spanish
diagram, lately reproduced by Mr. Newbolt, shows this, as well as the English diagrams. We
may take it, therefore, that there was towards the end of the forenoon a convergence of the
two columns, and that this was due to Nelson's return from his feint at the hostile van to
the line from which he intended to let go his ships to deliver the actual attack. Collingwood's
small alteration of course of one point to port slightly, but only slightly, accentuated this
convergence.

Enough has been said here of Nelson's tactics at Trafalgar. To discuss them fully would lead
me too far for this occasion.

I can only express the hope that in the navy the subject will receive fuller consideration
hereafter. Nelson's last victory was gained, be it remembered, in one afternoon, over a fleet
more than 20 per cent. his superior in numbers, and was so decisive that more than half of
the hostile ships were taken. This was the crowning effort of seven years spent in virtually
independent command in time of war--seven years, too, illustrated by more than one great victory.

The more closely we look into Nelson's tactical achievements, the more effective and brilliant
do they appear. It is the same with his character and disposition. The more exact researches
and investigations of recent times have removed from his name the obloquy which it pleased
some to cast upon it. We can see now that his 'childlike, delighted vanity'--to use the phrase
of his greatest biographer--was but a thin incrustation on noble qualities. As in the material
world valueless earthy substances surround a vein of precious metal, so through Nelson's moral
nature there ran an opulent lode of character, unimpaired in its priceless worth by adjacent
frailties which, in the majority of mankind, are present without any precious stuff beneath
them. It is with minds prepared to see this that we should commemorate our great admiral.

Veneration of Nelson's memory cannot be confined to particular objects or be limited by locality.
His tomb is wider than the space covered by dome or column, and his real monument is more durable
than any material construction. It is the unwritten and spiritual memorial of him, firmly fixed
in the hearts of his fellow-countrymen.

X

THE SHARE OF THE FLEET IN THE DEFENCE OF THE EMPIRE[89]

[Footnote 89: Written in 1907. (NavalAnnual, 1908.)]

At the close of the Great War, which ended in the downfall of Napoleon, the maritime position
of the British Empire was not only predominant--it also was, and long remained, beyond the
reach of challenge. After the stupendous events of the great contest such successes as those
at Algiers where we were helped by the Dutch, at Navarino where we had two allies, and at Acre
were regarded as matters of course, and no very grave issue hung upon any one of them. For
more than half a century after Nelson's death all the most brilliant achievements of British
arms were performed on shore, in India or in the Crimea. There were also many small wars on
land, and it may well have seemed to contemporaries that the days of great naval contests were
over and that force of circumstances was converting us into a military from a naval nation.
The belief in the efficacy of naval defence was not extinct, but it had ceased to operate actively.
Even whilst the necessity of that form of defence was far more urgent, inattention to or ignorance
of its true principles had occasionally allowed it to grow weak, but the possibility of substituting
something else for it had not been pressed or even suggested. To this, however, we had now
come; and it was largely a consequence of the Crimean war. In that war the British Army had
nobly sustained its reputation as a fighting machine. For the first time after a long interval
it had met in battle European troops, and had come out of the conflict more renowned for bravery
than ever. Nothing seemed able to damp its heroism--not scantiness of food, not lack of clothing
amidst bitter cold, not miserable quarters, not superior forces of a valiant enemy. It clung
to its squalid abodes in the positions which it was ordered to hold with a tenacious fortitude
that had never been surpassed in its glorious history, and that defied all assaults. In combination
with its brave allies it brought to a triumphant conclusion a war of an altogether peculiar
character.

The campaign in the Crimea was in reality the siege of a single fortress. All the movements
of the Western invaders were undertaken to bring them within striking distance of the place,
to keep them within reach of it, or to capture it. Every battle that occurred was fought with
one of those objects. When the place fell the war ended. The one general who, in the opinion
of all concerned, gained high distinction in the war was the general who had prolonged the
defence of Sebastopol by the skilful use of earthworks. It was no wonder that the attack and
defence of fortified places assumed large importance in the eyes of the British people. The
command of the sea held by the allied powers was so complete and all-pervading that no one
stopped to think what the course of hostilities would have been without it, any more than men
stop to think what the course of any particular business would be if there were no atmosphere
to breathe in. Not a single allied soldier had been delayed on passage by the hostile fleet;
not a single merchant vessel belonging to the allies had been captured by a hostile cruiser.
Supplies and reinforcements for the besieging armies were transported to them without escort
and with as little risk of interruption as if the operations had been those of profound peace.

No sooner was the Crimean war over than another struggle took place, viz. the war of the Indian
Mutiny, and that also was waged entirely on land. Here again the command of the sea was so
complete that no interruption of it, even temporary, called attention to its existence. Troops
and supplies were sent to India from the United Kingdom and from Hong-Kong; horses for military
purposes from Australia and South Africa; and in every case without a thought of naval escort.
The experience of hostilities in India seemed to confirm the experience of the Crimea. What
we had just done to a great European nation was assumed to be what unfriendly European nations
would wish to do and would be able to do to us. It was also assumed that the only way of frustrating
their designs would be to do what had recently been done in the hope of frustrating ours, but
to do it better. We must--it was said--depend on fortifications, but more perfect than those
which had failed to save Sebastopol.

The protection to be afforded by our fleet was deliberately declared to be insufficient. It
might, so it was held, be absent altogether, and then there would be nothing but fortifications
to stand between us and the progress of an active enemy. In the result the policy of constructing
imposing passive defence-works on our coast was adopted. The fortifications had to be multiplied.
Dependence on that class of defence inevitably leads to discovery after discovery that some
spot open to the kind of attack feared has not been made secure. We began by fortifying the
great dockyard ports--on the sea side against a hostile fleet, on the land side against hostile
troops. Then it was perceived that to fortify the dockyard ports in the mother country afforded
very little protection to the outlying portions of the empire. So their principal ports also
were given defence-works--sometimes of an elaborate character. Again, it was found that commercial
ports had been left out and that they too must be fortified. When this was done spots were
observed at which an enemy might effect a landing in force, to prevent which further forts
or batteries must be erected. The most striking thing in all this is the complete omission
to take note of the conditions involved in the command of the sea.

Evidently it had not been understood that it was that very command which alone had enabled
the armies of western Europe to proceed, not only without serious interruption, but also without
encountering an attempt at obstruction, to the field in the Crimea on which their victories
had been won, and that the same command would be necessary before any hostile expedition, large
enough to justify the construction of the fortifications specially intended to repel it, could
cross the sea and get within striking distance of our shores. It should be deeply interesting
to the people of those parts of the British Empire which lie beyond sea to note that the defensive
system comprised in the fortification of the coast of the United Kingdom promised no security
to them in the event of war. Making all proper allowance for the superior urgency of defending
the heart of the empire, we must still admit that no system of defence is adequate which does
not provide for the defence of other valuable parts of the great body politic as well.

Again, the system of defence proved to be imperfect. Every part of the empire depended for
prosperity--some parts depended for existence--on practically unrestricted traffic on the ocean.
This, which might be assailed at many points and on lines often thousands of miles in length,
could find little or no defence in immovable fortifications. It could not be held that the
existence of these released the fleet from all duty but that of protecting our ocean commerce,
because, if any enemy's navy was able to carry out an operation of such magnitude and difficulty
as a serious attack on our home territory, it would assuredly be able to carry out the work
of damaging our maritime trade. Power to do the latter has always belonged to the navy which
was in a position to extend its activity persistently to the immediate neighbourhood of its
opponent's coast-line.

It is not to be supposed that there was no one to point this out. Several persons did so, but
being mostly sailors they were not listened to. In actual practice the whole domain of imperial
strategy was withdrawn from the intervention of the naval officer, as though it were something
with which he could not have anything to do. Several great wars had been waged in Europe in
the meantime, and all of them were land wars. Naval forces, if employed at all, were employed
only just enough to bring out how insignificant their participation in them was. As was to
have been expected, the habit of attaching importance to the naval element of imperial defence
declined. The empire, nevertheless, continued to grow. Its territory was extended; its population,
notably its population of European stock, increased, and its wealth and the subsequent operations
of exchanging its productions for those of other countries were enormously expanded. At the
same time the navy, to the strength and efficiency of which it had to look for security, declined
absolutely, and still more relatively. Other navies were advancing: some had, as it were, come
into existence. At last the true conditions were discerned, and the nation, almost with one
voice, demanded that the naval defences of the empire should be put upon a proper footing.

Let no one dismiss the foregoing retrospect as merely ancient history. On the contrary, let
all those who desire to see the British Empire follow the path of its natural development in
tranquillity study the recent past. By doing this we shall be able to estimate aright the position
of the fleet in the defence of the empire. We must examine the circumstances in which we are
placed. For five-and-thirty years the nations of the world have practically lived under the
rule of force. The incessant object of every great state has been to increase the strength
of its armed forces up to the point at which the cost becomes intolerable. Countries separated
from one another only by arbitrary geographical lines add regiment to regiment and gun to gun,
and also devise continually fresh expedients for accelerating the work of preparing their armies
to take the field. The most pacifically inclined nation must do in this respect as its neighbours
do, on pain of losing its independence and being mutilated in its territory if it does not.
This rivalry has spread to the sea, and fleets are increased at a rate and at a cost in money
unknown to former times, even to those of war. The possession of a powerful navy by some state
which has no reason to apprehend over-sea invasion and which has no maritime interests, however
intrinsically important they may be, commensurate with the strength of its fleets, may not
indicate a spirit of aggression; but it at least indicates ability to become an aggressor.
Consequently, for the British fleet to fill its proper position in the defence of the empire
it must be strong. To be strong more than large numbers will be required. It must have the
right, that is the best, material, the best organisation, the best discipline, the best training,
the best distribution. We shall ascertain the position that it should hold, if we examine what
it would have to do when called upon for work more active than that of peace time. With the
exception of India and Canada no part of the empire is liable to serious attack that does not
come over-sea. Any support that can be given to India or Canada by other parts of the empire
must be conveyed across the sea also. This at once indicates the importance of ocean lines
of communication.

War is the method adopted, when less violent means of persuasion have failed, to force your
enemy to comply with your demands. There are three principal ways of effecting this--invasion
of his country, raids on his territory, destruction or serious damage of his sea-borne commerce.
Successful invasion must compel the invaded to come to terms, or his national existence will
be lost. Raids upon his territory may possibly so distress him that he would rather concede
your terms than continue the struggle.[90] Damage to his sea-borne commerce may be carried
so far that he will be ruined if he does not give in. So much for one side of the account;
we have to examine the other. Against invasion, raids, or attempts at commerce-destruction
there must be some form of defence, and, as a matter of historical fact, defence against each
has been repeatedly successful. If we need instances we have only to peruse the history of
the British Empire.

[Footnote 90: Though raids rarely, if ever, decide a war, they may cause inconvenience or local
distress, and an enemy desiring to make them should be obstructed as much as possible.]

How was it that--whilst we landed invading armies in many hostile countries, seized many portions
of hostile territory, and drove more than one enemy's commerce from the sea--our own country
has been free from successful invasion for more than eight centuries, few portions of our territory
have been taken from us even temporarily, and our commerce has increased throughout protracted
maritime wars? To this there can only be one answer, viz. that the arrangements for defence
were effectual. What, then, were these arrangements? They were comprised in the provision of
a powerful, well-distributed, well-handled navy, and of a mobile army of suitable strength.
It is to be observed that each element possessed the characteristic of mobility. We have to
deal here more especially with the naval element, and we must study the manner in which it
operates.

Naval war is sea-power in action; and sea-power, taken in the narrow sense, has limitations.
It may not, even when so taken, cease to act at the enemy's coast-line, but its direct influence
extends only to the inner side of a narrow zone conforming to that line. In a maritime contest
each side tries to control the ocean communications and to prevent the other from controlling
them. If either gains the control, something in addition to sea-power strictly defined may
begin to operate: the other side's territory may be invaded or harassed by considerable raids,
and its commerce may be driven from the sea. It will be noticed that control of ocean communications
is the needful preliminary to these. It is merely a variant of the often employed expression
of the necessity, in war, of obtaining command of the sea. In the case of the most important
portion of the British Empire, viz. the United Kingdom, our loss of control of the ocean communications
would have a result which scarcely any foreign country would experience. Other countries are
dependent on importations for some part of the food of their population and of the raw material
of their industry; but much of the importation is, and perhaps all of it may be, effected by
land. Here, we depend upon imports from abroad for a very large part of the food of our people,
and of the raw material essential to the manufacture of the commodities by the exchange of
which we obtain necessary supplies; and the whole of these imports come, and must come to us,
by sea. Also, if we had not freedom of exportation, our wealth and the means of supporting
a war would disappear. Probably all the greater colonies and India could feed their inhabitants
for a moderately long time without sea-borne imports, but unless the sea were open to them
their prosperity would decline.

This teaches us the necessity to the British Empire of controlling our maritime communications,
and equally teaches those who may one day be our enemies the advisability of preventing us
from doing so. The lesson in either case is driven farther home by other considerations connected
with communications. In war a belligerent has two tasks before him. He has to defend himself
and hurt his enemy. The more he hurts his enemy, the less is he likely to be hurt himself.
This defines the great principle of offensive defence. To act in accordance with this principle,
a belligerent should try, as the saying goes, to carry the war into the enemy's country. He
should try to make his opponents fight where he wants them to fight, which will probably be
as far as possible from his own territory and as near as possible to theirs. Unless he can
do this, invasion and even serious raids by him will be out of the question. More than that,
his inability to do it will virtually indicate that on its part the other side can fix the
scene of active hostilities unpleasantly close to the points from which he desires to keep
its forces away.

A line of ocean communications may be vulnerable throughout its length; but it does not follow
that an assailant can operate against it with equal facility at every point, nor does it follow
that it is at every point equally worth assailing. Lines running past hostile naval ports are
especially open to assault in the part near the ports; and lines formed by the confluence of
two or more other lines--like, for example, those which enter the English Channel--will generally
include a greater abundance of valuable traffic than others. Consequently there are some parts
at which an enemy may be expected to be more active than elsewhere, and it is from those very
parts that it is most desirable to exclude him. They are, as a rule, relatively near to the
territory of the state whose navy has to keep the lines open, that is to say, prevent their
being persistently beset by an enemy. The necessary convergence of lines towards that state's
ports shows that some portion of them would have to be traversed, or their traversing be attempted,
by expeditions meant to carry out either invasion or raids. If, therefore, the enemy can be
excluded as above mentioned, invasions, raids, and the more serious molestation of sea-borne
commerce by him will be prevented.

If we consider particular cases we shall find proof upon proof of the validity of the rule.
Three great lines--one from the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope, one from the Red Sea,
and a third from India and Ceylon--converge near the south-western part of Australia and run
as one line towards the territory of the important states farther east. If an assailant can
be excluded from the latter or combined line he must either divide his force or operate on
only one of the confluents, leaving the rest free. The farther he can be pushed back from the
point of confluence the more effectually will he be limited to a single line, because the combining
lines, traced backwards, trend more and more apart, and it is, therefore, more and more difficult
for him to keep detachments of his force within supporting distance of each other if they continue
to act against two or more lines. The particular case of the approaches to the territory of
the United Kingdom has the same features, and proves the rule with equal clearness. This latter
case is so often adduced without mention of others, that there is some risk of its being believed
to be a solitary one. It stands, however, exactly on all fours with all the rest as regards
the principle of the rule.

A necessary consequence of an enemy's exclusion from the combined line as it approaches the
territory to be defended is--as already suggested--that invasion of that territory and serious
raids upon it will be rendered impracticable. Indeed, if the exclusion be absolutely complete
and permanent, raids of every kind and depredations on commerce in the neighbourhood will be
prevented altogether. It should be explained that though lines and communications are spoken
of, it is the area crossed by them which is strategically important. A naval force, either
guarding or intending to assail a line, does not necessarily station itself permanently upon
it. All that it has to do is to remain, for the proper length of time, within the strategic
area across which the defended or threatened line runs. The strategic area will be of varying
extent, its boundaries being determined by circumstances. The object of the defence will be
to make the area from which the enemy's ships are excluded as extensive as possible. When the
enemy has been pushed back into his own waters and into his own ports the exclusion is strategically
complete. The sea is denied to his invading and important raiding expeditions, and indeed to
most of his individual cruisers. At the same time it is free to the other belligerent. To effect
this a vigorous offensive will be necessary.

The immediate theatre of operations, the critical strategic area, need not be, and often ought
not to be, near the territory defended by our navy. It is necessary to dwell upon this, because
no principle of naval warfare has been more frequently or more seriously misapprehended. Misapprehension
of it has led to mischievous and dangerous distribution of naval force and to the squandering
of immense sums of money on local defence vessels; that is, vessels only capable of operating
in the very waters from which every effort should be made to exclude the enemy. Failure to
exclude him from them can only be regarded as, at the very least, yielding to him an important
point in the great game of war. If we succeed in keeping him away, the local defence craft
of every class are useless, and the money spent on them has been worse than wasted, because,
if it had not been so spent, it might have been devoted to strengthening the kind of force
which must be used to keep the enemy where he ought to be kept, viz. at a distance from our
own waters.

The demand that ships be so stationed that they will generally, and except when actually cruising,
be within sight of the inhabitants, is common enough in the mother country, and perhaps even
more common in the over-sea parts of the British Empire. Nothing justifies it but the honest
ignorance of those who make it; nothing explains compliance with it but the deplorable weakness
of authorities who yield to it. It was not by hanging about the coast of England, when there
was no enemy near it, with his fleet, that Hawke or Nelson saved the country from invasion,
nor was it by remaining where they could be seen by the fellow-countrymen of their crews that
the French and English fleets shut up their enemy in the Baltic and Black Sea, and thus gained
and kept undisputed command of the sea which enabled them, without interruption, to invade
their enemy's territory.

The condition insisted upon by the Australasian Governments in the agreement formerly made
with the Home Government, that a certain number of ships, in return for an annual contribution
of money, should always remain in Australasian waters, was in reality greatly against the interests
of that part of the empire. The Australasian taxpayer was, in fact, made to insist upon being
injured in return for his money. The proceeding would have been exactly paralleled by a householder
who might insist that a fire-engine, maintained out of rates to which he contributes, should
always be kept within a few feet of his front door, and not be allowed to proceed to the end
of the street to extinguish a fire threatening to extend eventually to the householder's own
dwelling. When still further localised naval defence--localised defence, that is, of what may
be called the smaller description--is considered, the danger involved in adopting it will be
quite as apparent, and the waste of money will be more obvious. Localised defence is a near
relation of passive defence. It owes its origin to the same sentiment, viz. a belief in the
efficacy of staying where you are instead of carrying the war into the enemy's country.

There may be cases in which no other kind of naval defence is practicable. The immense costliness
of modern navies puts it out of the power of smaller states to maintain considerable sea-going
fleets. The historic maritime countries--Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the
performances of whose seamen are so justly celebrated--could not now send to sea a force equal
in number and fighting efficiency to a quarter of the force possessed by anyone of the chief
naval powers. The countries named, when determined not to expose themselves unarmed to an assailant,
can provide themselves only with a kind of defence which, whatever its detailed composition,
must be of an intrinsically localised character.

In their case there is nothing else to be done; and in their case defence of the character
specified would be likely to prove more efficacious than it could be expected to be elsewhere.
War is usually made in pursuit of an object valuable enough to justify the risks inseparable
from the attempt to gain it. Aggression by any of the countries that have been mentioned is
too improbable to call for serious apprehension. Aggression against them is far more likely.
What they have to do is to make the danger of attacking them so great that it will equal or
outweigh any advantage that could be gained by conquering them. Their wealth and resources,
compared with those of great aggressive states, are not large enough to make up for much loss
in war on the part of the latter engaging in attempts to seize them. Therefore, what the small
maritime countries have to do is to make the form of naval defence to which they are restricted
efficacious enough to hurt an aggressor so much that the victory which he may feel certain
of gaining will be quite barren. He will get no glory, even in these days of self-advertisement,
from the conquest of such relatively weak antagonists; and the plunder will not suffice to
repay him for the damage received in effecting it.

The case of a member of the great body known as the British Empire is altogether different.
Its conquest would probably be enormously valuable to a conqueror; its ruin immensely damaging
to the body as a whole. Either would justify an enemy in running considerable risks, and would
afford him practically sufficient compensation for considerable losses incurred. We may expect
that, in war, any chance of accomplishing either purpose will not be neglected. Provision must,
therefore, be made against the eventuality. Let us for the moment suppose that, like one of
the smaller countries whose case has been adduced, we are restricted to localised defence.
An enemy not so restricted would be able to get, without being molested, as near to our territory--whether
in the mother country or elsewhere--as the outer edge of the comparatively narrow belt of water
that our localised defences could have any hope of controlling effectively. We should have
abandoned to him the whole of the ocean except a relatively minute strip of coast-waters. That
would be equivalent to saying good-bye to the maritime commerce on which our wealth wholly,
and our existence largely, depends. No thoughtful British subject would find this tolerable.
Everyone would demand the institution of a different defence system. A change, therefore, to
the more active system would be inevitable. It would begin with the introduction of a cruising
force in addition to the localised force. The unvarying lesson of naval history would be that
the cruising division should gain continuously on the localised. It is only in times of peace,
when men have forgotten, or cannot be made to understand, what war is, that the opposite takes
place.

If it be hoped that a localised force will render coast-wise traffic safe from the enemy, a
little knowledge of what has happened in war and a sufficiently close investigation of conditions
will demonstrate how baseless the hope must be. Countries not yet thickly populated would be
in much the same condition as the countries of western Europe a century ago, the similarity
being due to the relative scarcity of good land communications. A part--probably not a very
large part--of the articles required by the people dwelling on and near the coast in one section
would be drawn from another similar section. These articles could be most conveniently and
cheaply transported by water. If it were worth his while, an enemy disposing of an active cruising
force strong enough to make its way into the neighbourhood of the coast waters concerned would
interrupt the 'long-shore traffic' and defy the efforts of a localised force to prevent him.
The history of the Great War at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the
nineteenth teems with instances of interruption by our navy of the enemy's coast-wise trade
when his ocean trade had been destroyed. The history of the American War of 1812 supplies other
instances.

The localised defence could not attempt to drive off hostile cruisers remaining far from the
shore and meaning to infest the great lines of maritime communication running towards it. If
those cruisers are to be driven off at all it can be done only by cruising ships. Unless, therefore,
we are to be content to leave our ocean routes, where most crowded and therefore most vulnerable,
to the mercy of an enemy, we must have cruisers to meet the hostile cruisers. If we still adhere
to our localised defence, we shall have two distinct kinds of force---one provided merely for
local, and consequently restricted, action; the other able to act near the shore or far out
at sea as circumstances may demand. If we go to the expense of providing both kinds, we shall
have followed the example of the sage who cut a large hole in his study door for the cat and
a small one for the kitten.

Is local naval defence, then, of any use? Well, to tell the truth, not much; and only in rare
and exceptional circumstances. Even in the case of the smaller maritime countries, to which
reference has been made above, defence of the character in question would avail little if a
powerful assailant were resolved to press home his attack. That is to say, if only absolute
belligerent considerations were regarded. In war, however, qualifying considerations can never
be left out of sight. As the great Napoleon observed, you can no more make war without incurring
losses than you can make omelettes without breaking eggs. The strategist--and the tactician
also, within his province--will always count the cost of a proposed operation, even where they
are nearly certain of success. The occupation of a country, which would be of no great practical
value to you when you got it, would be a poor return for the loss to which you would have been
put in the process. That loss might, and probably would, leave you at a great disadvantage
as regards enemies more nearly on an equality with yourself. It would, therefore, not be the
improbability of breaking down the local naval defence of a minor maritime state, but the pressure
of qualifying and only indirectly belligerent considerations, that would prevent its being
attempted.

In a struggle between two antagonists of the first rank, the circumstances would be different.
Purely belligerent considerations would have fuller play. Mistakes will be made, of course,
for war is full of mistakes; but it may be accepted that an attack on any position, however
defended, is in itself proof that the assailant believed the result hoped for to be quite worth
the cost of obtaining it. Consequently, in a struggle as assumed, every mode of defence would
have to stand on its intrinsic merits, nearly or quite unaided by the influence of considerations
more or less foreign to it. Every scrap of local defence would, in proportion to its amount,
be a diminution of the offensive defence. Advocates of the former may be challenged to produce
from naval history any instance of local naval defence succeeding against the assaults of an
actively aggressive navy. In the late war between Japan and Russia the Russian local defence
failed completely.

In the last case, a class of vessel like that which had failed in local defence was used successfully,
because offensively, by the Japanese. This and many another instance show that the right way
to use the kind of craft so often allocated to local defence is to use them offensively. It
is only thus that their adoption by a great maritime power like the British Empire can be justified.
The origin and centre of our naval strength are to be looked for in the United Kingdom. The
shores of the latter are near the shores of other great maritime powers. Its ports, especially
those at which its fleets are equipped and would be likely to assemble on the imminence of
war, are within reach of more than one foreign place from which small swift craft to be used
offensively might be expected to issue. The method of frustrating the efforts of these craft
giving most promise of success is to attack them as soon as possible after they issue from
their own port. To the acceptance of this principle we owe the origin of the destroyer, devised
to destroy hostile torpedo-boats before they could reach a position from which they would be
able to discharge with effect their special weapon against our assembled ships. It is true
that the destroyer has been gradually converted into a larger torpedo-boat. It is also true
that when used as such in local defence, as at Port Arthur, her failure was complete; and just
as true that she has never accomplished anything except when used offensively.

When, therefore, a naval country's coast is so near the ports of another naval country that
the latter would be able with swift small craft to attack the former's shipping, the provision
of craft of a similar kind is likely to prove advantageous. War between great powers is a two-sided
game, and what one side can do the other will at least be likely to attempt. Nothing supports
the view that it is well--either above or beneath the surface of the water--to stand on the
defensive and await attack. Everything points to the superiority of the plan of beating up
the enemy's quarters and attacking him before he can get far from them on his way towards his
objective. Consequently the only justification of expending money on the localised vessels
of which we have been speaking, is the probability that an enemy would have some of his bases
within reach of those vessels' efforts. Where this condition does not exist, the money expended
is, from the belligerent point of view, thrown away. Here comes in the greatest foe of belligerent
efficiency, viz. political expediency. In time of peace it is thought better to conciliate
voters than to prepare to meet an enemy. If local defence is thought to be pleasing to an inexpert
electorate, it is only too likely to be provided, no matter how ineffectual and how costly
in reality it will turn out to be.

Not only is the British Empire the first of naval powers, it is also the first of colonial
powers. One attribute is closely connected with the other; neither, without the other, would
be applicable. The magnitude of our colonial domain, and especially the imposing aspects of
some of its greater components--the Dominion, the Commonwealth, South Africa, New Zealand--are
apt to blind us to a feature of great strategical importance, and that is the abundance and
excellence of the naval bases that stud our ocean lines of communication. In thinking of the
great daughter states we are liable to forget these; yet our possession of them helps greatly
to strengthen our naval position, because it facilitates our assuming a far-reaching offensive.
By themselves, if not too numerous, they can afford valuable support to the naval operations
that are likely to prove most beneficial to us. The fact that they are ours, and not an opponent's,
also constitutes for us an advantage of importance. Of course, they have to be defended, or
else they may fall into an opponent's hands. Have we here a case in which highly localised
or even passive defences are desirable? No doubt we did act for a time as though we believed
that the question could only be answered in the affirmative; but that was when we were under
the influence of the feelings engendered by observation of the long series of land wars previously
discussed.

Perhaps we have not yet quite shaken off the effects of that influence; but we have at least
got so far as to tolerate the statement of the other side of the question. It would be a great
mistake to suppose that the places alluded to are meant to be ports of refuge for our ships.
Though they were to serve that purpose occasionally in the case of isolated merchant vessels,
it would be but an accident, and not the essence, of their existence. What they are meant for
is to be utilised as positions where our men-of-war can make reasonably sure of finding supplies
and the means of refit. This assurance will largely depend upon their power of resistance if
attacked. Before we can decide how to impart that power to them we shall have to see the kind
of attack against which they would have to be prepared. If they are on a continent, like, for
example, Gibraltar, attack on them by a land force, however improbable, is physically possible.
Against an attack of the kind a naval force could give little direct help. Most of our outlying
naval bases are really or virtually insular, and are open to attack only by an expedition coming
across the sea. An essential characteristic of a naval base is that it should be able to furnish
supplies as wanted to the men-of-war needing to replenish their stocks. Some, and very often
all, of these supplies are not of native production and must be brought to the base by sea.
If the enemy can stop their conveyance to it, the place is useless as a base and the enemy
is really in control of its communications. If he is in control of its communications he can
send against it as great an expedition as he likes, and the place will be captured or completely
neutralised. Similarly, if we control the communications, not only can supplies be conveyed
to it, but also no hostile expedition will be allowed to reach it. Thus the primary defence
of the outlying base is the active, sea-going fleet. Moderate local defence, chiefly of the
human kind, in the shape of a garrison, will certainly be needed. Though the enemy has not
been able to obtain control of the communications of the place, fitful raids on it will be
possible; and the place should be fortified enough and garrisoned enough to hold out against
the inconsiderable assaults comprised in these till our own ships can drive the enemy's away.

Outlying naval bases, though but moderately fortified, that contain depots of stores, docks,
and other conveniences, have the vice of all immobile establishments. When war does come, some
of them almost certainly, and all of them possibly, may not be in the right place with regard
to the critical area of operations. They cannot, however, be moved. It will be necessary to
do what has been done over and over again in war, in the latest as well as in earlier wars,
and that is, establish temporary bases in more convenient situations. Thus much, perhaps all,
of the cost and trouble of establishing and maintaining the permanent bases will have been
wasted. This inculcates the necessity of having not as many bases as can be found, but as few
as it is possible to get on with.

The control of ocean communications, or the command of the sea, being the end of naval warfare,
and its acquisition being practicable only by the assumption of a vigorous offensive, it follows
as a matter of course that we must have a strong and in all respects efficient mobile navy.
This is the fundamental condition on which the continued existence of the British Empire depends.
It is thoroughly well known to every foreign Government, friendly or unfriendly. The true objective
in naval warfare is the enemy's navy. That must be destroyed or decisively defeated, or intimidated
into remaining in its ports. Not one of these can be effected without a mobile, that is a sea-going,
fleet. The British Empire may fall to pieces from causes as yet unknown or unsuspected: it
cannot be kept together if it loses the power of gaining command of the sea. This is not a
result of deliberate policy: it is inherent in the nature of the empire, scattered as its parts
are throughout the world, with only the highway of the sea between them.

Such is the position of the fleet in the defence of the empire: such are its duties towards
it. Duties in the case are mutual, and some are owed to the fleet as well as by it. It is incumbent
on every section of the empire, without neglecting its land forces, to lend zealous help in
keeping the fleet efficient. It is not to be supposed that this can be done only by making
pecuniary contributions to its maintenance. It is, indeed, very doubtful if any real good can
be done by urging colonies to make them. It seems certain that the objections to this are greater
than any benefit that it can confer. Badgering our fellow-subjects beyond sea for money payments
towards the cost of the navy is undignified and impolitic. The greatest sum asked for by the
most exacting postulant would not equal a twentieth part of the imperial naval expenditure,
and would not save the taxpayer of the mother country a farthing in the pound of his income.
No one has yet been able to establish the equity of a demand that would take something from
the inhabitants of one colony and nothing from those of another. Adequate voluntary contribution
is a different matter.

There are other ways in which every trans-marine possession of the Crown can lend a hand towards
perfecting the efficiency of the fleet--ways, too, which would leave each in complete and unmenaced
control of its own money. Sea-power does not consist entirely of men-of-war. There must be
docks, refitting establishments, magazines, and depots of stores. Ports, which men-of-war must
visit at least occasionally in war for repair or replenishment of supplies, will have to be
made secure against the assaults which it has been said that a hastily raiding enemy, notwithstanding
our general control of the communications, might find a chance of making. Moderate fixed fortifications
are all the passive defence that would be needed; but good and active troops must be available.
If all these are not provided by the part of the empire in which the necessary naval bases
lie, they will have to be provided by the mother country. If the former provides them the latter
will be spared the expense of doing so, and spared expense with no loss of dignity, and with
far less risk of friction and inconvenience than if her taxpayers' pockets had been nominally
spared to the extent of a trifling and reluctantly paid money contribution.

It has been pointed out on an earlier page that a country can be, and most probably will be,
more effectually defended in a maritime war if its fleet operates at a distance from, rather
than near, its shores. Every subject of our King should long to see this condition exist if
ever the empire is involved in hostilities. It may be--for who can tell what war will bring?--that
the people of some great trans-marine dependency will have to choose between allowing a campaign
to be conducted in their country or forcing the enemy to tolerate it in his. If they choose
the latter they must be prepared to furnish part at least of the mobile force that can give
effect to their choice. That is to say, they must be prepared to back up our sea-power in its
efforts to keep off the tide of war from the neighbourhood of their homes. History shows how
rarely, during the struggle between European nations for predominance in North America, the
more settled parts of our former American Colonies were the theatre of war: but then the colonists
of those days, few comparatively as they were, sent strong contingents to the armies that went
campaigning, in the territory of the various enemies. This was in every way better--the sequel
proved how much better--than a money contribution begged or extorted would have been.

Helping in the manner first suggested need not result in dissociating our fellow-subjects beyond
the seas from participation in the work of the active sea-going fleet. It is now, and still
would be, open to them as much as to any native or denizen of the mother country. The time
has fully come when the people of the greater outlying parts of the empire should insist upon
perfect equality of treatment with their home fellow-subjects in this matter. They should resent,
as a now quite out-of-date and invidious distinction, any difference in qualification for entry,
locality of service, or remuneration for any rank or rating. Self-respect and a dignified confidence
in their own qualities, the excellence of which has been thoroughly tested, will prompt the
King's colonial subjects to ask for nothing but equal chances in a force on which is laid so
large a part of the duty of defending the empire. Why should they cut themselves off from the
promising career that service in the Royal Navy opens to the capable, the zealous, and the
honourable aspirant of every grade? Some of the highest posts in the navy are now, or lately
have been, held by men who not only happened to be born in British Colonies, but who also belong
to resident colonial families. Surely in this there is a strong moral cement for binding and
keeping the empire together. It is unnecessary to expatiate on the contrast between the prospect
of such a career and that which is all that a small local service could offer. It would soon
be seen towards which the enterprising and the energetic would instinctively gravitate.

In the defence of the British Empire the fleet holds a twofold position. To its general belligerent
efficiency, its strength and activity, we must look if the plans of an enemy are to be brought
to nought. It, and it only, can secure for us the control of the ocean communications, on the
freedom of which from serious interruptions the prosperity--indeed, the existence--of a scattered
body must depend. In time of peace it can be made a great consolidating force, fostering every
sentiment of worthy local patriotism whilst obliterating all inclination to mischievous narrow
particularism, and tending to perfect the unity which gives virtue to national grandeur and
is the true secret of national independence and strength.

XI

NAVAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS AT THE TIME OF TRAFALGAR[91]

[Footnote 91: Written in 1905. (Read at Institute of Naval Architects.)]

The subject on which I have been invited to read a paper, and which is taken as the title of
the latter, would require for anything like full discussion a much longer time than you can
be expected to allot to it. To discuss it adequately, a volume of no diminutive size would
be necessary. It may, however, be possible to indicate with the brevity appropriate to the
occasion the main outlines of the subject, and to suggest for your consideration certain points
which, over and above their historical interest, may furnish us with valuable guidance at the
present day.

In taking account of the conditions of the Trafalgar epoch we have to note two distinct but,
of course, closely related matters. These are the strategic plan of the enemy and the strategic
plan adopted to meet it by the British. The former of these was described in the House of Commons
by William Pitt at the beginning of the war in words which may be used without change at the
present time. On 16th May 1803 the war, which had been interrupted by the unstable Peace of
Amiens, was definitely resumed. The struggle was now to be a war not so much between the United
Kingdom and the French nation as between the United Kingdom and the great Napoleon, wielding
more than the resources of France alone. Speaking a week after the declaration of war, Pitt
said that any expectation of success which the enemy might have must be based on the supposition
that he could break the spirit or weaken the determination of the country by harassing us with
the perpetual apprehension of descents on our coasts; or else that our resources could be impaired
and our credit undermined by the effects of an expensive and protracted war. More briefly stated,
the hostile plan was to invade the United Kingdom, ruin our maritime trade, and expel us from
our over-sea possessions, especially in the East, from which it was supposed our wealth was
chiefly derived. The plan was comprehensive, but not easily concealed. What we had to do was
to prevent the invasion of the United Kingdom and defend our trade and our outlying territories.
As not one of the hostile objects could be attained except by making a maritime expedition
of some kind, that is to say, by an expedition which had to cross more or less extensive areas
of water, it necessarily followed that our most effective method of defence was the keeping
open of our sea communications. It became necessary for us to make such arrangements that the
maritime paths by which a hostile expedition could approach our home-coasts, or hostile cruisers
molest our sea-borne trade, or hostile squadrons move to the attack of our trans-marine dependencies--that
all these paths should be so defended by our navy that either the enemy would not venture to
traverse them or, if he did, that he could be driven off.

Short as it is, the time at my disposal permits me to give a few details. It was fully recognised
that defence of the United Kingdom against invasion could not be secured by naval means alone.
As in the times of Queen Elizabeth, so in those of George III, no seaman of reputation contended
that a sufficient land force could be dispensed with. Our ablest seamen always held that small
hostile expeditions could be prepared in secret and might be able to slip through the most
complete lines of naval defence that we could hope to maintain. It was not discovered or alleged
till the twentieth century that the crew of a dinghy could not land in this country in the
face of the navy. Therefore an essential feature of our defensive strategy was the provision
of land forces in such numbers that an invader would have no chance of succeeding except he
came in strength so great that his preparations could not be concealed and his expedition could
not cross the water unseen.

As our mercantile marine was to be found in nearly every sea, though in greater accumulation
in some areas than in others, its defence against the assaults of an enemy could only be ensured
by the virtual ubiquity of our cruising force. This, of course, involved the necessity of employing
a large number of cruisers, and of arranging the distribution of them in accordance with the
relative amount and value of the traffic to be protected from molestation in different parts
of the ocean. It may be mentioned here that the term 'cruiser,' at the time with which we are
dealing, was not limited to frigates and smaller classes of vessels. It included also ships
of the line, it being the old belief of the British Navy, justified by the experience of many
campaigns and consecrated by the approval of our greatest admirals, that the value of a ship
of war was directly proportionate to her capacity for cruising and keeping the sea.

If the ocean paths used by our merchant ships--the trade routes or sea communications of the
United Kingdom with friendly or neutral markets and areas of production--could be kept open
by our navy, that is, made so secure that our trade could traverse them with so little risk
of molestation that it could continue to be carried on, it resulted as a matter of course that
no sustained attack could be made on our outlying territory. Where this was possible it was
where we had failed to keep open the route or line of communications, in which case the particular
trade following it was, at least temporarily, destroyed, and the territory to which the route
led was either cut off or seized. Naturally, when this was perceived, efforts were made to
re-open and keep open the endangered or interrupted communication line.

Napoleon, notwithstanding his supereminent genius, made some extraordinary mistakes about warfare
on the sea. The explanation of this has been given by a highly distinguished French admiral.
The Great Emperor, he says, was wanting in exact appreciation of the difficulties of naval
operations. He never understood that the naval officer--alone of all men in the world--must
be master of two distinct professions. The naval officer must be as completely a seaman as
an officer in any mercantile marine; and, in addition to this, he must be as accomplished in
the use of the material of war entrusted to his charge as the members of any aimed force in
the world. The Emperor's plan for the invasion of the United Kingdom was conceived on a grand
scale. A great army, eventually 130,000 strong, was collected on the coast of north-eastern
France, with its headquarters at Boulogne. The numerical strength of this army is worth attention.
By far the larger part of it was to have made the first descent on our territory; the remainder
was to be a reserve to follow as quickly as possible. It has been doubted if Napoleon really
meant to invade this country, the suggestion being that his collection of an army on the shores
of the Straits of Dover and the English Channel was merely a 'blind' to cover another intended
movement. The overwhelming weight of authoritative opinion is in favour of the view that the
project of invasion was real. It is highly significant that he considered so large a number
of troops necessary. It could not have been governed by any estimate of the naval obstruction
to be encountered during the sea passage of the expedition, but only by the amount of the land
force likely to be met if the disembarkation on our shores could be effected. The numerical
strength in troops which Napoleon thought necessary compelled him to make preparations on so
great a scale that concealment became quite impossible. Consequently an important part of his
plan was disclosed to us betimes, and the threatened locality indicated to us within comparatively
narrow limits of precision.

Notwithstanding his failure to appreciate all the difficulties of naval warfare, the Great
Emperor had grasped one of its leading principles. Before the Peace of Amiens, indeed before
his campaign in Egypt, and even his imposing triumphs in Italy, he had seen that the invasion
of the United Kingdom was impracticable without first obtaining the command of the sea. His
strategic plan, therefore, included arrangements to secure this. The details of the plan were
changed from time to time as conditions altered; but the main object was adhered to until the
final abandonment of the whole scheme under pressure of circumstances as embodied in Nelson
and his victorious brothers-in-arms. The gunboats, transport boats, and other small craft,
which to the number of many hundreds filled the ports of north-eastern France and the Netherlands,
were not the only naval components of the expedition. Fleets of line-of-battle ships were essential
parts of it, and on their effective action the success of the scheme was largely made to depend.
This feature remained unaltered in principle when, less than twelve months before Trafalgar,
Spain took part in the war as Napoleon's ally, and brought him a great reinforcement of ships
and important assistance in money.

We should not fail to notice that, before he considered himself strong enough to undertake
the invasion of the United Kingdom, Napoleon found it necessary to have at his disposal the
resources of other countries besides France, notwithstanding that by herself France had a population
more than 60 per cent. greater than that of England. By the alliance with Spain he had added
largely to the resources on which he could draw. Moreover, his strategic position was geographically
much improved. With the exception of that of Portugal, the coast of western continental Europe,
from the Texel to Leghorn, and somewhat later to Taranto also, was united in hostility to us.
This complicated the strategic problem which the British Navy had to solve, as it increased
the number of points to be watched; and it facilitated the junction of Napoleon's Mediterranean
naval forces with those assembled in his Atlantic ports by supplying him with allied ports
of refuge and refit on Spanish territory--such as Cartagena or Cadiz--between Toulon and the
Bay of Biscay. Napoleon, therefore, enforced upon us by the most convincing of all arguments
the necessity of maintaining the British Navy at the 'two-power standard' at least. The lesson
had been taught us long before by Philip II, who did not venture on an attempt at invading
this country till he was master of the resources of the whole Iberian peninsula as well as
of those of the Spanish dominions in Italy, in the Burgundian heritage, and in the distant
regions across the Atlantic Ocean.

At several points on the long stretch of coast of which he was now the master, Napoleon equipped
fleets that were to unite and win for him the command of the sea during a period long enough
to permit the unobstructed passage of his invading army across the water which separated the
starting points of his expedition from the United Kingdom. Command of the sea to be won by
a powerful naval combination was thus an essential element in Napoleon's strategy at the time
of Trafalgar. It was not in deciding what was essential that this soldier of stupendous ability
erred: it was in choosing the method of gaining the essential that he went wrong. The British
strategy adopted in opposition to that of Napoleon was based on the acquisition and preservation
of the command of the sea. Formulated and carried into effect by seamen, it differed in some
important features from his. We may leave out of sight for the moment the special arrangements
made in the English Channel to oppose the movements of Napoleon's flotillas of gunboats, transport
boats, and other small craft. The British strategy at the time of Trafalgar, as far as it was
concerned with opposition to Napoleon's sea-going fleets, may be succinctly described as stationing
off each of the ports in which the enemy's forces were lying a fleet or squadron of suitable
strength. Though some of our admirals, notably Nelson himself, objected to the application
of the term 'blockade' to their plans, the hostile ships were to this extent blockaded, that
if they should come out they would find outside their port a British force sufficient to drive
them in again, or even to defeat them thoroughly and destroy them. Beating them and thus having
done with them, and not simply shutting them up in harbour, was what was desired by our admirals.
This necessitated a close watch on the hostile ports; and how consistently that was maintained
let the history of Cornwallis's command off Brest and of Nelson's off Toulon suffice to tell us.

The junction of two or more of Napoleon's fleets would have ensured over almost any single
British fleet a numerical superiority that would have rendered the defeat or retirement of
the latter almost certain. To meet this condition the British strategy contemplated the falling
back, if necessary, of one of our detachments on another, which might be carried further and
junction with a third detachment be effected. By this step we should preserve, if not a numerical
superiority over the enemy, at least so near an equality of force as to render his defeat probable
and his serious maltreatment, even if undefeated, a certainty. The strategic problem before
our navy was, however, not quite so easy as this might make it seem. The enemy's concentration
might be attempted either towards Brest or towards Toulon. In the latter case, a superior force
might fall upon our Mediterranean fleet before our watching ships in the Atlantic could discover
the escape of the enemy's ships from the Atlantic port or could follow and come up with them.
Against the probability of this was to be set the reluctance of Napoleon to carry out an eccentric
operation which a concentration off Toulon would necessitate, when the essence of his scheme
was to concentrate in a position from which he could obtain naval control of the English Channel.

After the addition of the Spanish Navy to his own, Napoleon to some extent modified his strategic
arrangements. The essential feature of the scheme remained unaltered. It was to effect the
junction of the different parts of his naval force and thereupon to dominate the situation,
by evading the several British fleets or detachments which were watching his. Before Spain
joined him in the war his intention was that his escaping fleets should go out into the Atlantic,
behind the backs, as it were, of the British ships, and then make for the English Channel.
When he had the aid of Spain the point of junction was to be in the West Indies.

The remarkable thing about this was the evident belief that the command of the sea might be
won without fighting for it; won, too, from the British Navy which was ready, and indeed wished,
to fight. We now see that Napoleon's naval strategy at the time of Trafalgar, whilst it aimed
at gaining command of the sea, was based on what has been called evasion. The fundamental principle
of the British naval strategy of that time was quite different. So far from thinking that the
contest could be settled without one or more battles, the British admirals, though nominally
blockading his ports, gave the enemy every facility for coming out in order that they might
be able to bring him to action. Napoleon, on the contrary, declared that a battle would be
useless, and distinctly ordered his officers not to fight one. Could it be that, when pitted
against admirals whose accurate conception of the conditions of naval warfare had been over
and over again tested during the hostilities ended by the Peace of Amiens, Napoleon still trusted
to the efficacy of methods which had proved so successful when he was outmanoeuvring and intimidating
the generals who opposed him in North Italy? We can only explain his attitude in the campaign
of Trafalgar by attributing to him an expectation that the British seamen of his day, tried
as they had been in the fire of many years of war, would succumb to his methods as readily
as the military formalists of central Europe.

Napoleon had at his disposal between seventy and eighty French, Dutch, and Spanish ships of
the line, of which some sixty-seven were available at the beginning of the Trafalgar campaign.
In January 1805, besides other ships of the class in distant waters or specially employed,
we--on our side--had eighty ships of the line in commission. A knowledge of this will enable
us to form some idea of the chances of success that would have attended Napoleon's concentration
if it had been effected. To protect the passage of his invading expedition across the English
Channel he did not depend only on concentrating his more distant fleets. In the Texel there
were, besides smaller vessels, nine sail of the line. Thus the Emperor did what we may be sure
any future intending invader will not fail to do, viz. he provided his expedition with a respectable
naval escort. The British naval officers of the day, who knew what war was, made arrangements
to deal with this escort. Lord Keith, who commanded in the Downs, had under him six sail of
the line in addition to many frigates and sloops; and there were five more line-of-battle ships
ready at Spithead if required.

There had been a demand in the country that the defence of our shores against an invading expedition
should be entrusted to gunboats, and what may be called coastal small craft and boats. This
was resisted by the naval officers. Nelson had already said, 'Our first defence is close to
the enemy's ports,' thus agreeing with a long line of eminent British seamen in their view
of our strategy. The Government of the day insisted on having the coastal boats; but St. Vincent
succeeded in postponing the preparation of them till the cruising ships had been manned. His
plan of defence has been described by his biographer as 'a triple line of barricade; 50-gun
ships, frigates, sloops of war, and gun-vessels upon the coast of the enemy; in the Downs opposite
France another squadron, but of powerful ships of the line, continually disposable, to support
the former or attack any force of the enemy which, it might be imagined possible, might slip
through the squadron hanging over the coast; and a force on the beach on all the shores of
the English ports, to render assurance doubly sure.' This last item was the one that St. Vincent
had been compelled to adopt, and he was careful that it should be in addition to those measures
of defence in the efficacy of which he and his brother seamen believed. Concerning it his biographer
makes the following remark: 'It is to be noted that Lord St. Vincent did not contemplate repelling
an invasion of gunboats by gunboats,' &c. He objected to the force of sea-fencibles, or long-shore
organisation, because he considered it more useful to have the sea-going ships manned. Speaking
of this coastal defence scheme, he said: 'It would be a good bone for the officers to pick,
but a very dear one for the country.'

The defence of our ocean trade entered largely into the strategy of the time. An important
part was played by our fleets and groups of line-of-battle ships which gave usually indirect,
but sometimes direct, protection to our own merchant vessels, and also to neutral vessels carrying
commodities to or from British ports. The strategy of the time, the correctness of which was
confirmed by long belligerent experience, rejected the employment of a restricted number of
powerful cruisers, and relied upon the practical ubiquity of the defending ships, which ubiquity
was rendered possible by the employment of very numerous craft of moderate size. This can be
seen in the lists of successive years. In January 1803 the number of cruising frigates in commission
was 107, and of sloops and smaller vessels 139, the total being 246. In 1804 the numbers were:
Frigates, 108; sloops, &c., 181; with a total of 289. In 1805 the figures had grown to 129
frigates, 416 sloops, &c., the total being 545. Most of these were employed in defending commerce.
We all know how completely Napoleon's project of invading the United Kingdom was frustrated.
It is less well known that the measures for defending our sea-borne trade, indicated by the
figures just given, were triumphantly successful. Our mercantile marine increased during the
war, a sure proof that it had been effectually defended. Consequently we may accept it as established
beyond the possibility of refutation that that branch of our naval strategy at the time of
Trafalgar which was concerned with the defence of our trade was rightly conceived and properly
carried into effect.

As has been stated already, the defence of our sea-borne trade, being in practice the keeping
open of our ocean lines of communication, carried with it the protection, in part at any rate,
of our transmarine territories. Napoleon held pertinaciously to the belief that British prosperity
was chiefly due to our position in India. We owe it to Captain Mahan that we now know that
the eminent American Fulton--a name of interest to the members of this Institution--told Pitt
of the belief held abroad that 'the fountains of British wealth are in India and China.' In
the great scheme of naval concentration which the Emperor devised, seizure of British Colonies
in the West Indies had a definite place. We kept in that quarter, and varied as necessary,
a force capable of dealing with a naval raid as well as guarding the neighbouring lines of
communication. In 1803 we had four ships of the line in the West Indian area. In 1804 we had
six of the same class; and in 1805, while the line-of-battle ships were reduced to four, the
number of frigates was increased from nine to twenty-five. Whether our Government divined Napoleon's
designs on India or not, it took measures to protect our interests there. In January 1804 we
had on the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies stations, both together, six sail of the line,
three smaller two-deckers, six frigates, and six sloops, or twenty-one ships of war in all.
This would have been sufficient to repel a raiding attack made in some strength. By the beginning
of 1805 our East Indies force had been increased; and in the year 1805 itself we raised it
to a strength of forty-one ships in all, of which nine were of the line and seventeen were
frigates. Had, therefore, any of the hostile ships managed to get to the East Indies from the
Atlantic or the Mediterranean ports, in which they were being watched by our navy, their chances
of succeeding in their object would have been small indeed.

When we enter the domain of tactics strictly so-called, that is to say, when we discuss the
proceedings of naval forces--whether single ships, squadrons, or fleets--in hostile contact
with one another, we find the time of Trafalgar full of instructive episodes. Even with the
most recent experience of naval warfare vividly present to our minds, we can still regard Nelson
as the greatest of tacticians. Naval tactics may be roughly divided into two great classes
or sections, viz. the tactics of groups of ships, that is to say, fleet actions; and the tactics
of what the historian James calls 'single ship actions,' that is to say, fights between two
individual ships. In the former the achievements of Nelson stand out with incomparable brilliancy.
It would be impossible to describe his method fully in such a paper as this. We may, however,
say that Nelson was an innovator, and that his tactical principles and methods have been generally
misunderstood down to this very day. If ever there was an admiral who was opposed to an unthinking,
headlong rush at an enemy, it was he. Yet this is the character that he still bears in the
conception of many. He was, in truth, an industrious and patient student of tactics, having
studied them, in what in these days we should call a scientific spirit, at an early period,
when there was but little reason to expect that he would ever be in a position to put to a
practical test the knowledge that he had acquired and the ideas that he had formed. He saw
that the old battle formation in single line-ahead was insufficient if you wanted--as he himself
always did--to gain an overwhelming victory. He also saw that, though an improvement on the
old formation, Lord Howe's method of the single line-abreast was still a good deal short of
tactical perfection. Therefore, he devised what he called, with pardonable elation, the 'Nelson
touch,' the attack in successive lines so directed as to overwhelm one part of the enemy's
fleet, whilst the other part was prevented from coming to the assistance of the first, and
was in its turn overwhelmed or broken up. His object was to bring a larger number of his own
ships against a smaller number of the enemy's. He would by this method destroy the part attacked,
suffering in the process so little damage himself that with his whole force he would be able
to deal effectively with the hostile remnant if it ventured to try conclusions with him. It
is of the utmost importance that we should thoroughly understand Nelson's fundamental tactical
principle, viz. the bringing of a larger number of ships to fight against a smaller number
of the enemy's. There is not, I believe, in the whole of the records of Nelson's opinions and
actions a single expression tending to show that tactical efficiency was considered by him
to be due to superiority in size of individual ships of the same class or--as far as matériel
was concerned--to anything but superior numbers, of course at the critical point. He did not
require, and did not have, more ships in his own fleet than the whole of those in the fleet
of the enemy. What he wanted was to bring to the point of impact, when the fight began, a larger
number of ships than were to be found in that part of the enemy's line.

I believe that I am right in saying that, from the date of Salamis downwards, history records
no decisive naval victory in which the victorious fleet has not succeeded in concentrating
against a relatively weak point in its enemy's formation a greater number of its own ships.
I know of nothing to show that this has not been the rule throughout the ages of which detailed
history furnishes us with any memorial--no matter what the class of ship, what the type of
weapon, what the mode of propulsion. The rule certainly prevailed in the battle of the 10th
August 1904 off Port Arthur, though it was not so overwhelmingly decisive as some others. We
may not even yet know enough of the sea fight in the Straits of Tsushima to be able to describe
it in detail; but we do know that at least some of the Russian ships were defeated or destroyed
by a combination of Japanese ships against them.

Looking back at the tactics of the Trafalgar epoch, we may see that the history of them confirms
the experience of earlier wars, viz. that victory does not necessarily fall to the side which
has the biggest ships. It is a well-known fact of naval history that generally the French ships
were larger and the Spanish much larger than the British ships of corresponding classes. This
superiority in size certainly did not carry with it victory in action. On the other hand, British
ships were generally bigger than the Dutch ships with which they fought; and it is of great
significance that at Camperdown the victory was due, not to superiority in the size of individual
ships, but, as shown by the different lists of killed and wounded, to the act of bringing a
larger number against a smaller. All that we have been able to learn of the occurrences in
the battle of the japan Sea supports instead of being opposed to this conclusion; and it may
be said that there is nothing tending to upset it in the previous history of the present war
in the Far East.

I do not know how far I am justified in expatiating on this point; but, as it may help to bring
the strategy and tactics of the Trafalgar epoch into practical relation with the stately science
of which in our day this Institution is, as it were, the mother-shrine and metropolitical temple,
I may be allowed to dwell upon it a little longer. The object aimed at by those who favour
great size of individual ships is not, of course, magnitude alone. It is to turn out a ship
which shall be more powerful than an individual antagonist. All recent development of man-of-war
construction has taken the form of producing, or at any rate trying to produce, a more powerful
ship than those of earlier date, or belonging to a rival navy. I know the issues that such
statements are likely to raise; and I ask you, as naval architects, to bear with me patiently
when I say what I am going to say. It is this: If you devise for the ship so produced the tactical
system for which she is specially adapted you must, in order to be logical, base your system
on her power of defeating her particular antagonist. Consequently, you must abandon the principle
of concentration of superior numbers against your enemy; and, what is more, must be prepared
to maintain that such concentration on his part against yourself would be ineffectual. This
will compel a reversion to tactical methods which made a fleet action a series of duels between
pairs of combatants, and--a thing to be pondered on seriously--never enabled anyone to win
a decisive victory on the sea. The position will not be made more logical if you demand both
superior size and also superior numbers, because if you adopt the tactical system appropriate
to one of the things demanded, you will rule out the other. You cannot employ at the same time
two different and opposed tactical systems.

It is not necessary to the line of argument above indicated to ignore the merits of the battleship
class. Like their predecessors, the ships of the line, it is really battleships which in a
naval war dominate the situation. We saw that it was so at the time of Trafalgar, and we see
that it has been so in the war between Russia and Japan, at all events throughout the 1904
campaign. The experience of naval war, down to the close of that in which Trafalgar was the
most impressive event, led to the virtual abandonment of ships of the line[92] above and below
a certain class. The 64-gun ships and smaller two-deckers had greatly diminished in number,
and repetitions of them grew more and more rare. It was the same with the three-deckers, which,
as the late Admiral Colomb pointed out, continued to be built, though in reduced numbers, not
so much for their tactical efficiency as for the convenient manner in which they met the demands
for the accommodation required in flag-ships. The tactical condition which the naval architects
of the Trafalgar period had to meet was the employment of an increased number of two-deckers
of the medium classes.

[Footnote 92: Experience of war, as regards increase in the number of medium-sized men-of-war
of the different classes, tended to the same result in both the French Revolutionary war (1793
to 1801) and the Napoleonic war which began in 1803. Taking both contests down to the end of
the Trafalgar year, the following table will show how great was the development of the line-of-battle-ship
class below the three-decker and above the 64-gun ship. It will also show that there was no
development of, but a relative decline in, the three-deckers and the 64's, the small additions,
where there were any, being generally due to captures from the enemy. The two-deckers not 'fit
to lie in a line' were at the end of the Trafalgar year about half what they were when the
first period of the 'Great War' began. When we come to the frigate classes we find the same
result. In the earlier war 11 frigates of 44 and 40 guns were introduced into our navy. It
is worth notice that this number was not increased, and by the end of the Trafalgar year had,
on the contrary, declined to 10. The smallest frigates, of 28 guns, were 27 in 1793, and 13
at the end of the Trafalgar year. On the other hand, the increase in the medium frigate classes
(38, 36, and 32 guns) was very large. From 1793 to the end of the Trafalgar year the 38-gun
frigates increased from 8 to 50, and the 36-gun frigates from 16 to 54.

The liking for three-deckers, professed by some officers of Nelson's time, seems to have been
due to a belief, not in the merit of their size as such, but in the value of the increased
number of medium guns carried on a 'middle' deck. There is, I believe, nothing to show that
the two-deckers Gibraltar (2185 tons) and Coesar (2003) were considered more formidable than
the three-deckers Balfleur (1947), Glory (1944), or Queen (1876). All these ships were in the
same fleet, and fought in the same battle.]

A fleet of ships of the line as long as it could keep the sea, that is, until it had to retreat
into port before a stronger fleet, controlled a certain area of water. Within that area smaller
men-of-war as well as friendly merchant ships were secure from attack. As the fleet moved about,
so the area moved with it. Skilful disposition and manoeuvring added largely to the extent
of sea within which the maritime interests that the fleet was meant to protect would be safe.
It seems reasonable to expect that it will be the same with modern fleets of suitable battleships.

The tactics of 'single ship actions' at the time of Trafalgar were based upon pure seamanship
backed up by good gunnery. The better a captain handled his ship the more likely he was to
beat his antagonist. Superior speed, where it existed, was used to 'gain the weather gage,'
not in order to get a suitable range for the faster ship's guns, but to compel her enemy to
fight. Superior speed was also used to run away, capacity to do which was not then, and ought
not to be now, reckoned a merit in a ship expressly constructed for fighting, not fleeing.
It is sometimes claimed in these days that superior speed will enable a modern ship to keep
at a distance from her opponent which will be the best range for her own guns. It has not been
explained why a range which best suits her guns should not be equally favourable for the guns
of her opponent; unless, indeed, the latter is assumed to be weakly armed, in which case the
distance at which the faster ship might engage her would be a matter of comparative indifference.
There is nothing in the tactics of the time of Trafalgar to make it appear that--when a fight
had once begun--superior speed, of course within moderate limits, conferred any considerable
tactical advantage in 'single ship actions,' and still less in general or fleet actions. Taking
up a position ahead or astern of a hostile ship so as to be able to rake her was not facilitated
by originally superior speed so much as by the more damaged state of the ship to be raked--raking,
as a rule, occurring rather late in an action.

A remarkable result of long experience of war made itself clearly apparent in the era of Trafalgar.
I have already alluded to the tendency to restrict the construction of line-of-battle ships
to those of the medium classes. The same thing may be noticed in the case of the frigates.[93]
Those of 44, 40, and 28 guns relatively or absolutely diminished in number; whilst the number
of the 38-gun, 36-gun, and 32-gun frigates increased. The officers who had personal experience
of many campaigns were able to impress on the naval architects of the day the necessity of
recognising the sharp distinction that really exists between what we should now call the 'battleship'
and what we should now call the 'cruiser.' In the earlier time there were ships which were
intermediate between the ship of the line and the frigate. These were the two-deckers of 56,
54, 50, 44, and even 40 guns. They had long been regarded as not 'fit to lie in a line,' and
they were never counted in the frigate classes. They seemed to have held a nondescript position,
for no one knew exactly how to employ them in war any more than we now know exactly how to
employ our armoured cruisers, as to which it is not settled whether they are fit for general
actions or should be confined to commerce defending or other cruiser service. The two-deckers
just mentioned were looked upon by the date of Trafalgar as forming an unnecessary class of
fighting ships. Some were employed, chiefly because they existed, on special service; but they
were being replaced by true battleships on one side and true frigates on the other.[94]

[Footnote 93: See footnote 92.]

[Footnote 94: See footnote 92.]

In conclusion, I would venture to say that the strategical and tactical lessons taught by a
long series of naval campaigns had been mastered by our navy by the time of the Trafalgar campaign.
The effect of those lessons showed itself in our ship-building policy, and has been placed
on permanent record in the history of maritime achievement and of the adaptation of material

THE SUPPLY AND COMMUNICATIONS OF A FLEET[95]

[Footnote 95: Written in 1902. (Read at the Hong-Kong United Service Institution.)]

A problem which is not an attractive one, but which has to be solved, is to arrange the proper
method of supplying a fleet and maintaining its communications. In time of peace as well as
in time of war there is a continuous consumption of the articles of various kinds used on board
ship, viz. naval stores, ordnance stores, engineers' stores, victualling stores, coal, water,
&c. If we know the quantity of each description of stores that a ship can carry, and if we
estimate the progressive consumption, we can compute, approximately but accurately enough for
practical purposes, the time at which replenishment would be necessary and to what amount it
should be made up. As a general rule ships stow about three months' stores and provisions.
The amount of coal and engineers' stores, measured in time, depends on the proceedings of the
ship, and can only be calculated if we know during what portion of any given period she will
be under way. Of course, this can be only roughly estimated. In peace time we know nearly exactly
what the expenditure of ammunition within a given length of time--say, a quarter of a year--will
be. For war conditions we can only form an estimate based upon assumptions.

The consumption of provisions depends upon the numbers of officers and men, and in war or peace
would be much the same. The greater activity to be expected in war would lead to more wear
and tear, and consequently to a larger expenditure of naval stores. In peaceful times the quarterly
expenditure of ammunition does not vary materially. In case we were at war, a single action
might cause us to expend in a few hours as much as half a dozen quarterly peace allowances.
There is a certain average number of days that a ship of a particular class is under way in
a year, and the difference between that number and 365 is, of course, the measure of the length
of time she is at anchor or in harbour. Expenditure of coal and of some important articles
of engineers' stores depends on the relation between the time that she is stationary and the
time she is under way. It should be particularly noted that the distinction is not between
time at anchor and time at sea, but between time at anchor and 'time under way.' If a ship
leaves her anchorage to run an engine-trial after refit, or to fire at a target, or to adjust
compasses, or to go into dock--she burns more coal than if she remained stationary. These occasions
of movement may be counted in with the days in which the ship is at sea, and the total taken
as the number of days under way. It may be assumed that altogether these will amount to six
or seven a month. In time of war the period under way would probably be much longer, and the
time spent in expectation of getting under way in a hurry would almost certainly be considerable,
so that expenditure of coal and machinery lubricants would be greatly increased.

The point to be made here is that--independently of strategic conditions, which will be considered
later--the difference in the supply of a given naval force in war and in peace is principally
that in the former the requirements of nearly everything except provisions will be greater;
and consequently that the articles must be forwarded in larger quantities or at shorter intervals
than in peace time. If, therefore, we have arranged a satisfactory system of peace supply,
that system--defence of the line of communications being left out of consideration for the
present--will merely have to be expanded in time of war. In other words, practice in the use
of the system during peace will go a long way towards preparing us for the duty of working
it under war conditions. That a regular system will be absolutely indispensable during hostilities
will not be doubted.

The general principles which I propose to indicate are applicable to any station. We may allow
for a squadron composed of--

   4 battleships,
   4 large cruisers,
   4 second-class cruisers,
  13 smaller vessels of various kinds, and
   3 destroyers,

being away from the principal base-port of the station for several months of the year. The
number of officers and men would be, in round numbers, about 10,000.

In estimating the amounts of stores of different kinds required by men-of-war, it is necessary--in
order to allow for proper means of conveyance--to convert tons of dead-weight into tons by
measurement, as the two are not always exactly equivalent. In the following enumeration only
estimated amounts are stated, and the figures are to be considered as approximate and not precise.
It is likely that in each item an expert maybe able to discover some variation from the rigorously
exact; but the general result will be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes, especially
as experience will suggest corrections.

A thousand men require about 3.1 tons of victualling stores, packages included, daily, We may
make this figure up to 3.5 tons to allow for 'medical comforts' and canteen stores, Consequently
10,000 men require about 35 tons a day, and about 6300 tons for six months. The assumed squadron,
judging from experience, would require in peace time about 600 tons of engineers' stores, about
400 tons of naval stores, and--if the ships started with only their exact allowance on board
and then carried out a full quarterly practice twice--the quantity of ordnance stores and ammunition
required would be about 1140 tons, to meet the ordinary peace rate of expenditure, We thus
get for a full six months' supply the following figures:--

  Victualling stores                 6,300 tons.
  Engineers' stores                    600  "
  Naval stores                         400  "
  Ordnance stores and ammunition     1,140  "
                                     -----
  Total                              8,440  "

Some allowance must be made for the needs of the 'auxiliaries,'[96] the vessels that bring
supplies and in other ways attend on the fighting ships. This may be put at 7 per cent. The
tonnage required would accordingly amount in all to about 9000.

[Footnote 96: The 7 per cent. mentioned in the text would probably cover nearly all the demands--except
coal--of auxiliaries, which would not require much or any ammunition. Coal is provided for
separately.]

The squadron would burn in harbour or when stationary about 110 tons of coal a day, and when
under way about 1050 tons a day. For 140 harbour-days the consumption would be about 15,400
tons; and for 43 days under way about 45,150: so that for coal requirements we should have
the following:--

  Harbour consumption                  15,400 tons.
  Under-way consumption                45,150  "
                                       ------
    Total for fighting ships           60,550  "
    7 per cent. for auxiliaries (say)   4,250  "
                                       ------
                  Grand total          64,800  "

Some time ago (in 1902) a representation was made from the China station that, engine-room
oil being expended whenever coal is expended, there must be some proportion between the quantities
of each. It was, therefore, suggested that every collier should bring to the squadron which
she was supplying a proportionate quantity of oil. This has been approved, and it has been
ordered that the proportions will be 75 gallons of oil to every 100 tons of coal.[97] It was
also suggested that the oil should be carried in casks of two sizes, for the convenience of
both large and small ships.

[Footnote 97: I was informed (on the 10th December 1902), some time after the above was written,
that the colliers supplying the United States Navy are going to carry 100 gallons of oil for
every 100 tons of coal.]

There is another commodity, which ships have never been able to do without, and which they
need now in higher proportion than ever. That commodity is fresh water. The squadron constituted
as assumed would require an average of about 160 tons of fresh water a day, and nearly 30,000
tons in six months. Of this the ships, without adding very inconveniently to their coal consumption,
might themselves distil about one-half; but the remaining 15,000 tons would have to be brought
to them; and another thousand tons would probably be wanted by the auxiliaries, making the
full six months' demand up to 16,000 tons.

The tonnage requirements of the squadron and its 'auxiliaries' for a full six months' period
would be about 74,000, without fresh water. As, however, the ships would have started with
full store-rooms, holds, and bunkers, and might be expected to return to the principal base-port
of the station at the end of the period, stores for four-and-a-half months', and coal to meet
twenty weeks', consumption would be sufficient. These would be about 6750 tons of stores and
ammunition and 46,000 tons of coal.[98]

[Footnote 98: To avoid complicating the question, the water or distilling vessel, the hospital
ship, and the repair vessel have not been considered specially. Their coal and stores have
been allowed for.]

The stores, &c., would have to be replenished twice and--as it would not be prudent to let
the ships run right out of them--replenishment should take place at the end of the second and
at the end of the fourth months. Two vessels carrying stores and ammunition, if capable of
transporting a cargo of nearly 1700 tons apiece, would bring all that was wanted at each replenishment.
To diminish risk of losing all of one description of supplies, if carried by itself in a separate
vessel, it has been considered desirable that each supply-carrier, when employed, is to contain
some ammunition, some stores, and some provisions. There are great advantages in having supply-carriers,
including, of course, colliers, of moderate size. Many officers must have had experience of
the inconvenience and delay due to the employment of a single very large vessel which could
only coal one man-of-war at a time. Several vessels, each carrying a moderate amount of cargo,
would permit much more rapid replenishment of the ships of a squadron. The inconvenience that
would be caused by the loss or breakdown of a supply-carrier would be reduced by employing
several vessels of moderate cargo-capacity instead of only one or two of great capacity.

Each battleship and large cruiser of the assumed squadron may be expected to burn about 1000
tons of coal in five weeks, so that the quantity to be used in that time by all those ships
would be 8000 tons. The remaining ships, scattered between different places as most of them
would probably be, would require about 3500 tons. Therefore, every five weeks or so 11,500
tons of coal would be required. Four replenishments would be necessary in the whole period,
making a total of 46,000 tons. Each replenishment could be conveyed in five colliers with 2300
tons apiece.

Moderate dimensions in store- and coal-carriers would prove convenient, not only because it
would facilitate taking in stores and coaling, if all the squadron were assembled at one place,
but also if part were at one place and part at another. Division into several vessels, instead
of concentration in a few, would give great flexibility to the system of supply. A single very
capacious cargo-carrier might have to go first to one place and supply the ships there, and
then go to supply the remaining ships lying at another anchorage. This would cause loss of
time. The same amount of cargo distributed amongst two or more vessels would permit the ships
at two or more places to be supplied simultaneously.

You may have noticed that I have been dealing with the question as though stores and coal were
to be transported direct to the men-of-war wherever they might be and put straight on board
them from the carrying-vessels. There is, as you all know, another method, which may be described
as that of 'secondary bases.' Speaking generally, each of our naval stations has a principal
base at which considerable or even extensive repairs of the ships can be effected and at which
stores are accumulated. Visits to it for the sake of repair being necessary, the occasion may
be taken advantage of to replenish supplies, so that the maintenance of a stock at the place
makes for convenience, provided that the stock is not too large. The so-called 'secondary base'
is a place at which it is intended to keep in store coal and other articles in the hope that
when war is in progress the supply of our ships may be facilitated. It is a supply, and not
a repairing base.

A comparison of the 'direct' system and 'secondary base' system may be interesting. A navy
being maintained for use in war, it follows, as a matter of course, that the value of any part
of its equipment or organisation depends on its efficiency for war purposes. The question to
be answered is--Which of the two systems promises to help us most during hostilities? This
does not exclude a regard for convenience and economy in time of peace, provided that care
is taken not to push economy too far and not to make ordinary peace-time convenience impede
arrangements essential to the proper conduct of a naval campaign.

It is universally admitted that a secondary base at which stocks of stores are kept should
be properly defended. This necessitates the provision of fortifications and a garrison. Nearly
every article of naval stores of all classes has to be brought to our bases by sea, just as
much as if it were brought direct to our ships. Consequently the communications of the base
have to be defended. They would continue to need defending even if our ships ceased to draw
supplies from it, because the communications of the garrison must be kept open. We know what
happened twice over at Minorca when the latter was not done.

The object of accumulating stores at a secondary base is to facilitate the supply of fighting
ships, it being rather confidently assumed that the ships can go to it to replenish without
being obliged to absent themselves for long from the positions in which they could best counteract
the efforts of the enemy. When war is going on it is not within the power of either side to
arrange its movements exactly as it pleases. Movements must, at all events very often, conform
to those of the enemy. It is not a bad rule when going to war to give your enemy credit for
a certain amount of good sense. Our enemy's good sense is likely to lead him to do exactly
what we wish him not to do, and not to do that which we wish him to do. We should, of course,
like him to operate so that our ships will not be employed at an inconvenient distance from
our base of supplies. If we have created permanent bases in time of peace the enemy will know
their whereabouts as well as we do ourselves, and, unless he is a greater fool than it is safe
to think he is, he will try to make us derive as little benefit from them as possible. He is
likely to extend his operations to localities at a distance from the places to which, if we
have the secondary base system of supply, he knows for certain that our ships must resort.
We shall have to do one of two things--either let him carry on his operations undisturbed,
or conform to his movements. To this is due the common, if not invariable, experience of naval
warfare, that the fleet which assumes the offensive has to establish what are sometimes called
'flying bases,' to which it can resort at will. This explains why Nelson rarely used Gibraltar
as a base; why we occupied Balaclava in 1854; and why the Americans used Guantanamo Bay in
1898. The flying base is not fortified or garrisoned in advance. It is merely a convenient
anchorage, in a good position as regards the circumstances of the war; and it can be abandoned
for another, and resumed, if desirable, as the conditions of the moment dictate.

It is often argued that maintenance of stocks of stores at a secondary base gives a fleet a
free hand and at least relieves it from the obligation of defending the line of communications.
We ought to examine both contentions. It is not easy to discover where the freedom comes in
if you must always proceed to a certain place for supplies, whether convenient or not. It may
be, and very likely will be, of the utmost importance in war for a ship to remain on a particular
station. If her coal is running short and can only be replenished by going to a base, go to
the base she must, however unfortunate the consequences. It has been mentioned already that
nearly every item on our store list has to be brought to a base by sea. Let us ascertain to
what extent the accumulation of a stock at a place removes the necessity of defending the communication
line. Coal is so much the greater item that consideration of it will cover that of all the rest.

The squadron, as assumed, requires about 11,500 tons of coal every five weeks in peace time.
Some is commonly obtained from contractors at foreign ports; but to avoid complicating the
subject we may leave contract issues out of consideration. If you keep a stock of 10,000 tons
at your permanent secondary base, you will have enough to last your ships about four-and-a-half
weeks. Consequently you must have a stream of colliers running to the place so as to arrive
at intervals of not more than about thirty days. Calculations founded on the experience of
manoeuvres show that in war time ships would require nearly three times the quantity used in
peace. It follows that, if you trebled your stock of coal at the base and made it 30,000 tons,
you would in war still require colliers carrying that amount to arrive about every four weeks.
Picture the line of communications with the necessary colliers on it, and see to what extent
you are released from the necessity of defending it. The bulk of other stores being much less
than that of coal, you could, no doubt, maintain a sufficient stock of them to last through
the probable duration of the war; but, as you must keep your communications open to ensure
the arrival of your coal, it would be as easy for the other stores to reach you as it would
be for the coal itself. Why oblige yourself to use articles kept long in store when much fresher
ones could be obtained? Therefore the maintenance of store depots at a secondary base no more
releases you from the necessity of guarding your communications than it permits freedom of
movement to your ships.

The secondary base in time of war is conditioned as follows. If the enemy's sphere of activity
is distant from the base which you have equipped with store-houses and fortifications, the
place cannot be of any use to you. It can, and probably will, be a cause of additional anxiety
to you, because the communications of its garrison must still be kept open. If it is used,
freedom of movement for the ships must be given up, because they cannot go so far from it as
to be obliged to consume a considerable fraction of their coal in reaching it and returning
to their station. The line along which your colliers proceed to it must be effectively guarded.

Contrast this with the system of direct supply to the ships-of-war. You choose for your flying
base a position which will be as near to the enemy's sphere of action as you choose to make
it. You can change its position in accordance with circumstances. If you cease to use the position
first chosen you need trouble yourself no more about its special communications. You leave
nothing at it which will make it worth the enemy's while to try a dash at it. The power of
changing the flying base from one place to another gives almost perfect freedom of movement
to the fighting ships. Moreover, the defence of the line communicating with the position selected
is not more difficult than that of the line to a fixed base.

The defence of a line of communication ought to be arranged on the same plan as that adopted
for the defence of a trade route, viz. making unceasing efforts to attack the intending assailant.
Within the last few years a good deal has been written about the employment of cruisers. The
favourite idea seems to be that peace-time preparation for the cruiser operations of war ought
to take the form of scouting and attendance on fleets. The history of naval warfare does not
corroborate this view. We need not forget Nelson's complaint of paucity of frigates: but had
the number attached to his fleet been doubled, the general disposition of vessels of the class
then in commission would have been virtually unaltered. At the beginning of 1805, the year
of Trafalgar, we had--besides other classes--232 frigates and sloops in commission; at the
beginning of 1806 we had 264. It is doubtful if forty of these were attached to fleets.

It is sometimes contended that supply-carriers ought to be vessels of great speed, apparently
in order that they may always keep up with the fighting ships when at sea. This, perhaps, is
due to a mistaken application of the conditions of a land force on the march to those of a
fleet or squadron making a voyage. In practice a land army cannot separate itself--except for
a very short time--from its supplies. Its movements depend on those of its supply-train. The
corresponding 'supply-train' of a fleet or squadron is in the holds and bunkers of its ships.
As long as these are fairly well furnished, the ships might be hampered, and could not be assisted,
by the presence of the carriers. Why do we not work the direct system of supply whilst we are
at peace so as to familiarise ourselves with the operations it entails before the stress of
serious emergency is upon us? There are two reasons. One is, because we have used the permanent
base method so long that, as usually happens in such cases, we find it difficult to form a
conception of any other. The other reason is that the direct supply method is thought to be
too costly. The first reason need not detain us. It is not worthy of even a few minutes' consideration.
The second reason deserves full investigation.

We ought to be always alive to the necessity of economy. The only limit to economy of money
in any plan of naval organisation is that we should not carry it so far that it will be likely
to impair efficiency. Those who are familiar with the correspondence of the great sea-officers
of former days will have noticed how careful they were to prevent anything like extravagant
expenditure. This inclination towards a proper parsimony of naval funds became traditional
in our service. The tradition has, perhaps, been rather weakened in these days of abundant
wealth; but we should do our best not to let it die out. Extravagance is a serious foe to efficient
organisation, because where it prevails there is a temptation to try imperfectly thought-out
experiments, in the belief that, if they fail, there will still be plenty of money to permit
others to be tried. This, of course, encourages slovenly want of system, which is destructive
of good organisation.

We may assume, for the purposes of our investigation, that our permanently equipped secondary
base contains a stock of 10,000 tons of coal. Any proportionate quantity, however, may be substituted
for this, as the general argument will remain unaffected. As already intimated, coal is so
much greater in bulk and aggregate cost than any other class of stores that, if we arrange
for its supply, the provision of the rest is a comparatively small matter. The squadron which
we have had in view requires an estimated amount of 46,000 tons of coal in six months' period
specified, and a further quantity of 4600 tons may be expected to suffice for the ships employed
in the neighbouring waters during the remainder of the year. This latter amount would have
to be brought in smaller cargoes, say, five of 920 tons each. Allowing for the colliers required
during the six months whilst the whole squadron has to be supplied an average cargo of 2300
tons, we should want twenty arrivals with an aggregate of 46,000 tons, and later on five arrivals
of smaller colliers with an aggregate of 4600 tons to complete the year.

The freight or cost of conveyance to the place need not be considered here, as it would be
the same in either system. If we keep a stock of supplies at a place we must incur expenditure
to provide for the storage of the articles. There would be what may be called the capital charges
for sites, buildings, residences, jetties, tram lines, &c., for which £20,000 would probably
not be enough, but we may put it at that so as to avoid the appearance of exaggeration. A further
charge would be due to the provision of tugs or steam launches, and perhaps lighters. This
would hardly be less than £15,000. Interest on money sunk, cost of repairs, and maintenance,
would not be excessive if they amounted to £3500 a year. There must be some allowance for the
coal used by the tugs and steam launches. It is doubtful if £500 a year would cover this; but
we may put it at that. Salaries and wages of staff, including persons employed in tugs and
steam launches, would reach quite £2500 a year. It is to be noted that the items which these
charges are assumed to cover cannot be dispensed with. If depots are established at all, they
must be so arranged that the stores deposited in them can be securely kept and can be utilised
with proper expedition. The total of the charges just enumerated is £6500 a year.

There are other charges that cannot be escaped. For example, landing a ton of coal at Wei-hai-wei,
putting it into the depot, and taking it off again to the man-of-war requiring it, costs $1
20 cents, or at average official rate of exchange two shillings. At Hong-Kong the cost is about
2s. 5d. a ton. The charge at 2s. per ton on 50,600 tons would be £5060. I am assured by every
engineer officer to whom I have spoken on the subject that the deterioration in coal due to
the four different handlings which it has to undergo if landed in lighters and taken off again
to ships from the coal-store cannot be put at less than 10 per cent. Note that this is over
and above such deterioration as would be due to passing coal direct from the hold of a collier
alongside into a ship's bunkers. If anyone doubts this deterioration it would be well for him
to examine reports on coal and steam trials. He will be unusually fortunate if he finds so
small a deterioration as 10 per cent. The lowest that I can remember having seen reported is
20 per cent.; reports of 30 and even 40 per cent. are quite common. Some of it is for deterioration
due to climate and length of time in store. This, of course, is one of the inevitable conditions
of the secondary base system, the object of which is to keep in stock a quantity of the article
needed. Putting the purchase price of the coal as low as 15s. a ton, a deterioration due to
repeated handling only of 10 per cent. on 50,600 tons would amount to £3795.

There is nearly always some loss of coal due to moving it. I say 'nearly always' because it
seems that there are occasions on which coal being moved increases in bulk. It occurs when
competitive coaling is being carried on in a fleet and ships try to beat records. A collier
in these circumstances gives out more coal than she took in. We shall probably be right if
we regard the increase in this case as what the German philosophers call 'subjective,' that
is, rather existent in the mind than in the external region of objective, palpable fact. It
may be taken as hardly disputable that there will be less loss the shorter the distance and
the fewer the times the coal is moved. Without counting it we see that the annual expenses
enumerated are--

  Establishment charges      £6,500
  Landing and re-shipping     5,060
  Deterioration               3,795
                            -------
                            £15,355

This £15,355 is to be compared with the cost of the direct supply system. The quantity of coal
required would, as said above, have to be carried in twenty colliers--counting each trip as
that of a separate vessel--with, on the average, 2300 tons apiece, and five smaller ones. It
would take fully four days to unload 2300 tons at the secondary base, and even more if the
labour supply was uncertain or the labourers not well practised. Demurrage for a vessel carrying
the cargo mentioned, judging from actual experience, would be about £32 a day; and probably
about £16 a day for the smaller vessels. If we admit an average delay, per collier, of eighteen
days, that is, fourteen days more than the time necessary for removing the cargo into store,
so as to allow for colliers arriving when the ships to be coaled are absent, we should get--

  20 X 14 X 32      £8,960
   5 X 14 X 16       1,120
                   -------
                   £10,080

as the cost of transferring the coal from the holds to the men-of-war's bunkers on the direct
supply system. An average of eighteen days is probably much too long to allow for each collier's
stay till cleared: because, on some occasions, ships requiring coal may be counted on as sure
to be present. Even as it is, the £10,080 is a smaller sum than the £11,560 which the secondary
base system costs over and above the amount due to increased deterioration of coal. If a comparison
were instituted as regards other kinds of stores, the particular figures might be different,
but the general result would be the same.

The first thing that we have got to do is to rid our minds of the belief that because we see
a supply-carrier lying at anchor for some days without being cleared, more money is being spent
than is spent on the maintenance of a shore depot. There may be circumstances in which a secondary
base is a necessity, but they must be rare and exceptional. We saw that the establishment of
one does not help us in the matter of defending our communications. We now see that, so far
from being more economical than the alternative method, the secondary base method is more costly.
It might have been demonstrated that it is really much more costly than the figures given make
it out to be, because ships obliged to go to a base must expend coal in doing so, and coal
costs money. It is not surprising that consideration of the secondary base system should evoke
a recollection of the expression applied by Dryden to the militia of his day:

  In peace a charge; in war a weak defence.

I have to say that I did not prepare this paper simply for the pleasure of reading it, or in
order to bring before you mere sets of figures and estimates of expense. My object has been
to arouse in some of the officers who hear me a determination to devote a portion of their
leisure to the consideration of those great problems which must be solved by us if we are to
wage war successfully. Many proofs reach me of the ability and zeal with which details of material
are investigated by officers in these days. The details referred to are not unimportant in
themselves; but the importance of several of them if put together would be incomparably less
than that of the great question to which I have tried to direct your attention.

The supply of a fleet is of high importance in both peace time and time of war. Even in peace
it sometimes causes an admiral to pass a sleepless night. The arrangements which it necessitates
are often intricate, and success in completing them occasionally seems far off. The work involved
in devising suitable plans is too much like drudgery to be welcome to those who undertake it.
All the same it has to be done: and surely no one will care to deny that the fleet which has
practised in quiet years the system that must be followed in war will start with a great advantage
on its side when it is at last confronted with the stern realities of naval warfare.

POSTSCRIPT

The question of 'Communications,' if fully dealt with in the foregoing paper, would have made
it so long that its hearers might have been tired out before its end was reached. The following
summary of the points that might have been enlarged upon, had time allowed, may interest many
officers:--

In time of war we must keep open our lines of communication.

If we cannot, the war will have gone against us.

Open communications mean that we can prevent the enemy from carrying out decisive and sustained
operations against them and along their line.

To keep communications open it is not necessary to secure every friendly ship traversing the
line against attacks by the enemy. All that is necessary is to restrict the enemy's activity
so far that he can inflict only such a moderate percentage of loss on the friendly vessels
that, as a whole, they will not cease to run.

Keeping communications open will not secure a friendly place against every form of attack.
It will, however, secure a place against attacks with large forces sustained for a considerable
length of time. If he can make attacks of this latter kind, it is clear that the enemy controls
the communications and that we have failed to keep them open.

If communications are open for the passage of vessels of the friendly mercantile marine, it
follows that the relatively much smaller number of supply-vessels can traverse the line.

As regards supply-vessels, a percentage of loss caused by the enemy must be allowed for. If
we put this at 10 per cent.--which, taken absolutely, is probably sufficient--it means that
onthe average out of ten supply-vessels sent we expect nine to reach their destination.

We cannot, however, arrange that an equal loss will fall on every group of ten vessels. Two
such groups may arrive intact, whilst a third may lose three vessels. Yet the 10 per cent.
average would be maintained.

This condition has to be allowed for. Investigations some years ago led to the conclusion that
it would be prudent to send five carriers for every four wanted.

The word 'group' has been used above only in a descriptive sense. Supply-carriers will often
be safer if they proceed to their destination separately. This, however, depends on circumstances.
