Prepare six cored apples by sticking a dozen cloves in each and baking slowly until soft. Put
them in a stone jar and pour over them a toddy made of two quarts of whiskey, one quart of
brandy, one pint of rum and three cups of water, sweeten to taste and cover closely, allowing
the mixture to blend for a week before using.
