 We pressed forward in the rain and raw wind, and reached Fahlun towards evening,
just in time to avoid a drenching storm.

Of the celebrated copper-mines of Fahlun, some of which have been worked for 600 years, we
saw nothing. We took their magnitude and richness for granted, on the strength of the immense
heaps of dross through which we drove on approaching the town, and the desolate appearance
of the surrounding country, whose vegetation has been for the most part destroyed by the fumes
from the smelting works. In our sore and sodden condition, we were in no humour to go sight
seeing, and so sat comfortably by the stove, while the rain beat against the windows, and the
darkness fell. The next morning brought us a renewal of the same weather, but we set out bravely
in our open cart, and jolted over the muddy roads with such perseverance, that we reached Hedemora
at night. The hills diminished in height as we proceeded southward, but the scenery retained
its lovely pastoral character. My most prominent recollection of the day's travel, however,
is of the number of gates our numb and blue-faced boy-postillions were obliged to jump down
and open.

From Hedemora, a journey of two days through the provinces of Westerås and Uppland, brought
us to Upsala. After leaving Dalecarlia and crossing the Dal River for the fifth and last time,
the country gradually sank into those long, slightly rolling plains, which we had traversed
last winter, between Stockholm and Gefle. Here villages were more frequent, but the houses
had not the same air of thrift and comfort as in Dalecarlia. The population also changed in
character, the faces we now saw being less bright, cheerful, and kindly, and the forms less
tall and strongly knit.

We had very fair accommodations, at all the post-stations along the road, and found the people
everywhere honest and obliging. Still, I missed the noble simplicity which I had admired so
much in the natives of Westerdal, and on the frontier of Wermeland,--the unaffected kindness
of heart, which made me look upon every man as a friend.

The large town of Sala, where we spent a night, was filled with fugitives from Upsala, where
the cholera was making great ravages. The violence of the disease was over by the time we arrived;
but the students, all of whom had left, had not yet returned, and the fine old place had a
melancholy air. The first thing we saw on approaching it, was a funeral. Professor Bergfalk,
who had remained at his post, and to whom I had letters, most kindly gave me an entire day
of his time. I saw the famous Codex argenteus, in the library, the original manuscript of Frithiof's
Saga, the journals of Swedenborg and Linnæus, the Botanical Garden, and the tombs of Gustavus
Vasa and John III. in the cathedral. But most interesting of all was our drive to Old Upsala,
where we climbed upon the mound of Odin, and drank mead out of the silver-mounted drinking
horn, from which Bernadotte, Oscar, and the whole royal family of Sweden, are in the habit
of drinking when they make a pilgrimage to the burial place of the Scandinavian gods.

A cold, pale, yellow light lay upon the landscape; the towers of Upsala Cathedral, and the
massive front of the palace, rose dark against the sky, in the south-west; a chill autumnal
wind blew over the plains, and the yellowing foliage of the birch drifted across the mysterious
mounds, like those few golden leaves of poetry, which the modern bards of the North have cast
upon the grave of the grand, muscular religion of the earlier race. There was no melodious
wailing in the wind, like that which proclaimed "Pan is dead!" through the groves of Greece
and Ionia; but a cold rustling hiss, as if the serpent of Midgard were exulting over the ruin
of Walhalla. But in the stinging, aromatic flood of the amber-coloured mead, I drank to Odin,
to Balder, and to Freja.

We reached Stockholm on the 22nd of September, in the midst of a furious gale, accompanied
with heavy squalls of snow--the same in which the Russian line-of-battle ship "Lefort," foundered
in the Gulf of Finland. In the mild, calm, sunny, autumn days which followed, the beautiful
city charmed us more than ever, and I felt half inclined to take back all I had said against
the place, during the dismal weather of last spring. The trees in the Djurgård and in the islands
of Mälar, were still in full foliage; the Dalecarlian boatwomen plied their crafts in the outer
harbour; the little garden under the Norrbro was gay with music and lamps every evening; and
the brief and jovial summer life of the Swedes, so near its close, clung to the flying sunshine,
that not a moment might be suffered to pass by unenjoyed.

In another week we were standing on the deck of the Prussian steamer "Nagler," threading the
rocky archipelago between Stockholm and the open Baltic on our way to Stettin. In leaving the
North, after ten months of winter and summer wanderings, and with scarce a hope of returning
again, I found myself repeating, over and over again, the farewell of Frithiof:--

     "Farväl, J fjällar,
       Der äran bor;
     J runohällar,
       För väldig Thor;
     J blåa sjöar,
       Jag känt så väl;
     J skär och öar,
       Farväl, farväl!"

        With Introduction by Bayard Taylor,                    1.25

"Bayard Taylor is certainly a remarkable man. The more we see of him in his writings, and the
more we hear of him, the more we admire him. He is decidedly the American traveller, and travel
writer."--New Haven Courier.

"As a writer of travels especially, he has never found his equal." --Buffalo Democracy.

"As a vivid delineator, it would be difficult to overmatch Mr. Taylor." --Liverpool Standard.

"There is no romance to us quite equal to one of Bayard Taylor's books of travel. Fact, under
his wonderful pen, is more charming than Fiction." --Hartford Republican.
