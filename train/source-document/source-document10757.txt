EDITOR'S PREFACE

The Modern Educator's Library has been designed to give considered expositions of the best
theory and practice in English education of to-day. It is planned to cover the principal problems
of educational theory in general, of curriculum and organisation, of some unexhausted aspects
of the history of education, and of special branches of applied education.

The Editor and his colleagues have had in view the needs of young teachers and of those training
to be teachers, but since the school and the schoolmaster are not the sole factors in the educative
process, it is hoped that educators in general (and which of us is not in some sense or other
an educator?) as well as the professional schoolmaster may find in the series some help in
understanding precept and practice in education of to-day and to-morrow. For we have borne
in mind not only what is but what ought to be. To exhibit the educator's work as a vocation
requiring the best possible preparation is the spirit in which these volumes have been written.

No artificial uniformity has been sought or imposed, and while the Editor is responsible for
the series in general, the responsibility for the opinions expressed in each volume rests solely
with its author.

AUTHORS' PREFACE

We have made this book between us, but we have not collaborated. We know that we agree in all
essentials, though our experience has differed. We both desire to see the best conditions for
development provided for all children, irrespective of class. We both look forward to the time
when the conditions of the Public Elementary School, from the Nursery School up, will be such--in
point of numbers, in freedom from pressure, in situation of building, in space both within
and without, and in beauty of surroundings--that parents of any class will gladly let their
children attend it.

We are teachers and we have dealt mainly with the mental or, as we prefer to call it, the spiritual
requirements of children. It is from the medical profession that we must all accept facts about
food values, hours of sleep, etc., and the importance of cleanliness and fresh air are now
fully recognised. We do, however, feel that there is room for fresh discussion of ultimate
aims and of daily procedure. Mr. Clutton Brock has said that the great weakness of English
education is the want of a definite aim to put before our children, the want of a philosophy
for ourselves. Without some understanding of life and its purpose or meaning, the teacher is
at the mercy of every fad and is apt to exalt method above principle. This book is an attempt
to gather together certain recognised principles, and to show in the light of actual experience
how these may be applied to existing circumstances.

The day is coming when all teachers will seek to understand the true value of Play, of spontaneous
activity in all directions. Its importance is emphasised in nearly all the educational writings
of the day, as well in the Senior as in the Junior departments of the school, but we need a
full and deep understanding of the saying, "Man is Man only when he plays." It is easy to say
we believe it, but it needs strong faith, courage, and wide intelligence to weave such belief
into the warp of daily life in school.

THE CHILD IN THE NURSERY AND KINDERGARTEN

CHAPTER I

"WHAT'S IN A NAME?"

It is an appropriate time to produce a book on English schools for little children, now that
Nursery Schools have been specially selected for notice and encouragement by an enlightened
Minister for Education. It was Madame Michaelis, who in 1890 originally and most appropriately
used the term Nursery School as the English equivalent of a title suggested by Froebel[1] for
his new institution, before he invented the word Kindergarten, a title which, literally translated,
ran "Institution for the Care of Little Children."

[Footnote 1: Froebel's Letters, trans. Michaelis and Moore, p. 30.]

In England the word Nursery, which implies the idea of nurture, belongs properly to children,
though it has been borrowed by the gardener for his young plants. In Germany it was the other
way round; Froebel had to invent the term child garden to express his idea of the nurture,
as opposed to the repression, of the essential nature of the child. Unfortunately the word
Kindergarten while being naturalised in England had two distinct meanings attached to it. Well-to-do
people began to send their children to a new institution, a child garden or play school. The
children of the people, however, already attended Infant Schools, of which the chief feature
was what Mr. Caldwell Cook calls "sit-stillery," and here the word Kindergarten, really equivalent
to Nursery School, became identified with certain occupations, childlike in origin it is true,
but formalised out of all recognition. How a real Kindergarten strikes a child is illustrated
by the recent remark from a little new boy who had been with us for perhaps three mornings.
"Shall I go up to the nursery now?" he asked.

The first attempt at a Kindergarten was made in 1837, and by 1848 Germany possessed sixteen.
In that eventful year came the revolution in Berlin, which created such high hopes, doomed,
alas! to disappointment. It must have been an easy matter to bring charges of revolutionary
doctrines against the man who said so innocently, "But I,--I only wanted to train up free-thinking,
independent men."

[Footnote 2: Author of An Egyptian Princess, etc.]

It was from "stony Berlin," as Froebel calls it, that the edict went forth in the name of the
Minister of Education entirely prohibiting Kindergartens in Prussia, and the prohibition soon
spread. At the present time it seems to us quite fitting that the bitter attack upon Kindergartens
should have been launched by Folsung, a schoolmaster, "who began life as an artilleryman."
Nor is it less interesting to read that it was under the protection of Von Moltke himself that
Oberlin schools were opened to counteract the attractions of the "godless" Kindergarten.

Little wonder that the same man who in 1813 had so gladly taken up arms to resist the invasion
of Napoleon, and who had rejoiced with such enthusiasm in the prospect of a free and united
Fatherland, should write in 1851:

"Wherefore I have made a firm resolve that if the conditions of German life will not allow
room for the development of honest efforts for the good of humanity; if this indifference to
all higher things continues--then it is my purpose next spring to seek in the land of union
and independence a soil where my idea of education may strike deep root."

And to America he might have gone had he lived, but he died three months later, his end hastened
by grief at the edict which closed the Kindergartens. There had been some confusion between
Froebel and one of his nephews, who had democratic leanings, and no doubt anything at all democratic
did mean atheism to "stony Berlin" and its intolerant autocracy.

For a time, at least in Bavaria, a curious compromise was allowed. If the teacher were a member
of the Orthodox Church, she might have her Kindergarten, but if she belonged to one of the
Free Churches, it was permissible to open an Infant School, but she must not use the term Kindergarten.

Froebel was by no means of the opinion that, if only the teacher had the right spirit, the
name did not matter. Rather did he hold with Confucius, whose answer to the question of a disciple,
"How shall I convert the world?" was, "Call things by their right names." He refused to use
the word school, because "little children, especially those under six, do not need to be schooled
and taught, what they need is opportunity for development." He had great difficulty in selecting
a name. Those originally suggested were somewhat cumbrous, e.g. Institution for the Promotion
of Spontaneous Activity in Children; another was Self-Teaching Institution, and there was also
the one which Madame Michaelis translated "Nursery School for Little Children."

But the name Kindergarten expressed just what he Wanted: "As in a garden, under God's favour,
and by the care of a skilled intelligent gardener, growing plants are cultivated in accordance
with Nature's laws, so here in our child garden shall the noblest of all growing things, men
(that is, children), be cultivated in accordance with the laws of their own being, of God and
of Nature."

To one of his students he writes: "You remember well enough how hard we worked and how we had
to fight that we might elevate the Darmstadt crèche, or rather Infant School, by improved methods
and organisation until it became a true Kindergarten.... Now what was the outcome of all this,
even during my own stay at Darmstadt? Why, the fetters which always cripple a crèche or an
Infant School, and which seem to cling round its very name--these fetters were allowed to remain
unbroken. Every one was pleased with so faithful a mistress as yourself,... yet they withheld
from you the main condition of unimpeded development, that of the freedom necessary to every
young healthy and vigorous plant.... Is there really such importance underlying the mere name
of a system?--some one might ask. Yes, there is.... It is true that any one watching your teaching
would observe a new spirit infused into it, expressing and fulfilling the child's own wants
and desires. You would strike him as personally capable, but you would fail to strike him as
priestess of the idea which God has now called to life within man's bosom, and of the struggle
towards the realisation of that idea--education by development--the destined means of raising
the whole human race.... No man can acquire fresh knowledge, even at a school, beyond the measure
which his own stage of development fits him to receive.... Infant Schools are nothing but a
contradiction of child-nature. Little children especially those under school age, ought not
to be schooled and taught, what they need is opportunity for development. This idea lies in
the very name of a Kindergarten.... And the name is absolutely necessary to describe the first
education of children."

For an actual definition of what Froebel meant by his Nursery School for Little Children or
Kindergarten, it is only fair to go to the founder himself. He has left us two definitions
or descriptions, one announced shortly before the first Kindergarten was opened, which runs:

"An institution for the fostering of human life, through the cultivation of the human instincts
of activity, of investigation and of construction in the child, as a member of the family,
of the nation and of humanity; an institution for the self-instruction, self-education and
self-cultivation of mankind, as well as for all-sided development of the individual through
play, through creative self-activity and spontaneous self-instruction."

A second definition is given in Froebel's reply to a proposal that he should establish "my
system of education--education by development"--in London, Paris or the United States:

"We also need establishments for training quite young children in their first stage of educational
development, where their training and instruction shall be based upon their own free action
or spontaneity acting under proper rules, these rules not being arbitrarily decreed, but such
as must arise by logical necessity from the child's mental and bodily nature, regarding him
as a member of the great human family; such rules as are, in fact, discovered by the actual
observation of children when associated together in companies. These establishments bear the
name of Kindergartens."

Unfortunately there are but few pictures of Froebel's own Kindergarten, but there seems to
have been little formality in its earliest development. An oft-told story is that of Madame
von Marenholz in 1847 going to watch the proceedings of "an old fool," as the villagers called
him, who played games with the village children. A less well-known account is given by Col.
von Arnswald, again a Keilhau boy, who visited Blankenberg in 1839, when Froebel had just opened
his first Kindergarten.

"Arriving at the place, I found my Middendorf[3] seated by the pump in the market-place, surrounded
by a crowd of little children. Going near them I saw that he was engaged in mending the jacket
of a boy. By his side sat a little girl busy with thread and needle upon another piece of clothing;
one boy had his feet in a bucket of water washing them carefully; other girls and boys were
standing round attentively looking upon the strange pictures of real life before them, and
waiting for something to turn up to interest them personally. Our meeting was of the most cordial
kind, but Middendorf did not interrupt the business in which he was engaged. 'Come, children,'
he cried, 'let us go into the garden!' and with loud cries of joy the little folk with willing
feet followed the splendid-looking, tall man, running all round him.

[Footnote 3: One of Froebel's most devoted helpers.]

"The garden was not a garden, however, but a barn, with a small room and an entrance hall.
In the entrance Middendorf welcomed the children and played a round game with them, ending
with the flight of the little ones into the room, where each of them sat down in his place
on the bench and took his box of building blocks. For half an hour they were all busy with
their blocks, and then came 'Come, children, let us play "spring and spring."' And when the
game was finished they went away full of joy and life, every one giving his little hand for
a grateful good-bye."

Here in this earliest of Free Kindergartens are certain essentials. Washing and mending, the
alternation of constructive play with active exercise, rhythmic game and song, and last but
not least human kindliness and courtesy. The shelter was but a barn, but there are things more
important than premises.

Froebel died too soon to see his ideals realised, but he had sown the seed in the heart of
at least one woman with brain to grasp and will to execute. As early as 1873 the Froebelians
had established something more than the equivalent of the Montessori Children's Houses under
the name of Free Kindergartens or People's Kindergartens. It will bring this out more clearly
if, without referring here to any modern experiments in America, in England and Scotland, or
in the Dominions, we quote the description of an actual People's Kindergarten or Nursery School
as it was established nearly fifty years ago.

The moving spirit of this institution was Henrietta Schroder, Froebel's own grand-niece, trained
by him, and of whom he said that she, more than any other, had most truly understood his views.

The whole institution was called the Pestalozzi-Froebel House. The Prussian edict, which abolished
the Kindergarten almost before it had started, was now rescinded, and our own Princess Royal[4]
gave warm support to this new institution. The description here quoted was actually written
in 1887, when the institution had been in existence for fourteen years:

[Footnote 4: The Crown Princess of Prussia, afterwards the Empress Frederick.]

"The purpose of the National Kindergarten is to provide the necessary and natural help which
poor mothers require, who have to leave their children to themselves.

"The establishment contains:--

"(1) The Kindergarten proper, a National Kindergarten with four classes for children from 2-1/2
to 6 years old.

"(2) The Transition Class, only held in the morning for children about 6 or 6-1/2 years old.

"(3) The Preparatory School, for children from 6 to 7 or 7-1/2 years old.

"(4) The School of Handwork, for children from 6 to 10 or older.

"Dinners are provided for those children whose parents work all day away from home at a trifling
charge of a halfpenny and a penny. Also, for a trifle, poor children may receive assistance
of various kinds in illness, or may have milk or baths through the kindness of the kindred
'Association for the Promotion of Health in the Household.'

"In the institution we are describing there is a complete and well-furnished kitchen, a bathroom,
a courtyard with sand for digging, with pebbles and pine-cones, moss, shells and straw, etc.,
a garden, and a series of rooms and halls suitably furnished and arranged for games, occupations,
handwork and instruction. Madame Schrader is steadfastly opposed to that conception of the
Kindergarten which insists upon mathematically shaped materials for the Froebelian occupations.
Her own words are: 'The children find in our institution every encouragement to develop their
capabilities and powers by use; not by their selfish use to their own personal advantage, but
by their use in the loving service of others. The longing to help people and to accomplish
little pieces of work proportioned to their feeble powers is constant in children; and lies
alongside of their need for that free and unrestrained play which is the business of their life."

[Footnote 5: From certain old photographs, I suppose this to have been what we now call a Kindergarten
Band.]

"The elder children are expected to employ themselves in cleaning, taking care of, arranging,
keeping in order, and using the many various things belonging to the housekeeping department
of the Kindergarten; for example, they set out and clear away the materials required for the
games and handicrafts; they help in cleaning the rooms, furniture and utensils; they keep all
things in order and cleanliness; they paste together torn wallpapers or pictures, they cover
books, and they help in the cooking and in preparations for it; in laying the tables, in washing
up the plates and dishes, etc. The children gain in this manner the simple but most important
foundations of their later duties as housekeepers and householders, and at the same time learn
to regard these duties as things done in the service of others."

It is worth while to notice the order in which the necessities of this place are described.
First comes a kitchen and next a bathroom, then an out-of-doors playground with abundant material
for gaining ideas through action--sand, pebbles, pine-cones, moss, shells and straw. Then comes
the garden, and only after all these, the rooms and halls for indoors games, handwork and instruction.
It is worth while also to note the prominence given to play, music, poetry and story-telling
pictures, domestic occupations and gardening, all preceding the "systematic and ordered occupations"
which to some have seemed so all-important.

If we compare this with the current ideas about Nursery Schools, we do not find that it falls
much below the present ideal. There has been a time when some of us feared that only the bodily
needs of the little child were to be considered, but the "Regulations for Nursery Schools"
have banished such fear. In these the child is regarded as a human being, with spiritual as
well as bodily requirements.

To put it shortly, the physical requirements of a child are food, fresh air and exercise, cleanliness
and rest. It is not so easy to sum up the requirements of a human soul. The first is sympathy,
and though this may spring from parental instinct, it should be nourished by true understanding.
Next perhaps comes the need for material, material for investigation, for admiration, for imitation
and for construction or creation. Power of sense-discrimination is important enough, but in
this case if we take care of the pounds of admiration and investigation, the pence of sense-discrimination
will take care of themselves.

Besides these the child has the essentially human need for social intercourse, for speech,
for games, for songs and stories, for pictures and poetry. He must have opportunity both to
imitate and to share in the work and life around him; he must be an individual among other
individuals, a necessary part of a whole, allowed to give as well as to receive service. In
the National Kindergarten of 1873 no one of these requirements is overlooked except the provision
for sleep, and from old photographs we know that this, too, was considered.

Nursery Schools are needed for children of all classes. It is not only the children of the
poor who require sympathy and guidance from those specially qualified by real grasp of the
facts of child-development. Well-to-do mothers, too, often leave their children to ignorant
and untrained servants, or to the equally untrained and hardly less ignorant nursery governess.

Mothers in small houses have much to do; making beds and washing dishes, sweeping and dusting,
baking and cooking, making and mending, not to mention tending an infant or tending the sick,
leave little leisure for sympathy with the adventuring and investigating propensities natural
and desirable in a healthy child between three and five. There are innumerable Kindergartens
open only in the morning for the children of those who can afford to pay, and these could well
be multiplied and assisted just as far as is necessary. In towns, at least, mothers with but
small incomes would gladly pay a moderate fee to have their little ones, especially their sturdy
little boys, guarded from danger and trained to good habits, yet allowed freedom for happy
activity.

Kindergartens and Nursery Schools ought to be as much as possible fresh-air schools. They should
never be large or the home atmosphere must disappear. They should always have grassy spaces
and common flowers, and they ought to be within easy reach of the children's homes.

There must for the present be certain differences between the Free Kindergarten or Nursery
School for the poor and for those whose parents are fairly well-to-do. In both cases we must
supply what the children need. If the mother must go out to work, the child requires a home
for the day, and the Nursery School must make arrangements for feeding the children. All little
children are the better for rest and if possible for sleep during the day; but for those who
live in overcrowded rooms, where quiet and restful sleep in good air is impossible, the need
for daily sleep is very great. All Free Kindergartens arrange for this.

Most important also is the training to cleanliness. This is not invariably the lot even of
those who come from apparently comfortable homes to attend fee-paying Kindergartens, and among
the poor, differences in respect of cleanliness are very great. But soap and hot water do cost
money and washing takes time, and the modern habit of brushing teeth has not yet been acquired
by all classes of the community. The Free Kindergartens provide for necessary washing, each
child is provided with its own tooth-brush; and tooth-brush drill is a daily practice, somewhat
amusing to witness. The best baby rooms in our Infant Schools carry out the same practices,
and these are likely to be turned into Nursery Schools.

It cannot yet be accepted as conclusively proved that a completely open-air life is the best
in our climate. We have not yet sufficient statistics. No doubt children do improve enormously
in open-air camps, but so they do in ordinary Nursery Schools, where they are clean, happy
and well fed, and where they live a regular life with daily sleep. Housing conditions complicate
the problem, and all children must suffer who sleep in crowded, noisy, unventilated rooms.

Up to the present time Nursery Schools have been provided by voluntary effort entirely, and
far too little encouragement has been given to those enlightened headmistresses of Infant Schools
who have tried to give to their lowest classes Nursery School conditions. Since the passing
of Mr. Fisher's Education Bill, however, we are entitled to hope that soon, for all children
in the land, there may be the opportunity of a fair start under the care of "a person with
breadth of outlook and imagination," the equivalent of Froebel's "skilled intelligent gardener."

In the following chapter an attempt is made to explain how it is that so many years ago Froebel
reached his vision of what a child is, and of what a child needs, and the considerations on
which he based his "Nursery School for Little Children" or "Self-Teaching Institution."

"A large bright room, ... a sandheap in one corner, a low tub or bath of water in another,
a rope ladder, a swing, steps to run up and down and such like, a line of black or green board
low down round the wall, little rough carts and trolleys, boxes which can be turned into houses,
or shops, or pretence ships, etc., a cooking stove of a very simple nature, dolls of all kinds,
wooden animals, growing plants in boxes, an aquarium."

Any Froebelian would recognise this as the description of a more or less ideal Kindergarten
or Nursery School, and yet the writer had probably never read a page that Froebel wrote. On
the contrary, she shows her entire ignorance of the real Kindergarten by calling it "pretty
employments devised by adults and imposed at set times by authority."

The description is taken from a very able address on "Child Nature and Education" delivered
some years ago by Miss Hoskyns Abrahall. It is quoted here, because, for her conception of
right surroundings for young children, the speaker has gone to the very source from which Froebel
took his ideas--she has gone to what Froebel indeed called "the only true source, life itself,"
and she writes from the point of view of the biologist.

There exists at present, in certain quarters, a belief that the Kindergarten is old-fashioned,
out of date, more especially that it has no scientific basis. It is partly on this account
that the ideas of Dr. Maria Montessori, who has approached the question of the education of
young children from the point of view of medical science, have been warmly welcomed by so large
a circle. But neither in England nor in America does that circle include the Froebelians, and
this for several reasons. For one thing, much that the general public has accepted as new--and
in this general public must be included weighty names, men of science, educational authorities,
and others who have never troubled to inquire into the meaning of the Kindergarten--are already
matters of everyday life to the Froebelian. Among these comes the idea of training to service
for the community, and the provision of suitable furniture, little chairs and tables, which
the children can move about, and low cupboards for materials, all of which tend to independence
and self-control.

It is a more serious stumbling-block to the Froebelian that Dr. Montessori, while advocating
freedom in words, has really set strict limits to the natural activities of children by laying
so much stress on her "didactic apparatus," the intention of which is formal training in sense-discrimination.
This material, which is an adaptation and enlargement of that provided by Séguin for his mentally
deficient children, is certainly open to the reproach of having been "devised by adults." It
is formal, and the child is not permitted to use it for his own purposes.

Before everything else, however, comes the fact that in no place has Dr. Montessori shown that
she has made any study of play, or that she attaches special importance to the play activities,
or natural activities of childhood, on which the Kindergarten is founded. This is probably
accounted for in that her first observations were made on deficient children who are notably
wanting in initiative.

Among these "play activities" we should include the child's perpetual imitation or pretence,
a matter which Dr. Montessori entirely fails to understand, as shown in her more recent book,
where she treats of imagination. Here she maintains that only the children of the comparatively
poor ride upon their fathers' walking-sticks or construct coaches of chairs, that this "is
not a proof of imagination but of an unsatisfied desire," and that rich children who own ponies
and who drive out in motor-cars "would be astonished to see the delight of children who imagine
themselves to be drawn along by stationary armchairs." Imitative play has, of course, nothing
to do with poverty or riches, but is, as Froebel said long since, the outcome of an initiative
impulse, sadly wanting in deficient children, an impulse which prompts the child of all lands,
of all time and of all classes to imitate or dramatise, and so to gain some understanding of
everything and of every person he sees around.

The work of Dr. Montessori has helped enormously in the movement, begun long since, for greater
freedom in our Infant Schools; freedom, not from judicious guidance and authority, but from
rigid time-tables and formal lessons, and from arbitrary restrictions, as well as freedom for
the individual as apart from the class. The best Kindergartens and Infant Schools had already
discarded time-tables, and Kindergarten classes have always been small enough to give the individual
a fair chance. Froebel himself constantly urged that the child should become familiar with
"both the strongly opposed elements of his life, the individual determining and directing side,
and the general ordered and subordinated side." He urged the early development of the social
consciousness as well as insisting on expansion of individuality, but it is always difficult
to combine the two, and most Kindergarten teachers will benefit by learning from Dr. Montessori
to apply the method of individual learning to a greater extent.

We are, however, fully prepared to maintain that Froebel; even in 1840, had a wider and a deeper
realisation of the needs of the child than has as yet been attained by the Dottoressa.[6] In
order to make this clear, it is proposed to compare the theories of Froebel with the conclusions
of a biologist. For biology has a wider and a saner outlook than medical science; it does not
start from the abnormal, but with life under normal conditions.

[Footnote 6: Her latest publication regarding the instruction--for it is not education--of
older children makes this even more plain. For here is no discussion of what children at this
stage require, but a mere plunge into "subjects" in which formal grammar takes a foremost place.]

In the address, from which the opening words of this chapter are quoted, it is suggested that
a capable biologist be set to deal with education, but he is to be freed "from all preconceived
ideas derived from accepted tradition." After such fundamentals as food and warmth, light,
air and sleep, the first problems considered by this Biologist Educator are stages of growth,
their appropriate activities, and the stimuli necessary to evoke them. Always he bears in mind
that "interference with a growing creature is a hazardous business," and takes as his motto
"When in doubt, refrain."

To discover the natural activities of the child, the biologist relies upon, first, observation
of the child himself, secondly, upon his knowledge of the nervous system, and thirdly, upon
his knowledge of the past history of the race. From these he comes to a very pertinent conclusion,
viz. It was because Froebel was himself, even in 1826, the Biologist Educator desiring to break
with preconceived ideas and traditions that he wished one of his pupils had been able to "call
your work by its proper name, and so make evident the real nature of the new spirit you have
introduced."[8]

[Footnote 8: See p. 4.]

But Froebel was more than a biologist, he was a philosopher and an idealist. Such words have
sometimes been used as terms of reproach, but wisdom can only be justified of her children.

At the back of all Froebel has to say about "The Education of the Human Being" lies his conception
of what the human being is. And it is impossible fully to understand why Froebel laid so much
stress on spontaneous play unless we go deeper than the province of the biologist without in
the least minimising the importance of biological knowledge to educational theory. As the biologist
defines play as "the natural manifestation of the child's activities," so Froedel says "play
at first is just natural life." But to him the true inwardness of spontaneous play lies in
the fact that it is spontaneous--so far as anything in the universe can be spontaneous. For
spontaneous response to environment is self-expression, and out of self-expression comes selfhood,
consciousness of self. If we are to understand Froebel at all, we must begin with the answer
he found, or accepted, from Krause and others for his first question, What is that self?

Before reaching the question of how to educate, it seemed to him necessary to consider not
only the purpose or aim of education, but the purpose or aim of human existence, the purpose
of all and any existence, even whether there is any purpose in anything; and that brings us
to what he calls "the groundwork of all," of which a summary is given in the following paragraphs.

In the universe we can perceive plan, purpose or law, and behind this there must be some great
Mind, "a living, all-pervading, energising, self-conscious and hence eternal Unity" whom we
call God. Nature and all existing things are a revelation of God.

As Bergson speaks of the élan vital which expresses itself from infinity to infinity, so Froebel
says that behind everything there is force, and that we cannot conceive of force without matter
on which it can exercise itself. Neither can we think of matter without any force to work upon
it, so that "force and matter mutually condition one another," we cannot think one without
the other.

This force expresses itself in all ways, the whole universe is the expression of the Divine,
but "man is the highest and most perfect earthly being in whom the primordial force is spiritualised
so that man feels, understands and knows his own power." Conscious development of one's own
power is the triumph of spirit over matter, therefore human development is spiritual development.
So while man is the most perfect earthly being, yet, with regard to spiritual development he
has returned to a first stage and "must raise himself through ascending degrees of consciousness"
to heights as yet unknown, "for who has measured the limits of God-born mankind?"

Self-consciousness is the special characteristic of man. No other animal has the power to become
conscious of himself because man alone has the chance of failure. The lower animals have definite
instincts and cannot fail, i.e. cannot learn.[9] Man wants to do much, but his instincts are
less definite and most actions have to be learned; it is by striving and failing that he learns
to know not only his limitations but the power that is within him--his self.

[Footnote 9: This would nowadays be considered too sweeping an assertion.]

According to Froebel, "the aim of education is the steady progressive development of mankind,
there is and can be no other"; and, except as regards physiological knowledge inaccessible
in his day, he is at one with the biologist as to how we are to find out the course of this
development. First, by looking into our own past; secondly, by the observation of children
as individuals as well as when associated together, and by comparison of the results of observation;
thirdly, by comparison of these with race history and race development.

Froebel makes much of observation of children. He writes to a cousin begging her to "record
in writing the most important facts about each separate child," and adds that it seems to him
"most necessary for the comprehension of child-nature that such observations should be made
public,... of the greatest importance that we should interchange the observations we make so
that little by little we may come to know the grounds and conditions of what we observe, that
we may formulate their laws." He protests that even in his day "the observation, development
and guidance of children in the first years of life up to the proper age of school" is not
up to the existing level of "the stage of human knowledge or the advance of science and art";
and he states that it is "an essential part" of his undertaking "to call into life an institution
for the preparation of teachers trained for the care of children through observation of their
life."

In speaking of the stages of development of the individual, Froebel says that "there is no
order of importance in the stages of human development except the order of succession, in which
the earlier is always the more important," and from that point of view we ought "to consider
childhood as the most important stage, ... a stage in the development of the Godlike in the
earthly and human." He also emphasises that "the vigorous and complete development and cultivation
of each successive stage depends on the vigorous, complete and characteristic development of
each and all preceding stages."

So the duty of the parent is to "look as deeply as possible into the life of the child to see
what he requires for his present stage of development," and then to "scrutinise the environment
to see what it offers ... to utilise all possibilities of meeting normal needs," to remove
what is hurtful, or at least to "admit its defects" if they cannot give the child what his
nature requires. "If parents offer what the child does not need," he says, "they will destroy
the child's faith in their sympathetic understanding." The educator is to "bring the child
into relations and surroundings in all respects adapted to him" but affording a minimum of
opportunity of injury, "guarding and protecting" but not interfering, unless he is certain
that healthy development has already been interrupted. It is somewhat remarkable that Froebel
anticipated even the conclusions of modern psycho-analysis in his views about childish faults.
Hence the only remedy even for wickedness is to find and foster, build up and guide what has
been repressed. It may be necessary to interfere and even to use severity, but only when the
educator is sure of unhealthy growth. The motto of the biologist on the subject of interference--"When
in doubt, refrain"--exactly expresses Froebel's doctrine of "passive or following" education,
following, that is, the nature of the child, and "passive" as opposed to arbitrary interference.

Free from this, the child will follow his natural impulses, which are to be trusted as much
as those of any other young animal; in other words, he will play, he will manifest his natural
activities. "The young human being--still, as it were, in process of creation--would seek,
though unconsciously yet decidedly and surely, as a product of nature that which is in itself
best, and in a form adapted to his condition, his disposition, his powers and his means. Thus
the duckling hastens to the pond and into the water, while the chicken scratches the ground
and the young swallow catches its food upon the wing. We grant space and time to young plants
and animals because we know that, in accordance with the laws that live in them, they will
develop properly and grow well; arbitrary interference with their growth is avoided because
it would hinder their development; but the young human being is looked upon as a piece of wax,
a lump of clay, which man can mould into what he pleases. O man, who roamest through garden
and field, through meadow and grove, why dost thou close thy mind to the silent teaching of
nature? Behold the weed; grown among hindrances and constraint, how it scarcely yields an indication
of inner law; behold it in nature, in field or garden, how perfectly it conforms to law--a
beautiful sun, a radiant star, it has burst from the earth! Thus, O parents, could your children,
on whom you force in tender years forms and aims against their nature, and who, therefore,
walk with you in morbid and unnatural deformity--thus could your children, too, unfold in beauty
and develop in harmony."

At first play is activity for the sake of activity, not for the sake of results, "of which
the child has as yet no idea." Very soon, however, having man's special capacity of learning
through experience, the child does gather ideas. By this time he has passed through the stage
of infancy, and now his play becomes to the philosopher the highest stage of human development
at this stage, because now it is self-expression.

When Froebel wrote in 1826, there had been but little thought expended on the subject of play,
and probably none on human instincts, which were supposed to be nonexistent. The hope he expressed
that some philosopher would take up these subjects has now been fulfilled, and we ought now
to turn to what has been said on a subject all-important to those who desire to help in the
education of young children.

CHAPTER III

LEARNING BORN OF PLAY

     Play, which is the business of their lives.

There may be nothing new under the sun, but it does seem to be a fair claim to make for Froebel
that no one before or since his time has more fully realised the value to humanity of what
in childhood goes by the name of play. Froebel had distinct theories about play, and he put
his theories into actual practice, not only when he founded the Kindergarten, but in his original
school for older children at Keilhau.

Before going into its full meaning, it may be well first to meet the most common misconception
about play. It is not surprising that those who have given the subject no special consideration
should regard play from the ordinary adult standpoint, and think of it as entirely opposed
to work, as relaxation of effort. But the play of a child covers so much that it is startling
to find a real psychologist writing that "education through play" is "a pernicious proposition."[10]
Statements of this kind spring from the mistaken idea, certainly not derived from observation,
that play involves no effort, that it runs in the line of least resistance, and that education
through play means therefore education without effort, without training in self-control, education
without moral training. The case for the Kindergarten is the opposite of this. Education through
play is advocated just because of the effort it calls forth, just because of the way in which
the child, and later the boy or girl, throws his whole energy into it. What Froebel admired,
what he called "the most beautiful expression of childlife," was "the child that plays thoroughly,
with spontaneous determination, perseveringly, until physical fatigue forbids--a child wholly
absorbed in his play--a child that has fallen asleep while so absorbed." That child, he said,
would be "a thorough determined man, capable of self-sacrifice for the promotion of the welfare
of himself and others." It is because "play is not trivial, but highly serious and of deep
significance," that he appeals to mothers to cultivate and foster it, and to fathers to protect
and guard it.

[Footnote 10: The Educative Process, p. 255 (Bagley).]

The Kindergarten position can be summed up in a sentence from Dr. Clouston's Hygiene of Mind:
"Play is the real work of children." Froebel calls activity of sense and limb "the first germ,"
and "play-building and modelling the tender blossoms of the constructive impulse"; and this,
he says, is "the moment when man is to be prepared for future industry, diligence and productive
activity." He points out, too, the importance of noticing the habits which come from spontaneous
self-employment, which may be habits of indolent ease if the child is not allowed to be as
active as his nature requires.

There were no theories of play in Froebel's day, but he had certainly read Levana, and in all
probability he knew what Schiller had said in his Letters on Aesthetic Education. The play
theories are now too well known to require more than a brief recapitulation.

It will generally be allowed that the distinctive feature of play as opposed to work is that
of spontaneity. The action itself is of no consequence, one man's play is another man's work.
Nor does it seem to matter whence comes the feeling of compulsion in work, whether from pressure
of outer necessity, or from an inner necessity like the compelling force of duty.

In the play of early childhood there may be freedom, not only from adult authority, but even
from the restrictions of nature or of circumstances since "let's pretend" annihilates time
and space and all material considerations.

Among theories of play first comes what is known as the Schiller-Spencer theory, in which play
is attributed to the accumulation of surplus energy. When the human being has more energy than
he requires in order to supply the bodily needs of himself and his family, then he feels impelled
to use it. As the activities of his daily life are the only ones known to him, he fights his
battles over again, he simulates the serious business of life, and transfers, for instance,
the incidents of the chase into a dance. In this Way he reaches artistic creation, so that
"play is the first poetry of the human being."

As an opposite of this we get a Re-creation theory, where play, if not too strenuous, understood
as a change of occupation, rests and re-creates.

Another theory is that of recapitulation, which has been emphasised by Stanley Hall, according
to which children play hunting and chasing games, or find a fascination in making tents, because
they are passing through that stage of development in which their primitive ancestors lived
by hunting or dwelt in tents.

Lastly, a most interesting theory is that which is associated with the name of Groos, and which
is best expressed in the sentence: "Animals do not play because they are young, but they have
their youth because they must play," play being regarded as the preparation for future life
activities. The kitten therefore practises chasing a cork, the puppy worries boots and gloves,
the kid practises jumping, and so on.

A full account of play will probably embrace all these theories, and though they were not formulated
in his day, Froebel overlooked none, though he may have laid special stress on the preparation
side. Yet another value of play emphasised by Professor Royce, viz. its enormous importance
from the point of view of mental initiative, is strongly urged by Froebel. Professor Royce
argues that "in the mere persistence of the playful child one has a factor whose value for
mental initiative it is hard to overestimate." Without this "passionately persistent repetition,"
and without also the constant varying of apparently useless activities, the organism, says
Professor Royce, "would remain the prey of the environment."

To Froebel, as we have seen, the human being is the climax of animal evolution and the starting-point
of psychical development. The lower animal, he maintained, as all will now agree, is hindered
by his definite instincts, but the instincts or instinctive tendencies of the human being are
so undefined that there is room for spontaneity, for new forms of conduct.

Professor Royce says that "a general view of the place which beings with minds occupy in the
physical world strongly suggests that their organisms may especially have significance as places
for the initiation of more or less novel types of activity." And to Froebel the chief significance
of play lies in this spontaneity.

"Play is the highest phase of human development at this stage, because it is spontaneous expression
of what is within produced by an inner necessity and impulse. Play is the most characteristic,
most spiritual manifestation of man at this stage, and, at the same time, is typical of human
life as a whole."

These various theories seem to reinforce rather than to contradict each other, and it is more
important to avoid running any to an extreme than to differentiate between them. In the case
of recapitulation, we must certainly bear in mind Froebel's warning that the child "should
be treated as having in himself the present, past and future." So, as Dr. Drummond says: "If
we feel constrained to present him with a tent because Abraham lived in one, he no doubt enters
into the spirit of the thing and accepts it joyfully. But he also annexes the ball of string
and the coffee canister to fit up telephonic communication with the nursery." He may play robbers
and hide and seek because he has reached a "hunting and capture" stage, but the physiologist
points out that violent exercise is a necessity for his circulation and nutrition, and to practise
swift flight to safety is useful even in modern times.[11] Gardening may take us back to an
agricultural stage, but digging is most useful as a muscular exercise, and "watering" is scientific
experiment and adds to the feeling of power, while the flowers themselves appeal to the aesthetic
side of the sense-play, which is not limited to any age, though conspicuous so soon.

[Footnote 11: An up-to-date riddle asks the difference between the quick and the dead, and
answers, "The quick are those who get out of the way of a motor-bus and the dead are those
who do not."]

Froebel recognised many kinds of play. He realised that much of the play of boyhood is exercise
of physical power, and that it must be of a competitive nature because the boy wants to measure
his power. Even in 1826 he urges the importance not only of town playgrounds but of play leaders,
that the play may be full of life. Among games for boys he noted some still involving sense-play,
as hiding games, colour games and shooting at a mark, which need quick hearing and sight, intellectual
plays exercising thought and judgement, e.g. draughts and dramatic games. One form of play
which seemed to him most important was constructive play, where there is expression of ideas
as well as expression of power. This side of play covers a great deal, and will be dealt with
later; its importance in Froebel's eyes lies in the fact that through construction, however
simple, the child gains knowledge of his own power and learns "to master himself." Froebel
wanted particularly to deepen this feeling of power, and says that the little one who has already
made some experiments takes pleasure in the use of sand and clay, "impelled by the previously
acquired sense of power he seeks to master the material."

In order to gain real knowledge of himself, of his power, a child needs to compare his power
with that of others. This is one reason for the child's ready imitation of all he sees done
by others. Another reason for this is that only through real experience or action can a child
gain the ideas which he will express later, therefore he must reproduce all he sees or hears.

"In the family the child sees parents and others at work, producing, doing something; consequently
he, at this stage, would like to represent what he sees. Be cautious, parents. You can at one
blow destroy, at least for a long time, the impulse to activity and to formation if you repel
their help as childish, useless or even as a hindrance.... Strengthen and develop this instinct;
give to your child the highest he now needs, let him add his power to your work, that he may
gain the consciousness of his power and also learn to appreciate its limitations."

As the child's sense of power and his self-consciousness deepen he requires possessions of
his "very own." Says Froebel: "The feeling of his own power implies and demands also the possession
of his own space and his own material belonging exclusively to him. Be his realm, his province,
a corner of the house or courtyard, be it the space of a box or of a closet, be it a grotto,
a hut or a garden, the boy at this age needs an external point, chosen and prepared by himself,
to which he refers all his activity."

As ideas widen the child's purposes enlarge, and he finds the need for that co-operation which
binds human beings together. And so by play enjoyed in common, the feeling of community which
is present in the little child is raised to recognition of the rights of others; not only is
a sense of justice developed, but also forbearance, consideration and sympathy.

"When the room to be filled is extensive, when the realm to be controlled is large, when the
whole to be produced is complex, then brotherly union of similar-minded persons is in place."
And we are invited to enter an "education room," where boys of seven to ten are using building
blocks, sand, sawdust and green moss brought in from the forest. "Each one has finished his
work and he examines it and that of others, and in each rises the desire to unite all in one
whole," so roads are made from the village of one boy to the castle of another: the boy who
has made a cardboard house unites with another who has made miniature ships from nut-shells,
the house as a castle crowns the hill, and the ships float in the lake below, while the youngest
brings his shepherd and sheep to graze between the mountain and the lake, and all stand and
behold with pleasure and satisfaction the result of their hands.

The educative value of such play has been brought forward in modern times in Floor Games by
Mr. Wells, Magic Cities by Mrs. Nesbit, and notably in Mr. Caldwell Cook's Play City in The
Play Way.

Joining together for a common purpose does not only belong to younger boys. "What busy tumult
among those older boys at the brook! They have built canals, sluices, bridges, etc.... at each
step one trespasses on the limits of another realm. Each one claims his right as lord and maker,
while he recognises the claims of others, and like States, they bind themselves by strict treaties."

"Every town should have its own common playground for the boys. Glorious results would come
from this for the entire community. For, at this period, games, whenever possible, are in common,
and develop the feeling and desire for community, and the laws and requirements of community.
The boy tries to see himself in his companions, to weigh and measure himself by them, to know
and find himself by their help."

"It is the sense of sure and reliable power, the sense of its increase, both as an individual
and as a member of the group, that fills the boy with joy during these games.... Justice, self-control,
loyalty, impartiality, who could fail to catch their fragrance and that of still more delicate
blossoms, forbearance, consideration, sympathy and encouragement for the weaker.... Thus the
games educate the boy for life and awaken and cultivate many social and moral virtues."

In England we have always had respect for boys' games and more and more, especially in America,
people are realising the need for play places and play leaders. But all this was written in
1826, when for ten years Froebel had been experimenting with boys of all ages. At Keilhau play
of all kinds had an honoured place. We read of excursions for all kinds of purposes, of Indian
games out of Fenimore Cooper, and of "Homeric battles." It was "part of Froebel's plan to have
us work with spade and pick-axe," and every boy had his own piece of ground where he might
do what he pleased. Ebers, being literary, constructed in his plot a bed of heather on which
he lay and read or made verses. The boys built their own stage, painted their own scenery,
and in winter once a week they acted classic dramas. Besides this, there was a large and complete
puppet theatre belonging to the school. Bookbinding and carpentry were taught, and at Christmas
"the embryo cabinet-maker made boxes with locks and hinges, finished, veneered and polished."

In England in 1917 we have given to us The Play Way, in which one who has tried it gives the
results of his own experiments in education through play. Mr. Caldwell Cook was not satisfied
with the condition of affairs when "school above the Kindergarten is a nuisance because there
is no play." His dream is that of a Play School Commonwealth, where education, which is the
training of youth, shall be filled with the spirit of youth, namely, "freshness, zeal, happiness,
enthusiasm."

The next chapter will show that it has taken us exactly a hundred years to reach as far as
public recognition of the Nursery School where play is the only possible motive. It is for
the coming generation of teachers to act so that the dream of the Play School Commonwealth
shall be realised more quickly. It is a significant fact that the lines quoted as heading for
the next chapter are written by a modern schoolmaster.

CHAPTER IV

FROM 1816 TO 1919

     Poor mites; you stiffen on a bench
     And stoop your curls to dusty laws;
     Your petal fingers curve and clench
     In slavery to parchment saws;
     You suit your hearts to sallow faces
         In sullen places:
         But no pen
     Nor pedantry can make you men.
     Yours are the morning and the day:
     You should be taught of wind and light;
     Your learning should be born of play.

     (Caged: GEORGE WINTHROP YOUNG.)

Had England but honoured her own prophets, we should have had Nursery Schools a hundred years
ago. In 1816, the year in which Froebel founded his school for older boys at Keilhau, Robert
Owen, the Socialist, "following the plan prescribed by Nature," opened a school where children,
from two to six, were to dance and sing, to be out-of-doors as much as possible, to learn "when
their curiosity induced them to ask questions," and not to be "annoyed with books." They were
to be prevented from acquiring bad habits, to be taught what they could understand, and their
dispositions were to be trained "to mutual kindness and a sincere desire to contribute all
in their power to benefit each other." They "were trained and educated without punishment or
the fear of it.... A child who acted improperly was not considered an object of blame but of
pity, and no unnecessary restraint was imposed on the children."

But the world was not ready. Owen's "Rational Infant School" attracted much notice, and an
Infant School Society was founded. But even the enlightened were incapable of understanding
that any education was possible without books, and the promoters rightly, though quite unconsciously,
condemned themselves when they kept the title Infant School but dropped the qualifying "Rational."
Still, Infant Schools had been started and interest had been aroused. When the edict abolishing
Kindergartens was promulgated in Germany, some of Froebel's disciples passed to other lands,
and Madame von Marenholz came to England in 1854. Already one Kindergarten had been opened
by a Madame Ronge, to which Rowland Hill sent his children, and to which Dickens paid frequent
visits. In the same year there was held in London an "International Educational Exposition
and Congress," and to this Madame von Marenholz sent an exhibit, which was explained by Madame
Ronge, and by a Mr. Hoffmann. Dickens, who had watched the actual working of a Kindergarten,
gave warm support to the new ideas, and wrote an excellent article on "Infant Gardens" for
Household Words, urging "that since children are by Infinite Wisdom so created as to find happiness
in the active exercise and development of all their faculties, we, who have children round
about us, shall no longer repress their energies, tie up their bodies, shut their mouths....
The frolic of childhood is not pure exuberance and waste. 'There is often a high meaning in
childish play,' said Froebel. Let us study it, and act upon the hints--or more than hints--that
Nature gives."

Dr. Henry Barnard represented Connecticut at this Congress, and he took the Kindergarten to
America, in whose virgin soil the seed took root, and quickly brought forth abundantly. But
the soil was virgin and the fields were ready for planting, for America in these days had nothing
corresponding to our Infant Schools. The Kindergarten was welcomed by people of influence.
Dr. Barnard found his first ally in Miss Peabody, one of whose sisters was married to Nathaniel
Hawthorne, while another was the wife of Horace Mann. Miss Peabody began to teach in 1860,
but eight years later, after a visit to Europe, she gave up teaching for propaganda work. Owing
to her efforts the first Free Kindergarten was opened in Boston in 1870. Philanthropists soon
recognised its importance as a social agency, and by 1883 one lady alone supported thirty-one
such institutions in Boston and its surroundings. In New York, Dr. Felix Adler established
a Free Kindergarten in 1878, and Teachers' College was influential in helping to form an association
which supports several. Another name well known in this country is that of Miss Kate Douglas
Wiggin,[12] who was a Kindergarten teacher for many years before she became known as a novelist.
It is Miss Wiggin who tells of a quaint translation of Kindergarten heard by a San Francisco
teacher making friendly visits to the mothers of her children. While she stood on a door-step
sympathising with one poor woman she heard a "loud, but not unfriendly" voice from an upper
window. "Clear things from under foot!" it pealed in stentorian accents. "The teacher o' the
Kids' Guards is comin' down the street."

[Footnote 12: Writer of Penelope in England, etc., and of a capital collection of essays entitled
Children's Rights.]

In England things were very different, because of the Infant Schools which had already been
established, but which had fallen far below the ideal set up by Robert Owen. As every one knows,
the education given in those days to teachers of Elementary Schools was but meagre, and the
results were often so bad that, to justify the expenditure of public money, "payment by results"
was introduced. In 1870 came the Education Act, and the year 1874 saw a good deal of movement.
Miss Caroline Bishop was appointed to lecture to the Infants' teachers under the London School
Board; Miss Heerwart took charge of a training college for Kindergarten teachers in connection
with the British and Foreign School Society; the Froehel Society was founded, and Madame Michaelis
took the Kindergarten into the newly established High Schools for Girls. For the children of
the well-to-do Kindergartens spread rapidly, but for the children of the poor there was no
such happiness; the Infant School was too firmly established as a place where children learned
to read, write and count, and above all to sit still. Infants' teachers received no special
training for their work; their course of study, in which professional training played but a
small part, was the same as that prescribed for the teachers of older children. Some colleges,
notably The Home and Colonial, Stockwell, and Saffron Walden, did try to give their students
some special training, but it was not of much avail, and the word Kindergarten came to mean
not Nursery School, as was the idea of its founder, but dictated exercises with Kindergarten
material, a kind of manual drill supposed to give "hand and eye training," and with this meaning
it made its appearance on the time-table.

Visitors from America were shocked to find no Kindergartens in England, but only large classes
of poor little automatons sitting erect with "hands behind" or worse still "hands on heads,"
and moving only to the word of command. One lady who ultimately found her way to our own Kindergarten
told me that she had been informed at the L.C.C. offices that there were no Kindergartens in
London.

It was partly the scandalised expressions of these American teachers that stimulated Miss Adelaide
Wragge to take her courage into her hands, and in the year 1900 to open the first Mission Kindergarten
in England. She called it a Mission, not a Free Kindergarten, partly because the parents paid
the trifling fee of one penny per week, and partly because it was connected with the parish
work of Holy Trinity, Woolwich, of which her brother was vicar. The first report says: "The
neighbourhood was suitable for the experiment; little children, needing just the kind of training
we proposed to give them, abounded everywhere.... The Woolwich children were typical slum babies,
varying in ages from three to six years; very poor, very dirty, totally untrained in good habits.
At first we only admitted a few, and when these began to improve, gradually increased the numbers
to thirty-five. They needed great patience and care, but they responded wonderfully to the
love given them, and before long they were real Kindergarten children, full of vigour, merriment
and self-activity."

As is done in connection with all Free Kindergartens, Parents' Evenings were instituted from
the first, and the mothers were helped to understand their children by simple talks.

Sesame House for Home Life Training had been opened six months before this Mission Kindergarten.
It was founded by the Sesame Club, and at its head was Miss Schepel, who for twenty years had
been at the head of the Pestalozzi Froebel House. The idea of Home Life Training attracted
students who were not obliged by stern necessity to earn their daily bread. Though the methods
were not quite in line with progressive thought, the atmosphere created by Miss Schepel, warmly
seconded by Miss Buckton,[13] was one of enthusiasm in the service of children. The second
Nursery School in London had its origin in this enthusiasm. Miss Maufe left Sesame House early
in 1903, and started a free Child Garden in West London. Four years later she moved to Westminster
to a block of workmen's dwellings erected on the site of the old Millbank Prison. This "child
garden" has a special interest from the fact that it was carried on actually in a block of
workmen's dwellings like The Children's Houses of a later date. The effort was voluntary and
the rooms were small, but, if the experiment had been supported by the authorities, it would
have been easy to take down dividing walls to get sufficient space. Miss Maufe gave herself
and her income for about twelve years, but difficulties created by the war, the impossibility
of finding efficient help and consequent drain upon her own strength have forced her to close
her little school, to the grief of the mothers in 48 Ruskin Buildings. Another Sesame House
student, Miss L. Hardy, in her charming Diary of a Free Kindergarten, takes us from London
to Edinburgh, but the first Free Kindergarten in Edinburgh began in 1903 and had a different
origin. Miss Howden was an Infants' Mistress in one of the slums, and knew well the needs of
little children in that wide street, once decked with lordly mansions, which leads from the
Castle to Holyrood Palace. Some of the fine houses are left, but the inhabitants are of the
poorest, and Miss Howden left her savings to start a Free Kindergarten in the Canongate. The
sum was not large, but it was seed sown in faith, and its harvest has been abundant, for Edinburgh
with its population of under 400,000 has five Free Kindergartens, in all of which the children
are washed and fed and given restful sleep, as well as taught and trained with intelligence
and love. London with its population of 6,000,000 had but eight up to the time of the outbreak
of the war.

[Footnote 13: Author of the beautiful mystery play of Eager Heart.]

In 1904 the Froebel Society took part in a Joint Conference at Bradford, where one sitting
was devoted to "The Need for Nursery Schools for Children from three to five years at present
attending the Public Elementary Schools." The speakers were Mrs. Miall of Leeds, and Miss K.
Phillips, who had wide opportunities for knowledge of the unsuitable conditions generally provided
for these little children. Among those who joined in this discussion was Miss Margaret M'Millan,
so well known for her pioneer work in connection with School Clinics, and more recently for
her now famous Camp School. Miss M'Millan had already done yeoman service on the Bradford Education
Committee, but was now resident in London, and she had been warmly welcomed on the Council
of the Froebel Society. It was from the date of this Conference that the name Nursery School
became general, though it had been used by Madame Michaelis as early as 1891. In the following
year, 1905, the Board of Education published its "Reports on Children under Five Years of Age,"
with its prefatory memorandum stating that "a new form of school is necessary for poor children,"
and that parents who must send their little ones to school "should send them to nursery schools
rather than to schools of instruction," to schools where there should be "more play, more sleep,
more free conversation, story-telling and observation." It would seem that the recommendations
of 1905 may begin to be carried out in 1919, a consummation devoutly to be wished.

In the meantime voluntary effort has done what it could. Birmingham had good reason to be in
the forefront, since many of its public-spirited citizens had in their own childhood the benefit
of the excellent works of Miss Caroline Bishop, a disciple of Frau Schrader. The Birmingham
People's Kindergarten Association opened its first People's Kindergarten at Greet, in 1904,
and a second, the Settlement Kindergarten, in 1907. Sir Oliver Lodge spoke strongly in favour
of these institutions, calling them a protest against the idea of the comparative unimportance
of childhood.

Miss Hardy opened her Child Garden in 1906, and that work has grown so that the children are
now kept till they are eight years old. The Edinburgh Provincial Council for the Training of
Teachers opened another Free Kindergarten as a demonstration school for Froebelian methods,
a practising school for students, and also as an experimental school, where attempts might
be made to solve problems as to the education of neglected children under school age. It was
the Headmistress of this school, Miss Hodsman, who invented the net beds now in general use.
She wanted something hygienic and light enough to be carried easily into the garden, that in
fine weather the children might sleep out of doors.

Another Sesame House student, Miss Priestman, opened a Free Kindergarten in the pretty village
of Thornton-le-Dale, where the children have a sand-heap in a little enclosure allowed them
by the blacksmith, and sail their boats at a quiet place by the side of the beck that runs
through the village.

It was in 1908 that Miss Esther Lawrence of the Froebel Institute inspired her old students
to help her to open The Michaelis Free Kindergarten. Since the war, the name has been altered
to The Michaelis Nursery School, which is in Netting Dale, on the edge of a very poor neighbourhood,
where large families often occupy a single room. As in the Edinburgh Free Kindergartens, dinner
is provided, for which the parents pay one penny. The first report tells how necessary are
Nursery Schools in such surroundings. "The little child who was formerly tied to the leg of
the bed, and left all day while his mother was out at work, is now enjoying the happy freedom
of the Kindergarten. The child whose clothes were formerly sewn on to him, to save his mother
the periodical labour of sewing on buttons, is now undressed and bathed regularly. The attacks
on children by drunken parents are less frequent. When the Kindergarten was first opened, many
of the children were quite listless, they did not know how to play, did not care to play. Now
they play with pleasure and with vigour, and one can hardly believe they are the listless,
spiritless children of a year ago."

In 1910 Miss Lawrence succeeded in opening what was called from the first the "Somers Town
Nursery School," where the same kind of work is done. One of the reports says: "It is interesting
to see the children sweeping or dusting a room, washing their dusters and dolls' clothes, polishing
the furniture, their shoes, and anything which needs polishing. On Friday morning the 'silver'
is cleaned, and the brilliant results give great pleasure and satisfaction to the little polishers.
'Have you done your work?' was the question addressed to a visitor by a three-year-old child,
and the visitor beat a hasty retreat, ashamed perhaps of being the only drone in the busy hive.
At dinner time four children wait on the rest, and very well and quickly the food is handed
round and the plates removed."

There are other Free Kindergartens at work. One is in charge of Miss Rowland, and is in connection
with the Bermondsey Settlement. It is Miss Rowland who tells of the "candid mother" she met
one Saturday who remarked, "I told the children to wash their faces in case they met you."

The Phoenix Park Kindergarten in Glasgow is interesting because the site was granted by an
enlightened Corporation and the Parks Committee laid out the garden, while the real start came
from the pupils of a school for girls of well-to-do families. By this time other social agencies
have been grouped round the Kindergarten as a centre.

The Caldecott Nursery School was opened in 1911 and has grown into the Caldecott Community,
which has now taken its children to live altogether in the country. This Nursery School was
never intended to be a Kindergarten; it was started as an interesting experiment, "chiefly
perhaps in the hope that the children might enjoy that instruction which is usually absorbed
by the children of the wealthy in their own nurseries by virtue of their happier surroundings."

And in the very year in which we were plunged into war Miss Margaret M'Millan put into actual
shape what she had long thought of, and opened her "Baby Camp" and Nursery School, with a place
for "toddlers" in between, the full story of which is told in The, Camp School. In the Camp
itself the things which impress the visitor most are first the space and the fresh air, the
sky above and the brown earth below, and next the family feeling which is so plain in spite
of the numbers. The Camp existed long before it was a Baby Camp and Nursery School, for Miss
M'Millan began with a School Clinic and went on to Open-Air Camps for girls and for boys, before
going to the "preventive and constructive" work of the Baby Camp. Clean and healthy bodies
come first, but to Miss M'Millan's enthusiasm everything in life is educative.

The war has increased the supply of Nursery Schools, because the need for them has become glaringly
apparent. Many experiments are going on now, and it seems as if experimental work would be
encouraged, not hampered by unyielding regulations. The Nursery School should cover the ages
for which the Kindergarten was instituted, roughly from three to six years old. Already there
are excellent baby rooms in some parts of London, and no doubt in other towns, and the only
reason for disturbing these is to provide the children with more space and more fresh air,
or with something resembling a garden rather than a bare yard.

One school in London has a creche or day nursery, not exactly a part of it, but in closest
touch, established owing to the efforts of an enthusiastic Headmistress working along with
the Norland Place nurses. Its space is at present insufficient, but the neighbouring buildings
are condemned, and will come down after the war. They need not go up again. Then the space
could be used in the same way as in the Camp School. That would be to the benefit of the whole
neighbourhood, and there could be at least one experiment where from creche to Standard VII.
might be in close connection.

Miss M'Millan's ideal is to have a large space in the centre of a district with covered passages
radiating from it so that mothers from a large area could bring their little ones and leave
them in safety. It would be safety, it would be salvation. But, as the Scots proverb has it,
"It is a far cry to Loch Awe."

Another question much debated is, who is to be in charge of these children. The day nursery
or crèche must undoubtedly be staffed with nurses, but with nurses trained to care for children,
not merely sick nurses. There are, however, certain people who believe that the "trained nurse"
is the right person to be in charge of children up to five, while others think that young girls
or uneducated women will suffice. We are thankful that the Board of Education takes up the
position that a well-educated and specially trained teacher is to be the person responsible.

We certainly want the help both of the trained nurse and of the motherly woman. The trained
nurse will be far more use in detecting and attending to the ailments of children than the
teacher can be, and the motherly woman can give far more efficient help in training children
to decent habits than any young probationer, useful though these may be. But there is always
the fear that the nurses may think that good food and cleanliness are all a child requires,
and, as Miss M'Millan says, "The sight of the toddlers' empty hands and mute lips does not
trouble them at all."

But every man to his trade, and though the teacher in charge must know something about ailing
children, it is very doubtful if a few months in a hospital will advantage her much. Here she
trenches on the province of the real nurse, whose training is thorough, and the little knowledge,
as every one knows, is sometimes dangerous. One Nursery School teacher, with years of experience,
says that what she learned in hospital has been of no use to her, and it is probable that attendance
at a clinic for children would be really more useful. Certainly the main concern of the Nursery
School teacher is sympathetic understanding of children. There must be no more of Punch's "Go
and see what Tommy is doing in the next room and tell him not to," but "Go and see what Tommy
is trying to accomplish, and make it possible for him to carry on his self-education through
that 'fostering of the human instincts of activity, investigation and construction' which constitutes
a Kindergarten."

CHAPTER V

"THE WORLD'S MINE OYSTER"

If early education, consist in fostering natural activities, there can be no doubt that Froebel
hit upon the activity most prominent of all in the case of young children, viz. the impulse
to investigate. For his crest, the little child should share in the "motto given to the mongoose
family, in Kipling's Rikki-Tikki, 'Run and find out.'"

Most writers on the education of young children have emphasised the importance of what is most
inadequately called sense training, and it is here that Dr. Montessori takes her stand with
her "didactic apparatus." Froebel's ideas seem wider; he realises that the sword with which
the child opens his oyster is a two-edged sword, that he uses not only his sense organs as
tools for investigation, but his whole body. His pathway to knowledge, and to power over himself
and his surroundings, is action, and action of all kinds is as necessary to him as the use
of his senses.

"The child's first utterance is force," says Froebel, and his first discovery is the resistance
of matter, when he "pushes with his feet against what resists them." His first experiments
are with his body, "his first toys are his own limbs," and his first play is the use of "body,
senses and limbs" for the sake of use, not for result. One use of his body is the imitation
of any moving object, and Froebel tells the mother:

  If your child's to understand
  Action in the world without,
  You must let his tiny hand
  Imitative move about.
  This is the reason why
  Baby will, never still,
  Imitate whatever's by.

At this stage the child is "to move freely, and be active, to grasp and hold with his own hands."
He is to stand "when he can sit erect and draw himself up," not to walk till he "can creep,
rise freely, maintain his balance and proceed by his own effort." He is not to be hindered
by swaddling bands--such as are in use in Continental countries--nor, later on, to be "spoiled
by too much assistance," words which every mother and teacher should write upon her phylacteries.
But as soon as he can move himself the surroundings speak to the child, "outer objects invite
him to seize and grasp them, and if they are distant, they invite him who would bring them
nearer to move towards them."

This use of the word "invite" is worthy of notice, and calls to mind a sentence used by a writer
on Freud,[14] that "the activity of a human being is a constant function of his environment."
We adults, who are so ready with our "Don't touch," must endeavour to remember how everything
is shouting to a child: "Look at me, listen to me, come and fetch me, and find out all you
can about me by every means in your power."

[Footnote 14: The Freudian Wish, Edwin Holt.]

If we have anything to do with little children, we must face the fact that the child is, if
not quite a Robinson Crusoe on his island, at least an explorer in a strange country, and a
scientist in his laboratory. But there is nothing narrow in his outlook: the name of this chapter
is deliberately chosen, the whole world is the child's oyster, his interests are all-embracing.

From his first walk he is the geographer. "Each little walk is a tour of discovery; each object--the
chair, the wall--is an America, a new world, which he either goes around to see if it be an
island, or whose coast he follows to discover if it be a continent. Each new phenomenon is
a discovery in the child's small and yet rich world, e.g. one may go round the chair; one may
stand before it, behind it, but one cannot go behind the bench or the wall."

Then comes an inquiry into the physical properties of surrounding objects. "The effort to reach
a particular object may have its source in the child's desire to hold himself firm and upright
by it, but we also observe that it gives him pleasure to touch, to feel, to grasp, and perhaps
also--which is a new phase of activity--to be able to move it.... The chair is hard or soft;
the seat is smooth; the corner is pointed; the edge is sharp." The business of the adult, Froebel
goes on to say, is to supply these names, "not primarily to develop the child's power of speech,"
but "to define his sense impressions."

Next, the scientist must stock his laboratory with material for experiment.

"The child is attracted by the bright round smooth pebble, by the gaily fluttering bit of paper,
by the smooth bit of board, by the rectangular block, by the brilliant quaint leaf. Look at
the child that can scarcely keep himself erect, that can walk only with the greatest care--he
sees a twig, a bit of straw; painfully he secures it, and like the bird carries it to his nest.
See him again, laboriously stooping and slowly going forward on the ground, under the eaves
of the roof (the deep eaves of the Thuringian peasant house). The force of the rain has washed
out of the sand smooth bright pebbles, and the ever-observing child gathers them as building
stones as it were, as material for future building. And is he wrong? Is he not in truth collecting
material for his future life building?"

The "box of counters, and the red-veined stone," the brilliant quaint leaf, the twig, the bit
of straw, all the child's treasures--these are the stimuli which, according to the biologist
educator, must be supplied if the activities appropriate to each stage are to be called forth.
Every one knows for how long a period a child can occupy himself examining, comparing and experimenting.

"Like things," says Froebel, "must be ranged together, unlike things separated.... The child
loves all things that enter his small horizon and extend his little world. To him the least
thing is a new discovery, but it must not come dead into the little world, nor lie dead therein,
lest it obscure the small horizon and crush the little world. Therefore the child would know
why he loves this thing, he would know all its properties. For this reason he examines the
object on all sides; for this reason he tears and breaks it; for this reason he puts it in
his mouth and bites it. We reprove the child for naughtiness and foolishness; and yet he is
wiser than we who reprove him."

This experimenting is one side of a child's play, and the things with which he thus experiments
are his toys, or, as Froebel puts it, "play material." Much of this is and ought to be self
found, and where the child can find his own toys he asks for little more. The seaside supplies
him with sand and water, stones, shells, rock pools, seaweed, and he asks us for nothing but
a spade, which digs deeper than his naked hands, and a pail to carry water, which hands alone
cannot convey.

  The vista of the sand
  is the child's free land;
  where the grown-ups seem half afraid;
  even nurse forgets to sniff
  and to call "come here"
  as she sits very near
  to the far up cliff
  and you venture alone with your spade....

Even indoors, a child could probably find for himself all the material for investigation, all
the stimuli he requires, if it were not that his investigations interfere with adult purposes.
Even in very primitive times the child probably experimented upon the revolving qualities of
his mother's spindle till she found it more convenient to let him have one for himself, and
it became a toy or top.

Froebel, who made so much of play, to whom it was spontaneous education and self realisation,
was bound to see that toys were important. "The man advanced in insight," he said, "even when
he gives his child a plaything, must make clear to himself its purpose and the purpose of playthings
and occupation material in general. This purpose is to aid the child freely to express what
lies within him, and to bring the outer world nearer to him, and thus to serve as mediator
between the mind and the world." Froebel's "Gifts" were an attempt to supply right play material.
True to his faith in natural impulse, Froebel watched children to see what playthings they
found for themselves, or which, among those presented by adults, were most appreciated. Soft
little coloured balls seemed right material for a baby's tender hand, and it was clear that
when the child could crawl about he was ready for something which he could roll on the floor
and pursue on all fours. As early as two years old he loves to take things out of boxes and
to move objects about, so boxes of bricks were supplied, graded in number and in variety of
form. Not for a moment did Froebel suggest that the child was to be limited to these selected
playthings, he expressly stated the contrary, and he frequently said that spontaneity was not
to be checked. But from what has followed, from the way in which these little toys have been
misused, we are tempted to speculate on whether these "Gifts" supplied that definite foundation
without which, in these days, no notice would have been taken of the new ideas, or whether
they have proved the sunken rock on which much that was valuable has perished. The world was
not ready to believe in the educational value of play, just pure play. Nor is it yet. For the
new system in its "didactic" apparatus out-Froebels Froebel in his mistake of trying to systematise
the material for spontaneous education. Carefully planned, as were Froebel's own "gifts," the
new apparatus presents a series of exercises in sense discrimination, satisfying no doubt while
unfamiliar, but suffering from the defect of the "too finished and complex plaything," in which
Froebel saw a danger "which slumbers like a viper under the roses."

"To realise his aims, man, and more particularly the child, requires material, though it be
only a bit of wood or a pebble, with which he makes something or which he makes into something.
In order to lead the child to the handling of material we give him the ball, the cube and other
bodies, the Kindergarten gifts. Each of these gifts incites the child to free spontaneous activity,
to independent movement."

Froebel would have sympathised deeply with the views of Peter as expressed by Mr. Wells in
regard to Ideals, which he, however, called toys:

"The theory of Ideals played almost as important a part in the early philosophy of Peter as
it did in the philosophy of Plato. But Peter did not call them Ideals, he called them 'toys.'
Toys were the simplified essences of things, pure, perfect and manageable. Real things were
troublesome, uncontrollable, over-complicated and largely irrelevant. A Real Train, for example,
was a poor, big, clumsy, limited thing that was obliged to go to Redhill, or Croydon, or London,
that was full of unnecessary strangers, usually sitting firmly in the window seats, that you
could do nothing with at all. A Toy Train was your very own; it took you wherever you wanted,
to Fairyland, or Russia, or anywhere, at whatever pace you chose."[15]

[Footnote 15: Joan and Peter, p. 77.]

Froebel asks what presents are most prized by the child and by mankind in general, and answers,
"Those which afford him a means of developing his mind, of giving it freest activity, of expressing
it clearly." For her ideas as to educative material Dr. Montessori went, not to normal life,
not even to children, but to what may he called curative appliances, to the material invented
by Séguin to develop the dormant powers of defective children. She herself came to the study
of education from the medical side, the curative. Froebel, with his belief in human instinct,
naturally went to what he called the mother's room, which we should call the nursery, and to
the garden where the child finds his "bright round smooth pebble" and his "brilliant quaint
leaf." No one would seek to under-value the importance of sense discrimination, but it can
be exercised without formalism, and it need not be mere discrimination. It is in connection
with the Taste and Smell games that Froebel tells the mother that "the higher is rooted in
the lower, morality in instinct, the spiritual in the material." The baby enjoys the scent,
thanks the kind spirit that put it there, and must let mother smell it too, so from the beginning
there is a touch of aesthetic pleasure and a recognition of "what the dear God is saying outside."
As to how sense discrimination may be exercised without formality, there is a charming picture
in The Camp School:

"And then that sense of Smell, which got so little exercise and attention that it went to sleep
altogether, so that millions get no warning and no joy through it. We met the need for its
education in the Baby Camp by having a Herb Garden. Back from the shelters and open ground,
in a shady place, we have planted fennel, mint, lavender, sage, marjoram, thyme, rosemary,
herb gerrard and rue. And over and above these pungently smelling things there are little fields
of mignonette. We have balm, indeed, everywhere in our garden. The toddlers go round the beds
of herbs, pinching the leaves with their tiny fingers and then putting their fingers to their
noses. There are two little couples going the rounds just now. One is a pair of new comers,
very much astonished, the other couple old inhabitants, delighted to show the wonders of the
place! Coming back with odorous hands, they perhaps want to tell us about the journey. Their
eyes are bright, their mouths open."

In Chapter II. we quoted the biologist educator's ideal conception of the surroundings best
suited to bring about right development. Let us now visit one or two actual Kindergartens and
see if these conditions are in any way realised by the followers of Froebel.

The first one we enter is certainly a large bright room, for one side is open to light, with
two large windows, and between them glass doors opening into the playground. There is no heap
of sand in a corner, nor is there a tub of water; for the practical teacher knows how little
hands, if not little feet, with their vigorous but as yet uncontrolled movements would splash
the water and scatter the sand with dire effects as to the floor, which the theorist fondly
imagines would always be clean enough to sit upon. But there is a sand-tray big enough and
deep enough for six to eight children to use individually or together. As spontaneous activity,
with its ceaseless efforts at experimenting, ceaselessly spills the sand, within easy reach
are little brushes and dustpans to remedy such mishaps. The sand-tray is lined with zinc so
that the sand can be replaced by water for boats and ducks, etc., when desired.

The low wall blackboard is there ready for use. Bright pictures are on the walls, well drawn
and well coloured, some from nursery rhymes, some of Caldecott's, a frieze of hen and chickens,
etc. Boxes for houses and shops are not in evidence, but their place is taken by bricks of
such size and quantity that houses, shops, motors, engines and anything else may be built large
enough for the children themselves to be shopkeepers or drivers, and there are also pieces
of wood to use for various purposes of construction. There is no cooking stove, but simple
cooking can be carried out on an open fire, and when a baking oven is required, an eager procession
makes its way to the kitchen, where a kindly housekeeper permits the use of her oven. There
is a doll's cot with a few dolls of various sizes. There are flowers and growing bulbs. There
are light low tables and chairs, a family of guinea pigs in a large cage, and there is a cupboard
which the children can reach.

Water is to be found in a passage room, between the Kindergarten and the rooms for children
above that stage, and here, so placed that the children themselves can find and reach everything,
are the sawdust, bran and oats for the guinea pigs, with a few carrots and a knife to cut them,
some tiny scrubbing-brushes and a wiping-up cloth. Here also are stored the empty boxes, corrugated
paper and odds and ends in constant demand for constructions.

In the cupboard there are certain shelves from which anything may be taken, and some from which
nothing may be taken without leave. For the teacher here is of opinion that children of even
three and four are not too young to begin to learn the lesson of meum and tuum, and she also
thinks it is good to have some treasures which do not come out every day, and which may require
more delicate handling than the ordinary toy ought to need. For this ought to be strong enough
to bear unskilled handling and vigorous movements, for a broken toy ought to be a tragedy.
At the same time it is part of a child's training to learn to use dainty objects with delicate
handling, and such things form the children's art gems, showing beauty of construction and
of colour. Children as well as grown-ups have their bad days, when something out of the usual
is very welcome. "Do you know there's nothing in this world that I'm not tired of?" was said
one day by a boy of six usually quite contented. "Give me something out of the cupboard that
I've never seen before," said another whose digestion was troublesome. The open shelves contain
pencils and paper, crayons, paint-boxes, boxes of building blocks, interlocking blocks, wooden
animals, jigsaw and other puzzles, coloured tablets for pattern laying, toy scales, beads to
thread, dominoes, etc., the only rule being that what is taken out must be tidily replaced.
This Kindergarten is part of a large institution, and the playground, to which it has direct
access, is of considerable extent. There is a big stretch of grass and another of asphalt,
so that in suitable weather the tables and chairs, the sand-tray, the bricks and anything else
that is wanted can be carried outside so that the children can live in the open, which of course
is better than any room. In the playground there is a bank where the children can run up and
down, and there are a few planks and a builder's trestle,[16] on which they can be poised for
seesaws or slides, and these are a constant source of pleasure.

[Footnote 16: See p. 55.]

In another Kindergarten we find the walls enlivened with Cecil Aldin's fascinating friezes:
here is Noah with all the animals walking in cheerful procession, and in the next room is an
attractive procession of children with push-carts, hoops and toy motor cars. When we make our
visit the day is fine and the room is empty, the children are all outside. The garden is not
large, but there is some space, and under the shade of two big trees we find rugs spread, on
which the children are sitting, standing, kneeling and lying, according to their occupation.
One is building with large blocks, and must stand up to complete her erection; another is lying
flat putting together a jigsaw; another, a boy, is threading beads; while another has built
railway arches, and with much whistling and the greatest carefulness is guiding his train through
the tunnels. The play is almost entirely individual, but very often you hear, "O Miss X, do
come and see what I've done!" After about an hour, during which a few of the children have
changed their occupations, those who wish to do so join some older children who are playing
games involving movement. This may be a traditional game like Looby Loo, or Round and round
the Village, or it may be one of the best of the old Kindergarten games. After lunch the washing
up is to be done in a beautiful new white sink which is displayed with pride.

Our next visit is to a Free Kindergarten. The rooms are quite as attractive, as rich in charming
friezes as in the others, and the furnishing in some ways is much the same. But here we see
what we have not seen before, for here is a large room filled with tiny hammock beds. The windows
are wide open, but the blinds are down, for the children are having their afternoon sleep.

Here, as in all Free Kindergartens, the children are provided with simple but pretty overalls
which the parents are pleased to wash. House shoes are also provided, partly to minimise the
noise from active little feet, but principally because the poor little boots are often a painfully
inadequate protection from wet pavements. The children are trained to tidy ways and to independence.
They cannot read, but by picture cards they recognise their own beds, pegs and other properties.
They take out and put away their own things, and give all reasonable help in laying tables
and serving food, in washing, dusting and sweeping up crumbs, as is done in any true Kindergarten.

In the garden of this Free Kindergarten there is a large sand-pit, surrounded by a low wooden
framework, and having a pole across the middle so that it resembles a cucumber frame and a
cover can be thrown over the sand to keep it clean when not in use.

Froebel's own list of playthings contains, besides balls and building blocks, coloured beads,
coloured tablets for laying patterns, coloured papers for cutting, folding and plaiting; pencils,
paints and brushes; modelling clay and sand; coloured wool for sewing patterns and pictures;
and such little sticks and laths as children living in a forest region find for themselves.
Considered in themselves, apart from the traditions of formality, these are quite good play
material or stimuli, and Froebel meant the time to come "when we shall speak of the doll and
the hobby horse as the first plays of the awakening life of the girl and the boy," but he died
before he had done so. In the Mother Songs, too, we find quite a good list of toys which are
now to be found in most Kindergartens.

Toys for the playground should be provided--a sand-heap, a seesaw, a substantial wheel-barrow,
hoops, balls, reins and perhaps skipping-ropes. Something on which the child can balance, logs
or planks which they can move about, and a trestle on which these can be supported, are invaluable.
It was while an addition was being made to our place that we realised the importance of such
things, and, as in Froebel's case, "our teachers were the children themselves." They were so
supremely happy running up and down the plank roads laid by the builders for their wheel-barrows,
seesawing or balancing and sliding on others, that we could not face the desolation of emptiness
which would come when the workmen removed their things. So, for a few pounds, all that the
children needed was secured, ordinary planks for seesawing, narrower for balancing and a couple
of trestles. One exercise the children had specially enjoyed was jumping up and down on yielding
planks, and this the workmen had forbidden because the planks might crack. But a sympathetic
foreman told us what was needed: two planks of special springy wood were fastened together
by cross pieces at each end, and besides making excellent slides, these made most exciting
springboards.

For representations of real life the children require dolls and the simplest of furniture--a
bed, which need only be a box, some means of carrying out the doll's washing, her personal
requirements as well as her clothes; some little tea-things and pots and pans. A doll's house
is not necessary, and can only be used by two or three children, but will be welcomed if provided,
and its appointments give practice in dainty handling. Trains and signals of some kind, home-made
or otherwise; animals for farm or Zoo; a pair of scales for a shop, and some sort of delivery
van, which, of course, may be home-made.

There must also be provision for increase of skill and possibility of creation. If the Kindergarten
can afford it, some of the Montessori material may be provided; there is no reason, except
expense, why it should not be used if the children like it, and if it does not take up too
much room. But it has no creative possibilities, and even at three years old this is required.
Scissors are an important tool, and an old book of sample wall-papers is most useful; old match-boxes
and used matches, paste and brushes and some old magazines to cut. Blackboard chalks and crayons,
paint-boxes with four to six important colours, some Kindergarten folding papers, all these
supply colour. Certain toys seem specially suited to give hand control, e.g. a Noah's Ark,
where the small animals are to be set out carefully, tops or teetotums and tiddlywinks, at
which some little children become proficient. The puzzle interest must not be forgotten, and
simple jigsaw pictures give great pleasure. It is interesting to note here that the youngest
children fit these puzzles not by the picture but by form, though they know they are making
a picture and are pleased when it is finished. The puzzle with six pictures on the sides of
cubes is much more difficult than a simple jigsaw.

All sorts of odds and ends come in useful, and especially for the poorer children these should
be provided. Any one who remembers the pleasure derived from coloured envelope bands, from
transparent paper from crackers, and from certain advertisements, will save these for children
to whose homes such treasures never come. A box containing scraps of soft cloth, possibly a
bit of velvet, some bits of smooth and shining coloured silk give the pleasure of sense discrimination
without the formality of the Montessori graded boxes, and are easier to replace. Some substitute
for "mother's button box," a box of shells or coloured seeds, a box of feathers, all these
things will be played with, which means observation and discrimination, comparison and contrast,
and in addition, where colour is involved, there is aesthetic pleasure, and this also enters
into the touching of smooth or soft surfaces. Softness is a joy to children, as is shown in
the woolly lambs, etc., provided for babies. A little one of my acquaintance had a bit of blanket
which comforted many woes, and when once I offered her a feather boa as a substitute she sobbed
out: "It isn't so soft as the blanket!"

In one of Miss McMillan's early books she wrote: "Very early the child begins more or less
consciously to exercise the basal sense--the sense of touch. On waking from sleep he puts his
tiny hands to grasp something, or turns his head on the firm soft pillow. He touches rather
than looks, at first (for his hands and fingers perform a great many movements long before
he learns to turn his eyeballs in various directions or follow the passage even of a light),
and through touching many things he begins his education. If he is the nursling of wealthy
parents, it is possible that his first exercises are rather restricted. He touches silk, ivory,
muslin and fine linen. That is all, and that is not much. But the child of the cottager is
often better off, for his mother gives him a great variety of objects to keep him quiet. The
ridiculous command, 'Do not touch,' cannot be imposed on him while he is screaming in his cradle
or protesting in his dinner chair; and so all manner of things--reels, rings, boxes, tins,
that is to say a variety of surfaces--is offered to him, to his great delight and advantage.
And lest he should not get the full benefit of such privilege he carries everything to his
mouth, where the sense of touch is very keen."[17]

[Footnote 17: Early Childhood: Swan Sonnenschein, published 1900.]

Among the treasures kept for special occasions there may be pipes for soap-bubbles, a prism
of some kind with which to make rainbows, a tiny mirror to make "light-birds" on the wall and
ceiling, and a magnet with the time-honoured ducks and fish, if these are still to be bought,
along with other articles, delicately made or coloured, which require care.

Pictures and picture-books should also be considered; some being in constant use, some only
brought out occasionally. For the very smallest children some may be rag books, but always
children should be taught to treat books carefully. The pictures on the walls ought to be changed,
sometimes with the children's help, sometimes as a surprise and discovery. For that purpose
it is convenient to have series of pictures in frames with movable backs, but brown-paper frames
will do quite well. The pictures belonging to the stories which have been told to the children
ought to have a prominent place, and if the little ones desire to have one retold they will
ask for it.

It is of course not at all either necessary or even desirable for any one school to have everything,
and children should not have too much within the range of their attention at one time. Individual
teachers will make their own selections, but in all cases there must be sufficient variety
of material for each child to carry out his natural desire for observation, experiment and
construction.

CHAPTER VI

"ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE"

     A wedding or a festival, a mourning or a funeral...
     As if his whole vocation were endless imitation.

In every country and in every age those who have eyes to see have watched the same little dramas.
What Wordsworth saw was seen nineteen hundred years ago in the Syrian market-place, where the
children complained of their unresponsive companions: "We have piped the glad chaunt of the
marriage, but ye have not danced, we have wailed our lamentation, but ye have not joined our
mourning procession."

Since the very name Kindergarten is to imply a teaching which fulfils the child's own wants
and desires, it must supply abundant provision for the dramatic representation of life. Adults
have always been ready to use for their own purposes the strong tendency to imitate, which
is a characteristic of all normal children, but few even now realise to what extent a child
profits by his imitative play. The explanation that Froebel found for this will now be generally
accepted, viz. that only by acting it out can a child fully grasp an idea, "For what he tries
to represent or do, he begins to understand." He thinks in action, or as one writer put it,
he "apperceives with his muscles." This explanation seems to cover imitative play, from the
little child's imitative wave of the hand up to such elaborate imitations as are described
in Stanley Hall's Story of a Sand Pile,[18] or in Dewey's Schools of To-morrow. But when we
think of the joy of such imaginative play as that of Red Indians, shipwrecks and desert islands,
we feel that these show a craving for experience, for life, such a craving as causes the adult
to lose himself in a book of travels or in a dramatic performance, and which explains the phenomenal
success of the cinema, poor stuff as it is.

[Footnote 18: Or that delightful "Play Town" in The Play Way.]

We thirst for experiences, even for those which are unpleasant; we wonder "how it feels" to
be up in an aeroplane or down in a submarine. We are far indeed from desiring air-raids, but
if such things must be, there is a curious satisfaction in being "in it." And though the experiences
they desire may be matters of everyday occurrence to us, children probably feel the craving
even more keenly. "You may write what you like," said a teacher, and a somewhat inarticulate
child wrote, "I was out last night, it was late." "Why, Jack," said another, "you've painted
your cow green; did you ever see a green cow?" "No," said Jack, "but I'd like to."

In early Kindergarten days this imitative and dramatic tendency was chiefly met in games, and
the children were by turns butterflies and bees, bakers and carpenters, clocks and windmills.
The programme was suggested by Froebel's Mother Songs, in which he deals with the child's nearest
environment. Too often, indeed, the realities to which Froebel referred were not realities
to English children, but that was recognised as a defect, and the ideas themselves were suitable.
Chickens, pigeons and farmyard animals; the homely pussy cat or canary bird; the workers to
whom the child is indebted, farmer, baker, miner, builder or carpenter; the sun, the rain,
the rainbow and the "light-bird"--such ideas were chosen as suitable centres, and stories and
songs, games and handwork clustered round.

What was the reason for this binding of things together? Why did Froebel constantly plead for
"unity" even for the tiny child, and tell us to link together his baby finger-games or his
first weak efforts at building with his blocks chairs, tables, beds, walls and ladders?

Looking back over the years, it seems as if this idea of joining together has been trying to
assert itself under various forms, each of which has reigned for its day, has been carried
to extremes and been discarded, only to come up again in a somewhat different form. It has
always seemed to aim at extending and ordering the mind content of children. For the Froebelian
it was expressed in such words as "unity," "connectedness" and "continuity," while the Herbartians
called it "correlation." Under these terms much work has been, and is still being, carried
out, some very good and some very foolish. Ideas catch on, however, because of the truth that
is in them, not because of the error which is likely to be mixed with it, and even the weakest
effort after connection embodies an important truth. When we smile over absurd stories of forced
"correlation," we seldom stop to think of what went on before the Kindergarten existed, for
instance the still more absurd and totally disconnected lists of object lessons. One actual
list for children of four years old ran: Soda, Elephant, Tea, Pig, Wax, Cow, Sugar, Spider,
Potatoes, Sheep, Salt, Mouse, Bread, Camel.

Kindergarten practice was far ahead of this, for here the teacher was expected to choose her
material according to (1) Time of Year; (2) Local Conditions, such as the pursuits of the people;
(3) Social Customs. When it was possible the children went to see the real blacksmith or the
real cow, and to let game or handwork be an expression, and a re-ordering of ideas gained was
natural and right. Connectedness, however, meant more than this, it meant that the material
itself was to be treated so that the children would be helped to that real understanding which
comes from seeing things in their relations to each other. As Lloyd Morgan puts it, "We are
mainly at work upon the mental background.

According to Professor Dewey, some such linking or joining is necessary "to foster that sense
which is at the basis of attention and of all intellectual growth, the sense of continuity."
The Herbartian correlation was designed to further that well-connected circle of thought out
of which would come the firm will, guided by right insight, inspired by true feeling, which
is their aim in education.

Froebelian unity and connectedness have, like the others, an intellectual and a moral aspect.
Intellectually "the essential characteristic of instruction is the treatment of individual
things in their relationships"; morally, the idea of unity is that we are all members one of
another. The child who, through unhindered activity, has reached the stage of self-consciousness
is to go on to feel himself a part, a member of an ever-increasing whole--family, school, township,
country, humanity--the All; to be "one with Nature, man and God."

Every one has heard something of the new teaching--which, by the way, sheds clearer light over
Froebel's warning against arbitrary interference--viz. that a great part of the nervous instability
which affects our generation is due to the thwarting and checking of the natural impulses of
early years. But this new school also gives us something positive, and reinforces older doctrines
by telling us to integrate behaviour. "This matter of the unthwarted lifelong progress of behaviour
integration is of profound importance, for it is the transition from behaviour to conduct.
The more integrated behaviour is harmonious and consistent behaviour toward a larger and more
comprehensive situation, toward a bigger section of the universe; it is lucidity and breadth
of purpose. The child playing with fire is only wrong conduct because it is behaviour that
does not take into account consequences; it is not adjusted to enough of the environment; it
will be made right by an enlargement of its scope and reach."[19]

All selfish conduct, all rudeness and roughness come from ignorance; we are all more or less
self-centred, and the child's consciousness of self has to be widened, his scope has to be
enlarged to sympathy with the thoughts, feelings and desires of other selves. "The sane man
is the man who (however limited the scope of his behaviour) has no such suppression incorporated
in him. The wise man must be sane and must have scope as well."[20]

[Footnote 19: The Freudian Wish, Edwin Holt.]

[Footnote 20: The Freudian Wish, Edwin Holt.]

Professor Earl Barnes always used to describe the child mind as "scrappy." How can we best
aid development into the wholeness or healthiness and the scope of sanity and wisdom? For it
may well be that this widening and ordering of experience, of consciousness, of behaviour into
moral behaviour is our most important task as teachers. Froebel emphasised the "crying need"
for connection of school and life, pointing out how the little child desires to imitate and
the older to share in all that, as Professor Dewey puts it, is "surcharged with a sense of
the mysterious values that attach to whatever their elders are concerned with."

It is in this connection that he says the Kindergarten teacher has the opportunity to foster
that most important "sense of continuity."

Since Professor Dewey gave to the world the results of his experimental school, all the Kindergartens
and most of the Infant Schools in England have tried to carry out their accustomed reproduction
of home surroundings, more or less on the lines of the Primary Department of his experimental
school. They have extended their scope, and in addition to the material already taken from
workman and shop, from garden and farm, have also with much profit to older children used his
suggestions about primitive industries.

Reproduction of home surroundings can be done in many ways, one of which is to help the children
to furnish and to play with a doll's house. But the play must be play. It is not enough to
use the drama as merely offering suggestions for handwork, and one small doll's house does
not allow of real play for more than one or two children.

Our own children used to settle this by taking out the furniture, etc., and arranging different
homes around the room. I can remember the never-ending pleasure given by similar play in my
own nursery days, when the actors were the men and boys supplied by tailors' advertisements.
Many and varied were the experiences of these paper families, families, it may be noted, none
of whom demeaned themselves so far as to possess any womankind. For that nursery party of five
had lost its mother sadly early and was ruled by two boys, who evidently thought little of
the other sex.

Professor Dewey tells us that "nothing is more absurd than to suppose that there is no middle
term between leaving a child to his unguided fancies, or controlling his activities by a formal
succession of dictated directions." It is the teacher's business to know what is striving for
utterance and to supply the needed stimulus and materials.

To show how under the inspiration of a thoroughly capable teacher this continuity may be secured
and prolonged for quite a long period, an example may be taken from the work of Miss Janet
Payne, who is remarkably successful in meeting and stimulating, without in any way forcing
the "striving for utterance" mentioned by Dewey. On this occasion Miss Payne produced a doll
about ten inches high, dressed to resemble the children's fathers, and suggested that a home
should be made for him. The children adopted him with zeal, named him Mr. Bird, and his career
lasted for two years.

Mr. Bird required a family, so Mrs. Bird had to be produced with her little girl Winnie, and
later a baby was added to the family. Beds, tables and chairs, including a high chair for Winnie,
were made of scraps from the wood box, and for a long time Mr. Bird was most domesticated.
Miss Payne had used ordinary dolls' heads, but had constructed the bodies herself in such a
way that the dolls could sit and stand, and use their arms to wield a broom or hold the baby.
After some time, one child said, "Mr. Bird ought to go to business," and after much deliberation
he became a grocer. His shop was made and stocked, and he attended it every day, going home
to dinner regularly. One day he appeared to be having a meal on the shop counter, and it was
explained that he had been "rather in a hurry" in the morning, so Mrs. Bird had given him his
breakfast to take with him. The Bird family had various adventures, they had spring cleanings,
removals, visited the Zoo and went to the seaside. One morning a little fellow sat in a trolley
with the Bird family beside him for three-quarters of an hour evidently "imagining." I did
inquire in passing if it was a drive or a picnic, but the answer was so brief, that I knew
I was an interruption and retired. But a younger and bolder inquirer, who wanted to conduct
an experiment in modelling, ventured to ask if Mr. Bird wanted anything that could be made
"at clay modelling." "Yes, he wants some ink-pots for his post-office shop," was the answer,
with the slightly irate addition, "but I wish you'd call it the china factory."

When these children moved to an upper class, Mr. Bird was laid away, but the children requested
his presence. So he entered the new room and became a farmer. He had now to write letters,
to arrange rents, etc., and the money had to be made and counted. The letters served for writing
and reading lessons, and Miss Payne was careful to send the answers through the real post,
properly addressed to Mr. Bird with the name of class and school. Mr. Bird hired labourers,
the children grew corn, and thrashed it and sent it to the mill. A miller had to be produced,
and the children, now his assistants, ground the wheat, and Mr. Bird came in his cart to fetch
the sacks of flour, which ultimately became the Birds' Christmas pudding and was eaten by the
labourers, now guests at the feast. In spring, after careful provision for their comfort, Mr.
Bird went to the cattle market and bought cows. Though the milking had to be pretence, the
butter and cheese were really made.

The first question of the summer term was, "What's Mr. Bird going to do this term?" Like other
teachers inspired by Professor Dewey, we have found our children most responsive to the suggestion
of playing out primitive man. But with some, not of course with the brightest, it is too great
a stretch to go at one step from the present to the most primitive times, and we often spend
a term over something of the nature of Robinson Crusoe, where the situation presents characters
accustomed to modern civilisation and deprived of all its conveniences. Miss Payne is careful
to give the children full opportunity for suggestions--one dull little boy puzzled his mother
by telling her "I made a very good 'gestion' to-day"--so though she had not contemplated the
renewed appearance of Mr. Bird she said, "What do you want him to do?" "Let him go out and
shoot bears," cried an embryo sportsman. Somewhat taken aback, Miss Payne temporised with,
"He wouldn't find them in this country." "Then let him go to India," cried one child, but another
called out, "No, no, let him go to a desert island!" and that was carried with acclamation.
Mr. Bird's various homes were on a miniature scale, and were contained in a series of zinc
trays, which we have had made to fit the available tables and cupboard tops. We find these
trays convenient, as a new one can be added when more scope is required to carry out new ideas.

The following accounts taken from the notes of Miss Hilda Beer, while a student in training,
show another kind of play where the children themselves act the drama. The notes only cover
a short period, but they show how the play may arise quite incidentally.

Mon., June 18.--As the ground is too damp for out-of-doors work, if the children were not ready
with plans, I meant to suggest building a railway station, tunnel, etc., and later, I thought
perhaps we might paint advertisements of seaside resorts for our station.

But the children brought several things with them, and Dorothy brought her own doll. Marie
had left the baby doll from the other room in the cot, so Dorothy and Sylvia said they must
look after the babies. So Cecil, Josie and I swept and dusted.

Then we began to play house. Cecil and Dorothy were Mr. and Mrs. Harry, Sylvia was Mrs. Loo
(husband at the war). Josie was Nurse and I was Aunt Lizzie. The dolls were Winnie Harry, and
Jack and Doreen Loo. Mr. and Mrs. Harry built themselves a house and so did we. Cecil said,
"But what is the name of the road?" Mrs. Harry chose 25 Brookfield Avenue, and Mr. Harry 7
Victoria Street, but he gave in and Mrs. Loo took his name for her house. We had to put numbers
on the houses; Sylvia could make 7, but the others could not make 25, so I put it on the board
and they copied it. Josie having also made a 7 wanted to use it, but Mrs. Loo objected, and
said, "The mother is more important than the nurse," so Josie fixed her 7 on the house opposite.

After lunch we bathed the babies and put them to sleep, and as it was time for the children's
own rest, we all went to bed. When rest was over, we washed and dressed, and then Mrs. Harry
asked for clay to make a water-tap for her house. That made all the children want to make things
in clay, so we made cups and saucers, plates, and a baby's bottle, then scones and sponge-cakes,
bread and a bread-board, and one of the children said we must put a B on that.

Then Mrs. Loo said, "But we haven't any shelves." I had to leave my class in Miss Payne's charge,
and they spent the rest of the time fitting in shelves, water-taps, and sinks.

June 19.--After sweeping, dusting, and washing and dressing the dolls, I read to the children
"How the House was built." Then we all pretended to bake, making rolls and cakes as next day
was to be the doll Winnie's birthday. We baked our cakes on a piece of wood on the empty fireplace.

The other children were invited to Winnie's party, so we went out to shop. The children wanted
lettuces from their own garden, but the grass was too wet, so we pretended. The shop was on
the edge of the grass and we talked to imaginary shopmen, Cecil often exclaiming, "Eightpence!
why, it's not worth it!"

As neither of the houses would hold all the guests invited to the party, we had to have a picnic
instead.

June 20.--I must see that Sylvia and Dorothy do the sweeping to-morrow, and let Josie bath
the doll; she is very good-natured, and I see that they give her the less attractive occupation.
I think too that the food question has played too large a part, so if the children suggest
more cooking I shall look in the larder and say that really we must not buy or bake as food
goes bad in hot weather, and we must not waste in war time.

The children have suggested making cushions, painting pictures, and making knives and forks,
but we have not had time.

Report.--Dorothy and Sylvia swept, Cecil mended the wall of the house, Josie took the children
down to the beach (the sand tray), and I dusted. We looked into the larder and found that yesterday's
greens were going bad, so decided not to buy more. Then we took the babies for a walk. We noticed
how many nasturtiums were out, how the blackberry bushes were in flower and in bud, and the
runner-bean was in flower, and the red flowers looked so pretty in the green leaves. We looked
at the hollyhocks, because I have told the children that they will grow taller than I am, and
they are always wondering how soon this will be. The children found some cherries which had
fallen, and Dorothy said how pretty they were on the tree. I called attention to one branch
that was laden with fruit, and looked particularly pretty with the sun shining on it. We also
looked at the pear tree and the almond. Everything has come on so fast, and the children were
ready to say it was because of the rain.

After rest, we went to the Hall to see the chickens. To-day they were much bigger, and Sylvia
said had "bigger wings." We were able to watch them drinking, how they hold up their heads
to let the water run down. The rest of the morning we made curtains, and the children loved
it. There was much discussion and at first the children suggested making them all different,
but they agreed that curtains at windows were usually alike. Mr. and Mrs. Harry nearly quarrelled,
as one wanted green and the other pink. I suggested trimming the green with a strip of pink,
and they were quite pleased. Mrs. Loo and Nurse chose green which was to be sewn with red silk.
Sylvia said, "A pattern," and I said, "You saw something red and green to-day," and she called
out, "Oh! cherries." She cut out a round of paper and tried to sew round it, holding it in
place with her other hand. I suggested putting in a stitch to hold the paper. Cecil was absorbed
in sewing, and it seemed quieting for such an excitable boy and good for his weak hands. One
child said, "Fancy a boy sewing," so I told how soldiers and sailors sewed. They sewed just
as they liked.

These notes are continued in Chapter IX., where they are used to show children's attitude towards
Nature. Though separated here for a special purpose it is clear that there neither is nor ought
to be any real separation in the lives of the children. Their lives are wholes and they continually
pass from one "subject" to another, because life and its circumstances are making new demands.
If it rains and you cannot gather the lettuces you have grown from seed, you take refuge in
happy pretence; if it clears and the sun calls you out of doors, you take your doll-babies
for their walk.

CHAPTER VII

JOY IN MAKING

     I, too, will something make, and joy in the making.

          ROBERT BRIDGES.

     Built by that only Law, that Use be suggester of Beauty.

          ARTHUR CLOUGH.

There has always been making in the Kindergarten, since to Froebel the impulse to create was
a characteristic of self-conscious humanity. Stopford Brooke points out that Browning's Caliban,
though almost brute, shows himself human, in that, besides thinking out his natural religion,
he also dramatises and creates, "falls to make something."

  'Tis solace making baubles, ay, and sport.
  Tasteth, himself, no finer good i' the world
  Than trying what to do with wit and strength--

What does a child gain from his ceaseless attempts at making? Froebel's answer was that intellectually,
through making he gains ideas, which, received in words, remain mere words. "To learn through
life and action is more developing than to learn through words: expression in plastic material,
united with thought and speech, is far more developing than mere repetition of words." Morally,
it is through impressing himself on his surroundings, that the child reaches the human attributes
of self-consciousness and self-control. One of the most important passages Froebel ever wrote
is this:

"The deepest craving of the child's life is to see itself mirrored in some external object.
Through such reflection, he learns to know his own activity, its essence, direction and aim,
and learns to determine his activity in accordance with outer things. Such mirroring of the
inner life is essential, for through it the child comes to self-consciousness, and learns to
order, determine and master himself."

It is from the point of view of expression alone that Froebel regards Art, and drawing, he
takes to be "the first revelation of the creative power within the child." The very earliest
drawing to which he refers is what he calls "sketching the object on itself," that is, the
tracing round the outlines of things, whereby the child learns form by co-ordinating sight
and motor perceptions, a stage on which Dr. Montessori has also laid much stress. Besides noting
how children draw "round scissors and boxes, leaves and twigs, their own hands, and even shadows,"
he sees that from experimentation with any pointed stick or scrap of red stone or chalk, may
come what Mr. E. Cooke called a language of line, and now "the horse of lines, the man of lines"
will give much pleasure. After this it is true that "whatever a child knows he will put into
his drawing," and the teacher's business is to see that he has abundant perceptions and images
to express.

Another kind of drawing which children seem to find for themselves is what they call making
patterns. Out of this came the old-fashioned chequer drawing, now condemned as injurious to
eyesight and of little value.

When children see anything rich in colour the general cry is "Let's paint it," which is their
way of taking in the beauty. We should not, says Froebel, give them paints and brushes inconsiderately,
to throw about, but give them the help they need, and he describes quite a sensible lesson
given to boys "whose own painting did not seem to paint them long."

Teachers who want real help in the art training of children should read the excellent papers
by Miss Findlay in School and Life, where we are told that we must rescue the term "design"
from the limited uses to which it is often condemned in the drawing class, viz. the construction
of pleasing arrangements of colour and form for surface decoration. "We shall use it in its
full popular significance in constructive work.... The term will cover building houses, making
kettles, laying out streets, planning rooms, dressing hair, as well as making patterns for
cushion covers and cathedral windows.... In thus widening our art studies, we shall be harking
back in a slight degree to the kind of training that in past ages produced the great masters....
Giotto designed his Campanile primarily for the bells that were to summon the Florentines to
their cathedral; the Venetians wanted façades for their palaces, and made façades to delight
their eyes; the Japanese have wanted small furniture for their small rooms, and have developed
wonderful skill and taste in designing it. Neither art nor science can remain long afloat in
high abstract regions above the needs and interests of human life. To quote A.H. Clough:

  'A Cathedral Pure and Perfect.
  Built by that only Law, that Use be suggester of Beauty;
  Nothing concealed that is, done, but all things done to adornment;
  Meanest utilities seized as occasions to grace and embellish.'"

If this is true of the interests of the professional artist, much more must it be true of the
art training of the child. We must not then despise the rough and ready productions of a child,
nor force upon him a standard for which he is not ready.

Before any other construction is possible to him, a child can make with sand, and this is a
constant joy, from the endless puddings that are turned out of patty pans, up to such models
as that of the whole "Isle of Wight" with its tunnelled cliffs and system of railways, made
by an ex-Kindergarten boy as yet innocent of geography lessons.

The child then who is making, especially making for use, is to a certain extent developing
himself as an artist.

The little boys at Keilhau were well provided with sand, moss, etc., to use with their building
blocks, and it was a former Keilhau boy who suggested to his old master that some kind of sand-box
would make a good plaything for the children in his new Kindergarten. Miss Wiggin tells us
that indirectly we owe the children's sand-heaps in the public parks to Froebel, since these
were the result of a suggestion made by Frau Schrader to the Empress Frederick, and the idea
was carried out during her husband's too brief reign.

Another very early "making" is the arranging of furniture for shops, carriages, trains, and
the "ships upon the stairs," which made bright pictures in Stevenson's memory.

Building blocks are truly, as Froebel puts it, "the finest and most variable material that
can be offered a boy for purposes of representation." The little boxes associated with the
Kindergarten were originally planned for the use of nursery children two to three years of
age, and in most if not in all Kindergartens these have been replaced by larger bricks. It
is many years now since, at Miss Payne's suggestion, we bought some hundreds of road paving
blocks, and these are such a source of pleasure that the children often dream about them. Living
out the life around presents much opportunity for making, which may be done with blocks, but
which even in the Kindergarten can be done with tools. Care must be exercised, but children
have quite a strong instinct for self-preservation, and if shown how real workmen handle their
tools, they are often more careful than at a much later stage. To make a workable railway signal
is more interesting and much more educative than to use one that came from a shop. The teacher
may make illuminating discoveries in the process, as when one set of children desired to make
a counter for a shop, and arranged their piece of wood vertically so that the counter had no
top. It was found that to these very little people the most important part was the high front
against which they were accustomed to stand, not the flat top which they seldom saw. Another
set of children made a cart on which the farmer was to carry his corn, and exemplified Dewey's
"concrete logic of action." At first they only wanted a board on wheels, but the corn fell
off, so they nailed on sides, but the cart never had either back or front and resembled some
seen in Early English pictures.

Any kind of cooking that can be done is a most important kind of making; even the very little
ones can help, and they thoroughly enjoy watching. "Her hands were in the dough from three
years old," said a north-country mother, "so I taught her how to bake, and now (at seven) she
can bake as well as I can."

Children delight in carrying out the processes involved in the making of flour, and they can
easily thrash a little wheat, then winnow, grind between stones and sift it. Their best efforts
produce but a tiny quantity of flour, but the experience is real, interest is great, and a
new significance attaches to the shop flour from which bread is ultimately produced.

Butter and cheese can easily be made, also jam, and even a Christmas pudding. In very early
Kindergartens we read of the growing, digging and cooking of potatoes, and of the extraction
of starch to be used as paste.

Special anniversaries require special making. We possess a doll of 1794 to whom her old mother
bequeathed her birthday. The doll's birthday is a great event, and on the previous day each
class in turn bakes tiny loaves, or cakes or pastry for the party.

Christmas creates a need for decorations, Christmas cards and presents, and Empire Day and
Trafalgar Day for flags, while in many places there is an annual sale on behalf of a charity.

It does not do to be too modern and to despise all the old-fashioned "makings," which gave
such pleasure some years ago. Kindergarten Paper-folding has fallen into an undeserved oblivion.
The making of boats or cocked-hats from old newspaper is a great achievement for a child, and
to make pigs and purses, corner cupboards and chairs for paper dolls is still a delight, and
calls forth real concentration and effort.

Making in connection with some whole, such as the continuous representation of life around
us, and, at a later stage, the re-inventing of primitive industries, or making which arises
out of some special interest may have a higher educational value, but apart from this, children
want to make for making's sake. "Can't I make something in wood like Boy does?" asked a little
girl. There is joy in the making, joy in being a cause, and for this the children need opportunity,
space and time. There is a lesson to many of us in some verses by Miss F. Sharpley, lately
published (Educational Handwork), which should be entitled, "When can I make my little Ship?"

  I'd like to cut, and cut, and cut,
   And over the bare floor
  To strew my papers all about,
    And then to cut some more.

  I'd sweep them up so neatly, too,
    But mother says, "Oh no!
  There is no time, it's seven o'clock;
    To bed you quickly go!"

  In school, I'd just begun to make
    A pretty little ship,
  But I was slow, and all the rest
    Stood up to dance and skip.

  When shall I make my little ship?
    At home there is no gloy,
  And father builds it by himself
    Or goes to buy a toy.

CHAPTER VIII

STORIES

     Let me tell the stories and I care not who makes the textbooks.

          STANLEY HALL.

"Is it Bible story to-day or any kind of a story?" was the greeting of an eager child one morning.
"Usually they were persuading him to tell stories," writes Ebers, from his recollections of
Froebel as an old man at Keilhau.

So Froebel could write with feeling of "the joyful faces, the sparkling eyes, the merry shouts
that welcome the genuine story-teller"; he had a right to pronounce that "the child's desire
and craving for tales, for legends, for all kinds of stories, and later on for historical accounts,
is very intense."

Surely there was never a little one who did not crave for stories, though here and there may
be found an older child, who got none at the right time, and who, therefore, lost that most
healthy of appetites. Most of us will agree that there is something wrong with the child who
does not like stories, but it may be that the something wrong belonged to the mother. One such
said to the Abbé Klein one day, "My children have never asked for stories." "But, madame,"
was the reply, "neither would they ask for cake if they had never eaten it, or even seen it."

It is easy for us to find reasons why we should tell stories. We can brush aside minor aims
such as increasing the child's vocabulary. Undoubtedly his vocabulary does increase enormously
from listening to stories, but it is difficult to imagine that any one could rise to real heights
in story-telling with this as an aim or end. That the narrator should clothe his living story
in words expressive of its atmosphere, and that the listener should in this way gain such power
over language, that he, too, can fitly express himself is quite another matter.

First, then, we tell stories because we love to tell them and because the children love to
listen. We choose stories that appeal to our audience. It is something beautiful, humorous,
heroic or witty that we have found, and being social animals we want to share it. As educators
with an aim before us, we deliberately tell stories in order to place before our children ideals
of unselfishness, courage and truth. We know from our own experience, not only in childhood,
but all through life how the story reaches our feelings as no sermon or moralising ever does,
and we have learned that "out of the heart are the issues of life." Unguided feelings may be
a danger, but the story does more than rouse feelings--it gives opportunity for the exercise
of moral judgement, for the exercise of judgement upon questions of right and wrong. Feeling
is aroused, but it is not usually a personal feeling, so judgement is likely to be unbiassed.
It may, however, be biassed by the tone absorbed from the environment even in childhood, as
when the mother makes more of table etiquette than of kindness, and the child, instead of condemning
Jacob's refusal to feed his hungry brother with the red pottage, as all natural children do
condemn, says: "No, Esau shouldn't have got it, 'cause he asked for it."

As a rule, the children's standard is correct enough, and approval or condemnation is justly
bestowed, provided that the story has been chosen to suit the child's stage of development.
One little girl objected strongly to Macaulay's ideal Roman, who "in Rome's quarrel, spared
neither land nor gold, nor son nor wife." "That wasn't right," she said stoutly, "he ought
to think of his own wife and children first." She was satisfied, however, when it was explained
to her that Horatius might be able to save many fathers to many wives and children. In my earliest
teaching days, having found certain history stories successful with children of seven, I tried
the same with children of six, but only once. Edmund of East Anglia dying for his faith fell
very flat. "What was the good of that?" said one little fellow, "'cause if you're dead you
can't do anything! But if you're alive, you can get more soldiers and win a victory." The majority
of the class, however, seemed to feel with another who asked, "Why didn't he promise while
the Danes were there? He needn't have kept it when they went away."

Another way of stating our aim in telling stories to children is that a story presents morality
in the concrete. Virtues and vices per se neither attract nor repel, they simply mean nothing
to a child, until they are presented as the deeds of man or woman, boy or girl, living and
acting in a world recognised as real. One telling story is that of the boy who got hold of
Miss Edgeworth's Parent's Assistant and who said to his mother, "Mother, I've been reading
'The Little Merchants' and I know now how horrid it is to cheat and tell lies." "I have been
telling you that ever since you could speak," said his mother, to which the boy answered, "Yes,
I know, but that didn't interest me." Our children had been told the story of how the Countess
of Buchan crowned the Bruce, a duty which should have been performed by her brother the Earl
of Fife, who, however, was too much afraid of the wrath of English Edward. A few days after,
an argument arose and one little girl was heard to say, "I don't want to be brave," and a boy
rejoined, "Girls don't need to be brave." I said, "Which would you rather be, the Countess
who put the crown on the King's head, or the brother who ran away?" And quickly came the answer,
"Oh! the brave Countess," from the very child who didn't want to be brave!

Froebel sums up the teacher's aim in the words: "The telling of stories is a truly strengthening
spirit-bath, it gives opportunity for the exercise of all mental powers, opportunity for testing
individual judgement and individual feelings."

But why is it that children crave for stories? "Education," says Miss Blow, a veteran Froebelian,
"is a series of responses to indicated needs," and undoubtedly the need for stories is as pressing
as the need to explore, to experiment and to construct. What is the unconscious need that is
expressed in this craving, why is this desire so deeply implanted by Nature? So far, no one
seems to have given a better answer than Froebel has done, when he says that the desire for
stories comes out of the need to understand life, that it is in fact rooted in the instinct
of investigation. "Only the study of the life of others can furnish points of comparison with
the life the boy himself has experienced. The story concerns other men, other circumstances,
other times and places, yet the hearer seeks his own image, he beholds it and no one knows
that he sees it."

Man cannot be master of his surroundings till he investigates and so gathers knowledge. But
he has to adapt himself not only to the physical but to the human environment in which he lives.
In stories of all kinds, children study human life in all kinds of circumstances, nay, if the
story is sufficiently graphic they almost go through the experiences narrated, almost live
the new life.

With very young children the most popular of all stories is the "The Three Bears" and it is
worth a little analysis. A little girl runs away, and running away is a great temptation to
little girls and boys, as great an adventure as running off to sea will be at a later stage.
She goes into a wood and meets bears: what else could you expect! The story then deals with
really interesting things, porridge, basins, chairs and beds. The strong contrast of the bears'
voices fascinates children, and just when retribution might descend upon her, the heroine escapes
and gets safe home. Children revel in the familiar details, but these alone would not suffice,
there must be adventure, excitement, romance. One feels that Southey had the assistance of
a child in making his story so complete, and we can hear the questions: "How did the big bear
know that the little girl had tasted his porridge? Oh, because she had left the spoon. How
did he know that she had sat in his chair? Because she left the cushion untidy, and as for
the little bear's chair, why, she sat that right out."

That quite little children desire fresh experiences or adventures and really exciting ones,
is shown by the following stories made by children. The first two are by a little girl of two-and-a-half,
the third is taken from Lady Glenconner's recently published The Sayings of the Children.

"Once upon a time there was a giant and a little girl, and he told a little girl not to kiss
a bear acos he would bite her, and the little girl climbed right on his back and she jumped
right down the stairs and the bear came walking after the little girl and kissing her, and
she called it a little bear and it was a big bear! (immense amusement).

"Once upon a time there was a little piggy and he was right in a big green and white fire and
he didn't hurt hisself, and (told as a tremendous secret) he touched a fire with his handie.
'What a naughty piggy,' said Auntie, 'and what next?' He jumped right out of a fire. Auntie,
can you smile? (For aunties cannot smile when people are naughty.)"

The third story is said to have been filled with pauses due to a certain slowness of speech,
but the pauses are "lit by the lightning flash of a flying eyebrow, and the impressive nodding
of a silken head."

"Once, you know, there was a fight between a little pony and a lion, and the lion sprang against
the pony and the pony put his back against a stack and bited towards the lion, and the lion
rolled over and the pony jumped up, and he ran up ... and the pony turned round and the lion ..."

His mother felt she had lost the thread. "Which won?" she asked. "Which won!" he repeated and
after a moment's pause he said, "Oh! the little bear."

This surprising conclusion points to a stage when it is difficult for a child to hold the thread
of a narrative, and at this stage, along with simple stories of little ones like themselves,
repetition or "accumulation" stories seem to give most pleasure. "Henny Penny" and "Billy Bobtail"--told
by Jacobs as "How Jack went to seek his Fortune"--are prime favourites.

Very soon, however, the children are ready for the time-honoured fairy-tale or folk-tale.

The orthodox beginning, "Once upon a time, in a certain country there lived ...," fits the
stage when neither time nor place is of any consequence. Animals speak, well why not, we can!
The fairies accomplish wonders, again why not? Wonderful things do happen and they must have
a wonderful cause, and, as one child said, if there never had been any fairies, how could people
have written stories about them? Goodness is rewarded and wickedness is punished, as is only
right in the child's eyes, and goodness usually means kindness, the virtue best understood
of children. Obedience is no doubt the nursery virtue in the eyes of authority, but kindness
is much more human and attractive.

"Both child and man," says Froebel, "desire to know the significance of what happens around
them; this is the foundation of Greek choruses, especially in tragedy, and of many productions
in the realm of legends and fairy-tales. It is the result of the deep-rooted consciousness,
the slumbering premonition of being surrounded by that which is higher and more conscious than
ourselves." The fairy tale is the child's mystery land, his recognition that there are more
things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy or in our science. Dr. Montessori
protests against the idea that fairy-tales have anything to do with the religious sense, saying
that "faith and fable are as the poles apart." She does not understand that it is for their
truth that we value fairy-tales. The truths they teach are such as that courage and intelligence
can conquer brute strength, that love can brave and can overcome all dangers and always finds
the lost, that kindness begets kindness and always wins in the end. The good and the faithful
marries the princess--or the prince--and lives happy ever after. And assuredly if he does not
marry his princess, he will not live happy, and if she does not marry the prince, she will
live in no beautiful palace. And there is more. Take for instance, the story of "Toads and
Diamonds." The courteous maiden who goes down the well, who gives help where it is needed,
and who works faithfully for Mother Holle,[21] comes home again dropping gold and diamonds
when she speaks. Her silence may be silver, but her speech is golden, and her words give light
in dark places. The selfish and lazy girl, who refuses help and whose work is unfaithful and
only done for reward, has her reward. Henceforth, when she speaks, down fall toads and snakes
her words are cold as she is, they may glitter but they sting.

[Footnote 21: This version is probably a mixture of the versions of Perrault and Grimm but
Mother Holle shaking her feathers is worth bringing in.]

Fairy- and folk-tales give wholesome food to the desire for adventure, whereas in what we may
call realistic stories, adventure is chiefly confined to the naughty child, who is therefore
more attractive than the good and stodgy. Even among fairy-tales we may select. "Beauty and
the Beast" and "The Sleeping Beauty" and "Snow-white and Rose-red" are distinctly preferable
to "Jack the Giant Killer" or "Puss in Boots," while "Bluebeard" cannot be told. It seems to
me that children can often safely read for themselves stories the adult cannot well tell. The
child's notion of justice is crude, bad is bad, and whether embodied in an ogre or in Pharaoh
of Egypt, it must be got rid of, put out of the story. No child is sorry for the giant when
Jack's axe cleaves the beanstalk, and as for Pharaoh, "Well, it's a good thing he's drowned,
for he was a bad man, wasn't he?" Death means nothing to children, as a rule, except disappearance.
When children can read for themselves, they will take from their stories what suits their stage
of development, their standard of judgement, and we need not interfere, even though they regard
with perfect calm what seems gruesome to the adult.

As a valuable addition to the best-known fairy-tales, we may mention one or two others: Grannie's
Wonderful Chair is a delightful set of stories, full of charming pictures, though the writer,
Frances Brown, was born blind. Mrs. Ewing's stories for children, The Brownies, with Amelia
and the Dwarfs and Timothy's Shoes, are inimitable, and her Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales are very
good, but not for very young children. Her other stories are certainly about children, but
are, as a rule, written for adults.

George Macdonald's stories are all too well known and too universally beloved to need recommendation.
But in telling them, e.g. "The Princess and the Goblins" or "At the Back of the North Wind,"
the young teacher must remember that they are beautiful allegories. Before she ventures to
tell them, the beginner should ponder well what the poet--for these are prose poems--means,
and who is represented by the beautiful Great-great-grandmother always old and always young,
or "North Wind" who must sink the ship but is able to bear the cry from it, because of the
sound of a far-off song, which seems to swallow up all fear and pain and to set the suffering
"singing it with the rest."

Water-Babies is a bridge between the fairy-tale of a child and equally wonderful and beautiful
fairy-tales of Nature, and it, too, is full of meaning. If the teacher has gained this, the
children will not lag behind. It was a child of backward development, who, when she heard of
Mother Carey, "who made things make themselves," said, "Oh! I know who that was, that was God."

Such stories must be spread out over many days of telling, but they gain rather than lose from
that, though for quite young children the stories do require to be short and simple, and often
repeated. If children get plenty of these, the stage for longer stories is reached wonderfully
soon.

Pseudo-scientific stories, in which, for example, a drop of water discusses evaporation and
condensation, are not stories at all, but a kind of mental meat lozenge, most unsatisfying
and probably not even fulfilling their task of supplying nourishment in form of facts. Fables
usually deal with the faults and failings of grown-ups, and may be left for children to read
for themselves, to extract what suits them.

Illustrations are not always necessary, but if well chosen they are always a help. Warne has
published some delightfully illustrated stories for little children, "The Three Pigs," "Hop
o' my Thumb," "Beauty and the Beast," etc. They are illustrated by H.M. Brock and by Leslie
Brooke, and they really are illustrated. The artists have enjoyed the stories and children
equally enjoy the pictures.

The teacher must consider what ideas she is presenting and whether words alone can convey them
properly. We must remember that most children visualise and that they can only do so from what
they have seen. So, without illustrations, a castle may be a suburban house with Nottingham
lace curtains and an aspidistra, while Perseus or Moses may differ little from the child's
own father or brothers. Again, town children cannot visualise hill and valley, forest and moor,
brook and river, not to mention jungles and snowfields and the trackless ocean. It is not easy
to find pictures to give any idea of such scenes, but it is worth while to look for them, and
it is also worth while for the teacher to visualise, and to practise vivid describing of what
she sees. Children, of course, only want description when it is really a part of the story,
as when Tom crosses the moor, descends Lewthwaite Crag, or travels from brook to river and
from river to sea.

As to how a story should be told, opinions differ. It must be well told with a well-modulated
voice and with slight but effective gesture. But the model should be the story as told in the
home, not the story told from a platform. The children need not be spellbound all the time,
but should be free to ask sensible questions and to make childlike comments in moderation.
The language should fit the subject; beautiful thoughts need beauty of expression, high and
noble deeds must be told in noble language. A teacher who wishes to be a really good teller
of stories must herself read good literature, and she will do well not only to prepare her
stories with care, but to consider the language she uses in daily life. There is a happy medium
between pedantry and the latest variety of slang, and if daily speech is careless and slipshod,
it is difficult to change it for special occasions. Our stories should not only prepare for
literature, they should be literature, and those who realise what the story may do for children
will not grudge time spent in preparation. If the story is to present an ideal, let us see
that we present a worthy one; if it is to lead the children to judge of right and wrong, let
us see that we give them time and opportunity to judge and that we do not force their judgement.

CHAPTER IX

IN GRASSY PLACES

     My heart leaps up when I behold
       A rainbow in the sky,
     So was it when my life began
     So be it when I shall grow old,
       Or let me die.

What is the real aim of what we call Nature-lessons, Nature-teaching, Nature-work? It is surely
to foster delight in beauty, so that our hearts shall leap up at sight of the rainbow until
we die. For, indeed, if we lose that uplift of the heart, some part of us has died already.
Yet even Wordsworth mourns that nothing can bring back the hour of splendour in the grass and
glory in the flower!

In its answer to the question "What is the chief end of man?" the old Shorter Catechism has
a grand beginning: "Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever." Do we lose
the vision because we are not bold enough to take that enjoyment as our chief end? To enjoy
good is to enjoy God.

Our ends or aims are our desires, and Mr. Clutton Brock, in his Ultimate Belief, urges teachers
to recognise that the spirit of man has three desires, three ends, and that it cannot be satisfied
till it attains all three. Man desires to do right, so far as he sees it, for the sake of doing
right; he desires to gain knowledge or to know for the sake of knowing, for the sake of truth;
and he desires beauty.

"We do not value that which we call beautiful because it is true, or because it is good, but
because it is beautiful. There is a glory of the universe which we call truth which we discover
and apprehend, and a glory of the universe which we call beauty and which we discover or apprehend."

Froebel begins his Education of Man by an inquiry into the reason for our existence and his
answer is that all things exist to make manifest the spirit, the élan vital, which brought
them into being.

And Browning? "If you get simple beauty and nought else, you get about the best thing God invents."

To let children get that beauty should be our aim, and they must get it in their own way. "Life
in and with Nature and with the fair silent things of Nature, should be fostered by parents
and others," Froebel tells us, "as a chief fulcrum of child-life, and this is accomplished
chiefly in play, which is at first simply natural life."

Let us surmount the ruts of our teaching experience and climb high enough to look back upon
our own childhood, to see where beauty called to us, where we attained to beauty.

Among my own earliest recollections come a first view of the starry sky and the discovery of
Heaven. No one called attention to the stars, they spoke themselves to a child of four or five
and declared "the glory of God." Heaven was not on high among these glorious stars, however.
It was a grassy place with flowers and sunshine. It had to be Heaven because you went through
the cemetery to reach it, and because it was so bright and flowery and there were no graves
in it. I never found it again, because I had forgotten how to get there.

Another very early memory is one of grief, to see from the window how the gardener was mowing
down all the daisies, and there were so many, in the grass; and yet another is of a high, grassy,
sunny field with a little stream running far down below. It was not really far and there was
nothing particularly beautiful in the place to grown-up eyes, but the beholder was very small
and loved it dearly. To his Art and Blue Heaven Stevenson might have added Sun and Green Grass.
For he knew what grassy places are to the child, and that "happy play in grassy places" might
well be Heaven to the little one.

A most interesting little book called What is a Kindergarten?[22] was published some years
ago in America. It is written by a landscape gardener, and contains most valuable suggestions
as to how best to use for a Kindergarten or Nursery School plots of ground which may be secured
for that purpose. Naturally the writer has much to say on the laying out and stocking the available
space to the best advantage, choosing the most suitable positions for the house, where the
teacher must live, he says, to supply the atmosphere of a home; for animal hutches, for sand-heaps
and seesaws; for the necessary shelter, for the children's gardens, and for the lawn, for even
on his smallest plan, a "twenty-five-foot lot," we find "room for a spot of green." Later he
explains that for this green one must use what will grow, and if grass will not perhaps clover
will. The way in which the trees and plants are chosen is most suggestive. Beauty and suitability
are always considered, but he remembers his own youth, and also considers the special joys
of childhood. For it is not Nature lessons that come into his calculations but "the mere association
of plants and children." So the birch tree is chosen, partly for its grace and beauty, but
also because of its bark, for one can scribble on its papery surface; the hazel, because children
delight in the catkins with their showers of golden dust, and the nut "hidden in its cap of
frills and tucks." And he adds: "How much more alluring than the naked fruit from the grocer's
sack are these nuts, especially when dots for eyes and mouth are added, and a whole little
face is tucked within this natural bonnet."

[Footnote 22: G. Hansen, pub. Elder, Morgan & Shepherd, San Francisco, 1891.]

In addition to the flowers chosen for beauty of colour, this lover of children and of gardens
wants Canterbury Bells to ring, Forget-me-nots because they can stand so much watering, and
"flowers with faces," pansies, sweet-peas, lupins, snapdragons, monkey flowers, red and white
dead nettles, and red clover to bring the bees. Some of these are chosen because the child
can do something with them, can find their own uses for them, can play with them. And, speaking
generally, playing with them is the child's way of appreciating both plant and animal. Picking
feathery grasses, red-tipped daisies, sweet-smelling clover and golden dandelions; feeding
snapdragons with fallen petals, finding what's o'clock by blowing dandelion fruits, paying
for dock tea out of a fairy purse, shading poppy dolls with woodruff parasols, that is how
a child enjoys the beauty of colour, scent and form. He gets not more but less beauty when
he must sit in a class and answer formal questions. "Must we talk about them before we take
the flowers home?" asked a child one day; "they are so pretty." Clearly, the "talk" was going
to lessen, not to deepen the beauty. And animals? The child plays with cat and dog, he feeds
the chickens, the horse and the donkey, he watches with the utmost interest caterpillar, snail
and spider, but he does not want to be asked questions about them--he does want to talk and
perhaps to ask the questions himself--nor does he always want even to draw, paint or model
them. Mostly he wants to watch, and perhaps just to stir them up a little if they do not perform
to his satisfaction. He does not necessarily mean to tease, only why should he watch an animal
that does nothing? "The animals haven't any habits when I watch them," a little girl once said
to Professor Arthur Thomson.

All children should live in the country at least for part of the year. They should know fields
and gardens, and have intercourse with hens and chickens, cows and calves, sheep and lambs;
should make hay and see the corn cut. They would still want the wisely sympathetic teacher,
not to arouse interest--that is not necessary, but to keep it alive by keeping pace with the
child's natural development. It is not merely living in the country that develops the little
child's interest in shape and colour and scent into something deeper. People still "spend all
their time in the fields and forests and see and feel nothing of the beauties of Nature, and
of their influence on the human heart"; and this, said Froebel--and it is just what Mr. Clutton
Brock is saying now--is because the child "fails to find the same feelings among adults." Two
effects follow: the child feels the want of sympathy and loses some respect for the elder,
and also he loses his original joy in Nature.

"There is in every human being the passionate desire for this self-forgetfulness--to which
it attains when it is aware of beauty--and a passionate delight in it when it comes. The child
feels that delight among spring flowers; we can all remember how we felt it in the first apprehension
of some new beauty of the universe, when we ceased to be little animals and became aware that
there was this beauty outside us to be loved. And most of us must remember, too, the strange
indifference of our elders. They were not considering the lilies of the field; they did not
want us to get our feet wet among them. We might be forgetting ourselves, but they were remembering
us; and we became suddenly aware of the bitterness of life and the tyranny of facts. Now parents
and nurses (and teachers) have, of course, to remember children when they forget themselves.
But they ought to be aware that the child, when he forgets himself in the beauty of the world,
is passing through a sacred experience which will enrich and glorify the whole of his life.
Children, because they are not engaged in the struggle for life, are more capable of this aesthetic
self-forgetfulness than they will afterwards be; and they need all of it that they can get,
so that they may remember it and prize it in later years. In these heaven-sent moments they
know what disinterestedness is. They have a test by which they can value all future experience
and know the dullness and staleness of worldly success. Therefore it is a sin to check, more
than need be, their aesthetic delight" (The Ultimate Belief).

We cannot all give to our children the experiences we should like to supply, but if we are
clear that we are aiming at enjoyment of Nature, and not at supplying information, we shall
come nearer to what is desirable. For years, almost since it opened in 1908, Miss Reed of the
Michaelis Free Kindergarten has taken her children to the country. It means a great deal of
work and responsibility, it means collecting funds and giving up one's scanty leisure, it means
devoted service, but it has been done, and it has been kept up even during war time, though
with great difficulty as to funds, because of the inestimable benefit to the children. Miss
Stokes of the Somers Town Nursery School secured a country holiday for her little ones in various
ways, partly through the Children's Country Holiday Fund, but since the war she has been unable
to secure help of that kind, and has managed to take the children away to a country cottage.
A paragraph in the report says: "The children in the country had a delightful time, and what
was seen and done during their holiday is still talked about continually. These joys entered
into all the work of the nursery school and helped the children for months to retain a breath
of the country in their London surroundings. They realised much from that visit. Cows now have
horns, wasps have wings and fly--alas they sting also. Hens sit on eggs, an almost unbelievable
thing. Fishes, newts, tadpoles, were all met with and greeted as friends. Children and helpers
alike returned home full of health and vigour and longing for the next time. One little maid
wept bitterly, and there seemed no joy in life at home until she came across the school rabbit,
which was tenderly caressed, and consoled her with memories of the country and hopes for future
visits."

In the days when teachers argued about the differences between Object-lessons and Nature-lessons,
one point insisted upon was that the Nature-lesson far surpassed the Object-lesson because
it dealt with life.

We have learned now that we should as much as we can surround our children with life and growth.
Even indoors it is easy to give the joy of growing seeds and bulbs and of opening chestnut
branches: without any cruelty we can let them enjoy watching snails and worms and we can keep
caterpillars or silkworms and so let them drink their fill of the miracle of development. But
beauty comes to children in very different ways, and always it is Nature, though it may not
be life.

Children revel in colour, colour for its own sake, and should be allowed to create it. In a
modern novel there is a description of a mother doing her washing in the open air and "at her
feet sat a baby intent upon the assimilation of a gingerbread elephant, but now and then tugging
at her skirts and holding up a fat hand. Each time he was rewarded by a dab of soapsuds, which
she deposited good-naturedly in his palm. He received it with solemn delight; watching the
roseate play of colour as the bubbles shrank and broke, and the lovely iridescent treasure
vanished in a smear of dirty wetness while he looked. Then he would beat his fists delightedly
against his mother's dress and presently demand another handful."

The following notes from another student's report show how this may spring naturally out of
the children's life:[23]

[Footnote 23: Miss Edith Jones.]

"We were spinning the teetotum yesterday and it did not spin well so we made new ones. While
the children were painting their tops, Oliver grew very eager when he found he could fill in
all the spaces in different colours, but Betty made her colours very insipid. I want them to
get the feeling of beautiful colour, so I shall show them a book with the colours graded in
it, and we shall each have a paper and paint on it all the rich colours we can think of. The
colours will probably run into each other, and so the children will get ideas about the blending
of colours, but I will watch to see that they do not get the colour too wet. If they are not
tired of painting I want to show them a painted circle to turn on a string and they can make
these for themselves, using the colours they have already used.

"I want the children to do some group work, and I thought we might make a village with shops
and houses under the trees in the garden and have little men and women to represent ourselves.
The suggestion will probably have to come from the teacher, but the children will probably
have the desire when it is suggested, and I hope we shall be able to go on enlarging our town
on the pattern of the towns the children know. If they want bricks for their houses they can
dig clay in the garden.

"Report.--The children wanted to make a tea-set, so we carried our clay outside. They began
discussing why their china would not be so fine as the china at home, and I said the clay might
be different. Then Bernard asked what sort of china we should get from the clay in the garden,
and I told him that kind of clay was generally made into bricks, and suggested making bricks.
From that we went on to the use of bricks, and to-morrow we are going to dig, and make bricks
to build a town. Bernard is anxious to know how we shall make mortar. Just then it started
to rain, and Bernard said that if the sun kept shining and it rained hard enough we should
have a rainbow, and he wished it would come so as to see the beautiful colours. I thought this
rather a coincidence, and told him I had a book with all the rainbow colours in it. They asked
to see it, so I showed it and suggested painting the colours ourselves. Those who had finished
their dishes started, and we talked about the richness of the colours. One or two children
started with very watery colour, so I showed them the book and began to paint myself. They
all enjoyed it very much, especially the different colours made where the colours ran into
each other. The results pleased them and they are to be used as wall-papers to sell in our
town, but Sybil wants to have a toy shop, and she is going to make a painted circle for it
like the one I showed."

This is clearly the time to show a glass prism and to let these children make rainbows for
themselves, to tell the story of Iris, and to use any colour material, Milton Bradley spectrum
papers, Montessori silks, colour top, and anything else so long as the children keep up their
interest. The interest in colour need never die out; it will probably show itself now in finer
discrimination, and more careful reproduction of the colours of flowers and leaves, and the
sympathy given will heighten interest and increase enjoyment.

Here are some notes showing children's numerous activities in a suburban garden where they
were allowed to visit a hen and chickens.

"Monday[24]--To-day the children took up their mustard and cress, dug and raked the ground
ready for transplanting the lettuces. After their rest we went to see the chickens at the Hall
(the Students' Hostel), and the Hall garden seemed to them a wonderful place. They watched
the trains go in and out of the station at the foot of the garden, and explored all the side
doors, going up and down all the steps and into the cycle shed. They helped Miss S. to stir
the soot water, then they went to the grassy bank and ran down it, slid down it, and rolled
down it. They peeped over the wall into the next garden, they peeped through holes in the fences
and finished up with a swing in the hammock. Each child had twenty swings, and they enjoyed
counting in time with the swaying of the hammock, and swayed their own bodies as they pushed.

[Footnote 24: These notes are part of those already given on pp. 68-71.]

"Another example of love and rhythm was when they went to say good-bye to the hen and chickens,
and kept on repeating 'Good-bye, good-bye' all together, nodding their heads at the same time.

"I did not know if I should have let them do so much, but I was not sure that we should be
allowed to come back and I wanted them to enjoy the garden.

"Wednesday.--First we watered the lettuces we had transplanted, and transplanted more. Then,
as we had permission to come again, we took some of our lettuces to the chickens. We saw the
mother hen with one wing spread right out, and the children were much surprised to see how
large it was. We looked at the roses, and saw how the bud of yesterday was full blown to-day.
The children again ran down and rolled down the bank, and had turns in the hammock, this time
to the rhythm of "Margery Daw" sung twice through, and then counting up to twenty. Very often
they went to watch the trains. Cecil is particularly interested in them, and wanted to know
how long was the time between. He said three minutes, I guessed nine, but we found they were
irregular. In the intervals while waiting for a train to pass, we played a 'listening' game,
listening to what sounds we could hear. A thrush came and sang right over our heads, so the
listening was concentrated on his song, and we tried to say what we thought he meant to say.
One child said, 'He says, "Come here, come here,"' but they found this too difficult. We also
watched a boy cleaning the station windows, and Dorothy said, 'Miss Beer, isn't it wonderful
that you can see through glass?' I agreed, but made no other remark because I did not know
what to say.

"We rested outside to-day under an almond tree. I pointed out how pretty the sky looked when
you only saw it peeping through the leaves. After rest the children noticed feathery grasses,
and spent the rest of the morning gathering them. I suggested that they should see how many
kinds they could find. They found three, but were not enthusiastic about it, being content
just to pluck, but they were delighted when they found specially long and beautiful grasses
hidden deep under a leafy bush. They also found clover leaves, and I told them its name and
sang to them the verse from 'The Bee,' with 'The sweet-smelling clover, he, humming, hangs over.'

"Thursday.--Brushed and dusted the room, gave fresh water to the flowers, and then went to
gardening. The children were delighted to find ladybirds on the lettuces they were transplanting,
and we also noticed how the cherries were ripening.

"They joined the Transition Class for games. Later, while playing with the sand, Cecil made
a discovery. He said, 'Miss Beer, do you know, I know what sand is, it's little tiny tiny stones.'"

It may be worth while to notice some things in these notes. First the pleasure in exploring
the new surroundings and then the variety of delights. Our landscape gardener mentions that
"any slope to our grounds should be welcomed.... For as we leave the level land and flee to
the mountains to spend our vacation, so will a child avoid the street and seek the gutter and
the bank on the unimproved lot to enjoy its pastime." Our own children have been fortunate
enough to have a bank for their play, and though, unfortunately, extension of buildings has
taken away much of this, we have had abundant opportunity to see the value of sloping ground.
Then there are the discoveries, the feathery grasses, especially those which were hidden, the
ladybirds, that sand is really "tiny tiny stones"--has every adult noticed that, or is sand
"just sand"?--and the "wonder" that we can see through glass, a wonder realised by a little
girl of four years old. Also we can notice what the children did not desire. They liked listening
to the thrush, but to make out what the thrush was "saying" was beyond them. They liked gathering
feathery grasses, but to sort these into different kinds gave no pleasure, though older children
would have enjoyed trying to find many varieties.

Perhaps teachers with a fair amount of experience might have felt like the beginner who frankly
says, "I didn't say anything more because I didn't know what to say," when Dorothy discovered
the wonderfulness of glass. Perhaps we are silent because the child has gone ahead of us. It
is wonderful, but we have never thought about it. In such cases we must, as Froebel says, "become
a learner with the child" and humbly, with real sympathy and earnestness, ask, "Is it wonderful,
I suppose it is, but I never thought about it, why do you call it wonderful?" If the child
answers, it is well, if not the teacher can go on thinking aloud, thinking with the child.
"Let's think what other things we can see through." We can never understand it, we can only
reach the fact of "transparency" as a wonderful property of certain substances and consider
which possess this magic quality. There is water of course, and there is jelly or gelatine,
but these are not hard, they are not stones as glass seems to be. The child will be pleased
too to see a crystal or a bit of mica, but the main thing is that we should not imagine we
have disposed of the wonder by a mere name with a glib, "Oh, that's just because it's transparent,"
but that we realise, and reinforce and deepen the child's sense of wonderfulness. So teacher
and child enter into the thoughts of Him

    Who endlessly was teaching
  Above my spirits utmost reaching,
  What love can do in the leaf or stone,
  So that to master this alone,
  This done in the stone or leaf for me,
  I must go on learning endlessly.

CHAPTER X

A WAY TO GOD

     Wonders chiefly at himself
     Who can tell him what he is
     Or how meet in human elf
     Coming and past eternities.

    EMERSON.

It is of set purpose that this short chapter, referring to what we specially call religion,
is placed immediately after that on the child's attitude to Nature. The actual word religion,
which, to him, expressed being bound, did not appeal to Froebel so much as one which expressed
One-ness with God.

But we begin at earth's level, and a child's religion must be largely a natural religion.

How to introduce a child to religion is a problem which must have many solutions. In Froebel's
original training course, his Kindergarten teachers were to be "trained to the observation
and care of the earliest germs of the religious instinct in man." These earliest beginnings
he found in different sources. First come the relations between the child and the family, beginning
with the mother; fatherhood and motherhood must be realised before the child can reach up to
the Father of all. Then there is the atmosphere of the home, the real reverence for higher
things, if it exists, affects even a little child more than is usually supposed, but children
are quick to distinguish reality from mere conventionality though the distinction is only half
conscious. Reality impresses, while conventionality is apt to bore. Even to quite young children
Froebel's ideal mother would begin to show God in nature. Some one put into the flowers the
scent and colour that delight the child--some one whom he cannot see. The sun, moon and stars
give light and beauty, and "love is what they mean to show." This mother teaches her little
one some sort of prayer, and the gesture of reverence, the folded hands, affects the child
even if the words mean little or nothing. Akin to the "feeling of community" between the child
and his family is the joining in religious worship in church, "the entrance in a common life,"
and the emotional effect of the deep tones of the organ. Then there is the interdependence
of the universe: the baby is to thank Jenny for his bread and milk, Peter for mowing the grass
for the cow, "until you come to the last ring of all, God's father love for all." Next to this
comes the child's service; others work for him and he also must serve. "Every age has its duties,
and duties are not burdens," and it is necessary that feeling should have expression, "for
even a child's love unfostered (by action in form of service) droops and dies away." There
is also the desire for approbation. The child "must be roused to good by inclination, love,
and respect, through the opinion of others about him," and this should be guided until he learns
to care chiefly for the approval of the God within. Right ideals must be provided: religion
is "a continually advancing endeavour," and its reward must not be a material reward. We ought
to lift and strengthen human nature, but we degrade and weaken it when we seek to lead it to
good conduct by a bait, even if this bait beckons to a future world. The consciousness of having
lived worthily should be our highest reward. Froebel goes so far as to say that instead of
teaching "the good will be happy," and leaving children to imagine that this means an outer
or material happiness, we ought rather to teach that in seeking the highest we may lose the
lower. "Renunciation, the abandonment of the outer for the sake of securing the inner, is the
condition for attaining highest development. Dogmatic religious instruction should rather show
that whoever truly and earnestly seeks the good, must needs expose himself to a life of outer
oppression, pain and want, anxiety and care." Even a child, though not a baby, can be led to
see that to do good for outer reward is but enlightened selfishness.

These suggestions are taken for the most part from the Mother Songs, some from The Education
of Man. Each parent or teacher must use what seems to her or to him most valuable. Some may
from the beginning desire to teach the child a baby prayer, or at least to let him hear "God
bless you." Others may prefer to wait for a more intelligent stage, perhaps when the child
begins to ask the invariable questions--who made the flowers, the animals; who made me? If
so, we must remember that children see, and hear, and think, that often in thoughtless ejaculations,
or in those of heartfelt thankfulness, children may hear the name of God; that a simple story
may have something that stirs thought; that churches are much in evidence; and that the conversation
of little playfellows may take an unexpected turn.

To me it seems a great mistake to put before young children ideas which are really beyond the
conception of an adult. There are many stories told of how children receive teaching about
the Omniscience or Omnipotence of God. The stories sound irreverent, and are often repeated
as highly amusing, but they are really more pathetic. Miss Shinn tells of one poor mite who
resented being constantly watched and said, "I will not be so tagged," and another said, "Then
I think He's a very rude man," when, in reply to her puzzled questions, she was told that God
could see her even in her bath. And the boy who said, "If I had done a thing, could God make
it that I hadn't?" must have made his instructor feel somewhat foolish.

It never does harm for us honestly to confess our own limitations and our ignorance, and that
is better than weak materialistic explanations, which after all explain nothing. To tell a
child that the Great Father is always grieved when we are unkind or cowardly, always ready
to help us and to put kindness and bravery into our hearts, that we know He has power to do
that if we will let Him, but that His power is beyond our understanding: to say that He is
able to keep us in all danger, and that even if we are killed we are safe in His keeping, surely
that is enough. He who blessed the children uttered strong words against him who caused the
little ones to stumble.

"From every point, from every object of nature and life there is a way to God.... The things
of nature form a more beautiful ladder between heaven and earth than that seen by Jacob....
It is decked with flowers, and angels with children's eyes beckon us toward it." This is true,
but it does not mean that we are always to be trying to make things sacred, but that we are
to realise that all beauty and all knowledge and all sympathy are already sacred, and that
to love such things is to love something whereby the Creator makes Himself known to us, that
to enjoy them is to enjoy God.

Religion is not always explained as implying the idea of being bound, but sometimes as being
set free from the bonds of the lower or animal nature. In this sense Mr. Clutton Brock may
well call it "a sacred experience" for the child, when he forgets himself in the beauty of
the world. If we could all rise to a wider conception of the meaning of the word religion,
we should know that it comes into all the work of the day, that it does not depend alone upon
that special Scripture lesson which may become mere routine.

The greatest Teacher of all taught by stories, and when any story deepens our feelings for
human nature and our recognition of the heights to which it can rise, when it makes us long
for faith, courage, and love to go and do likewise, who shall say that this is not religious
teaching, teaching which helps to deliver us from the bonds that hamper spiritual ascent.

Many of us will feel with Froebel that the fairy-tale, with its slumbering premonition of being
surrounded by that which is higher and more "conscious than ourselves,"[25] has its place,
and an important place, in religious development.

[Footnote 25: P. 85.]

The "fairy sense," says Dr. Greville Macdonald, "is innate as the religious sense itself ...
the fairy stories best beloved are those steeped in meaning--the unfathomable meaning of life
... such stories teach--even though no lesson was intended--the wisdom of the Book of Job:
wisdom that by this time surely should have made religious teaching saner, and therefore more
acceptable."[26]

[Footnote 26: "The Fairy-Tale in Education," by Greville Macdonald, M.D., Child Life, Dec. 1918.]

Fairies, like angels, may be God's messengers. A child who had heard of St. Cuthbert as a shepherd
boy being carried home from the hillside when hurt, by a man on a white horse, repeated the
story in her own words, "and he thought it was a fairy of God's sent to help him."

There is, however, nothing the children love more than the Bible story, the story which shows,
so simply, humanity struggling as the children struggle, failing as the children fail, and
believing and trusting as the children believe, and as we at least strive to do, in the ultimate
victory of Right over Wrong, of Good over Evil. But just because the stories are often so beautiful
and so inspiring, the teacher should have freedom to deal with them as the spirit moves her.

What experience has taught me in this way has already been passed on to younger teachers in
Education by Life, and there seems little more to add.

  Wonders chiefly at himself
  Who can tell him what he is.

It is for us to tell the child what he is, that he, too, like all the things he loves, is a
manifestation of God.

The very existence of lullabies, not to mention their abundance in all countries, the very
rockers on the cradles testify to the rhythmic nature of man in infancy.

In his Mother Songs, Froebel couples rhythm with harmony of all kinds, not only musical harmony
but harmony of proportion and colour, and in urging the very early training of "the germs of
all this," he gives perhaps the chief reason for training. "If these germs do not develop and
take shape as independent formations in each individual, they at least teach how to understand
and to recognise those of other people. This is life-gain enough, it makes one's life richer,
richer by the lives of others."

It is to the genius of M. Jacques Dalcroze that the world of to-day owes some idea of what
may be effected by rhythmic training, and M. Dalcroze started his work with the same aim that
Froebel set before the mother, that of making the child capable of appreciation, capable of
being made "richer by the lives of others." But Froebel prophesied that far more than appreciation
would come from proper rhythmic training, and this M. Dalcroze has amply proved.

"Through movement the mother tries to lead the child to consciousness of his own life. By regular
rhythmic movement--this is of special importance--she brings this power within the child's
own conscious control when she dandles him in her arms in rhythmic movements and to rhythmic
sounds, cautiously following the slowly developing life in the child, arousing it to greater
activity, and so developing it. Those who regard the child as empty, who wish to fill his mind
from without, neglect the means of cultivation in word and tone which should lead to a sense
of rhythm and obedience to law in all human expression. But an early development of rhythmic
movement would prove most wholesome, and would remove much wilfulness, impropriety and coarseness
from his life, movements, and action, and would secure for him harmony and moderation, and,
later on, a higher appreciation of nature, music, poetry, and art" (Education of Man).

Here, then, is an aim most plainly stated, "higher appreciation of nature, music, poetry and
art," and if we adopt it, we must make sure that we start on a road leading to that end.

To Kindergarten children, apart from movement, rhythm comes first in nursery rhymes, and if
we honestly follow the methods of the mother we shall not teach these, but say or sing them
over and over again, letting the children select their favourites and join in when and where
they like. This is the true Babies' Opera, as Walter Crane justly names an illustrated collection.
Froebel's Mother Songs, though containing a deal of sound wisdom in its mottoes and explanations,
is an annotated, expurgated, and decidedly pedantic version of the nursery rhymes of his own
country. That these should ever have been introduced to our children arose from the fact that
the first Kindergarten teachers, being foreigners, did not know our own home-grown productions.
Long since we have shaken off the foreign product, in favour of our own "Sing a Song of Sixpence,"
"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep" and their refreshingly cheerful compeers. Froebel's book suggests songs
to suit all subjects and all frames of mind--the wind, the moon, and stars, the farm with its
cows and sheep, its hens and chickens, the baker and carpenter, fish in the brook and birds
in nests, the garden and the Christmas fair.

We can supply good verses for all these if we take pains to search, and if we eschew ignorant
and unpoetic modern doggerel as we eschew poison. Besides the nursery rhymes, we have Stevenson,
with his "Wind," "Shadow," and "Swing," Christina Rossetti's "Wrens and Robins," her "Rainbow
Verses" and "Brownie, Brownie, let down your milk, White as swansdown, smooth as silk." There
are many others, and a recent charming addition to our stock is "Chimneys and Fairies," by
Rose Fyleman. One thing we should not neglect, and that is the child's sense of humour. For
the very young this is probably satisfied by the cow that jumps over the moon, the dish that
runs after the spoon, Jill tumbling after Jack, and Miss Muffet running away from the spider.
But older children much enjoy nonsense verses by Lewis Carroll or by Lear, and "John Gilpin"
is another favourite.

It is a mistake to keep strictly within the limits of a child's understanding of the words.
What we want here, as in the realm of Nature, is joy and delight, the delight that comes from
musical words and rhythm, as well as from the pictures that may be called up. Even a child
of four can enjoy the poetry of the Psalms without asking for much understanding.

The mother repeats her rhymes and verses solely to give pleasure, and if our aim is the deepening
of appreciation, there is no reason for leaving the green and grassy path that Nature has showed
to the mother for the hard and beaten track of "recitation." In our own Kindergarten there
has never been either rote learning or recitation. The older children learn the words of their
songs, but not to a word-perfect stage, because words and music suggest each other. Except
for that we just enjoy our verses, the children asking for their favourites and getting new
ones sometimes by request sometimes not. Anything not enjoyed is laid aside. We need variety,
but everything must be good of its kind, and verses about children are seldom for children.
Because children love babies, they love "Where did you come from, baby dear?" but nothing like
Tennyson's "Baby, wait a little longer," and especially nothing of the "Toddlekins" type has
any place in the collection of a self-respecting child. It is doubtful if Eugene Field's verses
are really good enough for children.

All children enjoy singing, but here, as in everything, we must keep pace with development,
or the older ones, especially the boys, may get bored by what suits the less adventurous. In
all cases the music should be good and tuneful, modelled not on the modern drawing-room inanity,
but on the healthy and vigorous nursery rhyme or folk song.

Children also enjoy instrumental music, and will listen to piano or violin while quietly occupied,
for example if they are drawing. One Nursery School teacher plays soft music to get her babies
to sleep, and our little ones fidget less if some one sings softly during their compulsory rest.

"The Kindergarten Band" is another way in which children can join in rhythm. It came to us
from Miss Bishop and is probably the music referred to in the description of the Pestalozzi-Froebel
House. The children are provided with drums, cymbals, tambourines, and triangles, and keep
time to music played on the piano. They can do some analysis in choosing which instruments
are most suitable to accompany different melodies or changes from grave to gay, etc. A full
account was given in Child Life for May 1917.

Several years ago, knowing nothing of M. Dalcroze, Miss Marie Salt began an experiment, the
results of which are likely to be far-spreading and of great benefit. Desiring to help children
to appreciation of good music, Miss Salt experimented deliberately with the Froebelian "learn
through action," and her success has been remarkable. Because of its freedom from any kind
of formality, this system is perhaps better suited to little children than the Dalcroze work,
unless that is in the hands of an exceptionally gifted teacher. M. Dalcroze himself is delightfully
sympathetic with little ones.

Miss Salt tells her own story in an appendix to Mr. Stewart Macpherson's Aural Culture based
on Musical Appreciation.

Good music is played and the children listen and move freely in time to it, sometimes marching
or dancing in circles, sometimes quite freely "expressing" whatever feeling the music calls
forth in them. The stress is laid on listening; if you see a picture you reproduce it, if the
music makes you think of trees or wind, thunder or goblins, you become what you think of. It
is astonishing to see how little children learn in this way to care for music by Schumann,
Mendelssohn, Grieg, Dvorák, Brahms, Chopin, and Beethoven. The music is of course selected
with skill, and care is taken that the "expression" shall not make the children foolishly self-conscious.
Emphasis is always placed on listening, and the children's appreciation is apparent. Such appreciation
must enrich their lives.

CHAPTER XII

FROM FANCY TO FACT

     Creeps ever on from fancy to the fact.

Fairy tales suit little children because their knowledge is so limited, that "the fairies must
have done it" is regarded as a satisfactory answer to early problems, just as it satisfied
childlike Man. Things that to us are wonderful, children accept as commonplace, while others
commonplace to us are marvels to the child. But fairy tales do not continue to satisfy all
needs. As knowledge grows the child begins to distinguish between what may and what may not
happen, though there will always be individual differences, and the more poetic souls are apt
to suffer when the outrush of their imagination is checked by a barbed wire of fact. The question
"Is it true?" and the desire for true stories arise in the average child of seven to eight
years, and at that age history stories are enjoyed. Real history is of course impossible to
young children, whose idea of time is still very vague, and whose understanding of the motives
and actions of those immediately around them is but embryonic. They still crave for adventure
and romance, and they thrill to deeds of bravery. Bravery in the fight appeals to all boys
and to most girls, and it is a question for serious consideration how this admiration is to
be guided, it certainly cannot be ignored. It is legitimate to admire knights who ride about
"redressing human wrongs," fighting dragons and rescuing fair ladies from wicked giants, and
at this stage there is no need to draw a hard and fast line between history and legendary literature.
It is good to introduce children, especially boys, to some of the Arthurian legends if only
to impress the ideal, "Live pure, speak true, right wrong, else wherefore born?" Stories should
always help children to understand human beings, men and women with desires and feelings like
our own. But in history and geography stories we deal particularly with people who are different
from ourselves, and we should help children to understand, and to sympathise with those whose
surroundings and customs are not ours. They may have lived centuries ago, or they may be living
now but afar off, they may be far from us in time or space, but our stories should show the
reasons for their customs and actions, and should tend to lessen the natural tendency to feel
superior to those who have fewer advantages, and gradually to substitute for that a sense of
responsibility.

But the narration of stories is not the only way in which we can treat history. Our present
Minister of Education says that history teaching ought to give "discipline in practical reasoning"
and "help in forming judgements," not merely in remembering facts. Indeed he went so far as
to say "eliminate dates and facts" by which, of course, he only meant that the power of reasoning,
the power of forming judgements is of far more consequence than the mere possession of any
quantity of facts and dates. Training in reasoning, however, must involve training in verification
of facts before pronouncing judgement.

Training in practical reasoning takes a prominent place in that form of history teaching introduced
by Professor Dewey. According to him, history is worth nothing unless it is "an indirect sociology,"
an account of how human beings have learned, so far as the world has yet learned the lesson,
to co-operate with one another, a study of the growth of society and what helps and hinders.
So he finds his beginnings in primitive life, and although there is much in this that will
appeal to any age, there is no doubt that children of seven to ten or eleven revel in this
material.

If used at all it should be used as thinking material--here is man without tools, without knowledge,
everything must be thought out. It does not do much good to hand over the material as a story,
as some teachers use the Dopp series of books. These books do all the children's thinking for
them. Every set of children must work things out for themselves, using their own environments
and their own advantages. The teacher must read to be ready with help if the children fail,
and also to be ready with the actual problems. It is astonishing how keen the children are,
and how often they suggest just what has really happened. Where there is space out-of-doors
and the children can find branches for huts, clay for pots, etc., the work is much easier for
the teacher and more satisfactory. But even where that is impossible and where one has sometimes
to be content with miniature reproductions, the interest is most keen. Children under eight
cannot really produce fire from flints or rubbing sticks, nor can they make useable woollen
threads with which to do much weaving. But even they can get sparks from flint, make a little
thread from wool, invent looms and weave enough to get the ideas.

The romance of "long ago" ought to be taken advantage of to deepen respect for the dignity
of labour. Our lives are so very short that we are apt to get out of perspective in the ages.
Reading and writing are so new--it is only about four hundred years since the first book was
printed in England, the Roman occupation lasted as long, and who thinks of that as a long period?
Perhaps it is because we are in the reading and writing age that our boys and girls must become
"braw, braw clerks," instead of living on and by the land. History, particularly primitive
history, should help us all to be "grateful to those unknown pioneers of the human race to
whose struggles and suffering, discoveries and energies our present favoured mode of existence
on the planet is due. The more people realise the effort that has preceded them and made them
possible, the more are they likely to endeavour to be worthy of it: the more pitiful also will
they feel when they see individuals failing in the struggle upward and falling back toward
a brute condition; and the more hopeful they will ultimately become for the brilliant future
of a race which from such lowly and unpromising beginnings has produced the material vehicle
necessary for those great men who flourished in the recent period which we speak of as antiquity."[29]

[Footnote 29: The Substance of Faith, p. 18.]

Professor Dewey urges that "the industrial history of man is not a materialistic or merely
utilitarian affair," but a matter of intelligence, a record of how men learned to think, and
also an ethical record, "the account of the conditions which men have patiently wrought out
to serve their ends."

This interest in how human beings have created themselves and their surroundings ought to be
deeply interesting to any and every age. Young children can reach so little that one hopes
the interest aroused will be lasting and lead to fruitful work later. But it certainly makes
a good foundation for the study of history and geography, if history is treated as sociology
and if geography is recognised as the study of man in his environment.

Coming now to practical details, in our own work we have followed fairly closely the suggestions
made by Professor Dewey, but everything must vary from year to year according to the suggestions
of the children or their apparent needs. One extra step we have found necessary, and that is
to spend some time over a desert island or Robinson Crusoe stage. Some children can do without
it, but all enjoy it, and the duller children find it difficult to imagine a time when "you
could buy it in a shop" does not fit all difficulties. They can easily grasp the idea of sailing
away to a land "where no man had ever been before," and playing at desert island has always
been a joy.

The starting-points for primitive life have been various; sometimes the work has found its
beginning in chance conversation, as when a child asked, "Are men animals?" and the class took
to the suggestion that man meant thinking animal, and began to consider what he had thought.
Often after Robinson Crusoe there has been a direct question, "How did Robinson Crusoe know
how to make his things; had any one taught him? Who made the things he had seen; who made the
very first and how did he know?" One answer invariably comes, "God taught them," which can
be met by saying this is true, but that God "teaches" by putting things into the world and
giving men power to think. This leads to a discussion about things natural, "what God makes"
and what man makes, which is sometimes illuminating on the limited conceptions of town children.
Years ago we named primitive man "the Long-Ago People," and the title has seemed to give satisfaction,
though once we had the suggestion of "Old-Time Men."

We always start with the need for food, and the children suggest all the wild fruits they know,
often leaving out nuts till asked if there is anything that can be stored for winter. Roots
are not always given, but buds of trees is a frequent answer. Children in the country ought
to explore and to dig, and in our own playground we find at least wild barley, blackberries
of a sort, cherries, hard pears, almonds and cherry gum. Killing animals for food is suggested,
and the children have to be told that the animals were fierce and to realise that in these
times man was hunted, not hunter. Little heads are quite ready to tackle the problem of defence
and attack. They could throw stones, use sticks that the wind blew down, pull up a young tree,
or "a lot of people could hang on to a branch and get it down." When one child suggested finding
a dead animal and using it for food, some were disgusted, but a little girl said, "I don't
suppose they would mind, they wouldn't be very particular."

The idea of throwing stones starts the examination of different kinds, which have to be provided
for the purpose. Flint is invariably selected, and for months the children keep bringing "lovely
sharp flints," but there is much careful observation, observation which has a motive. "I would
put a stone in a stick and chuck it at them" is followed by much experiment at fixing. String
is of course taboo, but bass is allowed because it grows, also strips of skin. We very often
get the suggestion "they might find a stone with a hole in it," which leads to renewed searching
and to the endeavour to make holes. To make a hole in flint is beyond us, but in a softer stone
it can be done.

Then may come the question of safety and tree-climbing, and how to manage with the babies.
Children generally know that tiny babies can hold very tight, and have various ideas for the
mother. How to keep the baby from falling brings the idea of twisting in extra branches, which
is recognised as a cradle in the tree, and the children delight in this as a meaning for "Rock-a-bye,
baby, in the tree-top." The possibility of tree-shelters comes in, and various experiments
are made, sometimes in miniature, sometimes in the garden. Out of this comes the discussion
of clothes. Animals' skins is an invariable suggestion, though all children do not realise
that what they call "fur" means skin.

Skin is provided, and much time is taken in experimenting to see if it can be cut with bits
of flint. How could the long-ago people fasten on the skins, brings the answers "by thorns,"
"tie with narrow pieces," and the children are pleased to see that their own leather belts
are strips or straps. Sometimes much time is taken up in cutting out "skins to wear" from paper
or cheap calico, the children working in pairs, one kneeling down while the other fits on the
calico to see where the head and legs come. The skins are painted or chalked, and pictures
are consulted to see whether the chosen animals are striped or spotted.

It may be stated here that we are not very rigid about periods or climates, and that our long-ago
people are of a generalised type. Our business is not to supply correct information on anthropological
questions, but to call forth thought and originality, to present opportunities for closer observation
than was ever evoked by observation lessons, and for experiments full of meaning and full of
zest. Naturally we do not despise correct information, but these children are very young and
all this work is tentative. We are never dogmatic, it is all "Do you think they might have
..." or "Well, I know what I should have done; I should have ..." and the teacher's reply is
usually "Suppose we try."

Children are apt of course to make startling remarks, but it is only the teacher who is startled
by: "Was all this before God's birthday?" "I don't think God had learned to be very clever
then." It is a curious fact, but orthodox opinion has only twice in the course of many years
brought up Adam and Eve. Probably this is because we never talk about the first man, but about
how things were discovered. The first time the question did come up Miss Payne was taking the
subject, and she suggested that Adam and Eve were never in this country, which disposed of
difficulties so well that I gave the same answer the only time I ever had to deal with the
question.

When we come to the problem of fire, we always use parts of Miss Dopp's story of The Tree-Dwellers.
If the children are asked if they ever heard of fire that comes by itself, or of things being
burned by fire that no human being had anything to do with, one or two are sure to suggest
lightning. They will tell that lightning sometimes sets trees on fire, that thunderstorms generally
come after hot dry weather, and that if lightning struck a tree with dry stuff about the fire
would spread, and the long-ago people would run away. A question from the teacher as to what
these people might think about it may bring the suggestion of a monster; if not, one only has
to say that it must have seemed as if it was eating the trees to get "They would think it was
a dreadful animal." Then the story can be told of how the boy called Bodo stopped to look and
saw the monster grow smaller, so he went closer, fed it on wood, and liked to feel its warm
breath after the heavy rain that follows thunder--why had the monster grown smaller?--found
that no animal would come near it and so on. We never tell of the "fire country," though sometimes
the children read the book for themselves a little later.

We have never succeeded in making flames, but it is thrilling to get sparks from flint. Once
a child brought an old tinder box with steel and flint, but even then we were not skilful enough
to get up a flame. Still it is something to have tried, and we are left with a respectful admiration
for those who could so easily do without matches.

What made these long-ago people think of using their fire to cook food? Our children have suggested
that a bit of raw meat fell into the fire by accident, and we have also worked it out in this
way. We were pretending to warm ourselves by the fire, and I said my frozen meat was so cold
that it hurt my teeth. "Hold it to the fire then." We burned our fingers, and sticks were suggested,
but we sucked the burnt fingers, and I said, "it tastes good," and the children shouted with
glee "Because the meat's roasted really." Then something was supposed to drop, and the cry
was "Gravy! catch it in a shell, dip your finger in and let your baby suck it." A small shell
was suggested, and the boy who said "And put a stick in for a handle" was dubbed "the spoon-maker."
At that time we were earning names for ourselves by suggestions; we started with Fair Hair,
Curly Hair, Big Teeth, Long Legs, and arrived at Quick Runner, Climber, and even Thinker.

We have got at pottery in a similar way. The meat was supposed to be tough. "Soak it" came
at once, and "Could you get hot water?" Then came suggestions: a stone saucepan, scoop out
a stone and put it on the fire, build a stone pan and fix the stones with cherry gum, dig a
hole in the ground and put fire under; "that would be a kind of oven." When asked if water
would stay in the hole, and if any kind of earth would hold water, the answer may be, "No,
nothing but clay, and you'd have to make that." "No! you get clay round a well. My cousin has
a well, and there's clay round it." "Why, there's clay in the playground." "You could put the
meat into a skin bag or a basket." Asked if the skin or basket could be set on the fire, or
if anything could be done to keep the basket from catching fire, the answer comes, "Yes, dab
clay round it. Then," joyfully, "it would hold water and you could boil." "What would happen
to the clay when it was put on the fire?" This has to be discovered by a quick experiment,
but the children readily guess that when the hot water is taken off the fire there would be
"a sort of clay basin. Then they could make more! and plates and cups!"

Experiments depend upon circumstances and upon the age of the children. A thick and tiny basin
put into a hot part of an ordinary fire does harden and hold water to a certain extent even
without glazing. But elaborate baking may also be done.

I have found it convenient to take weaving as a bridge to history stories, by using Sir Frederick
Leighton's picture of the Phoenicians bartering cloth for skins with the early Britons. The
children are told that the people dressed in cloth come from near the Bible-story country,
and those dressed in skins are the long-ago people of this very country. What would these people
think of the cloth? "They would think it was animals' skins." And what would they do? "They'd
feel it and look at it." So cloth is produced and we pull it to pieces, first into threads
and then into hairs, and the children say the hairs are like "fur." Then sheep's wool is produced
and we try to make thread. Attempts at thread-making and then at weaving last a long time,
and along with this come some history stories, probably arising out of the question, "How did
people know about all this?" The children are told about the writings of Julius Caesar, and
pictures of Roman ships and houses are shown, beside pictures of coracles and bee-hive dwellings,
etc. Old coins, a flint battle-axe, some Roman pottery are also shown, along with descriptions
and pictures of the Roman villa at Brading and other Roman remains. The children are thus helped
to realise that other countries exist where the people were far ahead of those in this country,
and they can begin to understand how social conditions vary, and how nations act upon each other.

The work varies considerably from year to year, according to how it takes hold upon the children's
interest. But children of eight to nine are usually considered ready for broad ideas of the
world as a whole, and the inquiry into where Julius Caesar came from, and why he came, gives
a fair start.

CHAPTER XIII

NEW NEEDS AND NEW HELPS

     I am old, so old, I can write a letter.

Writing and reading have no place in the actual Kindergarten, much less arithmetic. The stories
are told to the child; drawing, modelling and such-like will express all he wants to express
in any permanent form, and speech, as Froebel says, is "the element in which he lives." His
counting is of the simplest, and the main thing is to see that he does not merely repeat a
series while he handles material, but that the series corresponds with the objects. Even this
can be left alone if it seems to annoy the little one. In the school he is on a very different
level, he has attained to the abstract, he can use signs: he can express thoughts which he
could not draw, and can communicate with those who are absent. He can read any letter received
and he is no longer dependent on grown-ups for stories. He can count his own money and can
get correct change in small transactions, and he can probably do a variety of sums which are
of no use to him at all.

Between these two comes what Froebel called the Transition or Connecting Class, in which the
child learns the meaning of the signs which stand for speech, and those which make calculation
less arduous for weak memories.

Much has been written as to when and how children are to be taught to read. Some great authorities
would put it off till eight or even ten. Stanley Hall says between six and eight, while Dr.
Montessori teaches children of five and even of four. Froebel would have supported Stanley
Hall and would wait till the age of six. The strongest reason for keeping children back from
books is a physiological one. In the Psychology and Physiology of Reading[30] strong arguments
are adduced against early reading as very injurious to eyesight, so it is surprising that Dr.
Montessori begins so soon. It has been said that her children only learn to write, not to read,
but it is to be supposed that they can read what they write, and therefore can read other material.

[Footnote 30: Macmillan.]

If we agree not to begin until six years old, the next question is the method. The alphabetic,
whereby children were taught the letter names and then memorised the spelling of each single
word, has no supporters. But controversy still goes on as to whether children shall begin with
word wholes or with the phonic sounds. It is not a matter of vital importance, for the children
who begin with words come to phonics later, and so far as English is concerned, the children
who begin with phonics cannot go far without meeting irregularities, unless indeed they are
limited to books like those of Miss Dale.

In other languages which are phonic the difficulties are minimised. Children in the ordinary
Elementary Schools in Italy, though taught in large classes, can write long sentences to dictation
in four or five months.[31] But in Italian each letter has its definite sound and every letter
is sounded. It is true that these children appear to spend most of their time in formal work.

[Footnote 31: A class of children who began in the middle of October wrote correctly to dictation
on March 28, "Patria e lavoro siamo, miei cari bambini, parole sante per voi. Amate la nostra
cara e bella Italia, crescete onesti e laboriosi e sarete degni di lei."]

The Froebelian who believes in learning by action will, of course, expect the children to make
or write from the beginning as a method of learning, whether she begins with words or with
sounds. But in English, unless simplified spelling is introduced, the time must soon come when
reproduction must lag behind recognition. One child said with pathos one day, "May we spell
as we like to-day, for I've got such a lot to say?"

The phonic method dates back to about 1530. The variety used in the Pestalozzi-Froebel House
is said to have originated with Jacotot (1780-1840). It is called the "Observing-Speaking-Writing
and Reading Method." Froebel's own adaptation was simpler; it was his principle to begin with
a desire on the part of the child, and he gives his method in story form, "How Lina learned
to write and read." Lina is six, she has left the Kindergarten and is presently to attend the
Primary School. She notices with what pleasure her father, perhaps a somewhat exceptional parent,
receives and answers letters. She desires to write and her mother makes her say her own name
carefully, noticing first the "open" or vowel sounds and then by noting the position of her
tongue she finds the closed sounds. As she hears the sound she is shown how to make it. Her
father leaves home at the right moment, Lina writes to him, receives and is able to read his
answer, printed like her own in Roman capitals. He sends her a picture book and she is helped
to see how the letters resemble those she has learned and the reading is accomplished.

In England the phonic method best known is probably Miss Dale's. It is very ingenious, the
analysis is thorough and the books are prettily got up, but to those who feel that reading,
though a most valuable tool, still is but a tool and one not needed for children under seven,
the method seems over-elaborate. Much depends upon the teacher but to see fifty children sitting
still while one child places the letters in their places on the board suggests a great deal
of lost time. The system is also so rigidly phonic that it is a long time before a child can
pick up an ordinary book with any profit.

Stanley Hall holds that it is best to combine methods, and probably most of us do this. "The
growing agreement" is, he says, "that there is no one and only orthodox way of teaching and
learning this greatest and hardest of all the arts, in which ear, mouth, eye and hand must
each in turn train the others to automatic perfection, in ways hard and easy, by devices old
and new, mechanically and consciously, actively and passively ... this is a great gain and
seems now secure. While a good pedagogic method is one of the most economic--both of labour
and of money--of all inventions, we should never forget that the brightest children, and indeed
most children, if taught individually or at home, need but very few refinements of method.
Idiots, as Mr. Seguin first showed, need and profit greatly by very elaborated methods in learning
how to walk, feed and dress themselves, which would only retard a normal child. Above all it
should be borne in mind that the stated use of any method does not preclude the incidental
use of any and perhaps of all others."

An adaptation of phonic combined with the word method can be found in Education by Life. It
is simpler than Miss Dale's, and being combined with the word method, children get much more
quickly to real stories. Stanley Hall advocates the individual teaching of reading, and since
Dr. Montessori called every one's attention to this we have used it much more freely, and have
found that once the children know some sounds, there is a great advantage in a certain amount
of individual learning, but class teaching has its own advantages and it seems best to have
a combination. Long since we taught a boy who was mentally deficient and incapable of intelligent
analysis, by whole words and corresponding pictures. Miss Payne has developed this to a great
extent. It is practically an appeal to the interest in solving puzzles. The children choose
their own pictures and are supplied with envelopes containing either single sounds, or whole
words corresponding with the picture. They lay h on the house, g on the girl, p on the pond,
and later do the same with words. They certainly enjoy it, and no one is ever kept waiting.
Sometimes the puzzle is to set in order the words of a nursery rhyme which they already know,
sometimes it is to read and draw everything mentioned.

It is not only how children learn to read that is important: even more so is what they read.
Much unintelligent reading in later life is due to the reading primer in which there was nothing
to understand. Children should read books, as adults do, to get something out of them. The
time often wasted in teaching reading too soon would be far better employed in cultivating
a taste for good reading by telling or reading to the children good stories and verses.[32]

[Footnote 32: It is difficult to find easy material that is worth giving to intelligent children,
and we have been glad to find Brown's Young Artists' Readers, Series A.]

A revolution is going on just now in the method of teaching writing. It is now generally recognised
that much time and effort have been wasted in teaching children to join letters which are easier
to read unjoined.

A very interesting article appeared in the Fielden School Demonstration Record No. II., and
Mr. Graily Hewitt has brought the subject of writing as it was done before copperplate was
invented very much to the fore. The Child Study Society has published a little monograph on
the subject giving the experience of different teachers and specimens of the writing.

Little Marjorie Fleming was a voracious reader with a remarkable capacity for writing. Her
spelling was unconventional at times, but there was never any doubt about her meaning. She
expressed herself strongly on many subjects, and one of these was arithmetic.

There are a few little children who are really fond of number work. There are not many of them,
and they would probably learn more if they were left to themselves. There are even a few mathematical
geniuses who hardly want teaching, but who are worthy of being taught by a Professor of Mathematics,
always supposing that he is worthy of them. But the majority of children would probably be
farther advanced at ten or twelve if they had no teaching till they were seven. They ought
to learn through actual number games, through keeping score for other games, and through any
kind of calculation that is needed for construction or in real life.

There are but few true number games, but dominoes and card games introduce the number groups.
In "Old maid" the children pair the groups and so learn to recognise them; in dominoes they
use this knowledge, while "Snap" involves quick recognition. Any one can make up a game in
which scoring is necessary. Ninepins or skittles is a number game, and one can score by using
number groups, or by fetching counters, shells, beads, etc., as reminders. The number groups
are important; they form what Miss Punnett calls "a scheme" for those who have no great visualising
power, and they combine the smallest groups into large ones. It ought to be remembered that
the repetition of a group is an easier thing to deal with than the combination of two groups,
that is, six is a name for two threes and eight for two fours, but five and seven have not
so definite a meaning.[33]

[Footnote 33: This very morning a child cutting out brown paper pennies for a shop said, 'Look!
there are two sixes; that would be a big number!']

The Tillich bricks are good playthings, and so is cardboard money--shillings, sixpences, threepences,
pence and halfpence.

When the names have a meaning the children will want signs, i.e. figures. Clock figures (Roman)
can be used first as simplest, showing the closed fingers and the thumb for V; the only difficulty
is IX. The Arabic figures can be made by drawing round the number groups, or by laying out
their shapes in little sticks. 5 and 8 show very plainly how to arrange five and eight sticks;
for two and three they are placed horizontally, the curves merely joining the lines.

In teaching children to count, the decimal system should be kept well in mind, and the teacher
should see that thirteen means three-ten, and that the children can touch the three and the
ten as they speak the word. Eleven and twelve ought to be called oneteen and twoteen, half
in joke. The idea of grouping should never be lost sight of, and larger numbers should at first
be names for so many threes, fours, fives, etc. In order to keep the meaning clear the children
should say threety, fourty and fivety, but there should be no need to write these numbers.
The Kindergarten sticks tied in bundles of ten are quite convenient counting material when
any counting is necessary. Tram tickets and cigarette pictures can be used in the same way.

The decimal notation is a great thing to learn, how great any one will discover who will take
the trouble to work a simple addition sum, involving hundreds, in Roman figures. Children are
always taught the number of the house they live in, which makes a starting-point. If, for instance,
35 is compared with XXXV a meaning is given to the 3.

Many teachers make formal sums of numbers which could quite well be added without any writing
at all. By using any kind of material by which ten can be made plain as a higher unit--bundles
of sticks or tickets, Sonnenschein's apparatus, Miss Punnett's number scheme, or the new Montessori
apparatus with its chains of beads: the material used is of no great consequence--children
should be able to deal as easily with tens as with ones, and there is no need for little formal
sums which have no meaning.

Everything in daily life should be used before formal work is attempted. "Measure, reckon,
weigh, compare," said Rousseau. Children love to measure, whether by lineal or liquid measure,
or by learning to tell the time or to use a pair of scales.

There are a few occasions when interest is in actual number relations, as when a child for
himself discovers that two sixes is six twos. One boy on his own account compared a shilling
and an hour, and said that he could set out a shilling in five parts by the clock. He looked
at the clock and chose out a sixpence, a threepence, and 3 pennies. But usually what is abstract
belongs to a stage farther on.

So we can end where we began, by letting Froebel once more define the Kindergarten.

"Crèches and Infant Schools must be raised into Kindergartens wherein the child is treated
and trained according to his whole nature, so that the claims of his body, his heart and his
head, his active, moral and intellectual powers, are all satisfied and developed.

"Not the training of the memory, not learning by rote, not familiarity with the appearances
of things, but culture by means of action, realities and life itself, bring a blessing upon
the individual, and thereby a blessing upon the whole community; since each one, be he the
highest or the humblest, is a member of the community."

PART II

THE CHILD IN THE STATE SCHOOL

I. THINGS AS THEY ARE

CHAPTER XIV

CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF GROWTH

Early in the nineteenth century two men, moved by very different impulses, founded what might
be considered the beginnings of the Infant School. For nearly fifty years their work grew separately,
but now they are merged together into something that seems to be permanent.

In a bleak Lanarkshire factory village in the south of Scotland, Robert Owen, millowner, socialist
and Welshman, found that unless he could provide for the education of the children of his factory
hands, no parents would consent to settle in the district and he would be without workers in
his mill. As a consequence Owen found himself in the position of education authority, privy
purse and organiser, and he did not flinch from the situation; he imposed no cheap makeshift,
because he believed in education as an end and not as an economic means; a twofold institution
was therefore established by him in 1816, one part for the children of recognised school age,
presumably over six, and one for those under school age, whose only entrance test was their
ability to walk. It is with the latter that we are concerned.

The instructions given by Owen to the man and the women he chose for his Infant School may
serve to show his general aim; the babies under their care were above all to be happy, to lead
a natural life, outdoor or indoor as weather permitted; learning their surroundings, playing,
singing, dancing, "not annoyed with books," not shadowed by the needs of the upper school,
but living the life their age demanded. In the light of the 1918 Education Bill this seems
almost prophetic.

Their guardians were selected solely on the grounds of personality, and expected to work in
the spirit in which Owen conceived the school. They were gentle, without personal ambition,
fond of children, caring only for their welfare; but the sole guiding principle was Owen, and
this was at once the success and doom of the school, for the personality of Owen was thus made
the pivot round which the school revolved; without him there was nothing to take hold of.

Very soon the experiment became known: persons with the stamp of authority came to see it,
and even official hearts were moved by the reality of the children's happiness and their consequent
development. The visitors felt, rather than knew, that the thing was right. Arrangements were
made to establish similar institutions in London, and after one or two experiments, a permanent
one was founded which was under the control of a man named Wilderspin.

Wilderspin's contribution to education is difficult to estimate; certainly he never caught
Owen's spirit, or realised his simple purpose: he had ambitions reaching beyond the happiness
of the children; and far from trying to make their education suit their stage of growth, he
sought to produce the "Infant Prodigy," just as a contemporary of his sought to produce the
"Infant Saint." From what we can see, his aim was what he honestly believed to be right, as
far as his light went; but he sought for no light beyond his own; and his outlook was not so
narrow as his application was unintelligent. Owen was still in Lanarkshire to be consulted;
Rousseau had already written Émile, Pestalozzi's work was by this time fairly well known in
England, the children were there to be studied, but Wilderspin pursued his limited and unenlightened
work, until the Infant School was almost a dead thing in his hands and in the hands of those
who followed. The following is Birchenough's account:

"The school was in charge of a master and a female assistant, presumably his wife. Much attention
was given to training children in good personal habits, cleanliness, tidiness, punctuality,
etc., and to moral training. Great stress was laid on information.... The curriculum included
reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, lessons on common objects, geography, singing and religion,
and an effort was made to make the work interesting and 'concrete.' To this end much importance
was attached to object-lessons, to the use of illustrations, to questioning and exposition,
while the memory was aided by means of didactic verse.... The real teaching devolved upon the
master and mistress. This was of two kinds: class teaching to a section of the children of
approximately equal attainments either on the floor or in the class-room, and collective teaching
to the whole school, regardless of age, on the gallery."

It is a curious coincidence that in 1816, the year of Owen's experiment, a humble educational
experiment was begun by Frederick Froebel in a very small village in the heart of the Thuringian
forest. Like Owen, his aim was education solely for its own sake, and he had a simple faith
in the human goodness of the older Germany. But he came to education as a philosopher rather
than a social reformer, with a strong belief in its power to improve humanity. This belief
remained with him; it is embodied in his aim, and leavened all his work.

The first twenty years of his experience convinced Froebel that the neglect or mismanagement
of the earliest years of a child's life rendered useless all that was done later. What came
to Owen as an inspiration grew in Froebel to be a reasoned truth, and like Owen he put it into
practice. In 1837 the little Kindergarten at Blankenburg was begun, with the village children
as pupils; the beautiful surroundings of forest-covered hills and green slopes made a very
different background from the bleak little Lanarkshire village, overshadowed by the factory,
where Owen's school stood, but the spirit was the same; the children were in surroundings suitable
for their growth, and the very name of Kindergarten does more to make Froebel's aim clear than
any explanation. He lived to see other Kindergartens established in different parts of Thuringia,
and about the middle of the nineteenth century some of his teachers came to England, and did
similar work in London, Croydon and Manchester. The private Kindergarten became an established
thing, and educationalists came to understand something of its meaning.

In 1870 the London School Board suggested that the Kindergarten system should be introduced
into their Infant Schools, and in doing so they were unconsciously the factors in bringing
together the work initiated by Owen and by Froebel. The Infant School of Wilderspin, already
briefly described, was almost a dead thing, with its galleries and its mechanical prodigies,
its object-lessons and its theology; now it was breathed upon by the spirit of the man who
said: "Play is the highest phase of child development, of human development at this period:
for it is the spontaneous representation of the inner, from inner necessity and impulse." "Play
is the purest, most spiritual activity of man." "The plays of childhood are the germinal leaves
of all later life." "If the child is injured at this period, if the germinal leaves of the
future tree of his life are marred at this time, he will only with the greatest difficulty
and the utmost effort grow into strong manhood."

It is perhaps not altogether to be wondered at that teachers at first seized the apparatus
rather than the spirit of the Kindergarten when we remember that we have not accepted in anything
like its fulness the teaching of Froebel. Formalism and materialism always die slowly: play
in the Board School was interpreted as something that had to be dictated and taught: the gifts,
occupations and games were organised, and appeared on the time-table as subjects side by side
with Wilderspin's theology and object-lessons. The combination must have been curious, but
even with its formalism the change was welcome to the children: at least they could use their
hands and do something; at least they could leave their back-breaking galleries and dance and
skip, even though the doing and the dancing were according to strict rule.

The change was not welcome to all teachers. As late as 1907 a headmistress who was a product
of the training of that time remarked: "We have Kindergarten on Wednesday afternoons and then
it is over for the week." But there were teachers who saw beneath the bricks and sticks and
pretty movements, who felt the spiritual side and kept themselves alive till greater opportunities
came. What was imperishable has remained; the system of prescribed activities is nearly dead,
but the spirit of the true Kindergarten is more alive than ever.

The change from the early 'eighties till now is difficult to describe, because it is a growth
of spirit, a gradual change of values, rather than a change in outward form; there has been
no definite throwing off, and no definite adoption, of any one system or theory; but the difference
between the best Infant Schools of 1880 and the best Infant Schools of to-day is chiefly a
difference in outlook. The older schools aimed at copying a method, while the schools of to-day
are more concerned with realising the spirit.

At present we are trying to reconstruct education for the new world after the war, and so it
is convenient to regard the intervening period of nearly half a century as a transition period:
during that time the education of the child under eight has changed much more than the education
of older children, at least in the elementary school; and there have been certain marked phases
that, though apparently insignificant in themselves, have marked stages of progress in thought.

Perhaps the most significant and most important of these was the effect of the child-study
movement on the formal and external side of Kindergarten work. It is first of all to America
that we owe this, to the pioneer Stanley Hall, and more especially here to Mr. Earl Barnes.
Very slowly, but surely, it was evident to the more enlightened teachers that children had
their own way of learning and doing, and the adult-imposed system meant working against nature.
For the logical method of presenting material from the simple to the complex, from the known
to the unknown, from the concrete to the abstract, was substituted the psychological method
of watching the children's way of learning and developing. Teachers found that what they considered
to be "the simple" was not the simple to children; what they took to be "the known" was the
unfamiliar to children. For instance, the "simple" in geography, in the adult sense, was the
definition of an island, with which most of us began that study, and in geometry it was the
point. To children of the ordinary type, both are far-away ideas, and not related to everyday
experiences; "the known" in arithmetic, for example, was to teachers the previous lesson, quite
regardless of the fact that arithmetic enters into many problems of life outside school. The
life in school and the life outside school were, in these early days of infant teaching, two
separate things, and only occasionally did a teacher stoop to take an example from everyday
life. A little girl in one of the poorest schools brought her baby to show her teacher, and
proudly displayed the baby's powers of speech--"Say a pint of 'alf-an-'alf for teacher," said
the little girl to the baby by way of encouragement to both. This is the kind of rude awakening
teachers get, from time to time, when they realise how much of the real child eludes them.
Psychology has made it clear that life is a unity and must be so regarded.

Part of this child-study movement has resulted in the slow but sure death of formalism: large
classes, material results, and a lack of psychology made formalism the path of least resistance.
Painting became "blobbing," constructive work was interpreted as "courses" of paper folding,
cutting, tearing; books of these courses were published with minute directions for a graduated
sequence. The aim was obedient imitation on the part of the child, and the imagined virtues
accruing to him in consequence were good habits, patience, accuracy and technical skill. Self-expression
and creativeness were still only theories.

A second interesting phase of the transition period was the method adopted for the training
of the senses. From the days of Comenius till now the importance of this has held its place
firmly, but the means have greatly changed. Pestalozzi's object-lesson was adopted by Wilderspin
and thoroughly sterilised; many teachers still remember the lessons on the orange, leather,
camphor, paper, sugar, in which the teacher's senses were trained, for only she came in contact
with the object, and the children from their galleries answered questions on an object remote
from most of their senses, and only dimly visible to their eyes. Similar lessons were given
after 1870 on Froebel's gift II. in which the ball, cylinder and cube were treated in the same
manner: progress was slow, but sometimes the children followed nature's promptings and played
with their specimens; this was followed by books of "gift-plays," where organised play took
the place of organised observation.

About 1890 or thereabouts the Nature Study movement swept over the schools, and "nature specimens"
then became the material for sense training: as far as possible each child had a specimen,
and by the minute examination of these, stimulated their senses and stifled their appreciation
of all that was beautiful.

Question and answer still dominated the activity; the poor little withered snowdrop took the
place of the dead camphor or leather. But underlying all the paralysing organisation the truth
was slowly growing, and the children were being brought nearer to real things.

A third phase in this transition period is that known as "correlation"; most teachers remember
the elaborate programmes of work that drove them to extremes in finding "connections." The
following, taken from a reputable book of the time, will exemplify the principle:

  A WEEK'S PROGRAMME

  Object Lesson         The Horse.
  Phonetics             The Foal, oa sound.
  Number                Problems on the work of horses.
  Story                 The Bell of Atri [story of a horse ringing a bell].
  Song                  Busy Blacksmith [shoeing a horse].
  Game                  The Blacksmith's Shop.
  Reading               On the Horse.
  Poetry                Kindness to Animals.
  Paper Cutting         The Bell of Atri.
  Paper Folding         A Trough.
  Free-arm Drawing      A Horseshoe.
  Clay Modelling        A Carrot for the Horse.
  Brushwork             A Turnip for the Horse.
  Brown Paper Drawing   A Stable.

Underneath it all the truth was growing, namely, the need of making associations and so unifying
the children's lines. But the process of finding the truth was slow and cumbersome.

A fourth phase of the early Infant School was the strong belief of both teachers and inspectors
in uniformity of work and of results. It is difficult to disentangle this from the paralysing
influences of payment by results and large classes: it was probably the teachers' unconscious
expression of the instinct of self-preservation, when working against the heaviest odds. But
it was constantly evident to the teacher that any attempt on a child's part to be an individual,
either in work or in conduct, had to be arrested: and the theory of individual development
was regarded as so Utopian that the idea itself was lost. Goodness was synonymous with uniform
obedience and silence; naughtiness with individuality, spontaneity and desire to investigate.
A frequently-heard admonition on the part of the teacher was, "Teacher didn't tell you to do
it that way--that's a naughty way"; but such an attitude of mind was doubtless generated by
the report of the inspector when he commended a class by saying: "The work of the class showed
a satisfactory uniformity."

To obtain uniform results practice had to come before actual performance, and many weary hours
were spent over drill in reading, drill in number, drill in handwork, drill in needlework.
The extreme point was reached when babies of three had thimble and needle drill long before
they began needlework. There were also conduct drills; Miss Grant, of Devons Road School, remembers
a school where the babies "practised" their conduct before the visit of the "spectre," as they
called him, he being represented as a stick set up on a chair. There is a curious symbolism
in the whole occasion.

It is difficult to see the good underlying this phase, but it was there. There is undoubtedly
a place for practice, though not before performance, and uniformity was undoubtedly the germ
of an ideal.

All these phases stand for both progress and arrest. The average person is readier to accept
methods than investigate principles; but we must recognise that all struggles and searchings
after truth have made the road of progress shorter for us by many a mile.

Perhaps the chief cause of stumbling lay in the fact that there was no clearly realised aim
or policy except that of material results. There were many fine-sounding principles in the
air, but they were unrelated to each other; and the conditions of teaching were likely to crush
the finest endeavours, and to make impossible a teaching that could be called educative.

CHAPTER XV

THE INFANT SCHOOL OF TO-DAY

Taking neither the best nor the worst, but the average school of to-day, it will be profitable
to review shortly where it stands, to consider how far it has learnt the lessons of experience,
and what kind of ideal it has set before itself.

In externals there have been many improvements. Modern buildings are better in many ways; there
is more space and light, and the surroundings are more attractive. Most of the galleries have
disappeared, but the furniture consists chiefly of dual desks, fixed and heavy, so that the
arrangement of the room cannot be changed. The impression given to a visitor is that it is
planned for listening and answering, except in the Baby Room, where there are generally light
tables and chairs, and consequently no monotonous rows of children, unless a teacher arranges
them thus from sheer habit. In each room is a high narrow cupboard about one quarter of the
necessary size for all that education demands; most education authorities provide some good
pictures, but the best are usually hung on the class-room wall behind the children, and all
are above the children's eye level. "Oh, teacher, my neck do ache!" was the only appreciative
remark made by a child after a tour made of the school pictures, which were really beautiful.

As a rule the windows are too high for the children to see from, and the lower part is generally
frosted. In a new school which had a view up one of the loveliest valleys in Great Britain,
the windows were of this description; the head of the school explained that it was a precaution
in case the children might see what was outside; in other words, they might make the mistake
of seeing a real river valley instead of listening to a description of it.

In country schools of the older type the accommodation is not so good, but the newer ones are
often very attractive in appearance, and have both space and light. The school garden is a
common feature in the country, and it is to be regretted so few even of the plot description
are to be found in town schools.

Of late years the apparatus has improved, though there is still much to be done in this direction.
Instead of the original tiny boxes of gifts we have frequently real nursery bricks of a larger
and more varied character, and many other nursery toys. One of the best signs of a progressive
policy is that large numbers of little toys have taken the place of the big expensive ones
that only an occasional child could use. It is a pity that the use of toys comes to so sudden
an end, and that learning by this method does not follow the babies after they have officially
ceased to be babies, as is the custom in real life.

One of the most striking changes for the better is the evidence of care of the children's health,
of which some of the external signs are doctor, nurse and care committee. A sense of responsibility
in this respect is gradually growing in the schools; a fair number provide for sleep, a few
try to train the children to eat lunch slowly and carefully, and some try to arrange for milk
or cod-liver oil in the case of very delicate children. Though these instances are very much
in the minority, they represent a change of spirit. This is one of the striking characteristics
of the new Education Bill. A legacy from the old formalism lies in the fact that every room
has a highly organised time-table, except perhaps in the Babies' Room, where the children's
actual needs are sometimes considered first. The morning in most classes is occupied with Scripture,
Reading, Arithmetic, Writing, and some less formal work, such as Nature lesson or Recitation;
some form of Physical Exercise is always taken. The afternoons are mostly devoted to Games,
Stories, Handwork and Singing: this order is not universal, but the general principle holds,
of taking the more difficult and formal subjects in the morning. In the Babies' Room some preparation
for reading is still too frequent. The lessons are short and the order varied, but in one single
morning or afternoon there is a bewildering number of changes. Some years ago the unfortunate
principle was laid down in the Code, that fifteen minutes was sufficient time for a lesson
in an Infant School, and though this is not strictly followed the lessons are short and numerous,
giving an unsettled character to the work; children appear to be swung at a moment's notice
from topic to topic without an apparent link or reason: for example, the day's work may begin
with the story of a little boy sent by train to the country, settled at a farm and taken out
to see the cow and the sow: soon this is found to be a reading lesson on words ending in "ow,"
but after a short time the whole class is told quite suddenly, that one shilling is to be spent
at a shop in town, and while they are still interested in calculating the change, paints are
distributed, and the children are painting the bluebell. The whole day is apt to be of this
broken character, which certainly does not make for training in mental concentration, or for
a realisation of the unity of life. Some teachers still aim at correlation, but in a rather
half-hearted way: others have entirely discarded it because of its strained applications, but
nothing very definite has taken its place.

The curriculum which has been given is varied in character, and sometimes includes a "free
period." Except in the Babies' Class the three R's occupy a prominent place, and children under
six spend relatively a great deal of time in formal subjects, while children between six and
seven, if they are still in the Infant School, are taught to put down sums on paper, which
they could nearly always calculate without such help. As soon as a child can read well, and
work a fair number of sums on paper, he is considered fit for promotion, and the question of
whether he understands the method of working such sums, is not considered so important as accuracy
and quickness. The test of so-called intelligence for promotion is reading and number, but
it is really the test of convenience, so that large numbers of children may be taught together
and brought, against the laws of nature, to a uniform standard.

This poison of the promotion and uniformity test works down through the Infant School: it can
be seen when the babies are diverted from their natural activities to learn reading, or when
they are "examined": it can be seen when a teacher yields up her "bright" children to fill
a few empty desks, it can be seen in the grind at reading and formal arithmetic of the children
under six, when weary and useless hours are spent in working against nature, and precious time
is wasted that will never come back. Yet we say we believe that "Children have their youth
that they may play," and that "Play is the purest, most spiritual activity of man at this stage"
[childhood].

The lack of any clear aim shows itself in the fluid nature of the term "results"; to some teachers
it signifies readiness for promotion, or a piece of work that presents a satisfactory external
appearance, such as good writing, neat handwork, an orderly game, fluent reading. To others
it means something deeper, which they discover in some chance remark of a child's that marks
the growth of the spirit, or the awakening of the interest of a child whose development is
late, or the quickened power of a child to express; or evidence of independent thought and
the power to use it, in some piece of handwork, or appreciation of music or literature. According
to the meaning attached to the term "results" so the method of the teacher must vary; but one
gets the general impression that in this respect matters are in a transitional state; the first
kind of teacher is always a little uncertain of her ground and a little fearful that she is
not quite "up-to-date," while the second class of teacher is sometimes a little timid, and
not quite sure that she is prepared to account for the rather subtle and intangible outcome
of her work.

The same transitional character holds in the case of discipline: while what is known as "military"
discipline still prevails in many schools, there are a very fair number with whom the grip
has relaxed; but it is a courageous teacher that will admit the term "free discipline" which
has nearly as bad a reputation as "free thought" used to have, and few are prepared to go all
the way. Probably the reason lies in the vagueness of the meaning of the term, and the fact
that its value is not clearly realised because it is not clearly understood. Teachers have
not faced the question squarely: "What am I aiming at in promoting free discipline."

Taking a general view of the present school, one gets the impression of a constant change of
activity on the part of the children, but very little change of position, a good deal of provision
for general class interest, but little for individual interest; of less demand than formerly
for uniformity of results, but the existence of a good deal of uniformity of method, arresting
the teacher's own initiative; of very constant teaching on the part of the teacher and a good
deal of listening and oral expression on the part of the children, of many lessons and little
independent individual work. Below all this there is evident a very friendly relationship between
the teacher and the children, a good deal of personal knowledge of the children on the part
of the teacher, and a good deal of affection on both sides. There is less fear and more love
than in the earlier days, less government and more training, less restraint and more freedom.
And the children are greatly attached to their school.

From consideration of the foregoing summary it will be seen that education in the Infant School
is a thing of curious patches, of strength and weakness, of light and shade; perhaps the greatest
weakness is its lack of cohesion, of unification: on the one hand we find much provision for
the children's real needs, much singleness of purpose in the teacher's work, such a genuine
spirit of whole-hearted desire for their education: on the other hand, an unreasoning sense
of haste, of pushing on, of introducing prematurely work for which the children admittedly
are unready; an acceptance of new things on popular report, without scientific basis, and a
lack of courage to maintain the truth for its own sake, in the face of so-called authority,
and a craving to be modern. At the root of all this inconsistency and possibly its cause, is
the lack of a guiding policy or aim, the lack of belief in the scientific or psychological
basis of education, and consequently the want of that strong belief in absolute truth which
helps the teacher to pass all barriers.

CHAPTER XVI

SOME VITAL PRINCIPLES

If it be true that the Infant School of to-day suffers from lack of a clear basis for its general
policy, it will be profitable to have clearly before us such principles as great educators
have found to be most vital to the education of young children.

We all believe that we have an aim and a high aim before us: it has been variously expressed
by past educationalists, but in the main they all agree that the aim of education is conduct.

In actual practice, however, we act too often as if we only cared for economic values. If we
are to live up to our educational profession, we must look our aim in the face and honestly
practise what we believe.

While training of character and conduct is the accepted aim for education in general, to make
this useful and practical each teacher must fix her attention on how this ultimate aim affects
her own special part of the whole work. By watching the free child she will discover how best
she can help him: he knows his own business, and when unfettered by advice or command shows
plainly that he is chiefly concerned with gaining experience. He finds himself in what is to
him a new and complex world of people and things; actual experience is the foundation for complete
living, and the stronger the foundation the better the result of later building. The first
vital principle then is that the teacher of young children must provide life in miniature;
that is, she must provide abundant raw material and opportunities for experience.

The next question is that of the best method of gaining this actual experience. The child is
unaware that he is laying foundations, he is only vaguely conscious that he finds great pleasure
in certain activities, and that something impels him in certain directions. He realises no
definite future, he is content with the present; he cannot work for a purpose other than the
pleasure of the moment; without this stimulus concentration is impossible. In the activities
of this stage he probably assimilates more actual matter than at any other period of his life,
and it is the same with his acquirements of skill. In happy unconsciousness he gains knowledge
of his own body and of its power, of the external world, of his mother tongue and of his relations
to other people: he makes mistakes and commits faults, but these do not necessarily cripple
or incriminate him. He is not considered a social outcast because he once kicked or bit, or
because he threw his milk over the table; he learns to balance and adjust his muscles on a
seesaw, when a fall on soft grass is a matter of little importance, and this is better than
waiting till he is compelled hastily to cross a river on a narrow plank. It is all a kind of
joyous rehearsal of life which we call Play. We can force a child to passivity, to formal repetitions
of second-hand knowledge, to the acquisition of that for which he has no apparent need, but
we can never educate him by these things. "Children do not play because they are young, they
have their youth that they may play," as surely as they have their legs that they may walk.

The second principle is therefore that the method of gaining experience lies through Play,
and that by this road we can best reach work.

The third principle is the nature of the experience that a child seeks to gain--the life he
desires to live. How can we he sure that the surroundings we provide and the activities we
encourage are in accord with children's needs?

Let us imagine a child of about five to six years of age, one of a family, living in a small
house to which a garden is attached; inside he has the run of the house, but keeps his own
toys, picture books and collections of treasures. We will suppose that not being at school
he is free to arrange his own day, sometimes alone, and sometimes with other children, or with
his parents. What does he do?

He is interested in inanimate things, especially in using them, and so he plays with his toys.
He builds bricks, runs engines, solves simple puzzle pictures, asks to work with his father's
gardening tools, or his mother's cooking utensils. He is interested in the life of the garden,
in the growing things, in the snail or spider he finds, in the cat, dog or rabbit of the family;
he wants to dig, water and feed these various things, but he declines regular responsibility;
his interest is in spurts.

He is interested in sounds, both in those he can produce and in those produced by others: soon
he is interested in music, he will listen to it for considerable periods, and may join in it:
at first more especially on the rhythmical side. So, too, he likes the rhythm of poetry and
the melody sounds of words. He is interested in making things; on a wet day he will ask for
scissors and paste, or bring out his paint box or chalks; on a fine day he mixes sand or mud
with water, or builds a shelter with poles and shawls; at any time when he has an opportunity
he shuts himself into the bathroom and experiments with the taps, sails boats, colours water,
blows bubbles, tries to mix things, wet and dry.

He is interested in the doings of other people, in their conduct and in his own; he is more
interested in their badness than in their goodness: "Tell me more of the bad things your children
do," said a little boy to his teacher aunt, and the request is significant and general; we
learn so little by mere uncontrasted goodness. He is interested in the words that clothe narrations
and in their style, he is impatient of a change in form of an accepted piece of prose or poetry.
He is hungry for the sounds of telling words and phrases.

He is interested in reproducing the doings of other people so that he may experience them more
fully, and this involves minute observation, careful and intelligent imitation, and vivid imagination.
His own word for it is pretence.

There are other things that he grasps at more vaguely and later; he is dimly aware that people
have lived before, and he is less dimly aware that people live in places different from his
own surroundings. He realises that some of the stories, such as the fairy stories, are true
in one sense, a sense that responds to something within himself; that some are true in another
more material, and external sense, one concerned with things that really happen. He hears of
"black men," and of "ships that carry people across the sea," and of "things that come back
in those ships."

He is interested in the immaterial world suggested by the mysteries of woods and gardens, he
has a dim conception that there is some life beyond the visible, he feels a power behind life
and he reveals this in his early questions. He is keenly interested in questions of birth and
death, and sometimes comes into close contact with them. He feels that other wonders must be
accounted for--the snow, thunder and lightning, the colours of summer, the changeful sea. At
first the world of fairy lore may satisfy him, later comes the life of the undying spirit,
but the two are continuous. He may attend "religious observances," and these may help or they
may hinder.

He is keenly interested in games, whether they are games of physical skill, of mental skill,
or games of pretence. Here most especially he comes into contact with other people, and here
he realises some of the experiences of social life.

Such are the most usual sides of life sought by the ordinary child, and on such must we base
the surroundings we provide for our children in school, and the aspects of life to which we
introduce them, commonly called subjects of the curriculum.

Our third principle is therefore, evident: we find, in the child's spontaneous choice, the
nature of the surroundings and of the activities that he craves for; in other words, he makes
his own curriculum and selects his own subject matter.

The next consideration is the atmosphere in which a child can best develop character by means
of these experiences. A young child is a stranger in an unknown, untried country: he has many
strange promptings that seek for satisfaction; he has strong emotions arising from his instincts,
he feels crudely and fiercely and he must act without delay, as a result of these emotions.
He is like a tourist in a new strange country, fresh and eager, and with a similar holiday
spirit of adventure: the stimulation of the new arouses a desire to interpret, to investigate
and to ask questions: it arouses strong emotions to like or dislike, to fear, to be curious;
it leads to certain modes of conduct, as a result of these emotions. Picture such a young tourist
buttonholed by a blasé guide, who had forgotten what first impressions meant, who insisted
on accompanying him wherever he went, regulating his procedure by telling him just what should
be observed and how to do so, pouring out information so premature as to be obnoxious, correcting
his taste, subduing his enthusiasm, and modifying even his behaviour. The tourist would presumably
pay off the unwelcome guide, but the children cannot pay off the teacher: they can and do rebel,
but docility and adaptability seem to play a large part in self-preservation. For the young
child freedom must precede docility, because the only reasonable and profitable docility is
one that comes after initiative and experiment have been satisfied, and when the child feels
that he needs help.

The world that the free child chooses represents every side of life that he is ready to assimilate,
and his freedom must be intellectual, emotional and moral freedom. In the school with the rigidly
organised time-table, where the remarks of the children provoke the constantly repeated reproach:
"We are not talking of that just now," where the apparatus is formal and the method of using
it prescribed, where home life and street life are ignored, where there are neither garden
nor picture books, where childish questions are passed over or hastily answered, where the
room is full of desks and the normal attitude is sitting, where the teacher is teaching more
often than the children are doing, there is no intellectual freedom.

Where passion and excitement are instantly arrested, where appreciation for strong colours,
fierce punishments, loud noises, is killed, where fear is ridiculed, where primitive likes
and dislikes are interpreted as coarseness, there is no emotional freedom. A child must have
these experiences if he is to come to his own later: this is not the time to stamp out but
only to deflect and guide; otherwise he becomes a weak and pale reflection of his elders, with
little resource or enthusiasm.

Where it is almost impossible to be openly naughty, where there is no opportunity for choice
or for making mistakes, where control is all from the teacher and self-control has no place,
there is no moral freedom. The school is not for the righteous but for the so-called sinner,
who is only a child learning self-control by experience.

Self-control is a habit gained through habits; a child must acquire the habit of arresting
desire, of holding the physical side in check, the habit of reflection, of choice, and most
of all the habit of either acting or holding back, as a result of all this. If in the earliest
years his will is in the hands of others, and he has the habit of obedience to the exclusion
of all other habits, then his development as a self-reliant individual is arrested, and may
be permanently weakened. There is no other way to learn life, and build up an ideal from the
raw material he has gained in other ways. In the rehearsal of life at school he can do this
without serious harm; but every time a mode of conduct is imposed upon him when he might have
chosen, every time he is externally controlled when he might have controlled himself, every
time he is balked in making a mistake that would have been experience to him, he will be proportionally
less fit to choose, to exercise self-control, to learn by experience, and these are the chief
lessons at this impressionable period.

The fourth principle therefore is that the atmosphere of freedom is the only atmosphere in
which a child can gain experiences that will help to develop character and control conduct.

These four vital principles will be applied to practical work in the following chapters.

II. PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF VITAL PRINCIPLES

Before applying these principles it is necessary for practical considerations to set out clearly
the various stages of this period. During the first eight years of life, development is very
rapid and not always relatively continuous. Sometimes it takes leaps, and sometimes appears
for a time to be quiescent. But roughly the first stage, of a child's developing life ends
when he can walk, eat more or less ordinary food, and is independent of his mother. At this
point the Nursery School stage begins: the child is learning for himself his world by experience,
and through play he chooses his raw material in an atmosphere of freedom. When the period of
play pure and simple begins to grow into a desire to do things better, to learn and practise
for a more remote end--in other words, when the child begins to be willing to be taught, the
transitional period from play to work begins. It can never be said to end, but the relative
amount of play to work gradually defines the life of the school: and so the transitional period
merges into the school period. Thus we are concerned first with the Nursery School period which
corresponds to what Froebel meant by his Kindergarten and Owen by his Infant School; secondly,
with the transitional period which has been far too long neglected or rushed over, and which
roughly corresponds to the Standard I. of the Elementary School; and thirdly, we have the beginnings
of the Junior School where work is the predominant factor. In spite of Shakespeare's assertion,
there is much in a name, and if these names were definitely adopted, teachers would realise
better the nature of their business.

The following chapters seek to apply practically the four vital principles to these periods
of a child's life, but in many cases the Transition Classes and the Junior School are considered
together.

The practical translation of this in the words of the teacher of to-day is, "I must choose
furniture, and requisition apparatus." The teacher of to-morrow will say to her children, "I
will bring the world into the school for you to learn." The Local Education Authority of to-day
says, "We must build a school for instruction." The Local Education Authority of to-morrow
will say, "We must make a miniature world for our children."

The world of the Nursery School child probably requires the most careful thought in this respect:
a large room with sunlight and air, low clear windows, a door leading to a garden and playground,
low cupboards full of toys, low-hung pictures, light chairs and tables that can be pushed into
a corner, stretcher beds equally disposable, a dresser with pretty utensils for food; these
are the chief requirements for satisfying physical needs, apparent in the actual room. Physical
habits will be considered later, under another heading.

Outside, in the playground, there should be opportunities for physical development, for its
own sake: swings, giant strides, ladders laid flat, slightly sloping planks, and a seesaw should
all be available for constant use; if the children are not warned or given constant advice
about their own safety, there is little fear of accidents.

Thus the purely physical side of the children is provided for, the side that they are, if healthy,
quite unconscious of; what else does experience demand at this stage?

Roughly classified, the raw experience of this stage may be divided into the experience of
the natural world of living things, the world of inanimate things, and the social world. For
the natural world there should be the garden outside, with its trees, grass and flower beds;
with its dovecot and rabbit hutch, and possibly a cat sunning herself on its paths; inside
there will be plants and flowers to care for; the elements, especially water, earth and air,
are very dear to a young child, and it is quite possible to satisfy his cravings with a large
sand-heap of dry and wet sand; a large flat bath for sailing boats and testing the theory of
sinking and floating; a bin of clay; a pair of bellows and several fans to set the air in motion.
There is always the fire to gaze at on the right side of the fire-guard, and appreciation of
the beauty of this element should be encouraged.

The world of inanimate things includes most of the toys that stimulate activity and give ideas.
The chief that should be found in the cupboards, round the walls, or scattered about the room,
are bricks of all sizes and shapes, skittles, balls and bats or rackets, hoops, reins, spades
and other garden tools; pails and patty pans for the sand-heap; pipes for bubbles, shells,
fir-cones, buttons, acorns, and any collection of small articles for handling; all kinds of
vehicles that can be pushed, such as carts, barrows, prams, engines; drums and other musical
instruments; materials for construction and expression, such as chalks, boards, paints and paper.

For experiences of the social world, which is not very real at this individualistic period,
come the dolls and doll's house, horses and stables, tea-things, cooking utensils, Noah's ark,
scales for a shop, boats, soldiers and forts: a very important item in this connection is the
collection of picture-books: they must be chosen with the greatest care, and only pictures
of such merit as those of Caldecott, Leslie Brooke and Jessie Wilcox Smith should be selected.
Pictures form one of the richest sources of experience at this stage, as indeed at any stage
of life, and truth, beauty and suggestiveness must be their chief factors.

The toys should be above all things durable, and if possible washable. Broken and dirty toys
make immoral children.

Besides the material surroundings there are opportunities, the seizing of which gives valuable
experiences. These belong to the social world, and lie chiefly in the training in life's social
observances and the development of good habits. This side of life is one of the most important
in the Nursery School, and needs material help. The lavatories and cloakrooms should be constructed
so that there is every chance for a child to become self-reliant and fastidious. The cloakrooms
should be provided with low pegs, boot holes, clothes brushes and shoe brushes: there should
be low basins with hot and cold water, enamel mugs and tooth brushes for each child, nail brushes,
plenty of towels, and where the district needs it, baths. The type provided by the Middlesex
Education Authority at Greenford Avenue School, Hanwell, gives a shower bath to a whole group
of children at once, thus making a more frequent bath possible. Perhaps for very small children
of the Nursery School age separate baths are more suitable. This is a question for future experience
on the part of teachers. There should be plenty of time for the children to learn to wash and
dress themselves.

In the school-room there should either be tablecloths, or the tables should be capable of being
scrubbed by the children after each meal. Their almost inevitable lack of manners at table
gives an invaluable opportunity for training, and again in such a case there should be no question
of haste. The meals should be laid, waited on and cleared away, and the dishes washed by the
children themselves, and they should be responsible for the general tidiness of the room. This
involves tea-cloths, mops, dusters, washing bowls, brushes and dustpans.

In the Transition Classes and Junior School the furniture and apparatus can be to a great extent
very much the same, their difference lying chiefly in degree. It is a pity to bring the age
of toys to an abrupt conclusion; in real life the older children still borrow the toys of the
younger ones while there are some definitely their own: such are, jigsaw and other puzzles,
dominoes, articles for dramatic representation, playing cards, toys for games of physical skill,
such as tops, kites, skipping ropes, etc. Such prepared constructive materials as meccano--and
a great mass of raw material for construction, generally termed "waste." There should be a
series of boxes or shelves where such waste products of the home, or of the woods, or of the
seashore, or of the shop, might be stored in some classified order: the collective instinct
is stronger than the more civilised habit of orderliness: here is an opportunity for developing
a habit from an instinct. There should also be materials for expression, such as clay, paper,
chalk, pencil, paints, weaving materials, cardboard, and scenery materials; and such tools
as scissors, cardboard knives, needlework tools, paste brushes, and others that may be necessary
and suitable. The rooms should be large and suitable for much moving about: the most usual
conditions should be a scattered class and not a seated listening class. This means light chairs
and tables or benches where handwork can be done; low cupboards and lockers so that each child
can get at his own things; broad window-sills for plants and flowers and a bookcase for reading
and picture books. Here again good picture-books are as essential as, even more essential than,
readers in the Transition Class. They will be a little more advanced than in the Nursery School,
and will be of the type of the Pied Piper illustrated, or pictures of children of other lands
and times. Some of Rackham's, of Harold Copping's, of the publications by Black in Peeps at
Many Lands, are suitable for this stage. Readers should be chosen for their literary value
from the recognised children's classics, such as the Peter Rabbit type, Alice in Wonderland,
Water-Babies, and not made up for the sake of reading practice.

The pictures on the walls should be hung at the right eye-level, and the windows low enough
for looking at the outside world--whatever it may be. The teacher's desk should be in a corner,
not in the central part of the room, for she must remember that the children are still in the
main seeking experience, not listening to the experience of another. They should have access
to the garden and playground, and all the incitements to activity should be there--similar
to those of the Nursery School, or those provided by the London County Council in parks. The
bare wilderness of playground now so familiar, where there is neither time nor opportunity
for children to be other than primitive savages, does not represent the outside world of beauty
and of adventure.

The lower classes of Junior School should differ very little in their miniature world. Life
is still activity to the child of eight, and consequently should contain no immovable furniture.
There will be more books, and the children may be in their seats for longer periods; the atmosphere
of guided but still spontaneous work is more definite, but the aim in choice of both furniture
and apparatus is still the gaining of experience of life, by direct contact in the main. Such
is the Requisition Sheet to be presented to the Stores Superintendent of the Local Education
Authority in the future, with an explanatory note stating that in a general way what is actually
required is the world in miniature!

Play is marked off from work chiefly by the absence of any outside pressure, and pleasure in
the activity is the characteristic of play pure and simple: if a child has forced upon him
a hint of any ulterior motive that may be in the mind of his teacher, the pleasure is spoilt
for him and the intrinsic value of the play is lost. In bringing children into school during
their play period, probably the most important formative period of their lives, and in utilising
their play consciously, we are interfering with one of their most precious possessions when
they are still too helpless to resent it directly. Too many of us make play a means of concealing
the wholesome but unwelcome morsel of information in jam, and we try to force it on the children
prematurely and surreptitiously, but Nature generally defeats us. The only sound thing to do
is to play the game for all it is worth, and recognise that in doing so education will look
after itself. To understand the nature of play, and to have the courage to follow it, is the
business of every teacher of young children. The Nursery School, especially if it consists
chiefly of children under five, presents at first very hard problems to the teacher; however
strong her belief in play may be, it receives severe tests. So much of the play at first seems
to be aimless running and shouting, or throwing about of toys and breaking them if possible,
so much quarrelling and fighting and weeping seem involved with any attempts at social life
on the part of the children; there seems very little desire to co-operate, and very little
desire to construct; as a rule, a child roams from one thing to another with apparently only
a fleeting attempt to play with it; yet on the other hand, to make the problem more baffling,
a child will spend a whole morning at one thing: quite lately one child announced that he meant
to play with water all day, and he did; another never left the sand-heap, and apparently repeated
the same kind of activity during a complete morning; visitors said in a rather disappointed
tone, "they just play all the time by themselves." One teacher brought out an attractive picture
and when a group of children gathered round it she proceeded to tell the story; they listened
politely for a few minutes, and then the group gradually melted away; they were not ready for
concentrated effort. If those children had been in the ordinary Baby Room of a school they
would have been quite docile, sitting in their places apparently listening to the story, amiably
"using" their bricks or other materials according to the teacher's directions, but they would
not, in the real sense, have been playing. This is an example of the need for both principle
and courage.

It is into this chaotic method of gaining experience that the teacher comes with her interpretive
power--she sees in it the beginnings of all the big things of life--and like a bigger child
she joins, and like a bigger child she improves. She sees in the apparent chaos an attempt
to get experience of the different aspects of life, in the apparently aimless activity an attempt
to realise and develop the bodily powers, in the fighting and quarrelling an attempt to establish
a place in social life. It is all unconscious on the part of a child, but a necessary phase
of real development.

Gradually the little primitive man begins to yield to civilisation. He is interested in things
for longer and asks for stories, music and rhymes, and what does this mean?

As he develops a child learns much about life in his care of the garden, about language in
his games, about human conduct from stories; but he does these things because he wants to do
them, and because there is a play need behind it all, which for him is a life need; in order
to build a straight wall he must classify his bricks, in order to be a real shopman he must
know his weights, in order to be a good workman he must measure his paper; all the ideas gained
from these things come to him along with sense activity; they are associated with the needs
and interests of daily life; and because of this he puts into the activity all the effort of
which he is capable, or as Dewey has expressed it, "the maximum of consciousness" into the
experience which is his play. This is real sense training, differing in this respect from the
training given by the Montessori material, which has no appeal to life interest, aims at exercising
the senses separately, and discourages play with the apparatus. It is activity without a body,
practice without an end, and nothing develops from it of a constructive or expressive nature.

In the nursery class therefore our curriculum is life, our apparatus all that a child's world
includes, and our method the one of joyful investigation, by means of which ideas and skill
are being acquired. The teacher is player in chief, ready to suggest, co-operate, supply information,
lead or follow as circumstances demand: responsibility must still belong to the children, for
while most of them know quite naturally how to play, there are many who will never get beyond
a rather narrow limit, through lack of experience or of initiative.

It is quite safe to let experience take its chance through play, but there are certain things
that must be dealt with quite definitely, when the teacher is not there as a playmate, but
as something more in the capacity of a mother. It is impossible to train all the habits necessary
at this time, through the spontaneous play, although incidentally many will be greatly helped
and made significant by it. If the children come from poor homes where speech is imperfect,
probably mere imitation of the teacher, which is the chief factor in ordinary language training,
will be insufficient. It will be necessary to invent ways, chiefly games, by which the vocal
organs may be used; this may be considered play, but it is more artificial and less spontaneous
than the informal activity already described. It is well to be clear as to the kind of exercises
best suited to make the vocal organs supple, and then to make these the basis of a game: for
example, little children constantly imitate the cries of ordinary life; town children could
dramatise a railway station where the sounds produced by engines and by porters give a valuable
training; they could imitate street cries, the sound of the wind, of motor hooters, sirens,
or of church bells. Country children could use the sounds of the farm-yard, the birds, or the
wind. In the recognition of sound, which is as necessary as its production, such a guessing
game could be taught as "I sent my son to be a grocer and the first thing he sold began with
s and ended with p," using the sounds, not names of the letters. For the acquisition of a vocabulary,
such a game as the Family Coach might be played and turned into many other vehicles or objects
about which many stories could be told. All the time the game must be played with the same
fidelity to the spirit of play as previously, but the introduction must be recognised as more
artificial and forced, and this can be justified because so many children are not normal with
regard to speech, and only where this is the case should language training be forced upon them.
Habits of courtesy, of behaviour at table, of position, of dressing and undressing, of washing
hands and brushing teeth, and many others, must all be taught, but taught at the time when
the need comes. Occasions will certainly occur during play, but the chances of repetition are
not sufficient to count on.

Thus we summarise the chief business of the Nursery School teacher when we say that it is concerned
chiefly with habits and play and right surroundings.

Play in the Transition Class is less informal. After the age of six certain ambitions grow
and must be satisfied. The aspects of life are more separated, and concentration on individual
ones is commoner; this means more separation into subjects, and thus a child is more willing
to be organised, and to have his day to some extent arranged for him. While in the nursery
class only what was absolutely necessary was fixed, in the Transition Class it is convenient
to fix rather more, for the sake of establishing certain regular habits, and because it is
necessary to give the freshest hours to the work that requires most concentration. We must
remember, however, that it is a transition class, and not set up a completely fashioned time-table
for the whole day. Reading and arithmetic must be acquired both as knowledge and skill, the
mother tongue requires definite practice, there must be a time for physical activity, and living
things must not be attended to spasmodically. Therefore it seems best that these things be
taken in the morning hours, while the afternoon is still a time for free choice of activity.

The following is a plan for the Transition Class, showing the bridge between absolute freedom
and a fully organised time-table--

           |       |and Number.|                   |

Granting this arrangement we must be clear how play as a method can still hold.

It does not hold in the informal incidental sense of the Nursery School: there are periods
in the Transition Class when the children know that they are working for a definite purpose
which is not direct play--as in reading; and there are times when they are dissatisfied with
their performances of skill and ask to be shown a better way, and voluntarily practise to secure
the end, as in handwork, arithmetic and some kinds of physical games. The remainder is probably
still pursued for its own sake. How then can this play spirit be maintained side by side with work?

First of all, the children should not be required to do anything without having behind it a
purpose that appeals to them; it may not be the ultimate purpose of "their good," but a secondary
reason may be given to which they will respond readily, generally the pretence reason. Arithmetic
to the ordinary person is a thing of real life; we count chiefly in connection with money,
with making things, with distributing things, or with arranging things, and we count carefully
when we keep scores in games; in adult life we seldom or never count or perform arithmetical
operations for sheer pleasure in the activity, but there are many children who do so in the
same spirit as we play patience or chess. And all this is our basis. The arithmetical activities
in the Transition Class should therefore be based on such everyday experiences as have been
mentioned, else there will be no associations made between the experiences of school and those
of life outside. The two must merge. There is no such thing as arithmetic pure and simple for
children unless they seek it; they must play at real life, and the real life that they are
now capable of appreciating.

Skill in calculation, accuracy and quickness can be acquired by a kind of practice that children
are quite ready for, if it comes when they realise the need; most children feel that their
power to score for games is often too slow and inaccurate; as store clerks they are uncertain
in their calculations; they will be willing to practise quick additions, subtractions, multiplications
and divisions, in pure arithmetical form, if the pretence purpose is clearly in view, which
to them is a real purpose; the same thing occurs in writing which should be considered a side
issue of reading; meaningless words or sentences are written wearily and without pains, but
to write the name of a picture you have painted, at the bottom of it, or to write something
that Cinderella's Godmother said, or bit by bit to write a letter, will be having a purpose
that gives life to an apparently meaningless act, and thoroughness to the effort.

In handwork, too, at this stage, practice takes an important place: a child is willing to hem,
to try certain brush strokes, to cut evenly, and later on to use his cardboard knife to effect
for the sake of a future result if he has already experimented freely. This is in full harmony
with the spirit of play, when we think of the practiced "strokes" and "throws" of the later
games, but it is a more advanced quality of play, because there is the beginning of a purpose
which is separated from immediate pleasure in the activity, there is the hint of an end in
view though it is a child's end, and not the adult or economic one.

The training of the mother tongue can be made very effective by means of games: in the days
when children's parties were simple, and family life was united, language games in the long
dark evenings gave to many a grip of words and expressions. Children learnt to describe accurately,
to be very fastidious in choice of words, to ask direct questions, to give verbal form to thought,
all through the stress of such games--Man and his Shadow, Clumps, Subject and Object, Russian
Scandal, the Minister's Cat, I see a Light, Charades, and acting of all kinds. No number of
picture talks, oral compositions, or observations can compete in real value with these games,
because behind them was a purpose or need for language that compelled the greatest efforts.

Physical development and its adjustment to mental control owes its greatest stimulus to games.
When physical strength, speed, or nimble adjustability is the pivot upon which the game depends,
special muscles are made subservient to will: behind the game there is the stimulus of strong
emotion, and here is the greatest factor in establishing permanent associations between body
and mind; psychologists see in many of these games of physical activity the evolution of the
race: drill pure and simple has its place partly in the same sense as "practice" in number
or handwork, and partly as a corrective to our fallacious system of education by listening,
instead of by activity: and we cannot in a lifetime acquire the powers of the race except by
concentrated practice. But no amount of drill can give the all-round experience necessary for
physical readiness for an emergency, physical and mental power to endure, active co-operation,
where self-control holds in check ambitious personal impulses: and no drill seems to give grace
and beauty of motion that the natural activity of dancing can give. It is through the games
that British children inherit, and by means of which they have unconsciously rehearsed many
of the situations of life, that they have been able to take their place readily in the life
of the nation and even to help to save it. Again, as in other directions, children must be
made to play the game in its thoroughness, for a well-played game gives the right balance to
the activities: drill is more specialised, and has specialisation for its end: a game calls
on the whole of an individual: he must be alert mentally and physically; and at the same time
the sense of fairness cannot be too strongly insisted on; no game can be tolerated as part
of education where there is looseness in this direction, from the skittles of the nursery class
to the cricket and hockey of the seventh standard, and nothing will so entirely outrage the
children's feelings as a teacher's careless arbitration. In physical games, too, the social
side is strongly developed: leadership, self-effacement and co-operation are more valuable
lessons of experience than fluent reading or neat writing or accurate additions: but they have
not counted as such in our economic system of education; they have taken their chance: few
inspectors ask to see whether children know how to "play the game," and yet they are so soon
to play the independent game of life. But the individual output of reading and sums of a sneaking
and cowardly, or assertive and selfish child, is as good probably as that of a child that has
the makings of a hero in him. And then we wonder at the propensities of the "lower classes."
It is because we have never made sure that they can play the game.

To summarise: play in the Nursery School stage is unorganised, informal, and pursued with no
motive but pleasure in the activity itself; it is mainly individual. Play in the Transition
Class is more definitely in the form of games, i.e. organised play, efforts of skill, mental
or physical; it becomes social. Play in the Junior School is almost an occasional method, because
the work motive is by this time getting stronger.

The next problem we have to solve is how to unify the bewildering variety of ideas and activities
that a child seeks contact with during a day. We found that the curriculum of the Infant School
of to-day presented a rather confusing variety of ideas, not necessarily arranged as the children
would have chosen; they would certainly not have chosen to break off some intense interest,
because an arbitrary timetable hurried them to something else, and they would have been right.
If we asked the children their reasons for choosing, we would find no clue except that they
chose what they wanted to, neither could they tell us why they spent so much more time over
one thing than another. If a similar study were to be made of a child from a slum also free
to arrange his day, we should find that while certain general features were the same others
would be different: he would ask for different stories, probably play different games, or the
same games in a different way, his back-yard would present different aspects, the things he
made would be different.

It is evident that the old correlation method has little or nothing to do with the matter;
a child may or may not draw the rabbit he feeds, he certainly does not play a rabbit game because
of the rabbit he has fed, nor does he build a rabbit-hutch with his bricks. He might try to
make a real one if the rabbit really needed it, but that arises out of an obvious necessity.
If he could put his unconscious promptings into words, he would say he did the things because
he wanted to, because somebody else did them, or because of something he saw yesterday, and
so on; but he would always refer back to himself. The central link in each case is in the child,
with his special store of experiences derived from his own particular surroundings; he brings
to new experiences his store of present experiences, his interests not always satisfied, his
powers variously used, he interprets the new by these, and seeks for more in the line of the
old. It is life he has experienced, and he seeks for more life.

How then can we secure for him that the new experiences presented to him in school will be
in line with the old? We will take three typical cases of children to illustrate the real nature
of this problem.

The first is the case of a child living in a very poor district of London or of any large town.
The school is presumably situated in a narrow street running off the High Street of the district,
the street where all the shopping is done; at the corner is a hide factory with an evil smell.
Most of the dwelling-houses abut on the pavement, some with a very small yard behind, some
without any. Several families live in one house, and often one room is all a family can afford;
as that has to be paid for in advance the family address may change frequently. The father
may be a dock labourer with uncertain pay, a coster, a rag and bone merchant, or he may follow
some unskilled occupation of a similarly precarious nature; in consequence the mother has frequently
to do daily work, the home is locked up till evening, and she often leaves before the children
start for morning school. It is a curious but very common fact that, free though these children
are, they know only a very small radius around their own homes. They are accustomed to be sent
shopping into High Street, where household stores are bought in pennyworths or twopennyworths,
owing to uncertain finance and no storage accommodation. Generally there is one tap and one
sink in the basement for the needs of all the families in the house. There is usually a park
somewhere within reach, but it may be a mile away; in it would, at least, be trees, a pond,
grass, flowers. But an excursion there, unless it is undertaken by the school, can only be
hoped for on a fine Bank Holiday; there is neither time nor money to go on a Saturday, and
Sunday cannot be said to begin till dinner-time, about 3 P.M., when the public-houses close,
and the father comes home to dinner.

It is difficult to imagine the conversation of such a household; family life exists only on
Sunday at dinner-time; the child's background of family life is a room which is at once a bedroom,
living room and laundry. There is nearly always some part of a meal on the table, and some
washing hanging up. Outside there are the dingy street, the crowded shops, the pavement to
play on, and both outside and in, the bleaker and more sordid aspects of life, sometimes miserable,
sometimes exciting. On Saturday night the lights are brilliant and life is at least intense.
Bed is a very crowded affair, in which many half-undressed children sleep covered with the
remainder of the day's wardrobe.

What store of experiences does a child from such a neighbourhood bring to school, to be assimilated
with the new experiences provided there? What do such terms as home, dinner, bed, bath, birth,
death, country, mean to him? They mean something.[34]

[Footnote 34: See Child Life, October 1916.]

Not a mile away we may come to a very respectable suburb of the average type; and what is said
of it may apply in some degree to a provincial or country town or, at least, the application
can easily be made. The school probably stands at the top corner of a road of houses rented,
at £25 to £35 per annum, with gardens in front and behind. The road generally runs into a main
road with shops and traffic. Here and there in the residential road are little oases of shops,
patronised by the neighbourhood, and some of the children may live over these. The home life
is more ordinary and needs less descriptive detail, but there are some features that must be
considered. The decencies, not to say refinements of eating, sleeping and washing are taken
for granted: there is often a bath-room and always a kitchen. The father's occupation may be
local, but a good many fathers will go to town; there is generally a family holiday to the
sea, or less often to the country. In the house the degree of refinement varies; there are
nearly always pictures of a sort, books of a sort, and the children are supplied with toys
of a sort. They visit each other's houses, and the observances of social life are kept variously.
Often the horizon is very narrow; the mother's interest is very local and timid; the father's
business life may be absolutely apart from his home life and never mentioned there. The family
conversation while quite amiable and agreeable may be round very few topics, and the vocabulary,
while quite respectable, may be most limited. Children's questions may be put aside as either
trivial or unsuitable. In one sense the slum child may be said to have a broader background,
the realities of life are bare to him on their most sordid side, there is neither mystery nor
beauty around life, or death, or the natural affections. The suburban child may on the contrary
be balked and restricted so that unnecessary mystery gives an unwholesome interest to these
things and conventionality a dishonest reserve.

A suburb of this type is described by Beresford in Housemates:--"In such districts (as Gospel
Oak) I am depressed by the flatness of an awful monotony. The slums vex me far less. There
I find adventure and jest whatever the squalor; the marks of the primitive struggle through
dirt and darkness towards release. Those horrible lines of moody, complacent streets represent
not struggle, but the achievement of a worthless aspiration. The houses, with their deadly
similarity, their smug, false exteriors, their conformity to an ideal which is typified by
their poor imitative decoration, could only be inhabited by people who have no thought or desire
for expression.... The dwellers in such districts are cramped into the vice of their environment.
Their homes represent the dull concession to a state rule; and their lives take tone from the
grey, smoke-grimed repetition of one endlessly repeated design. The same foolish ornamentation
on every house reiterates the same suggestion. Their places of worship, the blank chapels and
pseudo-Gothic churches rear themselves head and shoulders above the dull level, only to repeat
the same threat of obedience to a gloomy law.... The thought of Gospel Oak and its like is
the thought of imitation, of imitation falling back and becoming stereotyped, until the meaning
of the thing so persistently copied has been lost and forgotten."

A third case is that of the country child, the child who attends the village school. Many villages
lie several miles from a railway station, so that the younger children may not see a railway
train more than once or twice a year. The fathers may be engaged in village trades, such as
a shoemaker, carpenter, gardener, general shop merchant, farm labourer, or farmer. The village
houses are often cramped and small, but there is wholesome space outside, and generally a good
garden which supplies some of the family food; milk and eggs are easily obtainable, and conditions
of living are seldom as crowded as in a town. The country children see more of life in complete
miniature than the slum or the suburban child can do, for the whole life of the village lies
before him. The school is generally in the centre, with a good playground, and of late years
a good school garden is frequent. The village church, generally old, is another centre of life,
and there is at least the vicarage to give a type of life under different social conditions.

The home intellectual background may vary, but on the whole cannot be reckoned on very much;
though in some ways it is more narrow than the suburban one, it is often less superficial.
In a different way from the slum child, but none the less definitely, the country child comes
face to face with the realities of life, in a more natural and desirable way than either of
the others. It is difficult to estimate some of the effects of living in the midst of real
nature on children; unconsciously, they acquire much deep knowledge impossible to learn through
nature study, however good, a kind of knowledge that is part of their being; but how far it
affects them emotionally or enters into their scheme of life, is hard to say. As they grow
up much of it is merely economic acquirement: if they are to work on the land, or rear cattle,
or drive a van through the country, it is all to the good; but one thing is noticeable, that
they take very quickly to such allurements of town life as a cinema, or a picture paper or
gramophone, and this points to unsatisfied cravings of some sort, not necessarily so unworthy
or superficial as the means sought to satisfy them.

From these rather extreme cases we get near the solution of the problem; it is quite evident
that each of these children brings to school very different contributions of experience on
which to build, though their general needs and interests are similar. Therefore the curriculum
of the school will depend on the general surroundings and circumstances of the children, and
all programmes of work and many questions of organisation will be built on this. The model
programme so dear to some teachers must be banished, as a doctor would banish a general prescription;
no honest teacher can allow this part of her work to be done for her by any one else.

Therefore the central point is the child's previous experience, and on this the experience
provided by school, i.e. curriculum and subject matter, depends. One or two examples of the
working out of this might make the application clearer. Probably the realities of life in relation
to money differ greatly. The kind of problem presented to the poor town child will deal with
shopping in pennyworths or ounces, with getting coals in pound bagfuls. Clothes are generally
second-hand, and so ordinary standard prices are out of the question. Bread is bought stale
and therefore cheaper, early in the morning. Preserved milk only is bought, and that in halfpenny
quantities. Only problems based on these will be real to this child at first.

The suburban child's economic experience may be based on his pocket-money, money in the bank,
and the normal shopping of ordinary life.

The country child is frequently very ignorant of money values; probably it will be necessary
to take the country general shop as the basis. He could also begin to estimate the produce
of the school garden.

THE NURSERY SCHOOL PROGRAMME

It is quite obvious from the nature of play at this stage that a time-table is out of the question
and in fact an outrage against nature. Only for social convenience and for the establishment
of certain physical habits can there be fixed hours. There must be approximate limits as to
the times of arrival and departure, but nothing of the nature of marking registers to record
exact minutes. Little children sometimes sleep late, or, on the other hand, the mothers may
have to leave home very early; all this must be allowed for. There should be fixed times for
meals and for sleep, and these should be rigidly observed, and there should be regular times
for the children to go to the lavatories; all these establish regularity and self-control,
as well as improving general health. But anything in the nature of story periods, games periods,
handwork periods, only impedes the variously developing children in their hunger for experiences.

Their curriculum is life as the teacher has spread it out before them; there are no subjects
at this stage; the various aspects ought to be of the nature of a glorious feast to these young
children. Traherne says in the seventeenth century:--

"Will you see the infancy of this sublime and celestial greatness?

If this is what life means to the young child, and Traherne only records what many of us have
forgotten there is little need for interference: we can only spread the feast and stand aside
to watch for opportunities.

The following extract is given from a teacher's note-book: it shows how many possibilities
open out to a teacher, and how impossible it is to keep to a time-table, or even to try to
name the activities. The children concerned were about five years old, newly admitted to a
poor school in S.E. London. The records are selected from a continuous period, and do not apply
to one day:--

PLANS FOR THE DAY                        WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

Number Occupations.--This will    The children played, freely
be entirely free and the children        chalking most of the time; those
will choose their own toys and           threading beads were most
put them away.                           interested. Again I noticed the
                                         lack of idea of colour; I found
                                         one new boy placing his sticks
                                         according to colour, without
                                         knowing the names of the colours.
                                         The boys thought the soldiers
                                         belonged to them, and laughed at
                                         a little girl for choosing them.

Language Training.--I have        I realised this was a failure,
discovered that they love to             for I asked the children to use
imitate sounds, so we will play          their boards and chalks for a
at this. They could draw a cat           definite drawing, and they should
and say "miauw," and a duck and          have had the time to use them
say "quack." They could also             freely and discover their use. I
imitate the wind.                        got very little information about
                                         their vocabulary.

Language Training (another     I found that many children
day).--I shall try to induce the     pronounced words so strangely
children to speak to me about their      that I could only with difficulty
homes, in order to discover any          recognise them. One said she
difficulties of pronunciation and        had a "bresser" with "clates"
to make them more fluent.                on it and "knies" Others spoke
                                         of "manckle," "firebrace," "forts."
                                         One child speaking of curly hair
                                         called it "killeyer." We had no
                                         time for the story.

Playing with Toys.--The           Noah's arks, dolls, and bricks
children will choose their own toys,     were used, and I found that the
and as far as possible I will put        girls who had no dolls at home
a child who knows how to use them        were delighted to be able to dress
next to one who desires to sit           and undress them and put them
still.                                   to bed. One little girl walked
                                         backwards and forwards before
                                         the class getting her doll to
                                         sleep; the boys were making a
                                         noise with their arks and she
                                         remarked on this, so we induced
                                         them to be silent while the dolls
                                         were put to sleep. The boys
                                         arranged their animals in long
                                         lines. The bricks were much more
                                         carefully put away to-day.

THE TRANSITION AND THE JUNIOR SCHOOL PROGRAMME

Even after the Nursery School period much of the curriculum and subject matter is in the hands
of the children themselves, though the relative proportions will vary according to the children's
experiences. It is pretty evident to the honest-minded teacher that the subjects are, in school
terms, nature work and elementary science, mathematics, constructive and expressive work, literature,
music, language, physical exercise and religion. The business of the younger child is with
real things and activity, not with symbols and passivity, therefore he is not really in need
of reading, writing, or arithmetic. We hear arguments from ambitious teachers that children
are fond of reading lessons because they enjoy the fantasies in which these lessons are wrapped,
or the efforts made by the teacher to create interest; we hear that children ask to be taught
to read; they also ask to be taught to drive a tram or to cook a dinner; but it is all part
of the pretence game of playing at being grown up. They do not need to read while stories and
poetry can be told or read to them; they are not ready to make the effort of working for a
remote economic end, where there is no real pleasure in the activity, and no opportunity of
putting their powers to use. No child under six wants to sit down and read, and it would be
very harmful if he did; his business is with real things and with his vocabulary, which is
not nearly ready to put into symbols yet. If reading is delayed, hours of weary drudgery will
be saved and energy stored for more precious attainments.

Therefore in the transition class (i.e. children over six at lowest) the only addition to the
curriculum already set out for the nursery class, would be arithmetic and reading, including
writing. The other differences would be in degree only. In the junior class (with children
over seven at lowest) a desire to know something of the doings of people in other countries,
to hear about other parts of our own land, will lead to the beginnings of geography; while
with this less imaginative and more literal period comes the request for stories that are more
verbally true, and questions about origins, leading to the beginnings of history.

It is very much easier to give the general curriculum than to deal with the choice of actual
material, because that is involved largely with the principle of the unity of experience, and,
as we know, experiences vary. The normal town and country child, and the abnormal child of
poverty have all certain human cravings in common, and these are provided for in the aspects
of life or subjects that have been named--but this is far too general an application to be
the end of the matter; each subject has many sides to offer. There may be for example the pottery
town, the weaving town, the country town, the fishing town, the colliery town: in the country
there is the district of the dairy farmer, of the sheep farmer, of the grain grower and miller,
of the fruit farmer, of the hop grower, and many districts may partake of more than one characteristic.
Perhaps the most curious anomaly of experience is that of the child of the London slums who
goes "hopping" into some of the loveliest parts of Kent, in early autumn. And so in a general
way at least the concentrated experience of school must fill gaps and supply experiences that
life has not provided for.

One of the pottery towns in Staffordshire is built on very unfertile clay; there are several
potteries in the town belching out smoke, and, in addition, rows of monotonous smoke-blackened
houses; almost always a yellow pall of smoke hangs over the whole district, and even where
the edge of the country might begin, the grass and trees are poor and blackened, and distant
views are seen through a haze. There are almost no gardens in the town, and very little attempt
has been made to beautify it, because the results are so disappointing. Beauty, therefore,
in various forms must be a large part of the curriculum: already design is a common interest
in the pottery museums of the district, and this could be made a motive for the older children;
but in the Junior and Nursery School pictures of natural beauty, wild flowers if it is possible
to get them, music, painting and drawing, and literature should bulk largely enough to make
a permanent impression on the children. In a very remote country village where life seems to
go slowly, and days are long, children should be encouraged, by means of the school influence,
to make things that absorb thought and interest, to tell and hear stories. Storytelling in
the evening round the fire is a habit of the past, and might well supply some of the cravings
that have to be satisfied by the "pictures." Most of us have to keep ourselves well in hand
when we listen to a recitation in much the same way as when a slate pencil used to creak; it
would be very much better if the art of storytelling were cultivated at school, encouraged
at home, and applied to entertainments. Indeed the entertainments of a village school, instead
of being the unnatural and feverish production of hours of overtime, might well be the ordinary
outcome of work both at school and at home--and thus a motive for leisure is naturally supplied
and probably a hobby initiated.

It is profitable sometimes to group the subjects of experience in order to preserve balance.
All getting of experience is active, but some kinds more obviously than others. Undoubtedly
in hearing stories and poetry, in watching a snail or a bee, in listening to music, the activity
is mental rather than physical and assimilation of ideas is more direct; in discovering experiences
by means of construction, expression, experiment or imitation, assimilation is less direct
but often more permanent and secure. Froebel discriminates between impression and expression,
or taking in and giving out, and although he constantly emphasised that the child takes in
by giving, it is convenient to recognise this distinction. Another helpful grouping is the
more objective one. Some subjects refer more particularly to human conduct, the enlargement
of experiences of human beings, and the building up of the ideal: these are literature, music,
history and geography; others refer to life other than that of human beings, commonly known
as nature study and science; others to the properties of inanimate things, and to questions
throughout all life of measurement, size and force--this is known as mathematics; others of
the life behind the material and the spiritual world--this is known as religion.

The principle of Freedom underlies all the activities of the school and does not refer to conduct
simply; intellectual and emotional aspects of discipline are too often ignored and we have
as a product the commonplace, narrow, imitative person, too timid or too indolent to think
a new thought, or to feel strongly enough to stand for a cause. Self-control is the goal of
discipline, but independent thinking, enthusiasm and initiative are all included in the term.

It will be well to discriminate between the occasions, both in the Nursery School and in the
transition and junior classes, when a child should be free to learn by experience and when
he should be controlled from without. We shall probably find occasions which partake of the
nature of each.

The Nursery School is a collection of individuals presumably from 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 years of age.
They know no social life beyond the family life, and family experience is relative to the size
of the family. In any case they have not yet measured themselves against their peers, with
the exception of the occasional twin. A few months ago about twenty children of this description
formed the nucleus of a new Nursery School where, as far as possible, the world in miniature
was spread out before them, and they were guided in their entrance to it by an experienced
teacher and a young helper. For the first few weeks the chief characteristic was noise; the
children rushed up and down the large room, shouting, and pushing any portable toys they could
find. One little boy of 2-1/2 employed himself in what can only be called "punching" the other
children, snatching their possessions away from them and responding to the teacher by the law
of contra-suggestion. He was the most intelligent child in the school. He generally left a
line of weeping children behind him, and several began to imitate him. The pugnacious instinct
requires little encouragement. Lunch was a period of snatching, spilling, and making plans
to get the best. Many of the toys provided were carelessly trampled upon and broken: requests
to put away things at the end of the day were almost unavailing.

When the time for sleeping came in the afternoon many of the children refused to lie down:
some consented but only to sing and talk as they lay. Only one, a child of 2-1/2, slept, because
he cried himself to sleep from sheer strangeness. This apparently unbeautiful picture is only
the first battle of the individual on his entrance to the life of the community.

On the other hand, there were intervals of keen joy: water, sand and clay chiefly absorbed
the younger children: the older ones wanted to wash up and scrub, and many spent a good deal
of time looking at picture-books. This was the raw material for the teacher to begin with:
the children came from comfortable suburban homes: none were really poor, and many had known
no privation. They were keen for experiences and disposed to be very friendly to her.

After five months there is a marked difference in spirit. The noise is modified because the
children found other absorbing interests, though at times nature still demands voice production.
During lunch time and sleeping time there is quiet, but the teacher has never asked for silence
unless there was some such evident reason. There is no silence game. The difference has come
from within the children. All now lie down in the afternoon quietly, and the greater number
sleep; but there has been no command or any kind of general plan: again the desire has gradually
come to individuals from suggestion and imitation. Lunch is quite orderly, but not yet without
an occasional accident or struggle. There is much less fighting, but primitive man is still
there. The most marked development is in the growth of the idea of "taking turns"; the children
have begun to master this all-important lesson of life. The strong pugnacious habit in the
little punching boy reached a point that showed he was unable to conquer it from within: about
two months after his arrival the teacher consulted his mother, who confirmed all that the teacher
had experienced: her prescription was smacking. After a good deal of thought and many ineffectual
talks and experiments with the boy, the teacher came to the conclusion that the mother was
right: she took him to the cloakroom after the next outbreak and smacked his hands: he was
surprised and a little hurt, but very soon forgot and continued his practices: on the next
occasion the teacher repeated the punishment and it was never again necessary. For a few days
he was at a loss for an occupation because punching had become a confirmed habit, but soon
other interests appealed to him: he has never changed in his trust in his teacher of whom he
is noticeably very fond, and he has now realised that he must control a bad habit. This example
has been given at length to illustrate the relation of government to freedom.

If these children had been in the ordinary Baby Room, subject to a time-table, to constant
plans by the teacher for their activities, few or none of these occasions would have occurred:
the incipient so-called naughtiness would have been displayed only outside, in the playground
or at home: there would have been little chance of chaos, of fighting, of punching, of trying
to get the best thing and foremost place, there would have been little opportunity for choice
and less real absorption, because of the time-table. The children would have been happy enough,
but they would not have been trained to live as individuals. Outward docility is a fatal trait
and very common in young children; probably it is a form of self-preservation. But the real
child only lies in wait to make opportunities out of school. The school is therefore not preparing
him for life.

       *       *       *       *       *

Freedom in the transition and the junior school must be differently applied: individual life
begins to merge into community life, and the children begin to learn that things right for
individuals may be wrong for the community. But the problem of freedom is not as easy as the
problem of authority: standards must be greatly altered and outward docility no longer mistaken
for training in self-control. Individual training cannot suddenly become class discipline,
neither can children be switched from the Nursery School to a full-blown class system.

The idea of class teaching must be postponed, for out of it come most of the difficulties of
discipline, and it is not the natural arrangement at this transitional period. A teacher is
imposing on a number of very different individuals a system that says their difficulties are
alike, that they must all work at one rate and in one way: and so we have the weary "reading
round" class, when the slow ones struggle and the quick ones find other and unlawful occupation:
we have the number lessons broken by the teacher's breathless attempts to see that all the
class follows: we have the handwork that imposes an average standard of work that fits nobody
exactly. Intellectual freedom can only come by individual or group work, while class teaching
is only for such occasions as a literature or a singing lesson, or the presentation of an occasional
new idea in number. Individual and group work need much organisation, but while classes consist
of over forty children there is no other way to permit intellectual and moral freedom. Of course
the furniture of the room will greatly help to make this more possible, and it is hoped that
an enlightened authority will not continue to supply heavy iron-framed desks for the junior
school, those described as "desks for listening."

The prevailing atmosphere should be a busy noise and not silence--it should be the noise of
children working, oftener than of the teacher teaching, i.e. teaching the whole class. The
teacher should be more frequently among the children than at her desk, and the children's voices
should be heard more often than hers.

Such children will inevitably become intellectually independent and morally self-controlled.
Most of the order should be taken in hand by children in office, and they should be distinguished
by a badge: most questions of punishment should be referred to them. This means a constant
appeal to the law that is behind both teacher and children and which they learn to reach apart
from the teacher's control.

"Where 'thou shalt' of the law becomes 'I will' of the doer, then we are free."

III. CONSIDERATION OF THE ASPECTS OF EXPERIENCE

The aim of the following chapters is to show how principles may be applied to what are usually
known as subjects of the curriculum, and what place these subjects take in the acquisition
of experience. An exhaustive or detailed treatment of method is not intended, but merely the
establishment of a point of view and method of application.

CHAPTER XXI

EXPERIENCES OF HUMAN CONDUCT

It is always difficult to see the beginnings of things: we know that stories form the raw material
of morality, it is not easy to trace morality in Little Black Sambo, The Three Bears, Alice
in Wonderland, or The Sleeping Beauty, but nevertheless morality is there if we recognise morality
in everyday things. It is not too much to say that everybody should have an ideal, even a burglar:
his ideal is to be a good and thorough burglar, and probably if he is a burglar of the finer
sort, it is to play fair to the whole gang. It is better to be a burglar with an ideal than
a blameless person with very little soul or personality, who just slides through life accepting
things: it is better to have a coster's ideal of a holiday than to be too indifferent or stupid
to care or to know what you want.

Now ideals are supposed to be the essence of morality and morality comes to us through experience,
and only experience tests its truth. The story with a moral is generally neither literature
nor morality, except such unique examples as The Pilgrim's Progress or Everyman. The kind of
experience with which morality is concerned is experience of human life in various circumstances,
and the way people behave under those circumstances. The beginning of such experience is our
own behaviour and the behaviour of other people we know, but this is too limited an experience
to produce a satisfactory ideal; so we crave for something wider. It is curious how strong
is the craving for this kind of experience in all normal children, in whom one would suppose
sense experiences and especially muscular experiences to be enough. The need to know about
people other than ourselves, and yet not too unlike, in circumstances other than our own, and
yet not too strange, seems to be a necessary part of our education, and we interpret it in
the light of our own personal conduct. Out of this, as well as out of our direct experience,
we build our ideal. When one realises how an ideal may colour the whole outlook of a person,
one begins to realise what literature means to a child. The early ideal is crude; it may be
Jack the Giant-Killer, or an engine-driver, Cinderella, or the step-cleaner; this may grow
into Hiawatha or Robinson Crusoe, for boys, and a fairy tale Princess or one of the "Little
Women" for girls. In every hero a child half-unconsciously sees himself, and the ideal stimulates
all that hidden life which is probably the most important part of his growth. As indirect experiences
grow, or in other words as he hears or reads more stories, his ideal widens, and his knowledge
of the problems of life is enlarged. This is the raw material of morality, for out of his answers
to these problems he builds up standards of conduct and of judgement. He projects himself into
his own ideal, and he projects himself into the experiences of other people: he lives in both:
this is imagination of the highest kind, it is often called sympathy, but the term is too limited,
it is rather imaginative understanding.

There is another side of life grasped by means of this new world of experience, and that is,
the spiritual side that lies between conduct and ideals; children have always accepted the
supernatural quite readily and it is not to be wondered at, for all the world is new and therefore
supernatural to them. Magic is done daily in children's eyes, and there is no line between
what is understandable and what is not, until adults try to interpret it for them.

They are curious about birth and death and all origins: thunder is terrifying, the sea is enthralling,
the wind is mysterious, the sky is immense, and all suggest a power beyond: in this the children
are reproducing the race experience as expressed in myths, when power was embodied in a god
or goddess. Therefore the fairy world or the giant world, or the wood full of dwarfs and witches'
houses, is as real to them, and as acceptable, as any part of life. It is their recognition
of a world of spirits which later on mingles itself with the spiritual life of religion. That
life is behind all matter, is the main truth they hold, and while it is difficult here to disentangle
morality from religion, it is supremely evident that a very great and significant side of a
child's education is before us.

It is by means of the divine gift of imagination, probably the most spiritual of a child's
gifts, that he can lay hold of all that the world of literature has to offer him. Because of
imagination he is independent of poverty, monotony, and the indifference of other people; he
has a world of his own in which nothing is impossible. Edwin Pugh says of a child of the slums
who was passionately fond of reading cheap literature:--"It was by means of this penny passport
to Heaven that she escaped from the Hell of her surroundings. It was in the maudlin fancies
of some poor besotted literary hack maybe, that she found surcease from the pains of weariness,
the carks and cares of her miserable estate."

A teacher realising this, should feel an almost unspeakable sense of responsibility in having
to select and present matter: but the problem should be solved on the one hand by her own high
standard of story material, and on the other by her knowledge of the child's needs. According
to his experiences of life the interpretation of the story will differ: for example, it was
found that the children of a low slum neighbourhood translated Jack the Giant-killer into terms
of a street fight: to children living by a river or the sea, the Water-Babies would mean very
much, while Jan of the Windmill would be more familiar ground for country children. Fairy stories
of the best kind have a universal appeal.

In choosing a story a teacher should be aware of the imperishable part of it, the truth around
which it grew; sometimes the truth may seem a very commonplace one, sometimes a curious one.
For example, very young children generally prefer stories of home life because round the family
their experience gathers: the subject seems homely, but it is really one of the fundamental
things of life and the teacher should realise this in such a way that the telling or reading
of the story makes the kernel its central point. To some children the ideal home life comes
only through literature: daily experiences rather contradict it. Humour is an important factor
in morality; unless a person is capable of seeing the humor of a situation he is likely to
be wanting in a sense of balance; the humor of a situation is often caused by the wrong proportion
or wrong balance of things: for example the humour of The Mad Tea-Party lies, partly at least,
in the absurd gravity with which the animals regarded the whole situation, the extreme literal-mindedness
of Alice, and the exaggerated imitation of human beings: a really moral person must have balance
as well as sympathy, else he sees things out of proportion. These examples make evident that
we are not to seek for anything very patently high-flown in the stories for children; it is
life in all its phases that gives the material, but it must be true life: not false or sentimental
or trivial life: this will rule out the "pretty" stories for children written by trivial people
in teachers' papers, or the pseudo-nature story, or the artificial myth of the "How did" type,
or the would-be childish story where the language is rather that of the grown-up imitating
children than that of real children. Of late years, with the discovery of children, children's
literature has grown, and there is a good deal to choose from past and present writers.

There is no recognised or stereotyped method of telling a story to children: it is something
much deeper than merely an acquired art, it is the teacher giving something of her personality
to the children, something that is most precious. One of the finest of our English Kindergarten
teachers once said, "I feel almost as if I ought to prepare my soul before telling a story
to young children," and this is the sense in which the story should be chosen and told. There
are, of course, certain external qualifications which must be so fully acquired as to be used
unconsciously, such as a good vocabulary, power over one's voice, a recognition of certain
literary phases in a story, such as the working up to the dramatic crisis, the working down
to the end so that it shall not fall flat, and the dramatic touches that give life; these are
certainly most necessary, and should be studied and cultivated; but a teacher should not be
hampered in her telling by being too conscious of them. Rather she should feel such respect
and even reverence for this side of a child's education that the framework and setting can
only be of the best, always remembering at the same time what is framework and setting, and
what is essence.

Much that has been said about the method and aim of stories might apply to those taken from
the Bible, but they need certain additional considerations. Here religion and morality come
very closely together: the recognition of a definite personality behind all circumstances of
life, to whom our conduct matters, gives a soul to morality. The Old Testament is a record
of the growth of a nation more fully conscious of God than is the record of any other nation,
and because of this children can understand God in human life when they read such stories as
the childhood of Moses and of Samuel. Children resemble the young Jewish nation in this respect:
they accept the direct intervention of God in the life of every day. Their primitive sense
of justice, which is an eye for an eye, will make them welcome joyfully the plagues of Egypt
and the crossing of the Red Sea. It would be premature to force on them the more mature idea
of mercy, which would probably lead to confusion of judgement: they must be clear about the
balance of things before they readjust it for themselves.

Much of the material in the Old Testament is hardly suitable for very young children, but the
most should be made of what there is: the lives of Eastern people are interesting to children
and help to make the phraseology of the Psalms and even of the narratives clear to them. Wonder
stories such as the Creation, the Flood, the Burning Bush, Elijah's experiences, appeal to
them on another side, the side that is eager to wonder: the accounts of the childhood of Ishmael,
Isaac, Joseph, Moses, David and Samuel, and the little Syrian maid, come very close to them.
Such stories should be given to young children so that they form part of the enchanted memory
of childhood--which is permanent.

With the New Testament the problem is more difficult: one hesitates to bring the life of Christ
before children until they are ready to understand, even in some degree, its significance;
the subject is apt to be dealt with either too familiarly, and made too commonplace and everyday
a matter, or as something so far removed from human affairs as to be mysterious and remote
to a child. To mix Old and New Testament indiscriminately, as, for example, by taking them
on alternate days, is unforgivable, and no teacher who has studied the Bible seriously could
do so, if she cared about the religious training of her children, and understood the Bible.

If the children can realise something of the sense in which Christ helped human beings, then
some of the incidents in His life might be given, such as His birth, His work of healing, feeding
and helping the poor, and some of His stories, such as the lost sheep, the lost son, the sower,
the good Samaritan. It is difficult to speak strongly enough of the mistreatment of Scripture,
under the name of religion: it has been spoilt more than any other subject in the curriculum,
chiefly by being taken too often and too slightly, by teachers who may be in themselves deeply
religious, but who have not applied intelligence to this matter. The religious life of a young
child is very direct: there is only a little in the religious experiences of the Jews that
can help him, and much that can puzzle and hinder him; their interpretation of God as revengeful,
cruel and one-sided in His dealings with their enemies must greatly puzzle him, when he hears
on the other hand that God is the Father of all the nations on the earth. What is suitable
should be taken and taken well, but there is no virtue in the Bible misunderstood.

Poetry is a form of literature which appeals to children if they are not made to learn it by
rote. Unconsciously they learn it very quickly and easily, if they understand in a general
way the meaning, and if they like the sound of the words. Rhythm is an early inheritance and
can be encouraged by poetry, music and movement. The sound of words appeals strongly to young
children, and rhyming is almost a game. The kind of poetry preferred varies a good deal but
on the whole narrative or nonsense verses seem most popular; few children are ready for sentiment
or reflection even about themselves, and this is why some of Stevenson's most charming poems
about children are not appreciated by them as much as by grown-up people. And for the same
reason only a few nature poems are really liked.

Without doubt, the only aim in giving poetry to children is to help them to appreciate it,
and the only method to secure this is to read it to them appreciatively and often.

Besides such anthologies as The Golden Staircase, E.V. Lucas's Book of Verses for Children,
and others, we must go to the Bible for poems like the Song of Miriam, or of Deborah, and the
Psalms; to Shakespeare for such songs as "Where the Bee Sucks," "I know a Bank," "Ye Spotted
Snakes," either with or without music; to Longfellow's Hiawatha for descriptive pieces, and
to Scott and Tennyson for ballads and songs, and to many other simple classic sources outside
the ordinary collections.

In both prose and poetry, probably the ultimate aim is appreciation of beauty in human conduct.
Clutton Brock says, "The value of art is the value of the aesthetic activity of the spirit,
and we must all value that before we can value works of art rightly: and ultimately we must
value this glory of the universe, to which we give the name of beauty when we apprehend it."

If all this is what literature means in a child's experiences of life, then it must be given
a worthy place in the time-table and curriculum and in the serious preparation by the teacher
for her work.

CHAPTER XXII

EXPERIENCES OF THE NATURAL WORLD

The first experiences the child gains from the world of nature are those of beauty, of sound,
colour and smell. Flowers at first are just lovely and sweet-smelling; the keen senses of a
child are more deeply satisfied with colour and scent than we have any idea of, unless some
faint memory of what it meant remains with us. But he begins to grasp real scientific truth
from his experiences with the elements which have for him such a mysterious attraction; by
the very contact with water something in the child responds to its stimulus. Mud and sand have
their charms, quite intangible, but universal, from prince to coster; a bonfire is something
that arouses a kind of primeval joy. Again, race experience reproducing itself may account
for all this, and it must be satisfied. The demand for contact with the rest of nature is a
strong and fierce part of human nature, and it means the growth of something in life that we
cannot do without. We induce children to come into our schools when this hunger is at its fiercest,
and very often we do nothing to satisfy it, but set them in rooms to look at things inanimate
when their very being is crying out for life. "I want something and I don't know what to want"
is the expression of a state very frequent in children, and not infrequent in grown-up people,
because they have been balked of something.

How, then, can we provide for their experience of this side of life? We have tried to do so
in the past by object and nature lessons, but we must admit that they are not the means by
which young children seek to know life, or by which they appreciate its beauty. We have been
trying to kill too many birds with one stone in our economic way; "to train the powers of observation,"
"to teach a child to express himself," "to help a child to gain useful knowledge about living
things," have been the most usual aims. And the method has been that of minute examination
of a specimen from the plant or animal world, utterly detached from its surroundings, considered
by the docile child in parts, such as leaves, stem, roots, petals, and uses; or head, wings,
legs, tail, and habits. The innocent listener might frequently think with reason that a number
lesson rather than a nature lesson was being given. The day of the object lesson is past, and
to young children the nature lesson must become nature work.

It is in the term "nature lesson" that the root of the mischief lies: nature is not a lesson
to the young child, it is an interest from which he seeks to gain more pleasure, by means of
his own activity: plants encourage him to garden, animals stir his desire to watch, feed and
protect; water, earth and fire arouse his craving to investigate and experiment: there is no
motive for passive study at this juncture, and without a motive or purpose all study leads
to nothing. Adults compare, and count the various parts of a living thing for purposes of classification
connected with the subdivisions of life which we call botany and zoology; but such things are
far removed from the young child's world--only gradually does it begin to dawn on him that
there are interesting likenesses, and that in this world, as in his own, there are relationships;
when he realises this, the time for a nature lesson has come. But much direct experience must
come first.

In setting out the furnishing of the school the need for this activity is implied. No school
worthy of the name can do without a garden, any more than it can do without reading books,
or blackboards, indeed the former need is greater: if it is possible, and possibilities gradually
merge into acceptances, a pond should be in the middle of the garden, and trees should also
be considered as part of the whole. It is not difficult for the ordinary person to make a pond,
or even to begin a garden.

In a school situated in S.E. London in the midst of rows of monotonous little houses, and close
to a busy railway junction, a miracle was performed: the playground was not very large, and
of the usual uncompromising concrete. The children, most of whose fathers worked on the railway,
lived in the surrounding streets, and most of them had a back-yard of sorts; they had little
or no idea of a garden. One of the teachers had, however, a vision which became a reality.
She asked her children to help to make a garden, and for weeks every child brought from his
back-yard his little paper bag of soil which was deposited over some clinkers that were spread
out in a narrow border against the outside wall; in a few months there was a border of two
yards in which flowers were planted: the caretaker, inspired by the sight, did his share of
fixing a wooden strip as a kind of supporting border to the whole: in two years the garden
had spread all round the outside wall of the playground, and belonged to several classes.

An even greater miracle was performed in a dock-side school, where to most of the children
a back-yard was a luxury beyond all possibility. The school playground was very small, and
evening classes made a school garden quite impossible. But the head mistress was one who saw
life full of possibilities, and so she saw a garden even in the sordidness. Round the parish
church was a graveyard long disused, and near one of the gates a small piece of ground that
had never been used for any graveyard purpose: it was near enough to the school to be possible,
and in a short time the miracle happened--the entrance to the graveyard became a children's
flowering garden.

Inside the school where plants and flowers in pots are numerous, a part of the morning should
be spent in the care of these: few people know how to arrange flowers, and fewer how to feed
and wash them; if there are an aquarium or chrysalis boxes, they have to be attended to: all
this should be a regular duty with a strong sense of responsibility attached to it; it is curious
how many people are content to live in an atmosphere of decaying matter.

If the children enjoy so intensely the colour of the leaves and flowers they will be glad to
have the opportunity of painting them; this is as much a part of nature work as any other,
and it should be used as such, because it emphasises so strongly the side of appreciation of
beauty, a side very often neglected. It is here that the individual paint box is so important.
If children are to have any sense of colour they must learn to match very truthfully; there
is a great difference between the blue of the forget-me-not and of the bluebell, but only by
experiment can children discover that the difference lies in the amount of red in the latter.
By means of discoveries of this kind they will see new colours in life around them, and a new
depth of meaning will come to their everyday observations. This is true observation, not the
"look and say" of the oral lesson, which has no purpose in it, and leads to no natural activity,
or to appreciation.

It is difficult to satisfy the interest in animals. In connection with the Nursery School the
most suitable have been mentioned. The transition and junior school children may see others
when they go for excursions. At this stage, too, children have a great desire to learn about
wild animals, and the need often arises out of their literature: the camel that brought Rebecca
to Isaac, the wolf that adopted Mowgli, the reindeer that carried Kay and Gerda, the fox that
tried to eat the seven little kids, Androcles' lion, and Black Sambo's tiger, might form an
interesting series, helped by pictures of the creature in its own home. It is difficult to
say whether this may be termed literature, geography, or nature study. The difficulty serves
to show the unity of life at this period. Books such as Seton Thompson's, Long's, and Kearton's,
and many others, supply living experiences of animal life impossible to get from less direct
sources.

As children get older, and have the power to look back, they will feel the necessity of keeping
records; and thus the Nature Calendar, forerunner of geography, will be adopted naturally.

Another important feature in nature experiences is the excursion. Froebel says: "Not only children
and boys, but indeed many adults, fare with nature and her character as ordinary men fare with
the air. They are like people who have grown up in a very beautiful country and who have no
idea of its beauty and its spirit ... therefore it is so important that boys and adults should
go into the fields and forests, together striving to receive into their hearts and minds the
life and spirit of nature." It is evident from this that excursions are as necessary in the
country as in the town, where instead of the "fields and forests" perhaps only a park is possible,
but there is no virtue in an excursion taken without preparation. The teacher must first of
all visit the place and see what it is likely to give the children. She must tell them something
of it, give them some aim in going there, such as collecting leaves or fruits, or recording
different shapes of bare trees, or collecting things that grow in the grass. These are examples
of what a town park might yield. Within one group of children there might be many with different
aims. During the days following the excursion time should be spent in using these experiences,
either by means of painting and modelling, or making classified collections of things found,
or compiling records, oral or written. Otherwise the excursion degenerates into a school treat
without its natural enjoyment.

With regard to the inevitable gaps in the children's minds in connection with the world of
living things, such pictures as the following should be in every town school: a pine wood,
a rabbit warren, a natural pond, a ditch and hedge, a hayfield in June, a wild daffodil patch,
a sheet of bluebells, a cornfield at different stages, an orchard in spring and in autumn,
and many others. These must be constantly used when they are needed, and not misused in the
artificial method known as "picture talks."

There is another side to nature work. Not in dreams is it seen; it is permanent, it surrounds
us on all sides."

Froebel believed that contact with nature helps a child's realisation of God, and any one who
believes in early religious experience must agree; a child's early questions and difficulties,
as well as his early awe and fear show it--he is probably nearer to God in his nature work
than in many of the daily Scripture lessons. All his education should be permeated by spiritual
feeling, but there are some aspects in which the realisation is clearer, and possibly his contact
with nature stands out as the highest in this respect. There is no conscious method or art
in bringing this about; the teacher must feel it and be convinced of it.

Thus we come to the conclusion that the Nursery School nature work can be safely left to look
after itself, provided the surroundings are satisfying and the children are free.

In the transition and the junior school there should be no nature lessons of the object lesson
type, but plenty of nature work, leading to talks, handwork, and poetry. The aim is not economic
or informational at this stage, but the development of pure appreciation and interest. There
can hardly be a regular place on the time-table for such irregular work, comprising excursions,
gardening, handwork, and literature at least, and depending on the weather and the seasons.
There should always be a regular morning time for attending to plants and animals and for the
Nature Calendar, but no "living" teacher will be a slave to mere time-table thraldom.

CHAPTER  XXIII

EXPERIENCES OF MATHEMATICAL TRUTHS

By means of toys, handwork and games, as well as various private individual experiments, a
child touches on most sides of mathematics in the nursery class. In experimenting with bricks
he must of necessity have considered relative size, balance and adjustment, form and symmetry;
in fitting them back into their boxes some of the most difficult problems of cubic content;
in weighing out "pretence" sugar and butter by means of sand and clay new problems are there
for consideration; in making a paper-house questions of measurement evolve. This is all in
the incidental play of the Nursery School, and yet we might say that a child thus occupied
is learning mathematics more than anything else. Here, if he remained till six, he did a certain
amount of necessary counting, and he may have acquired skill in recognising groups, he may
have unconsciously and incidentally performed achievements in the four rules, but never, of
course, in any shortened or technical form. Probably he knows some figures. It is best to give
these to a child when he asks for or needs them, as in the case of records of games. On the
other hand he may be content with strokes. Various mathematical relationships are made clear
in his games or trials of strength, such as distance in relation to time or strength, weight
in relation to power and to balance, length and breadth in relation to materials, value of
material in relation to money or work. By means of many of his toys the properties of solids
have become working knowledge to him. Here, then, is our starting-point for the transition period.

AFTER THE NURSERY STAGE

Undoubtedly the aim of the transition class is partly to continue by means of games and dramatic
play the kind of knowledge gained in the Nursery School; but it has also the task of beginning
to organise such knowledge, as the grouping into tens and hundreds. This organisation of raw
material and the presenting of shortened processes, as occur in the first four rules, forms
the work also of the junior school. To give to a child shortened processes which he would be
very unlikely to discover in less than a lifetime, is simply giving him the experience of the
race, as primitive man did to his son. But the important point is to decide when a child's
discovery should end and the teacher's demonstration begin.

This is the period when we are accustomed to speak of beginning "abstract" work; it is well
to be clear what it means, and how it stands related to a child's need for experience. When
we leave the problems of life, such as shopping, keeping records of games and making measurements
for construction; and when we begin to work with pure number, we are said to be dealing with
the abstract. Formerly dealing with pure number was called "simple," and dealing with actual
things, such as money and measures, "compound," and they were taken in this order. But experience
has reversed the process, and a child comes to see the need of abstract practice when he finds
he is not quick enough or accurate enough, or his setting out seems clumsy, in actual problems.
This was discussed at greater length in the chapter on Play.

For instance, he might set down the points of a game by strokes, each line representing a different
opponent:

John   ||||||||||||||||

Henry  |||||||||||

Tom    |||

He will see how difficult it is to estimate at a glance the exact score, and how easy it is
to be inaccurate. It seems the moment to show him that the idea of grouping or enclosing a
certain number, and always keeping to the same grouping, is helpful:

John       ||||||||||   ||||||  =   1 ten and 6 singles.

Henry      ||||||||||   |       =   1 ten and 1 single.

Tom                     |||     =   3 singles.

After doing this a good many times he could be told that this is a universal method, and he
would doubtless enjoy the purely puzzle pleasure in working long sums to perfect practice.
This pleasure is very common in children at this stage, but too often it comes to them merely
through being shown the "trick" of carrying tens. They have reached a purely abstract point,
but they cannot get through it without some more material help. The following is an example
of the kind of help that can be given in getting clear the concept of the ten grouping and
the processes it involves:

The whole apparatus is a rectangular piece of wood about 3/4 of an inch thick, and about 3x1-1/2
feet of surface. It is painted white, and the horizontal bars are green, so that the divisions
may be apparent at a distance; it has perpendicular divisions breaking it up into three columns,
each of which contains rows of nine small dresser hooks. It can be hung on an easel or supported
by its own hinge on a table. Each of the divisions represents a numerical grouping, the one
on the right is for singles or units, the central one for tens, and the left side one for hundreds:
the counters used are button moulds, dipped in red ink, with small loops of string to hang
on the hooks: it is easily seen by a child that, after nine is reached, the units can no longer
remain in their division or "house," but must be gathered together into a bunch (fastened by
a safety pin) and fixed on one of the hooks of the middle division.

Sums of two or three lines can thus be set out on the horizontal bars, and in processes of
addition the answer can be on the bottom line. It is very easy, by this concrete means, to
see the process in subtraction, and indeed the whole difficulty of dealing with ten is made
concrete. The whole of a sum can be gone through on this board with the button-moulds, and
on boards and chalk with figures, side by side, thus interpreting symbol by material; but the
whole process is abstract.

The piece of apparatus is less abstract only in degree than the figures on the blackboard,
because neither represents real life or its problems: in abstract working we are merely going
off at a side issue for the sake of practice, to make us more competent to deal with the economic
affairs of life. There is a place for sticks and counters, and there is a place for money and
measures, but they are not the same: the former represents the abstract and the latter the
concrete problem if used as in real life: the bridge between the abstract and the concrete
is largely the work of the transition class and junior school, in respect of the foundations
of arithmetic known as the first four rules.

Games of skill, very thorough shopping or keeping a bankbook, or selling tickets for tram or
train, represent the kind of everyday problem that should be the centre of the arithmetic work
at this transition stage; and out of the necessities of these problems the abstract and semi-abstract
work should come, but it should never precede the real work. A real purpose should underlie
it all, a purpose that is apparent and stimulating enough to produce willing practice. A child
will do much to be a good shopkeeper, a good tram conductor, a good banker; he will always
play the game for all it is worth.

CHAPTER XXIV

EXPERIENCES BY MEANS OF DOING

In the Nursery School activity is the chief characteristic: one of its most usual forms is
experimenting with tools and materials, such as chalk, paints, scissors, paper, sand, clay
and other things. The desire to experiment, to change the material in some way, to gratify
the senses, especially the muscular one, may be stronger than the desire to construct. The
handwork play of the Nursery School is therefore chiefly by means of imitation and experiment,
and direct help is usually quite unwelcome to the child under six. There is little more to
be said in the way of direction than, "Provide suitable material, give freedom, and help, if
the child wants it." But the case is rather different in the transitional stage. As the race
learnt to think by doing, so children seem to approach thought in that way; they have a natural
inclination to do in the first case; they try, do wrongly, consider, examine, observe, and
do again: for example, a girl wants to make a doll's bonnet like the baby's; she begins impulsively
to cut out the stuff, finds it too small, tries to visualise the right size, examines the real
bonnet, and makes another attempt. At some apparently odd moment she stumbles on a truth, perhaps
the relation of one form to another in the mazes of bonnet-making; it is at these odd moments
that we learn. Or a boy may be painting a Christmas card, and in another odd moment he may
feel something of the beauty of colour, if, for example, he is copying holly-berries. No purposeless
looking at them would have stirred appreciation. Whether the end is doing, or whether it is
thinking, the two are inextricably connected; in the earlier stages the way to know and feel
is very often by action, and here is the basis of the maxim that handwork is a method.

This idea has often been only half digested, and consequently it has led to a very trivial
kind of application; a nature lesson of the "look and say" description has been followed by
a painting lesson; a geography lesson, by the making of a model. If the method of learning
by doing was the accepted aim of the teacher then it was not carried out, for this is learning
and then doing, not learning for the purpose of doing, but doing for the purpose of testing
the learning, which is quite another matter, and not a very natural procedure with young children.
Many people have tried to make things from printed directions, a woman may try to make a blouse
and a man to make a knife-box; their procedure is not to separate the doing and the learning
process; probably they have first tried to do, found need for help, and gone to the printed
directions, which they followed side by side with the doing; and in the light of former failures
or in the course of looking or of experimenting, they stumbled upon knowledge: this is learning
by doing.

Therefore the making of a box may be arithmetic, the painting of a buttercup may be nature
study, the construction of a model, or of dramatic properties may be geography or history,
not by any means the only way of learning, but one of the earlier ways and a very sound way;
there is a purpose to serve behind it all, that will lead to very careful discrimination in
selection of knowledge, and to pains taken to retain it. If this is fully understood by a teacher
and she is content to take nature's way, and abide for nature's time to see results, then her
methods will be appropriately applied: she will see that she is not training a race of box-makers,
but that she is guiding children to discover things that they need to know in a natural way,
and ensuring that as these facts are discovered they shall be used. Consequently neither haste
nor perfection of finish must cloud the aim; it is not the output that matters but the method
by which the children arrive at the finished object, not forty good boxes, but forty good thinkers.
Dewey has put it most clearly when he says that the right test of an occupation consists "in
putting the maximum of consciousness into whatever is done." Froebel says, "What man tries
to represent or do he begins to understand."

This is what we should mean by saying that handwork is a method of learning.

But handwork has its own absolute place as well. A child wants to acquire skill in this direction
even more consciously than he wants to learn: if he has been free, in the nursery class, to
experiment with materials, and if he knows some of his limitations, he is now, in the transition
class, ready for help, and he should get it as he needs it. This may run side by side with
the more didactic side of handwork which has been described, but it is more likely that in
practice the two are inextricably mixed up; and this does not matter if the two ends are clear
in the teacher's mind; both sides have to be reckoned with.

The important thing to know is the kind of help that should be given, and when and how it is
needed. It is well to remember that in this connection a child's limitations are not final,
but only mark stages: for example, in his early attempts to use thick cardboard he cannot discover
the neat hinge that is made by the process known as a "half-cut"; he tries in vain to bend
the cardboard, so as to secure the same result. There are two ways of helping him: either he
can be quite definitely shown and made to imitate, or he can be set to think about it; he is
given a cardboard knife and allowed to experiment: if he fails, it may be suggested that a
clean edge can only be got by some form of cutting; probably he will find out the rest of the
process. The second method is the better one, because it promotes thinking, while the first
only promotes pure imitation and the habit of reckoning on this easy solution of difficulties.
A dull child may have to be shown, but there are few such children, unless they have been trained
to dulness.

Imitation is not, however, always a medicine for dulness, nor does it always produce dulness.
There is a time for imitation and there is a kind of imitation that is very intelligent. For
example, a child may come across a toy aeroplane and wish to make one; he will examine it carefully,
think over the uses of parts and proceed to make one as like it as possible: here again is
the maximum of consciousness, the essence of thinking. Or the imitation may consist in following
verbal directions: this is far from easy if the teacher is at all vague, and promotes valuable
effort if she is clear but not diffuse: the putting of words into action necessitates a considerable
amount of imagining, and the establishment of very important associations in brain centres.
Such cases might occur in connection with weaving, cardboard and paper work, or the more technical
processes of drawing and painting, where race experience is actually given to a child, by means
of which he leaps over the experiences of centuries. This is progress.

If a teacher is to take handwork seriously, and not as a pretty recreation with pleasing results,
she should be fully conscious of all that it means, and apply this definitely in her work:
it is so easy to be trivial while appearing to be thorough by having well-finished work produced,
which has necessitated little hard thinking on the child's part. Construction gives a sense
of power, a strengthening of the will, ability to concentrate on a purpose in learning, a social
sense of serviceableness, a deepened individuality: but this can only be looked for if a child
is allowed to approach it in the right way, first as an experimenter and investigator, or as
an artist, and afterwards as a learner, who is also an individual, and learns in his own way
and at his own rate: but if the teacher's ambition is external and economic then the child
is a tool in her hands, and will remain a tool. We cannot expect the fruits of the spirit if
our goal is a material one.

One of the lessons of the war is economy. In handwork this has come to us through the quest
for materials, but it has been a blessing, if now and then in disguise. In the more formal
period of handwork only prepared, almost patented material was used; everything was "requisitioned"
and eager manufacturers supplied very highly finished stuff. Not very many years ago, the keeper
of a "Kindergarten" stall at an exhibition said, while pointing to cards cut and printed with
outlines for sewing and pricking, "We have so many orders for these that we can afford to lay
down considerable plant for their production." An example in another direction is that of a
little girl who attended one of the best so-called Kindergartens of the time: she was afflicted,
while at home, with the "don't know what to do" malady; her mother suggested that she might
make some of the things she made at school, but she negatived that at once with the remark,
"I couldn't do that, you see, because we have none of the right kind of stuff to make them
of here."

It is quite unnecessary to give more direct details as to the kind of work suitable and the
method of doing it; more than enough books of help have been published on every kind of material,
and it might perhaps be well if we made less use of such terms as "clay-modelling," "cardboard-work,"
"raffia," and took handwork more in the sense of constructive or expressive work, letting the
children select one or several media for their purpose; they ought to have access to a variety
of material; and except when they waste, they should use it freely. It is limiting and unenlightened
to put down a special time for the use of special material, if the end might be better answered
by something else: if modelling is at 11.30 on Monday and children are anxious to make Christmas
presents, what law in heaven or earth are we obeying if we stick to modelling except the law
of Red Tape.

CHAPTER XXV

EXPERIENCES OF THE LIFE OF MAN

This aspect of experience comes in two forms, the life of man in the past, with the memorials
and legacies he has left, and the life of man in the present under the varying conditions of
climate and all that it involves. In other words these experiences are commonly known as history
and geography, though in the earlier stages of their appearance in school it is perhaps better
to call the work--preparation for history and geography. They would naturally appear in the
transition or the junior class, preferably in the latter, but they need not be wholly new subjects
to a child; his literature has prepared him for both; to some extent his experiments in handwork
have prepared him for history, while his nature work, especially his excursions and records,
have prepared him for geography. That he needs this extension of experience can be seen in
his growing demands for true stories, true in the more literal sense which he is coming fast
to appreciate; undoubtedly most children pass through a stage of extreme literalism between
early childhood and what is generally recognised as boyhood and girlhood. They begin to ask
questions regarding the past, they are interested in things from "abroad," however vague that
term may be to them.

Perhaps it will be best to treat the two subjects separately, though like all the child's curriculum
at this stage they are inextricably confused and mingled both with each other, and with literature,
as experiences of man's life and conduct.

The beginnings of geography lie in the child's foundations of experience. Probably the first
real contact, unconscious though it may be, that any child has in this connection is through
the production of food and clothing. A country child sees some of the beginnings of both, but
it is doubtful how much of it is really interpreted by him; the village shop with its inexhaustible
stores probably means much more in the way of origins, and he may never go behind its contents
in his speculations. It is true he sees milking, harvesting, sheep-shearing, and many other
operations, but he often misses the stage between the actual beginning and the finished product--between
the wool on the sheep's back and his Sunday clothes, between the wheat in the field and his
loaf of bread. The town child has many links if he can use them: the goods train, the docks,
the grocer's, green-grocer's or draper's shop, foreigners in the street, the vans that come
through the silent streets in the early morning; in big towns, such markets as Covent Garden
or Leadenhall or Smithfield; such a river as the Thames, Humber or Mersey--from any one of
these beginnings he can reach out from his own small environment to the world. A town child
has very confused notions of what a farm really means to national life, and a country child
of what a big railway station or dock involves. All children need to know what other parts
of their own land look like, and what is produced; they ought to trace the products within
reach to their origin, and this will involve descriptions of such things as fisheries at Hull
or Aberdeen, the coal mines of Wales or Lanarkshire, pottery districts of Stafford, woollen
and cotton factories of Yorkshire and Lancashire, mills driven by steam, wind and water, lighthouses,
the sheep-rearing districts of Cumberland and Midlothian, the flax-growing of northern Ireland,
and much else, and the means of transit and communication between all these. The children will
gradually realise that many of the things they are familiar with, such as tea, oranges, silk
and sugar, have not been accounted for, and this will take them to the lives of people in other
countries, the means of getting there, the time taken and mode of travelling. They will also
come to see that we do not produce enough of the things that are possible to grow, such as
wheat, apples, wool and many other common necessaries, and that we can spare much that is manufactured
to countries that do not make them, such as boots, clothes, china and cutlery. There will come
a time when the need for a map is apparent: that is the time to branch off from the main theme
and make one; it will have to be of the very immediate surroundings first, but it is not difficult
to make the leap soon to countries beyond. Previous to the need for it, map-making is useless.

This working outwards from actual experiences, from the home country to the foreign, from actual
contact with real things to things of travellers' tales, is the only way to bring geography
to the very door of the school, to make it part of the actual life.

The beginning of history, as of geography, lies in the child's foundations of experience. In
the country village he sees the church, possibly some old cottages, or an Elizabethan or Jacobean
house near; in the churchyard or in the church the tombstones have quaint inscriptions with
reference possibly to past wars or to early colonisation. The slum child on the other hand
sees much that is worn out, but little that is antiquated, unless the slum happen to be in
such places as Edinburgh or Deptford, situated among the remains of really fine houses: but
he realises more of the technicalities and officialism of a social system than does the country
child; the suburban child has probably the scantiest store of all; his district is presumably
made up of rows of respectable but monotonous houses, and the social life is similarly respectable
and monotonous.

There are certain cravings, interests and needs, common to all children, which come regardless
of surroundings. All children want to know certain things about people who lived before them,
not so much their great doings as their smaller ones; they want to know what these people were
like, what they worked at, and learnt, how they travelled, what they bought and sold: and there
is undoubtedly a primitive strain in all children that comes out in their love of building
shelters, playing at savages, and making things out of natural material. One of the most intense
moments in Peter Pan to many children is the building of the little house in the wood, and
later on, of the other on the top of the trees: that is the little house of their dreams. They
are not interested in constitutions or the making of laws; wars and invasions have much the
same kind of interest for them as the adventures of Una and the Red Cross Knight.

How are these cravings usually satisfied in the early stages of history teaching of to-day?
As a rule a series of biographies of notable people is given, regardless of chronology, or
the children's previous experiences, and equally careless of the history lessons of the future;
Joan of Arc, Alfred and the Cakes, Gordon of Khartoum, Boadicea, Christopher Columbus, Julius
Caesar, form a list which is not at all uncommon; there is no leading thread, no developing
idea, and the old test, "the children like it," excuses indolent thinking. On the other hand,
the desire to know more of the Robinson Crusoe mode of life has been apparent to many teachers
for some time, but the material at their disposal has been scanty and uncertain. It is to Prof.
Dewey that we owe the right organisation of this part of history. He has shown that it is on
the side of industry, the early modes of weaving, cooking, lighting and heating, making implements
for war and for hunting, and making of shelters, that prehistoric man has a real contribution
to give: but for the beginnings of social life, for realisation of such imperishable virtues
as courage, patriotism and self-sacrifice, children must go to the lives of real people and
gradually acquire the idea that certain things are, so to speak, from "everlasting to everlasting,"
while others change with changing and growing circumstances.

The prehistoric history should be largely concerned with doing and experimenting, with making
weapons, or firing clay, or weaving rushes, or with visits to such museums as Horniman's at
Forest Hill. The early social history may well take the form best suited to the child, and
not appeal merely to surface interest. And the spirit in which the lives of other people are
presented to children must not be the narrow, prejudiced, insular one, so long associated with
the people of Great Britain, which calls other customs, dress, modes of: living, "funny" or
"absurd" or "extraordinary," but rather the scientific spirit that interprets life according
to its conditions and so builds up one of its greatest laws, the law of environment.

The geography syllabus, even more than the history one, depends for its beginnings at least
on the surroundings of the school--out of the mass of possible materials a very rich and comprehensive
syllabus can be made, beginning with any one of the central points already suggested. Above
all there should be plenty of pictures, not as amplification, but as material, by means of
which a child may interpret more fully; a picture should be of the nature of a problem or of
a map--and picture reading should be in the junior school what map reading is in the upper school.

In both history and geography the method is partly that of discovery; especially is this the
case in that part of history which deals with primitive industries, and in almost the whole
of the geography of this period. The teacher is the guide or leader in discovery, not the story-teller
merely, though this may be part of his function.

The following is a small part of a syllabus to show how geography and history material may
grow naturally out of the children's experiences. It is meant in this case for children in
a London suburb, with no particular characteristics:--

GEOGRAPHY

It grows out of the shops of the neighbourhood and the adjoining railway system.

  Home-produced Goods--

  A.  The green-grocer's shop.
      Tracing of fruit to its own home source, or to a foreign country.
      Home-grown fruit. The fruit farm, garden, orchard, and wood.
      The packing and sending of fruit.--Railway lines.
      Covent Garden; the docks; fruit stalls; jam factories.

  B.  A grocer's or corn-chandler's shop.
      Flour and oatmeal traced to their sources.
      The farm. A wheat and grain farm at different seasons. A dairy farm
          and a sheep farm.
      A mill and its processes.
      Woollen factories.
      A dairy. Making of butter and cheese
      Distribution of these goods.

  C.  A china shop, leading to the pottery district and making of pottery.

  Foreign Goods--

  Furs--Red Indians and Canada.
  Dates--The Arabs and the Sahara.
  Cotton--The Negroes and equatorial regions.
  Cocoa--The West Indies.
  The transit of these, their arrival and distribution.

[The need for a map will come early in the first part of the course, and the need for a globe
in the second.]

HISTORY

This grows naturally out of the geography syllabus and might be taken side by side or afterwards.

  The development of industries.
  The growth of spinning and weaving from the simplest processes, bringing
      in the distaff, spinning-wheel, and loom.
  The making of garments from the joining together of furs.
  The growth of pottery and the development of cooking.
  The growth of roads and means of transit.

[This will involve a good deal of experimental and constructive handwork.]

CHAPTER XXVI

EXPERIENCES RECORDED AND PASSED ON

Reading and writing are held to have lifted man above the brute; they are the means by which
we can discover and record human experience and progress, and as such their value is incalculable.
But in themselves they are artificial conventions, symbols invented for the convenience of
mankind, and to acquire them we need exercise no great mental power. A good eye and ear memory,
and a certain superficial quickness to recognise and apply previous knowledge, is all that
is needed for reading and spelling; while for writing, the development of a specialised muscular
skill is all that is necessary. In themselves they do not as a rule hold any great interest
for a child: sometimes they have the same puzzle interest as a long addition sum, and to children
of a certain type, mechanical work such as writing gives relief; one of the most docile and
uninteresting of little boys said that writing was his favourite subject, and it was easy to
understand: he did not want to be stirred out of his commonplaceness; unconsciously he had
assimilated the atmosphere and adopted the standards of his surroundings, which were monotonous
and commonplace in the extreme, and so he desired no more adventurous method of expression
than the process of writing, which he could do well. Imitation is often a strong incentive
to reading, it is part of the craving for grown-upness to many children; they desire to do
what their brothers and sisters can do. But during the first stage of childhood, roughly up
to the age of six or even later, no child needs to learn to read or write, taking "need" in
the psychological sense: that period is concerned with laying the foundation of real things
and with learning surroundings;--any records of experience that come to a child can come as
they did to his earliest forefathers--by word of mouth. When he wants to read stories for himself,
or write his own letters, then he is impelled by a sufficiently strong aim or incentive to
make concentration possible, without resorting to any of the fantastic devices and apparatus
so dear to so many teachers. Indeed it is safe to say of many of these devices that they prove
the fact that children are not ready for reading.

When a child is ready to read and write the process need not be a long one: by wise delay many
tedious hours are saved, tedious to both teacher and children; they have already learnt to
talk in those precious hours, to discriminate sounds as part of language training, but without
any resort to symbols--merely as something natural. It has been amply proved that if a child
is not prematurely forced into reading he can do as much in one year as he would have done
in three, under more strained conditions.

With regard to methods a great deal has been written on the subject; it is pretty safe to leave
a teacher to choose her own--for much of the elaboration is unnecessary if reading is rightly
delayed, and if a child can read reasonably well at seven and a half there can be no grounds
for complaint. If his phonetic training has been good in the earlier stages of language, then
this may be combined with the "look and say" method, or method of reading by whole words. The
"cat on the mat" type of book is disappearing, and its place is being taken by books where
the subject matter is interesting and suitable to the child's age; but as in other subjects
the book chosen should be considered in reference to the child's surroundings, either to amplify
or to extend.

Writing is, in the first instance, a part of reading: when words are being learnt they must
be written, or in the earliest stages printed, but only those interesting to the children and
written for some definite purpose should be selected: a great aid to spelling is transcription,
and children are always willing to copy something they like, such as a verse of poetry, or
their name and address. As in arithmetic and in handwork, they will come to recognise the need
for practice, and be willing to undergo such exercise for the sake of improvement, as well
as for the pleasure in the activity--which actual writing gives to some children.

We must be quite clear about relative values. Reading and writing are necessities, and the
means of opening up to us things of great value; but the art of acquiring them is of little
intrinsic value, and the recognition of the need is not an early one; nothing is gained by
beginning too early, and much valuable time is taken from other activities, notably language.
The incentive should be the need that the child feels, and when this is evident time and pains
should be given to the subject so that it maybe quickly acquired. But the art of reading is
no test of intelligence, and the art of writing is no test of original skill. The claims of
the upper departments must be resisted.

CHAPTER XXVII

THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER

The first thing that matters is what is commonly called the personality of the teacher; she
must be a person, unmistakable from other persons, and not a type; what she has as an individual,
of gifts or goodness, she should give freely, and give in her own way; that she should be trained
is, of course, as indisputable as the training of a doctor, but her training should have deepened
her personality. Pestalozzi's curriculum and organisation left much to be desired; what he
has handed down to us came from himself and his own experience, not from anything superimposed:
records of his pupils constantly emphasise this: it was his goodness assimilated with his outlook
on life and readiness to learn by experience, that mattered, and it was this that remained
with his pupils. The teacher's own personality must dominate her choice of principles else
she is a dead method, a machine, and not a living teacher. She must not keep her interests
and gifts for out-of-school use; if she has a sense of humour she must use it, if she is fond
of pretty clothes she must wear them in school, if she appreciates music she must help her
class to do the same, if she has dramatic gifts she must act to them. Her standard of goodness
must be high, and she must be strong enough to adopt it practically, so that she is unconscious
of it: goodness and righteousness are as essential as health to a teacher: for something intangible
passes from the teacher to her children, however young and unconscious they may be, and nothing
can awaken goodness but goodness.

Part of her personality is her attitude towards religion. It is difficult to think of a teacher
of young children who is not religious, i.e. whose conduct is not definitely permeated by her
spiritual life: young children are essentially religious, and the life of the spirit must find
a response in the same kind of intangible assumption of its existence as goodness. No form
of creed or dogma is meant, only the life of the spirit common to all. But of course there
may be people who refuse to admit this as a necessity.

The next thing that matters is that all children must be regarded as individuals: there has
been much more talk of this lately, but practical difficulties are often raised as a bar. If
teachers and parents continue to accept the conditions which make it difficult, such as large
classes, and a need to hasten, there will always be a bar: if individuality is held as one
of the greatest things in education, authorities cannot continue to economise so as to make
it impossible. It is the individual part of each child that is his most precious possession,
his immortal side: Froebel calls it his "divine essence," and makes the cultivation of it the
aim of education; he is right, and any more general aim will lead only to half-developed human
beings. If we accept the principle that only goodness is fundamental and evil a distortion
of nature, we need have no fear about cultivating individuals. Every doctor assures us that
all normal babies are naturally healthy; they are also naturally good, but evil is easily aroused
by arbitrary interference or by mismanagement.

The third thing that matters belongs more especially to the intellectual life; it might be
described as the making of right associations. More than any other side of training, the making
of associations means the making of the intelligent person. To see life in patches is to see
pieces of a great picture by the square inch, and never to see the relationship of these to
each other--never to see the whole.

The fourth thing that matters is the making of good and serviceable habits: much has been said
on this, in connection with the nursery class, and it is at that stage that the process is
most important, but it should never cease. If a child is to have time and opportunity to develop
his individuality he must not be hampered by having to be conscious of things that belong to
the subconscious region. To start a child with a foundation of good habits is better than riches.

The fifth thing that matters is the realisation by teachers that opportunities matter more
than results; opportunities to discover, to learn, to comprehend all sides of life, to be an
individual, to appreciate beauty, to go at one's own rate; some are material in their nature,
such as the actual surroundings of the child in school; others are rather in the atmosphere,
such as refraining from interference, encouragement, suggestion, spirituality. The teacher
has the making of opportunities largely in her own hands.

The sixth thing, that matters is the cultivation of the divine gift of imagination; both morality
and spirituality spring from this; meanness, cowardice, lack of sympathy, sensuality, materialism,
quickly grow where there is no imagination. It refines and intensifies personality, it opens
a door to things beyond the senses. It makes possible appreciation of the things of the spirit,
and appreciation is a thousand times more important than knowledge.

The last thing that matters is the need for freedom from bondage, of the body and of the soul.
Only from a free atmosphere can come the best things--personality, imagination and opportunity;
and all are great needs, but the greatest of all is freedom.
