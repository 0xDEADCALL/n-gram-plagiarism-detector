DEDICATION.

TO HIS  ROYAL HIGHNESS  THE DUKE OF YORK.

SIR,
      WITH the design of serving an amiable and worthy man, I have
availed myself of your Royal Highness's permission to dedicate to you
the translation of a work, which, as a faithful narrative of events,
wants no additional comment to make it interesting.  A detail of
facts, in which your Royal Highness, in behalf of your country, has
been so honourably engaged, may not prove unwelcome in aid of
recollection; and a detail of facts, built on the experimental
horrors of popular power, and  which, proceeding from the wildness of
theory to the madness of practice, has swept away every vestige of
civil polity, and would soon leave neither law nor religion in the
world, cannot, either in point of instruction or warning, be
unreasonably laid  before my fellow-citizens at large.

Under the sanction, therefore, Sir, of your illustrious name, I willingly commit to them this
memorial.  And if an innocent victim of oppression  should thus derive a small, though painful,
subsistence  from a plain and publick (sic) recital of his country's crimes, I shall be abundantly
repaid for the little share I may have had in bringing it into notice; and by the  opportunity
it affords me of subscribing myself

Your ever grateful and devoted humble servant,

FRANCIS RANDOLPH.

BATH,  July 22, 1796

PREFACE

THE following sheets contain a journal of principal  events of the French Revolution.  The
best authorities  have been resorted to, and the facts are related without any comment.  The
reader will find a faithful outline of an interesting and momentous period of history, and
will see how naturally each error produced its corresponding misfortune.

Various causes contributed to effect a revolution in the  minds of Frenchmen, and led the way
to a revolution in the state.  The arbitrary nature of the government had been long submitted
to, and perhaps would have continued so much longer, if France had not taken part in the American
war.

The perfidious policy of VERGENNES, who, with a view of humbling the pride of England, assisted
the subject in arms against his Sovereign, soon imported into his own nation the seeds of liberty,
which it had helped to cultivate in a country  of rebellion; and the crown of France, as I
once heard it emphatically observed, was lost in the plains of America.  The soldier returned
to Europe with new doctrines instead  of new discipline, and the army in general soon grew
dissatisfied with the Monarch, on account of unusual, and,  as they thought, ignominious rigours
which were introduced into it from the military school of Germany.  The King also, from a necessity
of retrenchment, had induced his ministers to adopt some mistaken measures of economy respecting
the  troops, and thus increased the odium which pride had fostered, and by diminishing the
splendour of the crown, stripped it of its security and protection.

To this was added the wanton profusion of the Court in other expenses, and the external parade
and brilliancy, which, if they impoverish, often dazzle and gratify the people, was exchanged
for familiar entertainments, which gave rise to frequent jealousies among the nobles, and tended
to lower that sense of awe and respect for royalty among the people, which in monarchies it
is of the utmost importance to preserve.

At this time, also, philosophical discussion had reached its pinnacle of boldness.  Infidelity
had woven the web of discord in the human mind, which was now ripe for experiment, and ROUSSEAU
and VOLTAIRE were the favourite authors.

Previous to the year 1789, from the extreme disorder of the finances, it became necessary to
raise money by  extraordinary taxes, which the common powers of the parliament were deemed
insufficient to authorize; and afraid, in the present temper of the people, to impose upon
them  unusual burthens, ministers looked with solicitude for some other sanctions.

Monsieur DE CALONNE was unwilling to adopt so dangerous an expedient as that of assembling
the states-general; [Footnote: An Assembly consisting of deputies from the three orders of
citizens in France, namely, the clergy, the nobility, and the tiers-etat; which last included
every French citizen who was not of the clergy or nobility.] he therefore adopted the expedient
of summoning an assembly of notables, or eminent persons, chosen by the King from the different
parts of the kingdom.

This assembly did not prove so favourable to the  measures of the minister as he expected:
Monsieur DE CALONNE was displaced, and the assembly was soon after dissolved, having declared
itself incompetent to decide on the taxes proposed.

The King then commanded the parliament of Paris to register his edicts for successive loans
to the government; but his commands were rejected.  [Footnote: Chiefly, as it was supposed,
through the influence of the Duke of Orleans.]

In the meantime, that spirit of discussing philosophical subjects, which we have before mentioned,
now fixed itself on politics.  The people exclaimed against the weight of taxes, and the extravagance
of courtiers; they complained of peculiar exemptions from the general burthens, and of grievances
which arose from lettres-de -cachet, and other despotic powers of the government.

The King, desirous of yielding to the wishes of the people, recalled Monsieur NECKAR to the
administration, and in conformity to his advice, his Majesty declared his resolution of convening
the states-general.  But in order to regulate all matters relative to the meeting of this important
assembly, it was resolved to convoke the notables a second time.  Among these, a diversity
of opinion appeared respecting the comparative number of deputies to be sent by the Commons,
and the two other orders; the cardinal point on which the whole success of the revolution eventually
turned. [Footnote: The last assembly of the states-general, which had been held in France in
1614, was composed of 140 deputies from the order of the clergy, among whom were five cardinals,
seven archbishops, and 47 bishops; 132, representatives of the nobility; and 192 deputies from
the commons.  The Cardinal de JOYEUSE was president of the clergy; the Baron SENECEY of the
nobility; and the president of the commons was ROBERT MIRON, Prêvot-de-Marchands, (an officer
similar to that of mayor of Paris.)]  All the classes into which the notables were divided,
decided for an equality of deputies, except those in which MONSIEUR and the Duke of ORLEANS
presided.

In these, it was agreed that the representatives of the commons should be equal in number to
those of the other two states.  The ministry were of opinion that this double representation
was adviseable (sic), and persuaded themselves that, through their weight and influence they
should be able to prevent any mischief to be apprehended from this preponderance of the tiers-etat.
By their advice, the King issued an ordinance in January 1789, throughout the whole kingdom,
commanding the people to assemble in their bailiwicks, and to nominate deputies to represent
them in the states-general; viz. 300 for the clergy, 300 for the nobility, and 600 for the commons.

1787.
March.          THE Assembly of Notables first convened under the

1788.
August.         Mons.  Necker replaced at the head of the finances
                  on the dismission (sic) of Mons. de Calonne; and

                  prime minister.
Nov.            Mons. Necker persuades the King to call the
                  Notables together a second time.

                  assembly of the States-general.  The clergy to
                  depute 300 representatives, the nobility the like
                  number, and the commons 600.

June       17.  The chamber of the Tiers-Etat (commons) declares
                  itself a national assembly.
             19.  The Tiers-Etat takes the famous oath, known by the
                  "serment au Jeu de Paume," not to separate until
                  the constitution should be established.
             23.  The King goes in person to the assembly--but his
                  presence, far from intimidating the members,
                  renders them so intractable that from this epoch
                  may be dated the first attacks upon the royal
                  authority.
             24.  Forty-eight of the nobles, with the Duke of Orleans
                  at their head, unite with the tiers-etat (third
                  estate, or commons).
                  A considerable number of the clergy follow their
                  example.
             28.  The King, from a desire of peace, requests the
                  whole body of nobility and clergy to unite in one
                  assembly with the commons; which is acceded to.

                  the fury of the assailants.  Bertier, intendant of
                  Paris; Foulon, secretary of state; and de
                  Flesselle, prêvot des Marchands, (somewhat like
                  mayor of Paris) are massacred.  From, this period
                  the maxim was adopted, "that insurrection was the
                  most sacred of duties."
             15.  The King goes to the assembly to confer with it
                  upon the disturbances of Paris.  Many considerable

             16.  The Marquis de la Fayette, and Monsieur Bailly, are

             17.  In hopes of quieting the alarming tumults, the King
                  comes to Paris.  Bailly harangues him freely at the
                  Hotel de la Ville, (sic) and the King receives the
                  three-coloured cockade.

                  of the Palace, they forcibly conduct both him and

                  populace, and with great danger of their lives.
             10.  Tayllerang-Perigord, bishop of Autun, proposes that

                  The name of Jacobins was derived from the house
                  where the club met, and which had belonged to the
                  religious order of Jacobins.
Nov.       22.  The commune of Paris makes a patriotic gift of its

                  wounds, drying up tears, and repairing by the force

                  41,892 rejected it, (so the convention reports);
                  consequently it was decreed that the new
                  constitution is become a fundamental law of the
                  state.

                  The committee of marine writes thus to the
                  convention: "We are going to prepare arms in our
                  "arsenals and forges against the most perfidious of
                  "our enemies, against the haughty England, which

                  The convention addresses the Parisians, to inform

                  representatives, the convention will remove to
                  Chalons-sur-Maire (sic).  The convention, which
                  never had so much apprehension for its safety,
                  ordered the republican columns to march to its
                  defence.
                  Decreed, that every member of the convention shall
                  make a declaration of his fortune before, and since
                  the revolution.
                  Joubert, representative of the people, writes to
                  the convention, that the French, since their
                  passage of the Rhine, have taken 371 pieces of
                  cannon, 331,000 pounds of powder, and other stores.
                  Decreed, that Belgium and all the countries which
                  are, or shall be, conquered from the House of
                  Austria, shall be incorporated with the French
                  republic.
                  The section of Le Pelletier writes severe truths to
                  the convention.
                  The salaries settled by the constitution upon the
                  750 members of the next legislature, amount to 174
                  millions of livres a year.  The salary of the five
                  members of the executive directory amounts to
                  20,400,000 livres.

                  Brussels, Liege, Maestricht, Mons, Namur, and
                  Luxemburg.

                  An afflicting picture given of the state of the
                  Southern provinces of France, by a representative
                  of the people who was an eye witness of it.
                  The primary and permanent assemblies of Paris
                  demand of the convention the re-imprisonment of the
                  terrorists, and enquiry into the conduct of the
                  committees of government.
Oct.        5.  An extraordinary fermentation agitates all Paris.
                  A civil war is ready to break out.  The clashing of
                  arms, the general beating of drums, and the cannon,
                  are heard on all sides.  Several bloody engagements
                  take place between the sections and
                  conventionalists.  Two thousand dead bodies lie in
                  the streets.  The party of the convention, by the
                  aid of the troops of the line and of a formidable
                  artillery, defeats the insurgents.

                  who did not like a republican government.
                  The Count d'Artois, under convoy of Sir John
                  Warren, takes possession of l'Isle Dieu (sic).
                  A French squadron of six sail of the line falls in
                  with a valuable British convoy from the
                  Mediterranean, and captures the Censeur, a 74 gun
                  ship, and several merchantmen.
                  Vernier, the organ of the committee of finances,
                  proposes to substitute money made of some metal in
                  the place of 18 milliards of assignats in
                  circulation.
                  The inhabitants of Versailles supplicate the
                  convention to take into consideration the sad state
                  of their commune.
                  A horrible picture is laid before the convention of
                  massacres in the South; the banks of the Rhone and
                  of the Durance are said to be covered with dead
                  carcases, upon which the dogs are feeding.
                  Garnier de Saintes addresses from the tribune the
                  royalists of France.  "Insects," (says he) "return
                  "to your nothingness; ye shall perish, whilst we
                  "shall be masters of the world, with which we will
                  "share our fortune and our liberty."
                  Tallien prophesies, that before three months a
                  counter-revolution will be effected; and he
                  therefore advises his colleagues to make their
                  political testament.
                  Thibadeau immediately accuses Tallien of all the
                  calamities of the  revolution.
                  Clairfait and Wurmser compel the French to repass
                  the Rhine precipitately, and obtain great
                  advantages over them.
                  Baudin, the organ of the committees of government,
                  proposes to the convention to adopt a plan of a
                  general amnesty for any act regarding the
                  revolution, excepting always the banished priests,
                  the emigrants, the fabricators of forged assignats,
                  and the assassins of the South.
                  As to the punishment of death, it is not to be
                  abolished till peace be established.
             24.  Rewbell pretends that the new government cannot
                  establish itself but by calling in the assignats,
                  and substituting an augmentation of taxes.
                  The convention, having proclaimed an amnesty,
                  declares its sittings at an end; and to make up the
                  500 members who are to remain, it constitutes
                  itself into an electoral body.
                  Le Bon is condemned to death by the criminal
                  tribunal of Amiens.
                  The colonists of St. Domingo, who are at Paris,
                  nominate their deputies to the new legislature.
             26.  From the 12th to the end of this month the
                  Austrians continue without ceasing to pursue the
                  French, and to destroy them in great numbers.

CHAPTER IV.

                  THE new legislature, or fourth assembly of the
                  French, enters upon its office.  It is composed of
                  a legislative body of 500 members; of a council of
                  ancients 250; of an executive directory of 5
                  members; and of 6 ministers, viz. for the interior
                  department, for the war, for justice, for the
                  admiralty, for foreign affairs, and for finances.
                  The five members of the executive directory are, La
                  Reveillere, le Paux, la Tourneur, Carnot, Rewbell,
                  and Barras; all ex-deputies of the national
                  convention.
Nov.            The legislative body is employed in discussing a
                  decree passed in the last sitting of the
                  convention, which imposed a tax of six milliards on
                  the landed property, and two milliards upon
                  industry.
                  The criminal tribunal acquits Gen. Menon, suspected
                  of having taken part in the, rebellion of the
                  sections.
                  The depreciation of assignats is at this time so
                  great, that a pair of shoes costs 300 livres, a
                  yard of cloth 3000, a bushel of potatoes 120, a
                  pound of bread 40, a pound of coffee and of sugar
                  175, a pound of candles and of soap 80 livres each;
                  a louis-d'or is worth 4,600 livres.
                  The executive directory obtains a grant of three
                  milliards, to be at its discretion distributed
                  among the different offices.
                  The subsistence of Paris not being assured, it is
                  decreed, that 250 quintals (each 100lbs. weight) be
                  levied on the departments bordering on Paris.
                  The Cape of Good-Hope is taken by the English.
                  The trial of Comartin, one of the chiefs of the
                  Chouans, occupies at present the military tribunal,
                  and all Paris.
                  The republican generals, and many deputies of the
                  convention are implicated in this affair.
                  A ship full of emigrants, among whom are the Duke
                  de Choiseul and the Count de Montmorency, is driven
                  by a tempest into Calais.  They are given up to the
                  criminal tribunal of that city.
                  Besides the sum above granted to the executive
                  directory, twenty-one millions more are allowed to
                  them.  Thirty millions more added for the expences
                  of the legislative body.

RESULT OF THE THIRD SCRUTINY.

PRESIDENT VERGNIAULT.

"CITIZENS!

     "I am going to pronounce the sentence of rigour against Louis.
"When justice has spoken, humanity should then make her voice heard.
"I intreat the members and the tribune to observe profound silence.
"The assembly is composed of 745 members: 1 of these is dead--6 are
"sick--2 absent without assigning any reason--11 are absent with
"leave--4 have not voted; the total is 24, which, being deducted
"from 745, there remain 721 voters, of whom the absolute majority is
"361.

 "36 are for death, leaving the time of it to be discussed hereafter.
  "9 for death, with respite.
  "2 for death, after a peace.
  "2 for chains.
"319 for confinement.
"366 for death.

"CITIZENS,

"The punishment pronounced against Louis is DEATH."

******

THE APPEAL OF LOUIS XVI.

"I OWE it to my honour, I owe it to my family, not to subscribe to an "accusation which I have
not merited.  I declare therefore, that I "bring an appeal to the nation at large from the
judgment passed "against me; and I give to my defenders all necessary powers, in "order that
this present appeal may be inserted in the Journals of "the Convention."

Refused!

The ADDRESS of Mons. DE SEZE, one of the defenders of the King, to the Convention.

         "THE ratification by the French people, which Louis demands,
"is the exercise of a natural and sacred right which belongs to
"every person accused; it is the right of every man, and
"consequently of Louis.  If we did not prefer this claim in his
"defence, it was because it was not in our power to foresee that the
"National Convention would resolve upon judging him; or, if it did
"judge him, that it would condemn him.  We now learn, that the fatal
"decree, which condemns Louis to death, has been carried by a
"majority of five votes only.  Permit me, Citizens, to represent to
"you, in the name of humanity, in the name of that sacred principle
"which calls for every mitigation in favour of the accused, that this
"circumstance, so very extraordinary, may well engage you
"voluntarily to accede to the proposed ratification.  I demand it in
"the name of justice, in the name of our country, in the name of
"humanity.  Exercise your own high powers; but do not astonish France
"by the exhibition of a judgment that must appear terrible, when the
"surprising minority comes to be considered.

         "Citizens, permit me to adjure you once more in the name of
"Louis XVI. and to conclude with suggesting to you, whether, whilst
"you are contending for the security of the nation, and its real
"interest, you will not tremble, when you reflect, that the safety of
"the republic, the Security of the French empire, and the happiness
"of 25 millions of people, may possibly depend upon five votes."

******

FOURTH APPEL NOMINAL.

         THE object of this fourth appeal was to know whether the
execution of Louis might be deferred; 310 were for respite, and 380
against it.  Thus, by a majority of 70 votes, it was decreed, that
the sentence against Louis XVI. should be executed without delay.

******

THE EXECUTION OF LOUIS XVI.

21st JANUARY, 1793.

         THE minister of justice and the heads of the administrative
corps, having proceeded to the Temple on Sunday the 20th of January,
about four in the evening, notified to Louis the warrant for his
execution.  "I demand," said the King, "a respite of three days to
"prepare myself for appearing before God.  To assist me in this work,
"I desire to have Mr. Edgeworth, (an Irish clergyman) with whom I may
"freely communicate.  I desire that he may be secured from all
"uneasiness, or apprehension, on account of this charitable office
"which he shall perform for me.  I desire to be relieved from that
"perpetual watch which the council-general has set over me for some
"days.  I demand in this interval the privilege of seeing my family
"when I shall desire it, and without witnesses.  I could also wish,
"that the Convention would, as speedily as may be, set about
"determining the fate of my family, and permit them to see each other
"freely and commodiously, when they shall think proper.

   "I recommend to the liberality of the nation all those persons who
"have been attached to me.  Among my pensioners there are many aged
"men, women, and children, who have no other means of subsistence."

   Of all there requisitions Louis obtained only that of seeing his
family without witnesses.  It was the first time since his
imprisonment.  The interview lasted two hours.  It is impossible to
express the horror of the moment, when he was obliged to tear himself
away from them.  On his return to his apartment, the King passed a
almost the whole of the night in prayer.  He then laid down and slept
a few hours, and early in the morning betook himself again to prayer.

   The 21st of January, at half past eight o'clock, Santerre, the
commandant-general, came to signify to Louis the order for his going
to execution.  Having requested three minutes to speak with his
confessor, he then turned to Santerre, and told him that he was ready
to follow him.

   The King crossed the first court of the Temple on foot; he then
entered the coach of Pethion, the mayor of Paris, with his Confessor
and two Gendarmes.  His route lay along, the Boulevards, which were
lined with above two hundred thousand men in arms.  All the way Louis
was deeply engaged in reading the prayers appointed for persons at
the point of death.

   Being, arrived at the Place de Louis XV. which was the place of
execution, about ten o'clock in the morning, he alighted from the
carriage with calmness, took off his clothes himself, remaining in
his white under-waistcoat, untied his cravat, and opened the collar
of his shirt; he then threw himself upon his knees to receive the
last benediction of his Confessor, got up immediately after, and
ascended the scaffold alone.  At that moment his Confessor cried out
to him, "Son of St. Louis, you are going up to Heaven!"  [Footnote;
Other accounts state, that it was when the King had just prepared
himself for the stroke of the fatal instrument, that Mons. Edgeworth,
his confessor, called out (in the imperative) with a loud voice,
"Enfant de Saint Louis, montez au Ciel."  "Son of St. Louis, mount up
"to Heaven."]

Far from opposing those who came to cut off his hair, and bind his hands, " Do with me," said
he, "what you will, it is the last "sacrifice."  He then made a motion with his hand to obtain
"silence.--"I die perfectly innocent of all the pretended crimes laid "to my charge--I forgive
all those who have had any hand in my "misfortunes, and I pray that my blood may be of use
in restoring "happiness to France--and you, unhappy people!" ......

   At these words, the unfeeling Santerre gave orders that the drums
should beat, crying out to the King, "that he had not brought him
"there to declaim, but to die."  At that instant his head was severed
from his body! ......

   The corpse was immediately conveyed to the Magdalene
burying-ground, and thrown into a pit twelve feet deep, into which a
considerable quantity of quicklime was cast.

   It is said, that after crying out, "Vive la Nation!"
"Vive la Republique!" some volunteers dipped their pikes, and
others their handkerchiefs, in the blood of the victim.  One person
alone had the courage to cry out, Grace, and was instantly cut down
with a sabre.

   Thus died Louis XVI. King of France and Navarre.  He was born the
23d of August, 1754, ascended the throne the 10th of May, 1774, and
reigned eighteen years and three months.

been brought together and contrasted.

   21st April, 1770, Marriage of Louis at Vienna, and delivery of the
ring.

THE LAST WILL OF LOUIS XV1.

   IN the name of the most holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
this day, the 25th of December, 1792, I, Louis XVI. by name, King of
France, having been four months shut up with my family in the Tower
of the Temple, at Paris, by those who were my subjects, and
deprived of all communication whatever, even, since the 11th of this
month, with my family; being moreover involved in a trial, of which
it is impossible to foresee the issue, on account of the passions of
men, and for which there is no pretence nor motive in any existing
law, having none but God for witness to my thoughts, and to whom I
can address myself, I here declare, in his presence, my last will and
sentiments.

   I leave my soul to GOD my creator; I beseech him to receive it in
his mercy; not to judge it according to its merits, but to those of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered himself as a sacrifice to GOD his
Father for us men, unworthy of it as we are, and I more than any.

   I die in the faith of our holy mother the catholic, apostolic, and
Roman Church, which derives her powers in an uninterrupted succession
from St. Peter, to whom Jesus Christ had entrusted them; I firmly
believe and acknowledge all that is contained in the apostles'
creed, the commandments of God, and of the church; the sacraments and
mysteries, such the Catholic Church teaches, and has always taught
them; I never pretended, to be a judge of the different modes of
explaining the dogmas which divide the church of Jesus Christ; but I
have always trusted, and shall always trust, if God grants me life,
to the decisions that the ecclesiastical superiors, together with the
holy catholic church, give and shall give, according to the
discipline of the church since Jesus Christ.  I pity with all my
heart our brethren who may be in error, but I do not pretend to judge
them; nor do I love them the less in Jesus Christ, according to what
christian charity teaches us, and I pray God to forgive me all my
sins: I have scrupulously sought to know them, to detest them, and to
humble myself in his presence.  Not being permitted to make use of
the ministry of a catholic priest, I pray God to receive the
confession which I have made to him of them; and above all, my
sincere repentance for having put my name (though against my will) to
acts that may be contrary to the discipline and faith of the catholic
church, to which I have always been sincerely and faithfully united.
I pray God to accept my firm resolution, if he grants me life, to
make use as soon as possible of the ministry of a catholic priest,
that I may accuse myself of all my sins, and receive the sacrament of
penance.  I beseech all those whom I may have inadvertently offended,
(for I do not remember to have knowingly given offence to any person)
and those to whom I may have given bad examples, or caused scandal,
to forgive the injuries they think I may have done them.

   I implore all charitable persons to join their prayers to mine, to
obtain from God the pardon of my sins; I, with all my heart, forgive
those who are become my enemies, although I have not given them any
reason to be so; and I beseech God to forgive them, as well as those
who, through a false or mistaken zeal, have brought many misfortunes
on me.

   I recommend to God, my wife and children; my sisters, my aunts, my
brothers, and all those who are attached to me, either by the ties of
blood, or in any other way whatever.  I particularly beseech God to
cast a merciful eye on my wife, my children, and my sister, who have
long suffered with me, to support them by his grace, if they should
happen to lose me, and as long as they remain in this perishable
world.

   I recommend my children to my wife; I never doubted her maternal
tenderness for them.  I above all recommend to her to make them good
christians, and honest people; to make them consider the grandeurs of
this world (if they be condemned to possess them) only as dangerous
and perishable possessions, and to direct their attention to
Eternity, the only solid and durable glory.  I beg of my sister to
continue her tenderness to my children, and to be a mother to them,
if they should have the misfortune of losing her who is such.

   I intreat my wife to forgive me all the afflictions she suffers
for my sake, and the sorrows I may have given her in the course of
our union; as she may be certain that I have no fault to find with
her, even where she may think she has cause to reproach herself.

   I earnestly recommend to my children, after what they owe to God,
(which is the first of all duties) to live always in harmony with one
another, to be submissive and obedient to their mother, and grateful
to her for all the care and trouble she takes for them out of regard
to my memory.  I desire them to consider my sister as their second
mother.

   I recommend to my Son, if he has the misfortune to become King, to
remember that he owes himself entirely to his fellow citizens; that
he must forget all hatred and resentment, and particularly all that
relates to the misfortunes and afflictions that I endure; that he can
only make the people happy by reigning according to the laws, but at
the same time, that a King cannot make himself respected, and do all
the good he wishes, without having the necessary authority; and that
otherwise, being restrained in his operations, and not inspiring
respect, he is rather hurtful than useful.

   I recommend to my son to take as much care of all those persons
who were attached to me, as the circumstances he may be in will allow
him; to recollect that it is a sacred debt which I have contracted
towards the children or the relations of those who have died for me,
and those who suffer for my sake.  I know that there are several
persons among those who ought to have been attached to me, who have
not acted towards me as they ought, and have even been ungrateful
towards me; but I forgive them, (often in time of trouble and
confusion, men are not masters of themselves) and I beg my son, if he
finds the opportunity, to think only of their misfortunes.

   I wish I could here give a testimony of my gratitude to those who
have shown a true and disinterested affection for me.  If, on the one
hand, I have been sensibly affected with the ingratitude and
disloyalty of those, to whom I had shewn at all times only kindness
to them, their relations, or friends; on the other hand, I have had
the consolation to receive proofs of disinterested affection and
regard from several others.  I beg them to accept my best thanks.

   In the present state of things, I should fear to expose them if I
spoke more explicitly; but I particularly recommend to my son to
embrace every opportunity of discovering them.

   Nevertheless, I think I should wrong the national feeling, if I
were not openly to recommend to my son Messieurs De Chamilly and Hue,
whose sincere affection for me induced them to shut themselves up
with me in this melancholy abode, and who ran the risque (sic) of
being the unfortunate victims of their attachment.  I also recommend
Cleri, with whose attentions I have had all reasons to be satisfied
ever since he has been with me.  As he is the person who has remained
with me to the last, I request Messieurs de la Commune to give him my
clothes, my books, and the other trifles which have been deposited at
the Council of the Commune.

   I also very willingly forgive those who guarded me, for their ill
treatment, and the constraint which they thought necessary to keep me
under.  I have found some feeling and compassionate minds; may they
enjoy in their hearts the pleasure that their turn of thinking must
afford them.

   I request Messieurs De Malsherbes, Tronchet, and De Seze, to
receive my best thanks, and assurances of my gratitude for all the
care and attention they have shown me.

   I conclude with declaring before GOD, being ready to appear before
him, that I cannot reproach myself with any of those crimes that have
been laid to my charge.

   Made and copied in the Tower of the Temple, the 25th of December,
1792.

                                            (Signed)           LOUIS.

                        And undersigned BEAUDRAIS, Municipal Officer.
