The roof of the chancel is apsidal, externally, as well as the nave, covered with modern house
tiles.  Internally the nave has a flat ceiling of deal boards.  The pulpit and seats are painted
wainscot; there is a small modern oak reading desk, and a lectern to match it.  The chancel
arch is a plain semicircle, but on its eastern side has a pointed Early English arch.  The
chancel rails are of modern oak, slightly carved; and there is a deal credence table.  The
14th century font has a massive octagonal bowl, with large trefoils in each face, and grotesquely
carved heads at the angles; the shaft being plain octagonal.  The improvements were made in
1896, at the cost of the late Mrs. Stanhope.

The register dates from 1562.  In recent years the incumbency of Claxby Pluckacre, where the
church had gone to ruins, has been annexed to the rectory of Wilksby, the joint value of the
two being about £300 a year. They are held by the Rev. P. O. Ashby, Chaplain of Revesby.

LANGRIVILLE & THORNTON-LE-FEN.

These are modern accretions to the Soke of Horncastle, made in the early years of the 19th
century.  They are distant southward from Horncastle about 13 miles; situated in a tract of
land called Wildmore Fen, lying about midway between Coningsby to the north, and Boston to
the south.  At various periods inundated by the sea, this continued, to the end of the 18th
century, more or less a region of morass; available in the summer for grazing, but generally
during the winter under water; when all cattle had to be removed for safety to the lands under
cultivation at the homesteads of the farmers; and if by chance the farmer was behindhand in
removing them, and the floods became frozen, it was a common thing for his cattle, while slipping
about on the ice, to be split up, or, as it was locally termed, “screeved,” and so become helpless,
and fit only for slaughter. {209}

An Act of Parliament was passed in 1787 or 1788, and commissioners were appointed, for the
drainage of this and adjoining similar tracts; but little was done until 1800, when the able
engineer, Mr. John Rennie, submitted his plans for the drainage to the commissioners.  His
first report, dated April 7th, 1800, estimated the cost of draining Wildmore Fen alone at £29,702;
the total outlay, for that and adjoining fens, being put at nearly £215,000.  By 1812 these
operations were completed; and in that year an Act was passed making these lands parochial,
and assigning the two portions above named to the Soke of Horncastle.

LANGRIVILLE.

Langriville, so called because it is near Langrick (or Long Creek) on the Witham, has an area
of 2,514 acres, including Langrick Ferry; rateable value £3,300.  The population is entirely
engaged in agriculture.  The nearest railway station is at Langrick, in the parish.

It consists of the southern portion of Wildmore Fen, which at the enclosure was allotted to
the Earl of Stamford and Warrington, in lieu of his manorial rights over Armtree and Wildmore;
with other lands sold by the Drainage Commissioners, early in the 19th century.  The Earl’s
estates afterwards passed, by purchase, to the late J. Fretwell Bramley and others.  The present
Lord of the Manor is Lord Malcolm, of Poltallock; and he, the Rector of Coningsby, the executors
of Lady Ingram Watkin, J. Linton, Esq., of Stirtcoe, Buckden, Herts., Harrison Hayter, Esq.,
W. Goodenough Hayter, Esq., Mr. Jonathan Fox, of Boston, E. Harrison, Esq., and Mr. William
Pepper are the largest land owners.

A small brick church was erected in 1831, consisting of nave, chancel and bell turret; and
repaired and improved in 1885, by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.  The Bishop of Lincoln
is patron; and the Rev. W. Fitz-Harry Curtis is the incumbent, who has here a residence, with
an income of £320 a year.

The Wesleyans have a chapel at Langrick Ferry, also in Armtree Road.  By an order in council,
dated 26th August, 1881, Langriville and Thornton-le-Fen were united, under the title of “The
Consolidated Chapelry of Wildmore.”  There is a church at each place.  At the time of the enclosure
fen allotments were assigned to various of the older parishes, and these are many of them now
included in this modern district, comprising parts of Fishtoft Fen, of Coningsby, of Kirkstead,
Scrivelsby, Woodhall, Dalderby, and Martin.  The entire area is now 10,500 acres, and population
1,470.

The National School, erected in 1857, is at Gipsy Bridge, now under a School Board.

THORNTON-LE-FEN.

Thornton-le-Fen adjoins Langriville, lying to the east of it, about three miles from Langrick
railway station.  The area was originally about 1,425 acres, including Bunkers Hill, part of
Gipsy Bridge, and other scattered farms, which were sold by the Drainage Commissioners early
in the 19th century, when it was made, by Act of Parliament, a parochial township. Rateable
value £1,979.  It has its name from the former chief proprietors, the Thornton family; but
the chief land owners now are Lord Malcolm of Poltalloch, the Pepper, Ireland, Creasey, Ward,
and Wilcock families.  The soil is clay, and very fertile.

The church, which was built on the Fen Chapel Estates in 1816, is a small brick building, containing
200 sittings; the benefice, valued at £100 a year, is in the gift of the Bishop of Lincoln,
and by order in council, dated 26th August, 1881, was consolidated with the chapelry of Langriville;
the two being of the united yearly value of £320, and held by the Rev. W. Fitz-Harry Curtis,
who resides at the latter place.

A good school and master’s house were erected in 1880, by the School Board of Wildmore Fen,
at a cost of about £1,200, to accommodate 168 children.  The Wesleyans have a chapel at New
York and Bunkers’ Hill. The Primitive Methodists have also a chapel.

The Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to whom the Fen Chapel Estates were transferred in 1876,
pay £120 a year for a curate, who now is the Rev. Harold E. Curtis.  The total area is now
10,500 acres, and population 1,470.

NOTE.—Other parishes have once been in the Soke of Horncastle, which no longer belong to it.
Domesday Book gives Scrivelsby, “Langton and (its) Thorpe” (from which I write; “Thorpe” being
doubtless the outlying district recently known as Langton St. Andrew), and also Edlington.
How these became separated is not known.  As suggested by the author of Scrivelsby, the home
of the Champions, Scrivelsby, as a barony of the Marmyon and Dymoke families, would probably
be separated by payment of a fine; such powerful families preferring not to be sub-ordinated
to another manor.  Several Dymokes, however, were buried at Horncastle, where are their monuments.
