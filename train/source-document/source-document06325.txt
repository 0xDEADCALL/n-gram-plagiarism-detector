SUSSEX GODS.

  I have been told, and do not doubt,
    That Devon lanes are dim with trees,
    And shagged with fern, and loved of bees,
  And all with roses pranked about;
  I do believe that other-where
  The woods are green, the meadows fair.

  And woods, I know, have always been
    The haunt of fairies, good or grim;
    There the knight-errant hasted him;
  There Bottom found King Oberon's Queen;
  The Enchanted Castle always stood
  Deep in the shadow of a wood.

  But I know upland spirits too
    Who love the shadeless downs to climb;
    There, in the far-off fabled time,
  Men called them when the moon was new,
  And built them little huts of stone
  With briar and thistle over-grown.

  The trees are few and do not bend
    To make a whispering swaying arch;
    They are the elder and the larch,
  Who have the north-east wind for friend,
  And shield them from his bluff salute
  With elbow kinked and moss-girt root.

  There, when the clear Spring sunset dies
    Like a great pearl dissolved in wine,
    Forgotten stragglers half-divine
  Creep to their ancient sanctuaries
  Where salt-sweet thyme and sorrel-spire
  Feed on the dust of ancient fire.

  And when the light is almost dead,
    Low-swung and loose the brown clouds flow
    In an unhasting happy row
  Out seaward over Beachy Head,
  Where, far below, the faithful sea
  Mutters its wordless liturgy;

  Then Sussex gods of sky and sun,
    Gods never worshipped in a grove,
    Walk on the hills they used to love,
  Where the Long Man of Wilmington,
  Warden of their old frontier, stands
  And welcomes them with sceptred hands.

WHEN THE CHESTNUT FLOWERS.

FAMOUS FOLK WHO VISIT HAMPTON COURT.

(Specially contributed by our mendacious Paragraphical Expert after the best models.)

Wonderful is the lure that Cardinal WOLSEY'S ancient seat has for all classes of Londoners,
especially now when the spires of pink and yellow blossoms rise amidst the dark foliage of
Bushey Park, but it is not generally known how many celebrities of the day are attracted to
Hampton Court Palace unobserved by anybody but me, who make a habit of noticing this kind of
thing. Leaders in the worlds of politics and art wander on the closely-shaven lawns or through
the stately chambers, where our English kings made their home and in most cases left their
bedsteads behind for posterity to admire. It is as if some irresistible compulsion drove the
great minds of the present to commune with the mighty shades of the past. Either that or because
the return fare from Waterloo is comparatively cheap.

Paying my penny to visit the Great Vine the other day, I found myself alone in the conservatory
with none other than the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER himself, who was regarding this magnificent
specimen of horticulture with evident interest through his monocle. After mentioning to him
that its record output was twenty-two hundred clusters, I could not resist the temptation of
asking him whether he thought the manufacture of home-grown wines would be stimulated by the
provisions of the present Budget. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, however, returned an evasive reply and went
out to join Sir EDWARD CARSON, who was pacing up and down in front of the Orangery.

Other well-known politicians whom I have noticed here lately have been Lord BEATTY and Lord
FISHER strolling arm-in-arm beside the Long Canal, and Mr. JACK JONES looking contemptuously
at the Kynge's Beestes; and the other day, owing to identical errors in our choice of routes,
I bumped into Sir ERIC GEDDES no fewer than five times during one afternoon in the Maze. The
LORD CHANCELLOR is another frequent visitor. For one who has the mitigation of the harsher
features of our marriage laws so much at heart, these Courts, where "bluff KING HAL" celebrated
so many of his cheeriest weddings, have a special charm. It is true that the eighth Henry was
a little one-sided in his ideas of reform, but that was the fault of his age rather than himself,
and, like the present National Party, he had, as the LORD CHANCELLOR put it, the great heart
of the people behind him.

Nor is it only statesmen who haunt the great palace. Nowhere else but here, where JAMES I.'S
company of actors, including WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, performed, can Mr. HENRY AINLEY obtain the
requisite atmosphere which inspires his swift variety of impersonations, and I am told that
his sudden remark of, "Oh, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth," made to one of the attendants
who had been for many years in the army, was nearly the cause of a slight fracas. Mr. H. G.
WELLS has sometimes been seen staring open-mouthed at the painting of the Olympian cosmogony
which adorns the ceiling and walls of the Grand Staircase, and in the wych-elm bower Sir J.
M. BARRIE tells me that he often thinks out the titles of his new plays. It was here, in fact,
whilst he was weighing the delicate question, "Why did Alice-Sit-By-the-Fire?" that the sudden
happy answer occurred to him, "Because Mary Rose."

MY STRONG SUIT.

  Not for me the profiteer's
        Lucky hauls,
  But a prospect of lean years
        That appals;
  Yet, although I dimly grope
  On an ever downward slope,
  I espy one gleam of hope--
        Overalls.

  When the experts prophesy
        Further squalls,
  And my income, never high,
        Falls and falls,
  Then the twenty-guinea suit
  Is to me forbidden fruit,
  But I cordially salute
        Overalls.

  Not to mention other woes,
        Other calls,
  Paying tailors through the nose
        Greatly galls;
  So farewell, expensive tweeds,
  Though my manly bosom bleeds,
  For the situation needs
        Overalls.

A Legacy of the War.

No one will lightly forget the noble services rendered by the Y.W.C.A. to our troops and those
of our Allies during the War, and many of Mr. Punch's friends must have given practical expression
to their gratitude. But we are liable to forget that the end of the War has not brought an
end either to the work of the Y.W.C.A. or to the claim which that work has upon our recognition.
There is pressing need of accommodation and protection and healthy environment for the large
army of girls who have been demobilized and are now engaged in, or seeking for, civilian employment.
The funds of the Y.W.C.A. do not admit of the establishment and maintenance of sufficient hostels
for this good purpose. At the moment a chance is offered to them of purchasing a large, suitable
and perfectly-equipped house--rented during the War, and after, by the Y.W.C.A.--in a densely-populated
district in South London. The offer holds good for only a few days, and, if it is not taken,
over two hundred girls will be turned adrift to wander in search of lodgings. The price is
thirty thousand pounds. It is difficult to think of any cause to which money could be more
usefully subscribed. Mr. Punch begs his readers to send to the promoters of this good work
some token of their sympathy and appreciation. Gifts should be addressed to the Hon. Emily
Kinnaird, 4, Duke Street, W.1.

THE TOW-ROPE GIRLS.

  Oh, a ship in the Tropics a-foaming along,
  With every stitch drawing, the Trade blowing strong,
  The white caps around her all breaking in spray,
  For the girls have got hold of her tow-rope to-day.

  (And it's "Haul away, girls, steady an' true,
  Polly an' Dolly an' Sally an' Sue,
  Mothers an' sisters an' sweethearts an' all,
  Haul away, all the way, haul away, haul!")

  She's logging sixteen as she speeds from the South,
  The wind in her royals, a bone in her mouth;
  With a wake like a mill-race she rolls on her way,
  For the girls have got hold of her tow-rope to-day.

  The old man he stood on the poop at high noon;
  He paced fore and aft and he whistled a tune;
  Then put by his sextant and thus he did say,
  "The girls have got hold of our tow-rope to-day.

  "Of cargoes and charters we've had our full share,
  Of grain and of lumber enough and to spare,
  Of nitrates at Taltal and rice for Bombay,
  And the girls have got hold of our tow-rope to-day.

  "She has dipped her yards under, hove-to off the Horn;
  In the fog and the floes she has drifted forlorn;
  Becalmed in the doldrums a week long she lay,
  But the girls have got hold of her tow-rope to-day!"

  Oh, hear the good Trade-wind a-singing aloud
  His homeward-bound chantey in sheet and in shroud;
  Oh, hear how he whistles in halliard and stay,
  "The girls have got hold of the tow-rope to-day!"
