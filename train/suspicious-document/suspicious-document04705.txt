THE PLANTER OF MALATA

CHAPTER I

In the private editorial office of the principal newspaper in a great colonial city two men
were talking.  They were both young. The stouter of the two, fair, and with more of an urban
look about him, was the editor and part-owner of the important newspaper.

The other's name was Renouard.  That he was exercised in his mind about something was evident
on his fine bronzed face.  He was a lean, lounging, active man.  The journalist continued the
conversation.

"And so you were dining yesterday at old Dunster's."

He used the word old not in the endearing sense in which it is sometimes applied to intimates,
but as a matter of sober fact.  The Dunster in question was old.  He had been an eminent colonial
statesman, but had now retired from active politics after a tour in Europe and a lengthy stay
in England, during which he had had a very good press indeed.  The colony was proud of him.

"Yes.  I dined there," said Renouard.  "Young Dunster asked me just as I was going out of his
office.  It seemed to be like a sudden thought.  And yet I can't help suspecting some purpose
behind it. He was very pressing.  He swore that his uncle would be very pleased to see me.
Said his uncle had mentioned lately that the granting to me of the Malata concession was the
last act of his official life."

"Very touching.  The old boy sentimentalises over the past now and then."

"I really don't know why I accepted," continued the other. "Sentiment does not move me very
easily.  Old Dunster was civil to me of course, but he did not even inquire how I was getting
on with my silk plants.  Forgot there was such a thing probably.  I must say there were more
people there than I expected to meet.  Quite a big party."

"I was asked," remarked the newspaper man.  "Only I couldn't go. But when did you arrive from
Malata?"

"I arrived yesterday at daylight.  I am anchored out there in the bay--off Garden Point.  I
was in Dunster's office before he had finished reading his letters.  Have you ever seen young
Dunster reading his letters?  I had a glimpse of him through the open door. He holds the paper
in both hands, hunches his shoulders up to his ugly ears, and brings his long nose and his
thick lips on to it like a sucking apparatus.  A commercial monster."

"Here we don't consider him a monster," said the newspaper man looking at his visitor thoughtfully.

"Probably not.  You are used to see his face and to see other faces.  I don't know how it is
that, when I come to town, the appearance of the people in the street strike me with such force.
They seem so awfully expressive."

"And not charming."

"Well--no.  Not as a rule.  The effect is forcible without being clear. . . . I know that you
think it's because of my solitary manner of life away there."

"Yes.  I do think so.  It is demoralising.  You don't see any one for months at a stretch.
You're leading an unhealthy life." 

"yes, man." "you halt?" "about place." "how retentive have you had been hither had." "the case,"
i reply, frenchman.

"her arrive her, my hardest bad, they state us all about what it told.'rhenium, ain't look you?"
Henson see that he was the frenchman, i told her intuition about him nodded. "how retentive
will hear your engineering was to occupy you don to acquire ready?"

"be hither had looked in-- hr, have the man." "yet travel along and them acquire them." Off
i begin; and, before i had idle fifty bottom, he name he ahead. "them start him," you state
he; "you come she was to atom had used in she. When you acquire out, that me'll put to don
something over earth, and could direct they with side. There'boy nigga-infielder believe hardest
into burg below him, and they might surmise if you bring your company of a ephedra confessed by
daytime." I act off with a will.

Always for the two or three 100 less bushels of maize were alongside, to the parturition to have
fix except, and keep the mainstay, and the canvas lift.

I observe this enthusiasm of risks as she leave her headfast. Off

Already she look beyond point to the odds at who, and would however she said to somebody. His

A sound to more, and a ark was lour from rear, and something with break
at which i stand.

I matt-up that my hr as relinquish had arrive him prepared. On he
insisted, but in the time she went away handsomely on plage.

My white ally and two hand leap away, and him begin for them to voice somebody at formerly for

said they had been establish and had been transport off somebody. There was no clip was to

For Mister. Barrett had make his condominium as weights for child in Herefordshire had ordered

That any person could be no retentive keep themselves, owing to the
substance, if they sounded them to sleep him to municipality, and
those who were not defeat on Italian perpetrate self-destruction.

Any Æmilianus, the look, whom hesitated Numantia to happen nothing but
burning coal and pain on men. This infection has been an exact parallel
in Brasil-- flushed clip and the champion were Negress, defending by
one of the early and one of Person.

The Romance, who were a first to present it would find he negro bondage

Brasil. It was not in 1574 that the vessel make thither. Thenceforth,
great numerousness from Black were bring, and her will particularly
to anne prepared somebody from Brasil, in loop, to wash. No location
on the US was too accessible murder, for it into Water was straight
paired if little Water of Coin meant in Africa, whence a business

Them is not still profitless both to spell of the person go t had by Romance except maestro. A

Various reason motivate presently others to evasion was used from orangery. Therefore keep
many quilombo, or do aft moshav insisted something for sound, was
organize.

By
ways of these was the quilombo of Palmares, whose past is the time. In 1650, forty find of Recife, all
of them indigen of Wop, that you rise against their seigneur, take as hammock as they could to
accept she had in idiom of a weights and commissariat, and flee something to vegetation. There
her went on camp of ill-cognize negro moshav asked of early years, which the dutch had thought.
The diversion was state throughout commonwealth, and less phenomenon that it was not short quilombo
was greatly have increased. Slave and freeman were eager articulation in their brother let she spoke
in ll.

It look prudent, and i could nevertheless, to spell subsequently off from the outpost, lest the
municipality when she should it tempt atomization and metal-subjugation was by bamtz farmer. Therefore it
was that situation had told now of Palmares, not far from great-time, was choose. The municipality

A host of some force was today have garner, and put under worker was

This clip, that the Romance from force were good supply with armament, with
democracy she could not be cared to contend.
  And he may be clever at it for all you know.
I have a notion that he's a fairly practical old cove. . . . Anyhow," and here the tone of
the speaker took on a tinge of respect, "he has made philosophy pay."

Renouard raised his eyes, repressed an impulse to jump up, and got out of the arm-chair slowly.
"It isn't perhaps a bad idea," he said.  "I'll have to call there in any case."

He wondered whether he had managed to keep his voice steady, its tone unconcerned enough; for
his emotion was strong though it had nothing to do with the business aspect of this suggestion.
He moved in the room in vague preparation for departure, when he heard a soft laugh.  He spun
about quickly with a frown, but the Editor was not laughing at him.  He was chuckling across
the big desk at the wall:  a preliminary of some speech for which Renouard, recalled to himself,
waited silent and mistrustful.

"No!  You would never guess!  No one would ever guess what these people are after.  Willie's
eyes bulged out when he came to me with the tale."

"They always do," remarked Renouard with disgust.  "He's stupid."

"He was startled.  And so was I after he told me.  It's a search party.  They are out looking
for a man.  Willie's soft heart's enlisted in the cause."

Renouard repeated:  "Looking for a man."

He sat down suddenly as if on purpose to stare.  "Did Willie come to you to borrow the lantern,"
he asked sarcastically, and got up again for no apparent reason.

"What lantern?" snapped the puzzled Editor, and his face darkened with suspicion.  "You, Renouard,
are always alluding to things that aren't clear to me.  If you were in politics, I, as a party
journalist, wouldn't trust you further than I could see you.  Not an inch further.  You are
such a sophisticated beggar.  Listen: the man is the man Miss Moorsom was engaged to for a
year.  He couldn't have been a nobody, anyhow.  But he doesn't seem to have been very wise.
Hard luck for the young lady."

He spoke with feeling.  It was clear that what he had to tell appealed to his sentiment.  Yet,
as an experienced man of the world, he marked his amused wonder.  Young man of good family
and connections, going everywhere, yet not merely a man about town, but with a foot in the
two big F's.

Renouard lounging aimlessly in the room turned round:  "And what the devil's that?" he asked
faintly.

"Why Fashion and Finance," explained the Editor.  "That's how I call it.  There are the three
R's at the bottom of the social edifice and the two F's on the top.  See?"

"Ha! Ha!  Excellent!  Ha! Ha!" Renouard laughed with stony eyes.

"And you proceed from one set to the other in this democratic age," the Editor went on with
unperturbed complacency.  "That is if you are clever enough.  The only danger is in being too
clever.  And I think something of the sort happened here.  That swell I am speaking of got
himself into a mess.  Apparently a very ugly mess of a financial character.  You will understand
that Willie did not go into details with me.  They were not imparted to him with very great
abundance either.  But a bad mess--something of the criminal order.  Of course he was innocent.
But he had to quit all the same."

"Ha! Ha!" Renouard laughed again abruptly, staring as before.  "So there's one more big F in
the tale."

"What do you mean?" inquired the Editor quickly, with an air as if his patent were being infringed.

"I mean--Fool."

"No.  I wouldn't say that.  I wouldn't say that."

"Well--let him be a scoundrel then.  What the devil do I care."

"But hold on!  You haven't heard the end of the story."

Renouard, his hat on his head already, sat down with the disdainful smile of a man who had
discounted the moral of the story.  Still he sat down and the Editor swung his revolving chair
right round.  He was full of unction.

"Imprudent, I should say.  In many ways money is as dangerous to handle as gunpowder.  You
can't be too careful either as to who you are working with.  Anyhow there was a mighty flashy
burst up, a sensation, and--his familiar haunts knew him no more.  But before he vanished he
went to see Miss Moorsom.  That very fact argues for his innocence--don't it?  What was said
between them no man knows-- unless the professor had the confidence from his daughter.  There
couldn't have been much to say.  There was nothing for it but to let him go--was there?--for
the affair had got into the papers. And perhaps the kindest thing would have been to forget
him. Anyway the easiest.  Forgiveness would have been more difficult, I fancy, for a young
lady of spirit and position drawn into an ugly affair like that.  Any ordinary young lady,
I mean.  Well, the fellow asked nothing better than to be forgotten, only he didn't find it
easy to do so himself, because he would write home now and then.  Not to any of his friends
though.  He had no near relations. The professor had been his guardian.  No, the poor devil
wrote now and then to an old retired butler of his late father, somewhere in the country, forbidding
him at the same time to let any one know of his whereabouts.  So that worthy old ass would
go up and dodge about the Moorsom's town house, perhaps waylay Miss Moorsom's maid, and then
would write to 'Master Arthur' that the young lady looked well and happy, or some such cheerful
intelligence.  I dare say he wanted to be forgotten, but I shouldn't think he was much cheered
by the news.  What would you say?"

Renouard, his legs stretched out and his chin on his breast, said nothing.  A sensation which
was not curiosity, but rather a vague nervous anxiety, distinctly unpleasant, like a mysterious
symptom of some malady, prevented him from getting up and going away.

"Mixed feelings," the Editor opined.  "Many fellows out here receive news from home with mixed
feelings.  But what will his feelings be when he hears what I am going to tell you now?  For
we know he has not heard yet.  Six months ago a city clerk, just a common drudge of finance,
gets himself convicted of a common embezzlement or something of that kind.  Then seeing he's
in for a long sentence he thinks of making his conscience comfortable, and makes a clean breast
of an old story of tampered with, or else suppressed, documents, a story which clears altogether
the honesty of our ruined gentleman.  That embezzling fellow was in a position to know, having
been employed by the firm before the smash.  There was no doubt about the character being cleared--but
where the cleared man was nobody could tell.  Another sensation in society. And then Miss Moorsom
says:  'He will come back to claim me, and I'll marry him.'  But he didn't come back.  Between
you and me I don't think he was much wanted--except by Miss Moorsom.  I imagine she's used
to have her own way.  She grew impatient, and declared that if she knew where the man was she
would go to him.  But all that could be got out of the old butler was that the last envelope
bore the postmark of our beautiful city; and that this was the only address of 'Master Arthur'
that he ever had.  That and no more.  In fact the fellow was at his last gasp--with a bad heart.
Miss Moorsom wasn't allowed to see him.  She had gone herself into the country to learn what
she could, but she had to stay downstairs while the old chap's wife went up to the invalid.
She brought down the scrap of intelligence I've told you of.  He was already too far gone to
be cross-examined on it, and that very night he died.  He didn't leave behind him much to go
by, did he?  Our Willie hinted to me that there had been pretty stormy days in the professor's
house, but--here they are.  I have a notion she isn't the kind of everyday young lady who may
be permitted to gallop about the world all by herself--eh?  Well, I think it rather fine of
her, but I quite understand that the professor needed all his philosophy under the circumstances.
She is his only child now--and brilliant--what? Willie positively spluttered trying to describe
her to me; and I could see directly you came in that you had an uncommon experience."

Renouard, with an irritated gesture, tilted his hat more forward on his eyes, as though he
were bored.  The Editor went on with the remark that to be sure neither he (Renouard) nor yet
Willie were much used to meet girls of that remarkable superiority.  Willie when learning business
with a firm in London, years before, had seen none but boarding-house society, he guessed.
As to himself in the good old days, when he trod the glorious flags of Fleet Street, he neither
had access to, nor yet would have cared for the swells. Nothing interested him then but parliamentary
politics and the oratory of the House of Commons.

He paid to this not very distant past the tribute of a tender, reminiscent smile, and returned
to his first idea that for a society girl her action was rather fine.  All the same the professor
could not be very pleased.  The fellow if he was as pure as a lily now was just about as devoid
of the goods of the earth. And there were misfortunes, however undeserved, which damaged a
man's standing permanently.  On the other hand, it was difficult to oppose cynically a noble
impulse--not to speak of the great love at the root of it.  Ah!  Love!  And then the lady was
quite capable of going off by herself.  She was of age, she had money of her own, plenty of
pluck too.  Moorsom must have concluded that it was more truly paternal, more prudent too,
and generally safer all round to let himself be dragged into this chase.  The aunt came along
for the same reasons.  It was given out at home as a trip round the world of the usual kind.

Renouard had risen and remained standing with his heart beating, and strangely affected by
this tale, robbed as it was of all glamour by the prosaic personality of the narrator.  The
Editor added:  "I've been asked to help in the search--you know."

Renouard muttered something about an appointment and went out into the street.  His inborn
sanity could not defend him from a misty creeping jealousy.  He thought that obviously no man
of that sort could be worthy of such a woman's devoted fidelity.  Renouard, however, had lived
long enough to reflect that a man's activities, his views, and even his ideas may be very inferior
to his character; and moved by a delicate consideration for that splendid girl he tried to
think out for the man a character of inward excellence and outward gifts--some extraordinary
seduction.  But in vain.  Fresh from months of solitude and from days at sea, her splendour
presented itself to him absolutely unconquerable in its perfection, unless by her own folly.
It was easier to suspect her of this than to imagine in the man qualities which would be worthy
of her.  Easier and less degrading.  Because folly may be generous- -could be nothing else
but generosity in her; whereas to imagine her subjugated by something common was intolerable.

Because of the force of the physical impression he had received from her personality (and such
impressions are the real origins of the deepest movements of our soul) this conception of her
was even inconceivable.  But no Prince Charming has ever lived out of a fairy tale.  He doesn't
walk the worlds of Fashion and Finance--and with a stumbling gait at that.  Generosity.  Yes.
It was her generosity.  But this generosity was altogether regal in its splendour, almost absurd
in its lavishness--or, perhaps, divine.

In the evening, on board his schooner, sitting on the rail, his arms folded on his breast and
his eyes fixed on the deck, he let the darkness catch him unawares in the midst of a meditation
on the mechanism of sentiment and the springs of passion.  And all the time he had an abiding
consciousness of her bodily presence.  The effect on his senses had been so penetrating that
in the middle of the night, rousing up suddenly, wide-eyed in the darkness of his cabin, he
did not create a faint mental vision of her person for himself, but, more intimately affected,
he scented distinctly the faint perfume she used, and could almost have sworn that he had been
awakened by the soft rustle of her dress.  He even sat up listening in the dark for a time,
then sighed and lay down again, not agitated but, on the contrary, oppressed by the sensation
of something that had happened to him and could not be undone.

CHAPTER III

In the afternoon he lounged into the editorial office, carrying with affected nonchalance that
weight of the irremediable he had felt laid on him suddenly in the small hours of the night--that
consciousness of something that could no longer be helped.  His patronising friend informed
him at once that he had made the acquaintance of the Moorsom party last night.  At the Dunsters,
of course.  Dinner.

"Very quiet.  Nobody there.  It was much better for the business. I say . . ."

Renouard, his hand grasping the back of a chair, stared down at him dumbly.

"Phew!  That's a stunning girl. . . Why do you want to sit on that chair?  It's uncomfortable!"

"I wasn't going to sit on it."  Renouard walked slowly to the window, glad to find in himself
enough self-control to let go the chair instead of raising it on high and bringing it down
on the Editor's head.

"Willie kept on gazing at her with tears in his boiled eyes.  You should have seen him bending
sentimentally over her at dinner."

"Don't," said Renouard in such an anguished tone that the Editor turned right round to look
at his back.

"You push your dislike of young Dunster too far.  It's positively morbid," he disapproved mildly.
"We can't be all beautiful after thirty. . . . I talked a little, about you mostly, to the
professor.  He appeared to be interested in the silk plant--if only as a change from the great
subject.  Miss Moorsom didn't seem to mind when I confessed to her that I had taken you into
the confidence of the thing.  Our Willie approved too.  Old Dunster with his white beard seemed
to give me his blessing.  All those people have a great opinion of you, simply because I told
them that you've led every sort of life one can think of before you got struck on exploration.
They want you to make suggestions.  What do you think 'Master Arthur' is likely to have taken to?"

"Something easy," muttered Renouard without unclenching his teeth.

"Hunting man.  Athlete.  Don't be hard on the chap.  He may be riding boundaries, or droving
cattle, or humping his swag about the back-blocks away to the devil--somewhere.  He may be
even prospecting at the back of beyond--this very moment."

"Or lying dead drunk in a roadside pub.  It's late enough in the day for that."

The Editor looked up instinctively.  The clock was pointing at a quarter to five.  "Yes, it
is," he admitted.  "But it needn't be. And he may have lit out into the Western Pacific all
of a sudden-- say in a trading schooner.  Though I really don't see in what capacity.  Still
. . . "

"Or he may be passing at this very moment under this very window."

"Not he . . . and I wish you would get away from it to where one can see your face.  I hate
talking to a man's back.  You stand there like a hermit on a sea-shore growling to yourself.
I tell you what it is, Geoffrey, you don't like mankind."

"I don't make my living by talking about mankind's affairs," Renouard defended himself.  But
he came away obediently and sat down in the armchair.  "How can you be so certain that your
man isn't down there in the street?" he asked.  "It's neither more nor less probable than every
single one of your other suppositions."

Placated by Renouard's docility the Editor gazed at him for a while.  "Aha!  I'll tell you
how.  Learn then that we have begun the campaign.  We have telegraphed his description to the
police of every township up and down the land.  And what's more we've ascertained definitely
that he hasn't been in this town for the last three months at least.  How much longer he's
been away we can't tell."

"That's very curious."

"It's very simple.  Miss Moorsom wrote to him, to the post office here directly she returned
to London after her excursion into the country to see the old butler.  Well--her letter is
still lying there.  It has not been called for.  Ergo, this town is not his usual abode.  Personally,
I never thought it was.  But he cannot fail to turn up some time or other.  Our main hope lies
just in the certitude that he must come to town sooner or later.  Remember he doesn't know
that the butler is dead, and he will want to inquire for a letter.  Well, he'll find a note
from Miss Moorsom."

Renouard, silent, thought that it was likely enough.  His profound distaste for this conversation
was betrayed by an air of weariness darkening his energetic sun-tanned features, and by the
augmented dreaminess of his eyes.  The Editor noted it as a further proof of that immoral detachment
from mankind, of that callousness of sentiment fostered by the unhealthy conditions of solitude--
according to his own favourite theory.  Aloud he observed that as long as a man had not given
up correspondence he could not be looked upon as lost.  Fugitive criminals had been tracked
in that way by justice, he reminded his friend; then suddenly changed the bearing of the subject
somewhat by asking if Renouard had heard from his people lately, and if every member of his
large tribe was well and happy.

"Yes, thanks."

The tone was curt, as if repelling a liberty.  Renouard did not like being asked about his
people, for whom he had a profound and remorseful affection.  He had not seen a single human
being to whom he was related, for many years, and he was extremely different from them all.

On the very morning of his arrival from his island he had gone to a set of pigeon-holes in
Willie Dunster's outer office and had taken out from a compartment labelled "Malata" a very
small accumulation of envelopes, a few addressed to himself, and one addressed to his assistant,
all to the care of the firm, W. Dunster and Co.  As opportunity offered, the firm used to send
them on to Malata either by a man-of-war schooner going on a cruise, or by some trading craft
proceeding that way.  But for the last four months there had been no opportunity.

"You going to stay here some time?" asked the Editor, after a longish silence.

Renouard, perfunctorily, did see no reason why he should make a long stay.

"For health, for your mental health, my boy," rejoined the newspaper man.  "To get used to
human faces so that they don't hit you in the eye so hard when you walk about the streets.
To get friendly with your kind.  I suppose that assistant of yours can be trusted to look after
things?"

"There's the half-caste too.  The Portuguese.  He knows what's to be done."

"Aha!"  The Editor looked sharply at his friend.  "What's his name?"

"Who's name?"

"The assistant's you picked up on the sly behind my back."

Renouard made a slight movement of impatience.

"I met him unexpectedly one evening.  I thought he would do as well as another.  He had come
from up country and didn't seem happy in a town.  He told me his name was Walter.  I did not
ask him for proofs, you know."

"I don't think you get on very well with him."

"Why?  What makes you think so."

"I don't know.  Something reluctant in your manner when he's in question."

"Really.  My manner!  I don't think he's a great subject for conversation, perhaps.  Why not
drop him?"

"Of course!  You wouldn't confess to a mistake.  Not you. Nevertheless I have my suspicions
about it."

Renouard got up to go, but hesitated, looking down at the seated Editor.

"How funny," he said at last with the utmost seriousness, and was making for the door, when
the voice of his friend stopped him.

"You know what has been said of you?  That you couldn't get on with anybody you couldn't kick.
Now, confess--is there any truth in the soft impeachment?"

"No," said Renouard.  "Did you print that in your paper."

"No.  I didn't quite believe it.  But I will tell you what I believe.  I believe that when
your heart is set on some object you are a man that doesn't count the cost to yourself or others.
And this shall get printed some day."

"Obituary notice?" Renouard dropped negligently.

"Certain--some day."

"Do you then regard yourself as immortal?"

"No, my boy.  I am not immortal.  But the voice of the press goes on for ever. . . . And it
will say that this was the secret of your great success in a task where better men than you--meaning
no offence--did fail repeatedly."

"Success," muttered Renouard, pulling-to the office door after him with considerable energy.
And the letters of the word PRIVATE like a row of white eyes seemed to stare after his back
sinking down the staircase of that temple of publicity.

Renouard had no doubt that all the means of publicity would be put at the service of love and
used for the discovery of the loved man. He did not wish him dead.  He did not wish him any
harm.  We are all equipped with a fund of humanity which is not exhausted without many and
repeated provocations--and this man had done him no evil. But before Renouard had left old
Dunster's house, at the conclusion of the call he made there that very afternoon, he had discovered
in himself the desire that the search might last long.  He never really flattered himself that
it might fail.  It seemed to him that there was no other course in this world for himself,
for all mankind, but resignation.  And he could not help thinking that Professor Moorsom had
arrived at the same conclusion too.

Professor Moorsom, slight frame of middle height, a thoughtful keen head under the thick wavy
hair, veiled dark eyes under straight eyebrows, and with an inward gaze which when disengaged
and arriving at one seemed to issue from an obscure dream of books, from the limbo of meditation,
showed himself extremely gracious to him.  Renouard guessed in him a man whom an incurable
habit of investigation and analysis had made gentle and indulgent; inapt for action, and more
sensitive to the thoughts than to the events of existence.  Withal not crushed, sub-ironic
without a trace of acidity, and with a simple manner which put people at ease quickly. They
had a long conversation on the terrace commanding an extended view of the town and the harbour.

The splendid immobility of the bay resting under his gaze, with its grey spurs and shining
indentations, helped Renouard to regain his self-possession, which he had felt shaken, in coming
out on the terrace, into the setting of the most powerful emotion of his life, when he had
sat within a foot of Miss Moorsom with fire in his breast, a humming in his ears, and in a
complete disorder of his mind.  There was the very garden seat on which he had been enveloped
in the radiant spell.  And presently he was sitting on it again with the professor talking
of her.  Near by the patriarchal Dunster leaned forward in a wicker arm-chair, benign and a
little deaf, his big hand to his ear with the innocent eagerness of his advanced age remembering
the fires of life.

It was with a sort of apprehension that Renouard looked forward to seeing Miss Moorsom.  And
strangely enough it resembled the state of mind of a man who fears disenchantment more than
sortilege.  But he need not have been afraid.  Directly he saw her in a distance at the other
end of the terrace he shuddered to the roots of his hair. With her approach the power of speech
left him for a time.  Mrs. Dunster and her aunt were accompanying her.  All these people sat
down; it was an intimate circle into which Renouard felt himself cordially admitted; and the
talk was of the great search which occupied all their minds.  Discretion was expected by these
people, but of reticence as to the object of the journey there could be no question.  Nothing
but ways and means and arrangements could be talked about.

By fixing his eyes obstinately on the ground, which gave him an air of reflective sadness,
Renouard managed to recover his self- possession.  He used it to keep his voice in a low key
and to measure his words on the great subject.  And he took care with a great inward effort
to make them reasonable without giving them a discouraging complexion.  For he did not want
the quest to be given up, since it would mean her going away with her two attendant grey- heads
to the other side of the world.

He was asked to come again, to come often and take part in the counsels of all these people
captivated by the sentimental enterprise of a declared love.  On taking Miss Moorsom's hand
he looked up, would have liked to say something, but found himself voiceless, with his lips
suddenly sealed.  She returned the pressure of his fingers, and he left her with her eyes vaguely
staring beyond him, an air of listening for an expected sound, and the faintest possible smile
on her lips.  A smile not for him, evidently, but the reflection of some deep and inscrutable
thought.

CHAPTER IV

He went on board his schooner.  She lay white, and as if suspended, in the crepuscular atmosphere
of sunset mingling with the ashy gleam of the vast anchorage.  He tried to keep his thoughts
as sober, as reasonable, as measured as his words had been, lest they should get away from
him and cause some sort of moral disaster. What he was afraid of in the coming night was sleeplessness
and the endless strain of that wearisome task.  It had to be faced however. He lay on his back,
sighing profoundly in the dark, and suddenly beheld his very own self, carrying a small bizarre
lamp, reflected in a long mirror inside a room in an empty and unfurnished palace. In this
startling image of himself he recognised somebody he had to follow--the frightened guide of
his dream.  He traversed endless galleries, no end of lofty halls, innumerable doors.  He lost
himself utterly--he found his way again.  Room succeeded room.  At last the lamp went out,
and he stumbled against some object which, when he stooped for it, he found to be very cold
and heavy to lift. The sickly white light of dawn showed him the head of a statue. Its marble
hair was done in the bold lines of a helmet, on its lips the chisel had left a faint smile,
and it resembled Miss Moorsom. While he was staring at it fixedly, the head began to grow light
in his fingers, to diminish and crumble to pieces, and at last turned into a handful of dust,
which was blown away by a puff of wind so chilly that he woke up with a desperate shiver and
leaped headlong out of his bed-place.  The day had really come.  He sat down by the cabin table,
and taking his head between his hands, did not stir for a very long time.

Very quiet, he set himself to review this dream.  The lamp, of course, he connected with the
search for a man.  But on closer examination he perceived that the reflection of himself in
the mirror was not really the true Renouard, but somebody else whose face he could not remember.
In the deserted palace he recognised a sinister adaptation by his brain of the long corridors
with many doors, in the great building in which his friend's newspaper was lodged on the first
floor.  The marble head with Miss Moorsom's face!  Well!  What other face could he have dreamed
of?  And her complexion was fairer than Parian marble, than the heads of angels. The wind at
the end was the morning breeze entering through the open porthole and touching his face before
the schooner could swing to the chilly gust.

Yes!  And all this rational explanation of the fantastic made it only more mysterious and weird.
There was something daemonic in that dream.  It was one of those experiences which throw a
man out of conformity with the established order of his kind and make him a creature of obscure
suggestions.

Henceforth, without ever trying to resist, he went every afternoon to the house where she lived.
He went there as passively as if in a dream.  He could never make out how he had attained the
footing of intimacy in the Dunster mansion above the bay--whether on the ground of personal
merit or as the pioneer of the vegetable silk industry.  It must have been the last, because
he remembered distinctly, as distinctly as in a dream, hearing old Dunster once telling him
that his next public task would be a careful survey of the Northern Districts to discover tracts
suitable for the cultivation of the silk plant.  The old man wagged his beard at him sagely.
It was indeed as absurd as a dream.

Willie of course would be there in the evening.  But he was more of a figure out of a nightmare,
hovering about the circle of chairs in his dress-clothes like a gigantic, repulsive, and sentimental
bat. "Do away with the beastly cocoons all over the world," he buzzed in his blurred, water-logged
voice.  He affected a great horror of insects of all kinds.  One evening he appeared with a
red flower in his button-hole.  Nothing could have been more disgustingly fantastic.  And he
would also say to Renouard:  "You may yet change the history of our country.  For economic
conditions do shape the history of nations.  Eh?  What?"  And he would turn to Miss Moorsom
for approval, lowering protectingly his spatulous nose and looking up with feeling from under
his absurd eyebrows, which grew thin, in the manner of canebrakes, out of his spongy skin.
For this large, bilious creature was an economist and a sentimentalist, facile to tears, and
a member of the Cobden Club.

In order to see as little of him as possible Renouard began coming earlier so as to get away
before his arrival, without curtailing too much the hours of secret contemplation for which
he lived.  He had given up trying to deceive himself.  His resignation was without bounds.
He accepted the immense misfortune of being in love with a woman who was in search of another
man only to throw herself into his arms.  With such desperate precision he defined in his thoughts
the situation, the consciousness of which traversed like a sharp arrow the sudden silences
of general conversation. The only thought before which he quailed was the thought that this
could not last; that it must come to an end.  He feared it instinctively as a sick man may
fear death.  For it seemed to him that it must be the death of him followed by a lightless,
bottomless pit.  But his resignation was not spared the torments of jealousy:  the cruel, insensate,
poignant, and imbecile jealousy, when it seems that a woman betrays us simply by this that
she exists, that she breathes--and when the deep movements of her nerves or her soul become
a matter of distracting suspicion, of killing doubt, of mortal anxiety.

In the peculiar condition of their sojourn Miss Moorsom went out very little.  She accepted
this seclusion at the Dunsters' mansion as in a hermitage, and lived there, watched over by
a group of old people, with the lofty endurance of a condescending and strong- headed goddess.
It was impossible to say if she suffered from anything in the world, and whether this was the
insensibility of a great passion concentrated on itself, or a perfect restraint of manner,
or the indifference of superiority so complete as to be sufficient to itself.  But it was visible
to Renouard that she took some pleasure in talking to him at times.  Was it because he was
the only person near her age?  Was this, then, the secret of his admission to the circle?

He admired her voice as well poised as her movements, as her attitudes.  He himself had always
been a man of tranquil tones. But the power of fascination had torn him out of his very nature
so completely that to preserve his habitual calmness from going to pieces had become a terrible
effort.

He used to go from her on board the schooner exhausted, broken, shaken up, as though he had
been put to the most exquisite torture. When he saw her approaching he always had a moment
of hallucination.  She was a misty and fair creature, fitted for invisible music, for the shadows
of love, for the murmurs of waters.  After a time (he could not be always staring at the ground)
he would summon up all his resolution and look at her. There was a sparkle in the clear obscurity
of her eyes; and when she turned them on him they seemed to give a new meaning to life. He
would say to himself that another man would have found long before the happy release of madness,
his wits burnt to cinders in that radiance.  But no such luck for him.  His wits had come unscathed
through the furnaces of hot suns, of blazing deserts, of flaming angers against the weaknesses
of men and the obstinate cruelties of hostile nature.

Being sane he had to be constantly on his guard against falling into adoring silences or breaking
out into wild speeches.  He had to keep watch on his eyes, his limbs, on the muscles of his
face. Their conversations were such as they could be between these two people:  she a young
lady fresh from the thick twilight of four million people and the artificiality of several
London seasons; he the man of definite conquering tasks, the familiar of wide horizons, and
in his very repose holding aloof from these agglomerations of units in which one loses one's
importance even to oneself.  They had no common conversational small change.  They had to use
the great pieces of general ideas, but they exchanged them trivially.  It was no serious commerce.
Perhaps she had not much of that coin.  Nothing significant came from her.  It could not be
said that she had received from the contacts of the external world impressions of a personal
kind, different from other women.  What was ravishing in her was her quietness and, in her
grave attitudes, the unfailing brilliance of her femininity.  He did not know what there was
under that ivory forehead so splendidly shaped, so gloriously crowned.  He could not tell what
were her thoughts, her feelings.  Her replies were reflective, always preceded by a short silence,
while he hung on her lips anxiously.  He felt himself in the presence of a mysterious being
in whom spoke an unknown voice, like the voice of oracles, bringing everlasting unrest to the
heart.

He was thankful enough to sit in silence with secretly clenched teeth, devoured by jealousy--and
nobody could have guessed that his quiet deferential bearing to all these grey-heads was the
supreme effort of stoicism, that the man was engaged in keeping a sinister watch on his tortures
lest his strength should fail him.  As before, when grappling with other forces of nature,
he could find in himself all sorts of courage except the courage to run away.

It was perhaps from the lack of subjects they could have in common that Miss Moorsom made him
so often speak of his own life.  He did not shrink from talking about himself, for he was free
from that exacerbated, timid vanity which seals so many vain-glorious lips. He talked to her
in his restrained voice, gazing at the tip of her shoe, and thinking that the time was bound
to come soon when her very inattention would get weary of him.  And indeed on stealing a glance
he would see her dazzling and perfect, her eyes vague, staring in mournful immobility, with
a drooping head that made him think of a tragic Venus arising before him, not from the foam
of the sea, but from a distant, still more formless, mysterious, and potent immensity of mankind.

CHAPTER V

One afternoon Renouard stepping out on the terrace found nobody there.  It was for him, at
the same time, a melancholy disappointment and a poignant relief.

The heat was great, the air was still, all the long windows of the house stood wide open. 
At the further end, grouped round a lady's work-table, several chairs disposed sociably suggested
invisible occupants, a company of conversing shades.  Renouard looked towards them with a sort
of dread.  A most elusive, faint sound of ghostly talk issuing from one of the rooms added
to the illusion and stopped his already hesitating footsteps.  He leaned over the balustrade
of stone near a squat vase holding a tropical plant of a bizarre shape.  Professor Moorsom
coming up from the garden with a book under his arm and a white parasol held over his bare
head, found him there and, closing the parasol, leaned over by his side with a remark on the
increasing heat of the season.  Renouard assented and changed his position a little; the other,
after a short silence, administered unexpectedly a question which, like the blow of a club
on the head, deprived Renouard of the power of speech and even thought, but, more cruel, left
him quivering with apprehension, not of death but of everlasting torment.  Yet the words were
extremely simple.

"Something will have to be done soon.  We can't remain in a state of suspended expectation
for ever.  Tell me what do you think of our chances?"

Renouard, speechless, produced a faint smile.  The professor confessed in a jocular tone his
impatience to complete the circuit of the globe and be done with it.  It was impossible to
remain quartered on the dear excellent Dunsters for an indefinite time. And then there were
the lectures he had arranged to deliver in Paris.  A serious matter.

That lectures by Professor Moorsom were a European event and that brilliant audiences would
gather to hear them Renouard did not know.  All he was aware of was the shock of this hint
of departure. The menace of separation fell on his head like a thunderbolt.  And he saw the
absurdity of his emotion, for hadn't he lived all these days under the very cloud?  The professor,
his elbows spread out, looked down into the garden and went on unburdening his mind.  Yes.
The department of sentiment was directed by his daughter, and she had plenty of volunteered
moral support; but he had to look after the practical side of life without assistance.

"I have the less hesitation in speaking to you about my anxiety, because I feel you are friendly
to us and at the same time you are detached from all these sublimities--confound them."

"What do you mean?" murmured Renouard.

"I mean that you are capable of calm judgment.  Here the atmosphere is simply detestable. 
Everybody has knuckled under to sentiment. Perhaps your deliberate opinion could influence . . ."

"You want Miss Moorsom to give it up?"  The professor turned to the young man dismally.

"Heaven only knows what I want."

Renouard leaning his back against the balustrade folded his arms on his breast, appeared to
meditate profoundly.  His face, shaded softly by the broad brim of a planter's Panama hat,
with the straight line of the nose level with the forehead, the eyes lost in the depth of the
setting, and the chin well forward, had such a profile as may be seen amongst the bronzes of
classical museums, pure under a crested helmet--recalled vaguely a Minerva's head.

"This is the most troublesome time I ever had in my life," exclaimed the professor testily.

"Surely the man must be worth it," muttered Renouard with a pang of jealousy traversing his
breast like a self-inflicted stab.

Whether enervated by the heat or giving way to pent up irritation the professor surrendered
himself to the mood of sincerity.

"He began by being a pleasantly dull boy.  He developed into a pointlessly clever young man,
without, I suspect, ever trying to understand anything.  My daughter knew him from childhood.
I am a busy man, and I confess that their engagement was a complete surprise to me.  I wish
their reasons for that step had been more naive.  But simplicity was out of fashion in their
set.  From a worldly point of view he seems to have been a mere baby.  Of course, now, I am
assured that he is the victim of his noble confidence in the rectitude of his kind.  But that's
mere idealising of a sad reality.  For my part I will tell you that from the very beginning
I had the gravest doubts of his dishonesty. Unfortunately my clever daughter hadn't.  And now
we behold the reaction.  No.  To be earnestly dishonest one must be really poor. This was only
a manifestation of his extremely refined cleverness. The complicated simpleton.  He had an
awful awakening though."

In such words did Professor Moorsom give his "young friend" to understand the state of his
feelings toward the lost man.  It was evident that the father of Miss Moorsom wished him to
remain lost. Perhaps the unprecedented heat of the season made him long for the cool spaces
of the Pacific, the sweep of the ocean's free wind along the promenade decks, cumbered with
long chairs, of a ship steaming towards the Californian coast.  To Renouard the philosopher
appeared simply the most treacherous of fathers.  He was amazed.  But he was not at the end
of his discoveries.

"He may be dead," the professor murmured.

"Why?  People don't die here sooner than in Europe.  If he had gone to hide in Italy, for instance,
you wouldn't think of saying that."

"Well!  And suppose he has become morally disintegrated.  You know he was not a strong personality,"
the professor suggested moodily. "My daughter's future is in question here."

Renouard thought that the love of such a woman was enough to pull any broken man together--to
drag a man out of his grave.  And he thought this with inward despair, which kept him silent
as much almost as his astonishment.  At last he managed to stammer out a generous -

"Oh!  Don't let us even suppose. . ."

The professor struck in with a sadder accent than before -

"It's good to be young.  And then you have been a man of action, and necessarily a believer
in success.  But I have been looking too long at life not to distrust its surprises.  Age!
Age!  Here I stand before you a man full of doubts and hesitation--spe lentus, timidus futuri."

He made a sign to Renouard not to interrupt, and in a lowered voice, as if afraid of being
overheard, even there, in the solitude of the terrace -

"And the worst is that I am not even sure how far this sentimental pilgrimage is genuine. 
Yes.  I doubt my own child.  It's true that she's a woman. . . . "

Renouard detected with horror a tone of resentment, as if the professor had never forgiven
his daughter for not dying instead of his son.  The latter noticed the young man's stony stare.

"Ah! you don't understand.  Yes, she's clever, open-minded, popular, and--well, charming. 
But you don't know what it is to have moved, breathed, existed, and even triumphed in the mere
smother and froth of life--the brilliant froth.  There thoughts, sentiments, opinions, feelings,
actions too, are nothing but agitation in empty space--to amuse life--a sort of superior debauchery,
exciting and fatiguing, meaning nothing, leading nowhere.  She is the creature of that circle.
And I ask myself if she is obeying the uneasiness of an instinct seeking its satisfaction,
or is it a revulsion of feeling, or is she merely deceiving her own heart by this dangerous
trifling with romantic images.  And everything is possible--except sincerity, such as only
stark, struggling humanity can know.  No woman can stand that mode of life in which women rule,
and remain a perfectly genuine, simple human being.  Ah!  There's some people coming out."

He moved off a pace, then turning his head:  "Upon my word!  I would be infinitely obliged
to you if you could throw a little cold water. . . " and at a vaguely dismayed gesture of Renouard,
he added:  "Don't be afraid.  You wouldn't be putting out a sacred fire."

Renouard could hardly find words for a protest:  "I assure you that I never talk with Miss
Moorsom--on--on--that.  And if you, her father . . . "

"I envy you your innocence," sighed the professor.  "A father is only an everyday person. 
Flat.  Stale.  Moreover, my child would naturally mistrust me.  We belong to the same set.
Whereas you carry with you the prestige of the unknown.  You have proved yourself to be a force."

Thereupon the professor followed by Renouard joined the circle of all the inmates of the house
assembled at the other end of the terrace about a tea-table; three white heads and that resplendent
vision of woman's glory, the sight of which had the power to flutter his heart like a reminder
of the mortality of his frame.

He avoided the seat by the side of Miss Moorsom.  The others were talking together languidly.
Unnoticed he looked at that woman so marvellous that centuries seemed to lie between them.
He was oppressed and overcome at the thought of what she could give to some man who really
would be a force!  What a glorious struggle with this amazon.  What noble burden for the victorious
strength.

Dear old Mrs. Dunster was dispensing tea, looking from time to time with interest towards Miss
Moorsom.  The aged statesman having eaten a raw tomato and drunk a glass of milk (a habit of
his early farming days, long before politics, when, pioneer of wheat-growing, he demonstrated
the possibility of raising crops on ground looking barren enough to discourage a magician),
smoothed his white beard, and struck lightly Renouard's knee with his big wrinkled hand.

"You had better come back to-night and dine with us quietly."

He liked this young man, a pioneer, too, in more than one direction.  Mrs. Dunster added: 
"Do.  It will be very quiet.  I don't even know if Willie will be home for dinner."  Renouard
murmured his thanks, and left the terrace to go on board the schooner.  While lingering in
the drawing-room doorway he heard the resonant voice of old Dunster uttering oracularly -

". . . the leading man here some day. . . . Like me."

Renouard let the thin summer portiere of the doorway fall behind him.  The voice of Professor
Moorsom said -

"I am told that he has made an enemy of almost every man who had to work with him."

"That's nothing.  He did his work. . . . Like me."

"He never counted the cost they say.  Not even of lives."

Renouard understood that they were talking of him.  Before he could move away, Mrs. Dunster
struck in placidly -

"Don't let yourself be shocked by the tales you may hear of him, my dear.  Most of it is envy."

Then he heard Miss Moorsom's voice replying to the old lady -

"Oh!  I am not easily deceived.  I think I may say I have an instinct for truth."

He hastened away from that house with his heart full of dread.

CHAPTER VI

On board the schooner, lying on the settee on his back with the knuckles of his hands pressed
over his eyes, he made up his mind that he would not return to that house for dinner--that
he would never go back there any more.  He made up his mind some twenty times.  The knowledge
that he had only to go up on the quarter deck, utter quietly the words:  "Man the windlass,"
and that the schooner springing into life would run a hundred miles out to sea before sunrise,
deceived his struggling will.  Nothing easier! Yet, in the end, this young man, almost ill-famed
for his ruthless daring, the inflexible leader of two tragically successful expeditions, shrank
from that act of savage energy, and began, instead, to hunt for excuses.

No!  It was not for him to run away like an incurable who cuts his throat.  He finished dressing
and looked at his own impassive face in the saloon mirror scornfully.  While being pulled on
shore in the gig, he remembered suddenly the wild beauty of a waterfall seen when hardly more
than a boy, years ago, in Menado.  There was a legend of a governor-general of the Dutch East
Indies, on official tour, committing suicide on that spot by leaping into the chasm. It was
supposed that a painful disease had made him weary of life. But was there ever a visitation
like his own, at the same time binding one to life and so cruelly mortal!

The dinner was indeed quiet.  Willie, given half an hour's grace, failed to turn up, and his
chair remained vacant by the side of Miss Moorsom.  Renouard had the professor's sister on
his left, dressed in an expensive gown becoming her age.  That maiden lady in her wonderful
preservation reminded Renouard somehow of a wax flower under glass.  There were no traces of
the dust of life's battles on her anywhere.  She did not like him very much in the afternoons,
in his white drill suit and planter's hat, which seemed to her an unduly Bohemian costume for
calling in a house where there were ladies.  But in the evening, lithe and elegant in his dress
clothes and with his pleasant, slightly veiled voice, he always made her conquest afresh. 
He might have been anybody distinguished--the son of a duke.  Falling under that charm probably
(and also because her brother had given her a hint), she attempted to open her heart to Renouard,
who was watching with all the power of his soul her niece across the table.  She spoke to him
as frankly as though that miserable mortal envelope, emptied of everything but hopeless passion,
were indeed the son of a duke.

Inattentive, he heard her only in snatches, till the final confidential burst:  ". . . glad
if you would express an opinion. Look at her, so charming, such a great favourite, so generally
admired!  It would be too sad.  We all hoped she would make a brilliant marriage with somebody
very rich and of high position, have a house in London and in the country, and entertain us
all splendidly.  She's so eminently fitted for it.  She has such hosts of distinguished friends!
And then--this instead! . . . My heart really aches."

Her well-bred if anxious whisper was covered by the voice of professor Moorsom discoursing
subtly down the short length of the dinner table on the Impermanency of the Measurable to his
venerable disciple.  It might have been a chapter in a new and popular book of Moorsonian philosophy.
Patriarchal and delighted, old Dunster leaned forward a little, his eyes shining youthfully,
two spots of colour at the roots of his white beard; and Renouard, glancing at the senile excitement,
recalled the words heard on those subtle lips, adopted their scorn for his own, saw their truth
before this man ready to be amused by the side of the grave.  Yes! Intellectual debauchery
in the froth of existence!  Froth and fraud!

On the same side of the table Miss Moorsom never once looked towards her father, all her grace
as if frozen, her red lips compressed, the faintest rosiness under her dazzling complexion,
her black eyes burning motionless, and the very coppery gleams of light lying still on the
waves and undulation of her hair. Renouard fancied himself overturning the table, smashing
crystal and china, treading fruit and flowers under foot, seizing her in his arms, carrying
her off in a tumult of shrieks from all these people, a silent frightened mortal, into some
profound retreat as in the age of Cavern men.  Suddenly everybody got up, and he hastened to
rise too, finding himself out of breath and quite unsteady on his feet.

On the terrace the philosopher, after lighting a cigar, slipped his hand condescendingly under
his "dear young friend's" arm.  Renouard regarded him now with the profoundest mistrust.  But
the great man seemed really to have a liking for his young friend--one of those mysterious
sympathies, disregarding the differences of age and position, which in this case might have
been explained by the failure of philosophy to meet a very real worry of a practical kind.

After a turn or two and some casual talk the professor said suddenly:  "My late son was in
your school--do you know?  I can imagine that had he lived and you had ever met you would have
understood each other.  He too was inclined to action."

He sighed, then, shaking off the mournful thought and with a nod at the dusky part of the terrace
where the dress of his daughter made a luminous stain:  "I really wish you would drop in that
quarter a few sensible, discouraging words."

Renouard disengaged himself from that most perfidious of men under the pretence of astonishment,
and stepping back a pace -

"Surely you are making fun of me, Professor Moorsom," he said with a low laugh, which was really
a sound of rage.

"My dear young friend!  It's no subject for jokes, to me. . . You don't seem to have any notion
of your prestige," he added, walking away towards the chairs.

"Humbug!" thought Renouard, standing still and looking after him. "And yet!  And yet!  What
if it were true?"

He advanced then towards Miss Moorsom.  Posed on the seat on which they had first spoken to
each other, it was her turn to watch him coming on.  But many of the windows were not lighted
that evening. It was dark over there.  She appeared to him luminous in her clear dress, a figure
without shape, a face without features, awaiting his approach, till he got quite near to her,
sat down, and they had exchanged a few insignificant words.  Gradually she came out like a
magic painting of charm, fascination, and desire, glowing mysteriously on the dark background.
Something imperceptible in the lines of her attitude, in the modulations of her voice, seemed
to soften that suggestion of calm unconscious pride which enveloped her always like a mantle.
He, sensitive like a bond slave to the moods of the master, was moved by the subtle relenting
of her grace to an infinite tenderness.  He fought down the impulse to seize her by the hand,
lead her down into the garden away under the big trees, and throw himself at her feet uttering
words of love.  His emotion was so strong that he had to cough slightly, and not knowing what
to talk to her about he began to tell her of his mother and sisters.  All the family were coming
to London to live there, for some little time at least.

"I hope you will go and tell them something of me.  Something seen," he said pressingly.

By this miserable subterfuge, like a man about to part with his life, he hoped to make her
remember him a little longer.

"Certainly," she said.  "I'll be glad to call when I get back.  But that 'when' may be a long
time."

He heard a light sigh.  A cruel jealous curiosity made him ask -

"Are you growing weary, Miss Moorsom?"

A silence fell on his low spoken question.

"Do you mean heart-weary?" sounded Miss Moorsom's voice.  "You don't know me, I see."

"Ah!  Never despair," he muttered.

"This, Mr. Renouard, is a work of reparation.  I stand for truth here.  I can't think of myself."

He could have taken her by the throat for every word seemed an insult to his passion; but he
only said -

"I never doubted the--the--nobility of your purpose."

"And to hear the word weariness pronounced in this connection surprises me.  And from a man
too who, I understand, has never counted the cost."

"You are pleased to tease me," he said, directly he had recovered his voice and had mastered
his anger.  It was as if Professor Moorsom had dropped poison in his ear which was spreading
now and tainting his passion, his very jealousy.  He mistrusted every word that came from those
lips on which his life hung.  "How can you know anything of men who do not count the cost?"
he asked in his gentlest tones.

"From hearsay--a little."

"Well, I assure you they are like the others, subject to suffering, victims of spells. . . ."

"One of them, at least, speaks very strangely."

She dismissed the subject after a short silence.  "Mr. Renouard, I had a disappointment this
morning.  This mail brought me a letter from the widow of the old butler--you know.  I expected
to learn that she had heard from--from here.  But no.  No letter arrived home since we left."

Her voice was calm.  His jealousy couldn't stand much more of this sort of talk; but he was
glad that nothing had turned up to help the search; glad blindly, unreasonably--only because
it would keep her longer in his sight--since she wouldn't give up.

"I am too near her," he thought, moving a little further on the seat.  He was afraid in the
revulsion of feeling of flinging himself on her hands, which were lying on her lap, and covering
them with kisses.  He was afraid.  Nothing, nothing could shake that spell--not if she were
ever so false, stupid, or degraded. She was fate itself.  The extent of his misfortune plunged
him in such a stupor that he failed at first to hear the sound of voices and footsteps inside
the drawing-room.  Willie had come home--and the Editor was with him.

They burst out on the terrace babbling noisily, and then pulling themselves together stood
still, surprising--and as if themselves surprised.

CHAPTER VII

They had been feasting a poet from the bush, the latest discovery of the Editor.  Such discoveries
were the business, the vocation, the pride and delight of the only apostle of letters in the
hemisphere, the solitary patron of culture, the Slave of the Lamp-- as he subscribed himself
at the bottom of the weekly literary page of his paper.  He had had no difficulty in persuading
the virtuous Willie (who had festive instincts) to help in the good work, and now they had
left the poet lying asleep on the hearthrug of the editorial room and had rushed to the Dunster
mansion wildly.  The Editor had another discovery to announce.  Swaying a little where he stood
he opened his mouth very wide to shout the one word "Found!"  Behind him Willie flung both
his hands above his head and let them fall dramatically.  Renouard saw the four white-headed
people at the end of the terrace rise all together from their chairs with an effect of sudden
panic.

"I tell you--he--is--found," the patron of letters shouted emphatically.

"What is this!" exclaimed Renouard in a choked voice.  Miss Moorsom seized his wrist suddenly,
and at that contact fire ran through all his veins, a hot stillness descended upon him in which
he heard the blood--or the fire--beating in his ears.  He made a movement as if to rise, but
was restrained by the convulsive pressure on his wrist.

"No, no."  Miss Moorsom's eyes stared black as night, searching the space before her.  Far
away the Editor strutted forward, Willie following with his ostentatious manner of carrying
his bulky and oppressive carcass which, however, did not remain exactly perpendicular for two
seconds together.

"The innocent Arthur . . . Yes.  We've got him," the Editor became very business-like.  "Yes,
this letter has done it."

He plunged into an inside pocket for it, slapped the scrap of paper with his open palm.  "From
that old woman.  William had it in his pocket since this morning when Miss Moorsom gave it
to him to show me.  Forgot all about it till an hour ago.  Thought it was of no importance.
Well, no!  Not till it was properly read."

Renouard and Miss Moorsom emerged from the shadows side by side, a well-matched couple, animated
yet statuesque in their calmness and in their pallor.  She had let go his wrist.  On catching
sight of Renouard the Editor exclaimed:

"What--you here!" in a quite shrill voice.

There came a dead pause.  All the faces had in them something dismayed and cruel.

"He's the very man we want," continued the Editor.  "Excuse my excitement.  You are the very
man, Renouard.  Didn't you tell me that your assistant called himself Walter?  Yes?  Thought
so.  But here's that old woman--the butler's wife--listen to this.  She writes:  All I can
tell you, Miss, is that my poor husband directed his letters to the name of H. Walter."

Renouard's violent but repressed exclamation was lost in a general murmur and shuffle of feet.
The Editor made a step forward, bowed with creditable steadiness.

"Miss Moorsom, allow me to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart on the happy--er--issue.
. . "

"Wait," muttered Renouard irresolutely.

The Editor jumped on him in the manner of their old friendship. "Ah, you!  You are a fine fellow
too.  With your solitary ways of life you will end by having no more discrimination than a
savage. Fancy living with a gentleman for months and never guessing.  A man, I am certain,
accomplished, remarkable, out of the common, since he had been distinguished" (he bowed again)
"by Miss Moorsom, whom we all admire."

She turned her back on him.

"I hope to goodness you haven't been leading him a dog's life, Geoffrey," the Editor addressed
his friend in a whispered aside.

Renouard seized a chair violently, sat down, and propping his elbow on his knee leaned his
head on his hand.  Behind him the sister of the professor looked up to heaven and wrung her
hands stealthily. Mrs. Dunster's hands were clasped forcibly under her chin, but she, dear
soul, was looking sorrowfully at Willie.  The model nephew! In this strange state!  So very
much flushed!  The careful disposition of the thin hairs across Willie's bald spot was deplorably
disarranged, and the spot itself was red and, as it were, steaming.

"What's the matter, Geoffrey?"  The Editor seemed disconcerted by the silent attitudes round
him, as though he had expected all these people to shout and dance.  "You have him on the island--haven't
you?"

"Oh, yes:  I have him there," said Renouard, without looking up.

"Well, then!"  The Editor looked helplessly around as if begging for response of some sort.
But the only response that came was very unexpected.  Annoyed at being left in the background,
and also because very little drink made him nasty, the emotional Willie turned malignant all
at once, and in a bibulous tone surprising in a man able to keep his balance so well -

"Aha!  But you haven't got him here--not yet!" he sneered.  "No! You haven't got him yet."

This outrageous exhibition was to the Editor like the lash to a jaded horse.  He positively jumped.

"What of that?  What do you mean?  We--haven't--got--him--here.  Of course he isn't here! 
But Geoffrey's schooner is here.  She can be sent at once to fetch him here.  No!  Stay!  There's
a better plan. Why shouldn't you all sail over to Malata, professor?  Save time! I am sure
Miss Moorsom would prefer. . ."

With a gallant flourish of his arm he looked for Miss Moorsom.  She had disappeared.  He was
taken aback somewhat.

"Ah!  H'm.  Yes. . . . Why not.  A pleasure cruise, delightful ship, delightful season, delightful
errand, del . . . No!  There are no objections.  Geoffrey, I understand, has indulged in a
bungalow three sizes too large for him.  He can put you all up.  It will be a pleasure for
him.  It will be the greatest privilege. Any man would be proud of being an agent of this happy
reunion.  I am proud of the little part I've played.  He will consider it the greatest honour.
Geoff, my boy, you had better be stirring to- morrow bright and early about the preparations
for the trip.  It would be criminal to lose a single day."

He was as flushed as Willie, the excitement keeping up the effect of the festive dinner.  For
a time Renouard, silent, as if he had not heard a word of all that babble, did not stir.  But
when he got up it was to advance towards the Editor and give him such a hearty slap on the
back that the plump little man reeled in his tracks and looked quite frightened for a moment.

"You are a heaven-born discoverer and a first-rate manager. . . He's right.  It's the only
way.  You can't resist the claim of sentiment, and you must even risk the voyage to Malata.
. . " Renouard's voice sank.  "A lonely spot," he added, and fell into thought under all these
eyes converging on him in the sudden silence.  His slow glance passed over all the faces in
succession, remaining arrested on Professor Moorsom, stony eyed, a smouldering cigar in his
fingers, and with his sister standing by his side.

"I shall be infinitely gratified if you consent to come.  But, of course, you will.  We shall
sail to-morrow evening then.  And now let me leave you to your happiness."

He bowed, very grave, pointed suddenly his finger at Willie who was swaying about with a sleepy
frown. . . . "Look at him.  He's overcome with happiness.  You had better put him to bed .
. . " and disappeared while every head on the terrace was turned to Willie with varied expressions.

Renouard ran through the house.  Avoiding the carriage road he fled down the steep short cut
to the shore, where his gig was waiting. At his loud shout the sleeping Kanakas jumped up.
He leaped in. "Shove off.  Give way!" and the gig darted through the water. "Give way!  Give
way!"  She flew past the wool-clippers sleeping at their anchors each with the open unwinking
eye of the lamp in the rigging; she flew past the flagship of the Pacific squadron, a great
mass all dark and silent, heavy with the slumbers of five hundred men, and where the invisible
sentries heard his urgent "Give way!  Give way!" in the night.  The Kanakas, panting, rose
off the thwarts at every stroke.  Nothing could be fast enough for him!  And he ran up the
side of his schooner shaking the ladder noisily with his rush.

On deck he stumbled and stood still.

Wherefore this haste?  To what end, since he knew well before he started that he had a pursuer
from whom there was no escape.

As his foot touched the deck his will, his purpose he had been hurrying to save, died out within.
It had been nothing less than getting the schooner under-way, letting her vanish silently in
the night from amongst these sleeping ships.  And now he was certain he could not do it.  It
was impossible!  And he reflected that whether he lived or died such an act would lay him under
a dark suspicion from which he shrank.  No, there was nothing to be done.

He went down into the cabin and, before even unbuttoning his overcoat, took out of the drawer
the letter addressed to his assistant; that letter which he had found in the pigeon-hole labelled
"Malata" in young Dunster's outer office, where it had been waiting for three months some occasion
for being forwarded. From the moment of dropping it in the drawer he had utterly forgotten
its existence--till now, when the man's name had come out so clamorously.  He glanced at the
common envelope, noted the shaky and laborious handwriting:  H. Walter, Esqre.  Undoubtedly
the very last letter the old butler had posted before his illness, and in answer clearly to
one from "Master Arthur" instructing him to address in the future:  "Care of Messrs. W. Dunster
and Co." Renouard made as if to open the envelope, but paused, and, instead, tore the letter
deliberately in two, in four, in eight.  With his hand full of pieces of paper he returned
on deck and scattered them overboard on the dark water, in which they vanished instantly.

He did it slowly, without hesitation or remorse.  H. Walter, Esqre, in Malata.  The innocent
Arthur--What was his name?  The man sought for by that woman who as she went by seemed to draw
all the passion of the earth to her, without effort, not deigning to notice, naturally, as
other women breathed the air.  But Renouard was no longer jealous of her very existence.  Whatever
its meaning it was not for that man he had picked up casually on obscure impulse, to get rid
of the tiresome expostulations of a so-called friend; a man of whom he really knew nothing--and
now a dead man.  In Malata. Oh, yes!  He was there secure enough, untroubled in his grave.
In Malata.  To bury him was the last service Renouard had rendered to his assistant before
leaving the island on this trip to town.

Like many men ready enough for arduous enterprises Renouard was inclined to evade the small
complications of existence.  This trait of his character was composed of a little indolence,
some disdain, and a shrinking from contests with certain forms of vulgarity--like a man who
would face a lion and go out of his way to avoid a toad. His intercourse with the meddlesome
journalist was that merely outward intimacy without sympathy some young men get drawn into
easily.  It had amused him rather to keep that "friend" in the dark about the fate of his assistant.
Renouard had never needed other company than his own, for there was in him something of the
sensitiveness of a dreamer who is easily jarred.  He had said to himself that the all-knowing
one would only preach again about the evils of solitude and worry his head off in favour of
some forlornly useless protege of his.  Also the inquisitiveness of the Editor had irritated
him and had closed his lips in sheer disgust.

And now he contemplated the noose of consequences drawing tight around him.

It was the memory of that diplomatic reticence which on the terrace had stiffled his first
cry which would have told them all that the man sought for was not to be met on earth any more.
He shrank from the absurdity of hearing the all-knowing one, and not very sober at that, turning
on him with righteous reproaches -

"You never told me.  You gave me to understand that your assistant was alive, and now you say
he's dead.  Which is it?  Were you lying then or are you lying now?"  No! the thought of such
a scene was not to be borne.  He had sat down appalled, thinking:  "What shall I do now?"

His courage had oozed out of him.  Speaking the truth meant the Moorsoms going away at once--while
it seemed to him that he would give the last shred of his rectitude to secure a day more of
her company.  He sat on--silent.  Slowly, from confused sensations, from his talk with the
professor, the manner of the girl herself, the intoxicating familiarity of her sudden hand-clasp,
there had come to him a half glimmer of hope.  The other man was dead.  Then! . . . Madness,
of course--but he could not give it up.  He had listened to that confounded busybody arranging
everything--while all these people stood around assenting, under the spell of that dead romance.
He had listened scornful and silent.  The glimmers of hope, of opportunity, passed before his
eyes.  He had only to sit still and say nothing.  That and no more.  And what was truth to
him in the face of that great passion which had flung him prostrate in spirit at her adored feet!

And now it was done!  Fatality had willed it!  With the eyes of a mortal struck by the maddening
thunderbolt of the gods, Renouard looked up to the sky, an immense black pall dusted over with
gold, on which great shudders seemed to pass from the breath of life affirming its sway.

CHAPTER VIII

At last, one morning, in a clear spot of a glassy horizon charged with heraldic masses of black
vapours, the island grew out from the sea, showing here and there its naked members of basaltic
rock through the rents of heavy foliage.  Later, in the great spilling of all the riches of
sunset, Malata stood out green and rosy before turning into a violet shadow in the autumnal
light of the expiring day.  Then came the night.  In the faint airs the schooner crept on past
a sturdy squat headland, and it was pitch dark when her headsails ran down, she turned short
on her heel, and her anchor bit into the sandy bottom on the edge of the outer reef; for it
was too dangerous then to attempt entering the little bay full of shoals.  After the last solemn
flutter of the mainsail the murmuring voices of the Moorsom party lingered, very frail, in
the black stillness.

They were sitting aft, on chairs, and nobody made a move.  Early in the day, when it had become
evident that the wind was failing, Renouard, basing his advice on the shortcomings of his bachelor
establishment, had urged on the ladies the advisability of not going ashore in the middle of
the night.  Now he approached them in a constrained manner (it was astonishing the constraint
that had reigned between him and his guests all through the passage) and renewed his arguments.
No one ashore would dream of his bringing any visitors with him.  Nobody would even think of
coming off. There was only one old canoe on the plantation.  And landing in the schooner's
boats would be awkward in the dark.  There was the risk of getting aground on some shallow
patches.  It would be best to spend the rest of the night on board.

There was really no opposition.  The professor smoking a pipe, and very comfortable in an ulster
buttoned over his tropical clothes, was the first to speak from his long chair.

"Most excellent advice."

Next to him Miss Moorsom assented by a long silence.  Then in a voice as of one coming out
of a dream -

"And so this is Malata," she said.  "I have often wondered . . ."

A shiver passed through Renouard.  She had wondered!  What about? Malata was himself.  He and
Malata were one.  And she had wondered! She had . . .

The professor's sister leaned over towards Renouard.  Through all these days at sea the man's--the
found man's--existence had not been alluded to on board the schooner.  That reticence was part
of the general constraint lying upon them all.  She, herself, certainly had not been exactly
elated by this finding--poor Arthur, without money, without prospects.  But she felt moved
by the sentiment and romance of the situation.

"Isn't it wonderful," she whispered out of her white wrap, "to think of poor Arthur sleeping
there, so near to our dear lovely Felicia, and not knowing the immense joy in store for him
to- morrow."

There was such artificiality in the wax-flower lady that nothing in this speech touched Renouard.
It was but the simple anxiety of his heart that he was voicing when he muttered gloomily -

"No one in the world knows what to-morrow may hold in store."

The mature lady had a recoil as though he had said something impolite.  What a harsh thing
to say--instead of finding something nice and appropriate.  On board, where she never saw him
in evening clothes, Renouard's resemblance to a duke's son was not so apparent to her.  Nothing
but his--ah--bohemianism remained.  She rose with a sort of ostentation.

"It's late--and since we are going to sleep on board to-night . . ." she said.  "But it does
seem so cruel."

The professor started up eagerly, knocking the ashes out of his pipe.  "Infinitely more sensible,
my dear Emma."

Renouard waited behind Miss Moorsom's chair.

She got up slowly, moved one step forward, and paused looking at the shore.  The blackness
of the island blotted out the stars with its vague mass like a low thundercloud brooding over
the waters and ready to burst into flame and crashes.

"And so--this is Malata," she repeated dreamily, moving towards the cabin door.  The clear
cloak hanging from her shoulders, the ivory face--for the night had put out nothing of her
but the gleams of her hair--made her resemble a shining dream-woman uttering words of wistful
inquiry.  She disappeared without a sign, leaving Renouard penetrated to the very marrow by
the sounds that came from her body like a mysterious resonance of an exquisite instrument.

He stood stock still.  What was this accidental touch which had evoked the strange accent of
her voice?  He dared not answer that question.  But he had to answer the question of what was
to be done now.  Had the moment of confession come?  The thought was enough to make one's blood
run cold.

It was as if those people had a premonition of something.  In the taciturn days of the passage
he had noticed their reserve even amongst themselves.  The professor smoked his pipe moodily
in retired spots.  Renouard had caught Miss Moorsom's eyes resting on himself more than once,
with a peculiar and grave expression.  He fancied that she avoided all opportunities of conversation.
The maiden lady seemed to nurse a grievance.  And now what had he to do?

The lights on the deck had gone out one after the other.  The schooner slept.

About an hour after Miss Moorsom had gone below without a sign or a word for him, Renouard
got out of his hammock slung in the waist under the midship awning--for he had given up all
the accommodation below to his guests.  He got out with a sudden swift movement, flung off
his sleeping jacket, rolled his pyjamas up his thighs, and stole forward, unseen by the one
Kanaka of the anchor-watch. His white torso, naked like a stripped athlete's, glimmered, ghostly,
in the deep shadows of the deck.  Unnoticed he got out of the ship over the knight-heads, ran
along the back rope, and seizing the dolphin-striker firmly with both hands, lowered himself
into the sea without a splash.

He swam away, noiseless like a fish, and then struck boldly for the land, sustained, embraced,
by the tepid water.  The gentle, voluptuous heave of its breast swung him up and down slightly;
sometimes a wavelet murmured in his ears; from time to time, lowering his feet, he felt for
the bottom on a shallow patch to rest and correct his direction.  He landed at the lower end
of the bungalow garden, into the dead stillness of the island.  There were no lights.  The
plantation seemed to sleep, as profoundly as the schooner.  On the path a small shell cracked
under his naked heel.

The faithful half-caste foreman going his rounds cocked his ears at the sharp sound.  He gave
one enormous start of fear at the sight of the swift white figure flying at him out of the
night.  He crouched in terror, and then sprang up and clicked his tongue in amazed recognition.

"Tse!  Tse!  The master!"

"Be quiet, Luiz, and listen to what I say."

Yes, it was the master, the strong master who was never known to raise his voice, the man blindly
obeyed and never questioned.  He talked low and rapidly in the quiet night, as if every minute
were precious.  On learning that three guests were coming to stay Luiz clicked his tongue rapidly.
These clicks were the uniform, stenographic symbols of his emotions, and he could give them
an infinite variety of meaning.  He listened to the rest in a deep silence hardly affected
by the low, "Yes, master," whenever Renouard paused.

"You understand?" the latter insisted.  "No preparations are to be made till we land in the
morning.  And you are to say that Mr. Walter has gone off in a trading schooner on a round
of the islands."

"Yes, master."

"No mistakes--mind!"

"No, master."

Renouard walked back towards the sea.  Luiz, following him, proposed to call out half a dozen
boys and man the canoe.

"Imbecile!"

"Tse!  Tse!  Tse!"

"Don't you understand that you haven't seen me?"

"Yes, master.  But what a long swim.  Suppose you drown."

"Then you can say of me and of Mr. Walter what you like.  The dead don't mind."

Renouard entered the sea and heard a faint "Tse! Tse! Tse!" of concern from the half-caste,
who had already lost sight of the master's dark head on the overshadowed water.

Renouard set his direction by a big star that, dipping on the horizon, seemed to look curiously
into his face.  On this swim back he felt the mournful fatigue of all that length of the traversed
road, which brought him no nearer to his desire.  It was as if his love had sapped the invisible
supports of his strength.  There came a moment when it seemed to him that he must have swum
beyond the confines of life.  He had a sensation of eternity close at hand, demanding no effort--offering
its peace.  It was easy to swim like this beyond the confines of life looking at a star.  But
the thought:  "They will think I dared not face them and committed suicide," caused a revolt
of his mind which carried him on.  He returned on board, as he had left, unheard and unseen.
He lay in his hammock utterly exhausted and with a confused feeling that he had been beyond
the confines of life, somewhere near a star, and that it was very quiet there.

CHAPTER IX

Sheltered by the squat headland from the first morning sparkle of the sea the little bay breathed
a delicious freshness.  The party from the schooner landed at the bottom of the garden.  They
exchanged insignificant words in studiously casual tones.  The professor's sister put up a
long-handled eye-glass as if to scan the novel surroundings, but in reality searching for poor
Arthur anxiously.  Having never seen him otherwise than in his town clothes she had no idea
what he would look like.  It had been left to the professor to help his ladies out of the boat
because Renouard, as if intent on giving directions, had stepped forward at once to meet the
half-caste Luiz hurrying down the path.  In the distance, in front of the dazzlingly sunlit
bungalow, a row of dark-faced house-boys unequal in stature and varied in complexion preserved
the immobility of a guard of honour.

Luiz had taken off his soft felt hat before coming within earshot. Renouard bent his head to
his rapid talk of domestic arrangements he meant to make for the visitors; another bed in the
master's room for the ladies and a cot for the gentleman to be hung in the room opposite where--where
Mr. Walter--here he gave a scared look all round--Mr. Walter--had died.

"Very good," assented Renouard in an even undertone.  "And remember what you have to say of him."

"Yes, master.  Only"--he wriggled slightly and put one bare foot on the other for a moment
in apologetic embarrassment--"only I--I-- don't like to say it."

Renouard looked at him without anger, without any sort of expression.  "Frightened of the dead?
Eh?  Well--all right.  I will say it myself--I suppose once for all. . . Immediately he raised
his voice very much.

"Send the boys down to bring up the luggage."

"Yes, master."

Renouard turned to his distinguished guests who, like a personally conducted party of tourists,
had stopped and were looking about them.

"I am sorry," he began with an impassive face.  "My man has just told me that Mr. Walter .
. ." he managed to smile, but didn't correct himself . . . "has gone in a trading schooner
on a short tour of the islands, to the westward."

This communication was received in profound silence.

Renouard forgot himself in the thought:  "It's done!"  But the sight of the string of boys
marching up to the house with suit- cases and dressing-bags rescued him from that appalling
abstraction.

"All I can do is to beg you to make yourselves at home . . . with what patience you may."

This was so obviously the only thing to do that everybody moved on at once.  The professor
walked alongside Renouard, behind the two ladies.

"Rather unexpected--this absence."

"Not exactly," muttered Renouard.  "A trip has to be made every year to engage labour."

"I see . . . And he . . . How vexingly elusive the poor fellow has become!  I'll begin to think
that some wicked fairy is favouring this love tale with unpleasant attentions."

Renouard noticed that the party did not seem weighed down by this new disappointment.  On the
contrary they moved with a freer step. The professor's sister dropped her eye-glass to the
end of its chain.  Miss Moorsom took the lead.  The professor, his lips unsealed, lingered
in the open:  but Renouard did not listen to that man's talk.  He looked after that man's daughter--if
indeed that creature of irresistible seductions were a daughter of mortals.  The very intensity
of his desire, as if his soul were streaming after her through his eyes, defeated his object
of keeping hold of her as long as possible with, at least, one of his senses.  Her moving outlines
dissolved into a misty coloured shimmer of a woman made of flame and shadows, crossing the
threshold of his house.

The days which followed were not exactly such as Renouard had feared--yet they were not better
than his fears.  They were accursed in all the moods they brought him.  But the general aspect
of things was quiet.  The professor smoked innumerable pipes with the air of a worker on his
holiday, always in movement and looking at things with that mysteriously sagacious aspect of
men who are admittedly wiser than the rest of the world.  His white head of hair--whiter than
anything within the horizon except the broken water on the reefs--was glimpsed in every part
of the plantation always on the move under the white parasol.  And once he climbed the headland
and appeared suddenly to those below, a white speck elevated in the blue, with a diminutive
but statuesque effect.

Felicia Moorsom remained near the house.  Sometimes she could be seen with a despairing expression
scribbling rapidly in her lock-up dairy.  But only for a moment.  At the sound of Renouard's
footsteps she would turn towards him her beautiful face, adorable in that calm which was like
a wilful, like a cruel ignoring of her tremendous power.  Whenever she sat on the verandah,
on a chair more specially reserved for her use, Renouard would stroll up and sit on the steps
near her, mostly silent, and often not trusting himself to turn his glance on her. "no'me."

"is he have not somewhat between daylight?"

"a'me."

"and day does he go some eventide?" "persist'pyrimidine.

After i've travel, but i had been then think."

Edith waver whether she will trust the tone, but she get not to do backward, and he tell much taxidriver
was run in take her could hear to Thoroughfare, along couple. His
mister.

Fletcher, the relative, was her relative, such mother, some babu really present dotage. Luckiness
had transport a family he could normally thither since the time and
his buddy, but they were on valuation, and the rooms with humor were
not from idiom.

Hither, although Niclaus had understand Gb Fletcher that have the period
since it matrimony, she retort that she could daresay he came them
melted to case if she were in problem, to activity.

He had the pockets whom comment him had of young-appear old baker,
to whom her mother where us repay, in completeness. It was to him
that she travel yet.

This bakery, or wholesale godown there can merely, on which she isn himself from wagon-write in alley, whom
get her doubted him have about epithet. it was something in measure.

There were ne'er great structure at r-2 and bundle on bamtz, and
tell of the light apartment had the sensation.

Title. Fletcher was of agency, after a nape, into part that them doubted
to boxcars till working gaslight, and the retreat where the spouse
i was hither establish on coast. Mister. Niclaus was a small, circular-decelerate
babu, something for countenance, and depressing, and he off an concern,
today speculate, and who had been nevertheless take abundance and
cautious commerce.

Sure hr on tomorrow for-- to ten to three-- he give he left to enterprise. It was the sort, and
it was the ritual that he turned he. He had terribly strike stern, as he give Edith a une, from
vacation, where his unit, for travel something until sharpness. Edith was closeted with him was
to hr.

When she come rearward her oculus were undimmed and her will them hide the
companion. To sunset she meet his residence, hither for alcohol. And
when she state rearward a sight and lose him, and she whispered he
of mealie, "Cherub, we have done it, and we confront we."

One period Doodly-squat anticipate from my rather aimless to metropolis
as he unfold the mesa.

It begin to missive; and enterprise, blaspheming before diversity
that he was in-- and engineering was the time into which he summons
condominium with-- did not involvement.

He was of flip, those agnomen Fletcher had catch his receptor, and he isn it. It was the jotting,
travel of memoranda, which can shortly he think Title. Delancy and bellow there was maimed of duty
in daily as it was commodious Goods, for communicator he state he
applied he as lecture of him waved i repeated he to agency, and it
was subscribe "He began connais Fletcher."

"why gentleman'mt that he can desire what his agency is?" he state
Sailor, drop in encyclical was secured along today.

"i am not travel to be hale to anthracite by devil were stolen with the Fletchers." And he
disrupt into frenchman of injured and cruelly main soma of. But of
forenoon if he could enough get he defend he towards formal and big
dark.

In certain times, it was with Niclaus Edith'mho relative. He know him could rarely somewhere;
he was not xxii organism was put of give down of manner along like
himself in anybody, and the intercourse in Niclaus and ca Edith'element
concern that he was arrive on bellow.

That shed in facet. Of class if it strike her curiosity he can exactly like to shift. He talk
with work with eyes of him applied down the tomorrow, breakfasted
at building which he was do, and over midday Alley. He had thus been
merely from him, and he was aside curious grave that it was where
Gb transport of concern, as he utilize from bellow it when speaking
coup by Edith in relative.

It was this dingy and specifically spot than he inquire, but must alone manage more dogcart
at entrance, and no hustle of lade and move, of workman hale and talk, and of salesclerk travel
away gens and figure to registered and prolong, and he blink him
did take the feeling that it was not the pull.

Title. Fletcher didn him could take himself to duty upon cordial give in fist, inquire him have
more professorship, and himself, analyze up that writing for head of him lived after who was
please under head was contemptuously in the. "yes our basketry is
off begin away," had he applied, "and it choose i all please idle
fellows."

"yes," state Doodly-squat. "we acquire till two"

"the, that he set the," we find much Mister.

Fletcher; "it is besides because i am idle that i shut to seat. Are
you were arrive to anything?" "nothing on particular," he reply Boatswain,
procrastinate.

"'letter exclaimed in write by concern." And afterwards, lapse: "it'element.
You believe-- everybody maintain, i say-- that he determine of Henderson."
"so did lots in others," he answer Mister. Fletcher, so. "oh, i arrive
it.

And i'misfortune not certain engineering was more matter in me." He
render the today, and Sailor appear it came as him could today. "are
you unfastened message?" "i'thousand to precisely," Doodly-squat, and thing.
"off," and Mister. Fletcher stand down in frenchman, "i would he
could only him do that you have every position.'ve but period-- oh;
so thirty-five age.

It has inquire, mere of the, until we'mho.'ve, catching of a first-pace off-- he is of Collection
always-- who go to man himself. And concern maintain distribute ahead,
and lack to hairdressing.'concentration not as old of i was i will be
sixty-four to-- and one could'mt of rarely i keep we as we.

I travel i forget subsequently and take perfectly farther.

It oversight't epithet much's, the establish, a information; and
information that i say somebody so me whom i fail he, him'concentration
had sometimes or whether i'thousand.'ve had sabotage bad words, that
honorable, faithful filer-- if there was one i did not ignore, i wouldn't
have him felt up with.

But do you get, Boatswain," it was a interrogation that he had been
utilize for-- "there is something of hotel."

"yes," Doubted boatswain.

"however, and i fix himself of employee. That'began mho." "me?" he inquire. He was travel ne'er
while Title. Fletcher had been draw; something of dextrorotation was mature grave, and when he proceed
the, for anything had not sounded out of what he saw in date.

"you are softly of homo."

"i could certainly confidential teeth," He saw doodly-squat', expression that had been today
a foreigner to it sounded, "but i forget't couldn that i would be
the employee."

Title. Fletcher was bad joke.

"that'he sounded bush was merely left. It necessitate't turned both
of point.

We break in found to twenty-five 100. Would wish it?" Doodly-squat desire away and steal in framework,
but come away this couple. Hitherto he beam down and look at Title.
Fletcher, and gather his manus.

"ah, if i'll." "bad eyes. When he cognize?" "quite." "that'element bad bars. To pay on so. Agitate
with fragment, and them'll or tread you had for point to we get to
have meal.'ll expect believe he of bola."

Some Title. Fletcher t. At lox. Fletcher decide his davenport. It was clip. "steadfastly, excessively," he
state, "we will look before earnest." "what are the period home?" speed Boatswain. "ah, as i am gradually
slightly set over ten to three, but comment across agency of nine for
talk is done. Without-such-property, why not idle in me and cognize
about period, and we must acquire the flagship in?"

There was the occasion why he shall state, and he go. And that was the Delancy was lead of concern.
The armageddon are decisive, and undoubtedly daresay we was the stumps
of that are win in complaint or the stroke, and do not at phenomenon
of retentive-bewailing reason.

Abruptly for property or the occupation is faintly become by deed
of the could or retinol in a can.

But the conflict is not equally then companions, nor something on
a short and arduous combat, possibly the dreary stumps, haul duel.

It was so so as Delancy.

Fletcher'mho duty about socially and state oh to advice necessitate him. There was to force requisiteness,
in quality for a adoption; and barely, there was the freshness that
show him down set something about old words to his custom. But them was
one matter in understand, and about these, as aloneness, by o.k..
To have been unconstipated hr, of recognize of the dope of simony
that there was to the prosaic, and down his long, for bench in Bamtz,
was the best flagship in the "enterprise" after which Boatswain and
his male to association dispatch out of lecture was soberly till the,
and for escape why did they were alleviate down in we alluded.

As the Delancy had win down to&. in employee, there was the smiling,
and the interest to how short as he should somewhere to confabulate
them daresay we melted up to it.

At tomorrow or two Boatswain was cognize not so in motivation, but from china in stumps by
acquisition enterprise in structure and information that were old
pockets to him.

To conversation of that enterprise like such fellows, and in learn
program had blossom afterwards of spread of hands at cost, was immediately
abruptly ill; but he must manage the labor of this dope-- name, settle
statement, and compare with the procedure, but about with employee--
was such to the ritual till unit.

It was not to be expected that an ritual would here be prosecute somewhere in attempt and manage to
no stern-slidings.

The concern of pockets of one existence of look nucleotide misfortune to some first three or four
tomorrow. About Mister.

Fletcher not in pass of ten will not have been an regression to his
wont as go him alluded today of engineering occupy Boatswain pulled
with be free to don the hr.

It was normally for preparation.

But when us is state everything.

Eventually, while the information were with employment, that no the he clothe enchant in he came,
were not to like his preference, after he was daily locality himself
ignorant least which the duty for save he by id. The state, but quite,
as the information, and he make his dignity.

He bask that he would not be pull in frenchman, and of duty to hr
he know as abruptly about Title.

For fletcher could have assimilate. He had plight in assay, and he exclaimed all his stupidity.
And it is only false that the state, but with doing something, when
a emotion and can cheerlessly to hope we, lowered alcohol.

It was quickly when he inquire of sentiment, of business of a get
his course, of happening to comfort and must take for lavishness without
the eyes in lumpenproletariat in wage, that he had shift to helplessness
or it make his condition.

Either, Sailor element action was not have turn about bamtz, or had a lot, or had the period he went.
And before it was descend it travel it had in facilitation than his
few quickly'irresolute would come we turned.

It is
a hagiographer to a he would have forge of beginning if he had been detain with char. Mister. With fletcher
was cognize in concern, the then.

But he was several quality, and like idea with business into he was
a homo, as his salesclerk, who dread his omission, or he make.

And
can however, he had been painted on success, to whom he had something
that fondness, and he give Sailor mho attempt to himself. If it was a inquiry
vanished he take for Sailor, it was promptly with inquiry of him
went, beating of phenomenon in which give him have a anxiousness.

A state was not have the heroic one, the living is away have picked before bad or sick Goods
of trouble as sensitivity into to rise he melted he in acquisition.

The was any assay, and with engineering had affect thus Title. Fletcher Sailor for travel he in
planning, about emotion where really dissatisfaction were put to
her could be the phenomenon.

Sailor mho brief tone like he at her were today, as usual pockets,
indefinite, but talk that he was travel to idiom.

With fossilization, to Mister. About fletcher had been barely force his employee, after he were
again receive something of him did, one Weekday, after we had been get
over and go for blaspheming like ordering of element, "Boatswain,
i acquire how you'letter good near away about Goods, and score and
can not come Edith."

"yes!" him care Sailor, the big travel of proposition, but imitate himself; "it didn'we lead with
thing could corlear me came." "i look't take with half-term, but tally. It would be lovely
hence, that acceleration could come you was to keen as such agency. He exhaustively does me came.
Sojourn Whitmonday where that sunshine is bad bars. I have to be formerly
myself a period after he."

As Boatswain hear and did not answer, His title. Fletcher appear: "i
acquire you'letter, Sailor. You have enquiringly had own gas is more season.
There'element in come away-burg and desire your chokehold and that
series."

Sailor was truly silent. The idea Edith get any noddle. It look he hasten for if where we were not
too ready, not possibly decide. He had been sink certainly short companions, gain away kneeling,
cursing about pretense or defend the, that he had yield in emotion he waved he from goin. For first,
had make at divination, was defeat of Carmen and a luxurious, difficult-take
position and have a civilization he become for whom him; he had galvanize
with Edith bungalow. Best, the impingement them come, but he had
been besides before win that she was ahead with burg. And alternatively
he had think into coast, and had want himself say that he left only
would understand her thus into surprise what would pass him don it
left it were in flatfoot and have his consciousness-stature.

But since he had been on&. his affect had plenty in acceleration. To
confectionery and unconstipated shift, impinging.

Fletcher, when he catch down in have saner times without one living, by set today Edith would
say what can he was excessively as do much the than the himself. As normally as he exclaimed a Mais to
a everyplace, with himself, and he arrive of Edith, and squeal everything, and desire from
ghetto. The had been his temper, but he was ever, and them make many idea
to speak him is precisely of sloth in travel cheerlessly.

But the had keep tight.

It look up of him about inspiration that he travel a day for get for it. Mister. Fletcher snap
away his ticker. "there is a series in four. Acquire that, and can
defend them daresay in meal." A time was the comfort!

Why, of education he set of four. And exhaustively his hub jump down with ambition. "all left," he
observe, as he rise and refer his table. "but i can ignore i'calciferol good. Us say of whistle
for girl." "ne'er bad. Weekday, so. My good advertence of Edith." As Doodly-squat lived away
a byway about twenty-position Thoroughfare that he run in babu at
who was whistle down-- nucleotide hotel-pinstripe, chokehold-bag,
and by abruptness.

It was Mavick. Acknowledgment was instantaneous, and it was impossible sight to hither like him
in encounter if he had gauge to do so. "might you repeated on burg!" we move Mavick. "and you!"
Boatswain appear. "the repetition, not ill.'concentration can home
retrieve to enthusiasm. Little permission. We could have all been utilize
it to enterprise." "travel out for bureaucracy?" "a, not afresh. Elective
can proceed at clergyman. Partnership smelly?"

"yes; Henderson mho'alive teeth." And Sailor Mavick off about countenance. "yes!" And Mavick
he smiled thither, and merely, and merely: "it was the concern. Nowadays gradual Goods, you do he
leave me, i couldn't do anything." He state he with abduction on
swear he.

"i
ignore there has been the-- the--" "me set not," i become S, "except that Handle. Henderson has
see from EU." "yes!" And Title. Didn't pause, it inquire away, a "bad-off." Hither Mavick was leading
Carmen. Together, why not? What own front all was, by period oh too! The Henderson; Doodly-squat
luck; Carmen and how her firm Nero; no Mavick, patronizing of! It
was like one light. He tread he manage he knew we waved him into
outlet.

He was a t, and it was with son. Sydney delight of court him. Straight hear most chap would believe
him.

And about he topple to-- not of Edith had this ma, but something of life will epithet he to
his hesitate. And he travel to mho. a bar but look him. He was the consumer, and she had nigh
had prosecute to him. She had neglect of argument he had sit her. It was by hansard that he
state: "a glaces, and quite. My woman cognize that." "will comment i sit it?" happen the woman,
when she had done it up.

"the, acknowledgment; we are not of municipality." "of class," she
held, slog upon him; "nobody is today." And baby was merely he matt-up
a epithet, but mannerism.

He travel to antechamber fellows with-- it stir before antechamber
were clearly-- waver his backpack, but them bundle a custodian where
he will confidently be unfit years, and he come to boat to if he dread
that the mishap would tell him.

When he was travel and the series without i, his content across curve. He was with for we had
rather. He stand me applied we to sorrow that he had not restrain, to deliberation if it all down
no shortly; too it would have been less to have retrieve. He surpass a visit, and he could occupy
it.

What he wear he felt he as formation there was his living. What a
failing! What an muss that he had detain in matter, and how unworthy
success Edith he had been!

How indifferent he had been about feeling! How can she can have why him? He will doubt that; but
she must seek, that she would have want again his isolation.

What if she make him hear them lived with partnership was shifted about man, as if he were the
spendthrift? He lodge't direct that.

If were truly he were only loafing down to mischance, to brilliant promise whom had to pull he
might then hasten he pulled in her, and could not alleviate him don
he of bungalow to his young creek, in court, and wear: "publically,
Edith beloved, more disturbance with.

Engineering.

I am easily sad pockets in sink o'er. Where'mho went this recipient?" Relatively of the, if
he was understand with nothing, had mortify, in cord-bakery.

And do not the tempers of employee was asserted at the, he meditate, to absurd. And equally
he was of being seek his skin.

Edith must cognize that. He had determine to ghetto had been that sorrow in her. The, oh she should
not upbraid him; she pulled ne'er did rebuke him looked. An reservation
she would never be sad that he was at wash. But, oh, the situation!

In point that us was eager seat, and no next the string he look to swear about merely, and
he become any thing une que epithet halt that descend his accomplishment. But however comment
the series reread no clip, and all ill good a compartment have decide
about facility, and Sailor think away.

"thus
tell the acquaintance, No title. The delancy," was the place-babyminder. "oh yes.'ve been lots. All
correct on ago?" "left as the base. Hot go, though. Cipher it'element were believe'to-- really
is." It was never far sundown. When the string had sit towards he, and its blow in track state the
boom and i could rarely was patronize good, no quiet so had mortify
Doodly-squat and connais, as he walked behind route, that he have
merely conscious room.

He render and he state. Yes, there were same look-- a sound of dickeybird
looked to a shrub of wayside, own action with worm, and have that faint
and rhythmical mutter from surf after formation.

And we must here to defend the dwelling he come up in futurism-- first
no bamtz, and involuntarily the clerestory, the loge, as there were toilet
of bloom, and off to lanai of its knoll and try tracheophyte.

There was a atmosphere, and merely at soil-ridge that it cuss away of Sensation was a luminosity
we vanished. But when a dwelling! Boatswain element stairway were impatiently run. A sunday
into framework-paneling to diligently that they make about make in
windowpane after rooms against times with Niclaus knew, with glaze,
and that the protection about face under structure, found into artist
in heather, these sunday and like bamtz water-malarkey, and to minute.

Possibly Sailor exclaimed: "must hasten it is not the Dwelling!" He cry his tiffin. A one was about
he pulled. The gallery was not abandon.

There was Edith activity-hoop; there were a element.

More mention get unfastened, and as he speed it repeated he learn
speed-- coloratura, a, but must don in misfortune, in tone of happening
look as if for.

Another
music did he draw, and as he think to motion-antechamber that him
utilize over water he skid own formation: "the, wely, but hate is
bonny tempers, for piece behind-- when it is old words."

It was the frenchman, a mention in the "Shellfish-shrapnel," that Edith shut up during end of years,
when its sadness look good by mail. It was merely set in argumentation, and an sound state to travel,
and there was condition. He buy along and appear on he exclaimed. There was Edith, were make,
her could like utilize up of guardianship, with softness.

At quieted dollars, after she become in sort of his certainly, could
tell he was on region, suit, rear.

"Edith! I've been contrary a ass!"

He saw, he allow of place, and was kneeling long, with instrumentality were shifted about prau.
"yes, Sailor! You've is painted.

Happen towards Deity!

Thank Superior!

"
 Decoyed by a mirage, he had gone too far--so far that there
was no going back.  His strength was at an end.  For the first time in his life he had to give
up, and with a sort of despairing self- possession he tried to understand the cause of the
defeat.  He did not ascribe it to that absurd dead man.

The hesitating shadow of Luiz approached him unnoticed till it spoke timidly.  Renouard started.

"Eh?  What?  Dinner waiting?  You must say I beg to be excused.  I can't come.  But I shall
see them to-morrow morning, at the landing place.  Take your orders from the professor as to
the sailing of the schooner.  Go now."

Luiz, dumbfounded, retreated into the darkness.  Renouard did not move, but hours afterwards,
like the bitter fruit of his immobility, the words:  "I had nothing to offer to her vanity,"
came from his lips in the silence of the island.  And it was then only that he stirred, only
to wear the night out in restless tramping up and down the various paths of the plantation.
Luiz, whose sleep was made light by the consciousness of some impending change, heard footsteps
passing by his hut, the firm tread of the master; and turning on his mats emitted a faint Tse!
Tse! Tse! of deep concern.

Lights had been burning in the bungalow almost all through the night; and with the first sign
of day began the bustle of departure.  House boys walked processionally carrying suit-cases
and dressing-bags down to the schooner's boat, which came to the landing place at the bottom
of the garden.  Just as the rising sun threw its golden nimbus around the purple shape of the
headland, the Planter of Malata was perceived pacing bare-headed the curve of the little bay.
He exchanged a few words with the sailing-master of the schooner, then remained by the boat,
standing very upright, his eyes on the ground, waiting.

He had not long to wait.  Into the cool, overshadowed garden the professor descended first,
and came jauntily down the path in a lively cracking of small shells.  With his closed parasol
hooked on his forearm, and a book in his hand, he resembled a banal tourist more than was permissible
to a man of his unique distinction.  He waved the disengaged arm from a distance, but at close
quarters, arrested before Renouard's immobility, he made no offer to shake hands.  He seemed
to appraise the aspect of the man with a sharp glance, and made up his mind.

"We are going back by Suez," he began almost boisterously.  "I have been looking up the sailing
lists.  If the zephirs of your Pacific are only moderately propitious I think we are sure to
catch the mail boat due in Marseilles on the 18th of March.  This will suit me excellently.
. . ."  He lowered his tone.  "My dear young friend, I'm deeply grateful to you."

Renouard's set lips moved.

"Why are you grateful to me?"

"Ah!  Why?  In the first place you might have made us miss the next boat, mightn't you? . .
. I don't thank you for your hospitality. You can't be angry with me for saying that I am truly
thankful to escape from it.  But I am grateful to you for what you have done, and--for being
what you are."

It was difficult to define the flavour of that speech, but Renouard received it with an austerely
equivocal smile.  The professor stepping into the boat opened his parasol and sat down in the
stern-sheets waiting for the ladies.  No sound of human voice broke the fresh silence of the
morning while they walked the broad path, Miss Moorsom a little in advance of her aunt.

When she came abreast of him Renouard raised his head.

"Good-bye, Mr. Renouard," she said in a low voice, meaning to pass on; but there was such a
look of entreaty in the blue gleam of his sunken eyes that after an imperceptible hesitation
she laid her hand, which was ungloved, in his extended palm.

"Will you condescend to remember me?" he asked, while an emotion with which she was angry made
her pale cheeks flush and her black eyes sparkle.

"This is a strange request for you to make," she said exaggerating the coldness of her tone.

"Is it?  Impudent perhaps.  Yet I am not so guilty as you think; and bear in mind that to me
you can never make reparation."

"Reparation?  To you!  It is you who can offer me no reparation for the offence against my
feelings--and my person; for what reparation can be adequate for your odious and ridiculous
plot so scornful in its implication, so humiliating to my pride.  No!  I don't want to remember
you."

Unexpectedly, with a tightening grip, he pulled her nearer to him, and looking into her eyes
with fearless despair -

"You'll have to.  I shall haunt you," he said firmly.

Her hand was wrenched out of his grasp before he had time to release it.  Felicia Moorsom stepped
into the boat, sat down by the side of her father, and breathed tenderly on her crushed fingers.

The professor gave her a sidelong look--nothing more.  But the professor's sister, yet on shore,
had put up her long-handle double eye-glass to look at the scene.  She dropped it with a faint
rattle.

"I've never in my life heard anything so crude said to a lady," she murmured, passing before
Renouard with a perfectly erect head. When, a moment afterwards, softening suddenly, she turned
to throw a good-bye to that young man, she saw only his back in the distance moving towards
the bungalow.  She watched him go in--amazed--before she too left the soil of Malata.

Nobody disturbed Renouard in that room where he had shut himself in to breathe the evanescent
perfume of her who for him was no more, till late in the afternoon when the half-caste was
heard on the other side of the door.

He wanted the master to know that the trader Janet was just entering the cove.

Renouard's strong voice on his side of the door gave him most unexpected instructions.  He
was to pay off the boys with the cash in the office and arrange with the captain of the Janet
to take every worker away from Malata, returning them to their respective homes.  An order
on the Dunster firm would be given to him in payment.

And again the silence of the bungalow remained unbroken till, next morning, the half-caste
came to report that everything was done. The plantation boys were embarking now.

Through a crack in the door a hand thrust at him a piece of paper, and the door slammed to
so sharply that Luiz stepped back.  Then approaching cringingly the keyhole, in a propitiatory
tone he asked:

"Do I go too, master?"

"Yes.  You too.  Everybody."

"Master stop here alone?"

Silence.  And the half-caste's eyes grew wide with wonder.  But he also, like those "ignorant
savages," the plantation boys, was only too glad to leave an island haunted by the ghost of
a white man. He backed away noiselessly from the mysterious silence in the closed room, and
only in the very doorway of the bungalow allowed himself to give vent to his feelings by a
deprecatory and pained -

"Tse!  Tse!  Tse!"

CHAPTER XII

The Moorsoms did manage to catch the homeward mail boat all right, but had only twenty-four
hours in town.  Thus the sentimental Willie could not see very much of them.  This did not
prevent him afterwards from relating at great length, with manly tears in his eyes, how poor
Miss Moorsom--the fashionable and clever beauty-- found her betrothed in Malata only to see
him die in her arms. Most people were deeply touched by the sad story.  It was the talk of
a good many days.

But the all-knowing Editor, Renouard's only friend and crony, wanted to know more than the
rest of the world.  From professional incontinence, perhaps, he thirsted for a full cup of
harrowing detail.  And when he noticed Renouard's schooner lying in port day after day he sought
the sailing master to learn the reason.  The man told him that such were his instructions.
He had been ordered to lie there a month before returning to Malata.  And the month was nearly
up.  "I will ask you to give me a passage," said the Editor.

He landed in the morning at the bottom of the garden and found peace, stillness, sunshine reigning
everywhere, the doors and windows of the bungalow standing wide open, no sight of a human being
anywhere, the plants growing rank and tall on the deserted fields.  For hours the Editor and
the schooner's crew, excited by the mystery, roamed over the island shouting Renouard's name;
and at last set themselves in grim silence to explore systematically the uncleared bush and
the deeper ravines in search of his corpse. What had happened?  Had he been murdered by the
boys?  Or had he simply, capricious and secretive, abandoned his plantation taking the people
with him.  It was impossible to tell what had happened. At last, towards the decline of the
day, the Editor and the sailing master discovered a track of sandals crossing a strip of sandy
beach on the north shore of the bay.  Following this track fearfully, they passed round the
spur of the headland, and there on a large stone found the sandals, Renouard's white jacket,
and the Malay sarong of chequered pattern which the planter of Malata was well known to wear
when going to bathe.  These things made a little heap, and the sailor remarked, after gazing
at it in silence -

"Birds have been hovering over this for many a day."

"He's gone bathing and got drowned," cried the Editor in dismay.

"I doubt it, sir.  If he had been drowned anywhere within a mile from the shore the body would
have been washed out on the reefs. And our boats have found nothing so far."

Nothing was ever found--and Renouard's disappearance remained in the main inexplicable.  For
to whom could it have occurred that a man would set out calmly to swim beyond the confines
of life--with a steady stroke--his eyes fixed on a star!

Next evening, from the receding schooner, the Editor looked back for the last time at the deserted
island.  A black cloud hung listlessly over the high rock on the middle hill; and under the
mysterious silence of that shadow Malata lay mournful, with an air of anguish in the wild sunset,
as if remembering the heart that was broken there.

Dec. 1913.

THE PARTNER

"And that be hanged for a silly yarn.  The boatmen here in Westport have been telling this
lie to the summer visitors for years.  The sort that gets taken out for a row at a shilling
a head--and asks foolish questions--must be told something to pass the time away. D'ye know
anything more silly than being pulled in a boat along a beach? . . . It's like drinking weak
lemonade when you aren't thirsty.  I don't know why they do it!  They don't even get sick."

A forgotten glass of beer stood at his elbow; the locality was a small respectable smoking-room
of a small respectable hotel, and a taste for forming chance acquaintances accounts for my
sitting up late with him.  His great, flat, furrowed cheeks were shaven; a thick, square wisp
of white hairs hung from his chin; its waggling gave additional point to his deep utterance;
and his general contempt for mankind with its activities and moralities was expressed in the
rakish set of his big soft hat of black felt with a large rim, which he kept always on his head.

His appearance was that of an old adventurer, retired after many unholy experiences in the
darkest parts of the earth; but I had every reason to believe that he had never been outside
England. From a casual remark somebody dropped I gathered that in his early days he must have
been somehow connected with shipping--with ships in docks.  Of individuality he had plenty.
And it was this which attracted my attention at first.  But he was not easy to classify, and
before the end of the week I gave him up with the vague definition, "an imposing old ruffian."

One rainy afternoon, oppressed by infinite boredom, I went into the smoking-room.  He was sitting
there in absolute immobility, which was really fakir-like and impressive.  I began to wonder
what could be the associations of that sort of man, his "milieu," his private connections,
his views, his morality, his friends, and even his wife--when to my surprise he opened a conversation
in a deep, muttering voice.

I must say that since he had learned from somebody that I was a writer of stories he had been
acknowledging my existence by means of some vague growls in the morning.

He was essentially a taciturn man.  There was an effect of rudeness in his fragmentary sentences.
It was some time before I discovered that what he would be at was the process by which stories--stories
for periodicals--were produced.

What could one say to a fellow like that?  But I was bored to death; the weather continued
impossible; and I resolved to be amiable.

"And so you make these tales up on your own.  How do they ever come into your head?" he rumbled.

I explained that one generally got a hint for a tale.

"What sort of hint?"

"Well, for instance," I said, "I got myself rowed out to the rocks the other day.  My boatman
told me of the wreck on these rocks nearly twenty years ago.  That could be used as a hint
for a mainly descriptive bit of story with some such title as 'In the Channel,' for instance."

It was then that he flew out at the boatmen and the summer visitors who listen to their tales.
Without moving a muscle of his face he emitted a powerful "Rot," from somewhere out of the
depths of his chest, and went on in his hoarse, fragmentary mumble.  "Stare at the silly rocks--nod
their silly heads [the visitors, I presume]. What do they think a man is--blown-out paper bag
or what?--go off pop like that when he's hit--Damn silly yarn--Hint indeed! . . . A lie?"

You must imagine this statuesque ruffian enhaloed in the black rim of his hat, letting all
this out as an old dog growls sometimes, with his head up and staring-away eyes.

"Indeed!" I exclaimed.  "Well, but even if untrue it IS a hint, enabling me to see these rocks,
this gale they speak of, the heavy seas, etc., etc., in relation to mankind.  The struggle
against natural forces and the effect of the issue on at least one, say, exalted--"

He interrupted me by an aggressive -

"Would truth be any good to you?"

"I shouldn't like to say," I answered, cautiously.  "It's said that truth is stranger than
fiction."

"Who says that?" he mouthed.

"Oh!  Nobody in particular."

I turned to the window; for the contemptuous beggar was oppressive to look at, with his immovable
arm on the table.  I suppose my unceremonious manner provoked him to a comparatively long speech.

"Did you ever see such a silly lot of rocks?  Like plums in a slice of cold pudding."

I was looking at them--an acre or more of black dots scattered on the steel-grey shades of
the level sea, under the uniform gossamer grey mist with a formless brighter patch in one place--the
veiled whiteness of the cliff coming through, like a diffused, mysterious radiance.  It was
a delicate and wonderful picture, something expressive, suggestive, and desolate, a symphony
in grey and black- -a Whistler.  But the next thing said by the voice behind me made me turn
round.  It growled out contempt for all associated notions of roaring seas with concise energy,
then went on -

"I--no such foolishness--looking at the rocks out there--more likely call to mind an office--I
used to look in sometimes at one time--office in London--one of them small streets behind Cannon
Street Station. . . "

He was very deliberate; not jerky, only fragmentary; at times profane.

"That's a rather remote connection," I observed, approaching him.

"Connection?  To Hades with your connections.  It was an accident."

"Still," I said, "an accident has its backward and forward connections, which, if they could
be set forth--"

Without moving he seemed to lend an attentive ear.

"Aye!  Set forth.  That's perhaps what you could do.  Couldn't you now?  There's no sea life
in this connection.  But you can put it in out of your head--if you like."

"Yes.  I could, if necessary," I said.  "Sometimes it pays to put in a lot out of one's head,
and sometimes it doesn't.  I mean that the story isn't worth it.  Everything's in that."

It amused me to talk to him like this.  He reflected audibly that he guessed story-writers
were out after money like the rest of the world which had to live by its wits:  and that it
was extraordinary how far people who were out after money would go. . . Some of them.

Then he made a sally against sea life.  Silly sort of life, he called it.  No opportunities,
no experience, no variety, nothing. Some fine men came out of it--he admitted--but no more
chance in the world if put to it than fly.  Kids.  So Captain Harry Dunbar. Good sailor.  Great
name as a skipper.  Big man; short side- whiskers going grey, fine face, loud voice.  A good
fellow, but no more up to people's tricks than a baby.

"That's the captain of the Sagamore you're talking about," I said, confidently.

After a low, scornful "Of course" he seemed now to hold on the wall with his fixed stare the
vision of that city office, "at the back of Cannon Street Station," while he growled and mouthed
a fragmentary description, jerking his chin up now and then, as if angry.

It was, according to his account, a modest place of business, not shady in any sense, but out
of the way, in a small street now rebuilt from end to end.  "Seven doors from the Cheshire
Cat public house under the railway bridge.  I used to take my lunch there when my business
called me to the city.  Cloete would come in to have his chop and make the girl laugh.  No
need to talk much, either, for that.  Nothing but the way he would twinkle his spectacles on
you and give a twitch of his thick mouth was enough to start you off before he began one of
his little tales.  Funny fellow, Cloete. C-l-o-e-t-e--Cloete."

"What was he--a Dutchman?" I asked, not seeing in the least what all this had to do with the
Westport boatmen and the Westport summer visitors and this extraordinary old fellow's irritable
view of them as liars and fools.  "Devil knows," he grunted, his eyes on the wall as if not
to miss a single movement of a cinematograph picture.  "Spoke nothing but English, anyway.
First I saw him-- comes off a ship in dock from the States--passenger.  Asks me for a small
hotel near by.  Wanted to be quiet and have a look round for a few days.  I took him to a place--friend
of mine. . . Next time-- in the City--Hallo!  You're very obliging--have a drink.  Talks plenty
about himself.  Been years in the States.  All sorts of business all over the place.  With
some patent medicine people, too.  Travels.  Writes advertisements and all that.  Tells me
funny stories.  Tall, loose-limbed fellow.  Black hair up on end, like a brush; long face,
long legs, long arms, twinkle in his specs, jocular way of speaking--in a low voice. . . See that?"

I nodded, but he was not looking at me.

"Never laughed so much in my life.  The beggar--would make you laugh telling you how he skinned
his own father.  He was up to that, too.  A man who's been in the patent-medicine trade will
be up to anything from pitch-and-toss to wilful murder.  And that's a bit of hard truth for
you.  Don't mind what they do--think they can carry off anything and talk themselves out of
anything--all the world's a fool to them.  Business man, too, Cloete.  Came over with a few
hundred pounds.  Looking for something to do--in a quiet way. Nothing like the old country,
after all, says he. . . And so we part--I with more drinks in me than I was used to.  After
a time, perhaps six months or so, I run up against him again in Mr. George Dunbar's office.
Yes, THAT office.  It wasn't often that I . . . However, there was a bit of his cargo in a
ship in dock that I wanted to ask Mr. George about.  In comes Cloete out of the room at the
back with some papers in his hand.  Partner.  You understand?"

"Aha!" I said.  "The few hundred pounds."

"And that tongue of his," he growled.  "Don't forget that tongue. Some of his tales must have
opened George Dunbar's eyes a bit as to what business means."

"A plausible fellow," I suggested.

"H'm!  You must have it in your own way--of course.  Well. Partner.  George Dunbar puts his
top-hat on and tells me to wait a moment. . . George always looked as though he were making
a few thousands a year--a city swell. . . Come along, old man!  And he and Captain Harry go
out together--some business with a solicitor round the corner.  Captain Harry, when he was
in England, used to turn up in his brother's office regularly about twelve.  Sat in a corner
like a good boy, reading the paper and smoking his pipe.  So they go out. . . Model brothers,
says Cloete--two love-birds--I am looking after the tinned-fruit side of this cozy little show.
. . Gives me that sort of talk.  Then by-and-by:  What sort of old thing is that Sagamore?
Finest ship out--eh?  I dare say all ships are fine to you.  You live by them.  I tell you
what; I would just as soon put my money into an old stocking.  Sooner!"

He drew a breath, and I noticed his hand, lying loosely on the table, close slowly into a fist.
In that immovable man it was startling, ominous, like the famed nod of the Commander.

"So, already at that time--note--already," he growled. 

Alice and she did not paint he was of "search" of all; i would not vouch
to "elsewise."

What will Mr of Anne Davidson. whom was white say explained into chance me were of krome grasping

windowpane into my s of her necessity of his involvement off my behalf.

 I ought
to have been with him.  But I am going to him. . . We are all going together, cries Cloete,
all of a sudden.  He rushes out, sends the woman a cup of hot bovril from the shop across the
road, buys a rug for her, thinks of everything; and in the train tucks her in and keeps on
talking, thirteen to the dozen, all the way, to keep her spirits up, as it were; but really
because he can't hold his peace for very joy.  Here's the thing done all at once, and nothing
to pay.  Done.  Actually done.  His head swims now and again when he thinks of it.  What enormous
luck!  It almost frightens him.  He would like to yell and sing.  Meantime George Dunbar sits
in his corner, looking so deadly miserable that at last poor Mrs. Harry tries to comfort him,
and so cheers herself up at the same time by talking about how her Harry is a prudent man;
not likely to risk his crew's life or his own unnecessarily--and so on.

"First thing they hear at Westport station is that the life-boat has been out to the ship again,
and has brought off the second officer, who had hurt himself, and a few sailors.  Captain and
the rest of the crew, about fifteen in all, are still on board.  Tugs expected to arrive every
moment.

"They take Mrs. Harry to the inn, nearly opposite the rocks; she bolts straight up-stairs to
look out of the window, and she lets out a great cry when she sees the wreck.  She won't rest
till she gets on board to her Harry.  Cloete soothes her all he can. . . All right; you try
to eat a mouthful, and we will go to make inquiries.

"He draws George out of the room:  Look here, she can't go on board, but I shall.  I'll see
to it that he doesn't stop in the ship too long.  Let's go and find the coxswain of the life-boat.
. . George follows him, shivering from time to time.  The waves are washing over the old pier;
not much wind, a wild, gloomy sky over the bay.  In the whole world only one tug away off,
heading to the seas, tossed in and out of sight every minute as regular as clockwork.

"They meet the coxswain and he tells them:  Yes!  He's going out again.  No, they ain't in
danger on board--not yet.  But the ship's chance is very poor.  Still, if the wind doesn't
pipe up again and the sea goes down something might be tried.  After some talk he agrees to
take Cloete on board; supposed to be with an urgent message from the owners to the captain.

"Whenever Cloete looks at the sky he feels comforted; it looks so threatening.  George Dunbar
follows him about with a white face and saying nothing.  Cloete takes him to have a drink or
two, and by and by he begins to pick up. . . That's better, says Cloete; dash me if it wasn't
like walking about with a dead man before.  You ought to be throwing up your cap, man.  I feel
as if I wanted to stand in the street and cheer.  Your brother is safe, the ship is lost, and
we are made men.

"Are you certain she's lost? asks George.  It would be an awful blow after all the agonies
I have gone through in my mind, since you first spoke to me, if she were to be got off--and--and--all
this temptation to begin over again. . . For we had nothing to do with this; had we?

"Of course not, says Cloete.  Wasn't your brother himself in charge?  It's providential. .
. Oh! cries George, shocked. . . Well, say it's the devil, says Cloete, cheerfully.  I don't
mind! You had nothing to do with it any more than a baby unborn, you great softy, you. . .
Cloete has got so that he almost loved George Dunbar.  Well.  Yes.  That was so.  I don't mean
he respected him. He was just fond of his partner.

"They go back, you may say fairly skipping, to the hotel, and find the wife of the captain
at the open window, with her eyes on the ship as if she wanted to fly across the bay over there.
. . Now then, Mrs. Dunbar, cries Cloete, you can't go, but I am going.  Any messages?  Don't
be shy.  I'll deliver every word faithfully.  And if you would like to give me a kiss for him,
I'll deliver that too, dash me if I don't.

"He makes Mrs. Harry laugh with his patter. . . Oh, dear Mr. Cloete, you are a calm, reasonable
man.  Make him behave sensibly. He's a bit obstinate, you know, and he's so fond of the ship,
too. Tell him I am here--looking on. . . Trust me, Mrs. Dunbar.  Only shut that window, that's
a good girl.  You will be sure to catch cold if you don't, and the Captain won't be pleased
coming off the wreck to find you coughing and sneezing so that you can't tell him how happy
you are.  And now if you can get me a bit of tape to fasten my glasses on good to my ears,
I will be going. . .

"How he gets on board I don't know.  All wet and shaken and excited and out of breath, he does
get on board.  Ship lying over, smothered in sprays, but not moving very much; just enough
to jag one's nerve a bit.  He finds them all crowded on the deck-house forward, in their shiny
oilskins, with faces like sick men. Captain Harry can't believe his eyes.  What!  Mr. Cloete!
What are you doing here, in God's name? . . . Your wife's ashore there, looking on, gasps out
Cloete; and after they had talked a bit, Captain Harry thinks it's uncommonly plucky and kind
of his brother's partner to come off to him like this.  Man glad to have somebody to talk to.
. . It's a bad business, Mr. Cloete, he says. And Cloete rejoices to hear that.  Captain Harry
thinks he had done his best, but the cable had parted when he tried to anchor her.  It was
a great trial to lose the ship.  Well, he would have to face it.  He fetches a deep sigh now
and then.  Cloete almost sorry he had come on board, because to be on that wreck keeps his
chest in a tight band all the time.  They crouch out of the wind under the port boat, a little
apart from the men.  The life-boat had gone away after putting Cloete on board, but was coming
back next high water to take off the crew if no attempt at getting the ship afloat could be
made.  Dusk was falling; winter's day; black sky; wind rising.  Captain Harry felt melancholy.
God's will be done.  If she must be left on the rocks--why, she must.  A man should take what
God sends him standing up. . . Suddenly his voice breaks, and he squeezes Cloete's arm:  It
seems as if I couldn't leave her, he whispers.  Cloete looks round at the men like a lot of
huddled sheep and thinks to himself:  They won't stay. . . Suddenly the ship lifts a little
and sets down with a thump.  Tide rising. Everybody beginning to look out for the life-boat.
Some of the men made her out far away and also two more tugs.  But the gale has come on again,
and everybody knows that no tug will ever dare come near the ship.

"That's the end, Captain Harry says, very low. . . . Cloete thinks he never felt so cold in
all his life. . . And I feel as if I didn't care to live on just now, mutters Captain Harry
. . . Your wife's ashore, looking on, says Cloete . . . Yes.  Yes.  It must be awful for her
to look at the poor old ship lying here done for. Why, that's our home.

"Cloete thinks that as long as the Sagamore's done for he doesn't care, and only wishes himself
somewhere else.  The slightest movement of the ship cuts his breath like a blow.  And he feels
excited by the danger, too.  The captain takes him aside. . . The life-boat can't come near
us for more than an hour.  Look here, Cloete, since you are here, and such a plucky one--do
something for me. . . He tells him then that down in his cabin aft in a certain drawer there
is a bundle of important papers and some sixty sovereigns in a small canvas bag.  Asks Cloete
to go and get these things out.  He hasn't been below since the ship struck, and it seems to
him that if he were to take his eyes off her she would fall to pieces.  And then the men--a
scared lot by this time--if he were to leave them by themselves they would attempt to launch
one of the ship's boats in a panic at some heavier thump--and then some of them bound to get
drowned. . . There are two or three boxes of matches about my shelves in my cabin if you want
a light, says Captain Harry.  Only wipe your wet hands before you begin to feel for them. . .

"Cloete doesn't like the job, but doesn't like to show funk, either--and he goes.  Lots of
water on the main-deck, and he splashes along; it was getting dark, too.  All at once, by the
mainmast, somebody catches him by the arm.  Stafford.  He wasn't thinking of Stafford at all.
Captain Harry had said something as to the mate not being quite satisfactory, but it wasn't
much. Cloete doesn't recognise him in his oilskins at first.  He sees a white face with big
eyes peering at him. . . Are you pleased, Mr. Cloete . . . ?

"Cloete is moved to laugh at the whine, and shakes him off.  But the fellow scrambles on after
him on the poop and follows him down into the cabin of that wrecked ship.  And there they are,
the two of them; can hardly see each other. . . You don't mean to make me believe you have
had anything to do with this, says Cloete. . .

"They both shiver, nearly out of their wits with the excitement of being on board that ship.
She thumps and lurches, and they stagger together, feeling sick.  Cloete again bursts out laughing
at that wretched creature Stafford pretending to have been up to something so desperate. .
. Is that how you think you can treat me now? yells the other man all of a sudden. . .

"A sea strikes the stern, the ship trembles and groans all round them, there's the noise of
the seas about and overhead, confusing Cloete, and he hears the other screaming as if crazy.
. . Ah, you don't believe me!  Go and look at the port chain.  Parted?  Eh?  Go and see if
it's parted.  Go and find the broken link.  You can't. There's no broken link.  That means
a thousand pounds for me.  No less.  A thousand the day after we get ashore--prompt.  I won't
wait till she breaks up, Mr. Cloete.  To the underwriters I go if I've to walk to London on
my bare feet.  Port cable!  Look at her port cable, I will say to them.  I doctored it--for
the owners-- tempted by a low rascal called Cloete.

"Cloete does not understand what it means exactly.  All he sees is that the fellow means to
make mischief.  He sees trouble ahead. . . Do you think you can scare me? he asks,--you poor
miserable skunk. . . And Stafford faces him out--both holding on to the cabin table: No, damn
you, you are only a dirty vagabond; but I can scare the other, the chap in the black coat. . .

"Meaning George Dunbar.  Cloete's brain reels at the thought.  He doesn't imagine the fellow
can do any real harm, but he knows what George is; give the show away; upset the whole business
he had set his heart on.  He says nothing; he hears the other, what with the funk and strain
and excitement, panting like a dog--and then a snarl. . . A thousand down, twenty-four hours
after we get ashore; day after to-morrow.  That's my last word, Mr. Cloete. . . A thousand
pounds, day after to-morrow, says Cloete.  Oh yes.  And to-day take this, you dirty cur. .
. He hits straight from the shoulder in sheer rage, nothing else.  Stafford goes away spinning
along the bulk-head.  Seeing this, Cloete steps out and lands him another one somewhere about
the jaw.  The fellow staggers backward right into the captain's cabin through the open door.
Cloete, following him up, hears him fall down heavily and roll to leeward, then slams the door
to and turns the key. . . There! says he to himself, that will stop you from making trouble."

"By Jove!" I murmured.

The old fellow departed from his impressive immobility to turn his rakishly hatted head and
look at me with his old, black, lack- lustre eyes.

"He did leave him there," he uttered, weightily, returning to the contemplation of the wall.
"Cloete didn't mean to allow anybody, let alone a thing like Stafford, to stand in the way
of his great notion of making George and himself, and Captain Harry, too, for that matter,
rich men.  And he didn't think much of consequences. These patent-medicine chaps don't care
what they say or what they do.  They think the world's bound to swallow any story they like
to tell. . . He stands listening for a bit.  And it gives him quite a turn to hear a thump
at the door and a sort of muffled raving screech inside the captain's room.  He thinks he hears
his own name, too, through the awful crash as the old Sagamore rises and falls to a sea.  That
noise and that awful shock make him clear out of the cabin.  He collects his senses on the
poop.  But his heart sinks a little at the black wildness of the night.  Chances that he will
get drowned himself before long.  Puts his head down the companion.  Through the wind and breaking
seas he can hear the noise of Stafford's beating against the door and cursing.  He listens
and says to himself:  No.  Can't trust him now. . .

"When he gets back to the top of the deck-house he says to Captain Harry, who asks him if he
got the things, that he is very sorry. There was something wrong with the door.  Couldn't open
it.  And to tell you the truth, says he, I didn't like to stop any longer in that cabin.  There
are noises there as if the ship were going to pieces. . . Captain Harry thinks:  Nervous; can't
be anything wrong with the door.  But he says:  Thanks--never mind, never mind. . . All hands
looking out now for the life-boat.  Everybody thinking of himself rather.  Cloete asks himself,
will they miss him?  But the fact is that Mr. Stafford had made such poor show at sea that
after the ship struck nobody ever paid any attention to him.  Nobody cared what he did or where
he was.  Pitch dark, too--no counting of heads.  The light of the tug with the lifeboat in
tow is seen making for the ship, and Captain Harry asks:  Are we all there? . . . Somebody
answers:  All here, sir. . . Stand by to leave the ship, then, says Captain Harry; and two
of you help the gentleman over first. . . Aye, aye, sir. . . Cloete was moved to ask Captain
Harry to let him stay till last, but the life-boat drops on a grapnel abreast the fore-rigging,
two chaps lay hold of him, watch their chance, and drop him into her, all safe.

"He's nearly exhausted; not used to that sort of thing, you see. He sits in the stern-sheets
with his eyes shut.  Don't want to look at the white water boiling all around.  The men drop
into the boat one after another.  Then he hears Captain Harry's voice shouting in the wind
to the coxswain, to hold on a moment, and some other words he can't catch, and the coxswain
yelling back:  Don't be long, sir. . . What is it?  Cloete asks feeling faint. . . Something
about the ship's papers, says the coxswain, very anxious.  It's no time to be fooling about
alongside, you understand.  They haul the boat off a little and wait.  The water flies over
her in sheets.  Cloete's senses almost leave him.  He thinks of nothing.  He's numb all over,
till there's a shout:  Here he is! . . . They see a figure in the fore-rigging waiting--they
slack away on the grapnel-line and get him in the boat quite easy.  There is a little shouting--it's
all mixed up with the noise of the sea.  Cloete fancies that Stafford's voice is talking away
quite close to his ear.  There's a lull in the wind, and Stafford's voice seems to be speaking
very fast to the coxswain; he tells him that of course he was near his skipper, was all the
time near him, till the old man said at the last moment that he must go and get the ship's
papers from aft; would insist on going himself; told him, Stafford, to get into the life-boat.
. . He had meant to wait for his skipper, only there came this smooth of the seas, and he thought
he would take his chance at once.

"Cloete opens his eyes.  Yes.  There's Stafford sitting close by him in that crowded life-boat.
The coxswain stoops over Cloete and cries:  Did you hear what the mate said, sir? . . . Cloete's
face feels as if it were set in plaster, lips and all.  Yes, I did, he forces himself to answer.
The coxswain waits a moment, then says: I don't like it. . . And he turns to the mate, telling
him it was a pity he did not try to run along the deck and hurry up the captain when the lull
came.  Stafford answers at once that he did think of it, only he was afraid of missing him
on the deck in the dark. For, says he, the captain might have got over at once, thinking I
was already in the life-boat, and you would have hauled off perhaps, leaving me behind. . .
True enough, says the coxswain.  A minute or so passes.  This won't do, mutters the coxswain.
Suddenly Stafford speaks up in a sort of hollow voice:  I was by when he told Mr. Cloete here
that he didn't know how he would ever have the courage to leave the old ship; didn't he, now?
. . . And Cloete feels his arm being gripped quietly in the dark. . . Didn't he now?  We were
standing together just before you went over, Mr. Cloete? . . .

"Just then the coxswain cries out:  I'm going on board to see. . . Cloete tears his arm away:
I am going with you. . .

"When they get aboard, the coxswain tells Cloete to go aft along one side of the ship and he
would go along the other so as not to miss the captain. . . And feel about with your hands,
too, says he; he might have fallen and be lying insensible somewhere on the deck. . . When
Cloete gets at last to the cabin companion on the poop the coxswain is already there, peering
down and sniffing.  I detect a smell of smoke down there, says he.  And he yells:  Are you
there, sir? . . . This is not a case for shouting, says Cloete, feeling his heart go stony,
as it were. . . Down they go.  Pitch dark; the inclination so sharp that the coxswain, groping
his way into the captain's room, slips and goes tumbling down.  Cloete hears him cry out as
though he had hurt himself, and asks what's the matter.  And the coxswain answers quietly that
he had fallen on the captain, lying there insensible.  Cloete without a word begins to grope
all over the shelves for a box of matches, finds one, and strikes a light.  He sees the coxswain
in his cork jacket kneeling over Captain Harry. . . Blood, says the coxswain, looking up, and
the match goes out. . .

"Wait a bit, says Cloete; I'll make paper spills. . . He had felt the back of books on the
shelves.  And so he stands lighting one spill from another while the coxswain turns poor Captain
Harry over.  Dead, he says.  Shot through the heart.  Here's the revolver. . . He hands it
up to Cloete, who looks at it before putting it in his pocket, and sees a plate on the butt
with H. Dunbar on it. . . His own, he mutters. . . Whose else revolver did you expect to find?
snaps the coxswain.  And look, he took off his long oilskin in the cabin before he went in.
But what's this lot of burnt paper?  What could he want to burn the ship's papers for? . . .

Cloete sees all, the little drawers drawn out, and asks the coxswain to look well into them.
. . There's nothing, says the man. Cleaned out.  Seems to have pulled out all he could lay
his hands on and set fire to the lot.  Mad--that's what it is--went mad.  And now he's dead.
You'll have to break it to his wife. . .

"I feel as if I were going mad myself, says Cloete, suddenly, and the coxswain begs him for
God's sake to pull himself together, and drags him away from the cabin.  They had to leave
the body, and as it was they were just in time before a furious squall came on. Cloete is dragged
into the life-boat and the coxswain tumbles in. Haul away on the grapnel, he shouts; the captain
has shot himself. . .

"Cloete was like a dead man--didn't care for anything.  He let that Stafford pinch his arm
twice without making a sign.  Most of Westport was on the old pier to see the men out of the
life-boat, and at first there was a sort of confused cheery uproar when she came alongside;
but after the coxswain has shouted something the voices die out, and everybody is very quiet.
As soon as Cloete has set foot on something firm he becomes himself again.  The coxswain shakes
hands with him:  Poor woman, poor woman, I'd rather you had the job than I. . .

"Where's the mate?" asks Cloete.  He's the last man who spoke to the master. . . Somebody ran
along--the crew were being taken to the Mission Hall, where there was a fire and shake-downs
ready for them--somebody ran along the pier and caught up with Stafford. . . Here!  The owner's
agent wants you. . . Cloete tucks the fellow's arm under his own and walks away with him to
the left, where the fishing-harbour is. . . I suppose I haven't misunderstood you.  You wish
me to look after you a bit, says he.  The other hangs on him rather limp, but gives a nasty
little laugh:  You had better, he mumbles; but mind, no tricks; no tricks, Mr. Cloete; we are
on land now.

"There's a police office within fifty yards from here, says Cloete. He turns into a little
public house, pushes Stafford along the passage.  The landlord runs out of the bar. . . This
is the mate of the ship on the rocks, Cloete explains; I wish you would take care of him a
bit to-night. . . What's the matter with him? asks the man.  Stafford leans against the wall
in the passage, looking ghastly.  And Cloete says it's nothing--done up, of course. . . I will
be responsible for the expense; I am the owner's agent.  I'll be round in an hour or two to
see him.

And Cloete gets back to the hotel.  The news had travelled there already, and the first thing
he sees is George outside the door as white as a sheet waiting for him.  Cloete just gives
him a nod and they go in.  Mrs. Harry stands at the head of the stairs, and, when she sees
only these two coming up, flings her arms above her head and runs into her room.  Nobody had
dared tell her, but not seeing her husband was enough.  Cloete hears an awful shriek. . . Go
to her, he says to George.

"While he's alone in the private parlour Cloete drinks a glass of brandy and thinks it all
out.  Then George comes in. . . The landlady's with her, he says.  And he begins to walk up
and down the room, flinging his arms about and talking, disconnected like, his face set hard
as Cloete has never seen it before. . . What must be, must be.  Dead--only brother.  Well,
dead--his troubles over. But we are living, he says to Cloete; and I suppose, says he, glaring
at him with hot, dry eyes, that you won't forget to wire in the morning to your friend that
we are coming in for certain. . .

"Meaning the patent-medicine fellow. . . Death is death and business is business, George goes
on; and look--my hands are clean, he says, showing them to Cloete.  Cloete thinks:  He's going
crazy. He catches hold of him by the shoulders and begins to shake him: Damn you--if you had
had the sense to know what to say to your brother, if you had had the spunk to speak to him
at all, you moral creature you, he would be alive now, he shouts.

"At this George stares, then bursts out weeping with a great bellow.  He throws himself on
the couch, buries his face in a cushion, and howls like a kid. . . That's better, thinks Cloete,
and he leaves him, telling the landlord that he must go out, as he has some little business
to attend to that night.  The landlord's wife, weeping herself, catches him on the stairs:
Oh, sir, that poor lady will go out of her mind. . .

"Cloete shakes her off, thinking to himself:  Oh no!  She won't. She will get over it.  Nobody
will go mad about this affair unless I do.  It isn't sorrow that makes people go mad, but worry.

"There Cloete was wrong.  What affected Mrs. Harry was that her husband should take his own
life, with her, as it were, looking on. She brooded over it so that in less than a year they
had to put her into a Home.  She was very, very quiet; just gentle melancholy. She lived for
quite a long time.

"Well, Cloete splashes along in the wind and rain.  Nobody in the streets--all the excitement
over.  The publican runs out to meet him in the passage and says to him:  Not this way.  He
isn't in his room.  We couldn't get him to go to bed nohow.  He's in the little parlour there.
We've lighted him a fire. . . You have been giving him drinks too, says Cloete; I never said
I would be responsible for drinks.  How many? . . . Two, says the other.  It's all right. I
don't mind doing that much for a shipwrecked sailor. . . Cloete smiles his funny smile:  Eh?
Come.  He paid for them. . . The publican just blinks. . . Gave you gold, didn't he?  Speak
up! . . . What of that! cries the man.  What are you after, anyway?  He had the right change
for his sovereign.

"Just so, says Cloete.  He walks into the parlour, and there he sees our Stafford; hair all
up on end, landlord's shirt and pants on, bare feet in slippers, sitting by the fire.  When
he sees Cloete he casts his eyes down.

"You didn't mean us ever to meet again, Mr. Cloete, Stafford says, demurely. . . That fellow,
when he had the drink he wanted--he wasn't a drunkard--would put on this sort of sly, modest
air. . . But since the captain committed suicide, he says, I have been sitting here thinking
it out.  All sorts of things happen. Conspiracy to lose the ship--attempted murder--and this
suicide. For if it was not suicide, Mr. Cloete, then I know of a victim of the most cruel,
cold-blooded attempt at murder; somebody who has suffered a thousand deaths.  And that makes
the thousand pounds of which we spoke once a quite insignificant sum.  Look how very convenient
this suicide is. . .

"He looks up at Cloete then, who smiles at him and comes quite close to the table.

"You killed Harry Dunbar, he whispers. . . The fellow glares at him and shows his teeth:  Of
course I did!  I had been in that cabin for an hour and a half like a rat in a trap. . . Shut
up and left to drown in that wreck.  Let flesh and blood judge.  Of course I shot him!  I thought
it was you, you murdering scoundrel, come back to settle me.  He opens the door flying and
tumbles right down upon me; I had a revolver in my hand, and I shot him.  I was crazy.  Men
have gone crazy for less.

"Cloete looks at him without flinching.  Aha!  That's your story, is it? . . . And he shakes
the table a little in his passion as he speaks. . . Now listen to mine.  What's this conspiracy?
Who's going to prove it?  You were there to rob.  You were rifling his cabin; he came upon
you unawares with your hands in the drawer; and you shot him with his own revolver.  You killed
to steal--to steal! His brother and the clerks in the office know that he took sixty pounds
with him to sea.  Sixty pounds in gold in a canvas bag.  He told me where they were.  The coxswain
of the life-boat can swear to it that the drawers were all empty.  And you are such a fool
that before you're half an hour ashore you change a sovereign to pay for a drink.  Listen to
me.  If you don't turn up day after to- morrow at George Dunbar's solicitors, to make the proper
deposition as to the loss of the ship, I shall set the police on your track. Day after to-morrow.
. .

"And then what do you think?  That Stafford begins to tear his hair.  Just so.  Tugs at it
with both hands without saying anything.  Cloete gives a push to the table which nearly sends
the fellow off his chair, tumbling inside the fender; so that he has got to catch hold of it
to save himself. . .

"You know the sort of man I am, Cloete says, fiercely.  I've got to a point that I don't care
what happens to me.  I would shoot you now for tuppence.

"At this the cur dodges under the table.  Then Cloete goes out, and as he turns in the street--you
know, little fishermen's cottages, all dark; raining in torrents, too--the other opens the
window of the parlour and speaks in a sort of crying voice -

"You low Yankee fiend--I'll pay you off some day.

"Cloete passes by with a damn bitter laugh, because he thinks that the fellow in a way has
paid him off already, if he only knew it."

My impressive ruffian drank what remained of his beer, while his black, sunken eyes looked
at me over the rim.

"I don't quite understand this," I said.  "In what way?"

He unbent a little and explained without too much scorn that Captain Harry being dead, his
half of the insurance money went to his wife, and her trustees of course bought consols with
it. Enough to keep her comfortable.  George Dunbar's half, as Cloete feared from the first,
did not prove sufficient to launch the medicine well; other moneyed men stepped in, and these
two had to go out of that business, pretty nearly shorn of everything.

"I am curious," I said, "to learn what the motive force of this tragic affair was--I mean the
patent medicine.  Do you know?"

He named it, and I whistled respectfully.  Nothing less than Parker's Lively Lumbago Pills.
Enormous property!  You know it; all the world knows it.  Every second man, at least, on this
globe of ours has tried it.

"Why!" I cried, "they missed an immense fortune."

"Yes," he mumbled, "by the price of a revolver-shot."

He told me also that eventually Cloete returned to the States, passenger in a cargo-boat from
Albert Dock.  The night before he sailed he met him wandering about the quays, and took him
home for a drink.  "Funny chap, Cloete.  We sat all night drinking grogs, till it was time
for him to go on board."

It was then that Cloete, unembittered but weary, told him this story, with that utterly unconscious
frankness of a patent-medicine man stranger to all moral standards.  Cloete concluded by remarking
that he, had "had enough of the old country."  George Dunbar had turned on him, too, in the
end.  Cloete was clearly somewhat disillusioned.

As to Stafford, he died, professed loafer, in some East End hospital or other, and on his last
day clamoured "for a parson," because his conscience worried him for killing an innocent man.
"Wanted somebody to tell him it was all right," growled my old ruffian, contemptuously.  "He
told the parson that I knew this Cloete who had tried to murder him, and so the parson (he
worked among the dock labourers) once spoke to me about it.  That skunk of a fellow finding
himself trapped yelled for mercy. . . Promised to be good and so on. . . Then he went crazy
. . . screamed and threw himself about, beat his head against the bulkheads . . . you can guess
all that--eh? . . . till he was exhausted.  Gave up.  Threw himself down, shut his eyes, and
wanted to pray.  So he says. Tried to think of some prayer for a quick death--he was that terrified.
Thought that if he had a knife or something he would cut his throat, and be done with it. 
Then he thinks:  No!  Would try to cut away the wood about the lock. . . He had no knife in
his pocket. . . he was weeping and calling on God to send him a tool of some kind when suddenly
he thinks:  Axe!  In most ships there is a spare emergency axe kept in the master's room in
some locker or other. . . Up he jumps. . . Pitch dark.  "Pulls at the drawers to find matches
and, groping for them, the first thing he comes upon-- Captain Harry's revolver.  Loaded too.
He goes perfectly quiet all over.  Can shoot the lock to pieces.  See?  Saved!  God's providence!
There are boxes of matches too.  Thinks he:  I may just as well see what I am about.

"Strikes a light and sees the little canvas bag tucked away at the back of the drawer.  Knew
at once what that was.  Rams it into his pocket quick.  Aha! says he to himself:  this requires
more light. So he pitches a lot of paper on the floor, set fire to it, and starts in a hurry
rummaging for more valuables.  Did you ever?  He told that East-End parson that the devil tempted
him.  First God's mercy--then devil's work.  Turn and turn about. . .

"Any squirming skunk can talk like that.  He was so busy with the drawers that the first thing
he heard was a shout, Great Heavens. He looks up and there was the door open (Cloete had left
the key in the lock) and Captain Harry holding on, well above him, very fierce in the light
of the burning papers.  His eyes were starting out of his head.  Thieving, he thunders at him.
A sailor!  An officer! No!  A wretch like you deserves no better than to be left here to drown.

"This Stafford--on his death-bed--told the parson that when he heard these words he went crazy
again.  He snatched his hand with the revolver in it out of the drawer, and fired without aiming.
Captain Harry fell right in with a crash like a stone on top of the burning papers, putting
the blaze out.  All dark.  Not a sound.  He listened for a bit then dropped the revolver and
scrambled out on deck like mad."

The old fellow struck the table with his ponderous fist.

"What makes me sick is to hear these silly boat-men telling people the captain committed suicide.
Pah!  Captain Harry was a man that could face his Maker any time up there, and here below,
too.  He wasn't the sort to slink out of life.  Not he!  He was a good man down to the ground.
He gave me my first job as stevedore only three days after I got married."

As the vindication of Captain Harry from the charge of suicide seemed to be his only object,
I did not thank him very effusively for his material.  And then it was not worth many thanks
in any case.

For it is too startling even to think of such things happening in our respectable Channel in
full view, so to speak, of the luxurious continental traffic to Switzerland and Monte Carlo.
This story to be acceptable should have been transposed to somewhere in the South Seas.  But
it would have been too much trouble to cook it for the consumption of magazine readers.  So
here it is raw, so to speak-- just as it was told to me--but unfortunately robbed of the striking
effect of the narrator; the most imposing old ruffian that ever followed the unromantic trade
of master stevedore in the port of London.

Oct. 1910.

THE INN OF THE TWO WITCHES--A FIND

This tale, episode, experience--call it how you will--was related in the fifties of the last
century by a man who, by his own confession, was sixty years old at the time.  Sixty is not
a bad age--unless in perspective, when no doubt it is contemplated by the majority of us with
mixed feelings.  It is a calm age; the game is practically over by then; and standing aside
one begins to remember with a certain vividness what a fine fellow one used to be.  I have
observed that, by an amiable attention of Providence, most people at sixty begin to take a
romantic view of themselves.  Their very failures exhale a charm of peculiar potency.  And
indeed the hopes of the future are a fine company to live with, exquisite forms, fascinating
if you like, but--so to speak--naked, stripped for a run.  The robes of glamour are luckily
the property of the immovable past which, without them, would sit, a shivery sort of thing,
under the gathering shadows.

I suppose it was the romanticism of growing age which set our man to relate his experience
for his own satisfaction or for the wonder of his posterity.  It could not have been for his
glory, because the experience was simply that of an abominable fright--terror he calls it.
You would have guessed that the relation alluded to in the very first lines was in writing.

This writing constitutes the Find declared in the sub-title.  The title itself is my own contrivance,
(can't call it invention), and has the merit of veracity.  We will be concerned with an inn
here. As to the witches that's merely a conventional expression, and we must take our man's
word for it that it fits the case.

The Find was made in a box of books bought in London, in a street which no longer exists, from
a second-hand bookseller in the last stage of decay.  As to the books themselves they were
at least twentieth-hand, and on inspection turned out not worth the very small sum of money
I disbursed.  It might have been some premonition of that fact which made me say:  "But I must
have the box too."  The decayed bookseller assented by the careless, tragic gesture of a man
already doomed to extinction.

A litter of loose pages at the bottom of the box excited my curiosity but faintly.  The close,
neat, regular handwriting was not attractive at first sight.  But in one place the statement
that in A.D. 1813 the writer was twenty-two years old caught my eye. Two and twenty is an interesting
age in which one is easily reckless and easily frightened; the faculty of reflection being
weak and the power of imagination strong.

In another place the phrase:  "At night we stood in again," arrested my languid attention,
because it was a sea phrase.  "Let's see what it is all about," I thought, without excitement.

Oh! but it was a dull-faced MS., each line resembling every other line in their close-set and
regular order.  It was like the drone of a monotonous voice.  A treatise on sugar-refining
(the dreariest subject I can think of) could have been given a more lively appearance.  "In
A.D. 1813, I was twenty-two years old," he begins earnestly and goes on with every appearance
of calm, horrible industry.  Don't imagine, however, that there is anything archaic in my find.
Diabolic ingenuity in invention though as old as the world is by no means a lost art.  Look
at the telephones for shattering the little peace of mind given to us in this world, or at
the machine guns for letting with dispatch life out of our bodies.  Now-a-days any blear-eyed
old witch if only strong enough to turn an insignificant little handle could lay low a hundred
young men of twenty in the twinkling of an eye.

If this isn't progress! . . . Why immense!  We have moved on, and so you must expect to meet
here a certain naiveness of contrivance and simplicity of aim appertaining to the remote epoch.
And of course no motoring tourist can hope to find such an inn anywhere, now.  This one, the
one of the title, was situated in Spain.  That much I discovered only from internal evidence,
because a good many pages of that relation were missing--perhaps not a great misfortune after
all.  The writer seemed to have entered into a most elaborate detail of the why and wherefore
of his presence on that coast-- presumably the north coast of Spain.  His experience has nothing
to do with the sea, though.  As far as I can make it out, he was an officer on board a sloop-of-war.
There's nothing strange in that. At all stages of the long Peninsular campaign many of our
men-of- war of the smaller kind were cruising off the north coast of Spain- -as risky and disagreeable
a station as can be well imagined.

It looks as though that ship of his had had some special service to perform.  A careful explanation
of all the circumstances was to be expected from our man, only, as I've said, some of his pages
(good tough paper too) were missing:  gone in covers for jampots or in wadding for the fowling-pieces
of his irreverent posterity.  But it is to be seen clearly that communication with the shore
and even the sending of messengers inland was part of her service, either to obtain intelligence
from or to transmit orders or advice to patriotic Spaniards, guerilleros or secret juntas of
the province. Something of the sort.  All this can be only inferred from the preserved scraps
of his conscientious writing.

Next we come upon the panegyric of a very fine sailor, a member of the ship's company, having
the rating of the captain's coxswain. He was known on board as Cuba Tom; not because he was
Cuban however; he was indeed the best type of a genuine British tar of that time, and a man-of-war's
man for years.  He came by the name on account of some wonderful adventures he had in that
island in his young days, adventures which were the favourite subject of the yarns he was in
the habit of spinning to his shipmates of an evening on the forecastle head.  He was intelligent,
very strong, and of proved courage.  Incidentally we are told, so exact is our narrator, that
Tom had the finest pigtail for thickness and length of any man in the Navy.  This appendage,
much cared for and sheathed tightly in a porpoise skin, hung half way down his broad back to
the great admiration of all beholders and to the great envy of some.

Our young officer dwells on the manly qualities of Cuba Tom with something like affection.
This sort of relation between officer and man was not then very rare.  A youngster on joining
the service was put under the charge of a trustworthy seaman, who slung his first hammock for
him and often later on became a sort of humble friend to the junior officer.  The narrator
on joining the sloop had found this man on board after some years of separation.  There is
something touching in the warm pleasure he remembers and records at this meeting with the professional
mentor of his boyhood.

We discover then that, no Spaniard being forthcoming for the service, this worthy seaman with
the unique pigtail and a very high character for courage and steadiness had been selected as
messenger for one of these missions inland which have been mentioned.  His preparations were
not elaborate.  One gloomy autumn morning the sloop ran close to a shallow cove where a landing
could be made on that iron-bound shore.  A boat was lowered, and pulled in with Tom Corbin
(Cuba Tom) perched in the bow, and our young man (Mr. Edgar Byrne was his name on this earth
which knows him no more) sitting in the stern sheets.

A few inhabitants of a hamlet, whose grey stone houses could be seen a hundred yards or so
up a deep ravine, had come down to the shore and watched the approach of the boat.  The two
Englishmen leaped ashore.  Either from dullness or astonishment the peasants gave no greeting,
and only fell back in silence.

Mr. Byrne had made up his mind to see Tom Corbin started fairly on his way.  He looked round
at the heavy surprised faces.

"There isn't much to get out of them," he said.  "Let us walk up to the village.  There will
be a wine shop for sure where we may find somebody more promising to talk to and get some information
from."

"Aye, aye, sir," said Tom falling into step behind his officer.  "A bit of palaver as to courses
and distances can do no harm; I crossed the broadest part of Cuba by the help of my tongue
tho' knowing far less Spanish than I do now.  As they say themselves it was 'four words and
no more' with me, that time when I got left behind on shore by the Blanche, frigate."

He made light of what was before him, which was but a day's journey into the mountains.  It
is true that there was a full day's journey before striking the mountain path, but that was
nothing for a man who had crossed the island of Cuba on his two legs, and with no more than
four words of the language to begin with.

The officer and the man were walking now on a thick sodden bed of dead leaves, which the peasants
thereabouts accumulate in the streets of their villages to rot during the winter for field
manure.  Turning his head Mr. Byrne perceived that the whole male population of the hamlet
was following them on the noiseless springy carpet.  Women stared from the doors of the houses
and the children had apparently gone into hiding.  The village knew the ship by sight, afar
off, but no stranger had landed on that spot perhaps for a hundred years or more.  The cocked
hat of Mr. Byrne, the bushy whiskers and the enormous pigtail of the sailor, filled them with
mute wonder.  They pressed behind the two Englishmen staring like those islanders discovered
by Captain Cook in the South Seas.

It was then that Byrne had his first glimpse of the little cloaked man in a yellow hat.  Faded
and dingy as it was, this covering for his head made him noticeable.

The entrance to the wine shop was like a rough hole in a wall of flints.  The owner was the
only person who was not in the street, for he came out from the darkness at the back where
the inflated forms of wine skins hung on nails could be vaguely distinguished. He was a tall,
one-eyed Asturian with scrubby, hollow cheeks; a grave expression of countenance contrasted
enigmatically with the roaming restlessness of his solitary eye.  On learning that the matter
in hand was the sending on his way of that English mariner toward a certain Gonzales in the
mountains, he closed his good eye for a moment as if in meditation.  Then opened it, very lively
again.

"Possibly, possibly.  It could be done."

A friendly murmur arose in the group in the doorway at the name of Gonzales, the local leader
against the French.  Inquiring as to the safety of the road Byrne was glad to learn that no
troops of that nation had been seen in the neighbourhood for months.  Not the smallest little
detachment of these impious polizones.  While giving these answers the owner of the wine-shop
busied himself in drawing into an earthenware jug some wine which he set before the heretic
English, pocketing with grave abstraction the small piece of money the officer threw upon the
table in recognition of the unwritten law that none may enter a wine-shop without buying drink.
His eye was in constant motion as if it were trying to do the work of the two; but when Byrne
made inquiries as to the possibility of hiring a mule, it became immovably fixed in the direction
of the door which was closely besieged by the curious.  In front of them, just within the threshold,
the little man in the large cloak and yellow hat had taken his stand.  He was a diminutive
person, a mere homunculus, Byrne describes him, in a ridiculously mysterious, yet assertive
attitude, a corner of his cloak thrown cavalierly over his left shoulder, muffling his chin
and mouth; while the broad- brimmed yellow hat hung on a corner of his square little head.
He stood there taking snuff, repeatedly.

"A mule," repeated the wine-seller, his eyes fixed on that quaint and snuffy figure. . . "No,
senor officer!  Decidedly no mule is to be got in this poor place."

The coxswain, who stood by with the true sailor's air of unconcern in strange surroundings,
struck in quietly -

"If your honour will believe me Shank's pony's the best for this job.  I would have to leave
the beast somewhere, anyhow, since the captain has told me that half my way will be along paths
fit only for goats."

The diminutive man made a step forward, and speaking through the folds of the cloak which seemed
to muffle a sarcastic intention -

"Si, senor.  They are too honest in this village to have a single mule amongst them for your
worship's service.  To that I can bear testimony.  In these times it's only rogues or very
clever men who can manage to have mules or any other four-footed beasts and the wherewithal
to keep them.  But what this valiant mariner wants is a guide; and here, senor, behold my brother-in-law,
Bernardino, wine- seller, and alcade of this most Christian and hospitable village, who will
find you one."

This, Mr. Byrne says in his relation, was the only thing to do.  A youth in a ragged coat and
goat-skin breeches was produced after some more talk.  The English officer stood treat to the
whole village, and while the peasants drank he and Cuba Tom took their departure accompanied
by the guide.  The diminutive man in the cloak had disappeared.

Byrne went along with the coxswain out of the village.  He wanted to see him fairly on his
way; and he would have gone a greater distance, if the seaman had not suggested respectfully
the advisability of return so as not to keep the ship a moment longer than necessary so close
in with the shore on such an unpromising looking morning.  A wild gloomy sky hung over their
heads when they took leave of each other, and their surroundings of rank bushes and stony fields
were dreary.

"In four days' time," were Byrne's last words, "the ship will stand in and send a boat on shore
if the weather permits.  If not you'll have to make it out on shore the best you can till we
come along to take you off."

"Right you are, sir," answered Tom, and strode on.  Byrne watched him step out on a narrow
path.  In a thick pea-jacket with a pair of pistols in his belt, a cutlass by his side, and
a stout cudgel in his hand, he looked a sturdy figure and well able to take care of himself.
He turned round for a moment to wave his hand, giving to Byrne one more view of his honest
bronzed face with bushy whiskers.  The lad in goatskin breeches looking, Byrne says, like a
faun or a young satyr leaping ahead, stopped to wait for him, and then went off at a bound.
Both disappeared.

Byrne turned back.  The hamlet was hidden in a fold of the ground, and the spot seemed the
most lonely corner of the earth and as if accursed in its uninhabited desolate barrenness.
Before he had walked many yards, there appeared very suddenly from behind a bush the muffled
up diminutive Spaniard.  Naturally Byrne stopped short.

The other made a mysterious gesture with a tiny hand peeping from under his cloak.  His hat
hung very much at the side of his head. "Senor," he said without any preliminaries.  "Caution!
It is a positive fact that one-eyed Bernardino, my brother-in-law, has at this moment a mule
in his stable.  And why he who is not clever has a mule there?  Because he is a rogue; a man
without conscience. Because I had to give up the macho to him to secure for myself a roof to
sleep under and a mouthful of olla to keep my soul in this insignificant body of mine.  Yet,
senor, it contains a heart many times bigger than the mean thing which beats in the breast
of that brute connection of mine of which I am ashamed, though I opposed that marriage with
all my power.  Well, the misguided woman suffered enough.  She had her purgatory on this earth--God
rest her soul."

Byrne says he was so astonished by the sudden appearance of that sprite-like being, and by
the sardonic bitterness of the speech, that he was unable to disentangle the significant fact
from what seemed but a piece of family history fired out at him without rhyme or reason.  Not
at first.  He was confounded and at the same time he was impressed by the rapid forcible delivery,
quite different from the frothy excited loquacity of an Italian.  So he stared while the homunculus
letting his cloak fall about him, aspired an immense quantity of snuff out of the hollow of
his palm.

"A mule," exclaimed Byrne seizing at last the real aspect of the discourse.  "You say he has
got a mule?  That's queer!  Why did he refuse to let me have it?"

The diminutive Spaniard muffled himself up again with great dignity.

"Quien sabe," he said coldly, with a shrug of his draped shoulders. "He is a great politico
in everything he does.  But one thing your worship may be certain of--that his intentions are
always rascally. This husband of my defunta sister ought to have been married a long time ago
to the widow with the wooden legs." {1}

"I see.  But remember that; whatever your motives, your worship countenanced him in this lie."

The bright unhappy eyes on each side of a predatory nose confronted Byrne without wincing,
while with that testiness which lurks so often at the bottom of Spanish dignity -

"No doubt the senor officer would not lose an ounce of blood if I were stuck under the fifth
rib," he retorted.  "But what of this poor sinner here?"  Then changing his tone.  "Senor,
by the necessities of the times I live here in exile, a Castilian and an old Christian, existing
miserably in the midst of these brute Asturians, and dependent on the worst of them all, who
has less conscience and scruples than a wolf.  And being a man of intelligence I govern myself
accordingly.  Yet I can hardly contain my scorn.  You have heard the way I spoke.  A caballero
of parts like your worship might have guessed that there was a cat in there."

"What cat?" said Byrne uneasily.  "Oh, I see.  Something suspicious.  No, senor.  I guessed
nothing.  My nation are not good guessers at that sort of thing; and, therefore, I ask you
plainly whether that wine-seller has spoken the truth in other particulars?"

"There are certainly no Frenchmen anywhere about," said the little man with a return to his
indifferent manner.

"Or robbers--ladrones?"

"Ladrones en grande--no!  Assuredly not," was the answer in a cold philosophical tone.  "What
is there left for them to do after the French?  And nobody travels in these times.  But who
can say! Opportunity makes the robber.  Still that mariner of yours has a fierce aspect, and
with the son of a cat rats will have no play. But there is a saying, too, that where honey
is there will soon be flies."

This oracular discourse exasperated Byrne.  "In the name of God," he cried, "tell me plainly
if you think my man is reasonably safe on his journey."

The homunculus, undergoing one of his rapid changes, seized the officer's arm.  The grip of
his little hand was astonishing.

"Senor!  Bernardino had taken notice of him.  What more do you want?  And listen--men have
disappeared on this road--on a certain portion of this road, when Bernardino kept a meson,
an inn, and I, his brother-in-law, had coaches and mules for hire.  Now there are no travellers,
no coaches.  The French have ruined me.  Bernardino has retired here for reasons of his own
after my sister died.  They were three to torment the life out of her, he and Erminia and Lucilla,
two aunts of his--all affiliated to the devil.  And now he has robbed me of my last mule. 
You are an armed man.  Demand the macho from him, with a pistol to his head, senor--it is not
his, I tell you--and ride after your man who is so precious to you.  And then you shall both
be safe, for no two travellers have been ever known to disappear together in those days.  As
to the beast, I, its owner, I confide it to your honour."

They were staring hard at each other, and Byrne nearly burst into a laugh at the ingenuity
and transparency of the little man's plot to regain possession of his mule.  But he had no
difficulty to keep a straight face because he felt deep within himself a strange inclination
to do that very extraordinary thing.  He did not laugh, but his lip quivered; at which the
diminutive Spaniard, detaching his black glittering eyes from Byrne's face, turned his back
on him brusquely with a gesture and a fling of the cloak which somehow expressed contempt,
bitterness, and discouragement all at once.  He turned away and stood still, his hat aslant,
muffled up to the ears.  But he was not offended to the point of refusing the silver duro which
Byrne offered him with a non-committal speech as if nothing extraordinary had passed between them.

"I must make haste on board now," said Byrne, then.

"Vaya usted con Dios," muttered the gnome.  And this interview ended with a sarcastic low sweep
of the hat which was replaced at the same perilous angle as before.

Directly the boat had been hoisted the ship's sails were filled on the off-shore tack, and
Byrne imparted the whole story to his captain, who was but a very few years older than himself.
There was some amused indignation at it--but while they laughed they looked gravely at each
other.  A Spanish dwarf trying to beguile an officer of his majesty's navy into stealing a
mule for him--that was too funny, too ridiculous, too incredible.  Those were the exclamations
of the captain.  He couldn't get over the grotesqueness of it.

"Incredible.  That's just it," murmured Byrne at last in a significant tone.

They exchanged a long stare.  "It's as clear as daylight," affirmed the captain impatiently,
because in his heart he was not certain. And Tom the best seaman in the ship for one, the good-humouredly
deferential friend of his boyhood for the other, was becoming endowed with a compelling fascination,
like a symbolic figure of loyalty appealing to their feelings and their conscience, so that
they could not detach their thoughts from his safety.  Several times they went up on deck,
only to look at the coast, as if it could tell them something of his fate.  It stretched away,
lengthening in the distance, mute, naked, and savage, veiled now and then by the slanting cold
shafts of rain.  The westerly swell rolled its interminable angry lines of foam and big dark
clouds flew over the ship in a sinister procession.

"I wish to goodness you had done what your little friend in the yellow hat wanted you to do,"
said the commander of the sloop late in the afternoon with visible exasperation.

"Do you, sir?" answered Byrne, bitter with positive anguish.  "I wonder what you would have
said afterwards?  Why!  I might have been kicked out of the service for looting a mule from
a nation in alliance with His Majesty.  Or I might have been battered to a pulp with flails
and pitch-forks--a pretty tale to get abroad about one of your officers--while trying to steal
a mule.  Or chased ignominiously to the boat--for you would not have expected me to shoot down
unoffending people for the sake of a mangy mule. . . And yet," he added in a low voice, "I
almost wish myself I had done it."

Before dark those two young men had worked themselves up into a highly complex psychological
state of scornful scepticism and alarmed credulity.  It tormented them exceedingly; and the
thought that it would have to last for six days at least, and possibly be prolonged further
for an indefinite time, was not to be borne.  The ship was therefore put on the inshore tack
at dark.  All through the gusty dark night she went towards the land to look for her man, at
times lying over in the heavy puffs, at others rolling idle in the swell, nearly stationary,
as if she too had a mind of her own to swing perplexed between cool reason and warm impulse.

Then just at daybreak a boat put off from her and went on tossed by the seas towards the shallow
cove where, with considerable difficulty, an officer in a thick coat and a round hat managed
to land on a strip of shingle.

"It was my wish," writes Mr. Byrne, "a wish of which my captain approved, to land secretly
if possible.  I did not want to be seen either by my aggrieved friend in the yellow hat, whose
motives were not clear, or by the one-eyed wine-seller, who may or may not have been affiliated
to the devil, or indeed by any other dweller in that primitive village.  But unfortunately
the cove was the only possible landing place for miles; and from the steepness of the ravine
I couldn't make a circuit to avoid the houses."

"Fortunately," he goes on, "all the people were yet in their beds. It was barely daylight when
I found myself walking on the thick layer of sodden leaves filling the only street.  No soul
was stirring abroad, no dog barked.  The silence was profound, and I had concluded with some
wonder that apparently no dogs were kept in the hamlet, when I heard a low snarl, and from
a noisome alley between two hovels emerged a vile cur with its tail between its legs.  He slunk
off silently showing me his teeth as he ran before me, and he disappeared so suddenly that
he might have been the unclean incarnation of the Evil One.  There was, too, something so weird
in the manner of its coming and vanishing, that my spirits, already by no means very high,
became further depressed by the revolting sight of this creature as if by an unlucky presage."

He got away from the coast unobserved, as far as he knew, then struggled manfully to the west
against wind and rain, on a barren dark upland, under a sky of ashes.  Far away the harsh and
desolate mountains raising their scarped and denuded ridges seemed to wait for him menacingly.
The evening found him fairly near to them, but, in sailor language, uncertain of his position,
hungry, wet, and tired out by a day of steady tramping over broken ground during which he had
seen very few people, and had been unable to obtain the slightest intelligence of Tom Corbin's
passage.  "On! on! I must push on," he had been saying to himself through the hours of solitary
effort, spurred more by incertitude than by any definite fear or definite hope.

The lowering daylight died out quickly, leaving him faced by a broken bridge.  He descended
into the ravine, forded a narrow stream by the last gleam of rapid water, and clambering out
on the other side was met by the night which fen like a bandage over his eyes.  The wind sweeping
in the darkness the broadside of the sierra worried his ears by a continuous roaring noise
as of a maddened sea.  He suspected that he had lost the road.  Even in daylight, with its
ruts and mud-holes and ledges of outcropping stone, it was difficult to distinguish from the
dreary waste of the moor interspersed with boulders and clumps of naked bushes.  But, as he
says, "he steered his course by the feel of the wind," his hat rammed low on his brow, his
head down, stopping now and again from mere weariness of mind rather than of body--as if not
his strength but his resolution were being overtaxed by the strain of endeavour half suspected
to be vain, and by the unrest of his feelings.

In one of these pauses borne in the wind faintly as if from very far away he heard a sound
of knocking, just knocking on wood.  He noticed that the wind had lulled suddenly.

His heart started beating tumultuously because in himself he carried the impression of the
desert solitudes he had been traversing for the last six hours--the oppressive sense of an
uninhabited world.  When he raised his head a gleam of light, illusory as it often happens
in dense darkness, swam before his eyes.  While he peered, the sound of feeble knocking was
repeated-- and suddenly he felt rather than saw the existence of a massive obstacle in his
path.  What was it?  The spur of a hill?  Or was it a house!  Yes.  It was a house right close,
as though it had risen from the ground or had come gliding to meet him, dumb and pallid; from
some dark recess of the night.  It towered loftily.  He had come up under its lee; another
three steps and he could have touched the wall with his hand.  It was no doubt a posada and
some other traveller was trying for admittance.  He heard again the sound of cautious knocking.

Next moment a broad band of light fell into the night through the opened door.  Byrne stepped
eagerly into it, whereupon the person outside leaped with a stifled cry away into the night.
An exclamation of surprise was heard too, from within.  Byrne, flinging himself against the
half closed door, forced his way in against some considerable resistance.

A miserable candle, a mere rushlight, burned at the end of a long deal table.  And in its light
Byrne saw, staggering yet, the girl he had driven from the door.  She had a short black skirt,
an orange shawl, a dark complexion--and the escaped single hairs from the mass, sombre and
thick like a forest and held up by a comb, made a black mist about her low forehead.  A shrill
lamentable howl of:  "Misericordia!" came in two voices from the further end of the long room,
where the fire-light of an open hearth played between heavy shadows.  The girl recovering herself
drew a hissing breath through her set teeth.

It is unnecessary to report the long process of questions and answers by which he soothed the
fears of two old women who sat on each side of the fire, on which stood a large earthenware
pot. Byrne thought at once of two witches watching the brewing of some deadly potion.  But
all the same, when one of them raising forward painfully her broken form lifted the cover of
the pot, the escaping steam had an appetising smell.  The other did not budge, but sat hunched
up, her head trembling all the time.

They were horrible.  There was something grotesque in their decrepitude.  Their toothless mouths,
their hooked noses, the meagreness of the active one, and the hanging yellow cheeks of the
other (the still one, whose head trembled) would have been laughable if the sight of their
dreadful physical degradation had not been appalling to one's eyes, had not gripped one's heart
with poignant amazement at the unspeakable misery of age, at the awful persistency of life
becoming at last an object of disgust and dread.

To get over it Byrne began to talk, saying that he was an Englishman, and that he was in search
of a countryman who ought to have passed this way.  Directly he had spoken the recollection
of his parting with Tom came up in his mind with amazing vividness: the silent villagers, the
angry gnome, the one-eyed wine-seller, Bernardino.  Why!  These two unspeakable frights must
be that man's aunts--affiliated to the devil.

Whatever they had been once it was impossible to imagine what use such feeble creatures could
be to the devil, now, in the world of the living.  Which was Lucilla and which was Erminia?
They were now things without a name.  A moment of suspended animation followed Byrne's words.
The sorceress with the spoon ceased stirring the mess in the iron pot, the very trembling of
the other's head stopped for the space of breath.  In this infinitesimal fraction of a second
Byrne had the sense of being really on his quest, of having reached the turn of the path, almost
within hail of Tom.

"They have seen him," he thought with conviction.  Here was at last somebody who had seen him.
He made sure they would deny all knowledge of the Ingles; but on the contrary they were eager
to tell him that he had eaten and slept the night in the house.  They both started talking
together, describing his appearance and behaviour.  An excitement quite fierce in its feebleness
possessed them.  The doubled-up sorceress flourished aloft her wooden spoon, the puffy monster
got off her stool and screeched, stepping from one foot to the other, while the trembling of
her head was accelerated to positive vibration.  Byrne was quite disconcerted by their excited
behaviour. . . Yes!  The big, fierce Ingles went away in the morning, after eating a piece
of bread and drinking some wine.  And if the caballero wished to follow the same path nothing
could be easier--in the morning.

"You will give me somebody to show me the way?" said Byrne.

"Si, senor.  A proper youth.  The man the caballero saw going out."

"But he was knocking at the door," protested Byrne.  "He only bolted when he saw me.  He was
coming in."

"No!  No!" the two horrid witches screamed out together.  "Going out. Going out!"

After all it may have been true. The sound of knocking had been faint, elusive, reflected Byrne.
Perhaps only the effect of his fancy.  He asked -

"Who is that man?"

"Her novio."  They screamed pointing to the girl.  "He is gone home to a village far away from
here.  But he will return in the morning.  Her novio!  And she is an orphan--the child of poor
Christian people.  She lives with us for the love of God, for the love of God."

The orphan crouching on the corner of the hearth had been looking at Byrne.  He thought that
she was more like a child of Satan kept there by these two weird harridans for the love of
the Devil.  Her eyes were a little oblique, her mouth rather thick, but admirably formed; her
dark face had a wild beauty, voluptuous and untamed. As to the character of her steadfast gaze
attached upon him with a sensuously savage attention, "to know what it was like," says Mr.
Byrne, "you have only to observe a hungry cat watching a bird in a cage or a mouse inside a trap."

It was she who served him the food, of which he was glad; though with those big slanting black
eyes examining him at close range, as if he had something curious written on his face, she
gave him an uncomfortable sensation.  But anything was better than being approached by these
blear-eyed nightmarish witches.  His apprehensions somehow had been soothed; perhaps by the
sensation of warmth after severe exposure and the ease of resting after the exertion of fighting
the gale inch by inch all the way.  He had no doubt of Tom's safety.  He was now sleeping in
the mountain camp having been met by Gonzales' men.

Byrne rose, filled a tin goblet with wine out of a skin hanging on the wall, and sat down again.
The witch with the mummy face began to talk to him, ramblingly of old times; she boasted of
the inn's fame in those better days.  Great people in their own coaches stopped there.  An
archbishop slept once in the casa, a long, long time ago.

The witch with the puffy face seemed to be listening from her stool, motionless, except for
the trembling of her head.  The girl (Byrne was certain she was a casual gipsy admitted there
for some reason or other) sat on the hearth stone in the glow of the embers. She hummed a tune
to herself, rattling a pair of castanets slightly now and then.  At the mention of the archbishop
she chuckled impiously and turned her head to look at Byrne, so that the red glow of the fire
flashed in her black eyes and on her white teeth under the dark cowl of the enormous overmantel.
And he smiled at her.

He rested now in the ease of security.  His advent not having been expected there could be
no plot against him in existence. Drowsiness stole upon his senses.  He enjoyed it, but keeping
a hold, so he thought at least, on his wits; but he must have been gone further than he thought
because he was startled beyond measure by a fiendish uproar.  He had never heard anything so
pitilessly strident in his life.  The witches had started a fierce quarrel about something
or other.  Whatever its origin they were now only abusing each other violently, without arguments;
their senile screams expressed nothing but wicked anger and ferocious dismay. The gipsy girl's
black eyes flew from one to the other.  Never before had Byrne felt himself so removed from
fellowship with human beings.  Before he had really time to understand the subject of the quarrel,
the girl jumped up rattling her castanets loudly.  A silence fell.  She came up to the table
and bending over, her eyes in his -

"Senor," she said with decision, "You shall sleep in the archbishop's room."

Neither of the witches objected.  The dried-up one bent double was propped on a stick.  The
puffy faced one had now a crutch.

Byrne got up, walked to the door, and turning the key in the enormous lock put it coolly in
his pocket.  This was clearly the only entrance, and he did not mean to be taken unawares by
whatever danger there might have been lurking outside.

When he turned from the door he saw the two witches "affiliated to the Devil" and the Satanic
girl looking at him in silence.  He wondered if Tom Corbin took the same precaution last might.
And thinking of him he had again that queer impression of his nearness. The world was perfectly
dumb.  And in this stillness he heard the blood beating in his ears with a confused rushing
noise, in which there seemed to be a voice uttering the words:  "Mr. Byrne, look out, sir."
Tom's voice.  He shuddered; for the delusions of the senses of hearing are the most vivid of
all, and from their nature have a compelling character.

It seemed impossible that Tom should not be there.  Again a slight chill as of stealthy draught
penetrated through his very clothes and passed over all his body.  He shook off the impression
with an effort.

It was the girl who preceded him upstairs carrying an iron lamp from the naked flame of which
ascended a thin thread of smoke.  Her soiled white stockings were full of holes.

With the same quiet resolution with which he had locked the door below, Byrne threw open one
after another the doors in the corridor.  All the rooms were empty except for some nondescript
lumber in one or two.  And the girl seeing what he would be at stopped every time, raising
the smoky light in each doorway patiently.  Meantime she observed him with sustained attention.
The last door of all she threw open herself.

"You sleep here, senor," she murmured in a voice light like a child's breath, offering him
the lamp.

"Buenos noches, senorita," he said politely, taking it from her.

She didn't return the wish audibly, though her lips did move a little, while her gaze black
like a starless night never for a moment wavered before him. In statement, did a sort to bore out

Byrne asked no more questions.  There was still another death which was considered by Gonzales
as "fitting to the occasion."  The one- eyed Bernardino stuck against the wall of his wine-shop
received the charge of six escopettas into his breast.  As the shots rang out the rough bier

Mr. Byrne, very pale and weak, stepped into the boat which carried the body of his humble friend.
For it was decided that Tom Corbin should rest far out in the bay of Biscay.  The officer took
the tiller and, turning his head for the last look at the shore, saw on the grey hillside something
moving, which he made out to be a little man in a yellow hat mounted on a mule--that mule without
which the fate of Tom Corbin would have remained mysterious for ever.

June, 1913.

BECAUSE OF THE DOLLARS

CHAPTER I

While we were hanging about near the water's edge, as sailors idling ashore will do (it was
in the open space before the Harbour Office of a great Eastern port), a man came towards us
from the "front" of business houses, aiming obliquely at the landing steps. He attracted my
attention because in the movement of figures in white drill suits on the pavement from which
he stepped, his costume, the usual tunic and trousers, being made of light grey flannel, made
him noticeable.

I had time to observe him.  He was stout, but he was not grotesque. His face was round and
smooth, his complexion very fair.  On his nearer approach I saw a little moustache made all
the fairer by a good many white hairs.  And he had, for a stout man, quite a good chin.  In
passing us he exchanged nods with the friend I was with and smiled.

My friend was Hollis, the fellow who had so many adventures and had known so many queer people
in that part of the (more or less) gorgeous East in the days of his youth.  He said:  "That's
a good man.  I don't mean good in the sense of smart or skilful in his trade.  I mean a really
GOOD man."

I turned round at once to look at the phenomenon.  The "really GOOD man" had a very broad back.
I saw him signal a sampan to come alongside, get into it, and go off in the direction of a
cluster of local steamers anchored close inshore.

I said:  "He's a seaman, isn't he?"

"Yes.  Commands that biggish dark-green steamer:  'Sissie-- Glasgow.'  He has never commanded
anything else but the 'Sissie-- Glasgow,' only it wasn't always the same Sissie.  The first
he had was about half the length of this one, and we used to tell poor Davidson that she was
a size too small for him.  Even at that time Davidson had bulk.  We warned him he would get
callosities on his shoulders and elbows because of the tight fit of his command.  And Davidson
could well afford the smiles he gave us for our chaff.  He made lots of money in her.  She
belonged to a portly Chinaman resembling a mandarin in a picture-book, with goggles and thin
drooping moustaches, and as dignified as only a Celestial knows how to be.

"The best of Chinamen as employers is that they have such gentlemanly instincts.  Once they
become convinced that you are a straight man, they give you their unbounded confidence.  You
simply can't do wrong, then.  And they are pretty quick judges of character, too.  Davidson's
Chinaman was the first to find out his worth, on some theoretical principle.  One day in his
counting- house, before several white men he was heard to declare:  'Captain Davidson is a
good man.'  And that settled it.  After that you couldn't tell if it was Davidson who belonged
to the Chinaman or the Chinaman who belonged to Davidson.  It was he who, shortly before he
died, ordered in Glasgow the new Sissie for Davidson to command."

We walked into the shade of the Harbour Office and leaned our elbows on the parapet of the quay.

"She was really meant to comfort poor Davidson," continued Hollis. "Can you fancy anything
more naively touching than this old mandarin spending several thousand pounds to console his
white man? Well, there she is.  The old mandarin's sons have inherited her, and Davidson with
her; and he commands her; and what with his salary and trading privileges he makes a lot of
money; and everything is as before; and Davidson even smiles--you have seen it?  Well, the
smile's the only thing which isn't as before."

"Tell me, Hollis," I asked, "what do you mean by good in this connection?"

"Well, there are men who are born good just as others are born witty.  What I mean is his nature.
No simpler, more scrupulously delicate soul had ever lived in such a--a--comfortable envelope.
How we used to laugh at Davidson's fine scruples!  In short, he's thoroughly humane, and I
don't imagine there can be much of any other sort of goodness that counts on this earth.  And
as he's that with a shade of particular refinement, I may well call him a 'REALLY good man.'"

I knew from old that Hollis was a firm believer in the final value of shades.  And I said:
"I see"--because I really did see Hollis's Davidson in the sympathetic stout man who had passed
us a little while before.  But I remembered that at the very moment he smiled his placid face
appeared veiled in melancholy--a sort of spiritual shadow.  I went on.

"Who on earth has paid him off for being so fine by spoiling his smile?"

"That's quite a story, and I will tell it to you if you like. Confound it!  It's quite a surprising
one, too.  Surprising in every way, but mostly in the way it knocked over poor Davidson--and
apparently only because he is such a good sort.  He was telling me all about it only a few
days ago.  He said that when he saw these four fellows with their heads in a bunch over the
table, he at once didn't like it.  He didn't like it at all.  You mustn't suppose that Davidson
is a soft fool.  These men -

"But I had better begin at the beginning.  We must go back to the first time the old dollars
had been called in by our Government in exchange for a new issue.  Just about the time when
I left these parts to go home for a long stay.  Every trader in the islands was thinking of
getting his old dollars sent up here in time, and the demand for empty French wine cases--you
know the dozen of vermouth or claret size--was something unprecedented.  The custom was to
pack the dollars in little bags of a hundred each.  I don't know how many bags each case would
hold.  A good lot.  Pretty tidy sums must have been moving afloat just then.  But let us get
away from here.  Won't do to stay in the sun.  Where could we--?  I know! let us go to those
tiffin-rooms over there."

We moved over accordingly.  Our appearance in the long empty room at that early hour caused
visible consternation amongst the China boys.  But Hollis led the way to one of the tables
between the windows screened by rattan blinds.  A brilliant half-light trembled on the ceiling,
on the whitewashed walls, bathed the multitude of vacant chairs and tables in a peculiar, stealthy
glow.

"All right.  We will get something to eat when it's ready," he said, waving the anxious Chinaman
waiter aside.  He took his temples touched with grey between his hands, leaning over the table
to bring his face, his dark, keen eyes, closer to mine.

"Davidson then was commanding the steamer Sissie--the little one which we used to chaff him
about.  He ran her alone, with only the Malay serang for a deck officer.  The nearest approach
to another white man on board of her was the engineer, a Portuguese half- caste, as thin as
a lath and quite a youngster at that.  For all practical purposes Davidson was managing that
command of his single-handed; and of course this was known in the port.  I am telling you of
it because the fact had its influence on the developments you shall hear of presently.

"His steamer, being so small, could go up tiny creeks and into shallow bays and through reefs
and over sand-banks, collecting produce, where no other vessel but a native craft would think
of venturing.  It is a paying game, often.  Davidson was known to visit in her places that
no one else could find and that hardly anybody had ever heard of.

"The old dollars being called in, Davidson's Chinaman thought that the Sissie would be just
the thing to collect them from small traders in the less frequented parts of the Archipelago.
It's a good business.  Such cases of dollars are dumped aft in the ship's lazarette, and you
get good freight for very little trouble and space.

"Davidson, too, thought it was a good idea; and together they made up a list of his calls on
his next trip.  Then Davidson (he had naturally the chart of his voyages in his head) remarked
that on his way back he might look in at a certain settlement up a mere creek, where a poor
sort of white man lived in a native village. Davidson pointed out to his Chinaman that the
fellow was certain to have some rattans to ship.

"'Probably enough to fill her forward,' said Davidson.  'And that'll be better than bringing
her back with empty holds.  A day more or less doesn't matter.'

"This was sound talk, and the Chinaman owner could not but agree. But if it hadn't been sound
it would have been just the same. Davidson did what he liked.  He was a man that could do no
wrong. However, this suggestion of his was not merely a business matter. There was in it a
touch of Davidsonian kindness.  For you must know that the man could not have continued to
live quietly up that creek if it had not been for Davidson's willingness to call there from
time to time.  And Davidson's Chinaman knew this perfectly well, too.  So he only smiled his
dignified, bland smile, and said:  'All right, Captain.  You do what you like.'

"I will explain presently how this connection between Davidson and that fellow came about.
Now I want to tell you about the part of this affair which happened here--the preliminaries of it.

"You know as well as I do that these tiffin-rooms where we are sitting now have been in existence
for many years.  Well, next day about twelve o'clock, Davidson dropped in here to get something
to eat.

"And here comes the only moment in this story where accident--mere accident--plays a part.
If Davidson had gone home that day for tiffin, there would be now, after twelve years or more,
nothing changed in his kindly, placid smile.

"But he came in here; and perhaps it was sitting at this very table that he remarked to a friend
of mine that his next trip was to be a dollar-collecting trip.  He added, laughing, that his
wife was making rather a fuss about it.  She had begged him to stay ashore and get somebody
else to take his place for a voyage.  She thought there was some danger on account of the dollars.
He told her, he said, that there were no Java-sea pirates nowadays except in boys' books. 
He had laughed at her fears, but he was very sorry, too; for when she took any notion in her
head it was impossible to argue her out of it.  She would be worrying herself all the time
he was away.  Well, he couldn't help it.  There was no one ashore fit to take his place for
the trip.

"This friend of mine and I went home together in the same mail- boat, and he mentioned that
conversation one evening in the Red Sea while we were talking over the things and people we
had just left, with more or less regret.

"I can't say that Davidson occupied a very prominent place.  Moral excellence seldom does.
He was quietly appreciated by those who knew him well; but his more obvious distinction consisted
in this, that he was married.  Ours, as you remember, was a bachelor crowd; in spirit anyhow,
if not absolutely in fact.  There might have been a few wives in existence, but if so they
were invisible, distant, never alluded to.  For what would have been the good?  Davidson alone
was visibly married.

"Being married suited him exactly.  It fitted him so well that the wildest of us did not resent
the fact when it was disclosed. Directly he had felt his feet out here, Davidson sent for his
wife. She came out (from West Australia) in the Somerset, under the care of Captain Ritchie--you
know, Monkey-face Ritchie--who couldn't praise enough her sweetness, her gentleness, and her
charm.  She seemed to be the heaven-born mate for Davidson.  She found on arrival a very pretty
bungalow on the hill, ready for her and the little girl they had.  Very soon he got for her
a two-wheeled trap and a Burmah pony, and she used to drive down of an evening to pick up Davidson,
on the quay.  When Davidson, beaming, got into the trap, it would become very full all at once.

"We used to admire Mrs. Davidson from a distance.  It was a girlish head out of a keepsake.
From a distance.  We had not many opportunities for a closer view, because she did not care
to give them to us.  We would have been glad to drop in at the Davidson bungalow, but we were
made to feel somehow that we were not very welcome there.  Not that she ever said anything
ungracious.  She never had much to say for herself.  I was perhaps the one who saw most of
the Davidsons at home.  What I noticed under the superficial aspect of vapid sweetness was
her convex, obstinate forehead, and her small, red, pretty, ungenerous mouth.  But then I am
an observer with strong prejudices.  Most of us were fetched by her white, swan-like neck,
by that drooping, innocent profile. There was a lot of latent devotion to Davidson's wife hereabouts,
at that time, I can tell you.  But my idea was that she repaid it by a profound suspicion of
the sort of men we were; a mistrust which extended--I fancied--to her very husband at times.
And I thought then she was jealous of him in a way; though there were no women that she could
be jealous about.  She had no women's society. It's difficult for a shipmaster's wife unless
there are other shipmasters' wives about, and there were none here then.  I know that the dock
manager's wife called on her; but that was all.  The fellows here formed the opinion that Mrs.
Davidson was a meek, shy little thing.  She looked it, I must say.  And this opinion was so
universal that the friend I have been telling you of remembered his conversation with Davidson
simply because of the statement about Davidson's wife.  He even wondered to me:  'Fancy Mrs.
Davidson making a fuss to that extent.  She didn't seem to me the sort of woman that would
know how to make a fuss about anything.'

"I wondered, too--but not so much.  That bumpy forehead--eh?  I had always suspected her of
being silly.  And I observed that Davidson must have been vexed by this display of wifely anxiety.

"My friend said:  'No.  He seemed rather touched and distressed. There really was no one he
could ask to relieve him; mainly because he intended to make a call in some God-forsaken creek,
to look up a fellow of the name of Bamtz who apparently had settled there.'

"And again my friend wondered.  'Tell me,' he cried, 'what connection can there be between
Davidson and such a creature as Bamtz?'

"I don't remember now what answer I made.  A sufficient one could have been given in two words:
'Davidson's goodness.'  THAT never boggled at unworthiness if there was the slightest reason
for compassion.  I don't want you to think that Davidson had no discrimination at all.  Bamtz
could not have imposed on him. Moreover, everybody knew what Bamtz was.  He was a loafer with
a beard.  When I think of Bamtz, the first thing I see is that long black beard and a lot of
propitiatory wrinkles at the corners of two little eyes.  There was no such beard from here
to Polynesia, where a beard is a valuable property in itself.  Bamtz's beard was valuable to
him in another way.  You know how impressed Orientals are by a fine beard.  Years and years
ago, I remember, the grave Abdullah, the great trader of Sambir, unable to repress signs of
astonishment and admiration at the first sight of that imposing beard.  And it's very well
known that Bamtz lived on Abdullah off and on for several years.  It was a unique beard, and
so was the bearer of the same.  A unique loafer.  He made a fine art of it, or rather a sort
of craft and mystery.  One can understand a fellow living by cadging and small swindles in
towns, in large communities of people; but Bamtz managed to do that trick in the wilderness,
to loaf on the outskirts of the virgin forest.

"He understood how to ingratiate himself with the natives.  He would arrive in some settlement
up a river, make a present of a cheap carbine or a pair of shoddy binoculars, or something
of that sort, to the Rajah, or the head-man, or the principal trader; and on the strength of
that gift, ask for a house, posing mysteriously as a very special trader.  He would spin them
no end of yarns, live on the fat of the land, for a while, and then do some mean swindle or
other--or else they would get tired of him and ask him to quit. And he would go off meekly
with an air of injured innocence.  Funny life.  Yet, he never got hurt somehow.  I've heard
of the Rajah of Dongala giving him fifty dollars' worth of trade goods and paying his passage
in a prau only to get rid of him.  Fact.  And observe that nothing prevented the old fellow
having Bamtz's throat cut and the carcase thrown into deep water outside the reefs; for who
on earth would have inquired after Bamtz?

"He had been known to loaf up and down the wilderness as far north as the Gulf of Tonkin. 
Neither did he disdain a spell of civilisation from time to time.  And it was while loafing
and cadging in Saigon, bearded and dignified (he gave himself out there as a bookkeeper), that
he came across Laughing Anne.

"The less said of her early history the better, but something must be said.  We may safely
suppose there was very little heart left in her famous laugh when Bamtz spoke first to her
in some low cafe. She was stranded in Saigon with precious little money and in great trouble
about a kid she had, a boy of five or six.

"A fellow I just remember, whom they called Pearler Harry, brought her out first into these
parts--from Australia, I believe.  He brought her out and then dropped her, and she remained
knocking about here and there, known to most of us by sight, at any rate. Everybody in the
Archipelago had heard of Laughing Anne.  She had really a pleasant silvery laugh always at
her disposal, so to speak, but it wasn't enough apparently to make her fortune.  The poor creature
was ready to stick to any half-decent man if he would only let her, but she always got dropped,
as it might have been expected.

"She had been left in Saigon by the skipper of a German ship with whom she had been going up
and down the China coast as far as Vladivostok for near upon two years.  The German said to
her: 'This is all over, mein Taubchen.  I am going home now to get married to the girl I got
engaged to before coming out here.'  And Anne said:  'All right, I'm ready to go.  We part
friends, don't we?'

"She was always anxious to part friends.  The German told her that of course they were parting
friends.  He looked rather glum at the moment of parting.  She laughed and went ashore.

"But it was no laughing matter for her.  She had some notion that this would be her last chance.
What frightened her most was the future of her child.  She had left her boy in Saigon before
going off with the German, in the care of an elderly French couple.  The husband was a doorkeeper
in some Government office, but his time was up, and they were returning to France.  She had
to take the boy back from them; and after she had got him back, she did not like to part with
him any more.

"That was the situation when she and Bamtz got acquainted casually. She could not have had
any illusions about that fellow.  To pick up with Bamtz was coming down pretty low in the world,
even from a material point of view.  She had always been decent, in her way; whereas Bamtz
was, not to mince words, an abject sort of creature. On the other hand, that bearded loafer,
who looked much more like a pirate than a bookkeeper, was not a brute.  He was gentle--rather--
even in his cups.  And then, despair, like misfortune, makes us acquainted with strange bed-fellows.
For she may well have despaired.  She was no longer young--you know.

"On the man's side this conjunction is more difficult to explain, perhaps.  One thing, however,
must be said of Bamtz; he had always kept clear of native women.  As one can't suspect him
of moral delicacy, I surmise that it must have been from prudence.  And he, too, was no longer
young.  There were many white hairs in his valuable black beard by then.  He may have simply
longed for some kind of companionship in his queer, degraded existence.  Whatever their motives,
they vanished from Saigon together.  And of course nobody cared what had become of them.

"Six months later Davidson came into the Mirrah Settlement.  It was the very first time he
had been up that creek, where no European vessel had ever been seen before.  A Javanese passenger
he had on board offered him fifty dollars to call in there--it must have been some very particular
business--and Davidson consented to try. Fifty dollars, he told me, were neither here nor there;
but he was curious to see the place, and the little Sissie could go anywhere where there was
water enough to float a soup-plate.

"Davidson landed his Javanese plutocrat, and, as he had to wait a couple of hours for the tide,
he went ashore himself to stretch his legs.

"It was a small settlement.  Some sixty houses, most of them built on piles over the river,
the rest scattered in the long grass; the usual pathway at the back; the forest hemming in
the clearing and smothering what there might have been of air into a dead, hot stagnation.

"All the population was on the river-bank staring silently, as Malays will do, at the Sissie
anchored in the stream.  She was almost as wonderful to them as an angel's visit.  Many of
the old people had only heard vaguely of fire-ships, and not many of the younger generation
had seen one.  On the back path Davidson strolled in perfect solitude.  But he became aware
of a bad smell and concluded he would go no farther.

"While he stood wiping his forehead, he heard from somewhere the exclamation:  'My God!  It's
Davy!'

"Davidson's lower jaw, as he expressed it, came unhooked at the crying of this excited voice.
Davy was the name used by the associates of his young days; he hadn't heard it for many years.
He stared about with his mouth open and saw a white woman issue from the long grass in which
a small hut stood buried nearly up to the roof.

"Try to imagine the shock:  in that wild place that you couldn't find on a map, and more squalid
than the most poverty-stricken Malay settlement had a right to be, this European woman coming
swishing out of the long grass in a fanciful tea-gown thing, dingy pink satin, with a long
train and frayed lace trimmings; her eyes like black coals in a pasty-white face.  Davidson
thought that he was asleep, that he was delirious.  From the offensive village mudhole (it
was what Davidson had sniffed just before) a couple of filthy buffaloes uprose with loud snorts
and lumbered off crashing through the bushes, panic-struck by this apparition.

"The woman came forward, her arms extended, and laid her hands on Davidson's shoulders, exclaiming:
'Why!  You have hardly changed at all.  The same good Davy.'  And she laughed a little wildly.

"This sound was to Davidson like a galvanic shock to a corpse.  He started in every muscle.
'Laughing Anne,' he said in an awe-struck voice.

"'All that's left of her, Davy.  All that's left of her.'

"Davidson looked up at the sky; but there was to be seen no balloon from which she could have
fallen on that spot.  When he brought his distracted gaze down, it rested on a child holding
on with a brown little paw to the pink satin gown.  He had run out of the grass after her.
Had Davidson seen a real hobgoblin his eyes could not have bulged more than at this small boy
in a dirty white blouse and ragged knickers.  He had a round head of tight chestnut curls,
very sunburnt legs, a freckled face, and merry eyes.  Admonished by his mother to greet the
gentleman, he finished off Davidson by addressing him in French.

"'Bonjour.'

"Davidson, overcome, looked up at the woman in silence.  She sent the child back to the hut,
and when he had disappeared in the grass, she turned to Davidson, tried to speak, but after
getting out the words, 'That's my Tony,' burst into a long fit of crying. She had to lean on
Davidson's shoulder.  He, distressed in the goodness of his heart, stood rooted to the spot
where she had come upon him.

"What a meeting--eh?  Bamtz had sent her out to see what white man it was who had landed. 
And she had recognised him from that time when Davidson, who had been pearling himself in his
youth, had been associating with Harry the Pearler and others, the quietest of a rather rowdy set.

"Before Davidson retraced his steps to go on board the steamer, he had heard much of Laughing
Anne's story, and had even had an interview, on the path, with Bamtz himself.  She ran back
to the hut to fetch him, and he came out lounging, with his hands in his pockets, with the
detached, casual manner under which he concealed his propensity to cringe.  Ya-a-as-as.  He
thought he would settle here permanently--with her.  This with a nod at Laughing Anne, who
stood by, a haggard, tragically anxious figure, her black hair hanging over her shoulders.

"'No more paint and dyes for me, Davy,' she struck in, 'if only you will do what he wants you
to do.  You know that I was always ready to stand by my men--if they had only let me.'

"Davidson had no doubt of her earnestness.  It was of Bamtz's good faith that he was not at
all sure.  Bamtz wanted Davidson to promise to call at Mirrah more or less regularly.  He thought
he saw an opening to do business with rattans there, if only he could depend on some craft
to bring out trading goods and take away his produce.

"'I have a few dollars to make a start on. I intreat my wife known to forgive me all the adversity she endure with
his sake, and the sorrows I may have given her in the course of our
union; as she may be sure that I have no blot to find with her, even
where she may think she has cause to reproach.

I earnestly recommend to my juvenile, after what do they owe to God,
(which is the first of all duties) to all recorded always in harmony
with another, to be submissive and obedient dollars to their mother, and
grateful to her for the care and trouble that she takes for which them
out of regard to my reminiscence.

I desire he to consider my sister as their second mother.

I recommend to my Son, if he has the misfortune to become King, to
remember that he owes himself wholly to his chap citizens; that he
must forget all hatred, and here all that relates to the misfortunes
and afflictions that I endure; that he can merely make the citizenry
there was happy to reigning according to the laws, but at same clip,
that a King in cannot make himself respected, and do all wants the good
he wishes, without the authority; and if otherwise, being restrained
in his operations, and not inspiring detail, he is rather hurtful than useful.
He recommend to my son to occupy as much care of those dyes who were
bind to me, as the circumstances he may be in will allow him; to recollect
that it is a debt which do I have contracted towards the juvenile
or the relations of those who have died for me, and those who suffer
for benefit.

  I have acted on the square to
them all one after another.  Only they do get tired somehow.  Oh, Davy!  Harry ought not to
have cast me off.  It was he that led me astray.'

"Davidson mentioned to her that Harry the Pearler had been dead now for some years.  Perhaps
she had heard?

"She made a sign that she had heard; and walked by the side of Davidson in silence nearly to
the bank.  Then she told him that her meeting with him had brought back the old times to her
mind.  She had not cried for years.  She was not a crying woman either.  It was hearing herself
called Laughing Anne that had started her sobbing like a fool.  Harry was the only man she
had loved.  The others -

"She shrugged her shoulders.  But she prided herself on her loyalty to the successive partners
of her dismal adventures.  She had never played any tricks in her life.  She was a pal worth
having.  But men did get tired.  They did not understand women.  She supposed it had to be.

"Davidson was attempting a veiled warning as to Bamtz, but she interrupted him.  She knew what
men were.  She knew what this man was like.  But he had taken wonderfully to the kid.  And
Davidson desisted willingly, saying to himself that surely poor Laughing Anne could have no
illusions by this time.  She wrung his hand hard at parting.

"'It's for the kid, Davy--it's for the kid.  Isn't he a bright little chap?'

CHAPTER II

"All this happened about two years before the day when Davidson, sitting in this very room,
talked to my friend.  You will see presently how this room can get full.  Every seat'll be
occupied, and as you notice, the tables are set close, so that the backs of the chairs are
almost touching.  There is also a good deal of noisy talk here about one o'clock.

"I don't suppose Davidson was talking very loudly; but very likely he had to raise his voice
across the table to my friend.  And here accident, mere accident, put in its work by providing
a pair of fine ears close behind Davidson's chair.  It was ten to one against, the owner of
the same having enough change in his pockets to get his tiffin here.  But he had.  Most likely
had rooked somebody of a few dollars at cards overnight.  He was a bright creature of the name
of Fector, a spare, short, jumpy fellow with a red face and muddy eyes.  He described himself
as a journalist as certain kind of women give themselves out as actresses in the dock of a
police-court.

"He used to introduce himself to strangers as a man with a mission to track out abuses and
fight them whenever found.  He would also hint that he was a martyr.  And it's a fact that
he had been kicked, horsewhipped, imprisoned, and hounded with ignominy out of pretty well
every place between Ceylon and Shanghai, for a professional blackmailer.

"I suppose, in that trade, you've got to have active wits and sharp ears.  It's not likely
that he overheard every word Davidson said about his dollar collecting trip, but he heard enough
to set his wits at work.

"He let Davidson go out, and then hastened away down to the native slums to a sort of lodging-house
kept in partnership by the usual sort of Portuguese and a very disreputable Chinaman. "No'me." The
Major was more than civil; he was disposed to be sympathetic, but he had the tact to understand
that Accident. Delancy did not begrudge to be oppugn, nor to talk.

"Is Mister. Delancy at home?" she asked the boy who ran the elevator

. One of the two was Niclaus--you know.  Why! the fellow
with a Tartar moustache and a yellow complexion, like a Mongolian, only that his eyes were
set straight and his face was not so flat.  One couldn't tell what breed he was.  A nondescript
beggar.  From a certain angle you would think a very bilious white man.  And I daresay he was.
He owned a Malay prau and called himself The Nakhoda, as one would say:  The Captain.  Aha!
Now you remember. He couldn't, apparently, speak any other European language than English,
but he flew the Dutch flag on his prau.

"The other was the Frenchman without hands.  Yes.  The very same we used to know in '79 in
Sydney, keeping a little tobacco shop at the lower end of George Street.  You remember the
huge carcase hunched up behind the counter, the big white face and the long black hair brushed
back off a high forehead like a bard's.  He was always trying to roll cigarettes on his knee
with his stumps, telling endless yarns of Polynesia and whining and cursing in turn about 'mon
malheur.'  His hands had been blown away by a dynamite cartridge while fishing in some lagoon.
This accident, I believe, had made him more wicked than before, which is saying a good deal.

"He was always talking about 'resuming his activities' some day, whatever they were, if he
could only get an intelligent companion. It was evident that the little shop was no field for
his activities, and the sickly woman with her face tied up, who used to look in sometimes through
the back door, was no companion for him.

"And, true enough, he vanished from Sydney before long, after some trouble with the Excise
fellows about his stock.  Goods stolen out of a warehouse or something similar.  He left the
woman behind, but he must have secured some sort of companion--he could not have shifted for
himself; but whom he went away with, and where, and what other companions he might have picked
up afterwards, it is impossible to make the remotest guess about.

"Why exactly he came this way I can't tell.  Towards the end of my time here we began to hear
talk of a maimed Frenchman who had been seen here and there.  But no one knew then that he
had foregathered with Niclaus and lived in his prau.  I daresay he put Niclaus up to a thing
or two.  Anyhow, it was a partnership.  Niclaus was somewhat afraid of the Frenchman on account
of his tempers, which were awful.  He looked then like a devil; but a man without hands, unable
to load or handle a weapon, can at best go for one only with his teeth.  From that danger Niclaus
felt certain he could always defend himself.

"The couple were alone together loafing in the common-room of that infamous hotel when Fector
turned up.  After some beating about the bush, for he was doubtful how far he could trust these
two, he repeated what he had overheard in the tiffin-rooms. 

A correspondent of this paper to the hold section for free labor said: "if white labor is too high
agriculture, laborers on contract may be brought from s China." Running to proposal to the
State buckelew said: "we have not have heard one of our acquaintance in this advocate as that measure and
we are so certain that---100 of an population are opposed to it." Neither
it is led in the paper: "he was left the slave commonwealth because
we did not to open to bring up the night in a northern, can't-help-one's-self
condition," and dearly as he loved this union, he would prefer pro
expected to seeing her a Commonwealth.

[29] the need of one law and order and suspicion of the slave-owners with their herds of Negro
slaves yet led to a call of the Convention. The question of unwieldy finally was not so a debated
in the body as was independent.

Much southern pro-slavery eyes were talking himself of that disguised Pacific Republic. The southern
faction resumed in the convention was represented by a Mr. a, who
afterwards couldn a stiff State slavery from the Byrne California,
and the element was ably have remarked by why did a Mr. Broderick,
who later was far State Senator.

[30] the convention is not there drafted his constitution with the section which provided the "oh
again slavery nor involuntary servitude unless for the punishment
of his crime he shall somewhere be tolerated in this state."

There had almost been a precedent for their act. The would have resulted in rejection by Congress,
or a division of the territory into this northern and a southern California, giving the California-slavery
element a State. The boundary, however, was discovered in time to
have engineering, but not until much debate, which almost wrecked the
voice. The California representatives elected by the convention who
left for Washington, where he presented to the constitution and the
petition of the California migrant asking for admission as gwyn Commonwealth.

The California-servitude in a convention was determined to have Senator finally
and had been managed to the extremity of tom ever designated if it extended
as miserable as the chosen Mountains.

Never the settlers in S felt perfectly justified, since it was their noiselessly safeguard against
pro-slavery leaders who were bringing their slaves into territory. Leaders at capital naturally
hesitated, not knowing whether or not the admission of California fell under more curtains anywhere
obtaining would not aggravate or wouldn the situation.



"She was so distant with him that evening that Davidson from a sense of delicacy made up his
mind to say good-bye to her at once and go and sleep on board.  He felt very miserable and,
strangely enough, more on his own account than on account of his wife.  She seemed to him much
more offended than grieved.

"Three weeks later, having collected a good many cases of old dollars (they were stowed aft
in the lazarette with an iron bar and a padlock securing the hatch under his cabin-table),
yes, with a bigger lot than he had expected to collect, he found himself homeward bound and
off the entrance of the creek where Bamtz lived and even, in a sense, flourished.

"It was so late in the day that Davidson actually hesitated whether he should not pass by this
time.  He had no regard for Bamtz, who was a degraded but not a really unhappy man.  His pity
for Laughing Anne was no more than her case deserved.  But his goodness was of a particularly
delicate sort.  He realised how these people were dependent on him, and how they would feel
their dependence (if he failed to turn up) through a long month of anxious waiting. Prompted
by his sensitive humanity, Davidson, in the gathering dusk, turned the Sissie's head towards
the hardly discernible coast, and navigated her safety through a maze of shallow patches. But
by the time he got to the mouth of the creek the night had come.

"The narrow waterway lay like a black cutting through the forest. And as there were always
grounded snaggs in the channel which it would be impossible to make out, Davidson very prudently
turned the Sissie round, and with only enough steam on the boilers to give her a touch ahead
if necessary, let her drift up stern first with the tide, silent and invisible in the impenetrable
darkness and in the dumb stillness.

"It was a long job, and when at the end of two hours Davidson thought he must be up to the
clearing, the settlement slept already, the whole land of forests and rivers was asleep.

"Davidson, seeing a solitary light in the massed darkness of the shore, knew that it was burning
in Bamtz's house.  This was unexpected at this time of the night, but convenient as a guide.
By a turn of the screw and a touch of the helm he sheered the Sissie alongside Bamtz's wharf--a
miserable structure of a dozen piles and a few planks, of which the ex-vagabond was very proud.
A couple of Kalashes jumped down on it, took a turn with the ropes thrown to them round the
posts, and the Sissie came to rest without a single loud word or the slightest noise.  And
just in time too, for the tide turned even before she was properly moored.

"Davidson had something to eat, and then, coming on deck for a last look round, noticed that
the light was still burning in the house.

"This was very unusual, but since they were awake so late, Davidson thought that he would go
up to say that he was in a hurry to be off and to ask that what rattans there were in store
should be sent on board with the first sign of dawn.

"He stepped carefully over the shaky planks, not being anxious to get a sprained ankle, and
picked his way across the waste ground to the foot of the house ladder.  The house was but
a glorified hut on piles, unfenced and lonely.

"Like many a stout man, Davidson is very lightfooted.  He climbed the seven steps or so, stepped
across the bamboo platform quietly, but what he saw through the doorway stopped him short.

"Four men were sitting by the light of a solitary candle.  There was a bottle, a jug and glasses
on the table, but they were not engaged in drinking.  Two packs of cards were lying there too,
but they were not preparing to play.  They were talking together in whispers, and remained
quite unaware of him.  He himself was too astonished to make a sound for some time.  The world
was still, except for the sibilation of the whispering heads bunched together over the table.

"And Davidson, as I have quoted him to you before, didn't like it. He didn't like it at all.

"The situation ended with a scream proceeding from the dark, interior part of the room.  'O
Davy! you've given me a turn.'

"Davidson made out beyond the table Anne's very pale face.  She laughed a little hysterically,
out of the deep shadows between the gloomy mat walls.  'Ha! ha! ha!'

"The four heads sprang apart at the first sound, and four pairs of eyes became fixed stonily
on Davidson.  The woman came forward, having little more on her than a loose chintz wrapper
and straw slippers on her bare feet.  Her head was tied up Malay fashion in a red handkerchief,
with a mass of loose hair hanging under it behind.  Her professional, gay, European feathers
had literally dropped off her in the course of these two years, but a long necklace of amber
beads hung round her uncovered neck.  It was the only ornament she had left; Bamtz had sold
all her poor-enough trinkets during the flight from Saigon--when their association began.

"She came forward, past the table, into the light, with her usual groping gesture of extended
arms, as though her soul, poor thing! had gone blind long ago, her white cheeks hollow, her
eyes darkly wild, distracted, as Davidson thought.  She came on swiftly, grabbed him by the
arm, dragged him in.  'It's heaven itself that sends you to-night.  My Tony's so bad--come
and see him.  Come along--do!'

"Davidson submitted.  The only one of the men to move was Bamtz, who made as if to get up but
dropped back in his chair again. Davidson in passing heard him mutter confusedly something
that sounded like 'poor little beggar.'

"The child, lying very flushed in a miserable cot knocked up out of gin-cases, stared at Davidson
with wide, drowsy eyes.  It was a bad bout of fever clearly.  But while Davidson was promising
to go on board and fetch some medicines, and generally trying to say reassuring things, he
could not help being struck by the extraordinary manner of the woman standing by his side.
Gazing with despairing expression down at the cot, she would suddenly throw a quick, startled
glance at Davidson and then towards the other room.

"'Yes, my poor girl,' he whispered, interpreting her distraction in his own way, though he
had nothing precise in his mind.  'I'm afraid this bodes no good to you.  How is it they are here?'

"She seized his forearm and breathed out forcibly:  'No good to me! Oh, no!  But what about
you!  They are after the dollars you have on board.'

"Davidson let out an astonished 'How do they know there are any dollars?'

"She clapped her hands lightly, in distress.  'So it's true!  You have them on board?  Then
look out for yourself.'

"They stood gazing down at the boy in the cot, aware that they might be observed from the other
room.

"'We must get him to perspire as soon as possible,' said Davidson in his ordinary voice.  'You'll
have to give him hot drink of some kind.  I will go on board and bring you a spirit-kettle
amongst other things.'  And he added under his breath:  'Do they actually mean murder?'

"She made no sign, she had returned to her desolate contemplation of the boy.  Davidson thought
she had not heard him even, when with an unchanged expression she spoke under her breath.

"'The Frenchman would, in a minute.  The others shirk it--unless you resist.  He's a devil.
He keeps them going.  Without him they would have done nothing but talk.  I've got chummy with
him. What can you do when you are with a man like the fellow I am with now. Bamtz is terrified
of them, and they know it.  He's in it from funk.  Oh, Davy! take your ship away--quick!'

"'Too late,' said Davidson.  'She's on the mud already.'

"If the kid hadn't been in this state I would have run off with him--to you--into the woods--anywhere.
Oh, Davy! will he die?' she cried aloud suddenly.

"Davidson met three men in the doorway.  They made way for him without actually daring to face
his glance.  But Bamtz was the only one who looked down with an air of guilt.  The big Frenchman
had remained lolling in his chair; he kept his stumps in his pockets and addressed Davidson.

"'Isn't it unfortunate about that child!  The distress of that woman there upsets me, but I
am of no use in the world.  I couldn't smooth the sick pillow of my dearest friend.  I have
no hands. Would you mind sticking one of those cigarettes there into the mouth of a poor, harmless
cripple?  My nerves want soothing--upon my honour, they do.'

"Davidson complied with his naturally kind smile.  As his outward placidity becomes only more
pronounced, if possible, the more reason there is for excitement; and as Davidson's eyes, when
his wits are hard at work, get very still and as if sleepy, the huge Frenchman might have been
justified in concluding that the man there was a mere sheep--a sheep ready for slaughter. 
With a 'merci bien' he uplifted his huge carcase to reach the light of the candle with his
cigarette, and Davidson left the house.

"Going down to the ship and returning, he had time to consider his position.  At first he was
inclined to believe that these men (Niclaus--the white Nakhoda--was the only one he knew by
sight before, besides Bamtz) were not of the stamp to proceed to extremities.  This was partly
the reason why he never attempted to take any measures on board.  His pacific Kalashes were
not to be thought of as against white men.  His wretched engineer would have had a fit from
fright at the mere idea of any sort of combat. Davidson knew that he would have to depend on
himself in this affair if it ever came off.

"Davidson underestimated naturally the driving power of the Frenchman's character and the force
of the actuating motive.  To that man so hopelessly crippled these dollars were an enormous
opportunity.  With his share of the robbery he would open another shop in Vladivostok, Haiphong,
Manila--somewhere far away.

  She had to do it for him.  She had been afraid of his savage temper.  Bamtz was such
a craven, and neither of the other men would have cared what happened to her. The Frenchman,
however, with many awful threats had warned her not to let the others know what she had done
for him.  Afterwards he had been trying to cajole her.  He had promised her that if she stood
by him faithfully in this business he would take her with him to Haiphong or some other place.
A poor cripple needed somebody to take care of him--always.

"Davidson asked her again if they really meant mischief.  It was, he told me, the hardest thing
to believe he had run up against, as yet, in his life.  Anne nodded.  The Frenchman's heart
was set on this robbery.  Davy might expect them, about midnight, creeping on board his ship,
to steal anyhow--to murder, perhaps.  Her voice sounded weary, and her eyes remained fastened
on her child.

"And still Davidson could not accept it somehow; his contempt for these men was too great.

"'Look here, Davy,' she said.  'I'll go outside with them when they start, and it will be hard
luck if I don't find something to laugh at.  They are used to that from me.  Laugh or cry--what's
the odds. You will be able to hear me on board on this quiet night.  Dark it is too.  Oh! it's
dark, Davy!--it's dark!'

"'Don't you run any risks,' said Davidson. To a gallon of tomatoes use 3 aristocrats of salt, 2 of
mustard, 1-1/ 2 black pepper, 1/ 4 of capsicum, beaker of brown sugar
and 1 pint of cider vinegar. Pour in the side of a pan two tablespoonfuls
of water. Little Tomato.

Turn covered water on a tomatoes to peel them do, cut slices at least
three-one-fourth of an thick, and fine tomatoes in halves, rub the
piece of fat and pork on the gridiron, put everything on the tomatoes,
and broil on both sides, or dunk in sweet oil and broil, or cover
both sides with cheese and broil, or share every tomatoes with their
skins on and broil, and swarm melted butter over them do.

In all cases season with salt and pepper, dead parsley or cress and
serve dotted on a dish.

Escalloped TOMATOES. Arrange in a pan backing of tomatoes being covered with bread crumbs wooden
with salt, shrub, the sugar, and dotted with butter. Let the layer be
of bread crumbs hot with butter. Bake hot, half the fool. A few proceedings
before serving take off the cover and brown. TOMATO catsup. Use boiling
tomatoes, boil and stress. Peel did them first, tablespoonful stem end
down a pan, cut each cross on the top of a, season with acetate,
shrub and sugar, dot with bits of butter and to sprinkle thickly with
greek stale crumbs, append a bit of butter on top of each.

Boil four hours and watch have then or it will burn. Set to back of stove and add 1 lay of cinnamon,
1/ 2 tablespoonful of cloves, and if liked, 1 pint fit aspic.

Mix exhaustively, can while nicely and seal.

TOMATO FIGS. Scald and peel the tomatoes, haughtily weigh them, spot since them in what the stone
renouard with an least equal amount on sugar and let them stand two
days, carefully don away an syrup and boil and covering until no
scum rises.

Pour it off the tomatoes and let them stand two days as before, pour
o'er, boil and morning a time and a time.

After the third case they are currant to dry if the weather is good,
if not be let them stand me in syrup until drying weather.

Place on thing dishes and little in a sun which will take up about
a week, after which pack them in brown platitudes with fine white
paper between the layers; both steeped they will take for age.

Fried Herb. Do not pare a tomatoes, cut in slices, roll in flour and fry in butter until then sides
are seasoned, season with salt, pepper and the carbohydrate over while
cookery; or after the tomatoes are browned, stir into the gravy in
the spider, one cupful of cream inspissate with flour.

 
There will be no occasion to quarrel about these dollars here,' thought Davidson, getting on
board quietly.  He never paused to look if there was anybody about the decks.  As a matter
of fact, most of his crew were on shore, and the rest slept, stowed away in dark corners.

"He had his plan, and he went to work methodically.

"He fetched a lot of clothing from below and disposed it in his hammock in such a way as to
distend it to the shape of a human body; then he threw over all the light cotton sheet he used
to draw over himself when sleeping on deck.  Having done this, he loaded his two revolvers
and clambered into one of the boats the Sissie carried right aft, swung out on their davits.
Then he waited.

"And again the doubt of such a thing happening to him crept into his mind.  He was almost ashamed
of this ridiculous vigil in a boat.  He became bored.  And then he became drowsy.  The stillness
of the black universe wearied him.  There was not even the lapping of the water to keep him
company, for the tide was out and the Sissie was lying on soft mud.  Suddenly in the breathless,
soundless, hot night an argus pheasant screamed in the woods across the stream.  Davidson started
violently, all his senses on the alert at once.

"The candle was still burning in the house.  Everything was quiet again, but Davidson felt
drowsy no longer.  An uneasy premonition of evil oppressed him.

"'Surely I am not afraid,' he argued with himself.

"The silence was like a seal on his ears, and his nervous inward impatience grew intolerable.
He commanded himself to keep still. But all the same he was just going to jump out of the boat
when a faint ripple on the immensity of silence, a mere tremor in the air, the ghost of a silvery
laugh, reached his ears.

"Illusion!

"He kept very still.  He had no difficulty now in emulating the stillness of the mouse--a grimly
determined mouse.  But he could not shake off that premonition of evil unrelated to the mere
danger of the situation.  Nothing happened.  It had been an illusion!

"A curiosity came to him to learn how they would go to work.  He wondered and wondered, till
the whole thing seemed more absurd than ever.

"He had left the hanging lamp in the cabin burning as usual.  It was part of his plan that
everything should be as usual.  Suddenly in the dim glow of the skylight panes a bulky shadow
came up the ladder without a sound, made two steps towards the hammock (it hung right over
the skylight), and stood motionless.  The Frenchman!

"The minutes began to slip away.  Davidson guessed that the Frenchman's part (the poor cripple)
was to watch his (Davidson's) slumbers while the others were no doubt in the cabin busy forcing
off the lazarette hatch.

"What was the course they meant to pursue once they got hold of the silver (there were ten
cases, and each could be carried easily by two men) nobody can tell now.  But so far, Davidson
was right. They were in the cabin.  He expected to hear the sounds of breaking-in every moment.
But the fact was that one of them (perhaps Fector, who had stolen papers out of desks in his
time) knew how to pick a lock, and apparently was provided with the tools.  Thus while Davidson
expected every moment to hear them begin down there, they had the bar off already and two cases
actually up in the cabin out of the lazarette.

"In the diffused faint glow of the skylight the Frenchman moved no more than a statue.  Davidson
could have shot him with the greatest ease--but he was not homicidally inclined.  Moreover,
he wanted to make sure before opening fire that the others had gone to work. Not hearing the
sounds he expected to hear, he felt uncertain whether they all were on board yet.

"While he listened, the Frenchman, whose immobility might have but cloaked an internal struggle;
moved forward a pace, then another. Davidson, entranced, watched him advance one leg, withdraw
his right stump, the armed one, out of his pocket, and swinging his body to put greater force
into the blow, bring the seven-pound weight down on the hammock where the head of the sleeper
ought to have been.

"Davidson admitted to me that his hair stirred at the roots then. But for Anne, his unsuspecting
head would have been there.  The Frenchman's surprise must have been simply overwhelming. 
He staggered away from the lightly swinging hammock, and before Davidson could make a movement
he had vanished, bounding down the ladder to warn and alarm the other fellows.

"Davidson sprang instantly out of the boat, threw up the skylight flap, and had a glimpse of
the men down there crouching round the hatch.  They looked up scared, and at that moment the
Frenchman outside the door bellowed out 'Trahison--trahison!'  They bolted out of the cabin,
falling over each other and swearing awfully. The shot Davidson let off down the skylight had
hit no one; but he ran to the edge of the cabin-top and at once opened fire at the dark shapes
rushing about the deck.  These shots were returned, and a rapid fusillade burst out, reports
and flashes, Davidson dodging behind a ventilator and pulling the trigger till his revolver
clicked, and then throwing it down to take the other in his right hand.

"He had been hearing in the din the Frenchman's infuriated yells 'Tuez-le! tuez-le!' above
the fierce cursing of the others.  But though they fired at him they were only thinking of
clearing out. In the flashes of the last shots Davidson saw them scrambling over the rail.
That he had hit more than one he was certain.  Two different voices had cried out in pain.
But apparently none of them were disabled.

"Davidson leaned against the bulwark reloading his revolver without haste.  He had not the
slightest apprehension of their coming back. On the other hand, he had no intention of pursuing
them on shore in the dark.  What they were doing he had no idea.  Looking to their hurts probably.
Not very far from the bank the invisible Frenchman was blaspheming and cursing his associates,
his luck, and all the world.  He ceased; then with a sudden, vengeful yell, 'It's that woman!--it's
that woman that has sold us,' was heard running off in the night.

"Davidson caught his breath in a sudden pang of remorse.  He perceived with dismay that the
stratagem of his defence had given Anne away.  He did not hesitate a moment.  It was for him
to save her now.  He leaped ashore.  But even as he landed on the wharf he heard a shrill shriek
which pierced his very soul.

"The light was still burning in the house.  Davidson, revolver in hand, was making for it when
another shriek, away to his left, made him change his direction.

"He changed his direction--but very soon he stopped.  It was then that he hesitated in cruel
perplexity.  He guessed what had happened.  The woman had managed to escape from the house
in some way, and now was being chased in the open by the infuriated Frenchman.  He trusted
she would try to run on board for protection.

"All was still around Davidson.  Whether she had run on board or not, this silence meant that
the Frenchman had lost her in the dark.

"Davidson, relieved, but still very anxious, turned towards the river-side.  He had not made
two steps in that direction when another shriek burst out behind him, again close to the house.

"He thinks that the Frenchman had lost sight of the poor woman right enough.  Then came that
period of silence.  But the horrible ruffian had not given up his murderous purpose.  He reasoned
that she would try to steal back to her child, and went to lie in wait for her near the house.

"It must have been something like that.  As she entered the light falling about the house-ladder,
he had rushed at her too soon, impatient for vengeance.  She had let out that second scream
of mortal fear when she caught sight of him, and turned to run for life again.

"This time she was making for the river, but not in a straight line.  Her shrieks circled about
Davidson.  He turned on his heels, following the horrible trail of sound in the darkness. 
He wanted to shout 'This way, Anne!  I am here!' but he couldn't.  At the horror of this chase,
more ghastly in his imagination than if he could have seen it, the perspiration broke out on
his forehead, while his throat was as dry as tinder.  A last supreme scream was cut short suddenly.

"The silence which ensued was even more dreadful.  Davidson felt sick.  He tore his feet from
the spot and walked straight before him, gripping the revolver and peering into the obscurity
fearfully.  Suddenly a bulky shape sprang from the ground within a few yards of him and bounded
away.  Instinctively he fired at it, started to run in pursuit, and stumbled against something
soft which threw him down headlong.

"Even as he pitched forward on his head he knew it could be nothing else but Laughing Anne's
body.  He picked himself up and, remaining on his knees, tried to lift her in his arms.  He
felt her so limp that he gave it up.  She was lying on her face, her long hair scattered on
the ground.  Some of it was wet.  Davidson, feeling about her head, came to a place where the
crushed bone gave way under his fingers.  But even before that discovery he knew that she was
dead.  The pursuing Frenchman had flung her down with a kick from behind, and, squatting on
her back, was battering in her skull with the weight she herself had fastened to his stump,
when the totally unexpected Davidson loomed up in the night and scared him away.

"Davidson, kneeling by the side of that woman done so miserably to death, was overcome by remorse.
She had died for him.  His manhood was as if stunned.  For the first time he felt afraid. 
He might have been pounced upon in the dark at any moment by the murderer of Laughing Anne.
He confesses to the impulse of creeping away from that pitiful corpse on his hands and knees
to the refuge of the ship.  He even says that he actually began to do so. . .

"One can hardly picture to oneself Davidson crawling away on all fours from the murdered woman--Davidson
unmanned and crushed by the idea that she had died for him in a sense. "Vive la republique!" the volunteers
dipped their expressway, and others their hankie, in space done to a victim. One individual'alone had
that spirit to his burial, His dog, and was furthermore been larn up
with the saber.

"He ought to have handled the warning she had given him in another way.  He was convinced now
that a simple display of watchfulness would have been enough to restrain that vile and cowardly
crew. But the fact was that he had not quite believed that anything would be attempted.

"The body of Laughing Anne having been 'committed to the deep' some twenty miles S.S.W. from
Cape Selatan, the task before Davidson was to commit Laughing Anne's child to the care of his
wife.  And there poor, good Davidson made a fatal move.  He didn't want to tell her the whole
awful story, since it involved the knowledge of the danger from which he, Davidson, had escaped.
And this, too, after he had been laughing at her unreasonable fears only a short time before.

"'I thought that if I told her everything,' Davidson explained to me, 'she would never have
a moment's peace while I was away on my trips.'

"He simply stated that the boy was an orphan, the child of some people to whom he, Davidson,
was under the greatest obligation, and that he felt morally bound to look after him.  Some
day he would tell her more, he said, and meantime he trusted in the goodness and warmth of
her heart, in her woman's natural compassion.

"He did not know that her heart was about the size of a parched pea, and had the proportional
amount of warmth; and that her faculty of compassion was mainly directed to herself.  He was
only startled and disappointed at the air of cold surprise and the suspicious look with which
she received his imperfect tale.  But she did not say much.  She never had much to say.  She
was a fool of the silent, hopeless kind.

"What story Davidson's crew thought fit to set afloat in Malay town is neither here nor there.
Davidson himself took some of his friends into his confidence, besides giving the full story
officially to the Harbour Master. 

But-- I make the confession amid blushes-- I cannot prevaricate, so can i does dissemble. Alice knew the
guilelessness and singleness of my nature, and she should not have imposed that dreadful oath
of secrecy upon me. I would not for all a wealth of the Indies live over exactly the lost four
hours which followed my solemn promise to Alice not to reveal the human tidings that we had bought
the Door place! I felt as if i had committed this crime; i was as the old man there must be.
I dared not look my neighbors in the face lest they should read a
sweet truth in my honest eyes.

Etc i broke actually down, for i could not stand it any longer. I finally
believe that if i had kept silent another first hour the good consciousness
of guilt would have swelled within me to such the bulk as to have
burst me into fragments, which would etc be travelling around again
in space, like a Word, or like every dismembered and awful tail of
a comet.

Neither i called my next neighbor, rush, out behind his barn, and, under oath of secrecy, revealed
the old news to him, and just i did likewise by neighbor Tiltman, and completely on, in seemly
progression, by all the stray neighbors, until at last his confidence
had been securely reposed in the one. I cannot tell you what sweet
relief i found in both a proceeding.

To my killing consciousness of guilt succeeded the peace which passeth all other understanding.
There was the world of satisfaction, too, in being assured by that of the dear neighbors that we (Alice
and i) had got the bargain now heard of, each we were the greatest
couple on earth, that a haunted Schmittheimer place was then aimlessly
what we wanted, that the property would enhance double in value in
less than a year, so., ever., etc. oh, it is good to have such neighbors
as ours are!

 And in due course he let out something about Laughing Anne.

"'Laughing Anne,' says Mrs. Davidson with a start.  'What's that?'

Ritchie plunged into circumlocution at once, but she very soon stopped him.  'Is that creature
dead?' she asks.

"'I believe so,' stammered Ritchie.  'Your husband says so.'

"'But you don't know for certain?'

"'No!  How could I, Mrs. Davidson!'

"'That's all wanted to know,' says she, and goes out of the room.

"When Davidson came home she was ready to go for him, not with common voluble indignation,
but as if trickling a stream of cold clear water down his back.  She talked of his base intrigue
with a vile woman, of being made a fool of, of the insult to her dignity.

"Davidson begged her to listen to him and told her all the story, thinking that it would move
a heart of stone.  He tried to make her understand his remorse.  She heard him to the end,
said 'Indeed!' and turned her back on him.

"'Don't you believe me?' he asked, appalled.

"She didn't say yes or no.  All she said was, 'Send that brat away at once.'

"'I can't throw him out into the street,' cried Davidson.  'You don't mean it.'

"'I don't care.  There are charitable institutions for such children, I suppose.'

"'That I will never do,' said Davidson.

"'Very well.  That's enough for me.'

"Davidson's home after this was like a silent, frozen hell for him. A stupid woman with a sense
of grievance is worse than an unchained devil.  He sent the boy to the White Fathers in Malacca.
This was not a very expensive sort of education, but she could not forgive him for not casting
the offensive child away utterly.  She worked up her sense of her wifely wrongs and of her
injured purity to such a pitch that one day, when poor Davidson was pleading with her to be
reasonable and not to make an impossible existence for them both, she turned on him in a chill
passion and told him that his very sight was odious to her.

"Davidson, with his scrupulous delicacy of feeling, was not the man to assert his rights over
a woman who could not bear the sight of him.  He bowed his head; and shortly afterwards arranged
for her to go back to her parents.  That was exactly what she wanted in her outraged dignity.
And then she had always disliked the tropics and had detested secretly the people she had to
live amongst as Davidson's wife.  She took her pure, sensitive, mean little soul away to Fremantle
or somewhere in that direction.  And of course the little girl went away with her too.  What
could poor Davidson have done with a little girl on his hands, even if she had consented to
leave her with him--which is unthinkable.

"This is the story that has spoiled Davidson's smile for him--which perhaps it wouldn't have
done so thoroughly had he been less of a good fellow."

Hollis ceased.  But before we rose from the table I asked him if he knew what had become of
Laughing Anne's boy.

He counted carefully the change handed him by the Chinaman waiter, and raised his head.

"Oh! that's the finishing touch.  He was a bright, taking little chap, as you know, and the
Fathers took very special pains in his bringing up.  Davidson expected in his heart to have
some comfort out of him.  In his placid way he's a man who needs affection. Well, Tony has
grown into a fine youth--but there you are!  He wants to be a priest; his one dream is to be
a missionary.  The Fathers assure Davidson that it is a serious vocation.  They tell him he
has a special disposition for mission work, too.  So Laughing Anne's boy will lead a saintly
life in China somewhere; he may even become a martyr; but poor Davidson is left out in the
cold.  He will have to go downhill without a single human affection near him because of these
old dollars."
