Reduced by despair to make almost any attempt, and fascinated, in spite of himself, by the
diabolical hints of Faringhea, Djalma looked for a second full at Mdlle. de Cardoville; then,
with a trembling hand he took the bouquet from Rose-Pompon, and, again looking at Adrienne,
pressed it to his lips.

Upon this insolent bravado, Mdlle. de Cardoville could not restrain so sudden and visible a
pang, that the prince was struck by it.

"She is yours," said the half-caste, to him. "Did you see, my lord, how she trembled with jealousy?--Only
have courage! and she is yours. She will soon prefer you to that handsome young man behind
her--for it is he whom she has hitherto fancied herself in love with."

As if the half-caste had guessed the movement of rage and hatred, which this revelation would
excite in the heart of the prince, he hastily added: "Calmness and disdain! Is it not his turn
now to hate you?"

The prince restrained himself, and drew his hand across his forehead which glowed with anger.

"There now! what are you telling him, that vexes him so?" said Rose Pompon to Faringhea, with
pouting lip. Then, addressing Djalma, she continued: "Come, Prince Charming, as they say in
the fairy-tale, give me back my flowers."

As she took it again, she added: "You have kissed it, and I could almost eat it." Then, with
a sigh, and a passionate glance at Djalma, she said softly to herself: "That monster Ninny
Moulin did not deceive me. All this is quite proper; I have not even that to reproach myself
with." And with her little white teeth, she bit at a rosy nail of her right hand, from which
she had just drawn the glove.

It is hardly necessary to say, that Adrienne's letter had not been delivered to the prince,
and that he had not gone to pass the day in the country with Marshal Simon. During the three
days in which Montbron had not seen Djalma, Faringhea had persuaded him, that, by affecting
another passion, he would bring Mdlle. de Cardoville to terms. With regard to Djalma's presence
at the theatre, Rodin had learned from her maid, Florine, that her mistress was to go in the
evening to the Porte-Saint Martin. To strength of fixed and stare whether djalma solitudes, and her

 He slowly descended the line of painted rocks, which came sloping down towards the
centre of the stage. From time to time, he stopped as if to listen, and appeared to advance
with caution. Looking from one side to the other, his eyes involuntarily encountered the large,
green eyes of the Englishman, whose box was close to the cavern. Instantly the lion-tamer's
countenance was contracted in so frightful a manner, that Lady Morinval, who was examining
him closely with the aid of an excellent glass, said hastily to Adrienne: "My dear, the man
is afraid. Some misfortune will happen."
