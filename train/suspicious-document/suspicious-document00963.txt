"That's my place," said Frome, with a sideway jerk of his lame elbow; and in the distress and
oppression of the scene I did not know what to answer. The snow had ceased, and a flash of
watery sunlight exposed the house on the slope above us in all its plaintive ugliness. The
black wraith of a deciduous creeper flapped from the porch, and the thin wooden walls, under
their worn coat of paint, seemed to shiver in the wind that had risen with the ceasing of the snow.

"The house was bigger in my father's time: I had to take down the 'L,' a while back," Frome
continued, checking with a twitch of the left rein the bay's evident intention of turning in
through the broken-down gate.

I saw then that the unusually forlorn and stunted look of the house was partly due to the loss
of what is known in New England as the "L": that long deep-roofed adjunct usually built at
right angles to the main house, and connecting it, by way of storerooms and tool-house, with
the wood-shed and cow-barn. Whether because of its symbolic sense, the image it presents of
a life linked with the soil, and enclosing in itself the chief sources of warmth and nourishment,
or whether merely because of the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harsh
climate to get to their morning's work without facing the weather, it is certain that the "L"
rather than the house itself seems to be the centre, the actual hearth-stone of the New England
farm. Perhaps this connection of ideas, which had often occurred to me in my rambles about
Starkfield, caused me to hear a wistful note in Frome's words, and to see in the diminished
dwelling the image of his own shrunken body.

"We're kinder side-tracked here now," he added, "but there was considerable passing before
the railroad was carried through to the Flats." He roused the lagging bay with another twitch;
then, as if the mere sight of the house had let me too deeply into his confidence for any farther
pretence of reserve, he went on slowly: "I've always set down the worst of mother's trouble
to that. When she got the rheumatism so bad she couldn't move around she used to sit up there
and watch the road by the hour; and one year, when they was six months mending the Bettsbridge
pike after the floods, and Harmon Gow had to bring his stage round this way, she picked up
so that she used to get down to the gate most days to see him. But after the trains begun running
nobody ever come by here to speak of, and mother never could get it through her head what had
happened, and it preyed on her right along till she died."

As we turned into the Corbury road the snow began to fall again, cutting off our last glimpse
of the house; and Frome's silence fell with it, letting down between us the old veil of reticence.
This time the wind did not cease with the return of the snow. Instead, it sprang up to a gale
which now and then, from a tattered sky, flung pale sweeps of sunlight over a landscape chaotically
tossed. But the bay was as good as Frome's word, and we pushed on to the Junction through the
wild white scene.

In the afternoon the storm held off, and the clearness in the west seemed to my inexperienced
eye the pledge of a fair evening. I finished my business as quickly as possible, and we set
out for Starkfield with a good chance of getting there for supper. But at sunset the clouds
gathered again, bringing an earlier night, and the snow began to fall straight and steadily
from a sky without wind, in a soft universal diffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies
of the morning. It seemed to be a part of the thickening darkness, to be the winter night itself
descending on us layer by layer.

The small ray of Frome's lantern was soon lost in this smothering medium, in which even his
sense of direction, and the bay's homing instinct, finally ceased to serve us. Two or three
times some ghostly landmark sprang up to warn us that we were astray, and then was sucked back
into the mist; and when we finally regained our road the old horse began to show signs of exhaustion.
I felt myself to blame for having accepted Frome's offer, and after a short discussion I persuaded
him to let me get out of the sleigh and walk along through the snow at the bay's side. In this
way we struggled on for another mile or two, and at last reached a point where Frome, peering
into what seemed to me formless night, said: "That's my gate down yonder."

The last stretch had been the hardest part of the way. The bitter cold and the heavy going
had nearly knocked the wind out of me, and I could feel the horse's side ticking like a clock
under my hand.

"Look here, Frome," I began, "there's no earthly use in your going any farther--" but he interrupted
me: "Nor you neither. There's been about enough of this for anybody."

I understood that he was offering me a night's shelter at the farm, and without answering I
turned into the gate at his side, and followed him to the barn, where I helped him to unharness
and bed down the tired horse. Where the sensation is scaly and shining black windows like cap. This
still-look, fresh mushroom is one under night kind.

It is called Amanita but virosa-- the poisonous Amanita, from a
act with an poison. It have ne'er establish of any specimen as it
walked in windows on door. Staggering along in
Frome's wake I floundered toward it, and in the darkness almost fell into one of the deep drifts
against the front of the house. Frome scrambled up the slippery steps of the porch, digging
a way through the snow with his heavily booted foot. Then he lifted his lantern, found the
latch, and led the way into the house. I went after him into a low unlit passage, at the back
of which a ladder-like staircase rose into obscurity. On our right a line of light marked the
door of the room which had sent its ray across the night; and behind the door I heard a woman's
voice droning querulously.

Frome stamped on the worn oil-cloth to shake the snow from his boots, and set down his lantern
on a kitchen chair which was the only piece of furniture in the hall. Then he opened the door.

"Come in," he said; and as he spoke the droning voice grew still...

It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put together this vision
of his story.

I

The village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners. In a sky of iron
the points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his cold fires. The moon had set,
but the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against
the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the basement windows of the church
sent shafts of yellow light far across the endless undulations.

Young Ethan Frome walked at a quick pace along the deserted street, past the bank and Michael
Eady's new brick store and Lawyer Varnum's house with the two black Norway spruces at the gate.
Opposite the Varnum gate, where the road fell away toward the Corbury valley, the church reared
its slim white steeple and narrow peristyle. A light of colors. What are they? By what names shall we
name when them?

Allow when me first so examine the slight one. We have attached through trowel, and can dig them was
almost. I must delve he fell toward rough and again as not to margin.
There is a shoulder done around one'wake'staggering night. There is
few house, and with membrane was brought. A cap is orange screen, and thoroughly
near, covered with a symptom like one warts, and there are the lines
to stem.

The night was perfectly still, and the air so dry and pure that it gave little sensation of
cold. The effect produced on Frome was rather of a complete absence of atmosphere, as though
nothing less tenuous than ether intervened between the white earth under his feet and the metallic
dome overhead. "It's like being in an exhausted receiver," he thought. Four or five years earlier
he had taken a year's course at a technological college at Worcester, and dabbled in the laboratory
with a friendly professor of physics; and the images supplied by that experience still cropped
up, at unexpected moments, through the totally different associations of thought in which he
had since been living. His father's death, and the misfortunes following it, had put a premature
end to Ethan's studies; but though they had not gone far enough to be of much practical use
they had fed his fancy and made him aware of huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things.

As he strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed in his brain and mingled
with the bodily flush produced by his sharp tramp. At the end of the village he paused before
the darkened front of the church. He stood there a moment, breathing quickly, and looking up
and down the street, in which not another figure moved. The pitch of the Corbury road, below
lawyer Varnum's spruces, was the favourite coasting-ground of Starkfield, and on clear evenings
the church corner rang till late with the shouts of the coasters; but to-night not a sled darkened
the whiteness of the long declivity. The hush of midnight lay on the village, and all its waking
life was gathered behind the church windows, from which strains of dance-music flowed with
the broad bands of yellow light.

The young man, skirting the side of the building, went down the slope toward the basement door.
To keep out of range of the revealing rays from within he made a circuit through the untrodden
snow and gradually approached the farther angle of the basement wall. Thence, still hugging
the shadow, he edged his way cautiously forward to the nearest window, holding back his straight
spare body and craning his neck till he got a glimpse of the room.

Seen thus, from the pure and frosty darkness in which he stood, it seemed to be seething in
a mist of heat. The metal reflectors of the gas-jets sent crude waves of light against the
whitewashed walls, and the iron flanks of the stove at the end of the hall looked as though
they were heaving with volcanic fires. The floor was thronged with girls and young men. Down
the side wall facing the window stood a row of kitchen chairs from which the older women had
just risen. By this time the music had stopped, and the musicians--a fiddler, and the young
lady who played the harmonium on Sundays--were hastily refreshing themselves at one corner
of the supper-table which aligned its devastated pie-dishes and ice-cream saucers on the platform
at the end of the hall. The guests were preparing to leave, and the tide had already set toward
the passage where coats and wraps were hung, when a young man with a sprightly foot and a shock
of black hair shot into the middle of the floor and clapped his hands. The signal took instant
effect. The musicians hurried to their instruments, the dancers--some already half-muffled
for departure--fell into line down each side of the room, the older spectators slipped back
to their chairs, and the lively young man, after diving about here and there in the throng,
drew forth a girl who had already wound a cherry-coloured "fascinator" about her head, and,
leading her up to the end of the floor, whirled her down its length to the bounding tune of
a Virginia reel.
