It may seem quite superfluous to give advice against luxury in furnishing except where it is
warranted by exceptional means, because each family naturally adjusts its furnishing to its
own needs and circumstances; but the influence of mere beauty is very powerful, and many a
costly toy drifts into homes where it does not rightly belong and where, instead of being an
educational or elevating influence, it is a source of mental deterioration, from its conflict
with unsympathetic circumstances. A long and useful chapter might be written upon "art out
of place," but nothing which could be said upon the subject would apply to that incorporation
of art and beauty with furniture and interior surrounding, which is the effort and object of
every true artist and art-lover.

 When
these are used for both walls and ceiling, it will be found that, to give the necessary variation,
and prevent an impression of monotony and dulness, some tint must be added in the ornament
of the surface, which could be gained by a forcible deepening or variation of the general tone,
like a deep golden brown, which is the lowest tone of the scale of yellow, or a red which would
be only a variant of the prevailing tint. When his horse made a step, which was not unfrequent, because

 The white
lines in the design answer to the white spaces in the decorated china, and the two used together
in profusion have an unexpectedly decorative effect. The table and chairs are, of course, of
the same coloured wood used in the ceiling and wainscot, and the rug is an India cotton of
dark and light blues and white. The sideboard is an arrangement of fixed shelves, but covered
with a beautiful collection of blue china, which serves to furnish the table as well. If the
dining-room had a northern exposure, and it was desirable to use red instead of blue for colouring,
as good an effect could be secured by depending for ornament upon the red Kaga porcelain so
common at present in Japanese and Chinese shops, and using with it the Eastern cotton known

Gold-coloured or yellow canvas with oak mouldings lighten and warm the walls; and rugs with
a preponderance of white and yellow transform a dark hall into a light and cheerful one. It
must be remembered that few dark colours can assert themselves in the absolute shadow of a
north light. Green and blue become black. Gold, orange, and red alone have sufficient power
to hold their own, and make us conscious of them in darkness.
