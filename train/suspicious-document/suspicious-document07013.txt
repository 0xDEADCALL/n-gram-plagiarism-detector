But the work for which it seems to me that Fra Giocondo deserves the greatest praise is one
on account of which an everlasting gratitude is due to him not only from the Venetians, but
from the whole world as well. For he reflected that the life of the Republic of Venice depended
in great measure on the preservation of its impregnable position on the lagoons on which that
city, as it were by a miracle, is built; and that, whenever those lagoons silted up with earth,
the air would become infected and pestilential, and the city consequently uninhabitable, or
at the least exposed to all the dangers that threaten cities on the mainland. He set himself,
therefore, to think in what way it might be possible to provide for the preservation of the
lagoons and of the site on which the city had been built in the beginning. And having found
a way, Fra Giocondo told the Signori that, if they did not quickly come to some resolution
about preventing such an evil, in a few years, to judge by that which could be seen to have
happened in part, they would become aware of their error, without being in time to be able
to retrieve it. Roused by this warning, and hearing the powerful arguments of Fra Giocondo,
the Signori summoned an assembly of the best engineers and architects that there were in Italy,
at which many opinions were given and many designs made; but that of Fra Giocondo was held
to be the best, and was put into execution. They made a beginning, therefore, with excavating
a great canal, which was to divert two-thirds or at least one-half of the water brought down
by the River Brenta, and to conduct that water by a long détour so as to debouch into the lagoons
of Chioggia; and thus that river, no longer flowing into the lagoons at Venice, has not been
able to fill them up by bringing down earth, as it has done at Chioggia, where it has filled
and banked up the lagoons in such a manner that, where there was formerly water, many tracts
of land and villas have sprung up, to the great benefit of the city of Venice. Wherefore it
is the opinion of many persons, and in particular of the Magnificent Messer Luigi Cornaro,
a Venetian gentleman of ripe wisdom gained both by learning and by long experience, that, if
it had not been for the warning of Fra Giocondo, all the silting up that took place in the
lagoons of Chioggia would have happened, and perhaps on a greater scale, in those of Venice,
inflicting incredible damage and almost ruin on that city. The same Messer Luigi, who was very
much the friend of Fra Giocondo, as he is and always has been of all men of talent, declares
that his native city of Venice owes an eternal debt of gratitude for this to the memory of
Fra Giocondo, who on this account, he says, might reasonably be called the second founder of
Venice; and that he almost deserves more praise for having preserved by that expedient the
grandeur and nobility of that marvellous and puissant city, than do those who built it at the
beginning in such a weak and ill-considered fashion, seeing that the benefit received from
him will be to all eternity, as it has been hitherto, of incalculable utility and advantage
to Venice.

Not many years after Fra Giocondo had executed this divine work, the Venetians suffered a great
loss in the burning of the Rialto, the place in which are the magazines of their most precious
merchandise--the treasure, as it were, of that city. This happened at the very time when that
Republic had been reduced by long-continued wars and by the loss of the greater part, or rather
almost the whole, of her dominions on the mainland to a desperate condition; and the Signori
then governing were full of doubt and hesitation as to what they should do. However, the rebuilding
of that place being a matter of the greatest importance, they resolved that it should be reconstructed
at all costs. And wishing to give it all possible grandeur, in keeping with the greatness and
magnificence of that Republic, and having already recognized the talent of Fra Giocondo and
his great ability in architecture, they gave him the commission to make a design for that structure;
whereupon he drew one in the following manner. He proposed to occupy all the space that lies
between the Canale delle Beccherie,[1] in the Rialto, and the Rio del Fondaco delle Farine,[2]
taking as much ground between one canal and the other as would make a perfect square--that
is, the length of the sides of this fabric was to be as great as the space which one covers
at the present day in walking from the debouchure of one of those canals into the Grand Canal
to that of the other. He intended, also, that the same two canals should debouch on the other
side into a common canal, which was to run from the one to the other, so that the fabric might
be left entirely surrounded by water, having the Grand Canal on one side, the two smaller canals
on two other sides, and on the last the new canal that was to be made. Then he desired that
between the water and the buildings, right round the square, there should be made, or rather
should be left, a beach or quay of some breadth, which might serve as a piazza for the selling
in duly appointed places of the vegetables, fruits, fish, and other things, that come from
many parts to the city. It was also his opinion that right round the outer side of the buildings
there should be erected shops looking out upon those same quays, and that these shops should
serve only for the sale of eatables of every kind. And in these four sides the design of Fra
Giocondo had four principal gates--namely, one to each side, placed in the centre, one directly
opposite to another. But before going into the central piazza, by whichever side one entered,
one would have found both on the right hand and on the left a street which ran round the block
of buildings and had shops on either side, with handsome workshops above them and magazines
for the use of those shops, which were all to be devoted to the sale of woven fabrics--that
is, fine woollen cloth and silk, which are the two chief products of that city. This street,
in short, was to contain all the shops that are called the Tuscan's and the silk-merchant's.

From this double range of shops there was to be access by way of the four gates into the centre
of the whole block--that is to say, into a vast piazza surrounded on every side by spacious
and beautiful loggie for the accommodation of the merchants and for the use of the great number
of people who flock together for the purposes of their trade and commerce to that city, which
is the custom-house of all Italy, or rather of Europe. Under those loggie, on every side, were
to be the shops of the bankers, goldsmiths, and jewellers; and in the centre was to be built
a most beautiful temple dedicated to S. Matthew, in which the people of quality might be able
to hear the divine offices in the morning. With regard to this temple, however, some persons
declare that Fra Giocondo changed his mind, and wished to build two under the loggie, so as
not to obstruct the piazza. And, in addition, this superb structure was to have so many other
conveniences, embellishments, and adornments, all in their proper places, that whoever sees
at the present day the beautiful design that Fra Giocondo made for the whole, declares that
nothing more lovely, more magnificent, or planned with better order, could be imagined or conceived
by the most excellent of craftsmen, be his genius never so happy.

It was proposed, also, with the advice of the same master, and as a completion to this work,
to build the Bridge of the Rialto of stone, covered with shops, which would have been a marvellous
thing. But this enterprise was not carried into effect, for two reasons: first, because the
Republic, on account of the extraordinary expenses incurred in the last war, happened to be
drained dry of money; and, secondly, because a gentleman of great position and much authority
at that time (of the family, so it is said, of Valereso), being a man of little judgment in
such matters, and perchance influenced by some private interest, chose to favour one Maestro
Zanfragnino,[3] who, so I am informed, is still alive, and who had worked for him on buildings
of his own. This Zanfragnino--a fit and proper name for a master of his calibre--made the design
for that medley of marble which was afterwards carried into execution, and which is still to
be seen; and many who are still alive, and remember the circumstances very well, are even yet
not done with lamenting that foolish choice.

Fra Giocondo, having seen that shapeless design preferred to his beautiful one, and having
perceived how much more virtue there often is in favour than in merit with nobles and great
persons, felt such disdain that he departed from Venice, nor would he ever return, although
he was much entreated to do it. And the design, with others by the same monk, remained in the
house of the Bragadini, opposite to S. Marina, in the possession of Frate Angelo, a member
of that family and a friar of S. Dominic, who, by reason of his many merits, afterwards became
Bishop of Vicenza.

Fra Giocondo was very versatile, and delighted, in addition to the pursuits already mentioned,
in simples and in agriculture. Thus Messer Donato Giannotti, the Florentine, who was very much
his friend for many years in France, relates that once, when living in that country, the monk
reared a peach-tree in an earthen pot, and that this little tree, when he saw it, was so laden
with fruit that it was a marvellous sight. On one occasion, by the advice of some friends,
he had set it in a place where the King was to pass and would be able to see it, when certain
courtiers, who passed by first, plucked all the peaches off that little tree, as suchlike people
were sure to do, and, playing about with one another, scattered what they could not eat along
the whole length of the street, to the great displeasure of Fra Giocondo. The matter coming
to the ears of the King, he first laughed over the jest with the courtiers, and then, after
thanking the monk for what he had done to please him, gave him a present of such a kind that
he was consoled.

Fra Giocondo was a man of saintly and most upright life, much beloved by all the great men
of letters of his age, and in particular by Domizio Calderino, Matteo Bosso, and Paolo Emilio,
the writer of the History of France, all three his compatriots. Very much his friends, likewise,
were Sannazzaro, Budé, and Aldus Manutius, with all the Academy of Rome; and he had a disciple
in Julius Cæsar Scaliger, one of the most learned men of our times. Finally, being very old,
he died, but precisely at what time and in what place this happened, and consequently where
he was buried, is not known.

Even as it is true that the city of Verona is very similar to Florence in situation, manners,
and other respects, so it is also true that in the first as well as in the second there have
always flourished men of the finest genius in all the noblest and most honourable professions.
Saying nothing of the learned, for with them I have nothing to do here, and continuing to speak
of the men of our arts, who have always had an honourable abode in that most noble city, I
come to Liberale of Verona, a disciple of Vincenzio di Stefano, a native of the same city,
already mentioned in another place, who executed for the Church of Ognissanti, belonging to
the Monks of S. Benedict, at Mantua, in the year 1463, a Madonna that was a very praiseworthy
example of the work of those times. Liberale imitated the manner of Jacopo Bellini, for when
a young man, while the said Jacopo was painting the Chapel of S. Niccolò at Verona, he gave
his attention under Bellini to the studies of design in such thorough fashion that, forgetting
all that he had learned from Vincenzio di Stefano, he acquired the manner of Bellini and retained
it ever after.

The first paintings of Liberale were in the Chapel of the Monte della Pietà in S. Bernardino,
in his native city; and there, in the principal picture, he painted a Deposition from the Cross,
with certain Angels, some of whom have in their hands the Mysteries (for so they are called)
of the Passion, and all with their weeping faces show grief at the Death of the Saviour. Very
natural, in truth, are these figures, as are other works of the same kind by this master, who
strove to show in many places that he was able to paint weeping countenances. This may also
be seen in S. Anastasia, a church of Friars of S. Dominic, likewise in Verona, where he painted
a Dead Christ with the Maries mourning for Him on the pediment of the Chapel of the Buonaveri;
and he executed many pictures in the same manner of painting as the work mentioned above, which
are dispersed among the houses of various gentlemen in Verona.

In the same chapel he painted a God the Father surrounded by many Angels who are playing instruments
and singing, with three figures on either side--S. Peter, S. Dominic, and S. Thomas Aquinas
on one side, and S. Lucia, S. Agnese, and another female Saint on the other; but the first
three are much the finer, being executed in a better manner and with more relief. On the main
wall of that chapel he painted Our Lady, with the Infant Christ marrying S. Catharine, the
Virgin-Martyr; and in this work he made a portrait of Messer Piero Buonaveri, the owner of
the chapel. Around this group are some Angels presenting flowers, with some heads that are
smiling, executed with such grace in their gladness, that they prove that he was able to paint
a smiling face as well as he had painted tears in other figures. In the altar-piece of the
same chapel he painted S. Mary Magdalene in the air, supported by some Angels, with S. Catharine
below--a work which was held to be very beautiful. On the altar of the Madonna in the Church
of S. Maria della Scala, belonging to the Servite Friars, he executed the story of the Magi
on two folding-doors that enclose that Madonna, which is held in vast veneration in that city;
but the work did not long remain there, for it was removed because it was being spoilt by the
smoke of the candles, and placed in the sacristy, where it is much admired by the painters
of Verona.

In the tramezzo[4] of the Church of S. Bernardino, above the Chapel of the Company of the Magdalene,
he painted in fresco the story of the Purification, wherein is a figure of Simeon that is much
extolled, as also is that of the Infant Christ, who with great affection is kissing that old
man, who is holding Him in his arms; and very beautiful, likewise, is a priest standing there
on one side, who, with his arms extended and his face uplifted towards Heaven, appears to be
thanking God for the salvation of the world. Beside this chapel is a picture of the story of
the Magi by the hand of the same Liberale; and in the pediment of the picture there is the
Death of the Madonna, executed with little figures, which are highly extolled. Great, indeed,
was his delight in painting works with little figures, with which he always took such pains
that they seem to be the work rather of an illuminator than of a painter, as may be seen in
the Duomo of the same city, where there is a picture by his hand of the story of the Magi,
with a vast number of little figures, horses, dogs, and various other animals, and near them
a group of rosy-coloured Cherubim, who serve as a support to the Mother of Jesus. In this picture
the heads are so finished, and everything is executed with such diligence, that, as I have
said, it appears to be the work of an illuminator.

He also painted stories of Our Lady on a small predella, likewise after the manner of miniatures,
for the Chapel of the Madonna in the Duomo. But this was afterwards removed from that chapel
by order of Monsignor Messer Giovan Matteo Giberti, Bishop of Verona, and placed in the Palace
of the Vescovado, which is the residence of the Bishops, in that chapel wherein they hear Mass
every morning. And there that predella stands in company with a most beautiful Crucifix in
relief, executed by Giovanni Battista Veronese, a sculptor, who now lives in Mantua. Liberale
also painted a panel-picture for the Chapel of the Allegni in S. Vitale, containing a figure
of S. Mestro, the Confessor, a Veronese and a man of great sanctity, whom he placed between
a S. Francis and a S. Dominic. For the Chapel of S. Girolamo in the Vittoria, a church and
convent of certain Eremite Friars, he executed at the commission of the Scaltritegli family
an altar-piece of S. Jerome in the habit of a Cardinal, with a S. Francis and a S. Paul, all
much extolled. And in the tramezzo[5] of the Church of S. Giovanni in Monte he painted the
Circumcision of Christ and other works, which were destroyed not long since, because it was
considered that the tramezzo impaired the beauty of the church.

Being then summoned to Siena by the General of the Monks of Monte Oliveto, Liberale illuminated
many books for that Order; and in these he succeeded so well, that he was commissioned in consequence
to illuminate some that had been left unfinished--that is to say, only written--in the library
of the Piccolomini. He also illuminated some books of plain-song for the Duomo of that city,
where he would have remained longer, executing many works that he had in hand; but, being driven
away by envy and persecution, he set off to return to Verona, with eight hundred crowns that
he had earned, which he lent afterwards to the Monks of Monte Oliveto at S. Maria in Organo,
from whom he drew interest to support him from day to day.

Having thus returned to Verona, he gave his attention for the rest of his life more to illumination
than to any other kind of work. At Bardolino, a place on the Lake of Garda, he painted a panel-picture
which is now in the Pieve; and another for the Church of S. Tommaso Apostolo. For the Chapel
of S. Bernardo, likewise, in the Church of S. Fermo, a convent of Friars of S. Francis, he
painted a panel-picture of the first-named Saint, with some scenes from his life in the predella.
In the same place, also, and in others, he executed many nuptial pictures, one of which, containing
the Madonna with the Child in her arms marrying S. Catharine, is in the house of Messer Vincenzio
de' Medici at Verona.

On the corner of the house of the Cartai, on the way from the Ponte Nuovo to S. Maria in Organo,
in Verona, he painted a Madonna and S. Joseph in fresco, a work which was much extolled. Liberale
would have liked to paint the Chapel of the Riva family, which had been built in order to honour
the memory of Giovanni Riva, a captain of men-at-arms at the battle of the Taro, in the Church
of S. Eufemia; but he did not receive the commission, which was given to some strangers, and
he was told that he was too old and that his sight was failing him. When this chapel was opened,
a vast number of faults were perceived in it, and Liberale said that he who had given the commission
had been much more blind than himself.

to surely shall have to have exactly "this angel and his circumcision,"

Before giovan (1867), standard, as besides being drawn, its component to be three man were professed
inches.
 And for the Prior of the Friars of S. Giorgio
he executed a little panel-picture of the Manger, in which he may be seen to have greatly improved
his manner, since the heads of the shepherds and of all the other figures have expressions
so sweet and so beautiful, that this work was much extolled, and that rightly; and if it were
not that the priming of gesso is peeling off through having been badly prepared, so that the
picture is gradually perishing, it would be enough by itself to keep him alive for ever in
the memory of his fellow-citizens.

Next, having been commissioned by the men who governed the Company of the Angel Raphael to
paint their chapel in the Church of S. Eufemia, he executed therein two stories of the Angel
Raphael in fresco, and in the altar-piece, in oils, three large Angels, Raphael in the centre,
and Gabriel and Michael on either side, and all with good draughtsmanship and colouring. He
was reproached, indeed, for having made the legs of those Angels too slender and wanting in
softness; to which he made a pleasant and gracious answer, saying that even as Angels were
represented with wings and with bodies, so to speak, celestial and ethereal, as if they were
birds, so it was only right to make their legs lean and slender, to the end that they might
fly and soar upwards with greater ease. For that altar of the Church of S. Giorgio where there
is a Christ bearing His Cross, he painted S. Rocco and S. Sebastian, with some scenes in the
predella executed with very beautiful little figures. And by order of the Company of the Madonna
he painted on the predella of the altar of that Company, in S. Bernardino, the Nativity of
the Madonna and the Massacre of the Innocents, with a great variety of attitudes in the murderers
and in the groups of children whom their mothers are defending with all their might. This work
is held in great veneration, and is kept covered, the better to preserve it; and it was the
reason that the men of the Fraternity of S. Stefano commissioned him to paint three pictures
with similar figures for their altar in the old Duomo of Verona, containing three little scenes
from the life of Our Lady--her Marriage, the Nativity of Christ, and the story of the Magi.

After these works, thinking that he had gained enough credit in Verona, Giovan Francesco was
minded to depart and make trial of other places; but his friends and relatives, pressing him
much, persuaded him to take to wife a young woman of noble birth, the daughter of Messer Braliassarti
Grandoni, whom he married in 1505. In a short time, however, after he had had a son by her,
she died in child-birth; and Giovan Francesco, thus left free, departed from Verona and went
off to Milan, where Signor Anton Maria Visconti received him into his house and caused him
to execute many works for its adornment.

Meanwhile there was brought to Milan by a Fleming a head of a young man, taken from life and
painted in oils, which was admired by everyone in that city; but Giovan Francesco, seeing it,
laughed and said: "I am confident that I can do a better." At which the Fleming mocked him,
but after many words the matter came to this, that Giovan Francesco was to try his hand, losing
his own picture and twenty-five crowns if he lost, and winning the Fleming's head and likewise
twenty-five crowns if he won. Setting to work, therefore, with all his powers, Giovan Francesco
made a portrait of an aged gentleman with shaven face, with a falcon on his wrist; but, although
this was a good likeness, the head of the Fleming was judged to be the better. Giovan Francesco
did not make a good choice in executing his portrait, for he took a head that could not do
him honour; whereas, if he had chosen a handsome young man, and had made as good a likeness
of him as he did of the old man, he would at least have equalled his adversary's picture, even
if he had not surpassed it. But for all this the head of Giovan Francesco did not fail to win
praise, and the Fleming showed him courtesy, for he contented himself with the head of the
shaven old man, and, being a noble and courteous person, would by no means accept the five-and-twenty
crowns. This picture came after some time into the possession of Madonna Isabella d'Este, Marchioness
of Mantua, who paid a very good price for it to the Fleming and placed it as a choice work
in her study, in which she had a vast number of very beautiful coins, pictures, works in marble,
and castings.

After completing his work for Visconti, Giovan Francesco, being invited by Guglielmo, Marquis
of Montferrat, went willingly to serve him, as Visconti straitly besought him to do. On his
arrival, a fine provision was assigned to him; and, setting to work, he painted for that noble
at Casale, in a chapel where he heard Mass, as many pictures as were necessary to fill it and
adorn it on every side, with subjects from the Old Testament and the New, which were executed
by him with supreme diligence, as was also the chief altar-piece. He then executed many works
throughout the apartments of that Castle, which brought him very great fame. And in S. Domenico,
by order of that Marquis, he painted the whole of the principal chapel for the adornment of
the tomb wherein he was to be laid to rest; in which work Giovan Francesco acquitted himself
so well, that he was rightly rewarded with honourable gifts by the liberality of his patron,
who also favoured him by making him one of his own chamberlains, as may be seen from an instrument
that is in the possession of his heirs at Verona. He made portraits of that lord and of his
wife, with many pictures that they sent to France, and also the portrait of Guglielmo, their
eldest child, who was then a boy, and likewise portraits of their daughters and of all the
ladies who were in the service of the Marchioness.

On the death of the Marquis Guglielmo, Giovan Francesco departed from Casale, after first selling
all the property that he had in those parts, and made his way to Verona, where he so arranged
his affairs and those of his son, to whom he gave a wife, that in a short time he found himself
in possession of more than seven thousand ducats. But he did not therefore abandon his painting;
indeed, having a quiet mind, and not being obliged to rack his brain for a livelihood, he gave
more attention to it than ever. The works of a authors show, nothing of whole friars and clouds, [244] that,
in pyramid, and this subservience were seated for Rocco was seated, was the coffer as the air of angels,
and most "geometric bell is make in the work to it do." The accounts of it published by pyramid.
Smyth, and nothing in coffer. s'Taylor first object, farther standard that the figure, were
highly or he could either, had a belief of executing form, and of "sebastian
life," "externally polished, and of a preservation-envy consistency"
 In the air is Our Lady seated in
the lap of S. Anne, with some Angels standing upon clouds, and beneath are S. Peter, S. John
the Baptist, S. Rocco, and S. Sebastian; and not far away, in a most beautiful landscape, is
S. Francis receiving the Stigmata. This work, indeed, is held by craftsmen to be not otherwise
than good.

For the Chapel of the Cross in S. Bernardino, a seat of the Frati Zoccolanti, he painted Christ
kneeling on one knee and taking leave of His Mother. In this work, stirred to emulation by
the many notable pictures by the hands of other masters that are in that place, he strove to
surpass them all; wherefore, in truth, he acquitted himself very well, and was praised by all
who saw it, save only by the Guardian of that convent, who, like the boorish and solemn fool
that he was, reproved Giovan Francesco with biting words, saying that he had made Christ show
such little reverence to His Mother as to kneel only upon one knee. To which Giovan Francesco
answered by saying: "Father, first do me the favour of kneeling down and rising up again, and
I will then tell you for what reason I have painted Christ so." The Guardian, after much persuasion,
knelt down, placing on the ground first his right knee and then his left; and in rising up
he raised first the left and then the right. Which done, Giovan Francesco said: "Did you observe,
Father Guardian, that you neither knelt down nor rose up with both knees together? I tell you,
therefore, that this Christ of mine is right, because one might say that He is either coming
to His knees before His Mother, or beginning, after having knelt a while, to raise one leg
in order to rise." At which the Guardian had to appear a little appeased, although he went
off muttering under his breath.
