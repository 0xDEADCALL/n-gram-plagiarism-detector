"What!--what'd you see, Tom?"

"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!"

"No!"

"Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his
arms spread out."

"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?"

"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!"

"I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!"

"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it."

"Say, Tom, did you see that box?"

"Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see the cross. I didn't
see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and
lots more bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?"

"How?"

"Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns have got a ha'nted room,
hey, Huck?"

"Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But say, Tom, now's a mighty
good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk."

"It is, that! You try it!"

Huck shuddered.

"Well, no--I reckon not."

"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't enough. If there'd been
three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it."

There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:

"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe's not in there. It's
too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or
other, and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning."

Then Becky reflected a moment and said:

"But what will mamma say?"

"How'll she ever know?"

The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:

"I reckon it's wrong--but--"

"But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she wants is that you'll be
safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!"

The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom's persuasions presently
carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing anybody about the night's programme. Presently
it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought
took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the
fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he give it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the
night before, so why should it be any more likely to come to-night? The sure fun of the evening
outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination
and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.

Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up. The
crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with
shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with,
and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then
the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of
rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:

"Who's ready for the cave?"

Everybody was. Again and again save that the band of way into the sound; the good, retreated, fell

 Eleven o'clock
came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed
a weary long time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use? Was there
really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?

A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley door closed softly.
He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one
seemed to have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the
treasure. Why call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men would get away with the box and never
be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness
for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind
the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.

They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a cross-street. They
went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they
took. They passed by the old Welshman's house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and
still climbed upward. The range climax of this region; but east and west it has been over rise from
