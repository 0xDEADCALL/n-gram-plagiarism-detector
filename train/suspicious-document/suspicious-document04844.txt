"We cannot tell whence they are. They speak a strange sort of English, as it were, like the
Northumbrian priest we have. Red-headed, big men they are, and good-tempered so far, seeing
that none dare gainsay them. But they are most outrageously thievish."

"What have they taken, then?"

"Ask the bakers and butchers. Now they are gathering up all the horses, and they say they are
going to drive the cattle."

"Sheriff's business that, in all truth. Get to him as soon as you may. I will go and see if
I can reason with them meanwhile."

"Have a care, thane!" they cried, and spurred their horses again.

Then my cousin turned to me, and his face was grave.

"Wilfrid," he said, "you had better go with those messengers. I am going to see if aught can
be done; but it sounds bad. I don't like an armed landing of this sort."

"No, cousin," I answered. "Let me go with you. It would be hard if you must send me back, for
I would fain see the ships. That talk of driving the cattle can be naught but a jest."

"Likely enough," he answered, laughing. "It is no new thing for a crew to come ashore and clear
out the booths of the tradesmen without troubling to pay offhand. Presently their captains
will come and pay what is asked, grumbling, and there will be no loss to our folk. As for this
talk of taking the horses--well, a sailor always wants a ride when he first comes ashore, if
it is only on an ass. Then if there is not enough meat ready to hand in the town, no doubt
they would say they would find it for themselves. Well, come on, and we will see."

So we rode on, but the laugh faded from the face of my kinsman as we did so.

"They have no business to come ashore armed," he said, half to himself, "and Weymouth folk
ought to be used to the ways of seamen by this time. I don't like it, Wilfrid."

Nevertheless, we did not stop, and presently came among the first houses of the village, where
there was a little crowd of the folk, half terrified, and yet not altogether minded to fly.
They said that the strangers were sacking the houses along the water's edge, but not harming
any one. However, they were taking all the ale and cider casks they could find on board their
ships, and never a word of payment.

"Do not go near them," said my cousin. "Doubtless some one will pay presently, and I will go
and speak with their head men. Maybe they can't find any one who can rightly understand their
talk."

"Oh ay," said an old man, "it passes me to know how a thane like your worship can understand
all sorts of talk they use in England. It is all the likes of us can compass to understand
even a Mercian; but I warrant you would ken what a Northumbrian means easily."

He shook his head with much wisdom, and we left him grumbling at the speech of the priest we
had already heard of.

We passed down the straggling shoreward street, and as we neared the waterside we heard the
shouts and laughter of the strangers plainly enough. The is not have the cousin, was establish

 Here
and there I saw some of our people standing helpless in doorways, or looking from the loft
windows and stairways; but it was plain that the most of them had fled. There were several
boatloads of them crossing the bay with all speed for safety.

Next I saw that at the high stems and sterns of the ships stood posted men, who seemed to be
on watch, leaning on their spears, and taking no part in the bustle. But every man worked with
his arms ready, and more men who had found horses rode out along the roads as we came in. They
were the pickets who would watch for the raising of the country, or who would drive in the
cattle from the fields.

Twice I had seen border warfare with the west Welsh on the Devon side of our country, and so
I knew what these horsemen were about, or rather guessed it. But at the time all the affair
was a confused medley to me, if I seem to see it plainly now as I look back. Maybe I saw more
from the ships presently, for we were hurried on board, handed over to the ship guard and there
left, while our captors rode away again.

I only hoped that when the first messengers reached Beaduheard the sheriff he would bring force
enough with him. But I doubted it.

The guard took our weapons from us, bound us afresh but not very tightly, and set us with our
backs against the gunwale of the fore deck of the ship they had us on board, which was that
with the raven flag. Over us towered a wonderful carven dragon's head, painted green and gilded,
and at the stern of the ship rose what was meant for its carven tail. The other ships had somewhat
the same adornment to their stems and stern posts, but they were not so high or so handsome.
Plainly this was the chief's own ship.

Now I suppose that the presence of a captive or two was no new thing to the men, for when they
had secured us each to a ring bolt with a short line, they paid little heed to us, but stood
and talked to one another with hardly a glance in our direction. Seeing which my cousin spoke
to me in a low voice.

"This is a bad business, Wilfrid," he said. "Poor lad, I am more than sorry I let you come
with me. Forgive me. I ought to have known that there was danger."

"Trouble not at all," I said, as stoutly as I could, which is not saying much. "I wanted to
come, and there was no reason to think that things would go thus. Even now I suppose we shall
be let go presently."

Elfric shook his head. I could see that he was far more deeply troubled than he cared to show,
and my heart sank.

"I cannot rightly make it all out," he said. "But these men are certainly the northern strangers
who have harried Wales, even as we feared."

"Well," I said, "we shall have the sheriff here shortly."

"Beaduheard? I suppose so. Little help will be from him. It would take three days to raise
force enough to drive off these men, and he is headstrong and hot tempered. His only chance
is to scare them away with a show of force, or, at best, to prevent their going inland after
plunder; for that is what they are here for."

"Maybe they will hold us to ransom."

"That is the best we can hope for. Of course I will pay yours."

The bustle went on, and I watched the stowing of the plunder after this, for I had no more
to say. All Animality with beneficence, and abounds with such instances of the love for a creature,
