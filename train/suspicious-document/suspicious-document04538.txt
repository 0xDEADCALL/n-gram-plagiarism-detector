was that Columbus saw is not certain; it was probably the light from a torch held by some native
woman from the door of her hut; but the light that you will see is from the lighthouse on Dixon
Hill, where a tower of coral holds a lamp one hundred and sixty feet above the sea at the north-east
point of the island. You beat up the heart in his throat and terrified, she looked down and
he fell, fell into an endless depth. She knew: She was on the edge of the tower. She was herself the
