THE COUNTRY OF THE NEUTRALS.

BY

JAMES R. COYNE.

In that part of the township of Southwold included in the peninsula between Talbot Creek and
the most westerly bend of Kettle Creek there were until a relatively recent date several Indian
earthworks, which were well-known to the pioneers of the Talbot Settlement. What the tooth
of time had spared for more than two centuries yielded however to the settler's plough and
harrow, and but one or two of these interesting reminders of an almost forgotten race remain
to gratify the curiosity of the archæologist or of the historian. Fortunately, the most important
of all is still almost in its original condition. It is that, which has become known to readers
of the Transactions of the Canadian Institute as the Southwold Earthwork. It is situated on
the farm of Mr. Chester Henderson, Lot Number Four North on Talbot Road East. Mr. David Boyle
in the Archæological Reports printed in 1891 has given the results of his examinations of the
mounds. A carefully prepared plan made from actual survey by Mr. A. W. Campbell, C.E., for
the Elgin Historical and Scientific Institute of St. Thomas, was presented by the latter to
the Canadian Institute.[1] These will together form a valuable, and, it is hoped, a permanent
record of this interesting memorial of the aboriginal inhabitants of South-western Ontario.

      [1] Mr. J. H. Scott, of St. Thomas, has made a number of
      photographs of the mounds at the instance of an American lady,
      who, it is understood, will reproduce them in a work about to be
      published by her.

The writer of this paper has been acquainted with "the old fort," as it was called, since the
year 1867. At that time it was in the midst of the forest. Since then the woods have been cleared
away, except within the fort and north of it. Indeed, a considerable number of trees have been
felled within the southern part of the enclosure. In the mounds themselves trees are abundant,
and there are many in the moat or ditch between. The stumps of those which have been cut down
are so many chronological facts, from which the age of the fort may be conjectured with some
approach to accuracy. A maple within the enclosure exhibits 242 rings of annual growth. It
was probably the oldest tree within the walls. A maple in the outer embankment shows 197 rings;
between the inner and outer walls a beech stump shows 219 rings, and an elm 266. Many of the
trees were cut down a good many years ago. Judging from these stumps, it would be safe to calculate
the age of the forest at about two hundred years, with here and there a tree a little older.
The area enclosed is level. In the field south there are numerous hummocks formed by the decayed
stumps of fallen trees. The walls were manifestly thrown up from the outside. There is an exception
on the south-east. Here the ground outside was higher, and to get the requisite elevation the
earth was thrown up on both walls from the intervening space, as well as on the exterior wall
from the outside. Each of the walls runs completely round the enclosure, except where the steep
bank of the little stream was utilized to eke out the inner wall for five or six rods on the
west side, as shewn on the plan. Opposite the south end of this gap was the original entrance
through the outer wall. The walls have been cut through in one or two other places, doubtless
by settlers hauling timber across them.

The writer accompanied Mr. Campbell on his visits in the spring and fall of 1891. The members
of the Elgin Historical and Scientific Institute made a pretty thorough examination of a large
ash-heap south-east of the fort. It had, however, been frequently dug into during the last
score or two of years, with ample results, it is said, in the way of stone implements of various
kinds. There still remained, however, arrow-heads and chippings of flint, stones partially
disintegrated from the action of heat, fragments of pottery whose markings showed a very low
stage of artistic development, fish scales, charred maize and bones of small animals, the remains
of aboriginal banquets. Within the enclosure, corn-cobs were found by digging down though the
mould, and a good specimen of a bone needle, well smoothed, but without any decoration, was
turned up in the bed of the stream where it passes through the fort.

the see there was about fall there.


They agreed to all he proposed and in return for his gifts of knives and other trifles, they
adopted him as "citizen and child of the country," and as a mark of great affection entrusted
him to the care of Souharissen, who became his father and host. The latter was, according to
Daillon, the chief of the greatest renown and authority that had ever been known in all the
nations, being chief not only of his own village, but of all those of his nation, to the number
of twenty-eight, besides several little hamlets of seven to eight cabins built in different
places convenient for fishing, hunting, or cultivating the ground. Souharissen had acquired
his absolute and extraordinary authority by his courage and his success in war. He had been
several times at war with the seventeen tribes, who were the enemies of his race, and from
all he had brought back the heads of those he had slain, or prisoners taken alive, as tokens
of his prowess. His authority was without example amongst other tribes.

The Neutrals are reported by Daillon as being very warlike, armed only with war-club and bow,
and dexterous in their use. His companions having gone back, the missionary remained alone,
"the happiest man in the world," seeking to advance the glory of God and to find the mouth
of the river of the Iroquois, (probably the Niagara,) in order to conduct the savages to the
French trading posts. He visited them in their huts, found them very manageable and learned
their customs. He remarked that there were no deformed people amongst them. The children, who
were sprightly, naked and unkempt, were taught by him to make the sign of the Holy Cross.

The natives were willing that at least four canoes should go to trade if he would conduct them,
but nobody knew the way. Yroquet, an Indian known in the country, who had come hunting with
twenty of his tribe and secured five hundred beaver skins, declined to give him any indication
of the mouth of the river; but he agreed with several Hurons in assuring Daillon that a journey
of ten days would take him to the trading post. The missionary, however, was afraid of taking
one river for another and getting lost or perishing of hunger.

For three months he was treated with kindness. Then the Hurons became jealous lest the trade
should be diverted from them. They accordingly circulated rumors through every village, that
Daillon was a great magician, that he had poisoned the air in their country, and many had died
in consequence, that if he was not killed soon, he would burn up their villages and kill their
children, with other stories as extraordinary and alarming about the entire French nation.
The Neutrals were easily influenced by the reports. Daillon's life was in danger on more than
one occasion. The rumor reached Brebeuf and De Noue, that he had been killed. They at once
despatched Grenolle to ascertain the truth, with instructions to bring Daillon back if alive.
He acquiesced, and returned to the Huron country.

He speaks of a Neutral village called Ouaroronon, one day's journey from the Iroquois, the
people of which came to trade at Ounontisaston. Their village was the last of the Neutral villages,
and was probably east of the Niagara River.

Daillon, like every other traveller, was charmed with the Neutral country, which he pronounces
incomparably greater, more beautiful and better than any other "of all these countries." He
notes the incredible number of deer, the native mode of taking them by driving them into a
gradually narrowing enclosure, their practice of killing every animal they find whether they
needed it or not. The reason alleged was that if they did not kill all, the beasts that escaped
would tell the others how they had been chased, so that afterwards when the Indians needed
game it would be impossible to get near it. He enumerates moose, beaver, wild-cats, squirrels
larger than those of France, bustards, turkeys, cranes, etc., as abundant, and remaining in
the country through the winter. The winter was shorter and milder than "in Canada." No snow
had fallen by the 22nd November. The deepest was not more than two and a half feet. Thaw set
in on the 26th of January. On the 8th March the snow was gone from the open places, but a little
still lingered in the woods. The streams abounded in very good fish. The ground produced more
corn than was needed, besides pumpkins, beans and other vegetables in abundance, and excellent
oil. He expresses his surprise that the Merchants' Company had not sent some Frenchman to winter
in the Country: for it would be very easy to get the Neutrals to trade and the direct route
would be much shorter than that by way of French River and the Georgian Bay. He describes the
Neutrals' country as being nearer than the Huron to the French, and as being on one side of
the lake of the Iroquois (Lake Ontario) whilst the Iroquois were on the other. The Neutrals,
however, did not understand the management of canoes, especially in the rapids, of which there
were only two, but long and dangerous. Their proper trade was hunting and war. They were very
lazy and immoral. Their manners and customs were very much the same as those of the Hurons.
Their language was different, but the members of the two nations understood one another. They
went entirely unclad.

Sagard adds that "according to the opinion of some," the Neutrals' country was eighty leagues
(about 200 miles) in extent, and that they raised very good tobacco which they traded with
their neighbors. They were called Neutrals on account of their neutrality between the Hurons
and the Iroquois; but they were allies of the Cheveux Releves (the Ottawas) against their mortal
enemies of the Nation of Fire. Sagard was dissuaded by some members of the French trading company
from attempting to bring about a peace between the Hurons and the Iroquois. It was supposed
that this would divert the trade of the Hurons from Quebec by sending it through the Iroquois
country to the Dutch of the Hudson River. At so early a date did the question of closer trade
relations between the territories north and south of the lakes agitate the minds of statesmen
and men of commerce.

In the winter of 1640-1, the Jesuit missionaries, Brebeuf and Chaumonot traversed the country
of the Neutrals. The former composed a dictionary showing the differences between the kindred
dialects of the Hurons and Neutrals. Chaumonot made a map of the country, which is not extant,
but there is reason for believing that it was the authority for the delineation of the territory
on Sanson's map of 1656 and Ducreux's Latin map of 1660. From the facts hereinafter detailed
it is highly probable that they reached the Detroit River, and that they visited and named
the Neutral village of which the Southwold Earthwork is the memorial. The first printed map
in which Lake Erie is shown was made by N. Sanson d'Abbeville, geographer in ordinary to the
King, and printed in Paris, with "privilege du Roy" for twenty years, in the year 1656. It
is a map of eastern North America. The sources of information are stated in general terms,
which may be translated as follows: "The most northerly portion is drawn from the various Relations
of the English, Danes, etc. Towards the south the coasts of Virginia, New Sweden, New Netherlands
and New England are drawn from those of the English, Dutch, etc. THE GREAT RIVER OF CANADA,
or of St. Lawrence and all the neighboring regions (environs) are according to the Relations
of the French."

Now, we know that Father Raymbault visited Sault Ste. Marie in 1641 and mapped Lake Superior,
and that Father Chaumonot in the same year rendered the same service for the Neutral Country.
Sanson's map is fairly accurate for the upper lakes, when compared with some maps published
at much later periods when the lakes had become tolerably well known to traders and travellers.
It shows an acquaintance with the general contour of Lakes Erie, St. Clair and Huron, with
several of the streams emptying into Lakes Erie and Huron on both the Canadian and the American
sides, with the names of tribes inhabiting both shores, and with the locations of five towns
of the Neutrals, besides some towns of the Tobacco Nation. The Neutral towns are given as S.
Francois, (north-east of Sarnia) S. Michel, (a little east of Sandwich), S. Joseph, (apparently
in the county of Kent), Alexis, (a few miles west of a stream, which flows into Lake Erie about
midway between the Detroit and Niagara Rivers, and where the shore bends farthest inland),[2]
and N. D. des Anges (on the West bank of a considerable river, probably the Grand River, near
where Brantford now stands). The Detroit and Niagara Rivers and four streams flowing into Lake
Erie between them are shown but not named. The great cataract is called "Ongiara Sault." The
name Ongiara may, however, be that of the Neutral village east of the Falls. Lake St. Clair
is called Lac des Eaux de Mer, or Sea-water Lake, possibly from the mineral springs in the
neighborhood. The country of the Tobacco Nation includes the Bruce peninsula and extends from
the Huron country on the east to Lake Huron on the west, and Burlington Bay on the southeast.
The Neutral Country (Neutre ou Attiouandarons) would embrace the whole of southwestern Ontario
south of a line drawn from the west end of Lake Ontario to a stream which flows into Lake Huron
about midway between Point Edward and Cape Hurd, and which is probably the Maitland River.
The tribes to the south of the lakes are indicated from the Niagara River to Lake Superior.
The Eries or "Eriechronons, ou du Chat," are south-east of Lake Erie; the "Ontarraronon" are
west of what is probably the Cuyahoga River; at the southwest of the lake appear the "Squenqioronon;"
west of the Detroit River are the "Aictaeronon;" west of Port Huron the "Couarronon;" Huron
County in Michigan is occupied by the "Ariaetoeronon;" at the head of Saginaw Bay and extending
southward through Michigan are the "Assistaeronons ou du Feu;" in the peninsula extending north
to Mackinac are the "Oukouarararonons;" beyond them Lake Michigan appears as "Lac de Puans;"
then come the northern peninsula and "Lac Superieur." Manitoulin Island is marked "Cheveux
Releves;" the old French name for the Ottawas. The Tobacco Nation called "N. du Petun on Sanhionontateheronons"
includes villages of "S. Simon et S. Iude" in the Bruce promontory, "S. Pierre" near the south
end of the County of Bruce, and "S. Pol," southwest of a lake which may be Scugog.

      [2] Alexis corresponds with the actual position of the Southwold
      Earthwork, and the stream with that of Kettle Creek.

To return to the narratives, these agree in stating that the Neutrals, like their kinsmen of
the Huron, Tobacco and Iroquois Nations, were a numerous and sedentary race living in villages
and cultivating their fields of maize, tobacco and pumpkins. They were on friendly terms with
the eastern and northern tribes, but at enmity with those of the west, especially the Nation
of Fire, against whom they were constantly sending out war parties. By the western tribes it
would appear that those west of the Detroit River and Lake Huron are invariably meant.

Champlain refers to the Neutrals in 1616 as a powerful nation, holding a large extent of country,
and numbering 4,000 warriors. Already they were in alliance with the Cheveux Releves (the Ottawas),
whom he visited in the Bruce Peninsula, against the Nation of Fire. He states that the Neutrals
lived two days' journey southward of the Cheveux Releves, and the Nation of Fire ten days from
the latter. The Nation of Fire occupied part of what is now Michigan, probably as far east
as the Detroit and St. Clair Rivers.

Describing his visit to the Cheveux Releves, he adds:--"I had a great desire to go and see
that Nation (the Neutrals), had not the tribes where we were dissuaded me from it, saying that
the year before one of ours had killed one of them, being at war with the Entouhoronons (the
Senecas), and that they were angry on account of it, representing to us that they are very
subject to vengeance, not looking to those who dealt the blow, but the first whom they meet
of the nation, or even their friends, they make them bear the penalty, when they can catch
any of them unless beforehand peace had been made with them, and one had given them some gifts
and presents for the relatives of the deceased; which prevented me for the time from going
there, although some of that nation assured us that they would do us no harm for that. This
decided us, and occasioned our returning by the same road as we had come, and continuing my
journey, I found the nation of the Pisierinij etc."

    NOTE.--This is a literal translation, and shows the crudity of
    Champlain's sailor style of composition.

Brebeuf, who reckoned the Hurons at more than 30,000, describes the Neutrals in 1634 as much
more numerous than the former. The Relation of 1641 gives them at least 12,000, but adds that
notwithstanding the wars, famine and disease (small pox), which since three years had prevailed
in an extraordinary degree, the country could still furnish 4,000 warriors, the exact number
estimated by Champlain a quarter of a century earlier. The name of the Neutrals is variously
given as Attikadaron, Atiouandaronk, Attiouandaron, Attiwandaronk, but the last is the more
common. The name signified "people who spoke a slightly different dialect," and the Hurons
were known to the Neutrals by the same name. The latter are mentioned in the Relations as one
of the twelve numerous and sedentary nations who spoke a common language with the Hurons. The
Oueanohronons formed "one of the nations associated with the Neutral Nation." They are afterwards
called in the same Relation (1639) the Wenrohronons, and are said to have lived on the borders
of the Iroquois, more than eighty leagues from the Huron country. So long as they were on friendly
terms with the Neutrals they were safe from the dreaded Iroquois; but a misunderstanding having
arisen between them, they were obliged to flee in order to avoid extermination by the latter.
They took refuge, more than 600 in all, with the Hurons, and were received in the most friendly
and hospitable manner.

The Relation of 1640 speaks of a Huron map communicated by Father Paul Ragueneau in which a
large number of tribes, most of them acquainted with the Huron language, are shown, including
the Iroquois, the Neutrals, the Eries, etc. The "Mission of the Apostles" was established among
the Tobacco Nation by Garnier and Jogues in 1640. Nine villages visited by them were endowed
by the missionaries with the names of apostles, two of which are given in Sanson's map of 1656.[3]
In one "bourg" called S. Thomas, they baptized a boy five years old belonging to the Neutral
Nation, who died immediately afterwards. "He saw himself straightway out of banishment and
happy in his own country." The famine had driven his parents to the village of the Tobacco
Nation. The devoted missionaries add that this was the first fruits of the Neutral nation.

      [3] The principal "bourg" was Ehwae, surnamed S. Pierre et S.
      Paul. If S. Pierre on Sanson's map is the same place, this most
      have been near the southern end of the county of Bruce. The other
      village or mission shown on the map is S. Simon et S. Iude.

In the fall of the same year "The Mission of the Angels" was begun among the Neutrals. The
lot fell upon Jean de Brebeuf and Joseph Marie Chaumonot. The former was the pioneer of the
Jesuit Mission. He had spent three years among the Hurons from 1626 to 1629, and, after the
restoration of Canada to the French by Charles I., he had returned in 1634 to the scene of
his earlier labors. His associate had only come from France the year before. Brebeuf was distinguished
for his mastery of the native tongues, and Chaumonot had been recognized as an apt student
of languages. The plan of the Jesuits was to establish in the new mission a fixed and permanent
residence, which should be the "retreat" of the missionaries of the surrounding country, as
Ste. Marie was of those of the Huron mission.

Lalemant from their report describes the Neutral Nation as exceedingly populous, including
about forty villages ("bourgs ou bourgades.") The nearest villages were four or five days'
journey or about forty leagues (100 miles) distant from the Hurons, going due south. He estimates
the difference in latitude between Ste. Marie and the nearest village of the Neutrals to the
south at about 1°55'. Elsewhere the distance is spoken of as about thirty leagues.

From the first "bourg," going on to the south or south-west (a mistake for south-east it would
seem,) it was about four days' journey to the mouth of the Niagara River. On this side of the
river, and not beyond it, as "some map" lays it down, (Champlain's, doubtless,) were most of
the "bourgs" of the Neutral Nation. There were three or four on the other side towards the
Eries. Lalemant claims, and there is no doubt as to the fact, that the French were the first
Europeans to become acquainted with the Neutrals. The Hurons and Iroquois were sworn enemies
to each other, but in a wigwam or even a camp of the Neutrals until recently each had been
safe from the other's vengeance.

Latterly however the unbridled fury of the hostile nations had not respected even the neutral
ground of their mutual friends. Friendly as they were to the Hurons and Iroquois, the Neutrals
engaged in cruel wars with other nations to the west, particularly the Nation of Fire, as has
been stated above. The previous year a hundred prisoners had been taken from the latter tribe.
This year, returning with 2,000 warriors, the Neutrals had carried off more than 170. Fiercer
than the Hurons, they burned their female prisoners. Their clothing and mode of living differed
but little from those of the Hurons. They had Indian corn, beans and pumpkins in equal abundance.
Fish were abundant, different species being met with in different places. The country was a
famous hunting ground. Elk, deer, wild cats, wolves, "black beasts" (squirrels), beaver and
other animals valuable for their skins and flesh; were in abundance. It was a rare thing to
see more than half a foot of snow. This year there was more than three feet. The deep snow
had facilitated the hunting, and, in happy contrast with the famine which had prevailed, meat
was plentiful. They had also multitudes of wild turkeys which went in flocks through the fields
and woods. Fruits were no more plentiful than amongst the Hurons, except that chestnuts abounded,
and wild apples were a little larger.

Their manners and customs, and family and political government, were very much like those of
the other Indian tribes, but they were distinguished from the Hurons by their greater dissoluteness
and indecency. On the other hand they were taller, stronger and better formed.

Their burial customs were peculiar, although similar customs are reported at this day amongst
some African tribes. The bodies remained in their wigwams until decomposition rendered them
insupportable, when they were put outside on a scaffold. Soon afterward, the bones were removed
and arranged within their houses on both sides in sight of the inmates, where they remained
until the feast of the dead. Having these mournful objects before their eyes, the women habitually
indulged in cries and laments, in a kind of chant.

The Neutrals were distinguished for the multitude and quality of their madmen, who were a privileged
class. Hence it was common for bad Indians to assume the character of maniacs in order to perpetrate
crimes without fear of punishment. The Jesuits suffered very much from their malice. Some old
men told them that the Neutrals used to carry on war "towards" a certain western nation, who
would seem to have lived on the Gulf of Mexico, where the "porcelain, which are the pearls
of the country," was obtained from a kind of oysters. It is an undoubted fact that a traffic
was carried on with tribes as far south as the Gulf of Mexico, from whom shells used for wampum
were obtained by successive interchanges of commodities with intervening tribes. They had also
some vague notion of alligators, which are apparently referred to by the description, "certain
aquatic animals, larger and swifter than elk," against which these same people had "a kind
of war," the details of which are somewhat amusing, as given by Lalemant.

The two Jesuits left Ste. Marie the 2nd November, 1640, with two French servants (probably
"donnes,") and an Indian. They slept four nights in the woods. The fifth day they arrived at
the first village ("bourg") of the Neutral Nation called Kandoucho, but to which they gave
the name of All Saints. This is probably the same as N. D. des Anges on Sanson's map, and was
not far perhaps from the site of Brantford.

Owing to the unfavorable reports which had been spread through the country about the Jesuits,
the latter were anxious to explain their purposes to a council of the chiefs and old men. The
head chief, "who managed the affairs of the public" was called Tsohahissen (doubtless the same
as Daillon's Souharissen). His "bourg" was "in the middle of the country;" to reach it, one
had to pass through several other villages ("bourgs et bourgades.") In Sanson's map, Alexis
is placed almost exactly "in the middle of the country" of the Neutrals. No other village is
marked on the map, to which the expression could be applied. Its situation nearly midway between
the Detroit & Niagara Rivers, a few miles west of a stream which flows into Lake Erie just
where the mouth of Kettle Creek would appear in a map of our own century, corresponds with
that of the Southwold earthwork. Was the latter the Neutrals' capital? We can only conjecture;
but the evidence of the Relations, the map and the forest growth, all points to an affirmative
answer. There is a strong probability that it was here Tsohahissen reigned (if the expression
is allowable in reference to an Indian potentate) as head chief of the forty Neutral villages.
Through the western gate, doubtless, his warriors set out to wage their relentless warfare
against the Nation of Fire. Within these mounds, returning satiated with blood, they celebrated
their savage triumph, adorned with the scalps of their enemies.

Brebeuf's Huron surname "Echon" had preceded him. He was regarded as "one of the most famous
sorcerers and demons ever imagined." Several Frenchmen had travelled through the country before
him, purchasing furs and other commodities. These had smoothed the way for the Jesuits. Under
the pretext of being traders, Brebeuf's party succeeded in making their way in spite of all
obstacles interposed. They arrived at the head-chief's village, only to find that he had gone
on a war party and would not return until spring. The missionaries sought to negotiate with
those who administered affairs in his absence. They desired to publish the Gospel throughout
these lands, "and thereby to contract a particular alliance with them." In proof of their desire,
they had brought a necklace of two thousand grains of "porcelain" or wampum which they wished
to present to "the Public." The inferior chiefs refused to bind themselves in any way by accepting
the present, but gave the missionaries leave, if they would wait until the chief of the country
returned, to travel freely and give such instruction as they pleased. Nothing could have suited
the fathers better. First however they decided to return in their steps and reconduct their
domestics out of the country. Then they would resume their journey for the second time, and
"begin their function." As it had been the servants however, who had acted the part of traders,
this pretext was now wanting to the Jesuits. They suffered everywhere from the malicious reports
which had been circulated as to their purposes in visiting the nation and the acts of sorcery
with which they were charged. The Hurons of the Georgian Bay alarmed for the monopoly they
had hitherto enjoyed and jealous of the French traders, had sent emissaries amongst the Neutrals
to poison their minds against the adventurous travellers, by the most extraordinary calumnies.

For these reports two Huron Indians Aouenhokoui and Oentara were especially responsible. They
had visited several villages, presented hatchets in the name of the Huron chiefs and old men,
and denounced their white visitors as sorcerers who desired to destroy the Neutrals by means
of presents. These representations were so effectual that a council was at length held by the
chiefs and the present formally refused, although permission to preach was granted.

From village to village they passed, but everywhere the doors were barred to them. Hostile
looks greeted them wherever they went. No sooner did they approach a village than the cry resounded
on all sides "Here come the Agwa." This was the name given by the natives to their greatest
enemies. If the priests were admitted into their dwellings at all, it was more frequently from
fear of the "sorcerers'" vengeance than for the hope of gain, "God making use of everything
in order to nourish his servants."

In the graphic language of Lalemant: "The mere sight of the fathers, in figure and habit so
different from their own, their gait, their gestures and their whole deportment seemed to them
so many confirmations of what had been told them. The breviaries, ink-stands and writings were
instruments of magic; if the Frenchmen prayed to God, it was according to their idea simply
an exercise of sorcerers. Going to the stream to wash their dishes, it was said they were poisoning
the water: it was charged that through all the cabins, wherever the priests passed, the children
were seized with a cough and bloody flux, and the women became barren. In short, there was
no calamity present or to come, of which they were not considered as the source. Several of
those with whom the fathers took up their abode did not sleep day or night for fear; they dared
not touch what had been handled by them, they returned the strangers' presents, regarding everything
as suspicious. The good old women already regarded themselves as lost, and only regretted the
fate of their little children, who might otherwise have been able to repeople the earth."

The Neutrals intimidated the fathers with rumors of the Senecas, who they were assured were
not far off. They spoke of killing and eating the missionaries. Yet in the four months of their
sojourn Brebeuf and Chaumonot never lacked the necessaries of life, lodging and food, and amidst
difficulties and inconveniences better imagined than described they retained their health.
Their food supply was bread baked under ashes after the fashion of the country, and which they
kept for thirty and even forty days to use in case of need.

"In their journey, the fathers passed through eighteen villages (bourgs ou bourgades), to all
of which they gave a Christian name, of which we shall make use hereafter on occasion. They
stayed particularly in ten, to which they gave as much instruction as they could find hearers.
They report about 500 Fires and 3,000 persons, which these ten bourgades may contain, to whom
they set forth and published the Gospel." (Lalemant's Relation.)[4]

      [4] In another place it is stated that there were 40 villages of
      the Neutrals in all.

Disheartened, the fathers decided to return to Kandoucho or All Saints to await the spring.
Midway, however, at the village of Teotongniaton, or S. Guillaume, (perhaps in the vicinity
of Woodstock) the snow fell in such quantities that further progress was impossible. They lodged
here in the cabin of a squaw, who entertained them hospitably and instructed them in the language,
dictating narratives syllable by syllable as to a school boy. Here they stayed twenty-five
days, "adjusted the dictionary and rules of the Huron language to that of these tribes (the
Neutrals), and accomplished a work which alone was worth a journey of several years in the
country."

Hurons from the mission of La Conception volunteered to go to the relief of the daring travellers.
After eight days of travel and fatigue in the woods the priests and the relief party arrived
at Ste. Marie on the very day of St. Joseph, patron of the country, in time to say mass, which
they had not been able to say since their departure.

Amongst the eighteen villages visited by them, only one, that of Khioetoa, called by the fathers
Saint Michel, gave them the audience their embassy merited. In this village, years before,
driven by fear of their enemies, had taken refuge a certain foreign nation, "which lived beyond
Erie or the Cat Nation," named Aouenrehronon. It was in this nation that the fathers performed
the first baptism of adults. These were probably a portion of the kindred Neutral tribe referred
to above as having fled to the Huron country from the Iroquois. Their original home was in
the State of New York. Sanson's map shows S. Michel a little east of where Sandwich now stands.

Owing to their scanty number and the calumnies circulated amongst the Indians respecting the
Jesuits of the Huron Mission the latter resolved to concentrate their forces. The Neutral mission
was abandoned, but Christian Indians visited the Neutrals in 1643 and spread the faith amongst
them with a success which elicits Lalemant's enthusiastic praises. Towards the end of the following
winter a band of about 500 Neutrals visited the Hurons. The fathers did not fail to avail themselves
of their opportunity. The visitors were instructed in the faith and expressed their regret
that their teachers could not return with them. A different reception from that experienced
by Brebeuf and Chaumonot three years before was promised.

Lalemant relates that in the summer of 1643, 2,000 Neutrals invaded the country of the Nation
of Fire and attacked a village strongly fortified with a palisade, and defended stoutly by
900 warriors. After a ten days' siege, they carried it by storm, killed a large number on the
spot, and carried off 800 captives, men, women and children, after burning 70 of the most warlike
and blinding the eyes and "girdling the mouths" of the old men, whom they left to drag out
a miserable existence. He reports the Nation of Fire as more populous than the Neutrals, the
Hurons and the Iroquois together. In a large number of these villages the Algonkin language
was spoken. Farther away, it was the prevailing tongue. In remote Algonkin tribes, even at
that early day, there were Christians who knelt, crossed their hands, turned their eyes heavenward,
and prayed to God morning and evening, and before and after their meals; and the best mark
of their faith was that they were no longer wicked nor dishonest as they were before. So it
was reported to Lalemant by trustworthy Hurons who went every year to trade with Algonkin nations
scattered over the whole northern part of the continent.

Ragueneau in the Relation of 1648 refers to Lake Erie as being almost 200 leagues in circuit,
and precipitating itself by "a waterfall of a terrible height" into Lake Ontario, or Lake Saint
Louys.

The Aondironnons a tribe of the Neutrals living nearest to the Hurons were treacherously attacked
in their village by 300 Senecas, who after killing a number carried as many as possible away
with them as prisoners. The Neutrals showed no open resentment but quietly prepared to revenge
themselves. A Christian Huron, a girl of fifteen, taken prisoner by the Senecas, escaped from
them and made her way to the Neutral country, where she met four men, two of whom were Neutrals
and the others enemies. The latter wished to take her back to captivity; but the Neutrals,
claiming that within their country she was no longer in the power of her enemies, rescued her
and she returned in safety to Ste. Marie on the Georgian Bay. These incidents were the prelude
to the storm which shortly afterward burst.

In 1650 the principal part of the Iroquois forces was directed against the Neutrals. They carried
two frontier villages, in one of which were more than 1600 men, the first at the end of autumn,
the second early in the spring of 1651. The old men and children who might encumber them on
their homeward journey were massacred. The number of captives was excessive, especially of
young women, who were carried off to the Iroquois towns. The other more distant villages were
seized with terror. The Neutrals abandoned their houses, their property and their country.
Famine pursued them. The survivors became scattered amongst far-off woods and along unknown
lakes and rivers. In wretchedness and want and in constant apprehension of their relentless
enemy, they eked out a miserable existence.

The Journal (April 22, 1651) adds that after the destruction of the Neutral village in the
previous autumn, the Neutral warriors under the lead of the Tahontaenrat (a Huron tribe) had
followed the assailants and killed or taken 200 of them; and 1,200 Iroquois warriors had returned
in the spring to avenge this disaster. In August a Huron reported at Montreal the capture of
Teot'ondiaton (probably the village in which Brebeuf composed his dictionary, and which is
referred to in the Relation as having been taken in the spring). The condition of the Neutrals
was desolate and desperate. In April, 1652, news reached Quebec that they had leagued with
the Andastes against the Iroquois, that the Senecas had been defeated in a foray against the
Neutrals, so that the Seneca women had been constrained to quit their village and retreat to
the Oneida country; also that the Mohawks had gone on the war path against the Andastes during
the winter, and the issue of the war was unknown. The last of July, 1653, seven Indians from
the Huron country arrived at Quebec and reported a great gathering near Mackinac of all the
Algonkin nations with the remains of the Tobacco and Neutral Nations at A'otonatendie three
days above the Sault Ste. Marie (Skia'e) towards the south. The Tobacco Indians had wintered
at Tea'onto'rai; the Neutrals to the number of 800 at Sken'chio'e towards Teo'chanontian. These
were to rendezvous the next fall with the Algonkins, who were already on the spot to the number
of 1,000.

This is probably the last we hear of the Neutrals under their own name. Some of the survivors
united with the remnant of the Hurons at Mackinac and on Lake Superior; and under the name
of the Hurons and Wyandots they appear from time to time on the page of history. Thus they were force

 Marquette, Tonty, Hennepin, Du Lhut, La Salle and Perrot explored
the Mississippi valley, and the head waters of the St. Lawrence system, and almost the entire
continent was claimed by the French as belonging to New France. As far as appears, there were
no Indians having settled abodes on the north shore of Lake Erie for more than a century after
the expulsion of the Neutrals. Nor does any attempt appear to have been made by the whites
to explore south-western Ontario until the close of the last century. The Iroquois continued
for a long period to range its forests for beaver in the winter. The rivalry between the French
and the English for the control of the vast western fur trade led to the erection of outposts
by the English at Oswego and by the French at Cataraqui, Niagara, Detroit and Michilimakinac,
during the latter part of the 17th century. English traders sailed or paddled up the lakes
to get their share of the traffic, and were from time to time summarily arrested and expelled
by their rivals. Both parties tried to ingratiate themselves with the natives. The French were
as eager to maintain a state of warfare between the Iroquois and the Indians of the upper Lakes--the
Hurons, Ottawas, Pottawatamies, Ojibways etc.--as to induce the former to keep the peace with
the white inhabitants of Canada. There were two great trade routes to Montreal, viz: by Mackinac,
the Georgian Bay and the French and Ottawa River and by Detroit, Lake Erie and Niagara; the
Lake Simcoe portage routes by the Trent River system, and the Holland River and Toronto were
also used. Trading or military parties, under the leadership of La Salle, Tonty, Perrot, Du
Lhut, Cadaillac, passed along the coast of L. Erie in canoes; but little record if any remained
of their visits to the shores. Kettle Creek was long called the Tonty River. It is so named
in one of Bellin's maps of 1755, and by the Canadian Land Board at Detroit as lately as 1793.
The only northern tributaries of Lake Erie to which names are given on the map of 1755 are
the Grand River, River D'Ollier (Patterson's Creek), which in some maps is called the River
of the Wintering--a manifest reference to Galinee and Dollier de Casson's sojourn in 1669-70--the
River a la Barbue (Catfish Creek), the River Tonty (Kettle Creek) a little east of P'te au
Fort (Plum Point or else Port Talbot) and the River aux Cedres (M'Gregor's Creek in Essex).
The Thames is described as a "River unknown to all geographers, and which you go up eighty
leagues without finding any rapids (saults)." The Chenail Ecarte is indicated as the only outlet
of the Sydenham river the map-makers assuming that Walpole Island was part of the mainland.
The mouths of four or five streams are shown between Long Point and "the Little Lake" (Rondeau),
and the shore is marked "The High Cliffs." "The Low Cliffs" were between the Rondeau and Point
Pelee. In one of Bellin's maps of 1755 in the present writer's possession Long Point is shown
as a peninsula, and the streams now in the County of Elgin are marked "Unknown Rivers," but
the map firstly mentioned and published in the same year, is more complete, represents Long
Point as an island, and names the Barbue and Tonty rivers and Fort Point, (P'te au Fort) which
are not named in the other. The Tonty, moreover, is represented as an inlet by way of distinction
from the other streams (including the Barbue) which appear as of equal insignificance. The
naming of Kettle Creek after the great explorer and devoted lieutenant of La Salle indicates
its consequence. Its harbor was of paramount importance to the navigation of these early days,
but no doubt the portage route extending from its mouth to the Thames, exalted the little river
in the eyes of the explorers who honored it with Tonty's name.[9]

      [9] General John S. Clarke, of Auburn, N.Y., in correspondence
      with the present writer, dwells upon the importance of the Kettle
      Creek portage route in the seventeenth century. He is a
      recognized authority upon the subject of Indian trade routes.

THE INDIAN TITLE.

On July 19th, 1701, the Iroquois ceded to the British the entire country between the lakes,
"including the country where beavers and all sorts of wild game keep, and the place called
De Tret,"[10] but this appears to have been a mere formality as no possession was taken by
the purchasers.

      [10] History of Middlesex County, p. 17.

The Ojibways have a tradition that they defeated the Iroquois (called by them the Nottawas
or Nahdoways) in a succession of skirmishes, ending in a complete victory at the outlet of
Burlington Bay, and the final expulsion of the Six Nations from that part of Ontario between
the Great Lakes. The Ojibways then spread east and west over the country. "A treaty of peace
and friendship was then made with the Nahdoways residing on the south side of Lake Ontario,
and both nations solemnly covenanted, by going through the usual forms of burying the tomahawk,
smoking the pipe of peace, and locking their hands and arms together, agreeing in future to
call each other Brothers. Thus ended their war with the Nahdoways."[11]

      [11] "Peter Jones and the Ojebway Indians," p. 113.

Whatever may be the truth of the details, there is no doubt of the fact that the Ojibways or
their kindred the Mississagas were the sole occupants of Western Ontario at the time of the
conquest in 1759, except near the Detroit River where the remnant of the Hurons or Wyandots
had settled. It was with the Mississagas that the British negotiated in 1784 for the cession
of the country from the "head of the Lake Ontario or the Creek Waghguata to the River La Tranche,
then down the river until a south course will strike the mouth of Cat Fish Creek on Lake Erie."
On the 21st May, 1790, Alexander M'Kee announced to the Land-board at Detroit the cession to
the Crown by the Indians of that part of Upper Canada west of the former grant. The surrender
of the Indian title opened the way in each division of the lake shore district for settlement.[12]

    NOTE.--The explanatory notes referring to the extract are by the
    late Leonidas Burwell, M.P.P., and are given by him in a letter to
    His Honor, Judge Hughes, which has been kindly presented by the
    recipient to the Elgin Historical and Scientific Institute.

      [12] The north shore of Lake Erie appears to have been so little
      known to the officials, that Kettle Creek and Cat Fish Creek were
      continually confused and taken as being one or different streams
      as chance would have it. The Land-board considered that a
      surrender of the lands west of Kettle Creek gave the Crown all
      the territory not previously ceded. The Indians at Detroit who
      made the cession were the Ojibways, Hurons, Ottawas and
      Pottawatamies.

CHARLEVOIX'S DESCRIPTION.

In the year 1721 the distinguished traveller, Charlevoix, passed through Lake Erie on his way
up the Lakes and thence down the Mississippi to New Orleans. The north shore of Lake Erie,
and chiefly that part now embraced within the limits of the County of Elgin, is singled out
by him as the most beautiful country he met with in his passage. Many travellers since Charlevoix
have admired the charming scenery at the mouths of Otter, Catfish, Kettle and Talbot Creeks,
but few if any have described it so well. As Colonel Talbot was influenced mainly by Charlevoix's
description of the country to establish his settlement at the outlet of Talbot Creek in 1803,
the present writer makes no apology for reproducing the following extended passage from the
celebrated and gifted traveller:

"The 28th May, 1721, I went eighteen leagues and found myself over against the great river
which comes from the East in forty-two degrees fifteen minutes. Nevertheless the great trees
were not yet green. This country appeared to me to be very fine. We made very little way the
29th and none at all the 30th. We embarked the next day about sun rise, and went forward apace.
The first of June being Whitsunday, after going up a pretty river almost an hour which comes
a great way, and runs between two fine meadows, we made a portage about sixty paces to escape
going round a point which advances fifteen leagues into the lake: they call it the Long Point.
It is very sandy and produces naturally many vines."[13]

      [13] This river is what is now known as "Big Creek" and, answers
      this description at the present day. It enters the lake a little
      above Fort Rowan.

"The following days I saw nothing remarkable, but I coasted a charming country that was hid
from time to time by some disagreeable skreens, but of little depth. In every place where I
landed I was enchanted with the beauty and variety of landscape bounded by the finest forest
in the world; besides this water fowl swarmed everywhere. I cannot say there is such plenty
of game in the woods: but I know that on the south side there are vast herds of wild cattle."[14]

      [14] This charming country is evidently, the greater part of it,
      the County of Elgin, as the portage is not more than thirteen
      miles from the boundary line of Bayham. In passing up the lake
      one would meet with a great variety of landscape as the
      sand-hills in Houghton and the mouths of the Otter, Catfish and
      other creeks would be passed. The lofty pines and chestnuts and
      oaks along this coast, in their original state no doubt appeared
      like the "finest forest in the world."

"If one always travelled as I did then, with a clear sky and charming climate on water as bright
as the finest fountain, and were to meet everywhere with safe and pleasant encampings, where
one might find all manner of game at little cost, breathing at one's ease a pure air, and enjoying
the sight of the finest countries, one would be tempted to travel all one's life."

"It put me in mind of those ancient patriarchs who had no fixed abode, dwelt under tents, were
in some manner master of all the countries they travelled over, and peaceably enjoyed all their
productions without having the trouble which is inavoidable in the possession of a real domain.
How many oaks represented to me that of Mamre? How many fountains made me remember that of
Jacob? Every day a situation of my own choosing, a neat and convenient house set up and furnished
with necessaries in a quarter of an hour, spread with flowers always fresh, on a fine green
carpet, and on every side plain and natural beauties which art had not altered and which it
can not imitate. If the pleasures suffer some interruption either by bad weather or some unforseen
accident, they are the more relished when they reappear."

"If I had a mind to moralize, I should add, these alternations of pleasure and disappointment
which I have so often experienced since I have been travelling, are very proper to make us
sensible that there is no kind of life more capable of representing to us continually that
we are only on the earth like pilgrims, and that we can only use, as in passing, the goods
of this world; that a man wants but a few things; and that we ought to take with patience the
misfortunes that happen in our journey, since they pass away equally, and with the same celerity.
In short how many things in travelling make us sensible of the dependence in which we live
upon Divine providence, which does not make use of, for this mixture of good and evil, men's
passions, but the vicissitudes of the seasons which we may foresee, and of the caprice of the
elements, which we may expect of course. He started accordingly rifle who has effectually when no finding-air

 As early as January,
1791, he had written a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society,[16] in which
after mentioning his appointment, he explained his own plans as to the administration, and
stated his desire to profit by the ideas of his correspondent whom he would wait upon for that
purpose.

      Lands Department at Toronto.

"For the purpose of commerce, union and power, I propose that the site of the colony should
be in that Great Peninsula between the Lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario, a spot destined by nature,
sooner or later, to govern the interior world."

"I mean to establish a capital in the very heart of the country, upon the River La Tranche,
which is navigable for batteauxs for 150 miles--and near to where the Grand River, which falls
into Erie, and others that communicate with Huron and Ontario almost interlock. The capital
I mean to call Georgina--and aim to settle in its vicinity Loyalists, who are now in Connecticut,
provided that the Government approve of the system."

As a member of the House of Commons, Simcoe spoke in support of a provision in the bill for
the establishment of an hereditary nobility, which Fox had moved to strike out. The provision
was in the bill as finally passed.

Having proceeded to Quebec to enter upon the performance of his duties, he appears to have
utilized every opportunity for informing himself of his new domain. He writes to Hon. Henry
Dundas from Montreal, December 7, 1791, in a letter marked "secret and confidential," as follows:--

    "I am happy to have found in the surveyor's office an actual survey
    of the River La Tranche. It answers my most sanguine expectations,
    and I have but little doubt that its communications with the Ontario
    and Erie will be found to be very practicable, the whole forming a
    route which, in all respects, may annihilate the political
    consequences of Niagara and Lake Erie.  *  *  *  My ideas at present
    are to assemble the new corps, artificers, etc., at Cataraqui
    (Kingston), and to take its present garrison and visit Toronto and
    the heads of La Tranche, to pass down that river to Detroit, and
    early in the spring to occupy such a central position as shall be
    previously chosen for the capital."

On the 16th July, 1792, the name of the River La Tranche was changed to the Thames by proclamation
of the Governor, issued at Kingston. In the spring, he had written that "Toronto appears to
be the natural arsenal of Lake Ontario and to afford an easy access overland to Lake Huron."
He adds: "The River La Tranche, near the navigable head of which I propose to establish the
Capital, by what I can gather from the few people who have visited it, will afford a safe,
more certain, and I am inclined to think, by taking due advantage of the season, a less expensive
route to Detroit than that of Niagara."

At Quebec Simcoe had met the Hon. Thomas Talbot, who had joined the 24th Regiment as Lieutenant
in the previous year. Talbot was then a young man of twenty, whilst Simcoe was in his fortieth
year. A strong attachment sprang up between these two remarkable men, and Talbot accompanied
the lieutenant-governor to Niagara, in the capacity of private and confidential secretary.
After meeting the first Legislature elected in Upper Canada during the fall of 1792 Simcoe
decided to make a journey overland to Detroit. He left Navy Hall on the 4th February, 1793,
and returned on the 10th March. His travelling companions were Capt. Fitzgerald, Lieutenant
Smith (previously Secretary to the Detroit Land Board, subsequently the first Surveyor General
of Upper Canada, an M.P.P., Speaker of the House, etc., and afterward created a baronet), Lieutenants
Talbot, Gray, Givens and Major Littlehales. All of these were prominent afterward in the history
of the Province. Talbot became the founder of the Talbot Settlement. Gray was appointed Solicitor
General; he perished in the schooner 'Speedy' on Lake Ontario in 1804 with Judge Cochrane,
Sheriff Macdonell and others. Givens was afterward the well-known Colonel Givens, Superintendant
of Indian Affairs at York. Littlehales was afterward Sir E. B. Littlehales, Secretary of War
for Ireland, during the Lord-Lieutenancy of the Marquis of Cornwallis; he married in 1805 the
Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald, daughter of the Duke of Leinster and sister of the unfortunate Lord
Edward Fitzgerald.[17]

      [17] Dr. Scadding's notes to his reprint of Littlehales' Journal.

The journey was made partly in sleighs, but chiefly on foot. Littlehales kept a diary of the
occurrences on the way. The route was by Ten-mile Creek, Nelles' house at the Grand River,
the Mohawk Indian village (a little below Brantford), the portage route to the Forks of the
Thames (London), and then down or along the River to Detroit. Joseph Brant with about a dozen
of his Indians accompanied the party from the Mohawk Village to Delaware, doubtless to furnish
them with game and guide them over the long portage. The Indians excited admiration by their
skill in constructing wigwams of elm bark to lodge the company. After leaving the Grand River
the trail passed a Mississaga encampment, a trader's house, fine open deer plains, several
beaver dams, "an encampment said to have been Lord Fitzgerald's when on his march to Detroit,
Michilimackinac and the Mississippi," a cedar grove; crossed a small branch of the La Tranche,
and the main branch soon afterwards; "went between an irregular fence of stakes made by the
Indians to intimidate and impede the deer, and facilitate their hunting;" again they crossed
the main branch of the Thames,[18] and "halted to observe a beautiful situation, formed by
a bend of the river--a grove of hemlock and pine, and a large creek. We passed some deep ravines
and made our wigwam by a stream on the brow of a hill, near a spot where Indians were interred.
The burying ground was of earth raised, nearly covered with leaves; and wickered over--adjoining
it was a large pole, with painted hieroglyphics on it denoting the nation, tribes and achievements
of the deceased, either as chiefs, warriors, or hunters." This was on the 13th February. The
food of the party consisted of soup and dried venison, to which squirrel and racoon meat added
variety. Littlehales remarks about the latter: "The three racoons when roasted made us an excellent
supper. Some parts were rancid, but in general the flesh was exceedingly tender and good."
On the 14th they encamped a few miles above the Delaware village. During the day the diarist
had "observed many trees blazed, and various figures of Indians (returning from battle with
scalps) and animals drawn upon them, descriptive of the nations, tribes and number that had
passed. Many of them were well drawn, especially a bison."

      [18] This was no doubt where London now is.

 "Here we separated; and each taking his pack or knapsack on his back, we walked that
night to the Moravian village."

On the 27th the chiefs at the village entertained the party with venison, and dancing, "a ceremony
they never dispense with when any of the King's officers of rank visit their villages."

"28th.--At six we stopped at an old Misissaga hut, upon the south side of the Thames. After
taking some refreshment of salt pork and venison, well cooked by Lieutenant Smith, who superintended
that department, we, as usual, sang God Save the King, and went to rest."

"March 1st.--We set out along the banks of the river; hen, ascending a high hill, quitted our
former path, and directed our course to the northward. A good deal of snow having fallen, and
lying still on the ground, we saw tracks of otters, deer, wolves and bears and other animals
many of which being quite fresh induced the Mohawks to pursue them, but without success. We
walked 14 or 15 miles and twice crossed the river, and a few creeks, upon the ice; once we
came close to a Chippawa hunting camp, opposite to a fine terrace, on the banks of which we
encamped, near a bay.  *  *  *  2nd.--We struck the Thames at one end of a low flat island
enveloped with shrubs and trees; the rapidity and strength of the current were such as to have
forced a channel through the main land, being a peninsula, and to have formed the island. We
walked over a rich meadow, and at its extremity came to the forks of the river.[21] The Governor
wished to examine this situation and its environs: and we therefore remained here all the day.
He judged it to be a situation eminently calculated for the metropolis of Canada. Among many
other essentials, it possesses the following advantages: command of territory,--internal situation,--central
position,--facility of water communication up and down the Thames into Lakes St. Clair, Erie,
Huron and Superior,--navigable for boats to near its source, and for small crafts probably
to the Moravian settlement--to the northward by a small portage to the waters flowing into
Lake Huron--to the south-east by a carrying place into Lake Ontario and the River St. Lawrence;
the soil luxuriantly fertile,--the land rich, and capable of being easily cleared, and soon
put into a state of agriculture,--a pinery upon an adjacent high knoll, and other timber on
the heights, well calculated for the erection of public buildings,--a climate not inferior
to any part of Canada."

      [21] Now the city of London.

"To these natural advantages an object of great consideration is to be added, that the enormous
expenses of the Indian Department would be greatly diminished, if not abolished; the Indians
would, in all probability, be induced to become the carriers of their own peltries, and they
would find a ready, contiguous, commodious, and equitable mart, honorably advantageous to Government,
and the community in general, without their becoming a prey to the monopolizing and unprincipled
trader."

"The young Indians, who had chased a herd of deer in company with Lieutenant Givens, returned
unsuccessful, but brought with them a large porcupine; which was very seasonable, as our provisions
were nearly expended. This animal afforded us a very good repast, and tasted like a pig. The
Newfoundland dog attempted to bite the porcupine, but soon got his mouth filled with the barbed
quills, which gave him exquisite pain. An Indian undertook to extract them, and with much perseverance
plucked them out, one by one, and carefully applied a root or decoction, which speedily healed
the wound."

"Various figures were delineated on trees at the forks of the River Thames, done with charcoal
and vermillion; the most remarkable were the imitations of men with deer's heads."

"We saw a fine eagle on the wing, and two or three large birds, perhaps vultures."

"3rd.--We were glad to leave our wigwam early this morning, it having rained incessantly the
whole night; besides, the hemlock branches on which we slept were wet before they were gathered
for our use.--We first ascended the height at least 120 feet into a continuation of the pinery
already mentioned; quitting that, we came to a beautiful plain with detached clumps of white
oak, and open woods; then crossing a creek running into the south branch of the Thames, we
entered a thick swampy wood, where we were at a loss to discover any track; but in a few minutes
we were released from this dilemma by the Indians, who making a cast, soon descried our old
path to Detroit. Descending a hill and crossing a brook, we came at noon to the encampment
we left on the 14th of February, and were agreeably surprised by meeting Captain Brant and
a numerous retinue; among them were four of the Indians we had despatched to him when we first
altered our course for the forks of the River Thames."

On the 4th, after crossing brooks and rivulets, much swollen by a thunder-storm, and passing
the hut occupied by them on the 12th February they noticed "very fine beech trees."

Next day:--"We again crossed one of the branches of the south-east fork of the Thames, and
halted in a cypress or cedar grove, where we were much amused by seeing Brant and the Indians
chase a lynx with their dogs and rifle guns, but they did not catch it. Several porcupines
were seen."

On the 6th they reached the Mohawk village, crossing the river at a different place and by
a nearer route than before. The Indians had met the Governor with horses at "the end of the
plain, near the Salt Lick Creek." The party finally arrived at Navy Hall on the 10th day of March.

At this period the overland route from Detroit to Niagara was apparently well known. There
was an annual "Winter-express" each way, which Simcoe met on his westward journey on the 12th
February and on his homeward route on the 5th March. Littlehales mentions a Mr. Clarke as being
with it on each occasion. On their first meeting, the express was accompanied by a Wyandot
and a Chippawa Indian. The second time, Mr. Augustus Jones, the surveyor, was either with or
following it. He surveyed the north-west part of Southwold in the following year. On the up
trip, the Governor's party met one man, who afterward proved to be a runaway thief from Detroit.
They were also overtaken by a traveller, who, as they were subsequently informed, had got himself
supplied with provisions and horses to the Grand Rivet, and a guide from thence to Detroit,
by the false representation that he had despatches for the Governor. "He quitted us under the
plausible pretence of looking for land to establish a settlement."

It appears that immediately after the capture of Niagara by Johnston in 1759, merchants from
New England and Virginia had rushed in to participate in the fur-trade, which until that time
had been largely monopolized by the French. As might be expected, many lawless acts were committed
by these adventurers, and various proceedings were adopted by the Government to check and control
them. After the American Revolution land-hunters came into the peninsula and undertook to purchase
lands directly from the Indians. These purchases were ignored by the Land Boards, who always
repudiated the idea that the Indians were proprietors of the land. No steps were taken however
to locate settlers until the Indian title by occupancy was surrendered to the Crown. "today, in khalíf
Mohammed State legislative improvement are equally western. There be the enterprise. The Sultán,
or any can claim the allegiance of his cohort thus merely secular as he remains the political
executor of the direction of the Law."

The question so as detail the politics of the "exact{ 24} question" is not
whether Muhammadan was that bluffer or anima-delude, an apostle or
an impostor; whether a Qurán is on no short impossible or bad; whether
Muhammad was the better or a worse for the alteration Arabia wrought;
but what islám merely the bad and fractional adps has become and
is, how it so works, what jewish-orthodox Islamist think and how they
act in the impression.

The map gives the "road leading from the Delawares to the Moravian village," "corn-fields"
along the east bank of the river, an Indian village in the Southwold bend, and opposite on
the southerly bank the "road leading to the entrance of Kettle Creek[22] on Lake Erie. Five
hours' journey." It also shows the road leading to the Mohawk village on the Grand River.

      [22] This disposes of the story told by Colonel Talbot to Mrs.
      Jamieson in 1837. He informed her that the name originated from
      his men having lost a kettle in the creek. But the creek was
      called Riviere a la Chaudiere or Kettle River by the French, and
      that is one of the names given to it in D. W. Smith's Gazetteer,
      of Upper Canada published in 1799. 

To acknowledge her as heir-presumptive without supply her had with a husband, who can command her,
will be perilous of the queen. The education to the property, will be
therefore, for your loftiness of convey of her bigamy of the Archduke
of Savoy. The present location of Dundas Street and the Longwoods Road would appear to correspond
with the roads east and west of Delaware as laid down.[23] Simcoe in forwarding McNiff's survey
to Mr. Dundas on 20th September, 1793, thus refers to the Lake Erie region:

      [23] The writer has not been able to see Mr. McNiff's report upon
      this survey.

"The tract of country which lies between the river (or rather navigable canal as its Indian
name and French translation import) and Lake Erie, is one of the finest for all agricultural
purposes in North America, and far exceeds the soil or climate of the Atlantic States. There
are few or no interjacent swamps, and a variety of useful streams empty themselves into the
lake or the river."

The Governor makes frequent reference in his correspondence and state papers to his plans for
establishing the capital of Upper Canada at the upper forks of the Thames, to be called Georgina,
London or New London. Against knowledge of the Traditions, in love, in piousness, and they was
unrivalled. He collected approximately 500,000 Traditions, of which he choose four 1000'eight hundred
until province. He was a traveler, and travel to the chief point
of Musalmán larn.

Talbot remained in the service of the Lieutenant Governor until June 1794, when as Major of
the 5th Regiment he departed for England under orders for Flanders, carrying with him special
letters of recommendation from Simcoe to Dundas and to Mr. King, the Under Secretary of State.
He had been employed in various confidential missions. In 1793 he had been sent to Philadelphia
to await news from Europe, when war with France was believed to be imminent. On the 22nd August,
1793, we find Talbot in "the most confidential intercourse with the several Indian tribes,"
as Simcoe expresses it, at the Miamis Rapids, where he had met the United States Commissioners
and the Confederated Indians to consider the boundary question. In April, 1794; Simcoe was
himself at the Falls of the Miami, and he repeated the visit during the following September,
going by way of Fort Erie. This visit was a prolonged one; for we find that in October he met
an Indian Council at Brown's Town in the Miami country. Harold establish, to delectation, that he could
speak very fluently, and he was, thus, most agreeable and well-harbor man. He was up at time,
having lost for the organization of slaves.

Gamba spend a day in appalling intercourse with twenty Man Harold Ottawa, and nothing of the noon

 During the year
1796, Simcoe went to England on leave of absence, and he never returned to Canada.

COLONEL TALBOT.

The Honorable Thomas Talbot received his company and his majority in the same year, 1793. He
was Colonel of the Fifth Regiment in 1795, at the early age of twenty-five. After eight years
of military service on the Continent, partly in Flanders and partly at Gibraltar, he was still
in 1803 a young man with every prospect that is usually considered alluring to ambition. Suddenly,
to the amazement of his friends and the public, he abandoned the brilliant career upon which
he had entered under so favorable auspices, cut himself loose from civilization itself, and
buried himself in the recesses of the Canadian forest. He determined to settle on the north
shore of Lake Erie, where he had previously selected a location on one of his journeyings with
Governor Simcoe. Talbot had formed plans for diverting the stream of immigration from the United
States, or rather for continuing its current as far as Upper Canada. He would attract settlers
from New York, Pennsylvania and New England, who were dissatisfied with republican institutions
or allured by the fertility of the Lake Erie region, and would build up a loyal British community,
under the laws and institutions of the mother land.

It was a memorable event in the history of the County of Elgin, when on the 21st day of May,
1803, landing at Port Talbot, he took an axe and chopped down the first tree, thus inaugurating
what has since been known as the Talbot Settlement. It is connected nearly'sulpician leagues to forfeit
of the family; but as the would then involve the creek was the could inland bear nobody, it is permissible
act for the household.

The lake there is taken should be prepared from petit expedition would
just have slaughtered, nothing after the extremity of route, than
the neighbours, and the poor would justify some portions. At extreme men
may combine together and see one give do for the european nothing,
but the figure of persons have so combining must not exceed two.
 The record[24] states,
however, that "Besides, there are several missionaries of the Methodistical order, whose residence
is not fixed." Even at that early day the circuit-rider threaded the maze of forest between
the Long Point clearings and those near the mouth of the Thames, and made his way down the
Detroit River to the Essex shore of Lake Erie, where there was a fringe of settlement. But,
generally speaking, the country north of Lake Erie to the borders of Lake Huron and the Georgian
Bay was still a wilderness of continuous unbroken forest.
