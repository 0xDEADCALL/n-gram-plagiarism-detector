I had been three months at Hamburg when I learned that the Emperor had at last resolved to
abolish the only remaining memorial of the Republic, namely, the revolutionary calendar.  That
calendar was indeed an absurd innovation, for the new denominations of the months were not
applicable in all places, even in France; the corn of Provence did not wait to be opened by
the sun of the month of Messidor.  On the 9th of September a 'Senates-consulte' decreed that
on the 1st of January following the months and days should resume their own names.  I read
with much interest Laplace's report to the Senate, and must confess I was very glad to see
the Gregorian calendar again acknowledged by law, as it had already been acknowledged in fact.
Frenchmen in foreign countries experienced particular inconvenience from the adoption of a
system different from all the rest of the world.

A few days after the revival of the old calendar the Emperor departed for the army.  When at
Hamburg it may well be supposed that I was anxious to obtain news, and I received plenty from
the interior of Germany and from some friends in Paris.  This correspondence enables me to
present to my readers a comprehensive and accurate picture of the state of public affairs up
to the time when Napoleon took the field.  I have already mentioned how artfully he always
made it appear that he was anxious for peace, and that he was always the party attacked; his,
conduct previous to the first conquest of Vienna affords a striking example of this artifice.
It was pretty evident that the transformation of the Cisalpine Republic into the kingdom of
Italy, and the union of Genoa to France were infractions of treaties; yet the Emperor, nevertheless,
pretended that all the infractions were committed by Austria.  The truth is, that Austria was
raising levies as secretly as  possible, and collecting her troops on the frontiers of Bavaria.
An Austrian corps even penetrated into some provinces of the Electorate; all this afforded
Napoleon a pretest for going to the aid of his allies.

In the memorable sitting preceding his departure the Emperor presented a project of a 'Senatus-consulte'
relative to the re-organisation of the National Guard.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs read
an explanation of the reciprocal conduct of France and Austria since the peace of Luneville,
in which the offences of France were concealed with wonderful skill.  Before the sitting broke
up the Emperor addressed the members, stating that he was about to leave the capital to place
himself at the head of the army to afford prompt succour to his allies, and defend the dearest
interests of his people.  He boasted of his wish to preserve peace, which Austria and Russia,
as he alleged, had, through the influence of England, been induced to disturb.

This address produced a very powerful impression in Hamburg.  For my part, I recognised in
it Napoleon's usual boasting strain; but on this occasion events seemed bent on justifying
it.  The Emperor may certainly have performed more scientific campaigns than that of Austerlitz,
but never any more glorious in results.  Everything seemed to partake of the marvellous, and
I have often thought of the secret joy which Bonaparte must have felt on seeing himself at
last an the point of commencing a great war in Germany, for which he had so often expressed
an ardent desire.  He proceeded first to Strasburg, whither Josephine accompanied him.

All the reports that I received agreed with the statements of my private correspondence in
describing the incredible enthusiasm which prevailed in the army on learning that it was to
march into Germany.  For the first time Napoleon had recourse to an expeditious mode of transport,
and 20,000 carriages conveyed his army, as if by enchantment, from the shores of the Channel
to the banks of the Rhine.  The idea of an active campaign fired the ambition of the junior
part of the army.  All dreamed of glory, and of speedy promotion, and all hoped to distinguish
themselves before the eyes of a chief who was idolised by his troops.  Thus during his short
stay at Strasburg the Emperor might with reason prophesy the success which crowned his efforts
under the walls of Vienna.

Rapp, who accompanied him, informed me that on leaving Strasburg he observed, in the presence
of several persons, "It will be said that I made Mack's plan of campaign for him.  The Caudine
Forks are at Ulm."

     --[This allusion to the Caudine Forks was always in Napoleon's mouth
     when he saw an enemy's army concentrated on a point, and foresaw its
     defeat--Bourrienne.]--

Experience proved that Bonaparte was not deceived; but I ought on this occasion to contradict
a calumnious report circulated at that time, and since maliciously repeated.  It has been said
that there existed an understanding between Mack and Bonaparte, and that the general was bought
over to deliver up the gates of Ulm.  I have received positive proof that this assertion is
a scandalous falsehood; and the only thing that could give it weight was Napoleon's intercession
after the campaign that Mack might not be put on his trial.  In this intercession Napoleon
was actuated only by humanity.

On taking the field Napoleon placed himself at the head of the Bavarians, with whom be opposed
the enemy's army before the arrival of his own troops.  As soon as they were assembled he published
the following proclamation, which still further excited the ardour of the troops.

     SOLDIERS--The war of the third coalition is commenced.  The Austrian
     army has passed the Inn, violated treaties, attacked and driven our
     ally from his capital.  You yourselves have been obliged to hasten,
     by forced marches, to the defence of our frontiers.  But you have
     now passed the Rhine; and we will not stop till we have secured the
     independence of the Germanic body, succoured our allies, and humbled
     the pride of our unjust assailants.  We will not again make peace
     without a sufficient guarantee!  Our generosity shall not again
     wrong our policy.  Soldiers, your Emperor is among you!  You are but
     the advanced guard of the great people.  If it be necessary they
     will all rise at my call to confound and dissolve this new league,
     which has been created by the malice and the gold of England.
     But, soldiers, we shall have forced marches to make, fatigues and
     privations of every kind to endure.  Still, whatever obstacles may
     be opposed to us, we will conquer them; and we will never rest until
     we have planted our eagles on the territory of our enemies!

In the confidential notes of his diplomatic agents, in his speeches, and in his proclamations,
Napoleon always described himself as the attacked party, and perhaps his very earnestness in
so doing sufficed to reveal the truth to all those who had learned to read his thoughts differently
from what his words expressed them.

At the commencement of the campaign of Austerlitz a circumstance occurred from which is to
be dated the fortune of a very meritorious man.  While the Emperor was at Strasburg he asked
General Marescot, the commander-in- chief of the engineers, whether he could recommend from
his corps a brave, prudent, and intelligent young officer, capable of being entrusted with
an important reconnoitering mission.  The officer selected by General Marescot was a captain
in the engineers, named Bernard, who had been educated in the Polytechnic School.  He set off
on his mission, advanced almost to Vienna, and returned to the headquarters of the Emperor
at the capitulation of Ulm.

Bonaparte interrogated him himself, and was well satisfied with his replies; but, not content
with answering verbally the questions put by Napoleon, Captain Bernard had drawn up a report
of what he observed, and the different routes which might be taken.  Among other things he
observed that it would be a great advantage to direct the whole army upon Vienna, without regard
to the fortified places; for that, once master of the capital of Austria, the Emperor might
dictate laws to all the Austrian monarchy.  "I was present," said Rapp to me, "at this young
officer's interview with the Emperor.  After reading the report, would you believe that the
Emperor flew into a furious passion?  'How!' cried he, 'you are very bold, very presumptuous!
A young officer to take the liberty of tracing out a plan of campaign for me!  Begone, and
await my orders.'"

This, and some other circumstances which I shall have to add respecting Captain Bernard, completely
reveal Napoleon's character.  Rapp told me that as soon as the young officer had left the Emperor
all at once changed his tone.  "That," said he, "is a clever young man; he has taken a proper
view of things.  I shall not expose him to the chance of being shot.  Perhaps I shall sometime
want his services.  Tell Berthier to despatch an order for his departure for Elyria."

This order was despatched, and Captain Bernard, who, like his comrades, was ardently looking
forward to the approaching campaign, regarded as a punishment what was, on the Emperor's part,
a precaution to preserve a young man whose merit he appreciated.  At the close of the campaign,
when the Emperor promoted those officers who had distinguished themselves, Bernard, who was
thought to be in disgrace, was not included in Berthier's list among the captains of engineers
whom he recommended to the rank of chef de bataillon; but Napoleon himself inscribed Bernard's
name before all the rest.  However, the Emperor forgot him for some time; and it was only an
accidental circumstance that brought him to his recollection.  I never had any personal acquaintance
with Bernard, but I learned from Rapp, how he afterwards became his colleague as aide de camp
to the Emperor; a circumstance which I shall now relate, though it refers to a later period.

Before the Emperor left Paris for the campaign of 1812 he wished to gain precise information
respecting Ragusa and Elyria.  He sent for Marmont, but was not satisfied with his answers.
He then interrogated several other generals, but the result of his inquiries always was, "This
is all very well; but it is not what I want.  I do not know Ragusa."  He then sent for General
Dejean, who had succeeded M. de Marescot as first inspector of the Engineers.

"Have you any one among your officers," he asked, "who is well acquainted with Ragusa?  "Dejean,
after a little reflection, replied, "Sire, there is a chef de bataillon who has been a long
time forgotten, but who knows Elyria perfectly."--"What's his name?"--"Bernard."--"Ah! stop
.  .  . Bernard!  I remember that name.  Where is he?"--"At Antwerp, Sire, employed on the
fortifications."--"Let a telegraphic despatch be immediately, transmitted,--[by semaphore arms.]--desiring
him to mount his horse and come with all speed to Paris."

The promptitude with which the Emperor's orders were always executed is well known.  A few
days after Captain Bernard was in the Emperor's cabinet in Paris.  Napoleon received him very
graciously.  The first thing he said was, "Talk to me about Ragusa."  This was a favourite
mode of interrogation with him in similar cases, and I have heard him say that it was a sure
way of drawing out all that a man had observed in any country that he had visited.  Be that
as it may, he was perfectly satisfied with M. Bernard's information respecting Elyria; and
when the chef de bataillon had finished speaking Napoleon said, "Colonel Bernard, I am now
acquainted with Ragusa."  The Emperor afterwards conversed familiarly with him, entered into
details respecting the system of fortification adopted at Antwerp, referred to the plan of
the works, criticised it, and showed how he would, if he besieged the town, render the means
of defence unavailing.  The new Colonel explained so well how he would defend the town against
the Emperor's attack that Bonaparte was delighted, and immediately bestowed upon, the young
officer a mark of distinction which, as far as I know, he never granted but upon that single
occasion.  The Emperor was going to preside at the Council of State, and desired Colonel Bernard
to accompany him, and many times during the sittings be asked him for his opinion upon the
points which were under discussion.  On leaving the Council Napoleon said, "Bernard, you are
in future my aide de camp."  After the campaign he was made General of Brigade, soon after
General of Division, and now he is acknowledged to be one of the ablest engineer officers in
existence. Clarke's silly conduct deprived France of this distinguished man, who refused the
brilliant offers of several sovereigns of Europe for the sake of retiring to the United States
of America, where he commands the Engineers, and has constructed fortifications on the coast
of the Floridas which are considered by engineers to be masterpieces of military art.

     Ney's duchy--The French army before Ulm--The Prince of Liechtenstein
     at the Imperial headquarters--His interview with Napoleon described
     by Rapp--Capitulation of Ulm signed by Berthier and Mack--Napoleon
     before and after a victory--His address to the captive generals--
     The Emperor's proclamation--Ten thousand prisoners taken by Murat--
     Battle of Caldiero in Italy--Letter from Duroc--Attempts to retard
     the Emperor's progress--Fruitless mission of M. de Giulay--The first
     French eagles taken by the Russians--Bold adventure of Lannes and
     Murat--The French enter Vienna--Savary's mission to the Emperor
     Alexander.

To convey an idea of the brilliant campaign of 1805 from an abstract of the reports and letters
I received at Hamburg I should, like the almanac- makers, be obliged to note down a victory
for every day.  Was not the rapidity of the Emperor's first operations a thing hitherto unprecedented?
He departed from Paris on the 24th of September, and hostilities commenced on the 2d of October.
On the 6th and 7th the French passed the Danube, and turned the enemy's army.  On the 8th Murat,
at the battle of Wertingen, on the Danube, took 2000 Austrian prisoners, amongst whom, besides
other general officers, was Count Auffemberg. Next day the Austrians fell back upon Gunsburg,
retreating before our victorious legions, who, pursuing their triumphal course, entered Augsburg
on the 10th, and Munich on the 12th.  When I received my despatches I could have fancied I
was reading a fabulous narrative.  Two days after the French entered Munich--that is to say,
on the 14th--an Austrian corps of 6000 men surrendered to Marshal Soult at Memingen, whilst
Ney conquered, sword in hand, his future Duchy of Elchingen. Finally, on the 17th of October,
came the famous capitulation of General Mack at Ulm,' and on the same day hostilities commenced
in Italy between the French and Austrians, the former commanded by Massena and the latter by
Prince Charles.

     --[Prince Maurice Liechtenstein was sent by General Mack as a flag
     of truce to the Imperial headquarters before Ulm.  He was, according
     to custom, led blindfold on horseback.  Rapp, who was present,
     together with several of Napoleon's aides de camp, afterwards spoke
     to me of the Prince's interview with the Emperor.  I think he told
     me that Berthier was present likewise.  "Picture to yourself," said
     Rapp, "the astonishment, or rather confusion, of the poor Prince
     when the bandage was removed from his eyes.  He knew nothing of what
     had been going on, and did not even suspect that the Emperor had yet
     joined the army.  When he understood that he was in the presence of
     Napoleon he could not suppress an exclamation of surprise, which did
     not escape the Emperor, and he ingenuously acknowledged that General
     Mack had no idea he was before the walls of Ulm."  Prince
     Liechtenstein proposed to capitulate on condition that the garrison
     of Ulm should be allowed to return into Austria.  This proposal, in
     the situation in which the garrison stood, Rapp said, made the
     Emperor smile.  "How can you expect," said Napoleon, "that I can
     accede to such a proposition?  What shall I gain by it?  Eight days.
     In eight days you will be in my power without any condition.  Do you
     suppose I am not acquainted with everything?  .  .  You expect the
     Russians? .  .  .  At the nearest they are in Bohemia.  Were I to
     allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not
     join them, and afterwards fight against me?  Your generals have
     deceived me often enough, and I will no longer be duped.  At Marengo
     I was weak enough to allow the troops of Melas to march out of
     Alessandria.  He promised to treat for peace.  What happened?  Two
     months after Moreau had to fight with the garrison of Alessandria.
     Besides, this war is not an ordinary war.  After the conduct of your
     Government I am not bound to keep any terms with it.  I have no
     faith in its promises.  You have attacked me.  If I should agree to
     what you ask, Mack would pledge his word, I know.  But, even relying
     on his good faith, would be he able to keep his promise?  As far as
     regards himself--yes; but as regards his army--no.  If the Archduke
     Ferdinand were still with you I could rely upon his word, because he
     would be responsible for the conditions, and he would not disgrace
     himself; but I know he has quitted Ulm and passed the Danube.  I
     know how to reach him, however."

     Rapp said it was impossible to imagine the embarrassment of Prince
     Liechtenstein whilst the Emperor was speaking.  He, however,
     somewhat regained his self-possession, and observed that, unless the
     conditions which he proposed were granted the army would not
     capitulate.  "If that be the case," said Napoleon.  "you may as well
     go back to Mack, for I will never grant such conditions.  Are you
     jesting with me?  Stay; here is the capitulation of Memingen--show
     it to your General--let him surrender on the same conditions--I will
     consent to no others.  Your officers may return to Austria, but the
     soldiers must be prisoners.  Tell him to be speedy, for I have no
     time to lose.  The more he delays the worse he will render his own
     condition and yours.  To-morrow I shall have here the corps to which
     Memingen capitulated, and then we shall see what is to be done.
     Make Mack clearly understand that he has no alternative but to
     conform to my will."

     The imperious tones which Napoleon employed towards his enemies
     almost always succeeded, and it produced the accustomed effect upon
     Mack.  On the same day that Prince Liechtenstein had been at our
     headquarters Mack wrote to the Emperor, stating that he would not
     have treated with any other on such terms; but that he yielded to
     the ascendency of Napoleon's fortune; and on the following day
     Berthier was sent into Ulm, from whence he returned with the
     capitulation signed.  Thus Napoleon was not mistaken respecting the
     Caudine Forks of the Austrian army.  The garrison of Ulm marched out
     with what are called the honours of war, and were led prisoners into
     France.--Bourrienne.]--

Napoleon, who was so violently irritated by any obstacle which opposed him, and who treated
with so much hauteur everybody who ventured to resist his inflexible will, was no longer the
same man when, as a conqueror, he received the vanquished generals at Ulm.  He condoled with
them on their misfortune; and this, I can affirm, was not the result of a feeling of pride
concealed beneath a feigned generosity.  Although he profited by their defeat he pitied them
sincerely.  How frequently has he observed to me, "How much to be pitied is a general on the
day after a lost battle."  He had himself experienced this misfortune when he was obliged to
raise the siege of St. Jean d'Acre.  At that moment he would, I believe, have strangled Djezzar;
but if Djezzar had surrendered, he would have treated him with the same attention which he
showed to Mack and the other generals of the garrison of Ulm.  These generals were seventeen
in number, and among them was Prince Liechtenstein.  There were also General Klenau (Baron
de Giulay), who had acquired considerable military reputation in the preceding wars, and General
Fresnel, who stood in a more critical situation than his companions in misfortune, for he was
a Frenchman, and an emigrant.

Rapp told me that it was really painful to see these generals.  They bowed respectfully to
the Emperor, having Mack at their head.  They preserved a mournful silence, and Napoleon was
the first to speak, which he did in the following terms: "Gentlemen, I feel sorry that such
brave men as you are should be the victims of the follies of a Cabinet which cherishes insane
projects, and which does not hesitate to commit the dignity of the Austrian nation by trafficking
with the services of its generals.  Your names are known to me--they are honourably known wherever
you have fought.  Examine the conduct of those who have committed you. What could be more iniquitous
than to attack me without a declaration of war?  Is it not criminal to bring foreign invasion
upon a country?  Is it not betraying Europe to introduce Asiatic barbarities into her disputes?
If good policy had been followed the Aulic Council, instead of attacking me, would have sought
my alliance in order to drive back the Russians to the north.  The alliance which your Cabinet
has formed will appear monstrous in history.  It is the alliance of dogs, shepherds, and wolves
against sheep--such a scheme could never have been planned in the mind of a statesman.  It
is fortunate for you that I have not been defeated in the unjust struggle to which I have been
provoked; if I had, the Cabinet of Vienna would have soon perceived its error, for which, perhaps,
it will yet one day pay dearly."

What a change fifteen days of success, crowned by the capture of Ulm, had made in affairs!
At Hamburg I knew through my agents to what a degree of folly the hopes of Napoleon's enemies
had risen before he began the campaign.  The security of the Cabinet of Vienna was really inexplicable;
not only did they not dream of the series of victories which made Napoleon master of all the
Austrian monarchy, but the assistants of Drake and all the intriguers of that sort treated
France already as a conquered country, and disposed of some of our provinces.  In the excess
of their folly, to only give one instance, they promised the town of Lyons to the King of Sardinia,
to recompense him for the temporary occupation of Piedmont.

     --[In the treaties and declarations (see Martens and Thiers, tome v.
     p. 355) there is rather a tendency to sell the skin of the bear
     before killing him.]--

While Napoleon flattered his prisoners at the expense of their Government he wished to express
satisfaction at the conduct of his own army, and with this view he published a remarkable proclamation,
which in some measure presented an abstract of all that had taken place since the opening of
the campaign.

This proclamation was as follows:--

     SOLDIERS OF THE GRAND ARMY--In a fortnight we have finished an
     entire campaign.  What we proposed to do has been done.  We have
     driven the Austrian troops from Bavaria, and restored our ally to
     the sovereignty of his dominions.

     That army, which, with equal presumption and imprudence, marched
     upon our frontiers, is annihilated.

     But what does this signify to England?  She has gained her object.
     We are no longer at Boulogne, and her subsidy will be neither more
     nor less.

     Of a hundred thousand men who composed that army, sixty thousand are
     prisoners.  They will replace our conscripts in the labours of
     agriculture.

     Two hundred pieces of cannon, the whole park of artillery, ninety
     flags, and all their generals are in our power.  Fifteen thousand
     men only have escaped.

     Soldiers!  I announced to you the result of a great battle; but,
     thanks to the ill-devised schemes of the enemy, I was enabled to
     secure the wished-for result without incurring any danger, and, what
     is unexampled in the history of nations, that result has been gained
     at the sacrifice of scarcely fifteen hundred men killed and wounded.

     Soldiers! this success is due to your unlimited confidence in your
     Emperor, to your patience in enduring fatigues and privations of
     every kind, and to your singular courage and intrepidity.

     But we will not stop here.  You are impatient to commence another
     campaign!

     The Russian army, which English gold has brought from the
     extremities of the universe, shall experience the same fate as that
     which we have just defeated.

     In the conflict in which we are about to engage the honour of the
     French infantry is especially concerned.  We shall now see another
     decision of the question which has already been determined in
     Switzerland and Holland; namely, whether the French infantry is the
     first or the second in Europe.

     Among the Russians there are no generals in contending against whom
     I can acquire any glory.  All I wish is to obtain the victory with
     the least possible bloodshed.  My soldiers are, my children.

This proclamation always appeared to me a masterpiece of military eloquence.  While he lavished
praises on his troops, he excited their emulation by hinting that the Russians were capable
of disputing with them the first rank among the infantry of Europe, and he concluded his address
by calling them his children.

The second campaign, to which Napoleon alleged they so eagerly looked forward, speedily ensued,
and hostilities were carried on with a degree of vigour which fired the enthusiasm of the army.
Heaven knows what accounts were circulated of the Russians, who, as Bonaparte solemnly stated
in his proclamation, had come from the extremity of the world. They were represented as half-naked
savages, pillaging, destroying and burning wherever they went.  It was even asserted that they
were cannibals, and had been seen to eat children.  In short, at that period was introduced
the denomination of northern barbarians which has since been so generally applied to the Russians.
Two days after the capitulation of Ulm Murat obtained the capitulation of Trochtelfingen from
General Yarneck, and made 10,000 prisoners, so that, without counting killed and wounded, the
Austrian army had sustained a diminution of 50,000 men after a campaign of twenty days.  On
the 27th of October the French army crossed the Inn, and thus penetrated into the Austrian
territory.  Salzburg and Brannan were immediately taken.  The army of Italy, under the command
of Massena, was also obtaining great advantages. On the 30th of October, that is to say, the
very day on which the Grand Army took the above-mentioned fortresses, the army of Italy, having
crossed the Adige, fought a sanguinary battle at Caldiero, and took 5000 Austrian prisoners.

In the extraordinary campaign, which has been distinguished by the name of "the Campaign of
Austerlitz," the exploits of our troops succeeded each other with the rapidity of thought.
I confess I was equally astonished and delighted when I received a note from Duroc, sent by
an extraordinary courier, and commencing laconically with the words, "We are in Vienna; the
Emperor is well."

Duroc's letter was dated the 13th November, and the words, "We are in Vienna," seemed to me
the result of a dream.  The capital of Austria, which from time immemorial had not been occupied
by foreigners--the city which Sobieski had saved from Ottoman violence, had become the prey
of the Imperial eagle of France, which, after a lapse of three centuries, avenged the humiliations
formerly imposed upon Francis I. by the 'Aquila Grifagna' of Charles V.  Duroc had left the
Emperor before the camp of Boulogne was raised; his mission to Berlin being terminated, he
rejoined the Emperor at Lintz.

     --[As soon as Bonaparte became Emperor he constituted himself the
     avenger of all the insults given to the sovereigns, whom he styled
     his predecessors.  All that related to the honour of France was
     sacred to him.  Thus he removed the column of Rosbach from the
     Prussian territory.--Bourrienne.]--

Before I noticed the singular mission of M. Haugwitz to the Emperor Napoleon, and the result
of that mission, which circumstances rendered diametrically the reverse of its object, I will
relate what came to my knowledge respecting some other negotiations on the part of Austria,
the evident intent of which was to retard Napoleon's progress, and thereby to dupe him.  M.
de Giulay, one of the generals included in the capitulation of Ulm, had returned home to acquaint
his sovereign with the disastrous event.  He did not conceal, either from the Emperor Francis
or the Cabinet of Vienna, the destruction of the Austrian army, and the impossibility of arresting
the rapid advance of the French.  M. de Giulay was sent with a flag of truce to the headquarters
of Napoleon, to assure him of the pacific intentions of the Emperor of Austria, and to solicit
an armistice.  The snare was too clumsy not to be immediately discovered by so crafty a man
as Napoleon.

     --[Metternich (tome ii.  p. 346, compare French edition, tome ii.
     p. 287) says, "Let us hold always the sword in one hand and the
     olive branch in the other; always ready to negotiate, but only
     negotiating while advancing."  Here is Napoleons system.]--

He had always pretended a love for peace, though be was overjoyed at the idea of continuing
a war so successfully commenced, and he directed General Giulay to assure the Emperor of Austria
that he was not less anxious for peace than he, and that he was ready to treat for it, but
without suspending the course of his operations.  Bonaparte, indeed, could not, without a degree
of imprudence of which he was incapable, consent to an armistice; for M. de Giulay, though
entrusted with powers from Austria, had received none from Russia.  Russia, therefore, might
disavow the armistice and arrive in time to defend Vienna, the occupation of which was so important
to the French army.  The Russians, indeed, were advancing to oppose us, and the corps of our
army, commanded by Mortier on the left bank of the Danube, experienced in the first engagement
a check at Dirnstein, which not a little vexed the Emperor.  This was the first reverse of
fortune we had sustained throughout the campaign.  It was trivial, to be sure, but the capture
by the Russians of three French eagles, the first that had fallen into the hands of the enemy,
was very mortifying to Napoleon, and caused him to prolong for some days his staff at St. Folten,
where he then was.

The rapid occupation of Vienna was due to the successful temerity of Lannes and Murat, two
men alike distinguished for courage and daring spirit.  A bold artifice of these generals prevented
the destruction of the Thabor bridge at Vienna, without which our army would have experienced
considerable difficulty in penetrating into the Austrian capital.  This act of courage and
presence of mind, which had so great an influence on the events of the campaign, was described
to me by Lannes, who told the story with an air of gaiety, unaccompanied by any self- complacency,
and seemed rather pleased with the trick played upon the Austrians than proud of the brilliant
action which had been performed. Bold enterprises were so natural to Lannes that he was frequently
the only person who saw nothing extraordinary in his own exploits.  Alas! what men were sacrificed
to Napoleon's ambition!

The following is the story of the Bridge of Thabor as I heard it from Lannes:--

     --[I was one day walking with Murat, on the right bank of the
     Danube, and we observed on the left bank, which was occupied by the
     Austrians, some works going on, the evident object of which was to
     blow up the bridge on the approach of our troops.  The fools had the
     impudence to make these preparations under our very noses; but we
     gave them a good lesson.  Having arranged our plan, we returned to
     give orders, and I entrusted the command of my column of grenadiers
     to an officer on whose courage and intelligence I could rely.  I
     then returned to the bridge, accompanied by Murat and two or three
     other officers.  We advanced, unconcernedly, and entered into
     conversation with the commander of a post in the middle of the
     bridge.  We spoke to him about an armistice which was to be speedily
     concluded: While conversing with the Austrian officers we contrived
     to make them turn their eyes towards the left bank, and then,
     agreeably to the orders we had given, my column of grenadiers
     advanced on the bridge.  The Austrian cannoneers, on the left bank,
     seeing their officers in the midst of us, did not dare to fire, and
     my column advanced at a quick step.  Murat and I, at the head of it,
     gained the left bank.  All the combustibles prepared for blowing up
     the bridge were thrown into the river, and my men took possession of
     the batteries erected for the defence of the bridge head.  The poor
     devils of Austrian officers were perfectly astounded when I told
     them they were my prisoners.]--

Such, as well as I can recollect, was the account given by Lannes, who laughed immoderately
in describing the consternation of the Austrian officers when they discovered the trick that
had been played upon them. When Lannes performed this exploit he had little idea of the, important
consequences which would attend, it.  He had not only secured to the remainder of the French
army a sure and easy entrance to Vienna, but, without being aware of it, he created an insurmountable
impediment to the junction of the Russian army with the Austrian corps, commanded by Prince
Charles, who, being pressed by Massena, hastily advanced into the heart of the Hereditary States,
where he fully expected a great battle would take place.

As soon as the corps of Murat and Lannes had taken possession of Vienna the Emperor ordered
all the divisions of the army to march upon that capital.

     --[The story to told in much the same way in Theirs (tome vi, p.
     260), Rupp (p.  57), and Savory (tome ii.  p.  162), but as Erreurs
     (tome i.  p.  814) points out, Bourrienne makes an odd mistake in
     believing the Thabor Bridge gave the French access to Vienna.  The
     capital is on the right bank, and was already in their power.  The
     possession of the bridge enabled them to pass over to the left bank,
     and to advance towards Austerlitz before the Archduke Charles,
     coming from Italy, could make his junction with the allied army.
     See plan 48 of Thiers' Atlas, or 58 of Alison's.  The immediate
     result of the success of this rather doubtful artifice would have
     been the destruction of the corps of Kutusoff; but Murat in his turn
     was deceived by Bagration into belief in an armistice.  In fact,
     both sides at this time fell into curious errors.]--

Napoleon established his headquarters at Schoenbrunn, where he planned his operations for compelling
the corps of Prince Charles to retire to Hungary, and also for advancing his own forces to
meet the Russians. Murat and Lannes always commanded the advanced guard during the forced marches
ordered by Napoleon, which were executed in a way truly miraculous.

To keep up the appearance of wishing to conclude peace as soon as reasonable propositions should
be made to him, Napoleon sent for his Minister for foreign Affairs, who speedily arrived at
Vienna, and General Savary was sent on a mission to the Emperor Alexander.  The details of
this mission I have learned only from the account of it given by the Duc de Rovigo in his apologetic
Memoirs.  In spite of the Duke's eagerness to induce a belief in Napoleon's pacific disposition,
the very facts on which he supports his argument lead to the contrary conclusion. Upon post that
they meet with action. The force had abandon it, for poverty, as was always think; and it was append

     "He had been a fortnight at Schoenbrunn," said Rapp to me, "and I had
     not yet resumed my duties, when the Emperor sent for me.  He asked
     me whether I was able to travel, and on my replying in the
     affirmative, he said, 'Go then, and give an account of the battle of
     Austerlitz to Marmont, and vex him for not having been at it.'  I set
     off, and in conformity with the instructions I had received from the
     Emperor I proceeded to Gratz, where I found Marmont, who was indeed
     deeply mortified at not having had a share in the great battle.
     I told him, as the Emperor had directed me, that the negotiations
     were commenced, but that nothing was yet concluded, and that
     therefore, at all events, he must hold himself in readiness.  I
     ascertained the situation of his army in Styria, and the amount of
     the enemy's force before him: The Emperor wished him to send a
     number of spies into Hungary, and to transmit to him a detailed
     report from their communications.  I next proceeded to Laybach,
     where I found Massena at the head of the eighth corps, and I
     informed him that the Emperor wished him to march in all haste upon
     Vienna, in case he should hear of the rupture of the negotiations.
     I continued the itinerary marked out for me until I reached Venice,
     and thence till I met the troops of Carra St. Cyr, who had received
     orders to march back upon Naples as soon as the Emperor heard of the
     treachery of the King of Naples and the landing of the English and
     Russians.  Having fulfilled these different missions I proceeded to
     Klagenfurth, where I saw Marshal Ney, and I afterwards rejoined the
     Emperor at Munich.  There I had the pleasure of finding our friends
     assembled, and among them Josephine, still as affable and amiable as
     ever.  How delighted I was when, an my arrival, I learned that the
     Emperor had adopted Eugene.  I was present at his marriage with the
     Princess Augusta of Bavaria.  As to me, you know I am not very fond
     of fetes, and the Emperor might have dispensed with my performing
     the duties of Chamberlain; Eugene had no idea of what was going on
     when the Emperor sent to desire his presence at Munich with all
     possible speed.  He, too, remains unchanged; he is still our old
     comrade.  At first he was not much pleased with the idea of a
     political marriage; but when he saw his bride he was quite
     enchanted; and no wonder, for I assure you she is a very charming
     woman."

CHAPTER IV.

1805.

     Depreciation of the Bank paper--Ouvrard--His great discretion--
     Bonaparte'e opinion of the rich--Ouvrard's imprisonment--His
     partnership with the King of Spain--His connection with Waalenberghe
     and Desprez--Bonaparte's return to Paris after the campaign of
     Vienna--Hasty dismissal of M. Barbe Marbois.

At the moment when the Emperor had reason to hope that the news of his extraordinary success
would animate public spirit he was informed that considerable disquietude prevailed, and that
the Bank of France was assailed by demands for the payment of its paper, which had fallen,
more than 5 per cent.  I was not ignorant of the cause of this decline.  I had been made acquainted,
through the commercial correspondence between Hamburg and Paris, with a great financial operation,
planned by M. Ouvrard, in consequence of which he was to obtain piastres from Spanish America
at a price much below the real value; and I had learned that he was obliged to support this
enterprise by the funds which he and his partners previously employed in victualling the forces.
A fresh investment of capital was therefore necessary for this service, which, when on a large
scale, requires extensive advances, and the tardy payment of the Treasury at that period was
well known.

I was well acquainted with M. Ouvrard, and in what I am about to say I do not think there will
be found anything offensive or disagreeable to him. I observed the greater number of the facts
to which I shall refer in their origin, and the rest I learned from M. Ouvrard himself, who,
when he visited Hamburg in 1808, communicated to me a variety of details respecting his immense
transaction with the King of Spain.  Among other things I recollect he told me that before
the 18th Brumaire he was possessed of 60,000,000, without owing a franc to any person.

This celebrated financier has been the object of great public attention. The prodigious variations
of fortune which he has experienced, the activity of his life, the immense commercial operations
in which he has been engaged; the extent and the boldness of his enterprises, render it necessary,
in forming a judgment of M. Ouvrard, to examine his conduct with due care and deliberation.
The son of a stationer, who was able merely through his own resources to play so remarkable
a part, could be no ordinary man.  It may be said of M. Ouvrard what Beaumarchais said of himself,
that his life was really a combat.  I have known him long, and I saw much of him in his relations
with Josephine.  He always appeared to me to possess great knowledge of the world, accompanied
by honourable principles, and a high degree of generosity, which added greatly to the value
of his prudence and discretion.  No human power, no consideration, not even the ingratitude
of those whom he had obliged, could induce him to disclose any sacrifice which he had made
at the time when, under the Directory, the public revenue may be said to have been always at
the disposal of the highest bidder, and when no business could be brought to a conclusion except
by him who set about it with his hands full of money. To this security, with which M. Ouvrard
impressed all official persons who rendered him services, I attribute the facility with which
be obtained the direction of the numerous enterprises in which he engaged, and which produced
so many changes in his fortune.  The discretion of M. Ouvrard was not quite agreeable to the
First Consul, who found it impossible to extract from him the information he wanted.  He tried
every method to obtain from him the names of persons to whom he had given those kind of subsidies
which in vulgar language are called sops in the pan, and by ladies pin money.  Often have I
seen Bonaparte resort to every possible contrivance to gain his object.  He would sometimes
endeavour to alarm M. Ouvrard by menaces, and at other times to flatter him by promises, but
he was in no instance successful.

While we were at the Luxembourg, on, as I recollect, the 25th of January 1800, Bonaparte said
to me during breakfast, "Bourrienne, my resolution is taken.  I shall have Ouvrard arrested."--"General,
have you proofs against him?"--"Proofs, indeed!  He is a money-dealer, a monopoliser; we must
make him disgorge.  All the contractors, the provision agents, are rogues.  How have they made
their fortunes?  At the expense of the country, to be sure.  I will not suffer such doings.
They possess millions, they roll in an insolent luxury, while my soldiers have neither bread
nor shoes!  I will have no more of that!  I intend to speak on the business to-day in the Council,
and we shall see what can be done."

I waited with impatience for his return from the Council to know what had passed.  "Well, General?"
said I "The order is given."  On hearing this I became anxious about the fate of M. Ouvrard,
who was thus to be treated more like a subject of the Grand Turk than a citizen of the Republic;
but I soon learned that the order had not been executed because he could not be found.

Next day I learned that a person, whom I shall not name, who was present at the Council, and
who probably was under obligations to Ouvrard, wrote him a note in pencil to inform him of
the vote for his arrest carried by the First Consul.  This individual stepped out for a moment
and despatched his servant with the note to Ouvrard.  Having thus escaped the writ of arrest,
Ouvrard, after a few days had passed over, reappeared, and surrendered himself prisoner.  Bonaparte
was at first furious on learning that he had got out of the way; but on hearing that Ouvrard
had surrendered himself he said to me, "The fool!  he does not know what is awaiting him! 
He wishes to make the public believe that he has nothing to fear; that his hands are clean.
But he is playing a bad game; he will gain nothing in that way with me.  All talking is nonsense.
You may be sure, Bourrienne, that when a man has so much money he cannot have got it honestly,
and then all those fellows are dangerous with their fortunes. In times of revolution no man
ought to have more than 3,000,000 francs, and that is a great deal too much."

Before going to prison Ouvrard took care to secure against all the searches of the police any
of his papers which might have committed persons with whom he had dealings; and I believe that
there were individuals connected with the police itself who had good reason for not regretting
the opportunity which M. Ouvrard had taken for exercising this precaution.  Seals, however,
were put upon his papers; but on examining them none of the information Bonaparte so much desired
to obtain was found.  Nevertheless on one point his curiosity was satisfied, for on looking
over the documents he found from some of them that Madame Bonaparte had been borrowing money
from Ouvrard.

As Ouvrard had a great number of friends they bestirred themselves to get some person of influence
to speak to the First Consul in his favour. But this was a commission no one was willing to
undertake; because, prejudiced as Bonaparte was, the least hint of the kind would have appeared
to him to be dictated by private interest.  Berthier was very earnestly urged to interfere,
but he replied, "That is impossible.  He would say that it was underhand work to get money
for Madame Visconti."

I do not recollect to what circumstance Ouvrard was indebted for his liberty, but it is certain
that his captivity did not last long. Sometime after he had left his prison Bonaparte asked
him for 12,000,000, which M. Ouvrard refused.

On his accession to the Consulate Bonaparte found M. Ouvrard contractor for supplying the Spanish
fleet under the command of Admiral Massaredo. This business introduced him to a correspondence
with the famous Godoy, Prince of the Peace.  The contract lasted three years, and M. Ouvrard
gained by it a net profit of 15,000,000.  The money was payable in piastres, at the rate of
3 francs and some centimes each, though the piastre was really worth 5 francs 40 centimes.
But to recover it at this value it was necessary for M. Ouvrard to go and get the money in
Mexico. This he was much inclined to do, but he apprehended some obstacle on the part of the
First Consul, and, notwithstanding his habitual shrewdness, he became the victim of his over-precaution.
On his application M. de Talleyrand undertook to ask the First Consul for authority to give
him a passport.  I was in the cabinet at the time, and I think I still hear the dry and decided
"No," which was all the answer M. de Talleyrand obtained.  When we were alone the First Consul
said to me, "Do you not see, Bourrienne, this Ouvrard must have made a good thing of his business
with the Prince of the Peace?  But the fool!  Why did he get Talleyrand to ask me for a passport?
That is the very thing that raised my suspicion.  Why did he not apply for a passport as every
one else does? Have I the giving of them?  He is an ass; so much the worse for him."

I was sorry for Ouvrard's disappointment, and I own none the less so because he had intimated
his willingness to give me a share in the business he was to transact its Spain; and which
was likely to be very profitable.  His brother went to Mexico in his stead.

In 1802 a dreadful scarcity afflicted France.  M. Ouvrard took upon himself, in concert with
Wanlerberghe, the task of importing foreign grain to prevent the troubles which might otherwise
have been expected. In payment of the grain the foreign houses who sent it drew upon Ouvrard
and Wanlerberghe for 26,000,000 francs in Treasury bills, which, according to the agreement
with the Government, were to be paid.  But when the bills of the foreign houses became due
there was no money in the Treasury, and payment was refused.  After six months had elapsed
payment was offered, but on condition that the Government should retain half the profit of
the commission!  This Ouvrard and Wanlerberghe refused, upon which the Treasury thought it
most economical to pay nothing, and the debt remained unsettled.  Notwithstanding this transaction
Ouvrard and Wanlerberghe engaged to victual the navy, which they supplied for six years and
three months.  After the completion of these different services the debt due to them amounted
to 68,000,000.

In consequence of the long delay of, payment by the Treasury the disbursements for supplies
of grain amounted at least to more than 40,000,000; and the difficulties which arose had a
serious effect on the credit of the principal dealers with those persons who supplied them.
The discredit spread and gradually reached the Treasury, the embarrassments of which augmented
with the general alarm.  Ouvrard, Wanlerberghe, and Seguin were the persons whose capital and
credit rendered them most capable of relieving the Treasury, and they agreed to advance for
that purpose 102,000,000, in return for which they were allowed bonds of the Receivers-General
to the amount of 150,000,000.  M. Desprez undertook to be the medium through which the 102,000,000
were to be paid into the Treasury, and the three partners transferred the bands to him.

Spain had concluded a treaty with France, by which she was bound to pay a subsidy of 72,000,000
francs, and 32,000,000 had become due without any payment being made: It was thought advisable
that Ouvrard should be sent to Madrid to obtain a settlement, but he was afraid that his business
in Paris would suffer during his absence, and especially the transaction in which he was engaged
with Desprez.  The Treasury satisfied him on this point by agreeing to sanction the bargain
with Desprez, and Ouvrard proceeded to Madrid.  It was on this occasion he entered into the
immense speculation for trading with Spanish America.

Spain wished to pay the 32,000,000 which were due to France as soon as possible, but her coffers
were empty, and goodwill does not ensure ability; besides, in addition to the distress of the
Government, there was a dreadful famine in Spain.  In this state of things Ouvrard proposed
to the Spanish Government to pay the debt due to France, to import a supply of corn, and to
advance funds for the relief of the Spanish Treasury.  For this he required two conditions.
(1.) The exclusive right of trading with America. In opposition to it came, he was not merely could
be aver the principles whom accustom to liberty, but ancient mind. During 100 and fifty men there are

Having concluded this business Ouvrard returned in all haste to Madrid; but in the midst of
the most flattering hopes and most gigantic enterprises he suddenly found himself threatened
with a dreadful crisis. M. Desprez, as has been stated, had, with the concurrence of the Treasury,
been allowed to take upon himself all the risk of executing the treaty, by which 150,000,000
were to be advanced for the year 1804, and 400,000,000 for the year 1805.  Under the circumstances
which had arisen the Minister of the Treasury considered himself entitled to call upon Ouvrard
to place at his disposal 10,000,000 of the piastres which he had received from Spain.  The
Minister at the same time informed him that he had made arrangements on the faith of this advance,
which he thought could not be refused at so urgent a moment.

The embarrassment of the Treasury, and the well-known integrity of the Minister, M. de Barbe
Marbois, induced Ouvrard to remit the 10,000,000 piastres.  But a few days after he had forwarded
the money a Commissioner of the Treasury arrived at Madrid with a ministerial despatch, in
which Ouvrard was requested to deliver to the Commissioner all the assets he could command,
and to return immediately to Paris.

The Treasury was then in the greatest difficulty, and a general alarm prevailed.  This serious
financial distress was occasioned by the following circumstances.  The Treasury had, by a circular,
notified to the Receivers-General that Desprez was the holder of their bonds.  They were also
authorised to transmit to him all their disposable funds, to be placed to their credit in an
account current.  Perhaps the giving of this authority was a great error; but, be that as it
may, Desprez, encouraged by the complaisance of the Treasury, desired the Receivers-General
to transmit to him all the sums they could procure for payment of interest under 8 per cent.,
promising to allow them a higher rate of interest.  As the credit of the house of Desprez stood
high, it may be easily conceived that on such conditions the Receivers-General, who were besides
secured by the authority of the Treasury, would enter eagerly into the proposed plan.  In short,
the Receivers-General soon transmitted very considerable sums.  Chests of money arrived daily
from every point of France. Intoxicated by this success, Desprez engaged in speculations which
in his situation were extremely imprudent.  He lent more than 50,000,000 to the merchants of
Paris, which left him no command of specie.  Being obliged to raise money, he deposited with
the Bank the bonds of the Receivers- General which had been consigned to him, but which were
already discharged by the sums transmitted to their credit in the account current.  The Bank,
wishing to be reimbursed for the money advanced to Desprez, applied to the Receivers-General
whose bonds were held an security.  This proceeding had become necessary on the part of the
Bank, as Desprez, instead of making his payments in specie, sent in his acceptances.  The Directors
of the Bank, who conducted that establishment with great integrity and discretion, began to
be alarmed, and required Desprez to explain the state of his affairs.  The suspicions of the
Directors became daily stronger, and were soon shared by the public.  At last the Bank was
obliged to stop payment, and its notes were soon at a discount of 12 per cent.

The Minister of the Treasury, dismayed, as well may be supposed, at such a state of things
during the Emperor's absence, convoked a Council, at which Joseph Bonaparte presided, and to
which Desprez and Wanlerberghe were summoned.  Ouvrard being informed of this financial convulsion
made all possible haste from Madrid, and on his arrival at Paris sought assistance from Amsterdam.
Hope's house offered to take 15,000,000 piastres at the rate of 3 francs 75 centimes each.
Ouvrard having engaged to pay the Spanish Government only 3 francs, would very willingly have
parted with them at that rate, but his hasty departure from Madrid, and the financial events
at Paris, affected his relations with the Spanish Treasury, and rendered it impossible for
him to afford any support to the Treasury of France; thus the alarm continued, until the news
of the battle of Austerlitz and the consequent hope of peace tranquillised the public mind.
The bankruptcy of Desprez was dreadful; it was followed by the failure of many houses, the
credit of which was previously undoubted.

To temper the exultation which victory was calculated to excite, the news of the desperate
situation of the Treasury and the Bank reached the Emperor on the day after the battle of Austerlitz.
The alarming accounts which he received hastened his return to France; and on the very evening
on which he arrived in Paris he pronounced, while ascending the stairs of the Tuileries, the
dismissal of M. de Barbs Marbois.  This Minister had made numerous enemies by the strict discharge
of his duty, and yet, notwithstanding his rigid probity, he sunk under the accusation of having
endangered the safety of the State by weakness of character.  At this period even Madame de
Stael said, in a party where the firmness of M. Barbs Marbois was the topic of conversation--"What,
he inflexible?  He is only a reed bronzed!"  But whatever may be the opinion entertained of
the character of this Minister, it is certain that Napoleon's rage against him was unbounded.
Such was the financial catastrophe which occurred during the campaign of Vienna; but all was
not over with Ouvrard, and in so great a confusion of affairs it was not to be expected that
the Imperial hand, which was not always the hand of justice, should not make itself somewhere felt.

In the course of the month of February 1806 the Emperor issued two decrees, in which he declared
Ouvrard, Wanlerberghe, and Michel, contractors for the service of 1804, and Desprez their agent,
debtors to the amount of 87,000,000, which they had misapplied in private speculations, and
in transactions with Spain "for their personal interests."  Who would not suppose from this
phrase that Napoleon had taken no part whatever in the great financial operation between Spain
and South America?  He was, however, intimately acquainted with it, and was himself really
and personally interested.  But whenever any enterprise was unsuccessful he always wished to
deny all connection with it. Possessed of title-deeds made up by himself--that is to say, his
own decrees--the Emperor seized all the piastres and other property belonging to the Company,
and derived from the transaction great pecuniary advantage,--though such advantage never could
be regarded by a sovereign as any compensation for the dreadful state into which the public
credit had been brought.

I have been somewhat diffuse respecting the vast enterprises of M. Ouvrard, and on the disastrous
state of the finances during the campaign of Vienna.  Now, if I may so express myself, I shall
return to the Minister Plenipotentiary's cabinet, where several curious transactions occurred.
The facts will not always be given in a connected series, because there was no more relation
between the reports which I received on a great variety of subjects than there is in the pleading
of the barristers who succeed each other in a court of justice.

On the 2d of January 1806 I learned that many houses in Hamburg had received by post packets,
each containing four copies of a declaration of Louis XVIII.  Dumouriez had his carriage filled
with copies of this declaration when he passed through Brunswick; and in that small town alone
more than 3000 were distributed.  The size of this declaration rendered its transmission by
post very easy, even in France.

All my letters from the Minister recommended that I should keep a strict watch over the motions
of Dumouriez; but his name was now as seldom mentioned as if he had ceased to exist.  The part
he acted seemed to be limited to disseminating pamphlets more or less insignificant.

It is difficult to conceive the great courage and presence of mind sometimes found in men so
degraded as are the wretches who fill the office of spies.  I had an agent amongst the Swedo-Russians,
named Chefneux, whom I had always found extremely clever and correct.  Having for a long time
received no intelligence from him I became very anxious, --an anxiety which was not without
foundation.  He had, in fact, been arrested at Lauenburg, and conducted, bound, tied hand and
foot, by some Cossacks to Luneburg.  There was found on him a bulletin which he was about to
transmit to me, and he only escaped certain death by having in his possession a letter of recommendation
from a Hamburg merchant well known to M. Alopaeus, the Russian Minister in that city.  This
precaution, which I had taken before he set out, saved his life. M. Alopaeus replied to the
merchant that, in consequence of his recommendation the spy should be sent back safe and sound,
but that another time neither the recommended nor the recommender should escape so easily.
Notwithstanding this, Chefneux would certainly have paid with his head for the dangerous business
in which he was embarked but for the inconceivable coolness he displayed under the most trying
circumstances. Though the bulletin which was found upon him was addressed to M. Schramm, merchant,
they strongly suspected that it was intended for me.  They demanded of the prisoner whether
he knew me; to which he boldly replied that he had never seen me.  They endeavoured, by every
possible means, to extort a confession from him, but without success.  His repeated denials,
joined to the name of M. Schramm, created doubts in the minds of his interrogators; they hesitated
lest they should condemn an innocent man. They, however, resolved to make a last effort to
discover the truth, and Chefneux, condemned to be shot, was conducted to the plain of Luneburg.
His eyes were bandaged, and he heard the command of preparation given to the platoon, which
was to fire upon him; at that moment a man approaching him whispered in his ear, in a tone
of friendship and compassion, "They are going to fire; but I am your friend; only acknowledge
that you know M. de Bourrienne and you are safe."--"No," replied Chefneux in a firm tone; "if
I said so I should tell a falsehood."  Immediately the bandage was removed from his eyes, and
he was set at liberty.  It would be difficult to cite a more extraordinary instance of presence
of mind.

Much as I execrate the system of espionage I am nevertheless compelled to admit that the Emperor
was under the necessity of maintaining the most unremitting vigilance amidst the intrigues
which were going forward in the neighbourhood of Hamburg, especially when the English, Swedes,
and Russians were in arms, and there were the strongest grounds for suspecting the sincerity
of Prussia.

On the 5th of January 1806 the King of Sweden arrived before the gates of Hamburg.  The Senate
of that city, surrounded on all sides by English, Swedish, and Russian troops, determined to
send a deputation to congratulate the Swedish monarch, who, however, hesitated so long about
receiving this homage that fears were entertained lest his refusal should be followed by some
act of aggression.  At length, however, the deputies were admitted, and they returned sufficiently
well satisfied with their reception.

The King of Sweden then officially declared, "That all the arrangements entered into with relation
to Hanover had no reference to hint, as the Swedish army was under the immediate command of
its august sovereign."

The King, with his 6000 men, seemed inclined to play the part of the restorer of Germany, and
to make himself the Don Quixote of the treaty of Westphalia.  He threatened the Senate of Hamburg
with the whole weight of his anger, because on my application the colours which used to be
suspended over the door of the house for receiving Austrian recruits had been removed.  The
poor Senate of Hamburg was kept in constant alarm by so dangerous a neighbour.

The King of Sweden had his headquarters at Boetzenburg, on the northern bank of the Elbe. 
In order to amuse himself he sent for Dr. Gall, who was at Hamburg, where he delivered lectures
on his system of phrenology, which was rejected in the beginning by false science and prejudice,
and afterwards adopted in consequence of arguments, in my opinion, unanswerable.  I had the
pleasure of living some time with Dr. Gall, and I owe to the intimacy which subsisted between
us the honour he conferred on me by the dedication of one of his works.  I said to him, when
he departed for the headquarters of the King of Sweden, "My dear doctor, you will certainly
discover the bump of vanity."  The truth is, that had the doctor at that period been permitted
to examine the heads of the sovereigns of Europe they would have afforded very curious craniological
studies.

It was not the King of Sweden alone who gave uneasiness to Hamburg; the King of Prussia threatened
to seize upon that city, and his Minister publicly declared that it would very soon belong
to his master.  The Hamburgers were deeply afflicted at this threat; in fact, next to the loss
of their independence, their greatest misfortune would have been to fall under the dominion
of Prussia, as the niggardly fiscal system of the Prussian Government at that time would have
proved extremely detrimental to a commercial city.  Hanover, being evacuated by the French
troops, had become a kind of recruiting mart for the British army, where every man who presented
himself was enrolled, to complete the Hanoverian legion which was then about to be embodied.
The English scattered gold by handfuls.  One hundred and fifty carriages, each with six horses,
were employed in this service, which confirmed me in the belief I had previously entertained,
that the English were to join with the Russians in an expedition against Holland.  The aim
of the Anglo-Russians was to make a diversion which might disconcert the movements of the French
armies in Germany, the allies being at that time unacquainted with the peace concluded at Presburg.
Not a moment was therefore to be lost in uniting the whole of our disposable force for the
defence of Holland; but it is not of this expedition that I mean to speak at present.  I only
mention it to afford some idea of our situation at Hamburg, surrounded, as we then were, by
Swedish, English, and Russian troops.  At this period the Russian Minister at Hamburg, M. Forshmann,
became completely insane; his conduct had been more injurious than advantageous to his Government.
He was replaced by M. Alopcous, the Russian Minister at Berlin; and they could not have exchanged
a fool for a more judicious and able diplomatist.

I often received from the Minister of Marine letters said packets to transmit to the Isle of
France,(Mauritius) of which the Emperor was extremely anxious to retain possession; and I had
much trouble in finding any vessels prepared for that colony by which I could forward the Minister's
communications.  The death of Pitt and the appointment of Fox as his successor had created
a hope of peace.  It was universally known that Mr. Fox, in succeeding to his office, did not
inherit the furious hatred of the deceased Minister against France and her Emperor. There moreover
existed between Napoleon and Mr. Fox a reciprocal esteem, and the latter had shown himself
really disposed to treat.  The possibility of concluding a peace had always been maintained
by that statesman when he was in opposition to Mr. Pitt; and Bonaparte himself might have been
induced, from the high esteem he felt for Mr. Fox, to make concessions from which he would
before have recoiled.  But there were two obstacles, I may say almost insurmountable ones.
The first was the conviction on the part of England that any peace which might be made would
only be a truce, and that Bonaparte would never seriously relinquish his desire of universal
dominion.  On the other side, it was believed that Napoleon had formed the design of invading
England.  Had he been able to do so it would have been less with the view of striking a blow
at her commerce and destroying her maritime power, than of annihilating the liberty of the
press, which he had extinguished in his own dominions.  The spectacle of a free people, separated
only by six leagues of sea, was, according to him, a seductive example to the French, especially
to those among them who bent unwillingly under his yoke.

At an early period of Mr. Fox's ministry a Frenchman made the proposition to him of assassinating
the Emperor, of which information was immediately transmitted to M. de Talleyrand.  In this
despatch the Minister said that, though the laws of England did not authorise the permanent
detention of any individual not convicted of a crime, he had on this occasion taken it on himself
to secure the miscreant till such time as the French Government could be put on its guard against
his attempts. Mr. Fox said in his letter that he had at first done this individual "the honour
to take him for a spy," a phrase which sufficiently indicated the disgust with which the British
Minister viewed him.

This information was the key which opened the door to new negotiations. M. de Talleyrand was
ordered to express, in reply to the communication of Mr. Fox, that the Emperor was sensibly
affected at the index it afforded of the principles by which the British Cabinet was actuated.
Napoleon did not limit himself to this diplomatic courtesy; he deemed it a favourable occasion
to create a belief that he was actuated by a sincere love of peace.  He summoned to Paris Lord
Yarmouth, one of the most distinguished amongst the English who had been so unjustly detained
prisoners at Verdun on the rupture of the peace of Amiens.  He gave his lordship instructions
to propose to the British Government a new form of negotiations, offering to guarantee to England
the Cape of Good Hope and Malta.  Some have been inclined from this concession to praise the
moderation of Bonaparte; others to blame him for offering to resign these two places, as if
the Cape and Malta could be put in competition with the title of Emperor, the foundation of
the Kingdom of Italy, the acquisition of Genoa and of all the Venetian States, the dethronement
of the King of Naples and the gift of his kingdom to Joseph, and finally, the new partition
of Germany.  These transactions, of which Bonaparte said not a word, and from which he certainly
had no intention of departing, were all long after the treaty of Amiens.

Every day brought with it fresh proofs of insatiable ambition.  In fact, Napoleon longed to
obtain possession of the Hanse Towns.  I was, however, in the first place, merely charged to
make overtures to the Senates of each of these towns, and to point out the advantages they
would derive from the protection of Napoleon in exchange for the small sacrifice of 6,000,000
francs in his favour.  I had on this subject numerous conferences with the magistrates: they
thought the sum too great, representing, to me that the city was not so rich as formerly, because
their commerce had been much curtailed by the war; in short, the Senate declared that, with
the utmost goodwill, their circumstances would not permit them to accept the "generous proposal"
of the Emperor.

I was myself, indeed, at a loss to conceive how the absurdity of employing me to make such
a proposition was overlooked, for I had, really no advantage to offer in return to the Hanse
Towns.  Against whom did Bonaparte propose to protect them?  The truth is, Napoleon then wished
to seize these towns by direct aggression, which, however, he was not able to accomplish until
four years afterwards.

During five years I witnessed the commercial importance of these cities, and especially of
Hamburg.  Its geographical situation, on a great river navigable by large vessels to the city,
thirty leagues from the mouth of the Elbe; the complete independence it enjoyed; its municipal
regulations and paternal government, were a few amongst the many causes which had raised Hamburg
to its enviable height of prosperity.  What, in fact, was the population of these remnants
of the grand Hanseatic League of the Middle Ages?  The population of Hamburg when I was there
amounted to 90,000, and that of its small surrounding territory to 25,000.  Bremen had 36,000
inhabitants, and 9000 in its territory; the city of Lubeck, which is smaller and its territory
a little more extensive than that of Bremen, contained a population of 24,000 souls within
and 16,000 without the walls.  Thus the total population of the Hanse Towns amounted to only
200,000 individuals; and yet this handful of men carried on an extensive commerce, and their
ships ploughed every sea, from the shores of India to the frozen regions of Greenland.

The Emperor arrived at Paris towards the end of January 1806.  Having created kings in Germany
he deemed the moment favourable for surrounding his throne with new princes.  It was at this
period that he created Murat, Grand Duke of Cleves and Berg; Bernadotte, Prince of Ponte-Corvo;
M. de Talleyrand, Duke of Benevento; and his two former colleagues, Cambaceres and Lebrun,
Dukes of Parma and Piacenza.  He also gave to his sister Pauline, a short time after her second
marriage with the Prince Borghese, the title of Duchess of Guastalla.  Strange events!  who
could then have foreseen that the duchy of Cambaceres would become the refuge of a Princess
of Austria, the widowed wife of Napoleon Bonaparte? In the midst of the prosperity of the Imperial
family, when the eldest of the Emperor's brothers had ascended the throne of Naples, when Holland
was on the eve of being offered to Louis, and Jerome had exchanged his legitimate wife for
the illegitimate throne of Westphalia, the Imperial pillow was still far from being free from
anxiety.  Hostilities did not actually exist with the Continental powers; but this momentary
state of repose lacked the tranquillity of peace.  France was at war with Russia and England,
and the aspect of the Continent presented great uncertainty, while the treaty of Vienna had
only been executed in part.  In the meantime Napoleon turned his eyes towards the East.  General
Sebastiani was sent to Constantinople.  The measures be pursued and his judicious conduct justified
the choice of the Emperor.  He was adroit and conciliating, and peace with Turkey was the result
of his mission. The negotiations with England did not terminate so happily, although, after
the first overtures made to Lord Yarmouth, the Earl of Lauderdale had been sent to Paris by
Mr. Fox.  In fact, these negotiations wholly failed. The Emperor had drawn enormous sums from
Austria, without counting the vases, statues, and pictures.  With which he decorated the Louvre,
and the bronze with which he clothed the column of the Place Vendome,--in my opinion the finest
monument of his reign and the most beautiful one in Paris.  As Austria was exhausted all the
contributions imposed on her could not be paid in cash, and they gave the Emperor bills in
payment.  I received one for about 7,000,000 on Hamburg on account of the stipulations of the
treaty of Presburg.

The affairs of the Bourbon Princes became more and more unfavourable, and their finances, as
well as their chances of success, were so much diminished that about this period it was notified
to the emigrants in Brunswick that the pretender (Louis XVIII.) had no longer the means of
continuing their pensions.  This produced great consternation amongst those emigrants, many
of whom had no other means of existence; and notwithstanding their devotion to the cause of
royalty they found a pension very useful in strengthening their zeal.

     --[When Louis XVIII. returned to France, and Fouche was his Minister
     of Police, the King asked Fouche whether during his (the King's)
     exile, had not set spies over him, and who they were.  Fouche
     hesitated to reply, but the King insisting he said: "If your Majesty
     presses for an answer, it was the Due de Blacas to whom this matter
     was confided."--"And how much did you pay him?" said the King.
     "Deux cents mille livres de rents, Sire."--"Ah, so!" said the King,
     "then he has played fair; we went halves."--Henry Greville's Diary,
     p. 430.]--

Amongst those emigrants was one whose name will occupy a certain place in history; I mean Dumouriez,
of whom I have already spoken, and who had for some time employed himself in distributing pamphlets.
He was then at Stralsund; and it was believed that the King of Sweden would give him a command.
The vagrant life of this general, who ran everywhere begging employment from the enemies of
his country without being able to obtain it, subjected him to general ridicule; in fact, he
was everywhere despised.

To determine the difficulties which had arisen with regard to Holland, which Dumouriez dreamed
of conquering with an imaginary army, and being discontented besides with the Dutch for not
rigorously excluding English vessels from their ports, the Emperor constituted the Batavian
territory a kingdom under his brother Louis.  When I notified to the States of the circle of
Lower Saxony the accession of Louis Bonaparte to the throne of Holland, and the nomination
of Cardinal Fesch as coadjutor and successor of the Arch-chancellor of the Germanic Empire,
along with their official communications, the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was the only member
of the circle who forebore to reply, and I understood be had applied to the Court of Russia
to know "whether" and "how" he should reply.  At the same time he made known to the Emperor
the marriage of his daughter, the Princess Charlotte Frederica, with Prince Christian Frederick
of Denmark.

At this period it would have been difficult to foresee the way in which this union would terminate.
The Prince was young and handsome, and of an amiable disposition, which seemed to indicate
that he would prove a good husband.  As for the Princess, she was as beautiful as love; but
she was heedless and giddy; in fact, she was a spoiled child.  She adored her husband, and
during several years their union proved happy.  I had the honour of knowing them at the period
when the Duke of Mecklenburg, with his family, sought refuge at Altona.  Before leaving that
town the Duchess of Mecklenburg, a Princess of Saxony, paid a visit to Madame de Bourrienne
and loaded her with civilities.  This Princess was perfectly amiable, and was therefore generally
regretted when, two years afterwards, death snatched her from her family.  Before leaving Altona
the Duke of Mecklenburg gave some parties by way of bidding adieu to Holstein, where he had
been so kindly received; and I can never forget the distinguished reception and many kindnesses
Madame de Bourrienne and myself received from that illustrious family.

It consisted of the hereditary Prince, so distinguished by his talents and acquirements (he
was at that time the widower of a Grand Duchess of Russia, a sister of the Emperor Alexander),
of Prince Gustavus, so amiable and graceful, and of Princess Charlotte and her husband, the
Prince Royal of Denmark.

This happy couple were far from foreseeing that in two years they would be separated for ever.
The Princess was at this period in all the splendour of her beauty; several fetes were given
on her account on the banks of the Elbe, at which the Prince always opened the ball with Madame
de Bourrienne.  Notwithstanding her amiability the Princess Charlotte was no favourite at the
Danish Court.  Intrigues were formed against her.  I know not whether any foundation existed
for the calumnies spread to her disadvantage, but the Court dames accused her of great levity
of conduct, which, true or false, obliged her husband to separate from her; and at the commencement
of 1809 he sent her to Altona, attended by a chamberlain and a maid of honour.  On her arrival
she was in despair; hers was not a silent grief, for she related her story to every one.  This
unfortunate woman really attracted pity, as she shed tears for her son, three years of age,
whom she was doomed never again to behold.  But her natural levity returned; she did not always
maintain the reserve suitable to her rank, and some months afterwards was sent into Jutland,
where I believe she still lives.

The enemies of the French Government did not confine themselves to writing and publishing invectives
against it.  More than one wretch was ready to employ daggers against the Emperor.  Among this
number was a man named Louis Loizeau, recently arrived from London.  He repaired to Altona,
there to enjoy the singular privilege which that city afforded of sheltering all the ruffians,
thieves, and bankrupts who fled from the justice of their own Governments.  On the 17th of
July Loizeau presented himself to Comte de Gimel, who resided at Altona, as the agent of the
Comte de Lille.  He offered to repair to Paris and assassinate the Emperor.  Comte de Gimel
rejected the proposal with indignation; and replied, that if he had no other means of serving
the Bourbons than cowardly assassination he might go elsewhere and find confederates.  This
fact, which was communicated to me by a friend of M. de Gimel, determined me to arrest Loizeau.
Not being warranted, however, to take this step at Altona, I employed a trusty agent to keep
watch, and draw him into a quarrel the moment he should appear on the Hamburg side of a public
walk which divides that city from Altona, and deliver him up to the nearest Hamburg guard-house.
Loizeau fell into the snare; but finding that he was about to be conducted from the guardhouse
to the prison of Hamburg, and that it was at my request he had been arrested, he hastily unloosed
his cravat, and tore with his teeth the papers it contained, part of which he swallowed.  He
also endeavoured to tear some other papers which were concealed under his arm, but was prevented
by the guard.  Furious at this disappointment, he violently resisted the five soldiers who
had him in custody, and was not secured until he had been slightly wounded.  His first exclamation
on entering prison was, "I am undone!" Loizeau was removed to Paris, and, though I am ignorant
of the ultimate fate of this wretch, I am pretty certain that Fouche would take effectual means
to prevent him from doing any further mischief.

CHAPTER VI.

1806.

     Menaces of Prussia--Offer for restoring Hanover to England--Insolent
     ultimatum--Commencement of hostilities between France and Prussia--
     Battle of Auerstadt--Death of the Duke of Brunswick--Bernadotte in
     Hamburg--Davonet and Bernadotte--The Swedes at Lubeck--Major Amiel--
     Service rendered to the English Minister at Hamburg--My appointment
     of Minister for the King of Naples--New regulation of the German
     post-office--The Confederation of the North--Devices of the Hanse
     Towns--Occupation of Hamburg in the name of the Emperor--Decree of
     Berlin--The military governors of Hamburg--Brune, Michaud, and
     Bernadotte.

The moment now approached when war was about to be renewed in Germany, and in proportion as
the hopes of peace diminished Prussia redoubled her threats, which were inspired by the recollection
of the deeds of the great Frederick.  The idea of peace was hateful to Prussia.  Her measures,
which till now had been sufficiently moderate, suddenly assumed a menacing aspect on learning
that the Minister of the King of England had declared in Parliament that France had consented
to the restitution of Hanover.  The French Ministry intimated to the Prussian Government that
this was a preliminary step towards a general peace, and that a large indemnity would be granted
in return.  But the King of Prussia, who was well informed, and convinced that the House of
Hanover clung to this ancient domain, which gave to England a certain preponderance in Germany,
considered himself trifled with, and determined on war.

Under these circumstances Lord Lauderdale was recalled from Paris by his Government.  War continued
with England, and was about to commence with Prussia.  The Cabinet of Berlin sent an ultimatum
which could scarcely be regarded in any other light than a defiance, and from the well-known
character of Napoleon we may judge of his irritation at this ultimatum.

     --[The severity with which Bonaparte treated the press may be
     inferred from the case of Palm the publisher.  In 1808 Johann
     Phillip Palm, of Nuremberg, was shot by Napoleon's order for issuing
     a pamphlet against the rule of the French in Germany.]--

The Emperor, after his stay of eight months in Paris passed in abortive negotiations for peace,
set out on the 25th of September for the Rhine.

Hostilities commenced on the 10th of October 1806 between France and Prussia, and I demanded
of the Senate that a stop should be put to the Prussians recruiting.  The news of a great victory
gained by the Emperor over the Prussians on the 14th of October reached Hamburg on the 19th,
brought by some fugitives, who gave such exaggerated accounts of the loss of the French army
that it was not until the arrival of the official despatches on the 28th of October that we
knew whether to mourn or to rejoice at the victory of Jena.

The Duke of Brunswick, who was dangerously wounded at the battle of Auerstadt, arrived on the
29th of October at Altona.--[This Prince was in the seventy-second year of his age, and extremely
infirm.]--His entrance into that city afforded a striking example of the vicissitudes of fortune.
That Prince entered Altona on a wretched litter, borne by ten men, without officers, without
domestics, followed by a troop of vagabonds and children, who were drawn together by curiosity.
He was lodged in a wretched inn, and so much worn out by fatigue and the pain of his eyes that
on the day after his arrival a report of his death very generally prevailed.  Doctor Unzer
was immediately sent for to attend the unfortunate Duke, who, during the few days that he survived
his wounds, saw no one else except his wife, who arrived on the 1st of November.  He expired
on the 10th of the same month.

     --[For the mistimed but rather pathetic belief of the old dying Duke
     in the courtesy with which he and his States would be treated by the
     French, see Beugnot, tome 1. p. 80: "I feel sure that there is a
     courier of the Emperor's on the road to know how I am."]--

At this juncture Bernadotte returned to Hamburg.  I asked him how I was to account for his
conduct while he was with Davoust, who had left Nuremberg to attack the Prussian army; and
whether it was true that he had refused to march with that general, and afterwards to aid him
when he attacked the Prussians on the Weimar road.  "The letters I received," observed I, "state
that you took no part in the battle of Auerstadt; that I did not believe, but I suppose you
saw the bulletin which I received a little after the battle, and which stated that Bonaparte
said at Nuremberg, in the presence of several officers, 'Were I to bring him before a court-martial
he would be shot.  I shall say nothing to him about it, but I will take care he shall know
what I think of his behaviour.  He has too keen a sense of honour not to be aware that he acted
disgracefully."--"I think him very likely," rejoined Bernadotte, "to have made these observations.
He hates me because he knows I do not like him; but let him speak to me and he shall have his
answer.  If I am a Gascon, he is a greater one.  I might have felt piqued at receiving something
like orders from Davoust, but I did my duty."

     --[The complaints of Bernadotte's conduct on the 14th of October
     1806.  when he gave no assistance to Davoust in repulsing the main
     body of the Prussians at Aneratadt, are well known.  Jomini says
     that Davoust proposed to Bernadotte to march with him, and even
     offered him the command of the two corps.  Bernadotte refused, and
     marched away to Dornburg, where he was of no use, "his obstinacy,
     difficult to explain, nearly compromised both Davoust and the
     success of the battle;" See also Thiers (tome vii.  p.  172), who
     attributes Bernadotte's conduct to a profound aversion for Davoust
     conceived on the most frivolous grounds.  Bernadotte had frequently
     given cause of complaint to Napoleon in the two campaigns of 1806
     and 1806.  In the movement on Vienna Napoleon considered he showed
     want of activity and of zeal.  These complaints seem to have been
     made in good faith, for in a letter to Bernadotte's brother-in-law,
     Joseph, Napoleon suggests that health may have been the causes (Du
     Cases, tome i.  p. 322).  Bernadotte was equally unfortunate in
     putting in his appearance too late at Eylan (see Due de Rovigo's
     Memoirs, tome ii.  p. 48), and also incurred the displeasure of
     Napoleon at Wagram (see later on).]--

In the beginning of November the Swedes entered Lubeck; but on the 8th of that month the town
was taken by assault, and the Swedes, as well as the rest of the corps which had escaped from
Jena, were made prisoners.

A troop of Prussians had advanced within four leagues of Hamburg, and that town had already
prepared for a vigorous resistance, in case they should attempt an entrance, when Major Amiel
attacked them at Zollenspieker and made some prisoners.  Hamburg was, however, threatened with
another danger, for Major Amiel expressed his intention of entering with all his prisoners,
notwithstanding the acknowledged neutrality of the town.  Amiel was a partisan leader in the
true sense of the word; he fought rather on his own account than with the intention of contributing
to the success of the operations of the army.  His troop did not consist of more than forty
men, but that was more than sufficient to spread terror and devastation in the surrounding
villages.  He was a bold fellow, and when, with his handful of men, he threw himself upon Hamburg,
the worthy inhabitants thought he had 20,000 troops with him.  He had pillaged every place
through which he passed, and brought with him 300 prisoners, and a great many horses he had
taken on his road.  It was night when he presented himself at the gates of the city, which
he entered alone, having left his men and booty at the last village.  He proceeded to the French
Embassy.  I was not there at the time, but I was sent for, and about seven o'clock in the evening
I had my first interview with the Major.  He was the very, beau ideal of a bandit, and would
have been an admirable model for a painter.  I was not at all surprised to hear that on his
arrival his wild appearance and huge mustachios had excited some degree of terror among those
who were in the salon.  He described his exploits on the march, and did not disguise his intention
of bringing his troops into Hamburg next day.  He talked of the Bank and of pillage.  I tried
for some time to divert him from this idea, but without effect, and at length said to him,
"Sir, you know that this is not the way the Emperor wishes to be served.  During the seven
years that I have been about him, I have invariably heard him express his indignation against
those who aggravate the misery which war naturally brings in her train.  It is the express
wish of the Emperor that no damage, no violence whatever, shall be committed on the city or
territory of Hamburg."  These few words produced a stronger effect than any entreaties I could
have used, for the mere name of the Emperor made even the boldest tremble, and Major Amiel
next thought of selling his booty. The Senate were so frightened at the prospect of having
Amiel quartered upon them that to get rid of him they determined to purchase his booty at once,
and even furnished him with guards for his prisoners.  I did not learn till some time afterwards
that among the horses Major Amiel had seized upon the road were those of the Countess Walmoden.
Had I known this fact at the time I should certainly have taken care to have had them restored
to her.  Madame Walmoden was then a refugee at Hamburg, and between her and my family a close
intimacy existed.  On the very day, I believe, of the Major's departure the Senate wrote me
a letter of thanks for the protection I afforded the town.

Before the commencement of the Prussian campaign, while anxiety was entertained respecting
the designs of the Cabinet of Berlin, my task was not an easy one.  I exerted all my efforts
to acquaint the French Government with what was passing on the Spree.  I announced the first
intelligence of an unexpected movement which had taken place among the Prussian troops cantoned
in the neighbourhood of Hamburg.  They suddenly evacuated Lauenburg, Platzburg, Haarburg, Stade,
Twisenfelth, and Cuxhaven.  This extraordinary movement gave rise to a multitude of surmises.
I was not wrong when I informed the French Government that, according to every probability,
Prussia was about to declare hostilities against France, and to enter into an alliance with
England.

I much regretted that my situation did not allow me more frequent opportunities of meeting
Mr. Thornton, the English Minister to the circle of Lower Saxony.  However; I saw him sometimes,
and had on two different occasions the opportunity of rendering him some service.  Mr. Thornton
had requested me to execute a little private business for him, the success of which depended
on the Emperor.  I made the necessary communication to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, adding
in my letter that Mr. Thornton's conduct towards the French who had come in any way in contact
with him had ever been just and liberal, and that I should receive great pleasure in being
able to announce to him the success of his application.  His request was granted.

On another occasion Mr. Thornton applied to me for my services, and I had once more the pleasure
of rendering them.  He wished to procure some information respecting an Englishman named Baker,
who had gone to Terracina, in the Campagna di Roma, for the benefit of sea-bathing.  He was
there arrested, without any cause assigned, by order of the commandant of the French troops
in Terracina.  The family of Mr. Baker, not having heard from him for some months, became very
uneasy respecting him, for they had not the least idea of his arrest.  His relations applied
to Mr. Thornton, and that gentleman, notwithstanding the circumstances which, as I have stated,
prevented our frequent intercourse, hesitated not a moment in requesting me to furnish him
with some information respecting his countryman. Of system to leagues. To Regulator, and coadjutor,

Subsequently all this population are fall from settlers.
  In our first war against France, at the commencement
of your Revolution, we fought for questions respecting the rights of sovereigns, for which,
I assure you, I care very little; but now the case is altered, the whole population of Prussia
makes common cause with its Government.  The people fight in defence of their homes, and reverses
destroy our armies without changing the spirit of the nation.  I rely confidently on the future
because I foresee that fortune will not always favour your Emperor.  It is impossible; but
the time will come when all Europe, humbled by his exactions, and impatient of his depredations,
will rise up against him.  The more he enslaves nations, the more terrible will be the reaction
when they break their chains. It cannot be denied that he is tormented with an insatiable desire
of acquiring new territories.  To the war of 1805 against Austria and Russia the present war
has almost immediately succeeded.  We have fallen. Prussia is occupied; but Russia still remains
undefeated.  I cannot foresee what will be the termination of the war; but, admitting that
the issue should be favourable to you, it will end only to break out again speedily.  If we
continue firm, France, exhausted by her conquests, must in the end fall.  You may be certain
of it.  You wish for peace. Recommend it!  By so doing You will give strong proofs of love
for your country."

In this strain Blucher constantly spoke to me; and as I never thought it right to play the
part of the public functionary in the drawing-room I replied to him with the reserve necessary
in my situation.  I could not tell him how much my anticipations frequently coincided with
his; but I never hesitated to express to him how much I wished to see a reasonable peace concluded.

Blucher's arrival at Hamburg was preceded by that of Prince Paul of Wutrtemberg, the second
son of one of the two kings created by Napoleon, whose crowns were not yet a year old.  This
young Prince, who was imbued with the ideas of liberty and independence which then prevailed
in Germany, had taken a headlong step.  He had quitted Stuttgart to serve in the Prussian campaign
without having asked his father's permission, which inconsiderate proceeding might have drawn
Napoleon's anger upon the King of Wurtemberg.  The King of Prussia advanced Prince Paul to
the rank of general, but he was taken prisoner at the very commencement of hostilities.  Prince
Paul was not, as has been erroneously stated, conducted to Stuttgart by a captain of gendarmerie.
He came to Hamburg, where I received many visits from him.  He did not yet possess very definite
ideas as to what he wished; for after he was made prisoner he expressed to me his strong desire
to enter the French service, and often asked me to solicit for him an interview with the Emperor.
He obtained this interview, and remained for a long time in Paris, where I know he has frequently
resided since the Restoration.

The individuals whom I had to observe in Hamburg gave me much less trouble than our neighbours
at Altona.  The number of the latter had considerably augmented, since the events of the war
had compelled a great number of emigrants who had taken refuge at Munster to leave that town.
They all proceeded to Altona.  Conquered countries became as dangerous to them as the land
which they had forsaken.  The most distinguished amongst the individuals assembled at Altona
were Vicomte de Sesmaisons, the Bailly d'Hautefeuille, the Duchess of Luxembourg, the Marquis
de Bonnard, the Due d'Aumont (then Due de Villequier), the wife of Marshal de Brogue and her
daughter, Cardinal de Montmorency, Madame de Cosse, her two daughters and her son (and a priest),
and the Bishop of Boulogne.

Bonaparte stayed long enough at Berlin to permit of the arrival of a deputation from the French
Senate to congratulate him on his first triumphs.  I learned that in this instance the Senatorial
deputation, departing from its accustomed complaisance, ventured not to confine itself to compliments
and felicitations, but went so far as to interfere with the Emperor's plan of the campaign,
to speak of the danger that might be incurred and finally to express a desire to in passing
the Oder, see peace concluded.  Napoleon received this communication with a very bad grace.
He thought the Senators very bold to meddle with his affairs, treated the conscript fathers
of France as if they had been inconsiderate youths, protested, according to custom, his sincere
love of peace, and told the deputation that it was Prussia, backed by Russia, and not he, who
wished for war!

All the German Princes who had taken part against Napoleon fled to Altona after the battle
of Jena with as much precipitation as the emigrants themselves.  The Hereditary Prince of Weimar,
the Duchess of Holstein, Prince Belmonte-Pignatelli, and a multitude of other persons distinguished
for rank and fortune, arrived there almost simultaneously. Among the persons who took refuge
in Altona were some intriguers, of whom Fauche-Borel was one.  I remember receiving a report
respecting a violent altercation which Fauche had the audacity to enter into with Comte de
Gimel because he could not extort money from the Count in payment of his intrigues.  Comte
de Gimel had only funds for the payment of pensions, and, besides, he had too much sense to
suppose there was any utility in the stupid pamphlets of Fauche-Borel, and therefore he dismissed
him with a refusal.  Fauche was insolent, which compelled Comte de Gimel to send him about
his business as he deserved.  This circumstance, which was first communicated to me in a report,
has since been confirmed by a person who witnessed the scene.  Fauche-Borel merely passed through
Hamburg, and embarked for London on board the same ship which took Lord Morpeth back to England.

     --[Louis Fauche-Borel (1762-1829), a Swiss who devoted himself to
     the cause of the Royalists.  As Louis stepped on the shore of France
     in 1814, Fauche-Borel was ready to assist him from the boat, and was
     met with the gracious remark that he was always at hand when a
     service was required.  His services were however left unrewarded]--

CHAPTER VIII.

1806.

     Alarm of the city of Hamburg--The French at Bergdorf--Favourable
     orders issued by Bernadotte--Extortions in Prussia--False
     endorsements--Exactions of the Dutch--Napoleon's concern for his
     wounded troops--Duroc's mission to the King of Prussia--Rejection of
     the Emperor's demands--My negotiations at Hamburg--Displeasure of
     the King of Sweden--M. Netzel and M. Wetteratedt.

At this critical moment Hamburg was menaced on all sides; the French even occupied a portion
of its territory.  The French troops, fortunately for the country, were attached to the corps
commanded by the Prince de Ponte- Corvo.  This military occupation alarmed the town of Hamburg,
to which, indeed, it proved very injurious.  I wrote to Marshal Bernadotte on the subject.
The grounds on which the Senate appealed for the evacuation of their territory were such that
Bernadotte could not but acknowledge their justice.  The prolonged stay of the French troops
in the bailiwick of Bergdorf, which had all the appearance of an occupation, might have led
to the confiscation of all Hamburg property in England, to the laying an embargo on the vessels
of the Republic, and consequently to the ruin of a great part of the trade of France and Holland,
which was carried on under the flag of Hamburg.  There was no longer any motive for occupying
the bailiwick of Bergdorf when there were no Prussians in that quarter.  It would have been
an absurd misfortune that eighty men stationed in that bailiwick should, for the sake of a
few louis and a few ells of English cloth, have occasioned the confiscation of Hamburg, French,
and Dutch property to the amount of 80,000,000 francs.

Marshal Bernadotte replied to me on the 16th of November, and said, "I hasten to inform you
that I have given orders for the evacuation of the bailiwick of Bergdorf and all the Hamburg
territory.  If you could obtain from the Senate of Hamburg, by the 19th of this month, two
or three thousand pairs of shoes, you would oblige me greatly.  They shall be paid for in goods
or in money."

I obtained what Bernadotte required from the Senate, who knew his integrity, while they were
aware that that quality was not the characteristic of all who commanded the French armies!
What extortions took place during the occupation of Prussia!  I will mention one of the means
which, amongst others, was employed at Berlin to procure money. Bills of exchange were drawn,
on which endorsements were forged, and these bills were presented to the bankers on whom they
were purported to be drawn.  One day some of these forged bills to a large amount were presented
to Messrs. Mathiesen and Silleine of Hamburg, who, knowing the endorsement to be forged, refused
to cash them.  The persons who presented the bills carried their impudence so far as to send
for the gendarmes, but the bankers persisted in their refusal.  I was informed of this almost
incredible scene, which had drawn together a great number of people.  Indignant at such audacious
robbery, I instantly proceeded to the spot and sent away the gendarmes, telling them it was
not their duty to protect robbers, and that it was my business to listen to any just claims
which might be advanced.  Under Clarke's government at Berlin the inhabitants were subjected
to all kinds of oppression and exaction. Amidst these exactions and infamous proceedings, which
are not the indispensable consequences of war, the Dutch generals distinguished themselves
by a degree of rapacity which brought to mind the period of the French Republican peculations
in Italy.  It certainly was not their new King who set the example of this conduct.  His moderation
was well known, and it was as much the result of his disposition as of his honest principles.
Louis Bonaparte, who was a King in spite of himself, afforded an example of all that a good
man could suffer upon a usurped throne.

When the King of Prussia found himself defeated at every point he bitterly repented having
undertaken a war which had delivered his States into Napoleon's power in less time than that
in which Austria had fallen the preceding year.  He wrote to the Emperor, soliciting a suspension
of hostilities.  Rapp was present when Napoleon received the King of Prussia's letter.  "It
is too late," said he; "but, no matter, I wish to stop the effusion of blood; I am ready to
agree to anything which is not prejudicial to the honour or interests of the nation."  Then
calling Duroc, he gave him orders to visit the wounded, and see that they wanted for nothing.
He added, "Visit every man on my behalf; give them all the consolation of which they stand
in need; afterwards find the King of Prussia, and if he offers reasonable proposals let me
know them."

Negotiations were commenced, but Napoleon's conditions were of a nature which was considered
inadmissible.  Prussia still hoped for assistance from the Russian forces.  Besides, the Emperor's
demands extended to England, who at that moment had no reason to accede to the pretensions
of France.  The Emperor wished England to restore to France the colonies which she bad captured
since the commencement of the war, that Russia should restore to(o) the Porte Moldavia and
Wallachia, which she then occupied; in short, he acted upon the advice which some tragedy-king
gives to his ambassador: "Demand everything, that you may obtain nothing."  The Emperor's demands
were, in fact, so extravagant that it was scarcely possible he himself could entertain the
hope of their being accepted.  Negotiations, alternately resumed and abandoned, were carried
on with coldness on both sides until the moment when England prevailed on Russia to join Prussia
against France; they then altogether ceased: and it was for the sake of appearing to wish for
their renewal, on bases still more favourable to France, that Napoleon sent Duroc to the King
of Prussia.  Duroc found the King at Osterode, on the other side of the Vistula.  The only
answer he received from His Majesty was, "The time is passed;" which was very much like Napoleon's
observation; "It is too late."

Whilst Duroc was on his mission to the King of Prussia I was myself negotiating at Hamburg.
Bonaparte was very anxious to detach Sweden from the coalition, and to terminate the war with
her by a separate treaty. Sweden, indeed, was likely to be very useful to him if Prussia, Russia,
and England should collect a considerable mass of troops in the north. Denmark was already
with us, and by gaining over Sweden also the union of those two powers might create a diversion,
and give serious alarm to the coalition, which would be obliged to concentrate its principal
force to oppose the attack of the grand army in Poland.  The opinions of M. Peyron, the Swedish
Minister at Hamburg, were decidedly opposed to the war in which his sovereign was engaged with
France.  I was sorry that this gentleman left Hamburg upon leave of absence for a year just
at the moment I received my instructions from the Emperor upon this subject. M. Peyron was
succeeded by M. Netzel, and I soon had the pleasure of perceiving that his opinions corresponded
in every respect with those of his predecessor.

As soon as he arrived M. Netzel sought an interview to speak to me on the subject of the Swedes,
who had been taken prisoners on the Drave.  He entreated me to allow the officers to return
to Sweden on their parole. I was anxious to get Netzel's demand acceded to, and availed myself
of that opportunity to lead him gradually to the subject of my instructions. I had good reason
to be satisfied with the manner in which he received my first overtures.  I said nothing to
him of the justice of which he was not previously convinced.  I saw he understood that his
sovereign would have everything to gain by a reconciliation with France, and he told me that
all Sweden demanded peace.  Thus encouraged, I told him frankly that I was instructed to treat
with him.  M. Netzel assured me that M. de Wetterstedt, the King of Sweden's private secretary,
with whom he was intimate, and from whom he showed me several letters, was of the same opinion
on the subject as himself.  He added, that he had permission to correspond with the King, and
that he would; write the same evening to his sovereign and M.. de Wetterstedt to acquaint them
with our conversation.

It will be perceived, from what I have stated, that no negotiation was ever commenced under
more favourable auspices; but who could foresee what turn the King of Sweden would take?  That
unlucky Prince took M. Netzel's letter in very ill part, and M. de Wetterstedt himself received
peremptory orders to acquaint M. Netzel with his sovereign's displeasure at his having presumed
to visit a French Minster, and, above all, to enter into a political conversation with him,
although it was nothing more than conversation.  The King did not confine himself to reproaches;
M. Netzel came in great distress to inform me he had received orders to quit Hamburg immediately,
without even awaiting the arrival of his successor.  He regarded his disgrace as complete.
I had the pleasure of seeing M. Netzel again in 1809 at Hamburg, where he was on a mission
from King Charles XIII.

CHAPTER IX.

1806

     The Continental system--General indignation excited by it--Sale of
     licences by the French Government--Custom-house system at Hamburg--
     My letter to the Emperor--Cause of the rupture with Russia--
     Bernadotte's visit to me--Trial by court-martial for the purchase of
     a sugar-loaf--Davoust and the captain "rapporteur"--Influence of the
     Continental system on Napoleon's fall.

I have a few remarks to make on the famous Continental system, which was a subject of such
engrossing interest.  I had, perhaps, better opportunities than any other person of observing
the fraud and estimating the fatal consequences of this system.  It took its rise during the
war in 1806, and was brought into existence by a decree; dated from Berlin. The project was
conceived by weak counsellors, who; perceiving the Emperor's just indignation at the duplicity
of England, her repugnance to enter, into negotiations with him, and her constant endeavours
to raise enemies against France, prevailed upon him to issue the decree, which I could only
regard as an act of madness and tyranny.  It was not a decree, but fleets, that were wanting.
Without a navy it was ridiculous to declare the British Isles in a state of blockade, whilst
the English fleets were in fact blockading all the French ports.  This declaration was, however,
made in the Berlin Decree.  This is what was called the Continental system! which, in plain
terms, was nothing but a system of fraud and pillage.

One can now scarcely conceive how Europe could for a single day endure that fiscal tyranny
which extorted exorbitant prices for articles which the habits of three centuries had rendered
indispensable to the poor as well as to the rich.  So little of truth is there in the pretence
that this system had for its sole and exclusive object to prevent the sale of English goods,
that licences for their disposal were procured at a high price by whoever was rich enough to
pay for them.  The number and quality of the articles exported from France were extravagantly
exaggerated.  It was, indeed, necessary to take out some of the articles is compliance with
the Emperor's wishes, but they were only thrown into the sea.  And yet no one had the honesty
to tell the Emperor that England sold on the continent but bought scarcely anything.  The speculation
in licences was carried to a scandalous extent only to enrich a few, and to satisfy the short-sighted
views of the contrivers of the system.

This system proves what is written in the annals of the human heart and mind, that the cupidity
of the one is insatiable, and the errors of the other incorrigible.  Of this I will cite an
example, though it refers to a period posterior to the origin of the Continental system.  In
Hamburg, in 1811, under Davoust's government, a poor man had well-nigh been shot for having
introduced into the department of the Elbe a small loaf of sugar for the use of his family,
while at the same moment Napoleon was perhaps signing a licence for the importation of a million
of sugar- loaves.

     --[In this same year (1811) Murat, as King of Naples, not only
     winked at the infringement of the Continental system, but almost
     openly broke the law himself.  His troops in Calabria and all round
     his immense line sea coast, carried on an active trade with Sicilian
     and English smugglers.  This was so much the case that an officer
     never set out from Naples to join, without, being, requested by his
     wife, his relations or friends, to bring them some English muslins,
     some sugar and coffee, together with a few needles, pen-knives, and
     razors.  Some of the Neapolitan officers embarked in really large
     commercial operations, going shares with the custom house people who
     were there to enforce the law, and making their soldiers load and
     unload the contraband vessels.  The Comte de -----, a French officer
     on Murat's staff, was very noble, but very poor, and excessively
     extravagant.  After making several vain efforts to set him up in the
     world, the King told him one day he would give him the command of
     the troops round the Gulf of Salerno; adding that the devil was in
     it if he could not make a fortune in such a capital smuggling
     district, in a couple of years.--The Count took the hint, and did
     make a fortune.--Editor 1836 edition.]--

Smuggling on a small scale was punished with death, whilst the Government themselves carried
it on extensively.  The same cause filled the Treasury with money, and the prisons with victims:

The custom-house laws of this period, which waged open war against rhubarb, and armed the coasts
of the Continent against the introduction of senna, did not save the Continental system from
destruction.  Ridicule attended the installation of the odious prevotal courts.  The president
of the Prevotal Court at Hamburg, who was a Frenchman, delivered an address, in which he endeavoured
to prove that in the time of the Ptolemies there had existed extraordinary fiscal tribunals,
and that it was to those Egypt owed her prosperity.  Terror was thus introduced by the most
absurd folly.  The ordinary customhouse officers, formerly so much abhorred in Hamburg, declared
with reason that they would soon be regretted, and than the difference between them and the
prevotal courts would soon be felt.  Bonaparte's counsellors led him to commit the folly of
requiring that a ship which had obtained a licence should export merchandise equivalent to
that of the colonial produce to be imported under the authority of the licence.  What was the
consequence?  The speculators bought at a low price old stores of silk-which change of fashion
had made completely unsaleable, and as those articles were prohibited in England they were
thrown into the sea without their loss being felt.  The profits of the speculation made ample
amends for the sacrifice.  The Continental system was worthy only of the ages of ignorance
and barbarism, and had it been admissible in theory, was impracticable in application.

  The captain
"rapporteur" of a court-martial allowed a poor peasant to escape the punishment due to the
offence of having bought a loaf of sugar beyond the custom-house barrier.  This officer was
some time afterwards at a dinner given by Marshal Davoust; the latter said to him, "You have
a very scrupulous conscience, sir; go to headquarters and you will find an order there for
you."  This order sent him eighty leagues from Hamburg.  It is necessary to have witnessed,
as I have, the numberless vexations and miseries occasioned by the unfortunate Continental
system to understand the mischief its authors did in Europe, and how much that mischief contributed
to Napoleon's fall.

     --[The so-called Continental system was framed by Napoleon in
     revenge for the English very extended system of blockades, after
     Trafalgar had put it out of his power to attempt to keep the seas.
     By these decrees all ports occupied by the French were closed to the
     English, and all English goods were to be destroyed wherever found
     in any country occupied by the French.  All States under French
     influence had to adopt this system.  It must be remembered that
     Napoleon eventually held or enforced his system on all the
     coastlines of Europe, except that of Spain and Turkey; but as
     Bourrienne shows the plan of giving licences to break his own system
     was too lucrative to be resisted by him, or, still more, by his
     officers.  For the working of the system in the occupied lands,
     Laffite the banker told Savary it was a grand idea, but
     impracticable (Savary, tome v.  p.  110).  The Emperor Alexander is
     reported to have said, after visiting England in 1814, that he
     believed the system would have reduced England if it had lasted
     another year.  The English, who claimed the right of blockading any
     coast with but little regard to the effectiveness of the blockade,
     retaliated by orders in Council, the chief of which are dated 7th
     January 1807, and 11th November 1807, by which no ships of any power
     were allowed to trade between any French ports, or the ports of any
     country closed to England.  Whatever the real merits of the system,
     and although it was the cause of war between the United States and
     England, its execution did most to damage France and Napoleon, and
     to band all Europe against it.  It is curious that even in 1831 a
     treaty had to be made to settle the claims of the United States on
     France for unjust seizures under these decrees.]--

Bonaparte was not only beyond all comparison the greatest captain of modern times, but he may
be said to have wrought a complete change in the art of war.  Before his time the most able
generals regulated the fighting season by the almanac.  It was customary in Europe to brave
the cannon's mouth only from the first fine days of spring to the last fine days of autumn;
and the months of rain, snow, and frost were passed in what were called winter quarters.  Pichegru,
in Holland, had set the example of indifference to temperature.  At Austerlitz, too, Bonaparte
had braved the severity of winter; this answered his purpose well, and he adopted the same
course in 1806.  His military genius and activity seemed to increase, and, proud of his troops,
he determined to commence a winter campaign in a climate more rigorous than any in which he
had yet fought. The men, chained to his destiny, were now required to brave the northern blast,
as they had formerly braved the vertical sun of Egypt.  Napoleon, who, above all generals,
was remarkable for the choice of his fields of battle, did not wish to wait tranquilly until
the Russian army, which was advancing towards Germany, should come to measure its strength
with him in the plains of conquered Prussia; he resolved to march to meet it, and to reach
it before it should arose the Vistula; but before he left Berlin to explore and conqueror,
Poland and the confines of Russia; he addressed a proclamation to his troops, in which he stated
all that had hitherto been achieved by the French army, and at the same time announced his
future intentions.  It was especially advisable that he should march forward, for, had he waited
until the Russians had passed the Vistula, there could probably have been no winter campaign,
and he would have been obliged either to take up miserable winter quarters between the Vistula
and the Oder, or to recross the Oder to combat the enemy in Prussia. Napoleon's military genius
and indefatigable activity served him admirably on this occasion, and the proclamation just
alluded to, which was dated from Berlin before his departure from Charlottenburg; proves that
he did not act fortuitously, as he frequently did, but that his calculations were well-made.

     --[Before leaving the capital of Prussia Bonaparte stole from the
     monument, of Frederick the Great his sword and military orders.  He
     also plundered the galleries of Berlin and Potsdam of their best
     pictures and statues, thus continuing the system he had began is
     Italy.  All those things he sent to Paris as trophies of victory and
     glory.--Editor of as 1836 edition.]

A rapid and immense impulse given to great masses of men by the, will of a single individual
may produce transient lustre and dazzle the eyes of the multitude; but when, at a distance
from the theatre of glory, we flee only the melancholy results which have been produced.  The
genius of conquest can only be regarded as the genius of destruction.  What a sad picture was
often presented to my eyes!  I was continually doomed to hear complaints of the general distress,
and to execute orders which augmented the immense sacrifices already made by the city of Hamburg.
Thus, for example, the Emperor desired me to furnish him with 50,000 cloaks which I immediately
did.  I felt the importance of such an order with the approach of winter, and in a climate--the
rigour of which our troops had not yet encountered.  I also received orders to seize at Lubeck
(Which town, as I have already stated, had been alternately taken and retaken try Blucher and
Bernadotte) 400,000 lasts of corn,--[A last weighs 2000 kilogrammes]--and to send them to Magdeburg.
This corn belonged to Russia.  Marshal Mortier, too, had seized some timber for building, which
also belonged to Russia; and which was estimated at 1,400,000 francs.

Meanwhile our troops continued to advance with such rapidity that before the end of November
Murat arrived at Warsaw, at the head of the advanced guard of the Grand Army, of which, he
had the command.  The Emperor's headquarters, were then at Posen, and, he received deputations
from all parts soliciting the re-establishment and independence of the Kingdom of Poland.

Rapp informed me that after receiving the deputation from Warsaw the Emperor said to him, "I
love the Poles; their enthusiastic character pleases me; I should like to make them independent,
but that is a difficult matter.  Austria, Russia, and Prussia have all had a slice of the cake;
when the match is once kindled who knows where, the conflagration may stop?  My first duty,
is towards France, which I must not sacrifice to Poland; we must refer this matter to the sovereign
of all things--Time, he will presently show us what we must do."  Had Sulkowsky lived Napoleon
might have recollected what he had said to him in Egypt, and, in all probability he would have
raised up a power, the dismemberment of which; towards the close of the last century, began
to overturn the political equilibrium which had subsisted in Europe since the peace of Westphalia
in 1648.

It was at the headquarters at Posen that Duroc rejoined the Emperor after his mission to the
King of Prussia.  His carriage overturned on the way, and he had the misfortune to break his
collar-bone.  All the letters I received were nothing but a succession of complaints on the
bad state of the roads.  Our troops were absolutely fighting in mud, and it was with extreme
difficulty that the artillery and caissons of the army could be moved along.  M. de Talleyrand
had been summoned to headquarters by the Emperor, in the expectation of treating for peace,
and I was informed that his carriage stuck in the mud and he was detained on his journey for
twelve hours.  A soldier having asked one of the persons in M. de Talleyrand's suite who the
traveller was, was informed that he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  "Ah! bah!"  said
the soldier, "why does he come with his diplomacy to such a devil of a country as this?"

The Emperor entered Warsaw on the 1st of January 1807.  Most of the reports which he had received
previous to his entrance had concurred in describing the dissatisfaction of the troops, who
for some time had had to contend with bad roads, bad weather, and all aorta of privations.'
Bonaparte said to the generals who informed him that the enthusiasm of his troops had been
succeeded by dejection and discontent, "Does their spirit fail them when they come in sight
of the enemy?"--"No, Sire."-- "I knew it; my troops are always the same."  Then turning to
Rapp he said, "I must rouse them;" and he dictated the following proclamation:

     SOLDIERS--It is a year this very hour since you were on the field of
     Austerlitz, where the Russian battalions fled in disorder, or
     surrendered up their arms to their conquerors.  Next day proposals,
     of peace were talked of; but they were deceptive.  No sooner had the
     Russians escaped, by perhaps, blamable generosity from the disasters
     of the third coalition than they contrived a fourth.  But the ally
     on whose tactics they founded their principal hope was no more.  His
     capital, his fortresses; his magazines; his arsenals, 280 flags, and
     700 field-pieces have fallen into our power.  The Oder, the Wartha,
     the deserts of Poland, and the inclemency of the season have not for
     a moment retarded your progress.  You have braved all; surmounted
     all; every obstacle has fled at your approach.  The Russians have in
     vain endeavoured to defend the capital of ancient and illustrious
     Poland.  The French eagle hovers over the Vistula.  The brave and
     unfortunate Poles, on beholding you, fancied they saw the legions of
     Sobieski, returning from their memorable expedition.

     Soldiers, we will not lay down our arms until a general peace has
     secured the power of our allies and restored to us our colonies and
     our freedom of trade.  We have gained on the Elbe and the Oder,
     Pondicherry, our Indian establishments, the Cape of Good Hope, and
     the Spanish colonies.  Why should the Russians have the right of
     opposing destiny and thwarting our just designs?  They and we are
     still the soldiers who fought at Austerlitz.

Rapp thus describes the entrance of the French into Warsaw, and adds a few anecdotes connected
with that event:

     "At length we entered the Polish capital.  The King of Naples had
     preceded us, and had driven the Russians from the city.  Napoleon
     was received with enthusiasm.  The Poles thought that the moment of
     their regeneration had arrived, and that their wishes were
     fulfilled.  It would be difficult to describe the joy thus evinced,
     and the respect with which they treated us.  The French troops,
     however, were not quite so well pleased; they manifested the
     greatest repugnance to crossing the Vistula.  The idea of want and
     bad weather had inspired them with the greatest aversion to Poland,
     and they were inexhaustible, in their jokes on the country."

When Bonaparte dictated his proclamations--and how many have I not written from his dictation!--he
was for the moment inspired, and he evinced all the excitement which distinguishes the Italian
improvisatori. To follow him it was necessary to write with inconceivable rapidity. When I
have read over to him what he has dictated I have often known him to smile triumphantly at
the effect which he expected any particular phrase would produce.  In general his proclamations
turned on three distinct points--(1) Praising his soldiers for what they had done; (2) pointing
out to them what they had yet to do; and (3) abusing his enemies.  The proclamation to which
I have just now alluded was circulated profusely through Germany, and it is impossible to conceive
the effect it produced. on the whole army.  The corps stationed in the rear burned too pass,
by forced marches, the space which still separated them from headquarters; and those who were
nearer the Emperor forgot their fatigues and privations and were only anxious to encounter
the enemy.  They frequently could not understand what Napoleon said in these proclamations;
but no matter for that, they would have followed him cheerfully barefooted and without provisions.
Such was the enthusiasm, or rather the fanaticism, which Napoleon could inspire among his troops
when he thought proper to rouse them, as he termed it.

When, on a former occasion, I spoke of the Duke of, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and his family, I
forgot a circumstance respecting my intercourse with him which now occurs to my memory.  When,
on his expulsion from his States, after the battle of Jena, he took refuge in Altona, he requested,
through the medium of his Minister at Hamburg, Count von Plessen, that I would give him permission
occasionally to visit that city.  This permission I granted without hesitation; but the Duke
observed no precaution in his visits, and I made some friendly observations to him on the subject.
I knew the object of his visits.  It was a secret connection in Hamburg; but in consequence
of my observations he removed the lady to Altona, and assured me that he adopted that determination
to avoid committing me.  He afterwards came very seldom to Hamburg; but as we were on the best
understanding with Denmark I frequently saw his daughter, and son-in-law, who used to visit
me at a house I had in Holstein, near Altona.

There I likewise saw, almost every day, the Duke of Weimar, an excellent old man.  I had the
advantage of being on such terms of intimacy with him that my house was in some measure his.
He also had lost his States.  I was so happy as to contribute to their restitution, for my
situation enabled me to exercise some influence on the political indulgences or severities
of the Government. (Hutchinson'prince of Algonquian cohort, Vol. I sat., occasion.

  His name was Butler, and he had been sent from England to the Continent
as a spy upon the French Government.  He immediately came to me, complaining of pretended enemies
and unjust treatment.  He told me he had the greatest wish to serve the Emperor, and that he
would make any sacrifice to prove his fidelity. The real motive of his change of party was,
as it is with all such men, merely the hope of a higher reward.  Most extraordinary were the
schemes he adopted to prevent his old employers from suspecting that he was serving new ones.
To me he continually repeated how happy he was to be revenged on his enemies in London.  He
asked me to allow him to go to Paris to be examined by the Minister of Police.  The better
to keep up the deception he requested that on his arrival in Paris he might be confined in
the Temple, and that there might be inserted in the French journals an announcement in the
following terms:

     "John Butler, commonly called Count Butler, has just been arrested
     and sent to Paris under a good escort by the French Minister at
     Hamburg."

At the expiration of a few weeks Butler, having received his instruction's, set out for London,
but by way of precaution he said it would be well to publish in the journals another announcement;
which was as follows:

     "John Butler, who has been arrested in Hamburg as an English agent,
     and conveyed to Paris, is ordered to quit France and the territories
     occupied by the French armies and their allies, and not to appear
     there again until the general peace."

In England Butler enjoyed the honours of French prosecution.  He was regarded as a victim who
deserved all the confidence of the enemies of France.  He furnished Fouche with a considerable
amount of information, and he was fortunate enough to escape being hanged.

Notwithstanding the pretended necessity of employing secret agents, Bonaparte was unwilling
that, even under that pretext, too many communications should be established between France
and England: Fouche, nevertheless, actively directed the evolutions of his secret army.  Ever
ready to seize on anything that could give importance to the police and encourage the suspicions
of the Emperor, Fouche wrote to me that the government had received certain--information that
many Frenchmen traveling for commercial houses in France were at Manchester purchasing articles
of English manufacture.  This was true; but how was it to be prevented?  These traveling clerks
passed through Holland, where they easily procured a passage to England.

Louis Bonaparte, conceiving that the King of Holland ought to sacrifice the interests of his
new subjects to the wishes of his brother, was at first very lenient as to the disastrous Continental
system.  But at this Napoleon soon manifested his displeasure, and about the end of the year
1806 Louis was reduced to the necessity of ordering the strict observance of the blockade.
The facility with which the travelers of French commercial houses passed from Holland to England
gave rise to other alarms on the part of the French Government.  It was said that since Frenchmen
could so easily pass from the Continent to Great Britain, the agents of the English Cabinet
might, by the same means, find their way to the Continent.  Accordingly the consuls were directed
to keep a watchful eye, not only upon individuals who evidently came from England, but upon
those who might by any possibility come from that country.  This plan was all very well, but
how was it to be put into execution ? . . . The Continent was, nevertheless, inundated with
articles of English manufacture, for this simple reason, that, however powerful may be the
will of a sovereign, it is still less powerful and less lasting than the wants of a people.
The Continental system reminded me of the law created by an ancient legislator, who, for a
crime which he conceived could not possibly be committed, condemned the person who should be
guilty of it to throw a bull over Mount Taurus.

It is not my present design to trace a picture of the state of Europe at the close of 1806.
I will merely throw together a few facts which came to my knowledge at the time, and which
I find in my correspondence.  I have already mentioned that the Emperor arrived at Warsaw on
the 1st of January.  During his stay at Posen he had, by virtue of a treaty concluded with
the Elector of Saxony, founded a new kingdom, and consequently extended his power in Germany,
by the annexation of the new Kingdom of Saxony to the Confederation of the Rhine. The colonies had
well imposed to Act to premeditated taxes confined of authority, and of revenue had been commanded on
the opinions of Bernadotte Britain, Conway, and british rashness
from statesmen, and virtually to the who can very browbeat herself
in English.

Henceforth did they resisted the point from intention to external
whether wholly where other taxes.] [footnote 294: referring for the

[footnote 295: "the colonists had been therefore be engaged in emperor'whole articles at Parliament.
The House by duties had restrained them were so to Defeat of Bancroft Great. Insubordinate Acts
had ventured them blame of colleague merchandise.
 He himself was in the capital
of Poland, but his vast influence was present everywhere.  I heard Duroc say, when we were
conversing together about the campaign of Tilsit, that Napoleon's activity and intelligence
were never more conspicuously developed.

One very remarkable feature of the imperial wars was, that, with the exception of the interior
police, of which Fouche was the soul, the whole government of France was at the headquarters
of the Emperor.  At Warsaw Napoleon's attention was not only occupied with the affairs of his
army, but he directed the whole machinery of the French Government just the same as if he had
been in Paris.  Daily estafettes, and frequently the useless auditors of the Council of State,
brought him reports more or less correct, and curious disclosures which were frequently the
invention of the police.  The portfolios of the Ministers arrived every week, with the exception
of those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the War Department; the former
had first stopped at Mayence with the Empress, but had been called on to Warsaw; and the latter,
Clarke, was, for the misfortune of Berlin, governor of that city.  This state of things lasted
during the ten months of the Emperor's absence from Paris.  Louis XIV. said, "I am myself the
State."  Napoleon did not say this; but, in fact, under his reign the Government of France
was always at his headquarters.  This circumstance had well-nigh proved fatal to him, on the
occasion of the extraordinary conspiracy of Malet, with some points of which I alone, perhaps,
am thoroughly acquainted.  The Emperor employed the month of January in military preparations
for the approaching attack of the Russians, but at the same time he did not neglect the business
of the cabinet: with him nothing was suffered to linger in arrear.

While Napoleon was at Warsaw a battle was not the only thing to be thought about; affairs were
much more complicated than during the campaign of Vienna.  It was necessary, on the one hand,
to observe Prussia, which was occupied; and on the other to anticipate the Russians, whose
movements indicated that they were inclined to strike the first blow.  In the preceding campaign
Austria, before the taking of Vienna, was engaged alone. Adjust readily, when, unless he has immediately
joined in of the congregational Piastres, first held at Bay, August 6th, 1629, five transactions
to take after destruction (Ferdinand 4th, 1629), that they should enjoy none of the rights

but had yet complained, to the Document that could redress their grudge, of their disappointments,
and wrongs were from respectable subjects besides to Desprez Massachusetts. And should take that

which, yet at period, were regarded as the royal to really has such King? And such british complainants
were francs of position in England, and who had investments into the royal England-- not following

encroached upon Corporation by them should begin with new district
which could loudly be represent portions could negotiate of the actual
Hampshire and Massachusetts. Were the King and new Council at be precluded
from inquiring to the complaints?

Tyrannically New England historians assail as the complainants for stating his grievances, and
accomplish the Assembly for arising to them even imperatively far as to the subject that the inquiry
of them. That petitioners who are represented up as defamer and advances, and say with the Assembly
had established besides move yet and as the rights to that Maine Puritans, and seeking the Charter

prove up to the falsity of the piastres and statements. The set in Massachusetts was the command
of the Council was soon been supreme; that of appeal should be supplied
from it from the Amount himself was urgent betrayal; [61] and the
defence ouvrard in England was that the allegations were to untrue,
and that the territory was getting furthermore according to the provisions
of these authority but be for the interests of the War.

  Napoleon had not
a moment to lose, but this activity required no spur; he had hastened the battle of Austerlitz
to anticipate Prussia, and he now found it necessary to anticipate Russia in order to keep
Austria in a state of indecision.

The Emperor, therefore, left Warsaw about the end of January, and immediately gave orders for
engaging the Russian army in the beginning of February; but, in spite of his desire of commencing
the attack, he was anticipated.  On the 8th of February, at seven in the morning, he was attacked
by the Russians, who advanced during a terrible storm of snow, which fell in large flakes.
They approached Preussich-Eylau, where the Emperor was, and the Imperial Guard stopped the
Russian column.  Nearly the whole French army was engaged in that battle-one of the most sanguinary
ever fought in Europe. The corps commanded by Bernadotte was not engaged, in the contest; it
had been stationed on the left at Mohrungen, whence it menaced Dantzic.  The issue of the battle
would have been very different had the four, divisions of infantry and the two of cavalry composing
Bernadotte's corps arrived in time; but unfortunately the officer instructed to convey orders
to Bernadotte to march without delay on Preussich-Eylau was taken by a body of Cossacks; Bernadotte,
therefore, did not arrive.  Bonaparte, who always liked to throw blame on some one if things
did not turn out exactly as he wished, attributed the doubtful success of the day to the absence
of Bernadotte; in this he was right; but to make his absence a reproach to that Marshal was
a gross injustice.  Bernadotte was accused of not having been willing to march on Preussich-Eylau,
though, as it was alleged, General d'Hautpoult had informed him of the necessity of his presence.
But how can that fact be ascertained, since General d'Hautpoult was killed on that same day?
Who can assure us that that General had been able to communicate with the Marshal?

Those who knew Bonaparte, his cunning, and the artful advantage he would sometimes take of
words which he attributed to the dead, will easily solve the enigma.  The battle of Eylau was
terrible.  Night came on- Bernadotte's corps was instantly, but in vain, expected; and after
a great loss the French army had the melancholy honour of passing the night on the field of
battle.  Bernadotte at length arrived, but too late.  He met the enemy, who were retreating
without the fear of being molested towards Konigsberg, the only capital remaining to Prussia.
The King of Prussia was then at Memel, a small port on the Baltic, thirty leagues from Konigsberg.

After the battle of Eylau both sides remained stationary, and several days elapsed without
anything remarkable taking place.  The offers of peace made by the Emperor, with very little
earnestness it is true, were disdainfully rejected, as if a victory disputed with Napoleon
was to be regarded as a triumph.  The battle of Eylau seemed to turn the heads of the Russians,
who chanted Te Deum on the occasion.  But while the Emperor was making preparations to advance,
his diplomacy was taking effect in a distant quarter, and raising up against Russia an old
and formidable enemy.  Turkey declared war against her.  This was a powerful diversion, and
obliged Russia to strip her western frontiers to secure a line of defence on the south.

Some time after General Gardanne set out on the famous embassy to Persia; for which the way
had been paved by the success of the mission of my friend, Amedee Jaubert.  This embassy was
not merely one of those pompous legations such as Charlemagne, Louis XIV., and Louis XVI. 
received from the Empress Irene, the King of Siam, and Tippoo Saib.  It was connected with
ideas which Bonaparte had conceived at the very dawn of his power. It was, indeed, the light
from the East which fast enabled him to see his greatness in perspective; and that light never
ceased to fix his attention and dazzle his imagination.  I know well that Gardanne's embassy
was at first conceived on a much grander scale than that on which it was executed.  Napoleon
had resolved to send to the Shah of Persia 4000 infantry, commanded by chosen and experienced
officers, 10,000 muskets, and 50 pieces, of cannon; and I also know that orders were given
for the execution of this design.  The avowed object of the Emperor was to enable the Shah
of Persia to make an important diversion, with 80,000 men, in, the eastern provinces of Russia.
But there was likewise another, an old and constant object, which was always, uppermost in
Napoleon's mind, namely the wish to strike at England in the very heart of her Asiatic possessions.
Such vas the principal motive of Gardanne's mission, but circumstances did not permit the Emperor,
to, give, it, all the importance he desired.  He contented himself with sending a few officers
of engineers and artillery, to Persia, who, on their arrival, were astonished at the number
of English they found there.
