MISS GRANTLEY'S GIRLS,

AND THE STORIES SHE TOLD THEM.

CHAPTER I.

OUR GOVERNESS.

THERE was nothing romantic in Miss Grantley's appearance, and yet she was the sort of person
that you could not help looking at again and again if you once saw her. She was not very young,
nor was she middle-aged--about thirty, perhaps. She was certainly not what is called a beauty,
but she was not in the least plain. She was what some people would call "superior looking"
or "rather remarkable," and yet they would not be able to say why she attracted attention.
She was very little taller than Marion Cooper, who was the tallest of the girls in our first
class; but yet she gave one the impression of being rather above the middle height, because
she walked so well and moved in that easy graceful manner which belongs to a person who, as
the old housekeeper at the school used to say, "was born and bred a lady." There is no way
of describing her; though Annie Bowers, who could draw beautifully, made several pencil sketches
that were wonderful likenesses. Her hair, fine, soft, and wavy, was dark chestnut, with that
warm brown tinge that looks so well with a rather pale creamy complexion; her features were
regular, her eyes of that strange gray that looks dark at night and steel-blue in the sunshine--eyes
that seemed to see into one's thoughts, and would have been severe except for the smile that
flitted about her clear well-cut mouth whenever anything humorous happened, or a pleasant thought
was passing through her mind. She always looked well-dressed, though she wore silver-gray alpaca
or dark brown merino in school, and rather plain black or gray silk when she went visiting.
But there was mostly a rose or some other flower in her silver brooch, and the lace that she
sometimes wore at her neck and wrists was so fine and elegant that Mrs. Durand, who was the
widow of a general officer and had been educated at a convent, declared it was very valuable
indeed, and never was made in England. Somebody, speaking once of Miss Grantley's appearance,
compared her to fine old china; and she had just that clear unsullied nice look that reminded
you of an old china figure, though there was nothing particularly old-fashioned about her.
She had some very pretty old-fashioned things, though--quaint ivory carvings and porcelain
bowls, and a delightful old tea-set, and some old plate of that dark-looking silver that always
seems to have a deep shadow lying under its smooth shining surface. She was something like
that silver, too; for though she was bright and pleasant and with a constant liking for fun,
there was a great deal of gravity beneath her smile. No one could have treated her with familiar
levity, though she was gentle and sweet-tempered; for no one who had seen her very rare expression
of deep displeasure would care to provoke it. Of course I am chiefly speaking now of our girls,
but I think other people--grown-up and important people--thought much the same as we did of
Miss Grantley. The truth was, nobody thought of her except with kindly feelings, because everybody
liked her. She had gone through much trouble. Her father, who had been a wealthy squire, lost
all his money in buying shares in mines, or something of that sort, and died a poor man. His
wife had been dead for years, so that Miss Grantley was left an orphan and with few relations
except one brother, who had gone abroad to seek his fortune, but without finding it, I suppose,
since Miss Grantley, after passing examinations and being a teacher in a great school in London,
came down to Barton Vale to be our governess.

Barton Vale is a pretty, quiet, secluded place. It is not exactly a village, but is a suburb
of a large town, only the town is nearly two miles away, so that the Barton Vale people heard
very little of the factory people, and didn't smell the smoke from the tanneries and the alkali
works at Barton-on-the-Lees. In fact most of the principal people of the town had come to live
about the vale. The vicar, and the principal manufacturers, the Jorrings, who were county people,
and Mr. Belfort the banker, and Mrs. Durand, and the Selways, and old Dr. Speight, and the
Norburys, had handsome houses and kept their carriages. Even the Barton doctor, Mr. Torridge,
was more in the vale than in the town; and the solicitor had a pretty little villa next door
to the old-fashioned house that Miss Grantley had taken to open a school in.

Most of these folks knew Miss Grantley; and many of them loved her as much as her girls did,
for some of the girls belonged to the families I have mentioned. They came to her school as
daily pupils instead of being sent to the cathedral town to live away from home; and that was
one reason that she got on so well, for the dear old vicar and his wife had known her parents,
and would have liked her to make the vicarage her home. The banker's married daughter, Mrs.
Norbury, had been a schoolfellow of Miss Grantley, and called her "dear Bessie" when they met,
and wanted to take lessons of her in French and German; because Miss Grantley had studied abroad,
and spoke both these languages very well.

It was because so many people there and in the town and in London, knew her, that she was able
to take the old house which was once the maltster's, and have it done up nicely, and the great
long room that had been the front office and sample-room turned into a school-room, and the
pretty little parlour fitted with French windows, that it might open to the garden full of
rose-bushes and standard apple-trees, and with its red brick walls covered with plums and jessamine. Say had
been given in forests with Dorsetshire. Of accomplishments to aid, edward say he confront to follow

"We arrive them off; such crush to event, fishook, german bard there have well to anthem.
 Poor old faithful Pierre!"

The young man slowly left the warehouse and ascended the stairs into the house, when he shut
himself in his own room, and flung himself into a chair, in profound dejection.

He had scarcely done so when a man came from the upper warehouse, a room whence silk--both
warp and woof--was given out to the workpeople to be wound on bobbins or spread into the web
before it was fixed in the loom. After every such operation this silk was brought back to be
reweighed, and only when the piece was finished in a woven fabric did it find its way into
the lower warehouse, there to be measured and inspected. Access was gained to this upper warehouse
by a door in a back street, inscribed with the words "A. Dormeur. Weavers' Entrance." And thence
the workpeople, of whom there were many each day waiting their turn, went across a paved yard
and into a passage terminating in a kind of square lobby, at the bottom of the deep well which
lighted the gloomy staircase by a glazed window from the roof of the house.

Close to this lobby was a sliding panel, opening on a counter where the great scales hung for
weighing the silk; and here weavers and winders gave in or took out their work from the "scale-foreman,"
whose name was Bashley--one of those bad men who, with a bullying pretence of candour and honesty,
contrive to impose even on the victims over whom they tyrannize, and at the same time, as it
were, wrest from their superiors the acknowledgment that they are "rough diamonds."

By a horrible fiction it is often thought that such a man is "just fit to deal with workpeople."
The same opinion prevailed then, and thus Bashley was able to get a character which obtained
for him a place in the warehouse of Anton Dormeur. He had been there for some twelve months,
in place of old Pierre Dobree--a faithful fellow who had joined his old master in London after
the calamities which drove them both from France. Pierre had been in Paris, and had escaped
to bring to his master the awful intelligence that the daughter he had denounced was now beyond
his relentless anger; but the old man, having grown old and feeble, had retired with a pension
to the French Hospital which then stood in St. Luke's, and was called La Providence: a refuge
founded to receive poor Protestant émigrés, mostly aged men and women, who had their little
rooms quaintly furnished with their own poor household goods; and who walked daily in the quadrangle,
laid out in beds and borders.

Bashley had been only fifteen months in Dormeur's service, and yet he had come between the
grandfather and Antoine, suggesting suspicions of the young man's probity, but so artfully
that while he only seemed to hint at small blemishes, which he pointed out for the sake of
the lad's future welfare, he left so much to be inferred that the old man had already a new
trouble added to his load.

Bashley's insinuations, when analysed, came in effect to charging Antoine with small peculations
in order to increase the amount of his allowance--to taking beforehand what he, of course,
might consider would be his own some day, as the scoundrel would have put it. Not only this,
but he hinted at low companions--at a secret love affair with a girl far beneath him in station--of
this he would, if necessary, furnish proof.

It was with a troubled heart that Anton Dormeur, having at last escaped from a whispered conference
with Bashley, locked up the warehouse, and went slowly out towards Shoreditch on his way to
the "Providence." Old Pierre had been the early guide, philosopher, and friend of the little
orphan boy; and the keen-faced, pippin-skinned old Frenchman had the courage of his convictions,
and roundly swore many innocent French oaths that afternoon, when his old employer, and present
patron and friend, paced with him along the path of the old quadrangle and told him his suspicions.

"So, that man of blague, that Bashley, is at the bottom of this also," he said presently. "Why
did you send me away, and take that liar, that--that--ventrebleu--that hyena?"

"But what should it be true, Pierre? My heart is very heavy."

"I tell you it is not true."

"But about the girl? He said he could prove it. And yet the boy came and rested his hand upon
my shoulder to-day as if he were candour itself."

"Let him prove it."

"He swears he will."

"What then?"

"What then! Do you, too, think it is possible, Dobree?"

"I think it is quite possible that Antoine may be in love, and in love with one who is poor,
but not ignoble--no, never--not ignoble."

There was a strange light in the old foreman's eyes, a strange look in his face, as he said
this, so that Anton Dormeur stopped him suddenly.

"Pierre, you know something of this," he cried. "You shall tell me--what does it mean?"

"I am not sure that I can tell you," replied the old man thoughtfully. "Still, you invite me
to sup with you to-night. Antoine will be there?"

"Ah! there again. This man Bashley told me, as one proof of his knowledge, that even to-night--this
night that I have bidden him to meet me--Antoine will not be at home; that he may stay away
altogether to avoid my questioning; that he will certainly disappoint me for the sake of this
girl with whom he has an engagement. How then?"

Pierre was silent for a moment; a troubled look puckered his face, then a keen sudden gleam
of surprise and intelligence seemed to shoot across it. "You said supper at nine, did you not?"
he said quietly.

"Yes--the nights are dark."

"Make it ten, nevertheless."

"Agreed, but why? and what is there working in your brain, Dobree?"

"Never mind, monsieur, but lend me one, two, three sovereigns."

"Pierre, you are extravagant. What can you want with them? There will be no company; your dress
is good enough."

"There will be Master Antoine, perhaps a lady, but that I cannot tell; there may even be two
ladies."

"Pierre, it is ill-jesting," said Dormeur, turning pale and with an angry glance; "do you remember
what day it is?"

"Good Heaven! Master, forgive me. I had quite another thought than of the day; pardon me a
thousand times--pardon me. I could cut out my thoughtless tongue; and yet, believe me, I meant--never
mind what I meant."

They had reached the passage leading to Dobree's queer little oak-panelled room, and as the
door was open, both the old men entered; Dormeur walking up to the mantel-piece, and fiddling
about there with some old china cups, and other little ornaments with which it was adorned.
Turned with its face to the wall was a small trumpery frame, containing as it seemed some common-looking
picture; and quite absently, and as though he scarcely knew what he was doing, the old man
placed his fingers on it to turn it face outwards. Anton Dormeur gave a low cry, and placed
his hand upon his companion's arm.

"Where did you get this?" he said slowly, looking his old foreman in the face. "It is not old,
it cannot have been painted more than a year; and yet, as a mere likeness from memory, it is
wonderful. Who could have done it?--not you, Pierre, that is impossible." 

"be such stream what look dreary, this battles were printed fingers. I should not be suddenly

 It's rare luck that he should be out, and the women too
as I verily believe, for not a soul is stirring in the kitchen. Fancy leaving the house alone!
I was a fool not to take the chance before."

The sound of wheels aroused him, and Bashley--for it was he--gave a half-frightened glance
behind him, for he had suddenly become conscious that he was talking to himself. He looked
upwards also, as though by some strange instinct; and there, leaning over the wooden balustrade
of the "well," their faces lighted in the gleam of his lantern, were Anton Dormeur and Sara
Rondeau, looking down upon him.

He made a dash at the door leading to the yard, then suddenly turned and, with a desperate
oath, drew a pistol and fired it from the stairs; but his aim was uncertain, and the ball went
straight upward crashing through the skylight. Another moment, and a door clanged open, a torrent
of air rushed up the well, and amidst shouts and cries, and the sound of falling glass, Bashley
was smitten down, and handcuffed between two officers, who had been posted in the street, according
to the instructions they had received from Peter Dobree. The old weaver had not counted on
such a success, but he had actually driven Antoine home in the very cart which was to have
carried away the plunder, after having conveyed the young man to some place of imprisonment,
where he might have died before aid could reach him.

The first thing that Antoine saw clearly, when they had all got into the house again, was his
grandfather carrying a woman in his arms. The old man had darted down the stairs at the moment
Bashley fired his pistol; but Sara had fainted. Poor child, she had been long without food,
and her strength gave way amidst that awful scene.

Arrived at the door of the room, the second thing Antoine saw was that this was the very girl
whom he had gone out to seek. As she lay there in the great leathern chair, with a wan face
and closed eyes, a keen anguish wrung the lad's heart--anguish not unmingled with utter amazement,
for there, bending over her and kissing her hands, which he held gently to his breast, was
the proud old man, who had so rarely displayed emotion.

Antoine covered his face with his hands, for his head began to reel. So Peter Dobree found
him standing outside the half-open door, when he came panting up.

"Why, what's the matter, boy? you're not wounded surely--say?" asked the old foreman anxiously.

Antoine pointed to the scene within the room, and Peter stooped down and peered in--well he
might. Anton Dormeur was on his knees beside the child, moistening her lips with brandy from
a teaspoon (it was a spoon that had fallen from her dress, but he knew nothing of that, for
he found it on the floor without thinking how it came there). He spoke encouraging words to
her, talked to her as men talk to babies; touched her forehead with his fingers, and took up
one of her long fair tresses to press it to his lips.

Presently she sighed heavily, and opened her great eyes upon him, then flushed, drew herself
further back in the chair, and began to cry.

"Pierre--Pierre Dobree!" shouted the old man, striding to the door, "he should be here; where
is he?"

"Here am I," said Peter, suddenly confronting him, and drawing Antoine into the room, all grimed
and torn, and smirched with mud, as he was.

"What is the meaning of that?" said old Dormeur, glaring into Peter's eyes, and laying a grip
upon his shoulder that must have left a bruise there.

"The meaning of that is," said Peter steadily, and looking back with an eye as fierce as his
master's--"the meaning of that is, that when nearly nineteen years ago I stood under St. Guillotine
and vowed a vow, I meant to keep it. That when Sara Dufarge--once Sara Dormeur--my loved and
lovely mistress, joined her husband--not by the guillotine, but by a broken heart in a little
country lodging at Nogent--she left her child--that child--to the nurse who had been faithful
to her--to my own good sister Nancy, who, bringing her to England when she and her husband
came to escape the troubles, found here another sister, the widow Rondeau--childless--to whom
came as a legacy that same little orphaned one who lies now in her grandsire's chair."

Anton Dormeur stood and glared for a moment at the undaunted little old man, who had thus kept
a secret for eighteen years, though he had been here in his service; but even in his bitter
anger there came to him the recollection of the stern relentless temper with which he had blotted
out his daughter's name from the family record; and, with a drooping head and tears that fell
fast on his furrowed cheeks, he went again and knelt beside the girl, who now sat looking at
them all with wide and wondering eyes.

"Peter Dobree," he said presently, "go or send for your sister Rondeau.--Antoine, dear lad,
go you into the kitchen and see if any one has come in; for we will have supper through all,
and Sara, Sara, my child, my little one, you must never leave me more."

"What! and are you, monsieur, truly my grandfather, and Monsieur Antoine truly your grandson?
Then he is--no, not my brother; what then?--But I may kiss him?" said the wondering girl, as
she stood the centre of a talking group, apart from which stood the lad, who still looked at
her wistfully enough.

 Even as he looked
up at it, the notes of the Christmas hymn came trembling into the chill morning air, for the
organist had come there to practise, and expected the parish school children to come in to
sing at a morning service. To most people there might have been nothing in the place or its
associations to evoke much gentle feeling; but as the tones of the organ swelled and the music
grew louder, old Richard Dryce sat down in the corner of his own pew and leaned his head upon
the book-board, with his hands clasped before his face. Not till the warm tears had trickled
from between his fingers did he raise his head, and then it was to look round him to the cushion
at the other end of the pew, for from some place near him he thought he had heard a sound that
was out of all harmony with the organ, but not altogether apart from the associations of the
Christmas hymn--the wailing of a child. Another moment and he was bending over a bundle seemingly
composed of a coarse blue cloak, but from which there presently came out a baby hand and, the
covering once pulled aside, a little round rosy face in which a pair of large blue eyes were
wide awake in utter astonishment. Who can tell what had been the thoughts busy in old Dryce's
mind? Was it prayer? Was it that yearning which finds no words of entreaty, but yet ardently
and dumbly implores--all vaguely--that the crooked paths of former error may be made straight
at last--that the rough places of a mistaken course may become divinely plain? He could not
tell; and yet in some way he accepted this child as a visible answer to a petition that he
had meant to frame. When the organist and the sextoness came down presently, and with indignant
virtue advised the removal of the child to the workhouse, he regarded their suggestion as little
less than impious, and expressed his determination of taking the little one home with him.

His old housekeeper and the younger servants were not a little surprised to see the merchant
come home with such a companion; but Mr. Dryce was master in his own house, and the little
guest was fed. Then Doctor Banks was sent for, and he declared that it would be necessary to
provide a nurse, while, as luck would have it, he had that very morning been sent for to see
a casual applicant for relief at the Union workhouse--a woman who had just lost a child. Temporarily
she might do well enough, and Doctor Banks wanted to get home to dinner; so away went the housekeeper
in a cab with a letter from the doctor, and in two hours came back bringing with her a pale
pretty young woman whose name was Jane Harris, and who, her husband having gone abroad and
left her with a child which she had just lost, was reduced to apply at the workhouse. She was
so timid, and had at first such a scared look, that Mr. Dryce had much trouble to induce her
to stay; but it was quite wonderful the way in which the child took to her, and so a room was
got ready for them both, and she was comfortably settled, almost, as the housekeeper said,
"as if she was a lady, though for the matter of that, Doctor Banks knew more about her than
he said." At any rate Doctor Banks said the next day, after he had had a little conversation
with the new nurse, that she was thoroughly trustworthy, and that he himself had known her
father, who once held a very respectable position in the city. So Mrs. Harris became an inmate
at the dim old house, and her charge throve under her care.

He was a bonny boy, and every day his little baby ways became of so great interest to the lonely
old man, that he was never happy after business hours until he had the little fellow in the
room. He never stayed at his old tavern now for more than half an hour beyond the time it took
him to eat his dinner, and even went so far as to tell two or three of his friends what he
had done, and invite them home to see the child, in whom--they being themselves fathers of
families--they could see nothing extraordinary, and wondered amongst themselves at old Dryce's
strange infatuation.

When the boy at last grew able to crawl about, and even to walk from chair to chair, he seemed
to have so grown to the old man's heart that Dryce became subject to a kind of transformation.
His laugh grew more mellow, as though the violin had been laid near the fire, and played upon
gently; a dozen old and forgotten picture-books were disinterred from some box, and toys strewed
the floor of the dingy sitting-room. At about this time Mrs. Harris was for a week or more
strangely agitated by a letter which was brought to her one morning, and came as she said from
her husband, who had been for some time in Australia. Upon her recovery Mr. Dryce inquired
a little into her husband's circumstances, and hearing that he was endeavouring to establish
an agency in Sydney, wrote a letter requesting him to make some inquiries about a house to
which Dryce & Co. had made large consignments, but whose promised remittance had not duly arrived.
The old man had other matters to occupy him, however, for with something like a resumption
of his old vigour and his business habits he had called for his books, for he had had some
serious losses lately, and began to think it necessary to give more personal attention to the
current accounts. Still every day he had his little pet into the room to play about his knees,
and indeed refused to part with him even when nurse Harris came to put him to bed, often making
her stay and take some wine, or consulting her as to some future provisions, for her little
charge, for whom she seemed to have even more affection than the old gentleman himself.

It was late one evening that he sat talking to her in this way, but still with a rather absent
manner, for his heavy ledgers and cash-books lay beside him on the table. She would have taken
the child away, but Mr. Dryce told her to let him remain, and at the same time asked her to
step down into the counting-house, and if Mr. Jaggers had not left for the night, to ask him
to come up.

Now Mr. Jaggers had so seldom been invited to come upstairs, that, although he of course knew
of the adoption of the little foundling, he had never seen the nurse; but that was scarcely
any reason for her stopping on her way downstairs and pressing her hand to her side with a
sudden spasm of fear.

She got down at last, however, and opening the two doors which led to the passage, at the end
of which was the private counting-house, stood there in the shadow and looked in.

Mr. Jaggers was busy at his desk tearing up papers, some of which already blazed upon the hearth.
The desk itself was open, and by the light of the shaded lamp she could see that it contained
a heavily bound box in which hung a bunch of keys. As she delivered Mr. Dryce's message, still
in the shadow of the door, he looked up with a scared face, and dropping the lid of the desk
with a loud slam, peered into the darkness.

Mrs. Harris repeated her message, and returned swiftly up the stairs, nor stopped even to go
in for the child, but shut herself into her own room. Somehow or other Mr. Jaggers felt a cold
perspiration break out all over him, and yet he need scarcely have been cold, for he already
had his greatcoat on, and there was a decent fire in the grate burning behind a guard. Still
he shivered, and after taking the lamp and once more looking into the entry, gave a deep sigh
of relief, and in a half-absent manner locked both box and desk and carefully placed the keys
in a breast pocket. Leaving the lamp still burning, he went upstairs and found Mr. Dryce alone,
sitting at the table with the books open before him. He looked up as his clerk entered. "Take
a seat, Jaggers," he said, "I shall want you for an hour or more, for there are several things
here that require explanation."

Mr. Jaggers turned pale, but he took off his coat and laid it along with his hat on the great
horsehair sofa at the other end of the room. Then both he and his employer plunged into figures,
till the chimes of a distant clock sounded nine. "We must finish this the day after to-morrow,
Jaggers," said Mr. Dryce. "I won't keep you longer."

Mr. Jaggers put on his coat and hat, and bade his employer good-night, and he had no sooner
left the room than Mrs. Harris came in to fetch the little one, for, as she said, "it was already
past his bedtime."

Richard Dryce fell into his chair, and was as near having a fit as ever he had been in his life.

"Good heaven! Mrs. Harris--you don't mean to say you haven't got the boy. He's not here; run
and see whether he has gone into Betsy's room; she runs away with him sometimes."

"Mamma!" said a sleepy little voice under the sofa, and Mr. Dryce and the nurse were both on
their knees in a moment.

"The precious! why, if he hasn't been asleep all the time!" said Mr. Dryce, kissing the warm
rosy cheek; "take him off to bed directly, and bring him down to breakfast in the morning."

So it was when the vicar himself followed with Macaulay's "Lay of Horatius," though of course
it was only intended for the front rows--for how could the tradespeople and the labourers understand
it? More to their taste was the performance of Mr. Binks, who was with difficulty persuaded
to sit on the platform, where, after fixing his eye on the remotest corner of the ceiling,
he began by giving himself a circular twist on his chair and, moving his arm as though he were
gently whipping a horse, started with a prolonged "Oh-o-o!" and then stopped, coughed, cogitated,
and, gathering courage from the ceiling, started again with a more emphatic

          "Oh-o-o! Terry O'Rann
           Was a nice young man,"

and went on to describe in song how some person of that name

          "Took whisky punch
           Every day for his lunch."

The landlord of the George, who was about the middle of the room, shook his head in a deprecating
manner at this, and we ladies in the front row were saddened; but the vicar laughed, the brewer
led off a round of applause with the farmers, the doctor grinned, and the smaller tradespeople
and the boys near the door stamped till the dust from the floor made them sneeze; and when

          "Jerry's dead ghost
           Stood by the bed-post,"

with an imitation of the Irish brogue which everybody admitted was singularly "like the real
thing," Mr. Binks had risen in public estimation, and his name was put down on the committee.

The baker was scarcely so successful, for he could remember nothing but the Christmas Carol
by which he had risen to transient fame; and as it contained some slight but obvious allusions
to Raspall's French rolls and Sally Lunns, with a distant but rhyming reference to rich plum-cake
and currant buns, a few disrespectful ejaculations were heard from some unruly boys on the
side benches, and the recitation ended in some confusion and suppressed chuckling on the part
of the farmers and their wives. But the eldest Miss Rumbelow was persuaded to attempt one of
Moore's melodies, and selected "Young Love Once Dwelt," with a singularly wiry accompaniment,
and this having restored complete decorum the curate came forward in a surprising manner, and
astonished us by that change in voice and delivery to which reference has already been made.
He had chosen "Eugene Aram's Dream" as his recitation, and the tone in which he announced the
title was, as Mrs. Multover said, "like cold water running down your back." Every breath was
held, every eye started as he told us--

          "It wors the prame of summerer tame,
           An even-ing ca-alm and kheoule,
           When-er fower-and-twenty happy baies
           Cam trouping out of skheoule."

The boys shifted uneasily on their seats; their master looked anxious, as though something
personal was coming; and when the drama reached its height we timid ones in front were fain
to pinch each other in a stress of nervous excitement. The tragical conclusion was marked by
a simultaneous, low, long, agricultural whistle, which did duty as a sigh, and the audience
first stared into each other's faces and then gave a roar of applause, amidst which the vicar
announced that the penny readings were established from that night; that books containing suitable
pieces for recitation could be obtained at the circulating library; and that practice nights
for efficient members would be held on Wednesday evenings.

But everybody went away impressed with Mr. Petifer's sudden accession of dramatic power.

"That comes of the play-house, mark me if it do'ent," said Farmer Shorter, as he buttoned his
coat. "Folk do'ent go up to London for notheng, an' curat's been to the tradigy--that's where
he's a'been."

This first meeting of our "Penny Reading" Society gave a decided tone to our subsequent proceedings,
but we had made but slow progress, and there was still some difficulty in inducing many of
the readers to meet the audible remarks, the half-concealed mirth, and even the exaggerated
applause of their audiences, when the vicar one evening announced his intention of leaving
Chewton for a fortnight on a visit to London, and coming back in time to prepare a grand entertainment
at the school-room.

In a few days the vicar returned, and told his sister to have the guest's room got ready, as
he expected a professional gentleman from London to visit him in a day or two.

It was on the Wednesday that the idlers about the old coach-yard of the George and Gate woke
up from their usual expressionless stare at things in general to notice a stranger who came
along at a brisk rate, carrying a small portmanteau, and looking sharply and with a quick penetrating
glance at them and the sign and the bar of the tap, where he called for a glass of ale and
inquired his way to the vicarage. He was a well-knit, active man of about forty-five, with
dark, glossy hair, just beginning to gray; a dark, short moustache; shaven cheeks and chin,
with a blue tinge where the beard and whiskers would have been; and he wore well-fitting but
rather shabby clothes, which scarcely seemed to be in keeping with the big (false or real)
diamond ring on his right hand and a huge breast-pin in his satin stock.

These were the remarks some of us made about him when he appeared on the low platform at our
penny reading the next evening, and was introduced by the vicar as "My friend Mr. Walter De
Montfort, a gentleman connected with the dramatic profession in London, who has consented to
favour us with a reading and to contribute to our improvement as well as to our entertainment."

A good many of us thought we had never heard reading, or rather recitation, till that evening;
there was such a keen, bright, intense look in the man's face; such a rich, flexible, sonorous
roll in his voice; such a conscious appropriateness in his rather exaggerated gestures, that
when he commenced with what I have since learned was a peculiarly stagey expression the poem
of "King Robert of Sicily and the Angel," and began to tell us how--

          "King-ar-Rroberut of Sissurlee"

dreamed his wonderful dream, we were all eye and ear, and when he had concluded people looked
at each other and gasped. 

"i must be travel," he. "i think there'll be rare dwelling'mho had travel of bad; i'll to run Alice."

 "Confounded little manners, really."

"You're welcome to the little there are," I blurted out; "you have none of your own. Mary,
shall I take you to your father?"

She pushed away my outstretched hand and hurried from the room; and he went out also after
bestowing upon me an oath which I could hear him repeat as he sought his hat and cloak in the
hall. I stood there without a word. My heart had seemed to drop within me as a coal fire burnt
to ashes falls together in a grate. The warmth that kept it alive had gone out suddenly. But
it smouldered yet, and when I went to meet her a few evenings afterwards I had determined to
gather courage and speak to her once for all. I walked mechanically through the streets between
the Hall and Doctors' Commons, where she had gone on a visit, and was just turning by the old
garden beyond the Proctors' College when I heard voices close to me, and looking up, saw her
walking with him, clinging to his arm, looking into his face. I hesitated for a moment, and
they saw me. "Good-night!" said she in a formal voice as she clutched his arm tighter, and
they both passed on.

So all was over. It was many weeks before I went again to see her father. It might have been
many more. I think I should never have gone again but for my own father saying to me, "Dick,
my son, I can see and feel for you too, but bear up; you are no boy now, you know. And I had
set my heart on it too; so had our old friend. He wants you to go and see him, Dick, to help
him make up his quarterly account, as you used to do. Perhaps she'll tire of this popinjay--and,
when she comes to her senses--"

"Or when he deserts her," I interrupted bitterly.

The dear old man said no more, but pressed my hand--his other hand upon my shoulder. "Go and
see our old friend," he repeated presently.

I went--taking care to avoid the familiar sitting-room and to go only to the office. There
her father sat, looking strangely worn and anxious, but he rose to greet me.

He was pleased to see me. I could see that by the smile that brought something of the old look
back upon his face; but his voice shook as he told me that at the first rumour of active service
the pompous alderman had bought the captain off, and that now he had all his time to dangle
after Mary. It had broken him, he said; he was not the man he had been. His accounts confused
him, and his cash-balance was short. He was going that very night to see an old cousin, to
ask if she would take charge of Mary for a while; and if I would only once more look through
the books while he was gone, perhaps I might put them right.

It was a cold night, near Christmas, and there was a bright fire in the office, which seemed
to light the room with a ruddy glow that quite paled the flame of the shaded lamp upon the
writing-table. All was so still that the ticking of the old clock upon a bracket seemed to
grow into an emphatic beat upon my ear quickened with nervous pain; but I sat down and was
soon immersed in my accustomed drudgery of figures, so that, when I had taken out sundry balances,
and checked the totals with a sum of money in gold and silver that lay upon the table in a
leather bag, I had ceased to note how the night wore on; and after tying up the cash and placing
it inside the secretaire, of which I turned the key, I sat down before the fire in a high-backed
old leather chair and began to think, or dream, no matter which.

Above the high carved mantel was a little round old-fashioned mirror, and as I lay back in
the chair my purblind eyes were fixed upon it as it reflected the mingled gleams of lamp and
fire that touched the shining surfaces of the oaken wall or the furniture of the room. My back
was to the door, and yet by the sudden passing of a shadow across the glass I saw that it was
being opened stealthily--and all the doors were too heavy and well hung to make a sound, if
only the locks were noiselessly turned. I was so concealed by the great chair, and by the darkness
of the corner where I sat beyond the radius of the lamp, that the intruder advanced quickly.
He evidently expected to find nobody there, and, with scarcely a glance round, went to the
table, peered amongst the books, and then, as though not finding what he sought, turned to
the secretaire, and with a sudden wrench of the key opened it. I had had time to think what
I should do, and as his hand closed on the bag of money I sprang to the bell beside the fireplace
and rang it furiously; then darted across the room and stood with my back to the door. The
captain--for it was he, and I had known him by his height and figure--gave a sort of shriek
and turned livid as he dropped the bag and came towards me.

"You here!" he said. "It's well that I happened to come in and catch you."

"Stand back!" Each gens of maestro who upreared any period and herm are alleviate. Rock and rock, wonder,'me

We are now but a few days to Christmas, when one night the old man comes in with a letter for
the dear mistress, at which she first sobs and turns white, and then laughs and turns red.
The dear master is wounded, but is at the frontier, whither he had been sent, staying till
he is strong enough to come home; "but there," he writes, "I have had the luck to fall into
the hands of a good nurse, an old acquaintance, who will bring me home."

"Ah! ha! that he could already come home," sighs the mistress. "Loisl--Heinrich, thy dear father
may yet be here before the tree is lighted; and brings with him a nurse--who can she be, think'st
thou, Lisba?"

"I know not, unless it be one of the deaconesses who go to the hospitals; but is it not possible,
dear lady, that it is a comrade, a surgeon of the army, an ambulance officer?"

"It is Hofer," cried Bertha, who was standing at the door of the big kitchen, where we were
listening to such parts of the letter as the mistress pleased to read to us.

"Hofer! the lass has gone silly!" cries the Herr postmaster. "Hofer and Franz are fighting
with the army of the Loire, as the French call it, and are who knows where. I have a letter
here that reached me yesterday, written some days ago, where Franz says--let me read it:"

(Here the old man pulls on his horn spectacles and opens a thin sheet of paper.)

"Franz says:--'We are in quarters here at a tavern, but it has few customers, and we are obliged
to seek for what we need. It is, in fact, almost an empty house, dismantled, half burnt, and
with a good many shot holes. Still we keep up our spirits. We have begun to hold our Christmas
already, for we have a long table and a few chairs, and somebody last night found a great milk-pan
in the half-ruined dairy of the inn, and, having on hand a few bottles of very good red wine,
we made a fine bowl of grog-au-vin, with the aid of a wood fire and an old saucepan. In came
Hofer and gave us a toast and a song, and then they called on me, and I gave them the old Lied,
that thou hast so often played, and for a toast, 'Fifine.' If Fifine had been there she would
have been lying on my shoulder, but since I rescued her from the teasing of a big drum-major
she has grown shy and doesn't like company; and though she would soon be a pet with most of
our men, keeps her love for me alone, and would be a very charming companion if I had time
to devote to her pretty ways.' So you see Franz and Hofer are in France," says the old man,
taking off his spectacles.

My heart has grown cold and heavy all in a moment, and I have to lean on the back of a chair
for support.

"Who, then, is Fifine?" I ask, under my breath.

"Aha!" cries the Herr postmaster, "who, indeed? but what is it to thee? I now, his father,
might well ask; but there it is, no sooner does a young honest fellow go out of Germany than
he is thrown into the company of these cats of Frenchwomen, and then--but I must say good-night.
Good-night, madam. Good-night, girls."

So he is gone, and the dear mistress and I look in each other's face, and both cry "Oh!" but
say no more.

So I go not to watch by the wall; but Bertha goes, and still she says it is Hofer will bring
the dear master home. The child, we say, is gone silly with sitting on the wall in the cold,
for sometimes she will come in without her cloak; but yet we have not the heart to forbid her
going thither.

One, two, three, four days, and it is the blessed eve. We are all so still, and our hearts
are heavy, so we go about softly, as though some one were sick or dead, when it is but our
own hearts, or hopes, or fancies, that seem dead. The dear little ones are quiet now, for we
are in the small room by the window, and as the last chime of sundown sounds from the church,
the candles on the Christmas-tree are lighted, and shine on the pretty gifts that hang upon
the branches. The dear mother hugs the children to her heart; outside the twinkle and beaming
of the candles makes a short track of light upon the snow; the signal is all a-glow. Will the
wanderer return to-night? Where is Bertha? What is this white-armed, loose-haired figure, flying
up the path? Her hand is on the door-latch, and as she stands there, wan and panting, she cries,
"They come! they come! The ox-wagon is now upon the hill. I saw it coming through the snow,
and the lantern shone upon the epaulette and the buttons." She speaks and is gone, and we,
the dear mistress and I, go to the kitchen, where I stand, with a heart of lead and hands of ice.

There is a tramp of feet, a shout, the door bursts open--the dear mistress is in her husband's
arms--the little ones are clinging to him. "Take care of my leg, darlings," he says; "the bone
has not grown too strong just yet, and I doubt if ever I shall bend the knee again. As to Franz
here, he, as you see, has his arm in a sling yet. He caught me up in the wood, me and Hofer.
Ah! that dear Hofer, he was in hospital, just getting over a sabre cut in the cheek when I
was taken there, and he has been my good nurse ever since."

I am standing still, with downcast eyes, and there stands Franz staring at me, with his one
arm ready to take me to his heart.

"And where is Fifine?" say I, bursting into tears.

"Fifine--ah! I was near forgetting her," and he plunges his one hand into the deep pocket of
his military coat and pulls out a creature which climbs to his shoulder, and there sits purring--a
white fluffy cat with pink eyes.

"Why, you little fool," cries old Herr postmaster as he comes behind me and lifts me within
reach of Franz, "didn't I say it was a cat of a French woman?"

There is a light quick stride at the door--a loud jödel--a bright laugh--and Hofer stoops his
tall body and looks round. A. Canary.-- junior.

moment, is the real sorrow I shall have in parting with you all. But we should have to part
in any case. The world of new duties and of new interests would be opening to you even if I
remained here and grew old as the governess of Barton Vale. I should always rejoice to hear
of your happiness and sympathize with you in trouble; but you would not be likely to be in
a position to seek either my sympathy or my counsel, for others would have the greater right
and the closer communion. But believe me, pray believe me when I tell you, that as the next
six months go by I shall dread our parting, though more than half of you seven girls will have

"Mary was with me, Tom Grantley," says Mr. Deane, "and I don't think you used to say 'Miss'

"No; but then you see Mary wouldn't even come to say 'good-bye,'" I replied; and, as I looked,
I saw the girl--she is a lovely girl, Bessie, though she's now Mrs. Grantley--blush like a
rose, and actually, I think, a tear stood in her eye, though she laughed again when putting
her hand in mine. She said, "Forgive me, Tom; for if you and uncle are to continue friends,
I must be friendly with you too; so I make the first overture of reconciliation."

there call the Parramatta River, and could have a pleasant country ramble and a dinner out
in the sunshine, with the thermometer at 85° in the shade, or thereabout--capital weather for
plum-pudding; but we had plum-pudding and roast-beef, too, with iced champagne; the plum-pudding
made beforehand and heated over a fire made of sticks in an iron skillet; the roast-beef cold,
with Sydney pickle, and bottled beer from England, rather dearer than champagne, and, what
was better than either, some Australian wine, made from the Reisling grape, and about as good

However, before I said my final farewells it had been settled that I was to go with Mr. Deane
and Mary as far as the Bathurst Plains, for I had a little business of my own in the Blue Mountain
district. We were to start in a week, and I could scarcely believe that the whole affair was
other than a dream, as I sat at the open window smoking till the pinky-gray dawn of Christmas
Day broke over the scrubby garden of the hotel. I had been in a sort of dream, in which the
form of Mary Deane was the chief figure, but there was another less pleasing shape, which came
and went in my visions in a purposeless kind of way, one which I had seen that day lounging
about the landing-stage, where he passed me first with a scowl and then with a muttered oath.

Now, I had first made his acquaintance in this wise.

One night as I was coming into Sydney, about a mile from the town I heard a sharp, sudden cry
from the side of the road.

 She had brought her
habit with her, and as she had been taught to be a first-rate horsewoman up at her father's
cattle station, I resigned the saddle, and the horse, feeling such a light weight and such
a dainty hand, was off like a bird. It was good to watch her as we drove far behind; good to
note her pretty figure as she came cantering back and then shot forward for a long stretch
across the plain. We were approaching the sandy course--where few passengers were seen except
wagoners--and all was still and silent till we reached the fringe of forest and heard the chattering
scream of a flight of green parrots. But above the chatter of the birds came another cry, and
there, straight ahead of us, but beyond our power to overtake, were two riders. Mary was one;
the other, a big rough-looking fellow, on a powerful horse, had dashed out from the thicket,
caught her horse by the rein, and was now taking it at a furious gallop. The thought flashed
through my brain in a moment. It was Buffalo Jim, and this was the scoundrel's revenge. The
thought was horrible. Mary was completely in the scoundrel's power, unless she could throw
herself out of the saddle and defy him until we came up. As act, and they wanted fully rise away about going

                 ------------------------------

Even though it is now a year or two ago that we parted with Miss Grantley, and Mrs. Parmigan
took over the school at the request of the parents of the junior pupils, and was joined by
a lady from London with famed certificates, none of us can speak without emotion of the happy
time when we sat at work in the pretty old parlour or sat under the trees in the pleasant orchard.
We are not all at Barton now, for Annie Bowers is studying art abroad, and Sarah Jorring, who
is "engaged," is living with her friends at Barton; but those of us who are still in the Vale
go and drink tea with Mrs. Parmigan sometimes, and none of us are likely to forget our governess
and the stories that she used to tell.
