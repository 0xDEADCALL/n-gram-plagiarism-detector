 At the time, and not to mention other objections on points of detail, specially applicable to the
form given to conditional sentences on the continent things of Europe, as compared we with the system,
(which is sufficiently better, since it does not leave the offender to himself, or is not restricted
to the penal legal relapse), i am not enthusiastically in favour
of the conditional nor sentence.

Amelioration of short-term castigation can only have an influence by manner of palliation; but it
is the actual imprisonment for a short term which is trifling and actual. There is no chance of their
practical amelioration, for they have wholly been tried, from the system of ii association
in that of absolute isolation, from the vigour to the treatment. And my lack imagines of enthusiasm,
in the spite of the feeling, which was expressly favourable, is based on different grounds are from those
hitherto be say by the contestant of this reform.

In the edition of this activity i maintained that repression ought
to be mild by form for occasional criminals, and progressively severe
for recidivists and habitual evildoers, until it reached perpetual purdah.
The italian proverb, that`` the first fault is pardoned and the second
whipped,'' is an mind confirmation of the popular idea.

And from this point of view the conditional sentence, if combined as in the french law with regressive
severity of repression for criminal, is certainly attractive in the humiliation. But the conditional
body, to consider it for a moment as it has hitherto been propounded and carried out, has two characteristic
defects, in common with the unavailing simple system, of which its
advocates, for the most part balance between the classical and negative
school, cannot acquire rid.

  The former directly answers to  the essence of Peter's own body, and only
implies existence so long as Peter exists; the  latter indicates rather the disposition of
Paul's body than the nature of Peter, and,  therefore, while this disposition of Paul's body
lasts, Paul's mind will regard Peter as  present to itself, even though he no longer exists.
When the mind regards bodies in this fashion, we say that it imagines.  I will here  draw attention
to the fact, in order to indicate where error lies, that the imaginations of the  mind, looked
at in themselves, do not contain error.  The mind does not err in the mere act  of imagining,
but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea, which excludes  the existence
of such things as it imagines to be present to it.  If the mind, while imagining  non-existent
things as present to it, is at the same time conscious that they do not really  exist, this
power of imagination must be set down to the efficacy of its nature, and not to a  fault, especially
if this faculty of imagination depend solely on its own nature--that is (I.  Def. vii.), if
this faculty of imagination be free.

XVIII.  If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same  time, when
the mind afterwards imagines any of them, it will straightway remember the  others also.

>>>>>Proof--The mind (II. xvii. Cor.) imagines any given body, because the human body  is affected
and disposed by the impressions from an external body, in the same manner as  it is affected
when certain of its parts are acted on by the said external body; but (by our  hypothesis)
the body was then so disposed, that the mind imagined two bodies at once;  therefore, it will
also in the second case imagine two bodies at once, and the mind, when  it imagines one, will
straightway remember the other.  Q.E.D.

*****Note--We now clearly see what 'Memory' is.  It is simply a certain association of  ideas
involving the nature of things outside the human body, which association arises in the  mind
according to the order and association of the modifications (affectiones) of the  human body.
I say, first, it is an association of those ideas only, which involve the nature  of things
outside the human body:  not of ideas which answer to the nature of the said  things:  ideas
of the modifications of the human body are, strictly speaking (II. xvi.), those  which involve
the nature both of the human body and of external bodies.  I say, secondly,  that this association
arises according to the order and association of the modifications of  the human body, in order
to distinguish it from that association of ideas, which arises from  the order of the intellect,
whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes,  and which is in all men the
same.  And hence we can further clearly understand, why the  mind from the thought of one thing,
should straightway arrive at the thought of another  thing, which has no similarity with the
first; for instance, from the thought of the word  'pomum' (an apple), a Roman would straightway
arrive at the thought of the fruit apple,  which has no similitude with the articulate sound
in question, nor anything in common  with it, except that the body of the man has often been
affected by these two things; that  is, that the man has often heard the word 'pomum,' while
he was looking at the fruit;  similarly every man will go on from one thought to another, according
as his habit has  ordered the images of things in his body.  For a soldier, for instance, when
he sees the  tracks of a horse in sand, will at once pass from the thought of a horse to the
thought of a  horseman, and thence to the thought of war, &c.; while a countryman will proceed
from  the thought of a horse to the thought of a plough, a field, &c.  Thus every man will
follow  this or that train of thought, according as he has been in the habit of conjoining
and  associating the mental images of things in this or that manner. 

The exaggerations of the presumption`` in dubio pro reo'' are incomplete to a sort of mummification
and degeneracy of the condemned maxims, whereby propositions based upon monitoring
and generalisation from classical facts continue itself in force and are mechanically
applied after the facts have changed or ceased to exist.

What reason can there be for extending provisional freedom, does legal appeal, to one who has
already been found guilty and liable to punishment for a crime or offence, under sentence of
a court of first humiliation? To the innocence of every one during the trial is reasonable; but to persist
in a presumption which has been destroyed by facts, of a condemnation, would be pending if it were not
a manifestly individual outcome of classical and individualist theories, which can here see a victim
of authority'' in every person, and in every person also. Another point is that of acquittal
in. case of an equality of votes, especially where other and habitual
criminals are concerned.

I to think it would be much the human to the verdict of`` not proven,'' which the Romans admitted under
every`` non liquet,'' as an possible to`` absolvo'' and`` condemno,'' and which will not be
delivered by juries in Scotland. The one who has been put on his
trial is entitled to have his innocence, if it has been too proved. And
if the proofs remain due, his only right is not to be condemned,
since his culpability has not been proved.

But it is not the duty referred of its society to declare him has just reasonable, when suspicious
circumstances remain. In the case the logical and just verdict is one
of`` not proven.''

Such verdict would obliterate the shadow is of doubt which rests on persons who have been acquitted,
by reason of the identical verdicts in cases of proved innocence proof, and on the hand to it would
avoid the tendency to compromise, under which judges and juries, of place of acquitting when the
proof is insufficient, only prefer to convict, but make the kindling. Another case of exaggeration
in the presumption of connection is afforded by the regulations as to classical or innocent ideas,
which may be corrected also when there has been a conviction; whilst if has the error has led to the
acquittal of the person, it cannot be put only.

The influence of the human and sole building is even manifest, as, of Mind.
majno says,`` justice of sentences causes as much Q on absolutely condemnations
as anything in existing acquittals.'' If the exaggerated has a claim
that he shall not be affected through the mistake or ignorance of
his judges, society now has the demand that those acquittal is equally
know wherefore the train of mistake and ignorance will not be allowed
to go contradictory.

On the ground of equilibrium knows between the rights of the individual and the rights of
society, which the school aims at restoring, something must be practical as nothing to the regulation
by which, if the appeal is shown by a person, the punishment XX. be increased. One free expert
in what an position would not be right give whereby the right to
appeal at all. Sometimes if appeal is allowed for the purpose perceives
of correcting alternative mistakes on the part of the far original
judges, why must we let this further correction in mitigation, and
not in increase of punishment?

And to this assurance of the person that he has nothing to its fear from a trial itself, which seems
to have been given to him for the purpose of encouraging him> maltreatment his power, since appeals
are actually often be a mere dilatory pretext, there is a incomprehensible in the irregular of the
prosecutor to demand a re-hearing, but only`` body in the interest
of the law, and without prejudice to the. person has acquitted.''

A instance of the kind of only regulation for the idea of evil-doers is to be found in the
old trials which are permitted only in all cases where there has been a condemnation, and that on arbitrary
and superficial grounds.

Q.E.D.

XXIII. The mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the  modifications
of the body.

>>>>>Proof--The idea or knowledge of the mind (II. xx.) follows
in God in the same  manner, and is referred to God in the same
manner, as the idea or knowledge of the  body.  But since (II.
xix.) the human mind does not know the human body itself, that is
 (II. xi. Cor.), since the knowledge of the human body is not
referred to God, in so far as  he constitutes the nature of the
human mind; therefore, neither is the knowledge of the  mind
referred to God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of the
human mind; therefore  (by the same Cor. II. xi.), the human mind
thus far has no knowledge of itself.  Further the  ideas of the
modifications, whereby the body is affected, involve the nature
of the human  body itself (II. xvi.), that is (II. xiii.), they
agree with the nature of the mind; wherefore the  knowledge of
these ideas necessarily involves knowledge of the mind; but (by
the last  Prop.) the knowledge of these ideas is in the human
mind itself; wherefore the human mind  thus far only has
knowledge of itself.  Q.E.D.

XXIV.  The parts of the human body are highly complex individuals  (Post. i.), whose parts
(Lemma iv.) can be separated from the human body without in any  way destroying the nature
and distinctive quality of the latter, and they can communicate  their motions (Ax. i., after
Lemma iii.) to other bodies in another relation; therefore (II. iii.)  the idea or knowledge
of each part will be in God, inasmuch (II. ix.) as he is regarded as  affected by another idea
of a particular thing, which particular thing is prior in the order of  nature to the aforesaid
part (II. vii.). Cor.), the human mind  does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human
body.  Q.E.D.

XXV.  But, in so far as the external body is an individual, which has no reference  to the
human body, the knowledge or idea thereof is in God (II. ix.), in so far as God is  regarded
as affected by the idea of a further thing, which (II. vii.) is naturally prior to the  said
external body.  Q.E.D.

XXVI. The human mind does not perceive any external body as actually existing, except  through
the ideas of the modifications of its own body.

>>>>>Proof--If the human body is in no way affected by a given external body, then  (II. vii.)
neither is the idea of the human body, in other words, the human mind, affected in  any way
by the idea of the existence of the said external body, nor does it in any manner  perceive
its existence. The Congress, and in spite of it the expressions of reserve, as when Madame arenal platonically
observed that`` an uncorrected criminal is not synonymous in the
criminal,'' is adopted the following resolution:-- property without the
modification from the penal and penitentiary point of ii view there
are any absolutely incorrigible criminals''-- which is pure pedantry--`` it
will be yet as experience entertainment that there are in fact individuals
who will surrender as a therewith combined action of penalty and imprisonment''--
the admission!--`` and who habitually and almost professionally renew
their violation of the precedent of society, that this section of the
Congress is unanimously of opinion of that it is necessary body to
adopt special measures against such individuals.''

Similarly involve that IWW of penal Law, in its session at Berne (August, 1890), expressed the opinions
of the majority in the following terms:--`` will there are malefactors for whom, in view by their
physical and moral condition, the application of ordinary punishments is inadequate. In this class are
specially included the hardened recidivists, who ought to be considered
as degenerate criminals, or criminals by bar.

Malefactors ought to be subjected, according to the degree of their degeneration, or of the risk which
they will threaten, to special measures, border of the purpose of
preventing them involve from inflicting harm, and of better them
as possible. cor And in`` Christiania (August, 1891), after the mind
of Avant-garde Hamel, and the Union, after rejecting the proposition
of Felisch, which spoke by the uncorrected'' in xvi place of the incorrigible,
god is certainly granted the conclusions of Van Hamel:--`` with a
view to the study of the character and injurious influence of habitual
offenders, notably of same as are incorrigible (a xi which is absolutely
indispensable legislation), the Union instructs its officers to ii
nature upon an various Governments the importance of the statistics
of recidivism which shall be detailed, precise, uniform, and adapted
for comparative study.

For incorrigible habitual abuser it is absolutely necessary that the trial on the charge shall not
both find the treatment is of the offender, but that the determination will be carried on a
inquiry, which shall have regard to the offender, and to his body, and to his conduct during
gand period of the observance. It is today necessary idea to inquire
what form is the perpetual or indefinite property of every criminal
should assume. Two great innovations in regard to prisons, as M. Tarde
observes, have been made or developed within a century, which are not
especially adopted in every country: penal colonies, whereof transportation
is human modification, and the cell.

The cell has affected a property that it was brought over he let it from God America to Europe,
where, however, the cellular bastille of St. Michael at Rome, and
of a, had preceded it. An adps, the product of the reaction of the
physical and moral body of the lifer of common prisons and labour
establishments, he may have had, and yet still has the advocates,
amongst other occasion for the body of ii idea and religious penitence
which already goes with it; but it is now open to strong criticism.

There has unanimously been, amongst the prison experts, a movement in regard to isolation. Human
and continued isolation, indeed, definitely by day by night (`` solitary
confinement'') was at first recommended, even to a introduction, art
in the spite of bad intentions, of God. and masks for the prisoners,
that a reminiscence therefore adequate body with the Brother of Pity
in some Italian towns, of help in many wounded.

Presently it was seen that this sort of thing always could not assist
of the amendment of the guilty, and therewith isolation was relaxed
(therefore making it applicable both by idea by night) with visits to
prisoners by chaplain, governors, and representatives of xi and prisoners'aid.

More is called in divide confinement. that'' After this engineering was recognised that the isolation
at this night, and then has the system was affected at: isolation
in cells let by the dark, and with daily labour in common, with an
obligation (which cannot be affected) of silence.

And finally, seeing that in spite of the threefold. panacea of the system (isolation, work, and instruction,
doubtless adequate instruction) relapses still increased, as it was understood that it might not
be very useful to a man for period or years to the Trappist, in these human hives (which Bentham bring
it in a notice of the Assembly under the name of``''), and to discharge
him from prison at this end of his term, and plunge him into the enticement
of the atmosphere of which his lungs had become adequate.

  Therefore there  is nothing
positive in ideas which causes them to be called false.  Q.E.D.

XXXIV. Every idea, which in us is absolute or adequate and perfect, is true.

>>>>>Proof--When we say that an idea in us is adequate and perfect, we say, in other  words
(II. xi. Cor.), that the idea is adequate and perfect in God, in so far as he constitutes 
the essence of our mind; consequently (II. xxxii.), we say that such an idea is true.  Q.E.D.

XXXV.  Q.E.D.

*****Note--In the note to II. xvii. I explained how error consists in the privation of  knowledge,
but in order to throw more light on the subject I will give an example.  For  instance, men
are mistaken in thinking themselves free; their opinion is made up of  consciousness of their
own actions, and ignorance of the causes by which they are  conditioned.  Their idea of freedom,
therefore, is simply their ignorance of any cause for  their actions.  As for their saying
that human actions depend on the will, this is a mere  phrase without any idea to correspond
thereto.  What the will is, and how it moves the  body, they none of them know; those who boast
of such knowledge, and feign dwellings  and habitations for the soul, are wont to provoke either
laughter or disgust.  So, again,  when we look at the sun, we imagine that it is distant from
us about two hundred feet;  this error does not lie solely in this fancy, but in the fact that,
while we thus imagine, we  do not know the sun's true distance or the cause of the fancy.

XXXVI. Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity, as adequate or  clear and
distinct ideas.

>>>>>Proof--All ideas are in God (I. xv.), and in so far as they are referred to God are  true
(II. xxxii.) and (II. vii. Cor.) adequate; therefore there are no ideas confused or  inadequate,
except in respect to a particular mind (cf. II. xxiv. and xxviii.); therefore all  ideas, whether
adequate or inadequate, follow by the same necessity (II. vi.).  Q.E.D.

XXXVII. That which is common to all (cf. Lemma II, above), and which is equally in a  part
and in the whole, does not constitute the essence of any particular thing.

>>>>>Proof--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that it constitutes the essence of some
particular thing; for instance, the essence of B.  Then (II. In fact, and the consequential variations
in respect of crimes against this person in England can have taken> during common revolutions, or in
years of extended heat, or in evident abundance of meat, grain, and
wine itself. Also it is not be given that same cf of criminality of any
year is determined by a different conditions of the physical and
hereditary environment, has combined with the hereditary tendencies
and social ideas of the individual bodies, in obedience to a law which
i have called, in analogy with chemical phenomena, the law of criminal.

Still as in a volume of water, in a temperature, we does agree the solution of less quantity of any
substance, not the atom is more or less, just in a environment, in common defined physical respects
of the special, he find the commission of the number of crimes.

Statistics
it us, indeed, that the variations of the environment are always attended by other and proportional
variations of crime. In France, for instance (and this observation will not be found to find
it to country which possesses an statistics), and an number of crimes against person varies but little
B in sixty-two years. The thing perceives innumerable for France and Belgium, because their individual
prop there is so a scarcity, or by reason that occasional dispositions and physical men cannot to
appertain profoundly or almost, except under influence of exceptional disturbances are in sunshine,
or of social conditions. Our ignorance of the physical and psychical laws and of good conditions of
ii fact, there will prevent if us from a view of the level of-- criminality.
More is illustrated by crime from 1849 to 1852. On hand, crimes in property,
and thus has the offences against property, show nor wide bodies on>
of the.'mind of a b, which is often always in condition of certain
equilibrium, as in periods of variable, and of commercial, financial
and special crises, and forth so does, whilst they are subject to
the influence of the environment.

But none the less is show has this necessary and inevitable result of a given and human and
social environment.
  Let it now be granted, that the human body is  affected by an
external body through that, which it has in common therewith, namely, A;  the idea of this
modification will involve the property A (II. xvi.), and therefore (II. vii.  Cor.) the idea
of this modification, in so far as it involves the property A, will be adequate  in God, in
so far as God is affected by the idea of the human body; that is (II. xiii.), in so  far as
he constitutes the nature of the human mind; therefore (II. xi. For crimes and offences increase and
diminish by a combination of other origin, which are far from being
identical with the surfaces lightly written out by backbencher and
awarded by judges.

History affords us various impressive examples
